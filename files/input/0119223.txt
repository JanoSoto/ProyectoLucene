Let me clear something up right away.  This is not a b-movie, a cheesy remake, or even a remake.  It is my understanding that this movie is loosely based on the Dickens' book, but that it does follow the themes, just not the exact story.  This is a great movie, it is a modern classic.          The acting is excellent.  Ethan Hawk is amazing, he really is a top notch actor. He's not just a young sexy leading man type who gets by on looks and a touch of acting (as I had previously thought since he looks like the typical Matt Dillion or a Lowe type).   Gwyneth Paltrow is absolutely stunning and plays her role perfectly.  De Niro has a nice, powerful role, and duh, he's awesome in this movie.  Anne Bancroft was hauntingly superb in this movie, you'll see what i mean.  Hank Azaria and Chris Cooper play great supporting roles.  I think this movie was probably Chris Cooper's breakthrough role, and he was great.      The movie was breathtakingly shot.  The cinematography was better then even the recent crouching tiger hidden dragon.  The movie gives you a feeling of awe and mystery because of it's settings.   It's a work of art.          The writing...based on a classic Dickens novel..come on it is superb.  No cheesy lines; yes there are heartfelt beautiful lines, but none cheesy or over-emotional or over the top dialogue.  The writing and actors clicked perfectly.       Need I say the story was both interesting and intriguing (based on Dickens' Great Expectations).  It may be loosely based or not, but it was GREAT.      The directing pulled everything together and added some nice tricks to make this movie a Modern classic.  And the way music was used to intensify this movie and when and where it was used was absolutely brilliant, and i suppose this is the director's job, WELL DONE.      The music was almost as important as the acting in this movie.  The musical score for this movie is one of the best I have ever encountered.  It makes this movie move you.  And just as good are the music (songs) the movie uses, how and when they are used.  This is one of the few movies that thrives on sound (music) to help create it's mood, power and emotion and it is done masterfully.      This movie is a masterpiece.  Beautiful on the eyes, ears, heart, and mind. I feel sorry for you if you don't ever get to experience this movie, it is a MUST see.

If what you want to find from this movie is an exact translation of the book you will be unimpressed.I personally loved this movie, it is completely stylish thanks to a brilliant soundtrack and the gorgeous leads Ethan Hawke and Gwyneth Paltrow (who is cast perfectly as the beautiful ice queen). They are helped along by a strong supporting cast of Anne Bancroft (wonderfully eccentric as Ms. Nora Dinsmoor), Chris Cooper and Robert DiNero. The problem, however, is that in trying to fit a story as long and complicated as &#145;Great expectations' into a 90 minute movie you loose a lot of the development of the characters necessary to identify and have an emotional reaction to them.Rather than linger on these issues Alfonso Cuaron concentrated on the visual aspect of the movie and the result is a movie that is great to watch!

Robert De Niro is in the movie only briefly, but brings respect to a role that could be just a flash in the pan for anyone else.

British novelist Charles Dickens's novel Great Expectations is the resource for this successful adaptation. I have read the novel, and it's an autobiographical drama and humour. I also saw the 1946 silver-screen adaptation, which was boring and indifferent than this novel; and I think it was indifferent on its own, as well. On the other hand, Alfonso Cuarón's Great Expectations is a transformation of a drama/comedy work of art into a romance. Besides, Alfonso Cuarón used his materials perfectly through matching the relations of these materials between each other 1- Ms.Dinsmoor and her oath of revenge against mankind, that composes feminism 2- Estella and her enchanting beauty, falling the trap of pride 3- Finn and his pure emotions, falling the trap of loving an insensitive beauty 4- The mysterious benefactor of Finn who bears compunction of his past actions in his life and thus is laying down all of his possessions to Finn, whom he knows as a good-hearted little kidThe screenplay is so powerful that solidifies the plot with new original features including surrealist drawings of Finn, that turns the movie a real work of art. Estella is the inspiration of Finn, of his love, of his work, of his success, of his life, ultimately of himself; that he finds and pursues the love of his life all the time. In addition, he stays loyal to Estella. There is the one great qualification of this movie that, lovers always stay loyal to each other. Although Estella has dated with rich businessmen and even married with them, she have always known that Finn was there waiting for her with complete determination and faith. They soon to come together to live happily ever after, like all the wholeheartedly love endings or non-endings. Read my synopsis for this movie, if you haven't got any chance yet to see it.

Personally i found the film very enjoyable and immersive, and the incredibly imaginative cinematography will certainly keep anyone's attention as well.This film is a stylish and brilliant remake of a classic and could almost be considered timeless compared to other recent attempts at updating the classics which fail in comparison(such as the recent failed attempt at romeo and juliet). Great Expectations is certainly worth a rental (or even purchase) for anyone that enjoys simply a good, immersive movie with some absolutely beautiful imagery.

Supurb performances. ***1/2 out of ****","Date":"30 July 1999","Score":"34 out of 51 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  Great Expectations (1998) ***1/2 Starring Ethan Hawke, Gwyneth Paltrow, Anne Bancroft, Chris Cooper, Robert DeNiro and Kim Dickens Director Alfonso Cuaron  111 minutes    Rated RBy Blake French The only thing keeping Great Expectations from being one of the best films of the year is the dialogue, which is too proper. The characters act like the everything they do must be out of perfection. When in reality, some of the film's characters would be gruff, careless people.The movie is spellbinding from the first shot. That is undoubtfully because of the character development, which so many movies fail at these days. And not only are they adequately developed, they are engaging. The audience can relate to them as well as understand them. Now these are signs of a superb movie in the making. The movie opens with a small boy, about ten years of age, being overtaken by a man who we later learn is a death sentenced escapee. He orders the pedestrian to bring selected materials to him early the next morning, and never to tell a soul of his terrifying experience. He does as he is told.The boy is named Finnegan Bell, a poor, unfortunate child who lives with his older sister and her husband. The uncle, Joe, soon excepts a job from an extraordinarily eccentric mistress, Ms. Dinsmoor, and her spoiled daughter, Estella. Under circumstances, Finn is able to meet the young girls, about ten years of age as well, and later on becomes close friends with her and the woman Years pass, Finn is still inevitably attracted to Estella, despite her emotionless personality. Unfortunately, she leaves the state to study her future career. Finn is devastated. He gives up his wonderful talent of art and goes into cruise drive for the next seven years. An offer is made to him almost a decade later, to move to New York, where Estella lives at this time, and pursue a career as a professional artist. He excepts, and soon after he arrives, his paths cross with his love once again, but things aren't as they seem at first sight. Do Finn and Estella follow a life of marriage together? Is Estella still interested in Finn, or does she have other romantic plans? I will not revel the answers to these questions. I will leave it up to you to watch this masterpiece destined to become a romantic classic. However, I will say that if you are not familiar with this old tale from Charles Dickens, things are very unpredictable, and this is not you typical, run-of-the-mill love story.The performances are truly Oscar worthy, too bad I didn't see this movie when I came out. For I am reviewing it a year later, because I saw it on video, for free, that is. But I certainly would have paid full price to screen this gem, just to tell others how mesmerizing it is.	I loved Anne Bancroft, as the crazy widow. She is gorgeous, breathtaking, and one of a kind, as is Paltrow, as Estella herself. Ethan Hawke performs a down-to-earth character with interest and convincing situation. Chris Cooper, Robert DeNiro and Kim Dickens all provide strong supporting role, especially De Niro, but none are on screen enough to make an actual mark.Another beautiful element in Great Expectations is the production design in the houses the atmosphere is all lush, glamorous and interesting. It provides the characters with a firm foundation, which they certainly take advantage of. As a matter of fact, everyone involved with the creation of the film takes careful interest into everything they do. For this is one of the most luscious movies of the decade.

None however have been done more boldly than the remoulding of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, and Charles Dicken's Great Expectations.  Both are daring attempts to rebirth a storyline from the distant past, as a tale told in our modern times.  I say attempt because in both cases, as good a job the cast and crew did, there was something lacking in these new renditions.  Great Expectations, the movie, lacks many qualities that make the novel a success.  It cannot be said to be a total loss, the basic elements are intact, it is only the embellishments Charles Dickens developed in the novel to make the story more realistic that are missing.One success, I must admit that I observed while watching the film was the rich visual setting.  Although not taking presented in the same place, or era Great Expectations, the movie, is a feast for the eyes.  It captivates the mind with beautiful shots of the rural Florida coast life, and yet still retains the jumbled, rundown atmosphere that is described of Pip's small birthplace in a small English town.  These qualities of squalor are evident in the impoverished coastal fishing village of the movie.  The best achievement in cinematography, is the in-depth views of Pardiso Perduto, a sister mansion to the decaying Satis house of the novel.  Even the scenes of New York, the city of expectations for our youthful protagonist, Finn, has contrasting aspects of rich beauty and unsightly slums that the London of the nineteen century demonstrated.  This is the most major achievement for the film; to capture on film a most ingenious modern equivalent of Charles Dicken's astute descriptions.Unlike some attempts to revamp literary successes the movie at least retains some of the dignity of Dicken's work.  The core of his novel is intact within the screenplay.  Also many ingenious ideas were used in some plot changes, and cinematography.  Overall it is not a bad representation of the novel.

Having read the book many times, it was a nice refreshing change. To make a movie exactly like the book would be tedious, boring, and dumb. The movie is based off the book, its not the book itself. The actor's portray the roles with eloquence and make the movie very believable. It's a tragically sad movie with bursts of beautiful music to draw the viewer in. Violins and haunting choruses give it its character (Tori Amos is the genius behind this along with many other fine artists). Overall, I would not say this is the best movie in the world, but one worth seeing. However, don't take my word for it, see the movie yourself and make a decision.

Regardless, the 1946 film was good movie-making; this is crap. That's putting it nicely.Just listen to the profanity in the first 15 minutes of this movie and tell me you feel like your into a Dickens novel. Come on! I guess that's part of the modernization of the his literary classic. The only profanity allowed should be critics discussing this sorry mess. Dickens getting a gratuitous screen credit as an author must have had him rolling over in his grave.The adventure of the original story is basically in this translation, which is mainly a love story. Since the female interest of Pip is not someone to admire or root for, it was better to have her as a minor character as in the '46 film, instead a major one here.Also, this rich-is-evil story that Hollywood loves is so hypocritical it's laughable. Most of the people who make these films are filthy rich and squander a lot of their money....but preach nonetheless. And....there is not enough difference these days between old money and new money to base a story around that theme.The only reason I didn't give this the minimum one star was the beautiful cinematography.

"},{"Title":"My Great Expectations were Disappointed","Date":"12 April 2006","Score":"11 out of 19 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Great Expectations is based around the odd conceit of taking the plot of Dickens's novel and updating it to late 20th century America. Apart from Joe and Estella, all the names of the characters have been changed. Pip becomes Finn Bell, Miss Havisham Miss Dinsmoor and Magwitch Arthur Lustig. Mrs Joe is Maggie, Bentley Drummle Walter and Jaggers Ragno. The plot follows the same basic outlines as in the novel. Finn is an orphan, cared for by his older sister and her boyfriend Joe, a fisherman on Florida's Gulf Coast. As in the book, Finn helps an escaped convict. As in the book, he becomes friendly with Estella, the adopted daughter of a wealthy reclusive lady. As in the book, he receives a financial windfall from a lawyer acting on behalf of a mysterious benefactor (who later turns out to be the convict). And as in the book, he falls helplessly in love with Estella, now a beautiful but icy young woman.The trouble with the film's central conceit- which is why I described it as odd- is that Great Expectations resists being translated into the modern age. Like most great nineteenth-century novels it is firmly rooted in a particular time and place, in this case London and South-East England in the early 19th century. (Shakespeare's plays, which do not have the same attachment to a specific time and place, are generally easier to transfer to a modern setting). Even when it was written it was something of a period piece, being set not during the 1860s when Dickens wrote it but rather during his own childhood in the 1810s and 1820s. Dickens is therefore describing social structures and institutions- many of them essential to his plot- which were forty years in the past even at the time of writing and which have no equivalents in modern society.When the film-makers try and find such equivalents, they end up doing violence to Dickens's plot. The most significant changes are those made to the characters of Finn/Pip and Lustig/Magwitch, which is unfortunate as the Pip-Magwitch relationship is perhaps the most important in the novel. In the novel, Pip's great ambition, which he realises through Magwitch's generosity, is to become a gentleman. This is a word with many shades of meaning, but Pip uses it to mean little more than a rich layabout, someone who has no need to work for a living and so can spend his life drinking, gambling and hanging out with other young men of a similar outlook. Once Pip has realised this ambition, he becomes an odious snob, ashamed of his lowly origins, of his adoptive father Joe (who has always treated him with great kindness) and even of his benefactor when he discovers who that person is. Finn, on the other hand, has a much more elevated and laudable ambition, dreaming of becoming an artist, and Lustig's benefaction enables him to set up in a New York studio.Magwitch- an unsuccessful petty thief- was a failure as a criminal who acquired his wealth honestly in Australia. Lustig, however, is not a reformed character but a gangster on the run whose sources of income are still dishonest ones. This has implications for the way in which we view the relationship between Lustig and Finn. Pip, whose good fortune is based upon nothing more than a stroke of luck (he helps Magwitch our of fear, not out of compassion) snobbishly looks down upon the man who has made that fortune possible by working hard and honestly. Finn, however, seems strangely unmoved by the fact that his good fortune is based upon sources of wealth tainted by criminality. This moral dilemma might have made for an interesting theme, albeit one not found in Dickens, but the film-makers largely ignore it. Unfortunately, they also ignore the moral concerns which were at the heart of Dickens's novel.No film based upon a literary text can ever be 100% faithful to its source, especially one taken from Dickens whose novels were known for their complex plots and for casts of literally hundreds of characters. David Lean's great version of Great Expectations, although considerably more faithful to the text than this one, simplifies the plot considerably- for example, it omits the Orlick sub-plot altogether. The important point, however, is that Lean fully understood what Dickens was trying to achieve and remained faithful to the spirit of his work. There is no sign of such understanding or fidelity in Alfonso Cuaron's film.There were some good things about the film. It was attractively shot, particularly the scenes set in Miss Dinsmoor's crumbling mansion Paradiso Perduto. (As a number of reviewers have pointed out, Cuaron seems to have a particular liking for the colour green). There were effective cameos from Robert de Niro as Lustig and Anne Bancroft as Miss Dinsmoor. The main parts, however, were less well played. Ethan Hawke played Finn as a sort of love-sick puppy I could never conceive of him as a talented artist. Gwyneth Paltrow was well able to convey Estella's haughty, glacially beautiful exterior, but there is no sense, as there was with Valerie Hobson's performance in Lean's film, that this is a mask she has been forced to put on by her adoptive mother and which hides an insecure, vulnerable person inside.I have never seen any of Cuaron's Spanish-language films, but I was very impressed by his English-language A Little Princess. (That film also involved transposing a classic English novel to America, although it kept the book's period setting). His Great Expectations was, however, not in the same class. It departs from Dickens's novel too radically to succeed as a cinematic version of a literary text. On the other hand, it sticks too closely to his plot to succeed on any other level. My great expectations of it were disappointed. 4/10 "},{"Title":"Why don't they just use a different title?","Date":"28 March 2011","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" I've watched this movie right after I read the novel by Dickens and it was a great disappointment.

Not to say that the works of Dickens can't be updated as Great Expectations is here, but the whole premise of the novel is sacrificed.A lot of the framework of the original novel is left intact though the location is now Florida in the late 20th Century instead of Victorian England. Young Finn (Pip) finds an escaped convict Robert DeNiro whom he aids at first against his will. Later on the rich and eccentric Anne Bancroft sends for him as a playmate companion for her niece Estella. After that good things just keep coming his way and Pip develops some Great Expectations about his prospects.In the novel our protagonist Pip goes into business, but in this case young Finn now grown up Ethan Hawke becomes a painter and he gets a few unseen boosts up the ladder of success. He and Estella now Gwyneth Paltrow can't seem to live with each other or without each other. She goes for and against Hawke on a whim even at one point marrying someone else.I don't object to the modernization of a classic, it might inspire some to check out the original article and that certainly is a worthy goal. But even in sacrificing Dickens's concern for social justice to make this a romance, the ending is changed. I think Dickens would most object to the ending in this film which most assuredly is not what Dickens wrote. The ending for Hawke and Paltrow could have been kept within the spirit of the original novel.Robert DeNiro has now put his own interpretation on three classic movie portrayals of the past, Robert Mitchum in Cape Fear, Richard Widmark in Night And The City, and now Finlay Currie as the escaped convict Magwitch. His part is completely updated to 20th Century America and still it's in the spirit of what Dickens wrote for Magwitch.This version of Great Expectations is a nice romantic film, but it's not in any way what Charles Dickens was writing about.

As a love story the film holds its own - Hawke and Paltrow seem to have a chemistry that does not come off as forced as in some of their other respective works.  There are slight hints at the humor that riddled Dickens' work, but perhaps more enjoyable is the endearing relationship between Uncle Joe and young Finn (Chris Cooper and Jeremy Kissner).  Along these lines comes the brief yet memorable performance by the acting great Robert De Niro, who plays the escaped convict Arthur Lustig.  It is rare anymore to get a truly great Hollywood love story, let alone a decent one.  All to often love is portrayed as a quirky and cute emotion rather than one of trial and tribulation.  It is relieving every once in a while to have a love story without Julia Roberts or Hugh Grant or, at times, both.

See David Lean's superb 1946 version if you want to see the best screen adaptation of any Dickens work, and see this movie for what it is, a beautifully realized and visually arresting film. The secret to approaching this version is contained right at the beginning of the film, where the older Finn, as narrator, informs us that the story is not to be told as it actually happened, but as it's remembered. Hence the unreal, surreal quality of the scenes in the crumbling mansion inhabited by Nora Dinsmoor and her niece Estella. Fortunately, the elaborate set designs of these earlier scenes are carried through to the later New York scenes, where a modern city is made to look a little artificial and unreal, exactly perhaps as a young artist would see it. Don't criticize Ethan Hawke for the somewhat passive performance he gives, as his character is essentially a spectator for most of the narrative, carried along by events largely out of his control. It's at the end of the film that you will notice his emerging confidence and action. The little girl who plays the young Estella makes a strong impression, and this is carried over into Gwyneth Paltrow's interpretation as the older, mysterious and changeable young woman. The only major criticism I would make of the film is the unnecessary and unconvincing happy ending that just doesn't ring true, and was mentally rejected by this viewer and probably most others.

Cuáron's film holds up fairly well; it is beautifully shot, in heat-soaked colours (having been relocated to south Florida), a far remove from Lean's cold, naturalistic black and white with forced-perspective sets. The new film is also energized by some vivid acting in secondary roles, especially Anne Bancroft and Robert DeNiro.What cripples it, unfortunately, is a 90s mentality that sacrifices the most interesting parts of Dickens's narrative, for the sake of a myopic fixation on the love story between Finn (Pip) and Estella. The novel is about many things (including its astonishing array of vivid secondary characters, many of them unforgettable), but it is laid out within a trajectory of a warm- hearted young boy growing up in poverty aggravated by the self-centeredness of most of those around him, his rise to prosperity aided by a mysterious benefactor, during which he himself is corrupted, and his collapse when he discovers how mistaken he has been about many things (especially about the identity of that benefactor). In the aftermath, he discovers some genuine humanity in himself, as he is impelled to make real sacrifices to rescue his benefactor, and is himself rescued by the one truly decent character in the book.The heart of this trajectory is gone in the film. Finn is lifted up to success by a benefactor, but never confronts any demons in himself as a result of this generosity; his friend and roommate in the novel, Herbert Pocket, who shares his degradation, is left out of the film altogether. Finn never needs rescuing, and the character of Joe (one of Dickens's great creations) is much diminished; the talented Chris Cooper is given little to do, and comes across as someone to be pitied and tolerated rather than admired. Finn just goes from success to success as an artist; he never makes any sacrifices for anyone. Estella (in some ways, only a minor character in the book) is in almost every scene of the middle of the film...because those seem to be the only ones the filmmakers care about.Perhaps this film is best viewed without any reference to Dickens at all? Its love story is certainly passionate and sensual; Paltrow is beautiful (and not just in her nude modeling scene), but unfortunately Hawke is, as usual, flat and bland. That flatness is actually appropriate for a film of the novel (John Mills, a similarly bland actor, is effective in Lean's film, because Pip is to some extent a blank slate written on by those around him), but it's disastrous for a love story; what does Estella see in him? One is left at the end with the suspicion that she ultimately grabs hold of Finn the successful artist because he's successful and can support her and her daughter, now that her other lovers have left her.To be honest, the conclusion is the worst part of the novel, too. Dickens had originally written an ending where a more mature Pip meets a miserable, cynical Estella years later, and is able to observe her dispassionately, from some distance; given that she had been trained by a master (Miss Havisham) to hate and exploit men, this was probably the only conceivable ending for their story. But then he listened to advice from his friend Bulwer-Lytton, and replaced that plausible and moving ending for a Hollywood-anticipating reconciliation and fade-out (which is indeed adopted by both films). The revision made readers happier, but you didn't want to think too carefully about what kind of life Pip and Estella were going to have together...

While not totally faithful to the Charles Dickens classic it is very much a film worth seeing.The plot is simple boy loves girl. They grow into adults girl leaves only to reappear in the young mans life. Will he finally get her?The setting is NY, sophisticated and snobbish. The use of the color green is amazing. Ethan Hawke portrays the hero Finn, and Gwyneth Paltrow the tempting Estella. I found both to be quite good in their roles and the fountain kisses both as children and adults are some of the best. Other than the acting I found Cuarons direction to be some of the best and am a huge fan of his work. I love his whole obsession with green! It is a color with interesting meaning. Finn of course meets Estella as a boy, a poor boy, at the home of the eccentric Ms DInsmoor ( Now that is a creep show in itself!) I believe it is Anne Bancroft who plays the heartbroken Ms Dinsmoor. What a whack job! The home or shall I say her mansion is something out of a romantic fairy tale. She lives there with her niece Estella, though I think grandmother/granddaughter looks more accurate. After being dumped at the alter Ms Dinsmoor brings Estella up to fear love and cruelly toss men aside, enter Finn who is the perfect practice devise. MEAN! Finn is an artist who goes to the mansion for dance lessons with Estella, at the request of Ms Dinsmoor. They grow to young adults and what a tease Estella is! What a lovesick man Finn is!Estella leaves not telling Finn, but Ms Dinsmoor has no problem tearing out poor Finns heart. He leaves the mansion and settles on the fact that he'll never see his beloved again, gives up art and has a life as a fisherman. Than as fate would have it ( as is so often the case) an anonymous benefactor comes to makes Finns dreams come true. He is to go to NY and make his claim in the art world. Finn thinks this is Ms Dinsmoor way of making him equal with Estella. After years of separation Finn sees Estella again and the feelings return, but this time he is ready for success.Finn would clearly do anything for Estella and however manipulated she was as a child I myself wanted to shake her and say What are you thinking! Finn is sensitive and Estella cold, but even she cannot deny her feelings which is why she is so avoiding. It is heartbreaking the final scene Finn has with wretched Ms Dinsmoor. As a child Ms Dinsmoor places boy Finns hand on her chest. When she asks Finn what he feels he honestly replies 'your boob', but than she proceeds to tell him no this is her heart and it is broken. Fast forward a good ten years and now it is Finn asking Ms Dinsmoor for her wrinkled, brown, nicotine stained hand. He repeats the encounter from years before only the roles are reversed and it is Finn who has the broken heart. Ms Dinsmoor at the moment drops out of her insane world and realizes how destructive she was. A touching scene.A great film, I found the Robert De Niro character a bit forgettable, but all in all the films fantastic the leads are good, crazy ms dinsmoor is despicable and even the stereotypical NY artist are fun to watch and very pretty sounding musical score.

It's been eleven years. When I first saw the movie in 1998, I remember feeling so moved by it, I parked my car in a strange place near the highway in Santa Ana (Main Place, I think) and just stood there, sad, feeling like everything was gone and never to return.

Don't try to relate it with Dicken's novel. Sweathearts, it's not a film that lays everything right out in the open - you have to pay attention and read facial expressions.For those who DID see Great Expectations in its original release and miss all the class-distinctions it depicted and the full development of characters, and its message that the jilted bride reared Estella for the sole purpose to be a heartbreaking bitch - what can I say? I missed all of that, too - I did a camp characterization of that lady in my nightclub-act.......always recognized......HOWEVER, Anne Bancroft WAS the movie for me, and she should have had much more time on-screen. Her acting was stellar for modern audiences - to have her sit-around in her wedding-dress for the whole picture would have cleared the theater.....just not what a ditzy broad would do in 1998. Name me one other actress (still alive) of her caliber who would allow themself to be so hideously aged for the role? Her costumes were a riot, giving me the notion she may have been a drag-queen. Besame Mucho was the perfect score for her scenes. Can you imagine what nasty things she was whispering in young Finn's ear ??? She'll break your heart anyway was her battle call - don't you suspect she taught Estella to swap tongues at the drinking-fountain ? AND - I want to assure Live_for_Alice young Finn DID mention that she had been jilted, and everything for the wedding-reception was left under the tents; in fact, that's one of the few bits of the Dicken's novel that was left-in. Bancroft's acting in the New York mansion was superb - to get a close look at the old biddy without her costumes was priceless, as was give me your hand.......Director Alonzo Cuaron certainly got it all together for this movie, although it's difficult to watch at times. This is not the usual love-story. Most users' comments that young-and-growing-up Finn was underplayed, Cuaron got the necessary acting from Ethan Hawke - he was NAIVE, not dumb ! Horny, not shy. The progression into near adulthood was beautifully filmed, with Paltrow (Estella) making it perfectly clear she would not appear at the ritzy party with such a nice kid - he was just too poor - in a truck with tools in it, yet. She played the ultimate girl who was reared to be icy, but the fire raged below. Enough of Ms. Paltrow - I'm not one of her fans, except for The Talented Mr. Ripley. I wouldn't rush to see another movie with Hawke in it, either.I loved Uncle Joe, because he was unashamedly low-class, but so proud of his kid. Chris Cooper was the other star of this film - my heart broke for him at the gallery, because HIS heartbreak was palpable, to realize all his pride was in vain. Yet, he was thrilled when Finn returned to Florida. As most realize, this guy is an actor. DeNiro was great, too - scared me to death when he came-up out of the water. He convinced ME that he would have done all those horrific things he threatened Finn with; someone wrote the two had traveled in the motorboat for hours all night, but that scene was shot in the early morning. The Coast Guard apprehended them in that same bay. DeNiro's reappearance at the end was great, and made Finn realize what a Rick-with-a-P he was......all that work to be set-up and bought by one true friend. A gripping scene.....so vital to all the other hidden emotions. OH - for hizhanzr, they DID have another artist do all that modern stuff. Ugh!Mitch Glazer's script was what the story called-for and you wonder if it were written as the filming was done. He should have stuck to the Dicken's novel to have Nutty Auntie still in Paradiso Perduto and have it burn-down around her........WOW ! That would have made the very weak, forgiving scene between Estella and Finn even more realistic. They would have known just whom it was that almost ruined their lives.I can understand how some people just couldn't perceive this to be a true story - but, all the craziness was essential. The movie's central theme of class-distinction and great wealth may be great to have, but it certainly didn't buy happiness. Yes, the cinematography was so wonderful, especially with the mansion falling apart. The original Great Expectations is still my favorite, but this film is very thought-provoking and entertaining - especially with the nutty antics of Anne Bancroft. Brava!!! My VHS-copy is flawless, so I'm looking forward to owning the DVD.Those folk who can't get lost in this gripping movie are passing-up a wonderful experience - SEE THIS MOVIE AGAIN......

"},{"Title":"Great What?!","Date":"1 May 2001","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  Some stories are meaningful only within the context of their historical period. To modernize them, one must discard most of what motivates the characters. The beauty of a Dickens novel is its detail; its very long character development, and his social commentary packaged so that the very people about whom he was complaining would read his work. In fact they luxuriated in his work. It was delivered to his public in installments, a kind of enlightened soap opera.Sadly, there is no character development in this film at all! The relationship between the two lead characters, Finnegan 'Finn' Bell, played by Ethan Hawke and Estella, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, simply makes no sense. Even assuming that Great Expectations is no more than a simple love story as the filmmakers seem to assert, you have to ask yourself; are Finn and Estelle in love and if they are in love, then how did it happen?The dilemma in the original story is that the two children, are from different classes, in a rigid class system, and it is their entrapment in this class system that makes the story work. The film ignores this completely offering no reasonable alternative and disintegrating into chaos from the very beginningOur modern Estelle is the product of emotional child abuse. She is raised to hurt men, drilled over and over again to break their hearts - she is trained to be an emotional predator. She needs to practice to be any good and so is provided with a Straw Dog - Finn. He is portrayed as the product of poverty living in a crowded environment unable to avoid seeing his sister and her boyfriend carry on in a co-dependent drug centered sexual relationship. He would have learned to view women in the way he had experienced them in his life. As objects to be used and abused by the men in their lives. I guess we are supposed to assume the he was saved from destruction by the love he shares with his substitute father, Uncle Joe played by Chris Cooper (I), but if Uncle Joe is so loving then why did he allow the object of his love to endure the abuse. Why didn't he kick his promiscuous niece out of the house to protect the child he supposedly loved so much. Uncle Joe is a flake and does nothing to protect the boy, so by his tenth year our  Straw Dog would have grown a few teeth.Here is an example of the kind of lunacy that plagues the film from start to finish.Early on in the film the boy encounters an escaped convict, Arthur Lustig played by Robert De Niro, who threatens to kill him horribly if he doesn't journey several miles over water to get him supplies and bring them back without telling anyone. I don't know why the kid does what he is told to do, maybe he'd seen De Niro's other films (like Cape Fear (1991), Raging Bull (1980), or Taxi Driver (1976)) and new better than to mess with him. Or maybe he is simply impressed by Lustig, whose ankles are all chewed up from running around in chains, standing there knee deep in salt water without so much as a whimper. What ever the lame reason, off he motors without a shopping list and brings back such essentials as the narcotic Demerol and a bottle of alcohol (oh right I see now he is afraid of Lustig who is miles away but no one in the very same house is going to miss the Demerol - give me a break). Our Straw Dog takes the time to make the guy a sandwich and brings him a pair of enormous bolt cutters as if he had been given the specs for the leg chains he hadn't even seen yet. Now Lustig, a convicted killer, has been waiting for the boy's return all day. He is in pain, on the run; hungry and it is dark , but he grabs the little prescription bottle reads the label in the dark in a snap (the guy is over forty and isn't wearing glasses). He wolfs down an undisclosed amount of the pills of undisclosed strength in combination with about a third of the bottle of booze (say good night Artie) then eats the sandwich as if he still had an appetite and all the time in the world, when by rights, he should have passed out, died, or at least lay there in a stupor. Not our boys, the two wrestle the boat into the sea and on one tank of gas for the out board motor, spend all night motoring along until the sun comes up. That would be about nine to ten hours.  But that wasn't brainless enough, the two of them together, one an experienced con the other a gifted artist, couldn't figure out that bright orange is not the best colour to be wearing if you are on the run. But then again apparently the coast guard officers aren't too bright anyway as they never heard of binoculars, and can't see this guy floating around in the water like some huge orange popsickle in the bright sunlight.The film is filled with nonsense like this from beginning to end.Neither child would have had any skill with the opposite sex nor have given any value to genuine intimacy, even if they did know what it was. Both would have had emotional disorders and behaved more like predators than children as that is what they had learned. Both would have been filled with rage, and would have had to be kept apart to prevent them from killing each other.This film not only bears no relationship to Dickens, but also bears no relationship to common sense or reason.

Believe me I'm very eager to read Dicken's original novel, because I'm not willing to believe that he didn't want to tell a much better story. Maybe I might even try to think of a better way to adapt it to modern time.Modern time requires moments of intimacy, these moments, the scenes of seduction, are always too flat or too predictable, maybe both.It starts off quite decent when they are children, because it has some sense of a world apart. But then the two kids turn into Ethan Hawke and Gwyneth Paltrow like nothing had happened at all. I see two young people, supposed to be maybe 17, 19, 21, I can't tell, acting like there hasn't been a change to anything in the past seven or more years. These strange people I haven't met before are now leaving a beautifully colored, eerily otherwordly castle to get into an ugly greasy car of the eighties, surrounded by crass metallic colors in an ambience that reminds me of McDonald's or something. Was it still the same movie I was watching?They will go to New York and Paris, aging and obeying their fortune, for no particular reason. The storyline works quite decently but it goes there without excitement. Everything that happens serves the destiny of our two protagonists to meet again. That feeling doesn't work out however, it rather seems to serve the intention of the director to have his two co-stars together in as many scenes as feasible. I'm not too impressed by the acting of any of the leads. Ethan Hawke doesn't portray anything more than an all-American boy type, Gwyneth Paltrow is straight, constant, unshifting and pale. I was expecting coldness and vulnerability from her character, I received nothing. Chris Cooper, who plays Ethan's loving brother-in-law, is in the picture like a radio DJ talking to people he neither knows nor sees.I was feeling deprived of even the last little piece of magic I was hoping for. Then almost every single line of dialogue made me feel uncomfortable. Robert De Niro was nothing more than decent, but Anne Bancroft was shining like a lonely flower on a pavement with the films most complex performance.

It just seemed like another of the ten films that Gwyneth Paltrow does each year. However, this film has a good story, above-average performances and some of the most artistic visuals I have seen in any recent films.The main storyline of this film was adapted from the famous Dickens novel of the same name. Only the names of the characters and the time that the story takes place are changed. The central theme of the film is based on the forbidden love between Finn (Ethan Hawke) and Estella (Paltrow) and how they can never achieve it. At the cause of this is Estella's aunt who was left at the alter many years ago by her rich fiance, making her vow to get back at all men. She decided to use the enchanting Estella as bait for the unsuspecting victim. That person being Finn is captivated by Estella for many years, never really reaching her along the way. Eventually Estella leaves and breaks Finn's heart accomplishing her aunt's goal.Both Hawke and Paltrow give good performances to this film, but are both overshined by the shorter performances by Anne Bancroft (Estella's aunt) and Robert DeNiro (a convict who supports Finn's art career). I believe that if DeNiro's performance had more to do with this film, it would have been one of my favourites of 1998. The direction of this film is nearly flawless and the cinemtography is award-worthy. The way the atmosphere of Florida and New York are captured simply haven't been done in most other films.Perhaps the only thing lacking in this film was a true ending and you might understand what I mean if you have seen this film.

And how they always came back to haunt us, whether silently, while alone in the middle of the night, bringing on the shuddering terror that just wouldn't stop until we reluctantly climbed from bed under the first rays of sunlight, or out in the middle of it all, a sudden urge to crawl into the arms of someone who loved you back, someone ideal, someone from a book.

So I followed her advice and I went to the videoclub to take the film. Just the beginning was simply inspiring. I felt like if I were going to be present at something important. The way they speak and the dialogues caused a very good impression on me because I could easily realize how the boy was feeling and how the girl was playing with him. Scences like the one at the font make me feel expectant. But what impressed me the most, was the fact that all along the film, the main character was the green color because it appeared in every scene as a clue.

That the Magwitch role has been given to Robert DeNiro is typical of this film's ambition; that he is nothing like as scary as Finlay Currie in the original is symbolic of this version's failure to quite overcome the obstacles put in its way. Adding some raunchiness and colour to the story helps, the modern, swampy southern US setting works out OK, even having Miss Haversham transform into a ditzy grand old dame isn't too bad, and the cast is passable throughout. Somehow, though, it just isn't quite there, the story really needs the social structure it satirizes to hold everything together. The admittedly class-ridden society of the modern US is a far simpler structure, one of extreme wealth looking down on extreme poverty, without the added difficulty of ancient breeding structures to overcome. Dickens' Pip could never truly escape his squalid upbringing, as Ethan Hawke does here; modern society could have no problem with him winning his Estella. What it all boils down to is a sad story about a poor kid who gets caught up with a rich tease, with added incidental odds and ends tagged on around, lacking the epic sweep, societal critique and flowing unity of the novel.

Well it's not that bad at all. It didn't matter to me that the movie wasn't exactly faithful to Dickens novel (frankly I didn't even read the book, and even if I had it wouldn't matter), it was the movie itself that I was watching.  And the first half just flew by. I can't remember the last time I was watching a movie I was enjoying and before I knew it it was more than halfway through. Jeremy James Kissner was excellent, I'm talking Haley Joel Osment in The sixth sense excellent, and he was just as good. The first half is very entertaining and funny, mainly due to Anne Bancroft's character. The scene where young (and old) Finn drinks from the fountain and Estella leans over and tongues him is highly (read -sooooooooooo) erotic it's bound to give any man a hardon because Gwyneth Paltrow (although she probably has a bulimic thing going on) is sooooooooooo sexy and attractive in this movie. Anyway, I don't believe I'm saying this but De Niro singlehandedly ruined the movie (well , mostly his character anyway) because the first impression I got when he suddenly appeared out of the water was that he was playing Max Cady from Cape fear all over again, only this time he came back without the southern accent. The part in the end where he enlightens Finn with his true motives is pure idiocy. They meet after a period of about 15 years and he emphasizes how important it is to him that Finn is so successful and bla bla bla, believe me there's absolutely no logic.Ethan Hawke is OK, but at moments shows some signs of bad acting. It's Gwyneth that steals the show. This is a movie that teases and plays with the viewer as far as the erotic portion of the movie is concerned and it left me semi satisfied but definitely feeling very horny.  If De Niro's character had some logic, therefore not ruining the ending, and had he been played by someone else this movie would have been much better.Oh, and right at the end when the main characters hold hands, they do it in such a wearisome manner that it left me wondering if they ever even loved each other.

I'm a sucker for men confessing their hearts and souls, in the rain, to a distant woman standing aloof on a balcony.  Very Romeo and Juliet in its desperation.However, the movie did not deliver.  Chris Cooper (Uncle Joe) was actually the only character that stood out to me as acting real.  Gweneth Paltrow, playing her character to a tee, actually prevented the story from becoming a heartstrings type of love tale.  From Dickens' novel, she was right in playing the ice queen, and because it was never meant to be a reciprocated love affair, Paltrow was wonderful.This tale is about unrequited love.  And while Paltrow did her best on the cool, distant end of things, Ethan Hawke was depressingly mediocre.  With all his longing stares and puppy eyes, there was no indication that he was free of the bonds of his life in order to fully give himself to his obsession.  For most of the movie, chanelling his feelings into his art seemed an acceptable distraction.  There was no fire.Finally, about the story and the adaptation.  One of the main themes in Dickens' novel has to do with the guilt that Pip (Finn) feels after discovering that his benefactor is a criminal.  It brings into question his ambition, the truth about his success, and his own feelings of inadequacy around rich socialites (I mean, how at ease could you feel once you had learned that the only way you are able to hob-nob with the wealthy was because a murderer paid your way?).  This revelation was again supposed to distance him from Stella, because he might as well have been poor, living off of money that was not of his own making.  Because this aspect was underplayed to the point of non-existence, there was no real impact upon learning about Robert De Nero's true role in Finn's life.Despite the lovely cinematography (it had a very stylish feel), overall, this movie was weak--weak in its adaptation, its feeling, its depth.  There was no driving fire that propelled the two characters along star-crossed paths.  There was simply ambling along with misunderstandings and compromise.

He is believable and invokes much sympathy from the audience. Gwyneth Paltrow is superb as Estella, who conjures some hostility because of her rejection of Finn, but at the same time is capable of evoking sympathy. The way she acts is not her fault because she does not know any better. Robert De Niro puts in an excellent performance as the escaped convict who scares Finn as a young boy and has a major influence on his life. Anne Bancroft is wonderful as the eccentric Ms. Dinsmoor who acts out her hostility towards men through Estella. Great Expectations feels a lot like a foreign film, with its story of complicated love and its artistic visuals and music. It feels like the director of this movie is in fact a European or possibly Latin American filmmaker, and probably an accomplished one.

I feel he was successful with 'A Little Princess' but this one has more difficulties. Dinsmoor has the manipulativeness but she doesn't have the madness in this version. Ethan Hawke's blond hair is distracting. He may not be a good fit for the role. Maybe it's all in the hair. On the other hand, Gwyneth is perfect for the role.

Ultimately, it appears that fate has the whims of one man and one woman, which I define as fantastic in the plot of the film, which catches the eye with some very good acting or directing. Even the appearance of Robert De Niro failed to make the film one of those movies. My opinion on the subject is this - what is there in the end?

Meanwhile, the cold woman softens by the years, began to think and rethink her life and her inadequate behavior and softens. And at some point of intersection of these two processes they come together to live together. Well, yes but I do not think so! Such a situation is worthy only in a movie and a movie from that class. As much as I am a romantic, I can not find a place for such behavior (especially the male role) in life.The rest - about the talent that if you develop it, it'll make way in your life and you will meet people to go with you in one direction, for that I agree.

The look of the picture is unreal and unfortunately, ends up being the film's fault. It's such a good looking picture, when it comes to analytical thought, it ends up being a looky film, not a thoughtful one. It almost sleepwalks through scenes that were written with potential to scratch deep into character's minds, but decides not to take the extra mile. Great Expectations doesn't deliver the inside of the movie, just the outside. I enjoy the update of this old tale, the film's story is an interesting one. It intrigues the audience because we can all relate to wanting something that is better than us; we love the things that are unattainable. It tries to takes some profound stances on topics, but doesn't succeed, because the director, Alfonso Cuaron, and the actors have a problem communicating information of the character's thoughts to the audience. Everything we should get becomes obscure. Ethan Hawke doesn't row down the riverbank, nor does he sink, he just floats, not affecting any of the actors, not the director, he's just there to look nice and move the adaptation from scene to scene. Gwyneth Paltrow embodies the aspects of a first love nicely. Robert DeNiro has some great short scenes in the film, but the ultimate twist in the end ruins his character for me. I thought the twist was excessive and unnecessary. It cheapened the story and the solid ground the film built upon. Great Expectations sets out with great intentions, seeking to lecture the audience about kindness, love, and that in success comes tragedy, but the film is like looking through the glass windows of your favorite shopping store in the mall with an empty wallet. It's stunning to look at, but fails to psychologically tell the story. Great Expectations celebrates art as well, I wish Cuaron would've dug deeper into the thoughts, motivations, and intentions of the characters because the audience is left empty.

A Little Princess director Alfonso Cuarón and Scrooged scenarist Mitch Glazer maintain that venerable Tinsel Town tradition with the latest cinematic adaptation of Great Expectations, a boy-meets-girl and boy-loses-girl tearjerker. Ethan Hawke, Gwyneth Paltrow, Robert De Niro, and Anne Bancroft topline this entertaining but offbeat social drama. Tony Burrough's elegant production designs, Reality Bites lenser Emmanuel Lubezki's lush cinematography, and Cuaron's own poetic vision bolster Great Expectations far above Glazer's loquacious as well as predictable screenplay. Great Expectations qualifies easily as either a chick flick or a date flick, unless you're going to compare it with the six previous versions produced either for the silver screen or the boob tube.Unless you have scanned the Cliff Notes for Great Expectations recently, you may find yourself swamped by this free-spirited adaptation. Hollywood has changed some things. Glazer uproots the plot from its original Victorian English setting and transplants it to contemporary Florida. Charles Dickens named his protagonist Pip, but Glazer gives him the name Finn. Undoubtedly, literary types are struggling to figure out what a Mark Twain nickname and an Ernst Hemingway setting can have in common with a Dickens tale. Me, too. My B.A. was in English Literature and I've never seen Dickens like this. Not only does Glazer rechristen his lead character, but also he rechristens Miss Havisham as Ms. Dinsmoor. The criminal Magwitch is now Arthur Lustig, a death-row inmate who killed a mob boss. Estella is still Estella. Of course, Cuarón has altered several other things, too, but that will give you literature professors something to bitch about in class. Condensing a Dickens' epic in less than two hours in a film with names that you can pronounce might have something to do with this nonsense.Briefly, Finnegan Bell (Ethan Hawke of Dead Poets Society) takes life easy in sunny coastal Florida, just the kind of lifestyle Huckleberry Finn would yearn for in his wildest dreams. Orphaned, Finn resides with Maggie, his weirdo sister (Kim Dickens of Brazil), and Joe, his lower class, brother-in-law, handyman (Chris Cooper of Lone Star). Joe has trouble keeping food on the table and money in his pocket, so Maggie bails on them. Great Expectations makes women look like kennel club members, while the men emerge as good people who take care of one other. Finn spends his time cruising around in his outboard when he is not drawing pictures. Francesco Clemente received credit for those drawings, but he must have been channeling Walter Anderson. One day, the vicious convict Lustig (Robert De Nero of Goodfellas) surprises Finn and forces him to help him escape. The escape plan goes sour for Lusting, but Finn gets away. Finn fares far less lucky during his next encounter. He meets an eccentric unmarried woman, Ms. Dinsmoor (Anne Bancroft of The Graduate). She is a dotty old dame abandoned at the altar by a worthless suitor. Languishing away in a magnificent mansion that has gradually gone to seed since her disastrous wedding day, Dinsmoor has left things the way they had been set up for the wedding ceremony. Great Expectations looks like a feminine version of Heart of Darkness, but let us not trash a great guy like Joseph Conrad.Ms. Dinsmoor, it seems, wants a playmate for her snotty niece Estella, so she pages and pays for Finn. Poor Finn is immediately entranced by the cold, haughty Estella. Estella shocks Finn with a surprise kiss at a water fountain, and the filmmakers make that a recurring scene. When Finn reveals that he cannot dance for her, Ms. Dinsmoor allows him to draw. Reluctant initially to pose, Estella finds herself forced to sit for his portrait. Finn thinks she is beautiful but snobbish. Ms. Dinsmoor lectures Finn about the incompatibility of the sexes and the irony of love. Every time Finn meets Estella, she treats him indifferently, leaving him before anything can happen. She is the stuck-up, ice maiden of all time until the ending, but until then Finn recklessly pursues her. The unhappy day comes when Estella leaves Florida and travels to France for her education. Meanwhile, Finn sticks around Florida, works with Joe as a commercial fisherman and gives up painting. Suddenly, fortune befriends inn. Not only does he learn a benefactor has paid his airfare to New York City, but also that an art show is scheduled for his work. Quickly, Finn pulls together some new works and becomes an overnight sensation. Nevertheless, he still has problems with Estella. She takes up with a well-heeled architect, Walter Plane (Hank Azaria), and Finn's dreams appear to elude him again&#x97;almost, but you will have to suffer through the sorrow to see what happens.Great Expectations is a sensational looking picture. Emmanuel Lubezki's postcard photography is so gorgeous that at times it distracts you from the story. Everything in Great Expectations has a soft, ethereal texture. Tony Burroughs' cluttered looking production designs come the closest to recapturing the Victorian spirit of Charles Dickens. The Dinsmoor mansion is fantastic in its excessive, back-to-nature grunge. The story maybe as old as Dickens, but director Alfonso Cuarón makes it a richly palatable experience. He jump-starts the action occasionally. For example, during a dancing scene between the young Finn and Estella, Cuarón dissolves to the grown-up Finn and Estella without altering the scenery. Cuarón is especially adept with the appropriate light touch in treating the erotic scenes with flair and ingenuity. Paltrow strips for Hawke in one scene (remind you of Titanic) so he can draw her in the nude. Meantime, the only nudity shown appears on paper. A later erotic encounter tastefully skirts the issue by letting your imagination do the rest. See, it's a chick flick. If you want a good cry, Great Expectations will live up to your anticipations. It's not a Great movie, but it is a Good one.

The surrealism of the scene starts with the fact that he happens to know exactly which restaurant they are in. He walks in and asks Estella to dance. In the background her fiancée is trying to remain composed, keeping a politely bemused look on his face as this stranger starts dancing with his fiancée, and then starts to walk her out of the restaurant. Kudos to Ethan Hawke in this moment, who captures perfectly someone whose impulses have overridden any sense of propriety, who in that moment takes control of their relationship for the first time. Estella watches him as she leads him out of the restaurant, slightly in awe of the new Finn.I can't think of any other film that has illustrated the attraction between two people more skilfully. Such an underrated film.

On its own terms, it is definitely worth the viewing, but I was a little underwhelmed considering the talent involved.Great Expectations(1998) is certainly not a bad movie. It looks amazing, with gorgeous scenery and some of the best cinematography I've seen recently. The music is haunting and sweeping, complimenting the film wonderfully. The script has its frothy moments, but also moments of tension and wit. The supporting cast really help to carry the film, especially Anne Bancroft's haunting, deranged Mrs Dinsmoor and Robert DeNiro's caring criminal-type character in the name of Lustig.However, I wasn't as convinced by the leads. Ethan Hawke and Gwyneth Paltrow look handsome certainly and their chemistry is okay, but overall I did find Hawke too sensitive and Paltrow too shallow. The story is loose as anticipated but also a rather clichéd poor-to-rich sort of story with some elements of draggy pacing and preachy tone. Alfonso Cuaron's direction was stylish certainly but forgets to give the film much substance and if anybody is looking for any of the basic underlying themes of the book you won't find much here sadly.All in all, stunning and stylish visually with a great score and supporting cast but the direction I had mixed feelings about, the story is rather clichéd and doesn't have enough substance to make me forgive that and the two leads are unconvincing, in my opinion. 6/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"Far Exceeded My Expectations","Date":"17 April 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" I haven't read Charles Dickens's novel on which 'Great Expectations' is based thus I cannot comment on its accuracy. However, I was very pleasantly surprised by Alfonso Cuarón's which is an enchanting cinematic experience. It's visually mesmerizing thanks to the amazing sets and art direction and perhaps mostly to the stunning cinematography. Cuarón certainly has an eye for visuals and in my opinion, this is one of the finest examples of first-rate cinematography. I was especially drawn by the long shots.Then there's the wonderful soundtrack which contributes beautifully to the lyrical flow and the surreal feel the film creates. The sound effects and lighting are on par.In addition, the dialogues are eloquently written. A lot is said with a few words and the few words that are spoken are poetry. The pacing is smooth. There is not a single boring moment.'Great Expectations' reminds me that Ethan Hawk is one of the finest actors today and unlike many of his contemporaries, he manages to keep a low profile and let his work speak. His performance is transcendent, unaffected by the visuals. Chris Cooper is equally good good as Fin's guardian who loves him no matter what. Gwyneth Paltrow looks alluring (albeit a little too thin). Anne Bancroft is haunting. Robert de Niro is awesome.I didn't know that Cuaron was the director and I wasn't expecting much from a cinematic adaptation of a Dickens novel but I got far more than what I has expected. It's been a while since a film has so wholly engaged and involved me.

They are helped along by a strong supporting cast of Anne Bancroft (wonderfully eccentric as Ms. Nora Dinsmoor), Chris Cooper and Robert DiNero.The problem, however, is that in trying to fit a story as long and complicated as 'Great expectations' into a 90 minute movie you loose a lot of the development of the characters necessary to identify and have an emotional reaction to them.Rather than linger on these issues Alfonso Cuaron concentrated on the visual aspect of the movie and the result is a movie that is great to watch!

There's rarely a scene that doesn't feel heart-felt, either through how Cuaron directs his actors or how the camera moves about them (or, for better or worse, the way the music cues scenes). And in a way it's more ambitious than your standard romantic drama studio fare just by how he lets this world come alive - remembered as opposed to how it exactly happened by the hero Finn played as an adult by Ethan Hawke - through this character's coming-of-age.Sadly, I wish it had a little more focus on that, though that's not what Great Expectations the book is entirely known for (at least, by people like me, who haven't read the book yet). It is a love story, that Great First Heartbreaking Love Story kind, where it starts out as a childhood infatuation that has some class commentary (or rather, one is poor, and one is rich, it's not till later it's a little spelled out by the narration), and then into a full-blown love story when Finn is called to New York to be a Big Selling Painter. And he does paint, and we see his process, and we see how his heart comes rising up again (despite warning from Anne Bancroft, who has a deliciously bittersweet role as Paltrow's grandmother or guardian or other) only to be (spoiler, joke) come crashing down.The love story is still dopey, as it might be in any movie where we know the outcome, and yet I never minded it. On the contrary what Cuaron does is a) make Hawk and Paltrow likable characters in this broken bond where neither side really wins, and b) makes the characters around them so memorable. Even Hank Azaria gets his moments to show what he can do with a non-comedic character; when his character goes to Finn and asks him what he should do about the woman he loves (to a man who loves her very much as well) it's a deliciously good scene for how restrained it is as the camera doesn't cut from its long take. And of course De Niro, whose prisoner bookends the story and has a big twist (or revelation, what you like) near the end that gives the film a bigger dose of poignancy I wasn't expecting.It's a lush, gorgeously detailed film, where even a scene where a character runs through the rain in a romantically desperate flash is oddly touching if only for how it embraces how much it's going over-the-top (or dancing around the top like a fool). It's a filmmaker in love with big Hollywood filmmaking, and with an intensely personal perspective, able to mostly meld his own view with such a multi-million dollar production. It's far from any perfection, and the script sometimes goes too far via the narration (we get it, inner turmoil!), but it's lovable in the same way that Zeffirelli's Romeo & Juliet was it tries to find the truth, or the passion at least, in the conventions.

Despite its radical rethink of the story's milieu, the film remains relatively faithful to the plot (as far as I can recall), but all the characters come across as spectacularly dull and/or unlikeable, which in turn makes the film difficult to like.

First I really liked the adaptation. It had tempo, fresh ideas, good acting, interesting, contrasting settings such as the poor Florida neighborhood vs decaying McMansion, crazy old lady and posh niece, poor uneducated boy vs posh girl.I also like how the main actor paves his way through an atmosphere through a world which is filled with some impenetrable, inexplicable weirdness. It's not just Estella with her mind swings. The New York snobs are not really snobs, the bad guys are not really threatening (I'm talking about a final brief chasing scene in an empty subway here). Some people pay absurd amounts of money for throwaway sketches labeled art. And so on.Unfortunately there is the love story between Finn and Estella which takes precedence over the class issues and ascending the social ladder. Many other motifs from the novel still have been completely cut out, such as friendship details accompanying the Biddy, Wemmick and Magwitch characters.All in all, the dramaturgy still seems unfinished or over-engineered to me. I think the producers (or whoever) decided to emphasize the love-story ... maybe for commercial reasons.One reviewer said there's a big hole in the middle in this film. I think there are many little holes. It is a big bowl which the filmmaking team really filled up to the rim with great ingredients but then it just leaks like a sieve, until, at the end there is not much left. But it is still something.I still want to read Dickens' novel. Maybe next year, as 2012 is just around the corner.

Finn is then hired as, well, a kind of playmate for ten-year-old Estella in the rotting old mansion of dotty old Mrs. Dinsmoor (Anne Bancroft). The years go by and Estelle (Gwyneth Paltrow) comes on to the now masculine and fully glandular Finn (Ethan Hawke), then turns away and leaves him flat.Out of nowhere, a lawyer shows up with a good deal of money for Finn to go to New York and establish his bona fides as an artist. In New York he encounters the nubile Estella again but after a strenuous turn in the sack she leaves him again for another man.The bitter Finn cuts a social swath through the New York art world, and a financial one too. His first gallery showing sells out. I don't personally begrudge Finn his success, although his sketches look like slightly off-angled portraits that would be thoroughly at home in a New Yorker advertisement for a commercial brokerage firm. When he sketches the scrunchible Paltrow nude, his so-called portrait is all scarlet nipples and black pudendum. (Not that there's any real nudity, alas.) No, I don't begrudge him. Not even though my own work was easily as good as his. It's true. Ask anybody. Ask my mother.Where was I? A little divagation there. Anyway, Finn turns into a snob, finds out who his benefactor is, grows into a Mensch, and goes home to that cozy dump in Floriday where his unpretentious and honest brother-in-law Chris Cooper greets him warmly and invites him in for a croaker dinner. Guess who also returns to the little village, chastened by her experiences in high society.The movie wants to be an erotic and atmospheric romance, and to hell with Charles Dickens. The novel is no more than a peg to hang the story on. Good-bye any pretense of social comment. And farewell to typical British names. All Brits have names like Percy Vetch and Doris Buckle. Yanks have good, strong, forthright names like Hiram Y. Bomboost and Choo Choo La Fevre. Come to think of it, British sandwiches are too thin. You can NOT get a decent pizza at four in the morning in John o' Groats. And they whisper over dinner instead of screaming and throwing the canolli at one another like civilized people. I have no idea why Miss Haversham of the novel became Ms. Dinsmoor in this movie or why her character has been changed from that of a bitter old maid to a colorful, gay eccentric. The closest we get to Dickens is a scene in the New York gallery that is invaded by the loud, hearty, gauche Chris Cooper, newly flown in from Florida to witness Finn's success. The scene is one of the best in the movie, even if overdrawn -- Chris Cooper as earthy life force versus the effete aesthetes. Another fine scene involves a visit Finn's benefactor makes in New York. Very nicely done by the actors and a good shot by the director -- during a tense moment on the subway an empty booze bottle rolls across the floor towards the camera. That the same shot is repeated a moment later is evidence of excess.I should mention the photography, production design, and set dressing too. They're all magnificent. Miss Dinsmoor's mansion is one of those high-ceilinged monstrosities, the interiors of which are festooned with Spanish moss and vines that look as old as the mansion itself. Even Finn's home, which he describes as poor, is colorful, spacious, and decorous. There are shots -- about four in succession -- of Finn and Estella walking across the bridges of Central Park on a fine autumn day, just as pretty as picture postcards though not suggestive of any reality you or I are likely to experience.I couldn't get with the score. Dramatic moments in Florida -- including a neat one of Estella silently inviting Finn to slip his hand up her thigh -- are backed by loud electronic guitars and a singer going OOOO OOOO. Not authentic Smithkicker music but obviously something composed for the film. Dramatic moments in New York offer operatic singers and fulsome orchestration. Under the closing credits, I was certain the theme had been lifted from Emanuelle. Gwyneth Paltrow illustrates her range as an actress. The snooty femme fatale is a little over her head. She was very impressive as the winsome, uncertain victim in Seven. Two old pros -- Robert DeNiro and the late Anne Bancroft -- turn in the best performances. Happily they were able to overcome or slough off the corny dialog We are what we are. And It's as if the past had never been. And I saw the light in her eyes. I'll tell it to you not as it was, but as I remember it. One scene towards the end is emblematic of the whole. Finn, crowned with success, is trying to find his brother-in-law on the streets of the city. He runs through a drenching downpour erratically, aiming nowhere. It's a scene that means to be full of impact but it means nothing. Just a guy running through a heavy rain. If somebody has to do it, give me Gene Kelly. I don't mean that there's anything offensive about the movie. It doesn't carry enough weight to be offensive. Everything is so pretty. "},{"Title":"space narrative","Date":"30 May 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" This film was directed by one o the most interesting visual minds we have working today. Cuarón knows how to work space, he knows how to move around, he knows how to find or/and create spaces that he can explore, moving around them, find the best view points. In these matters, he probably inherits Orson Welles' investigations of the days he mastered space exploration and architecture framing. That's where Cuarón's mind is centered, i think. Whereas Wenders explores in a pure way bi dimensional images, where Kubrick molds films around narrative constructions, Cuarón does it with space.Having said this, this specific film is not where he does it the more intensely. I didn't watch this when it came out, and now that i've seen it i've already seen Children of Men and the 3rd Harry Potter. Here he probably was more constrained and had less latitude to work his abilities. Yet there are moments, attached to spaces, which are pure visual pearls. So, work your mind in the scenes of the Lost Paradise house. Watch how that space is built to be explored, how big rooms exist to make it worthy for the camera to dance with the characters. Watch how the stairway which goes down to the fountain of the first kiss is there to allow the camera to follow characters as a pretext to exploit space. These moments in the stairway are specially Wellesian. The other space explored is the Hawke's studio in New York. The space is clear and not mysterious in the way we read it. In other words, you perceive it with a single frame, it is opened, and its composition is perfectly readable. But it is very interesting, the lighting and scale, and Cuarón uses it perfectly. I'm guessing this space is real, where the Lost Paradise is a set.These moments, which clearly were the most impressive in the film, to me, hang on a story. Borrowed from Dickens, the story has to do with the story itself. Characters exist are manipulators or manipulated (or both, in the case of Paltrow's character). It's a story about who is telling the story. At least in the cinematic construction (not the book's), characters exist to serve narrative construction, and i personally think that it is more effective, in cinema, that it goes like that. So we have to main narrators, but we are only aware of one, so is Hawke. That's the trick, it's clever and it certainly is effective, at least here.I don't like Ethan Hawke, i admit. I think he is untalented and, worse, he is arrogant in his performances. This means that he does nothing, but truly believes he is giving us something everlasting. Well, usually i'm put away from such performances (in the line of Freeman, Redford, latest Cruise...) but here, considering what his character does in the story, i have to admit he is a perfect cast. Gwyneth Paltrow is concentrated, intelligent, and it seems to me that she works hard to integrate her characters, but her work is invisible in the final product. And that's great...My opinion 4/5http//www.7eyes.wordpress.com "},{"Title":"Visually appealing","Date":"9 July 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" A modern take (but I hear unfaithful) on Charles Dickens' novel of the same name is a film that held me until the end.

There's no denying the appearance of the film is of sheer, carefully mastered artistry by the respectfully talented cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. Alfonso Cuaron gets the props for creating a dream-like environment in the earlier moments of the film which I thought were the most potent and my favorite, whereas the latter half dealt with adulthood it was understandable for the environment to change as well yet maintaining the same touch in a different manner. Cuaron's directing especially got to me when he demonstrated the lives of the higher class snobs and Hawke's character who served as a polar opposite. Cuaron also does this with the color of green and other opposite colors throughout the film. Beyond the fascades, there is a thematic and touching film, if you can connect to it on a personal level. It's not just a film about love, it's also a film about the loss of innocence and values, a celebration of youth and memories.

With exceptional camera-work and cinematography (Watch out for the long take in one of the gallery scenes), and even more quirkiness in the way he photographs this celluloid adaptation of the classic novel. Set in modern times, this no doubt has the newly acquired hostility, perhaps callousness and cynicism of our generation, but perhaps it is the feeling of desire, hoping, longing, ambition and infatuation that transcend any era. Hawke is a great performer in here, and so is Academy Award Winner Palthrow, who plays the seductive, volatile Estella whose only character arc manifests in the last scene. Fear not, for I haven't spoiled anything. De Niro is also terrific as the eccentric escapee/ex-convict, with a touching, maybe even shocking twist and revelation involving his character.Again, while undoubtedly may be an infidelic rendition to the Charles Dickens classic, of that I am unaware of (maybe even fortunately) because I was able to appreciate the beautiful, titillating rendition of the plot, or maybe the mere seed of an idea that came from the English author into the bigscreen.

This is the first filmed version I've seen since I read it(and before that, the only one I'd seen is the South Park episode which spoofs the famous story). I haven't read much of Dickens' work, but what I have read, I've thoroughly enjoyed and liked. I recall several key-points of the book. I remember the themes to it. I even remember words used to describe characters and locations... and I must say, this couldn't have done much better in capturing and updating it all. The essence of the novel is still there... it is a timeless classic, and in updating it(as well as moving it to the States), the story will reach a wider audience, something Charles' magnificent novel most certainly deserves. I recently saw a very promising trailer for Alfonso Cuarón's upcoming effort, Children of Men, and I've heard many good things about And Your Mother, Too(original title Y tu mamá también), so when this aired on TV and I saw his name here on IMDb, credited as director, I immediately decided to go ahead and check it out. I was gripped from the first minute of it. The plot is great. It follows the ideas and story-telling style quite nicely. The pacing is mostly great, though I felt it left something to be desired for some of the latter half of the film(that, along with a few other(mostly minor) problems is all that brings the rating down from an 8)... the film seemed to lose momentum, somehow. The acting is top-notch, all-round. I've never considered Paltrow that good an actress, but I must say, she portrayed Estella to perfection. Hawke and De Niro give in their usual solid performance. Azaria handles the first dramatic role I've seen him in with high marks. Bancroft pulls off a haunting performance that will stay with me for a long time. Cooper does an excellent job as Uncle Joe... I can't imagine the role being done any better. The direction is masterful. The editing is incredibly effective(though there was one or two moments in the film where it felt off). Cinematography is simply breathtaking. The visual side of this is definitely the best thing about the film. I'd say that it's worth watching just for that, for real film lovers.

The modernization aspect works surprisingly well here, staying very true to the characters and spirit of the original story while retelling it in a fashion more accessible by modern audiences. He also considerably amps up certain elements of the story to add to the entertainment value, especially playing up the romance aspect. Yet fortunately enough, for all the focus on romance here (and be warned, there are some very steamy scenes between Paltrow and Hawke) it only adds to the movie rather than suffocating it, and fear not, Great Exectations never falls into the dreaded chick flick style film-making - it still provides an interesting and compelling story to back up the romance element. There are some compelling and thought provoking themes here, especially with Finn confronting the drastic change between his humble past and his new, exciting present, and at which point in his life he was ultimately happier. There's also some beautiful cinematography, highlighting the exotic story locations, and even making Finn's underprivileged sea-side beginnings seem beautiful and desirable.Cuarón is also a success in extracting great performances out of his cast. Hawke is competent enough as lead character Finn, bringing more life to his character during scenes where he is less contained, able to shout about his feelings to the world. Paltrow is excellent as haughty ice queen Estella, the constant object of Finn's affections. She brings a sensual edge to the bored and impulsive character that has never been seen in previous adaptations of the story. The two are backed up by a highly capable supporting cast, where most of the movie's most impressive performances come to play, with Chris Cooper, Ann Bancroft, Hank Azaria and Robert De Niro all giving excellent performances. Cooper brings a fiery life to Finn's rough yet lovable Uncle Joe. (the scene where he confronts Finn in his new environment, bringing a distinct clash to the upper crust New Yorkers is perhaps the most powerful in the movie) Bancroft is terrifically over the top as Estella's insane adoptive mother, and the always under-appreciated Azaria is great as Finn's rival for Estella's affections. Yet it's De Niro who, as always, is the highlight, just about walking away with the picture in a brief yet powerful appearance. The way he manages to make such a memorable character and give such a wonderful performance out of, what could have been a catastrophe in the hands of a different actor shows how immensely talented an actor he is. Purists of the novel may not be entirely happy with certain adaptations made to make the story more appropriate for today's audiences, yet I found they worked very well. It's particularly impressive how Cuarón avoids turning the story into strictly a love story, but balances the romance aspect with capable storytelling in the forefront. A solid piece of work overall, punctuated by excellent performances, and Great Expectations is certainly a worthy retelling of the classic novel.-7/10 "},{"Title":"A worthwhile picture","Date":"15 December 2005","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Much like the modern-day rendition of Romeo and Juliet redone by Gabrielle Martinelli, Great Expectations allows us to encapsulate Fin's (Pip in the original) hopeless obsession with Estella (Gwenyth Paltrow), and Estella's constant denial of her own feelings. This film places the twentieth century novel in modern-time by replacing names, intent, and plot but nonetheless, manages to focus on Fin's unending obsession with Estella Dinsmore. Despite the deviations from the novel, I find that Great Expectations does more for those hopeless romantics out there than any other film. More notably the scene when Fin, in a drunken stupor, professes his love for Estella outside the mansion... Beautiful.

The merit I admire most of all is the careful cogitation about which features of Dickens's novel should be retained and which ones should be changed. Evidently, it would have been foolish to retain Estella's biological kinship according to the novel, or to preserve the benefactor's aim about the boy. But many other alterations are not self-evident. In the novel and likewise in David Lean's movie of 1946, the man who is planned to marry Estella is arrogant rather than jealous. And this emotion derives primarily from his expectations about Estella's inheritance. His counterpart in Cuarón's new version, Walter, could hardly have been less jealous (nor is he arrogant). Walter is played by Hank Azaria, who might well have deserved an Oscar for best performance in a supporting role. - Many people who read the novel or saw Lean's movie without having any advance knowledge may during most of the book or movie be in doubt as to whether the criminal or the rich lady is the secret benefactor. However, Cuarón was faced with the problem that some spectators might already have read or seen Dickens or Lean, or both. Some might even know that Dickens never introduces a person for 'a brief visit' in the beginning of a novel, unless this person will toward the end turn out to have a key position. How do Cuarón and his credit writer Mitch Glazer manage to retain such doubt in these spectators? After his escape the old gangster is caught and returned to the prison, where he is scheduled to be executed very soon. It is improbable that a convict with a death sentence could escape twice. Hence, the new version might include the radical innovation that the rich lady was indeed the benefactor. (I, for one, was never deceived). - - - The virtue to which I give the second place is Patrick Doyle's music. It is my honest conviction that we must go back to the 1960s and 1950s to find even one movie with music of a comparable beauty and congenial character. A few examples 'The lady with the dog', 'The cranes are flying', 'Last year in Marienbad', 'Muriel ou le temps d'un retour', 'Phaedra', 'Repulsion', 'A taste of honey', 'Asphalt Jungle', 'Miss Julie', 'Cybèle ou les dimanches de Ville d'Avray'. - - - I will not be able to rank all other virtues of the movie. But it is a fact that during the four months it was shown in the cinema in Stockholm I saw it 15 times. I may subsequently have seen it as many times on video, laser, or DVD. Probably I have not seen David Lean's version more than four times during 50 years. The local film reviewers of dailies had promised that Cuarón's movie had few positive qualities except beautiful pictures which may be more suitable for a commercial. Now, I have no great admiration of this profession, and I perceived genuine qualities almost from the beginning. But the first scene to overwhelm me as really great was the sequence when the children kiss each other. Cuarón applies a number of photographic and other devices, all of them adequate for achieving his purpose. During this sequence I felt However poor the rest of the movie may be, this scene alone will justify the inclusion of the entire film among significant movies. I never got the chance to test my thought because the subsequent movie was far from poor. - - - Other scenes or sequences that have spoken directly to my heart are, foremost, Estella's first visit in Finn's room; every detail of the long and heterogeneous sequence from the moment Estella tells Finn that Walter had asked her to marry him, and until Estella and Finn sleep with each other; and the scene when the rich lady tells Finn that Estella had just married Walter. - - - I imagine I have detected all physical errors of the movie (e.g., at the club Walter performs a quite different task without moving his lips, while his voice tells the story of the artist and the dog). But I do not think that they retract from the value of the movie. There is one more shortcoming I am also prepared to excuse. Alfonso Cuarón is evidently highly skilled in person directing. But if I may say so, Ethan Hawke has profited less than the others from Cuarón's skill. - - - A final word I know of no other instance in which so many works of art have been produced specifically for one certain movie.

The first was in the theater in early 1998 (I really enjoyed it, although, I admit I didn't pay that close of attention to it...I pretty much just enjoyed the visuals without ever getting a feel for the story.) The second time was on video last summer. After the second screening, I thought it was really quite a miserable film. Contrived, corny, and unbelievable, with bad performances from both Ethan Hawke and Gwyneth Paltrow to boot; although, still I recognized it as a visual gem. Then, I began reading the original Dickens novel early this year. And I thought, Well, now that I truly understand the story and the character's motivations, maybe I should pick it up again and give it another chance. I have just finished watching Great Expectations for the third, and most likely final, time. Overall, as you may guess, I have extremely mixed feelings about it. The script was extraordinarily disappointing. The characters were drawn so weakly that it was hard to really get anything from the story and, alas, I understand where the poor performance from Ms. Paltrow came from. Aesthetically, yes, this is one of the most visually decadent, artistic, incredibly beautiful films I have ever seen. The cinematography and art direction (both in extraordinary shades of green) are marvelous. These are the qualities which make the film worth watching and I suppose if you're a sucker for ham-fisted romance, the story will suit your purposes very nicely. The drama or realism never cuts skin deep, instead we are drowned in ridiculous, flight romanticism. Charles Dickens' novel is chopped into pieces, none of the gritty manipulation or character depth is included and hardly even mentioned (in tiring voice-overs by a wooden Ethan Hawke.) Luckily, though, the film does feature two incredible performances from both Anne Bancroft and Robert De Niro (both in supporting roles, stealing every scene from their younger cohorts.) If only the visual splendor had been fused together with the wonderfully brutal depth of the novel, we would have had one of the most brilliant film adaptations of all-time...well, this isn't. I do urge you to rent it (if only to see a very hot-looking Gwyneth in the nude) for the beautiful visual style and the possibility that it might peak your interested in Dickens' original novel. So, I guess the best way to describe this one is...Uh, not quite...even this, though (all visual style included), is quite an understatement for how unbearable and disheartening the final scene is. Just leave before the last five minutes and come back to watch the incredible art-work show with the ending credits ;).

From what I can remember Estella was a lady with some relationship disorder and was quite unpredictable, not fun at all. Rather like a suspense thriller, cuz I didn't read the book so I didn't know how the story would turn out. Like I keep asking will they get together or what. Now the second time round Estella is much more straight forward, from her espressions I can read how she was on the verge of deciding one way or the other. Off course, I am talking about Paltrow's portrayal of Estella here. Much more fun to watch the second time round. Very sweet story and a heart-warming ending.By merit of good acting, cinemagraphy and pace this film should be in the top 250 I think. It's good movie. I am giving it high mark to immortalise it.

How could it be?  Nor is it that it's unfaithful to the book.  Any book transferred to the screen is bound to be altered somehow, and there are many perfectly legitimate kinds of alterations.  It's okay to simplify the plot so that it will fit into a smaller space (so long as the simplified plot makes sense in its own right).  It's okay to change the setting (so long as THAT works in its own right).  It's okay to be mocking; it's okay to turn tragedy into satire; it's okay to make the ostensible hero into a villain - I can't think of a single change that would not, in some circumstances, be okay.  What's unforgivable is to make changes and yet keep the original book, or the structure of the original book, as scaffolding.Anyone who's read Great Expectations will find this film a trying experience.  Characters' circumstances have been changed, yet they act just the way their counterparts act in the novel - simply BECAUSE their counterparts act that way in the novel.  If I were to judge the film on its own merits ... but I can't; that's the problem.  If you've read the book you will be unable to make much sense of the film except as a grotesquely distorted copy of an abridged version of the novel.  The effort to see it as anything else is beyond me.For proof that this needn't have been the case, consider Clueless.  Jane Austen's novel Emma is set around the same time as Dickens's (although it's contemporary, whereas Dickens is looking back some distance into the past), and both novels resist transposition into the twentieth century for much the same reason - both novels rely heavily, albeit in very different ways, on class-consciousness.  I won't go into everything Amy Heckerling did right and Alfonso Cuarón did wrong.  I don't have room.  The main difference is that Heckerling updated Emma by finding good twentieth-century analogues to the elements of Austen's story; AND, if she couldn't find them, she coolly changed the story.  The result is something that people who have read Emma (as well as people who haven't) can judge Clueless as a separate work, ignoring questions of fidelity altogether.  Not so Cuarón's Great Expectations.  It ONLY makes sense as a cinematic translation of a novel by Charles Dickens - and on those terms, it's not very good.On any terms, I can't help thinking that the central character Finn (the fuzzy shadow of Pip) is a failure.  He comes across as just too much of a jerk.  And Finn's voice-over, unlike Pip's narration, wasn't written by Dickens - part of the reason why it has no particular merit and contributes nothing.

For me, the early portion of the movie, set in Florida, is the most effective. The shore and sea sequences are atmospheric, and Robert de Niro is appropriately nasty as Lustig - though his first encounter with Finn has far less impact than its memorable equivalent in David Lean's 1946 version.  The scenes in the crumbling old mansion of Miss Havisham/Ms Dinsmore - played by Anne Bancroft as more eccentric than crazed - are aptly reminiscent of Tennessee Williams.   However, the film begins to fall to pieces when Ethan Hawke and Gwyneth Paltrow take over as adult Finn and Estella, partly because of inadequacies in their portrayals, but mainly because credibly updating the book is beyond the ingenuity of the film-makers. Finn moves to New York, and quickly gains celebrity as an artist, although the paintings we see are rather feeble - despite (or because of) Estella posing nude for him, before she departs to marry another man. Also feeble, unfortunately, is a bearded de Niro in his later scenes with Hawke. The final portion of the story, culminating with Finn being reunited with Estella, is told largely via voice-over. To end on a positive note, Chris Cooper is excellent thoughout as Finn's amiable, plain-speaking Uncle Joe (the book's Joe Gargery).

It first takes place in sunny Florida in the '60s,  where ten year old Finn Bell (I suppose the name of Pip was just too silly and juvenile) lives with his sis and her husband (Chris Cooper).  Finn has been blessed with a natural gift for drawing and sketching.  One day that gift may make him a rich man,  but for now,  the family is poor and when the crazy old lady Ms. Dinsmoor (And what was the matter with the name of Havisham???) asks that Finn come over and entertain her and her (niece???) Estella,  there is no hesitation.  Finn falls head over heels for little Estella, who is beautiful but has an icy stare.  The years pass,  and Finn's (Ethan Hawke) love for Estella (Gwyneth Paltrow) continues unchanged while she performs double duty as an ultra-bitch not only is she a first class snot,  but she teases him relentlessly with her sexuality and keeps no promises.  The crazy old biddy Ms. Dinsmoor (Anne Bancroft) has raised Estella to be cruel to all men because some schmo left her at the alter back in nineteen-ot-something and relishes the hurt Estella heaps onto Finn.  When Estella skips town without even saying goodbye,  Finn is so broken that he abandons his wonderful drawing.   Years later,  a New York art dealer shows up at Finn's door promising that his talent will make him a success.  So off to NY Finn goes,  where he encounters the beautiful,  chilly Estella once again.  I found that Paltrow did a great job at being icy,  snotty and bitchy.  In contrast,  Hawke transformed Finn into a lovely,  sweet,  vulnerable presence.  I wondered why such a handsome,  intelligent and talented man would give such a cold fish as Estella the time of day.

The themes of the book fall through the cracks- the prodigal son idea is totally lost in favor of a love story between Pip (renamed Finn for no good reason) and Estella.  Estella is unevenly characterized, at times she is as heartless as she is in the book, but usually it seems we are supposed to like her , and want Pip to win her.  I suppose it is impossible in Hollywood today to have a female lead who is unworthy of love. The other characters are also unrecognizable... Joe and Pip are not ever the best of friends but they barely spoke. (which makes the scene where pip is embarrassed by Joe so much less poignant).  Mrs. Joe doesn't beat anyone, she apparently just sleeps around.  These changes cheapen the drama significantly.

Avoid it at all costs, unless you enjoy films where one of the greatest literary characters of all time is reduced to a pretentious Greenwich Village beatnik who spouts dialogue ripped off from Bryan Adams songs (Everything I do, I do it for you!!).

The storytelling resonated so intensely with childhood memories and emotions, the effects were intoxicating. The opening line sets the stage for you to be taken back through your own experiences I'm not going to tell the story the way it happened. I'm going to tell it the way I remember it. However, one of the critical scenes was just absolutely butchered preventing the movie from being great or considered a classic. The first few scenes do a great job of reminding you of your childhood and the excitement of those fun adventures you had. Maybe you were only a few blocks from your house, but you and your friends considered your adventures grand nonetheless. Of course Finn's 'adventure' is a bit more dramatic than anything anyone would care to have their child experience, the danger and mystery it represents rekindles those memories.The basic plot is a standard, blue collar kid (Finn played by Hawke) falls in love with socialite (Estella played by Paltrow). Finn meets his love under unusual circumstances which continues to haunt him throughout the film. While he greatly appreciates anytime he spends with her, its revealed that she not 'slumming it' as a distraction, shes sharpening her 'heart-breaking' skills. This adds additional drama for the audience since Finn obviously is unaware of this treachery. Yes the general premise of unrequited teenage love is not new and it is a bit predictable. However, the way it is portrayed in this film is something you will be hard pressed to find in any other film with a similar plot. This story is typically presented in some low budget B-movie with poor acting, cinematography, and blunt sophomoric humor to keep the script from dragging to badly. Alfonso Cuarón's creation is well put together with pleasing visuals and great acting that stirs emotions instead of reminding of our own analogous experiences.The intensity of bedroom scene gets you to question if Estellas 'training' will hold up or is she falling for him. This stirred the powerful and narcotic memories of those intense adolescent crushs. The aftermath of this scene is portrayed in a believable fashion that allows the audience to continue floating through the memories of the rebound.The hole comes in the taxi cab scene after Estella visits Finn. Instead of setting up a dramatic climax, it deflates the tension. The scene seems so poorly written or directed I just wince watching it. Tell him a lie, play coy, continue to tease him along, do something other than how the script is written here (yuck!!!). Shes being honest, but the dialogue seemed forced and is so unbelievable it forces you to admit your watching a movie and not in your minds eye any longer.The script doesn't seem up to par in the couple scenes following this, but its hard to know if its just a hangover from the previous scene or just forced advancement to the climax. Ms. Dinsmore (Bancroft) delivers the coup de grace to Finn and its all over. There's an intriguing sequence after this, but it doesn't really advance the movie but it would seem incomplete without. The conclusion is a bit open ended and I wonder how it would have been if it ended without this scene.Anyway the ability of this movie to make the audience feel those raw and innocent emotions of our childhoods is what makes this movie worth the watch. Flaws and all I'll watch frequently and listen to the soundtrack several times a month.

That was precisely the problem I had in the movie.  Great Expectations, like Great Gatsby, is about a poor boy obsessed with a golden daughter of privilege confronted by huge class barriers (What does he really love ?  The girl or through her being accepted into her class ?).  Pip, like Jay Gatsby, can never truly believe that he is good enough for her because he is not her social equal.  He is not to the manner born.  Jay Gatsby can invent a fictitious old sport persona and imitate the mannerisms of the old money rich to infiltrate Daisy's world but he knows it is a fraud.  Pip knows that Drummond is part of Estella's world in a way he will never be because he WAS to the manner born.  This doesn't play in 1998.  Outside of Newport and the Hamptons there is no real distinction between new and old money.

I saw the advertisements, that only showed the best scenes from the film, as the fountains-scenes, and in a very beautiful back-music. With so much expectations, I watched the film always thinking that something better would happen in the future and I didn't noticed how bad the film was. But the 2nd time I watched it I saw how slow and boring was the film. Gwyneth Paltrow's character wasn't human in my opinion, but a robot. She was always with the same voice, face and Ethan Hawke could smile, talk, scream, kill her, but she was always with the same face. All the movie is very slow and repetitive. But I still recommend it, although you can laugh a little with Estella (Paltrow), because it's better than the movies we usually see on TV, but only once. If you watch it twice, maybe you will hate.

And wasn't it brilliant.Alfonso Cuaron has tried to give this version of Great Expectations the same kind of approach, but unfortunately it is not done as well.It fails because while bringing the story up to date, they have lost much of the plot, they have tried to hide the fact that it is Dickens by renaming half the cast, and the actors give mostly uninspiring performances - okay, Anne Bancroft is good (if over the top in her nuttiness).But De Niro - again - turns in a performance devoid of any character. It's simply De Niro, this time with a beard. But you don't see any characterisation. Ethan Hawke is out of his depth. Gwyneth Paltrow is good, though too frosty to be believable. Chris Cooper is cliched. The younger actors are quite good.The set design is very good - the house especially, and the nice metaphorical touch of the roof having caved in later in the movie, when Finn (or Pip)'s life has also 'caved in'. The musical touches are good too.But the script is naff. They have lost the magic in trying to update it, and as such I find it difficult to recommend (score 5).

The only part that stands out is the cinematography, but even that felt contrived. What would be gorgeous theatrical sets seemed unnatural, though the designers really tried to have a Dickensian feel. The mansion was my least favourite part...it just didn't feel real (especially the decor). It was trying to hard to be rich, old, rundown, eccentric and fascinating all at the same time. Overdone in all respects. The story here was skeletal. While the writers obviously tried to inject enough Dickens to maintain the story's dignity, while adding enough Hollywood and melodrama to satisfy the viewers and enough modernization to allow those clueless to its past to still enjoy the film, the result was too much hodgepodge. It was oversaturated and much too diluted. The acting was subpar and the characterization much too sappy. Ethan Hawke was awkward and cardboard, and Gwyneth Paltrow (who *really* needs to gain a few pounds, especially if she keeps wearing those loose, hanging dresses...) was one-dimensional and her character was excessively vague. Even De Niro seemed out of place...his acting was much too high for such a low-body role. The only real standout was Anne Bancroft, and even she seemed to be trying too hard. This film simply felt like a movie-of-the-week, with the sappy Danielle Steele back-lighting and cheezy melodramatic music to go with the heart-string tugging scenes.Lacking in transition, and missing many of the core elements that made the novel so wonderful, this film's potential far outweighed the outcome. It tried much too hard and ended up second-rate. 4/10.

In fact, I am in the play currently as the character of Mrs. Joe Gargery, so maybe I'm a little biased.They completely ruined each character except for Pip..I mean Fin and Estella. They modernized them but they didn't modernize any other characters. Well, they modernized them but they had nothing to do with the original characters. Ms. Nora Dinsmoor is a prime example of this. In the original, Miss Havisham always wore her wedding dress, kept things from her wedding around, and in this new version they don't even mention a wedding.I personally think Charles Dickens would be insulted.

The story moves along at a good pace, that's also good. There's a passable soundtrack which complements the scenes. There are a lot of good actors and actresses here. But the script doesn't even remotely capture the essence or even the feeling of the book. I read the book nearly 15 years ago. Everything just seemed all wrong, despite the changes of modernity and society and culture.You can transplant a story from one continent to another and you must change the geography and language, that's fine. Transport it over 100 years into the future, so phrases and jobs and settings need to change, again it's expected. You have to condense a story which might take 15 hours to read into about 90 minutes. A lot of the material gets butchered and rehashed, eh, OK. But you take what little is left over, and change it so that it emphasizes Gweneth Paltrow's bust line, lips and hips, and you've cheapened a classic in order to make a quick buck. It's typical Hollywood pimps sending the women and guys out to turn tricks.She's OK looking, but she's not all that. Ethan Hawke really delivers on the tortured soul bit, but it's all disjointed, out of context, and doesn't have much explained, not consistent with itself, and not even close to the story. The book was about so many different topics, and they were tied together cohesively, and left one feeling fulfilled and enriched after reading. This movie will leave the intelligent person with a dull, tinny* echo of that effect. Kind of like a mental laxative, it passes through your brain quickly and leaves little of itself left inside you, leaving you feel a bit hollow.*Tinny, not tiny, as in tapping together two empty tin cans makes a tinny ching clank chink sound.Now, if this were a movie until itself, not based upon *cough* *inspired by* *cough* *latch on to author's classically acclaimed success* I wouldn't be as generous, because it's just kind of crappy, dull and boring. The ending in the movie doesn't make much sense. The ending is very rushed, not in terms of scenes, but in terms of dialog. They spend a lot of time running around without talking, when they should have been talking to drive home some of the points the movie was trying to emphasize. Oh wait, that's assuming it had any point.If you enjoy watching actors and actresses being blatantly prostituted, don't have the brain capacity to digest a hearty meal for mind and spirit, prefer stylism over substance, then maybe this movie is for you.
