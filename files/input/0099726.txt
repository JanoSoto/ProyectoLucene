[{"Title":"To Define True Madness, What Is't But To Be Nothing Else But Mad?","Date":"2 November 2004","Score":"61 out of 72 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" I'd put off viewing this version of Hamlet for a long time, because I'd heard that they'd turned this most cerebral of plays into an action movie, but I ended up quite liking it.I should begin by saying that I approve of ALL interpretations, because each choice reflects different possibilities all of which are supportable by the text; no one vision can encompass every potentiality inherent in the play. And the text per se, of course, will always exist in absolute form despite the number of hands that manipulate it.All productions (except Branagh's) cut certain elements as a sacrifice to tighter (though narrower) focus. And the use of film rather than stage allows (even necessitates) different types of dramatic development. Films unfold at a different pace than stage plays. Zefirelli's adaptations WORK as film-making, without detracting from (or unnecessarily supplementing) Shakespeare's language. For instance, the little prologue scene showing the internment of the dead king. It is original to the movie, and yet the dialogue is still from the play; it doesn't misrepresent anything about the characters in its new context. And perhaps most importantly, it works in the movie that the director is making. But on to the substantive comment...Mel Gibson was, in my opinion, too old to be Hamlet (making Glenn Close, by extension, too young to be Gertrude), but the issue of Hamlet's age has always been a problem. He's 30 in the text (this version leaves out that calculation), but that makes some of his relationships (with Ophelia, for instance) seem a little... immature. And yet if he's portrayed too young, his depth of thought is almost impossibly precocious. But I thought he was convincing nonetheless, particularly in expressing something that I've found central to my understanding of the play but I all too rarely see dealt with in Hamlet's portrayal, which is thisHamlet IS quite mad. 'Tis true 'tis true 'tis pity, and pity 'tis 'tis true. From his first meeting with the ghost onwards, he is profoundly disturbed. It is irony that he then puts an 'antic disposition' on, because he has in actuality gone quite 'round the bend.Mel Gibson not only gives the first convincing portrayal of Hamlet's pretended madness that I've seen, but he also shows us the desperation of the character in his quiet moments. Hamlet is not, as Olivier posited in his 1948 version, merely a man who could not make up his mind. Gibson's Hamlet spends much of the film alternating between mania-induced impulsiveness and paralyzing inability to act. The Dane is not merely melancholy, he is certifiably manic-depressive. (Claudius, I believe, sees this.)Over all, I believe that this would be a good introduction to the story of Hamlet for those who otherwise would have had no contact with it, although as I said it can then be supplemented by other adaptations (and of course there's no substitute for, ultimately, reading the text).

His performance brings tears to my eyes.Glenn Close is amazing; her motherly attitude and sincerity toward Hamlet is so much that one sometimes cannot feel anger towards her. Close gives life to Gertrude that no one has been able to before or after.

Her reaction to her father's death is so convincing and terribly sad that I cry at merely seeing her.The interpretation of the story is a perfect one that required surely a great amount of thought and reading of the very play. Zeferelli interprets it so well, that it flows like real life.

He lamented the film cut the 4 hour play in half and how it is more suited to the stage. He confessed it only seemed like he played Hamlet. But it was his portrayal of the confused Dane which made me respect him as an actor. I cared nothing for Mad Max or his previous work. Hamlet is a beautiful film. The grays and browns of the middle ages contrast nicely with the colorful Glenn Close as Gertrude. Hamlet was directed by Franco Zefferelli who did Romeo and Juliet 22 years earlier. I found this remarkable. We are told the themes of Hamlet are revenge, madness and procrastination. Its overwhelming concern is death in all its forms murder, suicide and natural causes. To be or not to be. In the graveyard, Hamlet contemplates the skull of a court jester he knew as a child. Shakespeare's greatest play asks life's biggest questions. Why must we die? What is the point of life if we must die? Is there life after death? Heaven? Hell? Biblical thinking pervades the play. There was little science in either mideval Denmark or Elizabethan England. Mel Gibson brought an energy to his role not seen before. His facial expressions show his mental state. Helena Bonham Carter renders a distracted Ophelia.

He has a fine sense of color and its movement. Moreover, this Hamlet has the very best set, and also to my mind the best Gertrude.What he has done is focus on the story. He's chopped and dropped and rearranged to create a story that makes sense. It moves and moves well from beginning to end. But.But the problem is that Shakespeare's play is not at all about the story. That's just the skeleton on which some life altering metaphoric structure is built. Now all gone.

There are various interpretations of each character and the story; however, no one vision can adequately encompass every perspective of the play. The text, of course, will always exist in permanent form and it is up to the individual's interpretation to make the story their own. Zeffirelli did a terrific job at directing such a complex story into a film easily understood by viewers. In most translations from books to movies, producers sacrifice certain elements to narrow the focus and make the film unique to his style. The use of film techniques, compared to the Victorian stage plays, allows different dramatic developments in the story. Thus, the movie unfolds at a different pace than stage play, creating a whole new dynamic between scene transitioning. Christopher de Vore's skill as a screenwriter accurately portrays the characters without detracting from Shakespeare's language. For example, the prologue in the beginning of the movie demonstrates the enthrallment of Hamlet Senior as a ghost. Retaining the originality to the dialogue in the text, the movie is still unique to the director's vision. Most importantly, the director's interpretation of the story works well in developing the depth of each character without creating a new twist in the story of Hamlet. Although he cut some essential parts from the play, Zeffirelli employed his own style and created an amazing tribute to Shakespeare. He edited parts of the movie and rearranged it to create a story that would make sense to contemporary audiences. Through this, he gives in an apparent life to the play which moves well from beginning to end.Shakespeare's play is not at all about the story. The story is just the outer armor on which some life altering metaphoric structure is built around. For example, Hamlet Junior bellows, Tis true 'tis true 'tis pity, and pity 'tis true. From Hamlet Junior's first meeting with Hamlet Senior's ghost, he is profoundly disturbed and begins to question his mentality and judgment of reality. Ironically, he pretends to be crazy to conceal his true plans to kill his uncle Claudius. Zeffirelli has a fine sense of coloring in each scene with movement between light and dark, and good and evil. Zeffirelli focuses on the characters and allows them lead the storyline without compromising the text's originality. One complaint is that Mel Gibson seemed to be too old for the role of Hamlet, thereby making Glenn Close too young to be Gertrude. The issue of Hamlet's age has always been a problem. According to the text, he is supposed to be in his thirties; however, that makes some of his relationships with Ophelia, for instance, seem pedophiliac. Yet, if Hamlet is portrayed too young, the depth of his thought is almost impossible to imagine. I thought he was a good actor; particularly in reciting the Shakespearean lines is something I have found most important to my understanding of the story. His passion clearly portrays a son who has gone through madness over his father's death, contemplation of murdering his uncle, and the incestuous marriage of his mother. Gibson not only gives a convincing depiction of Hamlet's cloak of madness, but also shows us the desperation of the character in his quiet moments as Hamlet is not a man who could not make up his mind, but rather, one who riddled with uncertainty. Thus, Gibson spends much of the film alternating between mania-induced impulsiveness and paralyzing inability to function with sanity. Glenn Close is amazing as she portrays Gertrude as a real character, with traits both shameful and empathetic. Helena Bonham-Carter's performance is astounding as well, especially her moment of lunacy as Ophelia in reacting to the death of her father, Polonius. The cast of characters in this version of Hamlet was more than enough to bring Shakespeare's stage theater alive on screen. Overall, I believe that this is a good foundation to understanding the language of Hamlet further, and would be supplemented with the Shakespearean text. I commend Zeferelli as a master filmmaker for his directing skills. I would promote this acclaimed film to anyone who has ever marveled at Shakespearean language and would like to watch a film literature as well.

I love how clear and defined the film is, while still having the essence of Shakespeare's intent. The acting is so intense, yet believable. I love the interpretation of the era, and how the delivery of the lines made them so easy to grasp without losing the authenticity. The play is really long and repetitive, so I think this movie did a fantastic job of really getting the meat. In some other Shakespeare film adaptations I've seen the lines are stale and rehearsed, and it really shocks me that someone could accuse these actors of being out of touch with the dialog. I found it to be quite the opposite. So many of the scenes are just so juicy. They really capture the story's power and depth. Plus, I'm really into that period, so I found it difficult to get into Branagh's film, no matter how good it was, *and* I really can't stand to watch Kenneth Branaugh. He really irritates me because I feel like he uses this same set of annoying expressions for every couple phrases. Huge apologies to all those out there who worship him. It's just how I feel.

It dares us to look at the truth of our own mortality and at the same time consider right vs wrong.Branagh's choice was to present the entire play, Zefirelli chose to compress it for the screen. Each choice has its merits. I like Branagh's version too and I think it's a mistake to compare the 2 versions or add a comparison to Olivier either. Judge each on its own merits.Looking at this film, Mel Gibson is simply great. His Hamlet is obviously someone with a zest for life and a sense of humor who is completely stunned by the events at the opening of the film and thrown even more off kilter by his father's ghost. All I can say is, I love the way he plays it. The other players are excellent as well. I've never particularly liked Glenn Close's looks, but she's a great actress. Helena is my favorite Ophelia ever. And Alan Bates is superb.I've never quite accepted the theory that Hamlet can't make up his mind. Just reading the play one sees Hamlet go from a thirst for blood to messing around with a fencing match because Claudius placed a bet on it. How to explain this? What we are seeing is a bright, brilliant mind going through a nervous breakdown and then regaining sanity.You HAVE TO understand, too, that Hamlet can't just go stick a sword in his popular uncle and say his father's ghost told him to do it. Pay attention and it's clear that he needs more than just the word of the ghost and this limits his choices. After the visit from his father's ghost Hamlet seems to be not just feigning madness but literally out of his mind, he's not in control. Hamlet tells us that one reason not to commit suicide is that God has outlawed that choice. If Hamlet accepts that from God, how can he commit murder, even if his father's ghost tells him to? Hamlet's antic disposition at the Mousetrap is not an act. And Gibson's Hamlet really is off his rocker when he rails at his mother and accidentally kills Polonius. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are victims of this madness as well.The Hamlet who comes back from England isn't charging back to Denmark for revenge, is he? He hardly mentions it. To me, at this point Hamlet HAS made up his mind. He has resigned himself to the fact that he does not want to be a killer and he is going to take things a day at a time. Gibson plays it with this sense of resignation. He still has his intelligence and sense of humor, he's regained control of himself. He is swept into the duel with Laertes willy-nilly, there is no more strategy for killing the king. He's almost beginning to enjoy life again as the duel starts. He even tells Laertes that he was crazy when Polonius was killed and says it wasn't the real Hamlet who did that. It's not until Gertrude is poisoned and Laertes tells Hamlet he is doomed that he explodes with rage again and doubly kills Claudius. His father's murder isn't the reason for this act, it's rage at Claudius for the deaths of Getrude, Laertes, and Hamlet himself.Hamlet's fatal flaw isn't indecision, it's his humanity, intelligence, and his conscience. That's the human being that Shakespeare created and Gibson brings to life.

Its main virtues are a fine performance from Mel Gibson as Hamlet; a script that makes full use of the movie medium while giving Shakespeare sufficient scope to enrich and entertain us with his people and his words; two great performances from Alan Bates as Claudius and Paul Scofield as the Ghost; two good performances from Nathaniel Parker as Laertes and Glenn Close as Gertrude; and a fine music score from Ennio Morricone that anticipates and amplifies our emotions.First, my criticisms. In directing his actors, Franco Zefferelli makes two big mistakes, one interesting and one painful. The interesting mistake Ian Holm changes Polonius from a doddering old man to someone evil-minded and fully possessed of his wits. When this Polonius babbles about plays that are pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral he is being deliberately comic. One scene demonstrates the badness of this choice. We have no idea why this sharp-witted, not-very-old man is prating to the king and queen instead of coming to the point about Hamlet's madness. (Then again, Richard Briers gives us a smart Polonius in Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet, and there it worked.) The painful mistake Helena Bonham-Carter changes Ophelia from a meek victim to a strong-willed, independent-minded young woman. The director and actress probably thought they were being good little feminists, but the idea is psychologically and dramatically disastrous. Bonham-Carter's Ophelia could never go mad. And even if she could, her crass new self is no longer sharply contrasted with a meek former self. This Ophelia seems fully capable of being earthy and vulgar even before she loses her mind. This blunts the effect of the mad scenes which in themselves are beautifully presented and played.Now the praise. Gibson reads Shakespeare's words skillfully and is bettered in this regard only by Bates and Scofield; his readings convey the words' music and meaning at long last I understand the line, What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven. He also reveals one aspect of Hamlet that I see when I read the play. Hamlet is never more dangerous, or off-putting, than when he's clowning. The melancholy Hamlet attracts me and the joking Hamlet repels me. Gibson's Hamlet does the same.Shakespeare never suffers from the artful cutting and rearrangement of his text. This script is especially clever. Among many nice surprises was hearing Hamlet deliver his Get thee to a nunnery speech to Ophelia as they sit in the audience before the play. Even better are the dozens of little touches that only a movie can provide. I loved how the camera showed Hamlet and Polonius spy on scenes that in most productions take place out of their sights. But the script and direction are also a shade too restless. The camera shots and the scenery change rapidly as characters dart from one place to another. Once or twice the movie should have paused and let us luxuriate in the language. The perfect opportunity would have been the To be or not to be speech; but Gibson and Zefferelli make it a scene of high drama. I craved the usual Hamlet who stops and tells us what he thinks because he wants to overhear himself.The idea of Hamlet and Gertrude lusting for each other works surprisingly well. Most post-Freudian productions present this notion, but I don't think it's in the play. The interview in the bed chamber is Polonius' idea, not Hamlet's or Gertrude's. And even Hamlet's most piquant behavior, including his condemnation of his mother's sex life, is consistent with that of a son outraged by his mother's betrayal of his father; but it's inconsistent with that of a jealous son. Surely a jealous son wouldn't dither over killing Claudius. But the script shears off those inconsistencies, and the actors make it work. I could see it in Hamlet's eyes the moment he's alone with the ghost Oh, God, let it not find out that I want my mother.

This movie is for real and both Mr. Gibson and Ms. Close give commanding performances in their respective roles. This movie is proof that when given quality material under excellent direction, talented actors will flourish. The rest of the cast is stellar too, but this movie squarely revolves around the two lead characters and if their performances fail, then the whole movie fails. In recent years, Mel Gibson's reputation has taken hits, but there can be no denying that he is a gifted actor and in this movie presents a novel, dynamic interpretation of Hamlet that brings new life to the character, transforming a brooding young man into a man of action who takes charge and pays the price, wherein lays the tragedy. For Hamlet is a tragedy. However, unlike previous renditions of the play, which focus on the murky and somber, this rendition is lit up, the characters are active, Gertrude is young and beautiful, all of which make the ending even more provocative and powerful. This movie should have been nominated for an Academy Award in every major category; that it wasn't is perplexing. All in all, this movie represents another triumph for Franco Zefirrelli, once again who proves that Shakespeare can be produced for the screen, if you do it right.

This version of the classic story is thoroughly watchable. Gibson is perfect as Hamlet the Prince of Denmark, and he is well supported by Glenn Close (Gertrude), Alan Bates (Claudius), Ian Holm (Polonius) and Helena Bonham Carter (Ophelia). However, after already seeing Kenneth Branagh's 4-hour long version, I was left a little let down. Although this version was only 2 hours 20 minutes approximately, it was more boring in parts than Branagh's was. And no one can beat Kate Winslet as Ophelia, though Bonham Carter performed the lunatic scenes extremely well.The acting, as is aboveforementioned, is the highlight of this version. You can see the emotions boiling over on Gibson's face, and Close gives Gertrude's nature a remarkable realism as both a worried mother and a lustful lover. Bates is the best Claudius I have ever seen, and Holm displays in Polonius what makes him such a great actor.This Hamlet has an extremely good set design that complements the mood of each scene perfectly. The castle has a great look to it, both inside and outside.The costumes, particularly those worn by Close, are excellent. They really highlight the mood and temprament of her character perfectly. On top of this, all of the costumes worn by the players (actors in Hamlet's play) in colour and shape symbolise the message that Hamlet was trying to get across.Technically, this film is very well put together. The shots are each able to complement the action in that shot. Sound effects, especially in the ghost apparitions, as well as the lighting and juxtapositioning, set the moody feel of the film.Of course, one cannot escape comparing this to Branagh's masterpiece, though in its own right is is a great version of Shakespeare's play that, through its star power and easier-to-follow storyline, should attract the younger audiences that saw Baz Lurmann's 'Romeo + Juliet', '10 Things I Hate About You' and will possibly see the upcoming 'O'. ***1/2 out of *****.

It seems the filmmakers didn't actually read Shakespeare's text. No, they just took what they wanted from the Lawerence Olivier movie. The plot is out of order and slimmed down to its bare necessity, yet there is time for the non-canon Olivier created incest hint between Hamlet and Queen Gertrude. Could we have had the Something rotten in the state of Denmark bit instead? Casting is another issue. I understand that the far superior Branagh movie had its weak bits (Robin Williams and Charlton Heston come to mind), but this one has very few good moments. I do like Laertes and Polonius, but the rest of the cast is stale. Mel Gibson's creepy stubble is irritating, and one often wonders if he has any idea what he is saying. Many of the actors seem to have just memorized the part--they know less about what is being said than sophomores in high school.If you want a version of Hamlet, check out Kenneth Branagh's or even Lawerence Olivier. To be frank, even Disney's Hamlet is better.

First, the acting. Although Gibson does do an acceptable (barely) job, he often butchers the language and more than often rushes inexpressively through important lines. Gertrude as well, and also the more minor characters Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, really do shabby jobs with their lines and acting. The same is true with many of the other characters, especially Polonious, who is played once again as a pitiable and lovable old fellow, a role-casting that completely ignores many of his lines. In all fairness, Ian Holm's acting in the neither a borrower nor a lender speech (his goodbye speech to his son) is fine, but, I am guessing largely because of the director, he speeds through (quietly) all the lines that add any depth or anything despicable to his character before pronouncing loudly the only kind lines in the speech. The director does this more than once choosing carefully which lines to include, which to exclude, in order to present a story more to his liking. He cuts out many of the earlier scenes that develop Claudius' character, instead choosing to display his character by showing him drunk and laughing upon many an occasion. He also adds much of his own to the storyline, shifting scenes, showing characters spying on scenes that Shakespeare did not have them spying on. By cutting so much and by inserting his own additions the director has essentially leveled all the characters and make them much more dull and single-faceted. Hamlet comes off as a dumb, bewildered hothead, which makes his more intelligent lines (and this is largely thanks to Mel Gibson's mediocre acting) seem out of place and dull. Gertrude,Polonious, and Claudius, as well as Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, are similarly paired down until they lose all their intricacies and become single-trait characters Polonious is well-intentioned but silly; Gertrude is loving bewildered; Claudius is evil to the core, without any nuance; Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are conniving and a bit out of their league. In fact, the only actors somewhat major actors who play their roles at all satisfactorily are Ophelia, Horatio, and maybe Laertes, and they have together perhaps 100 lines. But, despite the poor acting, the director is most at fault for the failures of this film. He switches around many scenes, destroying the momentum and gradual realization that Shakespeare's brilliant scene progression. He changes characters and butchers lines in order to simplify the movie.I am sure this is all in some effort to make the play more accessible to a wider audience, but I think it is a tremendous insult not to the English language's most celebrated author, but also to that wider audience for the director to feel that Hamlet needs to be doctored up and dumbed down for anyone to appreciate it. I don't want to sound like another one of those people who is simply throwing a hissy fit over how the the movie is not being faithful to the play (like all those people who got angry about the Lord of the Rings flicks.) I can only stress that Shakespeare is the most famous English writer in all of history for a reason he was profoundly skillful not only at poetic writing but also at creating complex and interesting characters that did more than simply tell a story but also called upon important philosophical questions and questions about the interplay of the characters themselves. What the director has done by editing and shaping the play so much (and I admit that Hamlet is a LONG play when not edited) is remove many, many, (ie all) of those intricacies that make Hamlet more than any old movie. I do not object to adaptations in general. I do understand that the director has time constraints. I just feel that his choices, as well as much of the acting, make this adaptation one to be avoided.

Both deal completely with the psychological while omitting the political and they both go with the Freuden theory of the Oedipal complex. This was most apparent when they showed Hamlet thrusting at Gertrude in her bed. The problem with this interpretation is that in order to support it you must disregard everything you know about the culture of the renaissance.They also cut out the Act 4 Scene 4 soliloquy, granted about 90% of the Hamlet films do but this simply shows a misunderstanding of the text. That soliloquy is the second turning point, the moment where Hamlet realizes his duty and becomes a man, and the entire fifth act seems like a mindless contradiction without it.If you want to see a film of Hamlet from someone who actually understands the play I suggest Kenneth Branagh's film.

It doesn't use cinema to the fullest and leaves the movie locked in as a play. Glenn Close is Queen Gertrude. She's playing it on the flighty side. I like the character more as a harlot.

The film was directed by Franco Zeffirelli. Mel Gibson ranks at the top of my list of unlikeable Hollywood stars. However, as as reviewer, I have to give him credit for doing a creditable job in the demanding role of Hamlet. Film Hamlets don't have to be skilled Shakespearean actors. The ability to murmur a soliloquy that can be heard in the back row of an auditorium isn't required in the movies. The director can order numerous takes until one turns out well. He can use close-ups--as Zeffirelli does--to make sure we understand the actor's emotions. I don't think Gibson would have managed the role onstage, but on the screen he carries it off.Glenn Close, as Gertrude, is excellent. This is especially evident in the bedroom (closet) scene. She really does portray Gertrude's mixture of fear and shame in a convincing manner.However, in my opinion, acting honors go to Helena Bonham Carter as Ophelia. Bonham Carter's Ophelia is shy and innocent. She is flattered and frightened by Hamlet's professions of love, and she is crushed by his violent rejection. Most impressive is her portrayal of the mad scenes. She acts these so well that you actually are convinced that you are watching a young woman who has had a descent into mental illness.I've watched several Hamlets as part of a Shakespeare on film honors course. Each movie has it's strengths and weaknesses. This Hamlet deserves to be seen. Zeffirelli Is a brilliant director, Mel Gibson is a satisfactory Hamlet, and Helena Bonham Carter is the perfect Ophelia.I watched this movie on DVD, but it would do better in a theater. It's worth watching it in whatever format is available.

While this 1990 film is far from terrible, it is the weakest for me of the three Hamlet films I've seen- I loved Branagh's and especially Olivier's- and possibly Zeffirelli's weakest Shakespeare adaptation also. It does have some undeniably good points, it is very well made with very evocative scenery, beautiful atmospheric lighting, sumptuous costuming and cinematography that is moody yet shimmering. The music is haunting and the sound effects really enhance the mood. The script is condensed, but still is very powerful and moving when needed. Ian Holm is a very effective Polonious, the character is creepier than one would expect but it proved to be an interesting touch. Mel Gibson was better than expected, initially it does scream disaster but actually he is charismatic and delivers his lines with meaning. He is perhaps too old for the role(but understandably as other reviewers have pointed out) and Branagh and Olivier conveyed Hamlet's tragedy more convincingly but coming from a non-fan of Gibson this is not a bad performance at all. The acting honours go to Glenn Close, whose Gertrude is beautifully elegant, expressive and sincere. On the other hand, while it is a long play with much complexity and so forth(therefore a slow unfolding pace is necessary) there are some scenes that do come about as too drawn-out and laborious. Zeffirelli I do like for his sumptuous style and how directs actors(and singers), but he does bring forth ideas that are interesting in hindsight but don't do very well in terms of the motivations of the characters, Orphelia and Claudius in particular really suffer from this, and like his Jane Eyre it does get pedestrian in places. Two performances don't work. Alan Bates did have potential to, he is a great actor and has done creepy and evil very well before in The Shout for example. But, not helped by the fact that the scenes make Claudius the character he is are severely reduced, consequently Bates is never evil enough. The worst offender though is Helena Bonham Carter, she has given very good performances(A Room with a View, Sweeney Tood and Howards End) before and like Bates seemed ideal for the role. The reasons why she wasn't is largely again to do with Zeffirelli, the idea to not have Orphelia poignant and meek and instead have her as the complete opposite, strong-willed and almost headstrong was a big mistake, undermining her lunacy scenes. Whereas they should be moving, this change to the character is partly why Bonham Carter's performance feels wildly overacted. On the whole, didn't really work from my perspective but it is not a bad film. 6/10 Bethany Cox "}{"Title":"Alas poor Hamlet, I know you","Date":"29 May 2013","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Having just completed a review of the Branagh Hamlet, I felt it fair to offer my two cents on this one also.Shakespeare is not above criticism. Nor does a person require a Ph.D to enjoy, or even interpret his words. While the historical plays may benefit from some due diligence to flesh out the finer points, the plays were written for a colloquial Elizabethan audience who were hungry for entertainment, innovation and also a little sex and violence.Not too different from people today I think.Hamlet is a very complicated play about a conflicted, hallucinogenic kid who struggles to cope with an uneasy, perhaps immoral, relationship with his mother and the marriage of her to his uncle after the sudden death of his father. It's heavy stuff, and boy does it get heavier. All that said it can easily serve as digestible entertainment on the level of a vengeance story. There is a reason this play has lived for so long. A mathematician may even call it invariant with time. No matter how you transform it, the song remains the same. Even if this version of the song isn't perfect, it's largely a delight to the ear and also the eye. It is also quite accessible and easy to follow. I watched this movie and felt at home and also entertained.So enough of that. What about this movie? Well in nearly every area I demonized the Branagh production, this Franco Zeffirelli one excels. The ambiance is richer and more convincing in the dank castle halls. The editing flows surprisingly well for a two hour performance. The long lensing really zeroes in on the performances. There is a wealth of context in the relationships of Hamlet with all the major players. It feels as if Zeffirelli is acutely aware of subtext and exploits it with subtlety at every turn. With some exception, the actors are all steeped in the part and not simply engaging in dry recitation. Paul Scofield is absolutely scorching as the Ghost, who may, or may not actually exist. Ian Holm as Polonius is vibrant and also sad. Helena Bonham-Carter is just about perfect for Ophelia. Glen Close too really nails her unfortunately small part. Mel Gibson? Well he doesn't do all that bad. You really do take Hamlet as crazy, that's for sure. But Lethal Weapon could have easily been passed over for somebody better. On the other hand, without him, the film probably wouldn't have ever been made. To be or not to be I guess.

Even though many of the lead cast members are American, they pull off their roles wonderfully. Like many people, I'm used to seeing Mel Gibson as the tough Mad Max and the humorous Sergeant Riggs, but he gives an intense performance as hamlet. He merely doesn't stick to the play's dialog, but his eyes burn with an intensity that makes me think of the depressed, cunning, and vengeful Hamlet that is in the play. Ian Holm is perfect as the Polonius that I imagined from the play, the mumbling, sneaky, and funny but wise old man that works for the deceitful and treacherous Claudius. Helena Bonham Carter is youthful and pretty as Hamlet's doomed lover Ophelia. I can't help but smile when her character goes insane for her nonsense singing reminds much of her marvelous work as Mrs. Lovett from Sweeney Todd. Paul Schofield as the ghost of Hamlet's father is not only frightening but moving as a lost and doomed soul. But the thing I liked most about this movie was that it did not retract itself from the Shakespearean language of the play. This not only held true to the play but also made the film itself accurate to the time period. In addition, the set-decoration by two-time Oscar winner Dante Ferretti and costume design by Maurizio Millenotti is beautiful.

For God's sake that is what makes the play last as long as it does. If you had Othello there instead of Hamlet, Claudius would be dead by the end of Act One. Any production has to try to explain why Hamlet delays, why he is incapable of action. 2. His sexual disgust. His total revulsion at the thought of what his mother and uncle get up to in bed fill him with an utter disgust for all things sexual and this means that any kind of relationship with Ophelia is impossible. At the slightest hint of sex, Hamlet throws up. So, what does Mel Gibson give us? Lusty action-man. You could not get further from the character of Hamlet if you tried. There are lots of ways Hamlet can be played, but this isn't one of them!

Franco Zeffirelli had earlier made one of the great Shakespeare films, his Romeo and Juliet from 1968. (I have not seen his version of The Taming of the Shrew). Whereas his Romeo and Juliet was set against the background of the sunny Italian countryside, his Hamlet, in keeping with the play's Scandinavian setting, is appropriately cool and northern, although it was actually filmed in Scotland.Branagh's Hamlet was also filmed in Britain, but the two films are very different in terms of their visual style. Branagh shot his film in the depths of an icy winter against the formal grandeur of Blenheim Palace. The interior scenes, by contrast, are opulent and palatial; all the leading characters wear splendid costumes. (The film is updated to the nineteenth century, so that means crinolines for the women and military uniforms for the men). Branagh's aim seems to have been to contrast outward pomp and splendour with inner corruption and decay. Zeffirelli's film is set in spring against a castle on the cliffs above the sea. The exterior scenes are often sunny; the predominant tone is the bright green of the grass. In this case, however, the interior scenes are dull and claustrophobic; the predominant colour is the grey of the castle walls. The film is set in mediaeval times; not the high Middle Ages, which might have made for greater visual colour, but earlier, in the eleventh or twelfth century. (This period may have been chosen as this was the time when the Danish chronicler Saxo Grammaticus wrote the first version of the Hamlet story). The costumes, even of the royal or aristocratic characters, are dull and subdued; Zeffirelli seems to have intended them to reflect the mood of the characters in the play. I first saw this film in the cinema on the recommendation of my then girlfriend, but I did not hold out any great hopes for it, as Jill tended to judge every film solely on the looks of its leading man, a sort of female equivalent of those lust-stricken males who will solemnly insist, against all the evidence, that Pamela Anderson or Bo Derek really are great actresses. Mel Gibson was one of her particular heart-throbs, but at that time I regarded him principally as Mad Max and just could not envisage him as Hamlet. Well, Jill was right and I was wrong. Talk about coming to jeer and staying to cheer. Gibson is actually very good. He is not as polished as Branagh as a speaker of Shakespearean verse, but he brings his own rough honesty to the part. Like Branagh, however, he has little time for the traditional concept of Hamlet as indecisive, passive and melancholy. His Hamlet is vigorous and robust; his low spirits and disgust with the world are not the result of some innate character flaw but rather a natural reaction to the tragedies of his father's death, his mother's betrayal and the revelation that his uncle is a murderer. Of the other major characters, I liked Helena Bonham Carter as Ophelia (indeed, I preferred her to Kate Winslet). I also liked Alan Bates as Claudius. His performance is rather different to Derek Jacobi's in Branagh's film, but equally persuasive. Jacobi suggests that Claudius could have been a good man under different circumstances, before he allowed himself to be led astray by ambition and lust. Bates' character is a more straightforward villain, but one who is adept at hiding his villainy beneath an outward show of jovial good fellowship. Paul Scofield's Ghost is less frightening than Brian Blessed's, but perhaps more moving. The one major character I did not like was Glenn Close's Gertrude. In 1990 I still thought of her mainly as the bunny-boiler in Fatal Attraction, and her performance here did little to dispel that impression. To start with, she is nowhere near old enough to be Mel Gibson's mother. More importantly, Gertrude seemed to be fatally attracted not only towards her brother-in-law but also towards her son, embracing both with vigour and kissing them warmly on the lips. Close and Zeffirelli seem to have been heavily influenced by the idea that there is an incestuous attraction between Gertrude and Hamlet, something which has always seemed to me to owe less to Shakespeare than to Freud (or possibly to a misunderstanding of Freud), and which I think works to the play's detriment. The big difference between this version and Branagh's is length. Branagh's version is based on the full uncut text of the play and runs to over four hours, nearly twice the length of Zeffirelli's which, like Olivier's, is based on an abridged version. (The Fortinbras subplot, for example, is omitted altogether). Doubtless abridging the play in this manner makes commercial sense; three hours or thereabouts (Titanic, Lord of the Rings, etc) seems to be the outer limit of the modern cinema-goer's patience and Branagh's film did not do well at the box-office. Nevertheless, it is in my view the better of the two films, bringing out not only the full complexity but also the full emotional power of the play. Zeffirelli's version works well as a film in its own right, but it is little more than half of what Shakespeare actually wrote. 8/10 "},{"Title":"This is a movie","Date":"10 November 2003","Score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  Zeffirelli's Hamlet is naturalistic, accessible, and merciless.

The setting is actually medieval Denmark, with an amazing castle, and rich, but not new-looking costuming.  The result - a highly entertaining movie.Like no other, it focuses on Gertrude and Glen Close's lusty, needy, affectionate queen goes a long way to explaining Hamlet's trouble.  Who wouldn't be disturbed with *that* for a mother?   This Gertrude jumps into Claudius' bed with greater alacrity and enthusiasm than any other I've seen, making Hamlet's disgust and the dated definition of incest come alive for modern audiences.  Still, she measures her love out generously to the prince as well.Mel Gibson does not play the contemplative bits very well - he seems kind of in awe of the verse - but he's excellent in anguish, humor, anger, and charisma, and really makes the prince his own.  He even makes us laugh in the best duel scene by far.The biggest offence in the cutting is that so little of Horatio is left. Fortinbras is gone and unmissed; the other major parts are all excellently filled. This was the first Hamlet I saw, and whether from that natural advantage or their own merit, this Gertrude, Ophelia, and Polonius are the definitive standards for me.  Claudius and Hamlet are great, but there's no definitive here.  C'mon, Derek Jacobi played both roles!  And Branagh's done Hamlet, though his mannered treatment is not as engrossing.

Mel looks like Olivier --bleached --a bit also like David Hemmings --and with this new hair color --he becomes tragic. Not. I waited to see how he would deal with the greatest lines in the play and I noticed --and how deadly this is in films, and at that point you lose interest in everything but this, this head movement. The director must of told Mel to move his head in a tragic way like Larry did. And it is sublime. It is so, so, funny. I couldn't help but think of those dogs in the back of car bobbing up and down.

Now, it is to see or not to see Franco Zefferelli's 1990 Version of Hamlet.Shakespeare wrote this infamous play during his third period, more commonly known as his dark period. He could never have imagined how popular this play was to become.True to the period it was written in Hamlet is a dark, or tragic play. It follows one mans journey from normalcy to insanity because of the unfaithfulness of his incestuous mother after his father's murder. In this remake of the classic Franco Zefferelli turns a morose and somewhat confusing play into a vibrant, clear and dare I say, upbeat production that everyone should watch.I was a bit hesitant at first to watch the movie because Mel Gibson was playing the lead of Hamlet. I did not think that he'd be believable in that role, but he really proved me wrong. His interpretation of the character gave me an understanding of the plot that I didn't have after merely reading the play and watching the Kenneth Branagh version of the play. To say that his film cleared up a few things would certainly be an understatement. He played the role perfectly.Another wonderful actor who must be mentioned is Helena Bonham-Carter as Ophelia. She gave the term crazy a whole new definition. A character that goes over the hill in the midst of the film must be able to forget about everyone else and only play on his or her reason of instant insanity. She does this so well that by the end one doesn't know where Ophelia ends and Helena begins.The film did have a few shortcomings such as the director's choice of season and his butchering of the play. Yet, it's true that sacrifices must be made for the benefit of the contemporary audience. No one in today's day and age would like to sit through a complete, uncut, three-hour version of Hamlet. Therefore Zefferelli's actions can be forgiven and even, thanked. His choice of season though, remains an issue. Had he done it in winter, there would be added symbolism that was not seen in the movie. Other than that, Zefferelli made good choices from the actors to the music to the choreography of the duels.In an overall view of Franco Zefferelli's 1990 version of Hamlet starring Mel Gibson, it was phenomenal. It had all of the qualities of a modern day hit with none of the redundant story lines. To call this film a must-see isn't giving it enough credit.

For example, Horatio (in the play) is the model of friendship and yet, we have no sense of that relationship between him and Hamlet.  And what of poor Ophelia?  Why did she go insane?  Who Knows?  She shows no true feelings for Hamlet except annoyance and fear.  Her father treats her like a dog.  She seems to love her brother, Laertes, and he is safe in France so what's there to go mad about?  Polonius is just a jerk and there is no indication of his political motives and fawning manipulations.  The Ghost is a weepy shadow of his former self and conveys none of the anger or horror of his own murder.So here you have weak, flat and uninteresting characters in a script that can only be described as a jumbled perversion of the original.  (Get thee to a nunnery during the play?!?!)  One is forced to laugh in many places where laughter is not intended (Meet it is I set it down...), but it is a bitter laugh at best.  Unbelievable. I must find great fault in the direction, also.  How Zeffirelli can misuse such accomplished actors as Ian Holm and Paul Scofield is beyond me. Also Michael Maloney (who was able to read a line with honest conviction of his character despite the director) was so appallingly underused that one could only feel sorry for him. This is exactly the type of Shakespeare that you were exposed to in high school.  You remember those days.  Long, mind-numbing readings of Romeo and Juliet followed by that horrible Olivia Hussey film?  It was enough to make you hate the Bard. Rent Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet.  It is infinitely superior to Zeffirelli's.  Branagh's passion for the play is more than evident and his skill in bringing it to the screen is unsurpassed.  Branagh exemplifies why Shakespeare's work has survived so long.  Zeffirelli illustrates why high school kids see it as an endurance trial.

I am a rather faithful follower of Kenneth Branagh's version and didn't quite feel comfortable with the knowledge that, in Zefferelli's Hamlet, dialogue was shifted, huge sections deleted and major characters were given smaller roles. I have nothing against editing down Shakespeare to a 2 hour film, but Hamlet seemed entirely too epic to ever be shortened.What comes out of all this is a much more mature feeling film. Gone are a lot of the repetitions of crucial facts and certain character relationships that, in the long run, can be downsized without hurting the flow of the story.The biggest thing that got me was the deletion of the ghost's appearance to Horation right at the beginning. But after seeing this film, it works beautifully. We first meet the ghost at an emotional high point, riding Hamlet's internal roller coaster with him. I also really appreciate that the ghost was not made into a special effect or visual spectacle of some kind. He is a character and treated as such.Glen Close' Gertrude is utterly gripping. Silly, naive, but loving and kind. She's a victim as much as Hamlet. You despise her, yet pity her and eventually care for her. Ophelia is just terrific. Helena Bonham-Carter creates a fragile, haunted Ophelia. Even before the death of Polonius, you find yourself knowing that this poor girl will never make it in the world, being entirely too emotionally delicate.I did have some issues with the portrayal of Claudius. First, I am very loyal to Derek Jacobi's excellent portrayal of this character. Second, Zefferelli seems to be trying to make him sympathetic on a level that doesn't work with this character.Finally Mel Gibson himself. I think what makes his portrayal so excellent is that he seems to be slightly unhinged as soon as the story starts. His feigned madness is an augmentation of this, but it seems to flow from his performance much better that other Hamlets. His facial expressions are subtle enough not to be silly, but powerful enough to elicit a response from the audience. I respect that the director didn't try to make Hamlet a 'sexy' character in this, but rather focused on the story instead. The results are quite excellent.All in all, an entertaining, visually sumptuous ride, but somewhat lacking in the complex interpersonal and emotional core of the original story.

It's not a small task, and consider that outside Britain and the USA Shakespeare plays don't enjoy even the familiarity that derives from school. Simply, by the masses, they suck. And Hamlet is widely known as the man holding a skull saying To be or not to be  (Yorik's not very heard of). The fact of seeing a popular, almost proletary, and very humane and close Hamlet like Mel Gibson's instead of a pale and posh British actor can help somehow. For the rest, the direction doesn't risk anything again, it looks like Hamlet explained to the masses, including the oedipean kiss between mother and son (I'm not spoiling I suppose? everyone knows the plot).

The source material survives more or less intact, but the rhythms and tempo of Shakespeare's language, so beautiful on stage, are not entirely suited to celluloid, at least not with director Franco Zeffirelli's artless insistence on video-format close-ups and choppy continuity. Gibson, on center stage for most of the film, hasn't enough depth to carry the entire drama. He gives the Prince of Denmark as much fire as he can muster, but falls flat on his much-photographed bottom during every soliloquy, and his credibility is further damaged by the casting of 43-year old Glenn Close as his mother. The rest of the cast is well balanced by such stalwart pros as Scofield, Holm and Bates, and (wonder of wonders) Ennio Morricone has actually composed some effective, understated music, a welcome change of pace from his usual bombastic background scores.

But worse is to come when the dead king's ghost appears and reveals a ghastly murder ...William Shakespeare's Hamlet, written around 1600, is pretty untouchable as a property. I could say I think it's a bit long (especially Act IV), Ophelia has bugger all to do with the plot, and the ending is the old scribbler's trick of killing everybody off because you can't think of anything better, but there's not too much point because you probably either don't like Old Billy much or worse, are a Culture Snob who thinks he's a paragon. This movie version is very good all round really; the main difficulty in adapting Shakespeare to film is the stage direction, which is heavy on speeches and short on action. Gibson imbues it with energy and Zeffirelli wisely abridges it down to two hours, focussing on the passion and the agonising doubt at the core of the story. Fundamentally, the play is really about the essence of death; the horror of the King's murder, the damnation of Claudius, the tragedy of Ophelia, the bones of Yorick. His father's killing forces Hamlet to stare the horror of death straight in the face and he doesn't know how to live - to sleep, perchance to dream. Gibson is great in the lead, ably supported by Bates, Holm and Scofield (all of whom played Hamlet on stage to great acclaim) and he makes the tough-going dialogue surprisingly palatable and mellow. There's also a fine incidental score by Ennio Morricone and excellent production design by Dante Ferretti (most exteriors were shot at Dunnottar Castle on the east coast of Scotland), and it was the first film made by Gibson's respected Icon production company. I like this movie a lot, as I do any movie which tries to take the illustrious High Arts and turn them into something anyone can appreciate. I think it's the best movie adaptation of the classic tale - the 1948 Laurence Olivier and 1996 Kenneth Branagh versions are both a bit stodgy, but the cheapie 1969 one with Nicol Williamson is not bad. Weirdly, the best movie versions of Hamlet (as with most of Shakespeare's plays) are the ones that are cagily disguised as something else, such as Akira Kurosawa's corporate killer drama Warui Yatsu Hodo Yoku Nemuru / The Bad Sleep Well, Tom Stoppard's whimsical Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead, Dave Thomas and Rick Moranis' hilarious The Adventures Of Bob & Doug McKenzie Strange Brew (which mostly involves beer and ice-hockey, two crucial elements Shakespeare left out), and Aki Kaurismäki's lovably nutty Hamlet Liikemaailmassa / Hamlet Goes Business, in which Hamlet is the heir to a rubber-duck manufacturing company. Also, this movie is perhaps the perfect example of an international movie with no homeland; it was funded by French money, distributed by Americans, stars an Australian, was made by an Italian, filmed in the UK and is set in Denmark ! Don't be put off by the intellectual pedigree; this is the world's oldest revenger's tragedy and a great thought-provoking film.

You can never tell. Forty years ago a sweet young thing was handed Hamlet as a reading assignment. My professor, from whom I heard the story, said her response was Oh that was wonderful! When is this Hamlet guy going to write another one?Apocryphal? Perhaps.When I had the Gibson version thrust upon me, I had never seen the star. My response was, you've got to be in jest! A Hollywood actor? Then I noticed the supporting cast and decided to give Mr. Gibson's effort a chance. Well . . . The late Sir John Gielgud once noted that just as there were no bad Hamlets, there were, neither, any complete ones. (I don't know I absolutely refuse to consider K. Branagh an actor at all; so as far as his Hamlet goes . . . ?) This movie version is better than any I have seen in several ways. The portrayal of Ophelia is most beautifully accomplished and very touching. Heretofore I couldn't wait for the poor thing to drown. Alan Bates as Claudius is most interestingly cast, and he manages to be just right for the role, but then he's a superb actor, indeed. As for Ian Holm's Polonius - I certainly wouldn't want to follow it I can't think of a word other than perfect. Many actors have captured the riotously funny idiocy of the rambling dolt, but few the pathos. Holm makes him almost endearing.G. Close manages not to be revolting as Gertrude. I trust this is not a spiteful remark. There are those who doubtless are quite good, but that I never want to see again. For example, Katharine Hepburn is one (except for the very early Tracy and Cary Grant comedies). Now to Mr. Gibson. He gives flesh to Gielgud's axiom. His overall performance is, quite frankly, as acceptable as any I've seen. As opposed to Jacobi, who brought out the acerbity better than most have, and made the relationship with Horatio acutely heartwarming, Gibson, especially in his major scene with Polonius, makes superb comedy; and he excels, exceptionally, in honing, if that's the word, the profundity of the dilemma the Prince finds himself in the metaphysical dimension, as it were. A simple line like Readiness is all. becomes penetrating in a haunting, prescient way I've not before encountered. (It is a shame that Olivier never remade his version, which was so sliced up and Freudianized as to be virtually unrecognizable.)Where things go wrong is in the final scene, and I put the blame here entirely on the director. I found the fight scenes and the various killings absurdly done. Perhaps Zeffirelli realized this because he cut the perhaps most heart-rending line in the play (when delivered correctly in a context that hasn't been rendered a shambles). I fear that if Horatio had come out with Now cracks a noble heart, I'd have laughed. At first I couldn't believe the cut; then I was grateful for it.Since I began with a comment by Gielgud, I'll end with a comment about him. There has never been a Closet Scene to equal the electrifying performance Sir John gives of it in an early radio broadcast, of which year I know not.Were it not for that loused-up final scene, I'd have given the movie a higher rating. See it. You can always stop the tape (or walk out of the theatre) before that debacle of a final touch.

Of course, that Richard Gere's film FIRST KNIGHT being the same case.====== THE FILM =====>Then around September of 91 or so this HAMLET was shown. From the poster, I thought that this film would be something to the effect of Robin Hood, of having that essence of medieval style of grand majestic royalty (which I happened to love a lot). So I went to see it.During the course of the film, I found that this film was incredibly draggy and hard to follow in terms of its language spoken and the pace that it was going. Keep in mind that was the time when I have absolutely no idea who Shakespeare was and knew nothing about his works. But at the end of the film, when I left the theater and knowing that the principal characters died, it was then that out of curiosity I began to be intrigued by the plot of the story and say Hey, this is interesting. Hence, I began my own study of the play and soon enough I learnt about HAMLET and Shakespeare.Therefore, I must say that I am truly grateful that I saw this film (and missed Costner's Robin Hood....Thank God!) because it was this very film that initiated me to the works of Shakespeare.And on the topic of the film itself, I believe that this was truly how the Bard himself would have wanted it to be played - in all its majestic proportions.Following this film, I did my own study on Shakespeare's other works like King Lear and Macbeth.

Shakespeare took the well-known (at the time) story of Prince Hamlet of Denmark, and transformed it into a psychological and existential drama unlike anything scene before. Now, director Franco Zeffirelli, who was behind the classic 1968 Romeo and Juliet, brings his version of Hamlet to the screen, with the seemingly odd choice of Australian action star Mel Gibson in the title role. Behind Mel is an almost exclusively British cast, with Glenn Close as Queen Gertrude being the exception. Indeed, several important cast members have themselves played Prince Hamlet on stage. Mel creates an energetic, melancholy Hamlet who works well on screen, even if he's a bit too energetic on occasion. A young Helena Bonham-Carter is wonderful as the tragic maiden Ophelia, while Close, Alan Bates (as the usurper Claudius), Ian Holm (as ill-fated adviser Polonius), and Paul Scofield (as Hamlet's murdered father) all provide seasoned support. Zeffirelli has trimmed Shakespeare's lengthy text (his longest play) considerably, making things flow more smoothly; for a less commercial, edit-free Hamlet, seek out Kenneth Branagh's 1996 film. I give Hamlet a 10/10. Would that Zeffirelli had done an adaptation of Macbeth.

No matter how much I love The Hobbit and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (yes, there is someone who likes those and Shakespeare), Hamlet is the true peak of literary achievement. That said, the play is a chore for an audience, spanning 3880 lines and often over four hours on stage or film (see Branagh's 1996 film, which cuts the first quarto text entirely and still clocks in over four hours). And it is a chore for a director and his/her actors, with seemingly every scene and every character capable of encompassing infinite variety. Thus, it is the most difficult of Shakespeare's works to perform, on stage or film; and Zeffirelli flashes moments of genius in his film, but does not quite succeed in giving us the true play on screen, as Kenneth Branagh would later do.Zeffirelli commented when working on his film that he was going to move Hamlet himself away from the whiny, brooding prince of recent times and back toward the action hero he had been in Shakespeare's day. In light of that thought, the casting of Mel Gibson fresh off of Lethal Weapon is perfect. However, Zeffirelli did not follow through on this idea. Gibson broods more than either Branagh's or Olivier's (those being the two best-known Hamlet film productions along with this one), but is also reduced to a difficult mixture of melancholic brooding and uncontrollable rage, without many of the subtleties and nuances of Hamlet in the complete text. Gibson performs admirably, but his performance is hurt considerably by the changes to the character.Meanwhile, Zeffirelli also treats the play with Freud and Olivier's favorite theme to claim in it--the Oedipus Complex. However, where Olivier's film is tied together by the Oedipus complex and it is shown quite ingeniously mostly through his use of the camera, Zeffirelli seems more just to want to shock us with the kiss of the closet scene. He foregrounds the complex with the casting of Glenn Close, but her performance is too dull to really draw it out and the production thus suffers from a lack of cohesiveness from the Oedipus complex's seeming as a side-plot involving the main character and thus only over-complicating matters rather than informing us about Hamlet.Still, a few of Zeffirelli's choices are absolutely wonderful. Rather than the typical silly old man, Polonius becomes an intelligent and powerful political operator, performed brilliantly by Ian Holm, who steals the film in my opinion. Meanwhile, his picture of the ghost is an absolutely magnificent touch. While it works against the play's statements that he appears in his armor and ready for battle, the frail old man is a somehow more startling and definitely a more human image. In this case, Zeffirelli appears again to be hearkening to older stage conventions, which viewed Hamlet as driven by his paternal love, and it works to brilliant effect in this film.In addition to those already mentioned, Helena Bonham Carter performs excellently as Ophelia, portrayed in a fairly standard manner but done so quite well; Paul Scofield's performance as the ghost is wonderfully poignant, as the underrated actor again shines; and Alan Bates's Claudius is commendable, though he admittedly often seems more intelligent than other elements (especially Polonius) would make him seem.Zeffirelli's direction itself is not terribly noticeable, with the one exception being Hamlet's wonderful separation. He always seems to be hanging out above everyone else, watching them, perfectly befitting the most intelligent of all literary characters. It's as though he is a step above everyone and sees everything that happens, which, of course, Hamlet does. Otherwise, the direction is not particularly good or bad.All in all, Zeffirelli creates an interesting film that highlights some aspects of the play wonderfully and includes some fine acting. But if you're really looking for a film version of Hamlet the play, look to Branagh or (if you must) to Olivier, since this text is nowhere near the play's. (Even Olivier's is considerably closer.) But it's a truly entertaining film version of the most spectacular play ever written and it deserves credit for that.

He is one of the best, but at the same time, one of the most underrated Shakespeare directors. All of Franco Zeffirelli's films, but particularly Shakespeare adaptations, seem to reflect his artistic soul. All of them are very individual interpretations of the great English playwright. The most famous, probably, is ROMEO AND JULIET (1968) which is one of his earliest films, except for THE TAMING OF THE SHREW made two years earlier. However, while some people may see something dated in the two above mentioned films, HAMLET is, no doubt to say, exceptionally good not only thanks to direction but thanks to its new convention and absolutely great performances! Isn't acting the critical factor when concerning Shakespeare's plays?Indeed, most cast give breathtaking performances. Glenn Close, Alan Bates, Nathaniel Parker, and Helena Bonham Carter shine in their roles. I also loved the performance of Ian Holm. They all play naturally and the action moves fluently. No moment seems to be boring although most viewers know the story perfectly well. But among the cast, one man is really extraordinary, thanks to whom the film does a great job. That is Mel Gibson in the main role. Though known for his roles in Lethal WEAPON, FOREVER YOUNG and many other films, I think that the role of Hamlet is his finest performance so far. Watching this film, you will see that he really felt his role heartfelt. Franco Zeffirelli knew whom to give the main role. I even dare say that all other portrayals of Hamlet seem to be in the shadow of Mel Gibson's portrayal in this film. Once you see him in this role, you will never forget him. I promise you that!Another great acting talent of the movie is Glenn Close. The character of Gertrude is really difficult to portray and I admire Glenn, particularly the way she expresses the change of heart. First, living in lie with Claudius, the murderer of her first husband, and then, realizing the guilt. Consider her face expressions, particularly, in the last scene when she is poisoned and regrets her evil deeds. Alan Bates is also exceptionally memorable as Claudius. He portrays a man ready to wickedness, but also ready to doubt the righteousness of his deeds. And yet, Helena Bonham Carter. What a portrayal of Ophelia's madness! These eyes! Really impressive performance worth your attention!There is one more factor that comes to my mind when thinking about the movie ... the lavish luxurious costumes. There is a gorgeous wardrobe in the film, which is certainly not the most significant thing in the film, but taking into account that it is Zeffirelli's movie, wardrobe is an important point. Remember his BROTHER SUN SISTER MOON (1972) or THE TAMING OF THE SHREW (1966)? There are similarly rich costumes in HAMLET.I would recommend Zeffirelli's HAMLET to everyone. If you liked ROMEO AND JULIET (1968), you will love this movie. A must-see for Zeffirelli's fans, a must-see for Gibson's fans! Yet, a must-see for all movie fans who know what a good performance is!
