[{"Title":"Groundbreaking war film, as misunderstood as the title.","Date":"27 September 2003","Score":"86 out of 115 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, War","Review":"  Less than 5 years after the Vietnam War officially ended, Director and acclaimed (but aged) film writer Sam Fuller attempted to recount the experiences he encountered while serving as an infantry soldier in the European Theatre of WW2. He had written many war scripts in his day, but fully realized that the world would not be ready for the true story of WW2, (He is quoted infamously as saying that a truly realistic war picture would involve live grenades and machine guns in the theatre). As his career ended and the world changed, he decided to make a go of his life long pet project... to make a film about the REAL story of WW2, about his own experiences in the Big Red One, or The First Infantry Division.Too ahead of it's time to be appreciated during it's birth, and too dated to be appreciated in hindsight.Some of the other user comments suggest this film is inferior to modern war films. Of course this film is not at the caliber of Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers in it's war scenes. How could it? When it is of a time closer to The Green Berets (John Wayne wins The Vietnam War) then to anything that came after it. Infact I would go as far as to say that this film broke the first ground, and made films like Platoon, Hamburger Hill, and Full Metal Jacket socially acceptable, and paved the way for films like Saving Private Ryan. Sure, Apocalypse Now has better War scenes, but is so fictional in it's scripting and epic war moments that it missed the point of the soldier on the front (and is widely regarded as being unrealistic by Vietnam Vets). The Big Red One tells the story from a WW2 Vet's point of view, Sam Fuller, and is wonderfully acted by a WW2 vet, Lee Marvin. Perhaps the last film to have such credits.Sure, The Big Red One is cheesy, and harkens to a time when war films were more about the characters, then the violence. Still, there is something charming about the scripting, and Lee Marvin holds the movie together, while being surrounded by actors who were trendy on the cheap for 1979. The film also has technical inaccuracy, as in the Sherman tanks used as Panzers. However, the real strength of the film is in the script, and not in the battles. It breaks ground in it's defiance of films like the Sands of Iwa Jima. The soldier is not a clean sterile fighter for the holiest do goodynest army of all time, he is a human being locked in a battle for survival, and most importantly, he hasn't lost his sense of humor, or his libido.Regardless of it's dated, almost 70's TV movie feel, I must mention that this film was first to show D-Day in a light other than that cast by The Longest Day, and uses some very clever cinematography to illustrate the violence. Sam Fuller consciously decided to make the battles less violent, and choose to focus on the characters instead, depicted the main characters as cynical and the fallen as humorous tragically short lived figures. This film also was first to introduce words like replacement, non-Coms and Krouts to the war movie dictionary. It has the entire bangalore scene from Saving Private Ryan (although merely a concept compared to SPR) and shows North Africa, Italy, France, Germany, and a concentration camp. Before this film, WW2 was only depicted in such an epic manor that Bible films are seemingly tame.THE BOTTOM LINE This film was one of the last war pictures to emerge from the dying studio system, and is comparable in the way of battles to The Green Berets, Longest Day, etc. However it shines in the script category. and was first to show soldiers as young clumsy men, and not heroes. It attempts almost too much and that is it's strongest limitation. Still, a must see for war movie fans who can appreciate the older films. 7/10.

You never see it on TV, I know of no widescreen version available on video, and no one talks about it in books, newspapers or on television, but it is worth renting.  Made up of a number of short vignettes, the main characters experience everything from delivering a baby (in a tank!) to D-Day on Omaha Beach to liberating a death camp as they fight their way through Africa, Sicily, and Western Europe. I understand that it is semi-autobiographical, and boy, does it pack a wallop. From the opening scene to history repeating (almost) itself at the end, it is well-crafted, says a lot and leaves the viewer changed.  When the voice-over at the end says that the only glory in war is surviving, you KNOW why.  Watch in particular for how Lee Marvin leads his squad, in particular when he gives an extra clip of M-1 ammunition to one of his soldiers at the Death Camp to help the soldier process, in a unique way, the horror of what they have discovered.  It is unforgettable.

The Big Red One is one of those films. For all the hoopla created by Saving Private Ryan (another excellent film, which, in my opinion, had a better understanding of it's subject than a lot of it's critics gave it credit for), it owed a great deal to what Sam Fuller did a decade and a half before.Lee Marvin, an actual WWII veteran himself, holds the film together as the tough but exhausted seargent. When he tells Mark Hamill (yes, Luke Skywalker, folks) that you don't murder animals, you kill them, the look on his face after that seems to say that he wished it could be some other way. It's hard to grab defining moments in this film as stand-out, but the two sequences that stick the most to my mind are the taking of the insane asylum and the horrors of the concentration camp. While other movies have focused on specific campaigns, The Big Red One deserves high marks for painting the broad canvass of the Second World War from the perspective of the guys who actually had to do the work.

(The film runs 162 minutes, not 158 as stated on the IMDb title page.) The old version was very good, and this newer version makes the film even better. Either way, you have a solid war movie.For men - and that's who will primarily watch this movie because it's a guy's flick with no romance and no women leads - this keeps the action coming, but without overdoing it. You can different kinds of action scenes, too, not just people shooting at one another.I also appreciated the photography. It's a good visual movie. The added footage looked sharper and clearer than the previously shown, but either way it was nicely filmed and directed. Of course, the director is the famous Sam Fuller, who did a number of tough film noirs, among other things.Speaking of tough, the person who makes this movie a notch above average is Lee Marvin. He is just excellent as the tough-on-the-outside-but-soft-hearted underneath commanding officer, known only as The Sergeant. With his deep voice and weathered face, Marvin makes for an effective leader of tough guys. The language was much milder in here than you find in more modern films, although it can be crude in a few spots. There are no f-words and about seven usages of the Lord's name in vain. However, there are a number of sexual references, some crude but, hey, that's guy talk. All the young soldiers were good, too. It was especially interesting to see baby-faced Star Wars' star, Mark Hamill, playing one of the soldiers in the unit called The Big Red One.The story with narration by one of the soldiers, tells of Marvin and his handful of men who travel and do battle from North Africa to Sicily, then Italy, the beaches of Normandy on D- Day and into Germany in addition to a few other memorable stops such as an insane asylum.It's long, but I never found it boring and the men never stay too long in one spot.

It is a bit dated, and the low budget really shows, but SF clearly did the best with what he had, and it stands as a great monument on war from a director who was really there.  All of the characters are very likeable, and well acted by Lee Marvin, Mark Hamill, Robert Carradine, and company.  The movie is fiction but influenced by real events.  Many of the scenes, especially one involving a group of older sicilian women who cook a big meal for the squad, ring very true, since a fiction writer would obviously try and spice them up--the film is very honest, and it is good that Fuller left this story for us.  I also like how it ends on a positive, optimistic note.The real glory of war is surviving.

I knew though, once it became official that the New York film festival was premiering it, that the reconstructed version of Samuel Fuller's epic was going to be seen as no longer being truncated. When it was over, I felt as though, like with his other films I've seen (Pickup on South Street and Shock Corridor to a degree), that I'd seen something special- a work of art that's told with such straight-forward precision it elevates the B genre. There is something about war that is, like life usually, a contradiction. There are scenes and instances in Fuller's film where confusion occurs, and tragedy comes about as if it's springing out of nature. But what Fuller captures as well is the camaraderie, so to speak, of the platoon- the humor, the understanding of one another that strengthens when other soldiers come and go without much notice. And the strengths and humanity of the sergeant (here portrayed in a performance that could possibly be better or at least on part with what was in The Dirty Dozen) comes through clearest of all. The Big Red One, at its extended length, is one of Fuller's triumphs as a storyteller; infusing his own experiences in the first battalion (the cigar that re-appears with one character signify who he made as his kind of alter-ego) as well as others he fought with, stories he heard, etc. While it is a film that lends itself partly to the ideals of the old-fashioned WW2 films, it's very modern in its personal take on the situations, battle sequences/outcomes, and the dynamics of the characters. To put it another way, what Oliver Stone was to Vietnam, Samuel Fuller was to WW2, to an extent. Though his version of, for instance, the invasion of Omaha beach, doesn't have the grainy, documentary feel of Saving Private Ryan, the realism and suspense and chaos it all there. Fuller's experience as a journalist - his sense of detail and pacing in the scenes - is what gives that sequence involving Marvin and his men, among others, such truth. Along with the Israeli cinematographer Adam Greenburg, who would go on to lens the first two Terminator films, The Big Red One brings forth numerously unforgettable images. The climax, in and of itself, in which the quote I mentioned is put to the test for Mark Hammil's Pvt. Griff, is extraordinary. The shots, the faces, and usage of light, and the acting by him and the others, brought to me some of the strangest emotional reaction (not as in crying, but empathizing) I ever felt in a war film. In that respect the film, in scenes like that, and in the little moments with the four horsemen and their episodes, are on the level (if not superior) to the emotional connectedness that Spielberg or Stone achieved.The script is a feat as a story of the stead-fast progression of the soldiers from North Africa to Germany. However without the cast it might have faltered. Marvin pulls off a rounded character by the end and is successful in his own right, but the four privates are the show. Most of the time if not all through, Ward and Di Cicco (not very well known actors to me before viewing this film) are very dependable for some comic and sensible interludes. Carradine's Zab (Fuller's re-incarnation) is in a performance of insight, amusement, and is a crucial piece to the film. It is Hammil then that comes away as most rewarding. His character is given a brilliant arc as the sharpshooter, and in the cremation scene, he proves he is far more valuable and compelling an actor most would give him credit for. My advice to people who think he can only play Skywalker and the occasional voice-over work is that this film is a must-view.I can say, in wrapping up this review, that there was not much at all to nit-pick or complain about with this film, long length and all. There may or may not have been truth to the English-speaking Germans, but that didn't matter to me. When some of the dialog was not entirely clear as well, that was not a problem. Almost every frame (in particular a few key long shots on the beaches and some close-ups of faces and eyes in the third act) are like carefully molded sculptures/paintings of the condition of war. Bottom line, I can't tell whether or not the film has bettered from the additions, but I do know for certain I would not want to sit through a truncated version when these forty or so minutes fit in so well. So, whether you've seen the original 1980 version or not, when this new version comes to DVD, it's for certain to be a collector's item.

There was no doubt that it had some of the most emotive scenes of any war film but seemed fractured. At times there seemed to be far more realism in it's morality than other films which was understandable since Sam Fuller actually served with The Big Red One at this time so much of it is a first hand account of events and attitudes. I have now read some of the background to the making of the film,I think in the L.A. Times,which now makes sense of the flaws in the film. Apparently Sam Fuller's budget was cut to the minimum by the studios after a regime change and the original screenplay as shot was hacked to death by the same studio against Fuller's wishes. This was not the film he wanted to make but he made it. And it was not the film that he shot as is indicated by the very complete screenplay notes he made. I think it is Richard Schickel, the noted reviewer of Time magazine, who has laboured to find the missing outtakes and to put the film together in its complete form with over 40 minutes added to the length. Apparently this more complete cut significantly improves the film and adheres to Sam Fullers screenplay more accurately. This new cut is now playing to limited audiences and, hopefully, will be available on DVD. It must be emphasized that this is not the film that Fuller originally wanted to make as the budget was cut by 75%. Some of the comments made by other reviewers on these pages are valid as to authenticity specifically in battle scenes. But Fuller did not have the budget that both the Longest Day and Saving Private Ryan had. It will be interesting to see the new cut. Hopefully it will flesh out what could have been one of the greatest Second World War films.

They call it farcical, uneven, clichéd. They find it farcical, I believe, because the film revels in the absurdity of war rather than gloss over it. They would rather watch a film, like Saving Private Ryan, which ignores absurdity in favor of violence. These people find it uneven because the important scenes (like the D-Day and North African invasion) take only a minute or two to conclude, while other scenes, less typical of a war movie, spread out before us. They call it clichéd because the movie is unsubtle in its treatment of character development and plot.I cannot agree with these beliefs. The Big Red One is not only one of the greatest WWII films, it is also one of the greatest war movies.Sam Fuller's film, which was butchered by the studio, is the picaresque tale of 5 members of the First Infantry, known, because of their shoulder patch, as the Big Red One. The film moves from one story to the next without spending too much time on any particular tale.The individual vignettes, as they must, vary in quality, but on the whole are excellent. The Big Red One stirs within you a desire to run right out and tell your friends about this amazing scene or that.There's the soldier who loses his testicle, the birthing scene in the belly of a tank, Lee Marvin, in Middle Eastern garb, traipsing across a beach, soldiers dug into holes over which a Panzer tank division travels, the entire Mad House segment... The list goes on.Some people dislike the absurdest nature of several of this film's stories, but, for me, those surreal touches make this film great.Without them (and there are a lot), you would be left with a very normal and very boring film. Using bandoleers as stirrups is genius, as is the woman faking crazy as she whirls through a monastery, slicing German throats.The performances are solid, for this type of film, but if you are looking for subtlety, go elsewhere. Each character is drawn in broad strokes; you never learn too much about them, but you learn enough to understand who they are and why. Lee Marvin, as usual, is amazing. He is one of the great, gruff actors of our time, bringing a special, intangible quality to every film in which I've seen him. He makes every movie he's in better just by showing up. There are too few actors about whom you can say that.Like the acting, the direction is masculine, but, for a war movie, that's a compliment. In some ways, Fuller's direction here and in his other films reminds me of Hemmingway's writing - terse and effective. Both men believe in an economy of shots or words, depending on their medium, but, through that economy, they attain a muscular sort of poetry akin to the beauty of a horse's rippling muscles as it races on a plain. Fuller's direction here, though not his best when compared to Underworld USA or Shock Corridor, is still better than most, especially considering that this was his first film in several years.All in all, I find the Big Red One to be an exemplary war movie, even in its emasculated format (I cannot wait to see the restored, 140 minute print, which should improve upon scenes that feel to brief in this version). It's certainly no Apocalypse Now, but it puts to shame most World War II epics before or since.

The film is brilliantly scripted, and feels very realistic in it's depictions of World War 2 battles. There's a reason why the film is realistic. It's based on actual experiences that the Writer/Director, Sam Fuller, went through during his time in the war.The movie follows several soldiers in The 1st Infantry. Lee Marvin brilliantly plays The Sergeant. Four soldiers under his command, played by Mark Hamill, Robert Carradine, Kelly Ward and Bobby Di Cicco, have been named The Four Hoursemen, and they become well known among other soldiers. Despite being in a position and squad, where most troops come in and die before others even know their names, these four manage to live through the most dangerous situations and missions. Most of the time without even getting a scratch on them.There's no big overall story in The Big Red One. It's made up of many different combat scenes that The Sergeant and his men fight in. The D-Day footage is almost as realistic and frightening as those shot in Saving Private Ryan, and this was made 18 years earlier. There are some very dramatic and intense scenes in this film, but it avoids making the viewer feel  too depressed or saddened, thanks to a lot of light humour throughout the script.Although The Big Red One is not well known, it easily ranks up there with Saving Private Ryan, Apocalypse Now, and Tora Tora Tora as one of the greatest war films of all time. I can't recommend this movie enough to anyone reading this. The Big Red One does not disappoint. It gets a perfect 10 from me. "},{"Title":"BR1 was excellent.

About 3 minutes of original film to 15 of new. It's so obvious, if you know the first movie, that Hollywood forced Sam FUller to trim away most of the grit and pain. BR1 is tough and real, but squeaky-50s-clean compared to the Reconstruction. All the real impact was trimmed away. That must have hurt.There was a point, about 2 hours in, I thought, I can't take much more of this. And it hit me that Fuller intended that. Pushed us to that limit, so we would experience a tiny bit of the exhaustion, the overload, the need to just get away from it for a while. Private Ryan never even got close. I can't think of any WWII movie that got close. And I've watched them all.Band of Brothers is the only work I would put in the same frame as the Reconstructed BR1.

However I was about 15 when I saw it and many teenagers of my generation still enjoyed feature films about the second world war . Alas a lot has happened in the film world not to mention my life so when I saw it again at the weekend I was very much underwhelmed by the movie First of all I found it rather disjointed and episodic . In many ways THE BIG RED ONE laid the foundations for BAND OF BROTHERS but whereas that acclaimed mini series dedicates the first episode to jump school training followed by nine one hour episodes from June 1944 to the Summer of 1945 , this movie has a running time of less than two hours featuring a timeframe that lasts from Spring 1942 to May 1945 which seems a bad idea with hindsight Cut to Algeria 1942 , cut to Sicily 1943 , cut to Normandy 1944 etc . Also THE BIG RED ONE lacks a budget big enough to make the film convincing ( Well it was made by Lorimar the company who brought us DALLAS ). No matter where the action takes place the landscape resembles sunny California especially the beaches of Western france which looks suspicously like the same place BAY WATCH is filmed , every expense has been saved where location filming is concerned . I`m also surprised I didn`t notice something from my first viewing and that`s the German tiger tank not being a tiger tank at all but it being an American Sherman , and strange that you never see two tanks side by side . No doubt the production team couldn`t afford to hire more than one tank . And looking back on this film 20 years later after seeing APOCALYPSE NOW , A BRIDGE TOO FAR , CROSS OF IRON , SAVING PRIVATE RYAN , THE THIN RED LINE and BLACK HAWK DOWN I can`t say the battle scenes in THE BIG RED ONE are all that impressive to me in 2003.THE BIG RED ONE  does have a few good points . First of all it does make mention of the British contribution to the war which is something you don`t see in American films in recent times . There`s an interesting subplot ( Though it`s painfully underwritten ) about Mark Hamill`s character being a coward . There`s also a great line about it  Being okay to kill sane people but not insanes ones ?  . But the best part of the movie is a moving segment featuring Lee Marvin`s tough Sarge befriending a child who`s just been liberated from a Nazi death camp , though once again this is skated over far too quickly in a film that`s got too many negatives and not enough positives . As I said I waited 20 years between seeing it for the first and second time and could happily wait for another 20 years before seeing it a third time   "},{"Title":"Occasionally Striking, Overall Unconvincing","Date":"25 June 2004","Score":"20 out of 32 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, War","Review":"  Films about the Second World War were not particularly common in the post-Vietnam aftermath of the 1980s, but 'The Big Red One' is one of the few exceptions. War films tend to fall into two categories. The first, such as 'The Longest Day' or 'The Dambusters' concentrates on a single battle or episode in the war's history. The second, such as 'In Which We Serve' or 'Twelve O'Clock High', (or, to take an example from another war, the more recent 'Master and Commander') follows the fortunes of a unit of fighting men over a longer period. 'The Big Red One' is a film of the second type and details the experiences of a platoon of the First Infantry Division of the US Army. (The title refers to the numeral which formed that division's badge). It concentrates on the veteran Sergeant and four of the soldiers fighting under him as they fight their way through the European theatre of war. Although other members of the platoon are killed, these five survive the war unscathed. We first meet them during the North Africa campaign of 1943, and follow them through Sicily, France, Belgium and into Germany. The film, which ends with the liberation of a concentration camp in Czechoslovakia in 1945, does not have a coherent plot, but rather consists of a series of short vignettes illustrating each phase of the war. This is not a traditional big-scale war film. Despite the fact that the featured platoon takes part in a number of major battles, it appears to have been made on a relatively small-scale budget. The battle scenes are too small-scale to be convincing, and are unrealistic in comparison not only with recent films such as 'Saving Private Ryan' but also with others of the same period such as 'Cross of Iron'. While the scenes of, say, the D-Day landings are not too bad, at other times the action sequences have a near-farcical quality. Particularly risible was the scene where our heroes attack a German-held lunatic asylum (a suspiciously Mediterranean-looking building, even though it is supposed to be in the Belgian Ardennes), and Stephane Audran, playing a resistance fighter who has infiltrated the building posing as one of the inmates, waltzes around slitting the throats of the Nazi soldiers. At no time is any serious attempt made to conjure up a realistic atmosphere; we always have the impression that we are watching actors on a set rather than soldiers on a battlefield.The lack of verisimilitude might not matter if we were presented with characters we can sympathies with, but the soldiers in this film are a fairly unsympathetic lot, with the partial exception of Mark Hamill's Private Griff, a semi-pacifist who is suspected of cowardice by his colleagues. We see Lee Marvin's sergeant explaining to him that soldiers don't murder, they kill. We then see a stereotypically brutal Nazi officer explaining exactly the same thing to his men. If, however, the idea was to make a pacifist point about the moral equivalence of the two sides, this idea is not pursued, particularly at the end, where the final scenes in the concentration camp highlight the evils of Nazism. Incidentally Marvin, who was in his mid-fifties when the film was made and looks older, seems to old to be playing a front-line soldier; shades of John Wayne in 'The Green Berets'. What saves this film from a lower mark is director Sam Fuller's eye for a striking visual image. Particularly memorable are the shots of the dead soldier's hand and wristwatch sticking up out of the shallows off the Normandy beaches or the battered wooden crucifix which appears both in the main body of the film and in the black-and-white prologue about the sergeant's First World War experiences. (One might, in fact, ask how the crucifix has survived on the battlefield when all around has been destroyed, but this does not lessen the power of the image). These do not, however, compensate for the film's unconvincing action scenes and its inadequate characterisation. 5/10  "},{"Title":"Vignettes of the Survivors of War","Date":"9 January 2005","Score":"6 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, War","Review":" The Big Red One isn't so much a war movie as it is a message, sometimes obscure, of what war is really like.

That Lee Marvin was cast as the grizzled sergeant is part of the symbolism Marvin was a combat Marine who participated in the invasion of Saipan; he is cast as a survivor of WWI who is retracing part of the path he took during that conflict.

It's not clear why he was so eager to film this, because it adds nothing to the genre. It's long, repetitive, and full of clichés. Also working against it are unnecessary gore, superfluous narration, and a disturbing homo-erotic undertone. Did the world really need a restoration lasting nearly three hours? That is far too long for a film that essentially has no plot. It's basically a series of battle scenes punctuated by far too many facial closeups. Marvin is fine as the leader of an Army unit. Hamill is given above the title billing because of Star Wars, but is given little to do.

The characters are undeveloped cardboard cutouts and most of the action sequences ring hollow; all in a film that was made in 1980! Sam Fuller was way passed his best, not that i'm certain he was ever up to much. Just think of an action film like 'The bridges at Toko-Ri',made 26 years earlier and how much more realistic and adult it is!Now it's worth pointing out that there are several interesting sequences in this chaotic mess of a film, including the whole concentration camp scene and the scene in the insane asylum, but even these are marred by a clumsy approach. It seems to me that Fuller had a stubborn strangle hold on all aspects of the films production and this is what damages what is a promising albeit ambitious proposition. It has always seemed strange to me that a veteran should want to describe his experience of war, perhaps only an old man with emotions blunted by time could attempt this and perhaps he would have to do it in such a way as to avoid dealing with his real feelings. This may be the reason for the films curious lack of character development and emotional detachment, as well as the perverse machismo displayed, especially the scene involving the homosexual orderly in the hospital.In conclusion I think this very self conscious film tells us more about war than one might at first imagine, albeit through the distorted lens of a veteran and outdated film maker.

The difference is that a veteran of the U.S. First Division DIRECTED the film--its action is as real as he and his memories are. Lee Marvin's portrayal of the Sarge is as grim and gritty as the role requires, proof of his talent, and the film does not flinch at all from the darkest horrors of its subject. And yet, and yet, it manages to end on an uplifting note of human decency.An addition--two years ago I found and purchased the three-hour extended version on DVD, cut footage having been mercifully saved from oblivion. Be grateful this was so. There are more courses at the feast, the meal is far more rich and satisfying, the film goes from a great film to a very great film. I am doubtful that World War II will ever get a better individual treatment than that provided by the three-hour extended version of this epic.

In fact I couldn't tell you the names of the main characters, which says a lot about how much the film held my interest.In terms of the filming style, it is rather disjointed, with the action switching between various locations, and from one explosion to the next. At one point we have a ridiculous isolated scene where 3 of the soldiers are delivering a baby in a tank. Who is this woman? We don't know, never find out, and she's never seen again.I can't even recommend the acting quality, with some peripheral characters being extremely wooden, and a little painful to 'see' them acting. The ending scene at Auschwitz is woefully unconvincing, and Hamil is clearly out of his depth.Annoyingly too, the music at points was inappropriate in its style. Normally a good film soundtrack is quite unobtrusive, yet adds to the atmosphere of the film. Yet with this one, the style was sometimes glaringly irritating to me, and not really in keeping with the mood of the film.For a 2 hour 40 minute film, I expected more.

I wish there would be a place in IMDb where one could post general thinking about directors, actors, writes and the like. Since I don't know of such a place I post it here under one of his films. It could be anyone, since I saw most of them recently here in Vienna, Austria, where the local film museum shows this month all of his films!Fighting is quite the right title, since most of Sam Fullers films show individuals or groups fighting for survival in one or the other form. Therefor I think it only right to fight for him. He did a lot of war films about WWII or Korea like Merrill's Marauders, The Big Red One Steel Helmet and Fixed Bajonetts. Although the term anti-war movie was not applied to these films when they came out, they show much more about the horrors of war than many outspoken anti-war films. His own experiences as a soldier in WWII make them so haunting. Beside the very realistic action scenes his war films show a lot about the life and fears of soldiers in war. And his soldiers are always human beings, almost humble men, even after a lot of fighting experience. There is never much hatred for the enemy, just the wish to survive. His films, especially The Big Red One belong in a row with Apocalypse Now and The Thin Red Line!Many of his other films are about very personal fights like Underworld USA where the leading person is so deeply hurt by injustice, that this person can not live a normal life anymore. (It is quite possible that this film inspired Akira Kurosawa to do The Bad Sleep Well.) The injustice can be a very personal point of view, like in The Run of the Arrow, still Fuller respects this view and gives the person ample time to review it. Some of his protagonists are just fighting for survival in and outside the law, as seen in I shot Jesse James, The Baron of Arizona, Pickup on South Street and The Naked Kiss.There is an attitude among his hero's with is very singular. They are more or less open for other cultures. They do not belittle their habits or rules, instead try to understand and live by it. (See Run of the Arrow and House of Bamboo. In both films the leading men try to learn the language as well as the customs of the natives.) Racism is addressed in almost every of Sam Fuller's films!When someone in his films is driven by some form of greed, they are doomed, like the lieutenant in Run of the Arrow or the reporter in Shock Corridor. They undervalue their opponents or obstacles. Although his main characters are often acting out of anger or other strong feelings Fuller emphasizes the importance of sensibility in the things we are doing if we want to do things right. His films try to be as honest as possible and most of the time they are!

A group of friends having a whale of a time on holiday in Europe during WWII. I know that sounds ridiculous but thats how the movie feels. The starkness and harsh reality of war is not what you see in this movie, war almost seems like fun. Of course not for the minor characters who keep ending up dead but for the principal characters it is all just a laugh.The dialogues is terrible and full of clichés. I know many war movies are riddled with clichés but its not just that. The dialogues is just absurd at times. And all the characters are just walking clichés, especially the European characters. The Italians are typically over the top. Children and old grandmothers are sweet and innocent. These are just a couple of examples.All the sub-plots in the film are completely ridiculous. Children for some reason seem to be attracted to Lee Marvin's character like he is the kiddy snatcher from chitty chitty bang bang bearing gifts of sweeties. Germans fall out of line by telling their commanding officers how much they hate Hitler until their predictable execution. The whole ridiculous birth scene inside a tank is done in very bad taste. Then you have a young Hitler youth who has killed some American G.I's and then has his trousers pulled down and spanked.The beach scene when the Americans arrive in North Africa is probably the most ridiculous scene I have ever seen in a war movie. They start off fighting the French Vichy soldiers and as soon as the Vichy commander is killed the french troops surrender and then run over to embrace the Americans.As you have seen I have mostly just tried to state things as they actually happen and not give my personal opinion. You don't need to give opinions to show how absurd this film is, just stating what happens illustrates enough.Also there seem to be many homosexual innuendos in the film. Nothing wrong with that but they are very bizarre. I could go on and on here, I could talk about the terrible acting, the stupid plot and the historical inaccuracies but I will save it.If you like to hear things go BANG ! and see a bit of blood and guts then this is the movie for you.

Mark Hammill in a post Star Wars role plays Griff who is an unerringly good shot until seeing the horrors on the TORCH beaches turns him 'yellow bellied.' I was disappointed by the way it seemed to be haphazard editing wise and was surprised and pleased when the Reconstruction came out. The missing 47 minutes make this movie and make it as firmer and as emotional as before. Forget the cheap budget this film worked on and forget the fact it used Ireland and Israel for locations, focus on the men who gradually form a close knit bond and survive from Operation Torch right to VE Day. Most emotional I found was when Lee Marvin is carrying the young boy around after the extermination camp, and when the boy slumps over silently how Marvin carries on walking it is hard not to feel tears. But the Big Red One is intermixed with dashes of humour. Such as the scene where Zab is trying to explain to the Belgian landlady that he wants a woman with a big rear end to rub it against a frosty window because he's trying to honour the late Kaiser's wishes and ends up saying.

I've never seen the abbreviated version, and I don't intend to, so this review only applies to the new version. From what I hear, it is very very different. The German characters play more of a part, the sounds have been ramped nearly up to Fuller's preferred level of live ammunition in the theater.This is truly a war film. It's got many of the same scenes that were later copied in films such as Schindler's List (where a Nazi tries to fire twice but his gun misfires each time and he gives up), a scene similar to the one in Stalingrad where soldiers hide in holes while tanks go over their heads an then attack from behind, and the D-Day assault where the men have to blow a hole through the tank trap the hard way, copied by Saving Private Ryan. However, the scenes here don't have nice tidy endings. The characters here were a prototype of the ones in SPR the father figure, the writer, the sniper, the first generation Euro-American (in SPR it was a Jew, here an Italian), and one other guy, who is like a real person in BRO, but in SPR was just a two-dimensional imperturbable bad-ass (Tom Sizemore, who incidentally played a carbon copy of that character in Black Hawk Down. An unimaginative casting agent. Why not just have him suck bullets out of his wounds and spit them out with a p-ting!).This is Sam Fuller's story, partly autobiographical, as the movie says, Fictional life based on factual death. It's the best tag-line for the film. Compare to SPR's satisfied The Mission is a Man, which was obviously not something thought up by a WWII veteran. Fuller wanted to make a non-heroic, non-sentimental war movie, which is how he saw the war, and he did. Unfortunately Spielberg, whom I have a lot of respect for, made basically the opposite film with SPR. The BRO spends time in Africa fighting Rommel, Sicily, D-Day, Belgium, and finally assaulting a concentration camp in Germany, following four characters in a platoon and their older, calmer sergeant, who is a veteran of WWI as well. Like SPR focused on Captain Miller, played by Tom Hanks, The BROfocuses on the sergeant, played by Lee Marvin. Tom Hanks is a handsome, nice leading man, he looks as if he's never fired a gun in his life (I mean he played the same sweet bachelor in Joe v. the Volcano, You've Got Mail, and Sleepless in Seattle). Lee Marvin looks more like a military man, scarred, asymmetrical face, and in fact was a combat veteran of WWII. I don't get the feeling most infantry came out of WWII feeling like Private Ryan did, I get the feeling they came out feeling like Sam Fuller and Lee Marvin did.Also here there is one German focused on, Schroeder, who is barely a shadow in the older cut version, and the Germans are portrayed as pretty evil guys, but not cartoon villains like in SPR where to them, one good turn deserves a stick in the ribs. The American characters reflect, not on why they're there (why bother this late), but on what they're going to do about it. They drink, they smoke, they swear, they say cock and pussy but not gratuitously, more spontaneously. SPR was totally sanitized (FUBAR.) The only part in SPR that even hints about fornication is something Private Ryan tells about his brother before the war opting to not lose his virginity before he ships out. I'm sorry, but if you want to see the life soldiers really live and what they talk about, you can't bring your kids, and you might not like what you see, it's not like life in peacetime.Now I know there's a lot of people, like me, who watch war films for the gratuitous battle scenes. It sounds like the original cut version was lacking, but this one isn't. One reviewer on IMDb compared the tone to Ballad of the Green Berets. Not the reconstructed version, at all. It's damned loud, it's scary, and the ambient artillery explosions, gunshots, ricochets keep you on edge. There's an incredible scene where men on horseback are charging through a gunfight, which was left out of the original entirely. The German tanks they meet in Africa are menacing. The D-Day assault is equal to SPR in this version. It doesn't have the special effects wizardry that Spielberg could do in 1998, or the experimental photography of hand cameras, but it's just as chaotic, terrifying, and you get the same sense of arbitrary death where people are lucky one second and dead the next. Very intense, which you might expect from a director who lived through WWII. It may be a bit dated, but not nearly as much as you'd think.The movie is much less preachy and philosophical than SPR, but not nearly as bleak and nihilistic as the Thin Red Line or Stalingrad. It' seems conventional because it's reminiscent of so many heroic sentimental war films that came after it, but it is really groundbreaking and unconventional in its intensity and realistic tone. The characters are not smart, not idiots, they're the kind of people you'd imagine who were drafted out of high school but are wising up quickly out of necessity. Basically, it's just a good story. I'd say that it was second only to Das Boot as a WWII movie, out of all the ones I've seen (and I'm only counting real war movies, not action or romances that happened in WWII like U-571 or Pearl Harbor, which are not even worth comparing).

While the D-Day scenes are not a sensationally effective as in Private Ryan, the emotional impact of knowing the players is much more psychologically interesting.

It's also one of the best war pictures ever made.The Big Red One is a product of the personal vision of director Samuel Fuller and his experiences in World War II. In the film, Fuller's character is played by Robert Carradine who narrates the film. Carradine is one of four soldiers, the others being Mark Hamill, Bobby DiCicco, and Kelly Ward. The four of them are part of a rifle squad and were together from the landings in Morocco against the Vichy French through North Africa, Sicily, and the European Theater until V.E. Day.The sergeant of this squadron is Lee Marvin, every inch the professional soldier. I'm sure it helped that in World War II, Marvin did serve in the Marines in the Pacific theater and had the role of sergeant down perfectly due to his life experience. He really does become the experienced non-commissioned officer who shepherds the young soldiers of our greatest generation through war.These guys are not heroes by any means, but they are doing a necessary job and being led by the best when it comes to their survival.My favorite scenes are when the U.S. Army's First Division liberates a concentration camp in Czechoslovakia towards the end of the war. The young men of the squadron see the reason for their trip overseas up close and personal. Particularly touching is the dialogless scenes involving a young boy with Lee Marvin. The boy and Marvin's expression say more than all the talk any writer could have given them. It's what movies are all about.Mark Hamill straight from his iconic role as Luke Skywalker in the original Star Wars gets billing second to Marvin. His performance is good, but it doesn't stand out from the others. My guess is he was contracted to do this before Star Wars was out and the success of Star Wars mandated elevated billing for Hamill.The Big Red One is one of the best war films ever done. It will be an enduring classic and actually should be viewed in classrooms for the young of every subsequent generation who want to know what the European theater of World War II was all about. And it is an absolute must see for fans of Lee Marvin.

The film has the feel of a 1940s war picture, making little use of advances in direction, technology and filming options that developed in the interim. THE BIG RED ONE has certainly not aged well.On the plus side, there are some good battle scenes. At one point the men are forced to take cover in hastily-dug holes while a massive battle tank rolls over their heads. A later scene supplies suspense as the greatly-outnumbered boys hide out in a cave, hoping beyond hope the enemy won't turn them into cannon fodder. And our star delivers a quintessential Lee Marvin performance, displaying a I've seen it all before level of perseverance.THE BIG RED ONE doesn't hold a candle to great war pictures of the past and present.

First off, as many have said, this film tries way way way too hard to be meaningful and poetic. It falls flat on its face looking very cheap and cliché. The movie is directed like it is an episode of C.H.I.Ps. There is so much winking at the camera and being tongue in cheek. The so called humor also is unbelievably stupid. The acting was very bad and it was terribly casted(Lee Marvin was at least bearable). None of the characters were interesting and the storyline was so disconnected since the movie just appears like a bunch of separate vignettes. Back to the directing, it is shot like a 60s film(I have nothing against 60s movies) and it just does not fit the script, which is wretched, and this movie could have worked better as a 30 second Go Army ad on the TV. The ending of this movie relates to my titling of the summary. When Lee Marvin liberates the concentration camp, he comes across a dying young boy and carries him on his shouldered. We slowly see the boy keeling over as her dies on Lee Marvin's shoulders as he walks on. This could have been a GREAT and touching scene, but then of course we get cut off by Robert Carradine's annoying narration and the rest of the scene gets cut to the crappy storyline. The other parts of the liberation are done so poorly that let's just say the victims of this terrible war would be rolling over in their graves.

I know there are worse war movies out there (or so-called war movies; these types are so bad they should be reclassified as comedies), even of the serious variety (i.e., those with such pretensions anyway)...but this movie's just cheesey.It's not as shamefully and blatantly super-patriotic and simple-minded like Saving Private Ryan, but the dumb war-as-personal-growth-experience ethos is still the defining theme of the movie.  I could could just go on and on about how absurd The Big Red One is, but here are a few which I remember off the top of my head* This is supposed to be a serious war movie (not like Rambo or some Chuck Norris BS), and one based on the director Sam Fuller's real-life experiences, ostensibly, but how in hell do these boys go through combat behind enemy lines talking so much??  Real soldiers don't yap like that -- if they did, they wouldn't have lived to talk about it.  I kept wishing for some Nazi to shoot these talking heads already.  The dialogue is just so banal and corny and cheesey in any case.* The German tanks used in the movie ARE NOT German tanks!  They're American M4 Shermans, painted gray and given the German cross identification marker on their turrets.  At least the almost equally laughable Saving Private Ryan got the tanks right!  Talk about insulting the viewer's intelligence! And tank/infantry tactics are definitely not portrayed accurately at all!* The Germans are just so stupid, aren't they, lining up to get shot by these good ol' boys, passing off a RECYCLED AMERICAN TANK as a German 88 AA/AT gun, and just not knowing how to return accurate fire at close ranges!* War-ravaged Italian paisans have the wherewithal to do an al fresco luncheon for the good ol' boys?  Hello!* Really, everything is just so predictable about this film, nothing surprises you -- right down to the cheap one-liners and comebacks.  This film is more like a comic book -- actually, I think the old '70s DC Comics Sgt. Rock is more realistic!This film just feels so lame.  For a much better serious war film (though none is perfect, admittedly), try Sam Peck's Cross of Iron -- but DO NOT get the Region 1 Hen's Tooth DVD version, which is terribly done; screen the Region 2 French (with English dub) version instead!The Big Red One is Saving Private Ryan without any of the special effects or modern action and pacing which made the latter at least marginally redeemable.  The Big Red One is in the bargain bin of K-Mart for a reason.Put it this way -- I ain't no genius, but even as an eleven-year old I didn't like this movie.  Now, as an adult, I'm reminded why all over again. Again, not total schlock like Plan 9 from Outer Space or something like that, but it falls quite short of its own apparent goal of being a gritty no-nonsense recollection of late WW II Western Front combat.  Too many best of times, worst of times conventions employed here.  The actors seem fine in their roles, and I was especially impressed with Mark Hamill, though Lee Marvin did a very good job as many others here have noted...but something's defintely missing overall even without all my whining.  Sure I can cut a film some slack, but when it is supposed to be serious, for real, and not just some popcorn crowd shoot-em-up, then the bar's much higher -- and this movie falls rather too short of its own mark.I'm actually so frustrated because I do sense that this movie could have been really great.

For the most part, it's an ensemble film, a band-of-brothers story in war movie terms. The characters are all huddled together within the film's cocksure focus. But the movie opens with Marvin at the end of the First World War. The end of the second one is a consummation of his chivalrous sense of heroism.What makes Sam Fuller's baby suffer is its scoff-worthy abundance of extensive hero worship. It's about the four privates who survive the war from beginning to end with their sergeant, Marvin, becoming known as the Four Horsemen. The body of the movie comprises a stream of episodes showcasing, dramatizing, often even surrealistically symbolizing the aberration and atrocity of war. The cigar-chomping, squinty-eyed, teeth-gnashing, emotionally impenetrable squad fights in so many places, stays together intact for so long, experiences so many of the decisive advents of WWII that naturally these characters are meant to signify all the infantrymen in all the battles. Fuller, however, who fought in the First Division, appears determined to keep his representations from evolving any thematic illuminations. They fight. They are scared. Men kill, other men are killed.This conserves a consciously intermittent construction for the film. One battle ends, another begins. What we have is a sequential scrapbook of experiences so devastating that the characters can't find reason or interrelation in them, and so merely try to survive them through being infallible in their expertise and invincible to ordeal. Is this all Fuller drew from of the war? He gives the impression that he believes it's all anybody really gets, that the vast patterns of war's meaning are really just the creations of thinkers, storytellers and politicians, and that for the guy under fire there is no pattern, just the desperately sincere desire to live.This is a theme that would indeed be more persuasive were our four heroes not constantly put on a man's man pedestal with scenes of the pure sort of braggadocio many older men show when they pontificate on the old days. The Big Red One is a good entertainment, it does impart insight into historical niceties of WWI and WWII, it does portray intense peril in a good deal of its grounded battle sequences. It just doesn't always tell the truth. "},{"Title":"Fuller cannot much direct action, but his study and sense of awareness for the subject matter shines through rather brightly.","Date":"20 April 2009","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, War","Review":" I do think The Big Red One is a good war film, perhaps not a great one because of its sporadic nature in an attempt to get across a broad and epic sense of war due to it covering two different theatres of operations and a further two different fronts within one theatres during World War Two, but it's focused and dramatic and it makes a good study of the individual in the war-zone. The film's approach, interestingly, has us see the film through one pair of eyes in American soldier Private Zab (Carradine), an observant and would-be author who is constantly looking for material for his new book, but our attention is drawn to the battle wary Sergeant, simply named 'The Sergeant' and played with the sort of no-nonsense gusto Lee Marvin has evoked in the past in such films as Point Blank. The Sergeant is a veteran from the First World War, during which the film opens with him killing a German soldier despite the war having already ended. Alas, he wasn't to know the point is raised that it could be seen as murdering a fellow man, despite him being the enemy mere hours ago.And that's from whence the film's primary study arises; an asking of why soldiers are doing what they're doing and whether killing is justified when you're at war with someone else. You do not murder a fellow human being at times of war, you merely kill the enemy. Later on, the film will pause for thought when the American platoon we follow discover a Nazi Concentration Camp and I think they sort of begin to realise that a lot of killing took place at this other camps like this, raising the issue they've lived on for the entire campaign of whether all the killing is justified in war. It's at these camps, of course, that so many innocents were rid of the world by the Germans and that quite simply has to be murder, but to the Nazis, they were enemies that needed to be killed. So it's all about what the individual believes and that echos the study the film makes. One of the more powerful scenes in the film is when an American soldier continues to fire into a dead German soldier after having foiled his ambush. I don't think the American knows what to think anymore, about the war or the philosophy about killing/murder, and just keeps doing what 'the soldier' knows to do fire a rifle into those they're told to do so at. Like a machine, he just plugs away &#x96; shocked, confused and very disturbed.But my general gripe is that the film hops around Europe too much, encompassing so many backdrops and theatres and situations; particularly when the film rather bizarrely jumps to D-Day in France in 1944 from operations in Italy and North Africa and then onto that Concentration Camp. Any war film leaping about from Africa, to Operation Overlord to a Death Camp is clearly trying to get across a sense of scale but do we really need this when the study is about a close knit bunch of soldiers and the issues they raise amongst one another &#x96; such an intimate study between people at such a time does not need to have a large backdrop overwhelm it. The film would've still worked without most of the D-Day and North Africa set action.But another positive aspect of the film that is quite clearly evident is in regards to the close knit bond the soldiers have as they work their way through the war. It lies within the approach director Samuel Fuller takes - the sense we get during the scenes of war and just prior to them. This is not a war film focusing on bloody action as much as it is the drive to commit the bloody action. The scenes just prior to the warfare are so much better than the warfare themselves. The occasions during which the platoon are hiding, or observing, are fantastic. One occasion sees them in a cave as a German tank division rumbles past, now and again an enemy troop will come in for whatever reason and they must eliminate them. There is a high risk factor and it's toyed with at various points before scenes of action. There are additional scenes later on during which the platoon must dig in under a tank division and French troops are unsure whether to open fire on incoming Americans. These scenes prolong anxiety in the sense they can be so close to both death and victory at the same time and act as some of the best scenes in the film.If the D-Day sequence does serve a purpose, it's to simply highlight the ridiculousness of war when one after another, American troops are being called up and forced to crawl to their doom as they attempt to deliver some Bangalores. It's a hopeless and desperate situation, a casual disregard of human life as individuals are labelled mere digits and sent off by that number to their death. But the film holds firm and is generally really well directed by Fuller. He cannot direct action too well, but his suspense in certain scenes, his ideas and the overall study are most definitely there; for added realism and focus, it even takes the platoon two attempts to destroy an enemy vehicle with a grenade because the first doesn't go right. I read after seeing the film that director Fuller based the film on a few of his personal experiences during the war, bringing a very personalised tone to the film which he gets across. The film begins with an eerie image of Jesus Christ witnessing the aftermath of war and a 'murder' taking place, but we end overall on a positive note &#x96; the same mistake made again, but with an renowned sense of optimism this time.

About the press in Park Row, about pulpy crime stories like those he wrote in Crimson Kimono, about war in a dozen of his movies. The Big Red One may be the most personal of all because he fought with the actual Big Red One in WWII. Those who have a passing knowledge of Fuller's persona will recognize him in Pvt Zab chewing down the end of a cigar throughout the movie. Sam Fuller himself appears as a newsreel cameraman later on. Lee Marvin, aged though he may have been for his role, was another WWII veteran and he was shot in the Pacific in much the same way he's shot in the movie. Now all the jigsaw pieces start coming together to reveal what kind of movie this is.If it appears a bit anachronistic for its time, in its bland score and vivid bright colors that seem to have escaped from a 60's movie, two years later than Apocalypse Now, five years before Full Metal Jacket, that's because it is. It's not a movie made by young people and it doesn't set out to deconstruct the war movie or search for the primeval archetype behind war the way Coppola did in the jungles of the Philippines. It's wholesome in its own episodic way, a journey of sorts that takes us from the deserts of Algeria to the landings in Sicily and Omaha beach to the heart of the beast, the crematoriums of Germany. In its own syncopated way, this is no less a journey to the heart of darkness than Apocalypse Now was. The conclusion is not mystical but it's full of raw humanity. The scope is broad (WWII in all the different battlefields of Europe) but the focus is narrow (on a small company of four young bucks and their scruffy sergeant who's haunted by demons he first encountered in a WWI battlefield). In all the various set pieces we're taken through the emphasis remains on the nailbiting buildup, the suspense and the constant waiting to kill or be killed by a stray nameless bullet, rather than a panoramic outcome of a war won or lost. Indeed, when the war ends, the soldiers only find out about it through flyers dropped from the sky, some of them even too late. Fuller experienced war firsthand and he knows war is more about constant nerve-wracking waiting than spectacular action. Being a director of the old brigade of course he stuffs the movie full of everything. Action and humor, drama and suspense, all side by side yet nothing feels misplaced or redundant, even the raid on an insane asylum takes a curious poignant turn by the end when an inmate grabs a semi-automatic and starts firing wildly at the walls yelling I am sane now. The question the movie asks is simple enough is war cold blooded murder or a form of killing necessitated by some kind of design and how far is one from the other? And even though we never become as intimate with the small group of soldiers as we do with the privates in the PBR boat in Apocalypse Now or the platoon in the boot camp of Full Metal Jacket, by the end, when a private discovers a Nazi soldier hiding inside a crematorium and Lee Marvin's sergeant takes care of a Jewish child survivor of some concentration camp, the movie emerges as poignant an indictment on the madness and despair of war as any that came before or after. Fuller made several great war movies (The Steel Helmet and Fixed Bayonets! best among them), but this may very well be his masterpiece.

The battles, and the rests between battles, takes us from North Africa, through Sicily, France, and Czechoslovakia. We see the entire war through the eyes of this small group because Fuller was operating on a budget of something like four million dollars. It's as close to an epic as Fuller was to come, but the budget shows. This is no Saving Private Ryan. I'm taking a couple of things into account -- not just the budget but the effort and care that Fuller put into it. It's by far his most personal film. Carradine plays Zap, a reporter who is a stand in for Fuller, and Fuller himself appears as a war correspondent.It's an episodic movie, as many war movies are, but if there's one feature of this film that's consistent, it's its inconsistency. When somebody dies, there are no tears, no eulogy, no remembrance of him later. Instead, there's a quick cut to a party. Death comes out of nowhere, both for the Americans and the Germans. Pause to take a leak and you get your throat cut. (That's how Fuller would have put it.) There are a couple of memorable moments, small ones that don't involve a lot of action. Halfway through the film, the reporter and writer, Zap, notices a replacement reading a novel that Zap has just had published. Inching his face close to the replacement's, Zap says, That's my book. YOUR book? I just bought it at the repo depo. Yeah, but I wrote it, Zap tells him, then gives him a swig from a bottle of booze and claps him on the cheek. Marvin has been lounging nearby, his helmet over his face, and when he overhears this exchange he surreptitiously tilts his helmet back to stare wonderingly at Zap for a moment before allowing the helmet to drop again. He didn't know Zap was a writer, and no power on earth could ever get Marvin to compliment him on having a novel published. There isn't space enough to describe more, but most of them revolve around the utter absence of sentiment. Well -- one more. It lasts about a minute. It's just a scene in which a matronly hotel manager sits at an old piano and plays a bit of Chopin, while Marvin sits on the end of the bench, looking away from her, dreamily, and neither speaks a word. For those few seconds we're able to get far enough into Marvin's head to get past his identity as a soldier. But there are other recurring elements that Fuller makes good use of. The kids, for instance. The children. First we meet Arab kids who are conniving scamps. Then we meet Italian kids, the boys tough (one of them shows no emotion when he's arguing with the men that the decomposing body of his mother must be buried in a proper place), the girls sweet (one of them weaves flowers into the netting of Marvin's helmet). The German kids who are still saluting Hitler and sniping at the advancing GIs.We also get to meet Lee Marvin's German counterpart, a sergeant played by Siegried Rauch, who was the intelligence officer assigned to research the personal characteristics of General Patton in Patton. Well, ALL the Germans we anything but lovable. But Rauch is an uncomplicated Nazi. He's brave, resolute, and brutal. If someone bad mouths Hitler or the cause, Rauch simply machine-guns them to death. It doesn't matter if the victim is just a poor disgruntled grunt or a contessa. Rat-a-tat-tat. And when Rauch finally surrenders, it's just so that he can live long enough to carry on the fight later.That's kind of a simple-minded view of an enemy, never mind another human being. And the film, its strengths notwithstanding, suffers from this simplicity in its dialog and characterization. On a French battlefield, the men stumble across a monument to the First Infantry Division, with a long list of names. One of them says, Look at that! We just got here and already they put up a monument to the Big Red One. Marvin explains that the monument was put up in 1918 after the First World War. But the names are the same, remarks the kid. They always are, replies Marvin.Well, Fuller fought with the Big Red One through Europe. He's been there. And yet incidents like this sound fraudulent. The event itself is improbable, and the dialog could have come from a 1950s comic book.There's another problem with the film. Lee Marvin and a couple of foreign professionals aside, nobody in it can act. Some are positively embarrassing. The four young privates that Marvin manages to shepherd through the war may, from time to time, utter a believable line of dialog or come up with an endearing and appropriate expression, but none looks or sounds right for the role.I don't like tearing this film apart because I liked Sam Fuller's character, but he's made a much better war movie than this -- Merrill's Marauders. The Big Red One doesn't linger on anything for long and what character development there is, is predictable from almost the beginning. (Griff learns to shoot a man. Lee's sergeant lays the ghost of a murder from the previous war.) If you want to see a movie that stands almost in direct opposition to this one, take another look at Terence Malick's The Thin Red Line. It's slow. It's languorous. It's poetic -- too poetic at times. The battle scenes can make a viewer shiver with fear. The enemy, although strictly an obstacle to be overcome, isn't stereotyped.

"},{"Title":"Fuller rocks","Date":"18 September 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, War","Review":" Having seen the original version of Sam Fuller's The Big Red One, years ago, on television, I could see glimmers of something far grander, but did not know what it could be, and given the callowness of my youth, even had I known what was missing, I could not have mentally interpolated back what the studio that financed the film, Lorimar, had cut. Fuller was basically a B film auteur, having made his reputation on 1950s and 1960s B war films (The Steel Helmet, Merrill's Marauders), and the famous- or infamous, Shock Corridor, yet The Big Red One, which was a fictionalization of his real World War Two experiences with the First Infantry Division of the U.S. Army, was, even in its bowdlerized version, considered his masterpiece. And it's a good solid war film. However, The Reconstruction version, adding in over forty-seven minutes on this two disk DVD version, is a truly great war film, and ranks only below Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line and Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now as the greatest war film ever made. I would rank it with Regeneration, Patton, and Full Metal Jacket as the head of the next tier of war films. However, unlike Coppola's expanded Apocalypse Now Redux DVD version, with its questionable reinstatement of some bloated and unnecessary scenes, all of the restored scenes in the restored version of Fuller's film only enhance this film's narrative and characterization.The tale is straightforward, and told from a GI's perspective, rather than from some omniscient eye in the sky. It is lean, filled with little moments, shorn of much visual poesy, yet, despite that, it is very poetic, albeit in totally different ways than the films of Malick and Coppola, which were self-conscious art films, in the best sense of the word. As in all of Fuller's war films, we know these men from just a few brushstrokes, but they are not stereotypes, like the ridiculously banal grunts in Steven Spielberg's ridiculous schlocksterpiece Saving Private Ryan. The main characters are five Americans and one German. The leader of the Americans is an unnamed sergeant (although he is sometimes called Possum) who starts the film, and ends World War One, killing a surrendering German soldier with his knife, four hours after the Armistice, and the violation of that code of war haunts him ever after. The scene, shot in black and white, and highlighted by a shell-shocked horse's attack on Marvin, under a large crucifix, is beautifully wrought, acted, and written, and sets the film's tone about the enduring irrationality and absurdity of war without having to delve into comedy like M*A*S*H or Catch-22 do&#133;. All of this, plus the eye level view of a grunt, make this film something special. And, unlike Oliver Stone, Fuller does not need to wave his political banner in a viewer's face. Also, Lee Marvin is simply fantastic- this is his greatest role, and he should have won an Oscar for it, even though Hollywood would never honor a man like Fuller. Compared to Tom Hanks' sergeant in Spielberg's garbage, Marvin's is the kind of man men would follow into battle, and die for. The reconstructed film opens with the quote, 'This is fictional life based on factual death,' and ends with an epitaph for Fuller. Never has a film's epigraph been more on target, nor more poignant. The Big Red One The Reconstruction will be de rigueur viewing for war film buffs as long as films are watched. Who needs an Oscar with that sort of legacy?

It embraces such dialog as, We don't murder, we kill--you do not murder meat you eat, and Killing insane people is poor for public relations... killing sane people is okay. Also, if it's any worth to you, Samuel Fuller is a WWII veteran and this movie comes out of some of his personal experience.However, one regrettable thing about this film, an aspect that is admittedly entirely out of its control, is the fact that it sags under the weight of so many other war films out there. I cannot speak of the unseen movie that Fuller intended--perhaps that version would stand out more. What I can say is that it's extant version basically fits so smoothly into its history its almost invisible everything it does has been done both before and since. There is really nothing in this movie that stands out. Even the scenes in the insane asylum match similar scenes in an earlier film called King of Hearts, and the whole thing on Normandy beach involving the watch was subsequently taken by Spielberg in Saving Private Ryan. The biggest reason for this is straight-forward studio control turned it from a personal essay of a person's experiences of war into a salable genre creation. It is no longer Samuel Fuller's film, it is a WWII film. Until (and if) Fuller's original intention comes out, The Big Red One basically exists as that other movie with Mark Hamill in it. --PolarisDiB "}{"Title":"A final masterpiece from one of the most underrated and fascinating American auteurs","Date":"20 January 2008","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, War","Review":" I'm not a huge fan of war pictures as most of them are oversimplified and make war itself look fun and exciting (or they can take the opposite direction and shove down equally simple messages about the horrors of war). Fortunately, The Big Red One doesn't fall into either of those categories. Maybe its the fact it was directed by Samuel Fuller, a real life combat veteran, but it presents war in the way I'd imagine it to really be like. Despite some nice absurd, almost surreal moments one can expect from Fuller, its for the most part a seemingly accurate depiction of the European campaign by the Allied forces. Plus, there's a human interest element - this is as much a character study and exploration of human interactions as it is a war film.The direction and writing by Fuller are both very good. His screenplay is full of literary dialog that some may see as being over-the-top, but I think it adds a nice sense of poetry to the proceedings. Its also very well paced, not to quick and not too slow. His direction is very skilled as well. The film, despite its long length, is constantly engrossing. The only real minor quibble I have with it is the fact that the Germans and French speak in English. This was fine back in the 50s, but now it seems a tad silly. Additionally, the fact that when the foreigners interact with the Americans they speak in their native language makes it a bit goofy. This is the only real issue I have with the film, and ultimately it doesn't detract from the final power.The acting is very good as well. Lee Marvin is a commanding screen presence as always, and while this may not be my personal favorite role from him (that'd be Point Blank), its possibly his most nuanced and mannered. It shows he was a terrific actor in addition to an icon. The privates in his squad are good with the exception of Mark Hamill - he was always a dull actor, which is the reason why his career never took off despite the mammoth success of Star Wars. Despite a few minor imperfections, The Big Red One really is a masterpiece.

So despite the fact that we don't see all that much equipment or even costumed extras in any of the battle scenes, this film doesn't look cheap to my eyes. In fact there's quite a lot of visual beauty here, and I enjoyed the sort of homage to David Lean in the scene where The Sergeant (Lee Marvin&#133; and yes, he's known only as The Sarge to his troops) stomps onto a French beach in full Arab gear like Lawrence coming out of the desert into Cairo.The film only really runs into trouble when it comes to the fine balancing act that the director Sam Fuller is attempting between realism and absurdity. It's admirable that Fuller's soldiers have not lost either their sense of humor or their libidos. Instead of attempting a large narrative thread, the film is based on a series of vignettes taking place at various points in the European front of WWII. The movie is at its best when including some small details from soldier life, most probably true considering that writer/director Fuller was himself a veteran of the First Infantry which is the subject of this film. I laughed when the soldiers placed condoms on their rifles to keep them dry in the Normandy landing, and when they stuck rolls of toilet paper in the water as a decoy for enemy fire. Those details feel like the kind of odd situations that might actually have happened. And certainly I don't think it's irreverent or disrespectful to show the soldiers joking around, even about the dead. Most war movies just ignore the coincidence of their protagonists' survival at the expense of others. Here it's made into a disarmingly morbid running joke. However, it becomes difficult at times to tell which details are realistic or accurate and which are hyperbole. The raid on the asylum is particularly problematic; it gave me flashbacks to Shock Corridor by Fuller, a film that I felt was ridiculous in its portrayal of the mentally ill. Here we have laughable scenes of retards (the film is consistent in its unflinching embrace of politically incorrect terms like retard, Kraut, etc.) sitting in a room with a dozen rifles going off and seeming to take absolutely no notice. Unless they're supposed to be deaf as well as mentally challenged, this scene deserves at least some of the derision heaped upon it over the years. Also there is the assassin who dances among the Germans and kills them without anyone noticing&#133;. It's a memorable and bizarre scene, but stuff like this really clashes with other parts of the film that feel almost documentarian.It's kind of a surprise to me that so many others complained about the realism of the film in their comments. If you demand that a film shows actual German tanks instead of American tanks painted with German symbols then maybe you should watch a documentary instead of a fictional movie. I guess people have seen so many war movies by big-name people like Spielberg nowadays that it's hard to use your imagination and to realize that it's possible to tell a war story without showing 1000 tanks and 100,000 soldiers with CGI in a huge battlefield. War stories should be about individual people anyway; otherwise they are just exploitation action films using the war as an excuse for vicarious violence. This film on the other hand reminded me of one of my favorite war movies, Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket (which was probably influenced by this film, actually) &#150; the focus is consistently on the characters and not the action itself, and the film's anti-climax is a deliberate artistic choice to emphasize that war isn't heroic or enjoyable. The only glory in war is survival, as this not-so-subtle film concludes. It's not so much an exhortation or a motto as it is a statement of a brutal fact, fitting for this film's particular brand of bitter triumphalism.A final note on some of the performances &#150; Lee Marvin always adds something to any film he appears in, and when he's in a good film like this he always gives a good performance. No exceptions here. I particularly enjoyed how he played his scenes with Mark Hamill, who plays a pacifist whose compatriots think is a coward. Marvin is great at playing these types who are completely straight and deadly serious but who very occasionally show signs of eccentricity that make the character believable. Hamill does good work, throwing himself completely into the role and reminding us what an exciting actor he can be. Carradine also does good work as Fuller's stand-in, toting a pad and pen and a cigar.

Remarkable for a war film in that it simultaneously reveals the commonality of the soldier's lot while refusing to fall into the trap of suggesting that neither side is right or wrong. We are left with no doubt that the Big Red One fought on the side of righteousness when we witness the scenes of the death camp liberation in Czechoslovakia. Although the narrating soldier downplays the accomplishments of he and his comrades at the end, the entire feeling of the film is one, not of waste and futility, but of sacrifice and gratitude at having survived. Looming over it all is that wooden Christ without eyes, as if not wishing to see the carnage of a world seemingly forsaken by God.

Traditional this sub-genre contains three basic elements hero, group, and objective. The group is made up of a mixture of ethnic types, most commonly including an Italian, a Jew, a cynical complainer from Brooklyn, a sharpshooter from the mountains, a Midwesterner (nicknamed by his state, Iowa or Dakota for example), and a character who must be initiated in some way (a newcomer without battle experience) and/or who will provide a commentary or explanation on the action as it occurs (a newspaperman, a letter writer, an author, a professor). As the group moves forward, action unfolds in a series of contrasting episodes that alternate in uneven patterns night and day, safety and danger, action and relaxation, dialogue and non-dialogue, comedy and tragedy, good weather and bad weather, combat and non-combat, and so on. Military iconography is used and explained, conflicts break out within the group (in which the objective, leadership and war itself is questioned), rituals from home are discussed and remembered and new combat rituals are enacted. As the group advances, they encounter the enemy and certain members die. A final climactic battle, often a last stand referred to as an Alamo, takes place at a bridge or in a town, and reveals the film's overall purpose. The hero or narrator, who has usually had the objective forced on him, then has to make a series of difficult (and unpopular) decisions. He sometimes survives (although most of his men don't), and he sometimes dies. These films were common in the 40s and 50s, and rarely deviated from this formula. The genre remained silent for a number of years, thanks mostly to the Vietnam war, before two films reactivated it briefly in the 80s and 90s Sam Fuller's Big Red One and Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan.Fuller's film, which eschews realism at times for a more metaphysical outlook, and which revokes corny moralising in favour for stoic silence, has been criticised by some for being fake. Filmed on a minuscule budget (1/25th the budget of Private Ryan) and without the benefits of modern technology, viewers dismiss it as a dated movie. But with repeated viewings (and an extended cut released recently) the film reveals a maturity, an immediacy, a sort of no-nonsense authenticity, that most platoon films lack. Indeed, of all WW2 platoon movies, from Bataan to Guadalcanal Diary to Objective Burma to Saving Private Ryan, the trio of The Big Red One, Beach Red and The Thin Red Line are arguably the best, not because of their realism, but because of their metaphysical trimmings. But when people complain that old war films are not realistic, what do they really mean? When Bataan was released (the first film to pull together all the elements that came to define the genre) it was praised for its gritty realism. Shot entirely on studio sets, viewers and critics were blown away by its extreme violence, its authenticity and the bloody Alamo finale in which everyone dies. A violent beheading (which largely occurs off-screen) was deemed particularly shocking, despite the fact that no blood is shown. As time passed and censorship restrictions were loosened, genres of violence (horror, war, gangsters, and westerns) all increased in bloodiness. Sam Peckinpahs Cross of Iron and Platoon were praised in their day for their gore and realism, but today both seem hopelessly stupid. Likewise Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down, two films praised for taking it to the next level, today look indistinguishable from next generation hyperreal computer game shooters. In reality it is only technology that progresses, cinema's understanding of war regressing into the infantile comfort of movie narratives over 90 years old.And yet with each wave of technological innovations, the latest war films pretend to bring us closer to the truth of war. When Private Ryan was released advertisements proudly proclaimed Now You Know!, the implication being that after witnessing the film, we now know what combat is like. Hyperrealism has somehow become conflated with truth, when in fact the two are often in complete opposition.The shaky, desaturated looks of Ryan, Schindler, Black Hawk and Hurt Locker are designed to simulate reality, when in fact they mimic archived, documentary or news footage. The intention is thus not to bring us closer to reality, but closer to a mediated hyperreality, an image of an image of an image, regressing further into what Baudrillard calls the simulacra, further and further from any ground zero reality.Coupled with this, these films offer a curious lack of any real insight into the psychology of the soldiers or the nature or politics of warfare. Beyond spectacle, we get offers of heroism and redemption, but little else. It's as though an obsession with rendering the aesthetics of war real, has pushed past realism into video game simulation and rendered all context and truth void. All that matters is the look and sound of the thing. Surfaces are all you need to know.This, of course, is Baudrillard's description of the 21st century American desert-city. Surface is no longer about the realisation of a thing's essence, about history and truth, but assumes almost the exact opposite meaning. An overemphasis of depth-less surfaces leads to object-hood, rather than art.8/10 - Whilst most war films (Ryan, Schindler etc) exploit the context of war to tell a story of rescue, survival and redemption, the restoration of family and the recuperation of a nation and its history, Fuller has less propagandistic aims. Like his earlier war films, this is pulp journalism, prose before image, his blunt poetry capturing the tone of a Jones or Hemingway. "},{"Title":"reconstruction necessary and memorable","Date":"17 September 2007","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, War","Review":" Samuel Fuller was one of the great directors of American cinema - the Howard Hawks of the low-budget B-movie who had an eye and an ear for the poetry we bump into accidentally on the way to something else. He had the capacity to be a real visionary, but was well-grounded in the common culture so that he never let his vision take off into flights of fancy. He specialized in action films because in action films things happen, forcing characters to confront issues that in straight dramatic films they need only allude to. Fuller was thus able to address certain issues with a directness unmatched by many A-movie directors; in fact, it is this directness that surprises many in Fuller's audiences, and befuddles some.The nearly three hour reconstruction of The Big Red One the crowning achievement of Fuller's career, is as good a case in point as any of his films. At one point in the film, there's a throw-away bit about a homosexual German hospital attendant who kisses a wounded American soldier on the mouth. The soldier takes him by the throat and pushes him away, with the remark I can understand you being horny, Fritz, but you got bad breath. The scene itself should never appear in a 'B-movie' war film, but allowing this to be an 'A-movie', the American's response is a casual toss-off we might expect from a 'B-movie' hero. And after the German curses the American, the whole matter is dropped, and we're off into something more exciting, as the hospital suddenly becomes the scene of an American army attack.What are audiences to make of this brief, somewhat bizarre little interlude? My sense is that our natural response - somewhat amused, slightly bewildered - is exactly what Fuller wants from us; and that's what makes him such an interesting director, he is intentionally eliciting audience responses most other directors fear.The Big Red One is indeed a masterpiece; it is at once all war films ever made, rolled into one; and yet it is also one of a kind. Certainly few films have ever presented the experience of the common 'dogface' of World War II so honestly; and in accomplishing this, Fuller has been able to raise a problem from which most other war films shy away to be a good soldier, one has to forget one's compassion; yet compassion is not only what makes us human, but also grounds the sense of duty that leads many to enlist - we say we are fighting for our country, but aren't we really fighting for our families, our friends? the lovers we left behind, or the lovers we might meet when we get home? War, the brutal celebration of mass death, thus turns out to be about life, after all.The dialog is strong, the acting strong, the imagery absolutely stunning at times. The story is episodic, but each episode is a masterful set-piece. The editing is a little choppy (it's a reconstruction, after all, with only a shooting script as guide), but the good of the film makes the flaws very easy to forgive. And it is truly amazing that Fuller was able to accomplish this on a minuscule budget of $4 million at a time when similar 'A-list' films were costing ten times that amount.But this is the kind of film you get from a director who wasn't about money, he just loved making films. That passion is everywhere present in this movie, and that alone makes it a necessary and memorable experience.

The story is fleshed out and the chemistry between the Sergeant and his Four Horsemen is now a fluid process as they fight and survive their way from North Africa to Czechslovakia and the end of the war. While many people get wrapped around Saving Private Ryan and it's emphasis on brutality, I find myself preferring the story in this film. In particular, how the Sergeant serves as a combat wise man, balancing mental toughness with a compassion towards life and culture that forces his Four Horsemen to examine themselves and find themselves in the madness of everything around them.War films seem to be sorted into two groups, either emphasizing violence or emphasizing the people caught up in the storm. Saving Private Ryan hits its intended audience with tremendous violence and fury. I do not, however, feel for the characters and find them somewhat wooden. The Big Red One focuses on the five Americans. The Sergeant, never mentioned by name, seems real to me as a veteran. Tom Hanks is a great actor, but he doesn't seem to create the realism that Lee Marvin achieves. War films like to show journeys through the conflict. This journey doesn't have the time (or budget) that Band of Brothers enjoyed, but it accomplishes its goal with considerable force. The reconstruction truly brings out this journey through the war in Europe that few films can approach. For the shoestring budget Fuller had at his disposal, he created a film that, at least now with the reconstruction, approaches any of the big budget war films and I believes defeats the vast majority with it's unique and powerful story of survival and comraderie.

Poor dialog, poor action scenes, poor history.Technically, there are just too many silly shortcuts with historical equipment and battle scenes. See other posts regarding tanks etc. Many posts give this movie a pass about this due to its date of production 1980, stating that it should not be compared to the likes of Saving Private Ryan, but when you consider A Bridge Too Far was made in 1977 there is no excuse.Now for some sarcasm. I really loved the scene were they threw grenades right into each others hand, in the dark from yards away. Really that happened? And Lee Marvin shooting at Mark Hamill to get him up to the Bangalore. What inspiration. We know that German squads had every man equipped with a radio. Well, there are too many of these things to mention.This squad seemed to fight everywhere alone. Even on Omaha Beach this squad was alone. And of course they singlehandedly opened up the beach and saved the invasion.I could never feel connected or inspired by any of the action or touching moments. The zealous Nazi reappearing to face this rifle squad seems to just be an insult to the audience.If crude silly sex references offend you, then stay away. Almost every non-combat scene contains some sexual innuendo, comedic and otherwise, most seem very juvenile. If you are over 14 you will not be amused. Only rent it if you are a war movie junkie and just have to see every war movie made. Please do not regard this as history.

We don't murder; we kill. 'The Big Red One' (1980), was made particularly in order to show people what the 1st Infantry Division entering WWII were truly like and how ordinary men fought, bled, and died for our great nation throughout the many hellish war zones and situations some narrowly survived for a few fatal years. The director, Samuel Fuller (Pickup on South Street, Shock Corridor), known for his low-budget genre movies with controversial themes, here wanted to capture the true essence of what these ordinary men had to do to survive extraordinary circumstances the German artillery, D-Day on Omaha Beach in Normandy, a massive counterattack resulting in what became known as the Battle of the Bulge and other famous historical battles. Dodging gunfire and clinging to survival amidst dangerous war zones therein this gritty, gripping war flick, 'Big Red' is a loosely constructed epic account for reconstructing his Fuller's own days in Europe and North Africa between the years 1942 and 1945, displaying both raw power and a rough edge, all the while maintaining a cool and personal perspective that echoes his war-torn trials as they bleed from various moments throughout the picture as we sit there and witness it. So, did Fuller's version of what he personally experienced during the war truly capture the essence of it? Let's take a look.In October 1918, the patch as it is known, a red 1 on a solid olive green background, was officially approved for wear by members of the Division. Worn with pride, the patch symbolizes the legacy and tradition that binds all generations of those who have worn the Big Red One. On August 1, 1942, the first Division was recognized and redesignated as the 1st Infantry Division. The 1st Infantry Division entered combat in World War II as part of Operation Torch, the invasion of North Africa, the first American campaign against the Axis powers that marched and combated through Algiers, Tunisia, Sicily, France, Belgium and then pushed into the German border. The Division continued its push into Germany, crossing the Rhine River. On December 16, twenty-four enemy divisions, ten of which were armored, launched a massive counterattack in the Ardennes sector, resulting in what became known as the Battle of the Bulge. The Big Red One held the critical shoulder of the Bulge at Bullingen, destroying hundreds of German tanks in the process. On Easter Sunday, April 1, 1945, the Division marched one-hundred fifty miles to the east of Siegen. On April 8, the Division crossed the Weser River into Czechoslovakia. The war was over May 8, 1945. Tragically at the end of WWII, there were over twenty-thousand casualties and over one hundred thousand prisoners of war had been taken. Forty-three thousand plus men had served in the ranks, winning a total of twenty-thousand plus medals and awards, including sixteen Congressional Medals of Honor. Nonetheless, the actors on the screen reflected just a glimpse of how the real soldiers back in the day fought for our great nation to the fullest extent. One of the main characters, Pvt. Griff (Mark Hamill), causes to violate his pacifist views because even amidst the chaos and utter destruction around him, he does not believe in and refuses to murder. He values life to the fullest extent. He lives in believing and even states that the true glory of war is actually surviving it. Griff's position in the infantry is a marksman, and a skilled one at that. Nonetheless, the horrors of his war years have finally caught up with him. He is finally stripped of his pacifist views in one scene as he fires every one of his last bullets into a lone German hiding in one of the ovens in a concentration camp used to exterminate the Jews. His face contorting into agony and despair as he does so, it is revealed to him and to the audience that WWII had finally wreaked a psychological toll on Griff, regardless of his heroism and bravery for his country. The horrors of war have finally gripped him into a reality where his pacifist views have come to a grinding halt in his mentality, knowing that his aspects will never again be the same from here on out.I do believe there is a difference between killing and murder. Even though The Sergeant (Lee Marvin) explained the difference in the beginning of the film, I had to agree with what he said. However, my thoughts on the certain matter is that killing is what you have to do in war or in dangerous life-threatening situations where you have to shoot the enemy in order to defend and protect something big or meaningful, their case being the United States and the people of America. Murder has no rational thought, such as randomly stabbing someone with a knife for example. Some people murder only to save themselves or if they are convicted criminals, not for something heroic like fighting for their homeland or for victory. The plot was all about surviving WWII, along with the many horrors that encompassed it as well. This was a wonderful picture altogether, with a glorious display of historical battles given as torn pages from a found war journal for us to relive, recount and remember.

Steel Helmet director Sam Fuller saw action in World War II as an infantryman, and he has fashioned a gripping film bristling with ironies. Eloquently, Fuller meditates about the central theme of war. For example, is war murder or merely killing? Fuller provides an answer in a roundabout way during a later scene when the discussion of murder versus killing crops up. Another theme related to the issue of war is the question of insanity. If war is insanity, then who can be considered sane? A later scene in an insane asylum where our heroes rescue a French resistance agent highlights the insanity issue. What sets this war movie aside from most is that Fuller is able to alternate lethally serious scenes with light-hearted humorous scenes. Lee Marvin stars as an anonymous, hell-bent-for-leather Army Sergeant who is shown as a young doughboy in World War I to an older, wiser NCO in World War II. Naturally, Marvin gives a wholly convincing performance. Indeed, the Oscar winning actor served in the South Pacific as a Marine during World War II so he is more than adequately cast. Star Wars hero Mark Hamill is just as effectively cast as a wet-behind-the-ear Private named Griff who struggles with the quandary about whether war is murder or killing. Hamill is one of a quartet of G.I.s who follows Marvin from Casablanca to Czechoslovakian death camp. Meantime, during the movie, Fuller cross-cuts between Marvin's mentoring NCO watching over his duckling-like troops with Siegfried Raunch's cynical Wehrmach German Sergeant Schroeder, whose comments about war as killing rather than murder mirror Marvin's Sergeant. This is ironic later because Schroeder machine guns to death a German conscientious objector. Writer & director Fuller develops Marvin and his recruits over the course of the movie so they emerge as three dimensional characters. Long before Spielberg messed around with minimal color in his black & white classic Schindler's List, Fuller did so in the opening scene when Marvin boasts about killing a wandering German and presents his idea about the unit patch for the First Division with a strip of red thread. If you want to see the ultimate World War II actioneer that covers just about every aspect of the war, The Big Red One is the standard bearing. Fuller achieves this feat without wallowing in blood and gore, and he doesn't have a multi-million dollar budget to capture the epic sprawl of war. The Normandy scene with the bangolare torpedo is nothing short of brilliant, but unlike Darryl F. Zanuck and Steven Spielberg who had millions, Fuller does so with considerably less. Altogether, the reconstruction of The Big Red One trumps the shorter theatrical release.

Sure it was no Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers, but it did hold up its own quite nicely.The story is about a group of soldiers who make it through the various campaigns throughout World War II, spanding from Africa to Germany and everything in between.The movie did, however, come off as somewhat fractioned, as if the red thread throughout the movie had been cut in various places and then tied together, and the result was this movie. That being said, then the movie is still enjoyable. But it tends to jump from location to location in a manner such as the audience never really gets attached to what's going on, and once we start to get into it, then the year and location changes.The Big Red One does have some good people to the cast list, and it is no secret that I bought this movie solely because I wanted to see Mark Hamill in a war movie. And it was actually quite a nice treat to see him in this movie. The movie is driven by some good characters, however, unlike Band of Brothers or The Pacific, then the audience are never really let into the inner sphere of each of these characters, and as such something was lost to the movie, because the movie failed to build up a relationship between the characters and the audience as a whole.If you enjoy World War II movies, then The Big Red One is definitely well worth watching.

The old man died on Iwo at the age of 24.Back to Big Red One Babyfaced Mark Hammill was the eldest actor of the four junior leads. He was 29 at the time, but looked much younger. The other three were 23-26 years old during the filming, but also seem fairly young. Not quite young enough but...Compare it to BATTLEGROUND, released 3 decades before BR1 and featuring a cast that was predominantly in their 30's and 40's. Compare BR1 to KELLY'S HEROES, released only one decade earlier with 40-year-old private Clint Eastwood surrounded by actors at least his age. These actors delivered great performances, but when I was a kid it created the illusion that the war was fought by men closer to my dad's age. Actually, they were closer to mine! After BR1, war movies generally began to reduce the age of the actors cast as enlisted men. PLATOON, WE WERE SOLDIERS and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN feature the occasional seasoned actor in among a much younger cast. There are exceptions to this of course--we all can think of them--but the trend to younger combat soldiers in American films seems to have begun with BR1.

Unlike most fans, I'm not a big advocate of this new version; I much prefer the original, and find many portions of the new version difficult to tolerate.The Big Red One tells a simple story in 1942, a grizzled Army Sergeant and his rifle squad land on the beaches of North Africa. The film will follow him and four infantrymen as they fight across North Africa, the Mediterranean and Western Europe, right up until the eventual German surrender in 1945.I like Sam Fuller's war movies. Most of them are B-movies from the 50s and 60s, all of which pack a certain emotional punch and have a jagged edge and emotional realism that is largely absent from the slew of other war pictures produced at the time. All of Fuller's tales focus on small groups of infantrymen fighting on the front lines, and the various stresses they endure. The Big Red One is no different. There is no forced jingoism here; the movie is about five men who slog their way through battlefield after battlefield. Their only goal is survival. Nothing else matters.The strong point of The Big Red One is that it always feels genuine. Fuller was a soldier &#x96; this film is largely autobiographical &#x96; and every little detail is right. We see things here that we don't see in other war movies. For example, soldiers put condoms over the barrels of the rifles to keep them from taking in water. This happened all of the time during the war; how often did we see it in WWII films before Saving Private Ryan rolled around 18 years later? Every bit of dialog between the soldiers sounds like it belongs there. People act and talk like soldiers do. The script feels genuine, authentic and fresh.In the new cut, all of these strengths are unbalanced by the added material. Many of the scenes involving women (particularly in a castle, near the film's conclusion) come across as forced and distorted. The dialog never rings true and the cast sound as though they are reading from cue cards. In most cases, the reasons that many sequences never made into the final cut are clear; for example, an extended episode in which a band of French horsemen attack a fortified German position, contains no dialog, fails to develop the principle characters, and distracts from the story. In the original film, the pace was always fast and each sequence stood on its own. There were connecting themes and threads, yes, but nothing too bizarre took away from the realism. This new cut seems too surreal and loses a lot of the realism that was packed in the original version.Favorably, the new cut is much more explicit. There is more visceral violence and profanity than in the original release. These elements had a touch of realism that was often absent from the original.As it exists now, you will either love or hate The Big Red One. I found the Reconstructed Version to be unbalanced and frustratingly slow-paced. I can't watch it over and over again like I could the original version. All of the sentiments and impact of the original cut are lost in a sea of aimless new footage which simply detracts from Fuller's message The real glory of war is surviving. Nothing else matters. In the original film, you got this point in every scene. It could not be missed. Here, with so many in-jokes and meandering scenes going on, it's hard to tell what Fuller is trying to accomplish &#x96; let alone take the film seriously. I even fell asleep during my second viewing. That's how bad of an experience it was.

Another major disappointment is that a lot of Zab's voice-over's which lead you into the next scene, are cut out, especially the two near the end of the movie which was really the major letdowns for me.

While originally released it was fairly choppy, the reconstructed version is much better, and in my opinion stands up to modern movies.Many do not like Big Red One, because it really is in a class of its own. It lacks the flag-waving patriotism as seen in John Wayne movies (which is exactly why Samuel Fuller did not cast John Wayne), and it lacks the idea that soldiers are clean cut, nice guys (Such as Saving Private Ryan).If all you like in a war movie are the battle scenes, you might want to stay away from this one. It has great scenes, but its heart lies in what soldiers really experience. Sex talk, profanity, the fear of losing certain body parts, are all aspects of people in war, far away from loved ones. This is not meant to degrade soldiers, far from it. It is to show that they are people too. While soldiers deserve our respect (especially in this war we are fighting now), they are people, and they have flaws like you or I.Many also refer to the Big Red One as being clichéd. Not really. One reviewer on this site made a reference to ...where some idiot Officer stands up and gives some lame ass speech on Omaha Beach. This lame ass officer was Colonel George A. Taylor, commander of the 16th US Infantry Regiment (Big Red One follows the soldiers of I Company, 3rd Battalion, 16th Infantry). His historical speech was, verbatim, There are two kinds of people who are staying on this beach those who are dead and those who are going to die. Now let's get the hell out of here. It was a real event, and the officer really did say it. (In the movie the Longest Day, Gen. Norman Cota of the 29th Division, played by Robert Mitchum is credited with the speech, but it was in reality Colonel Taylor of the 1st Division.) The problem with Big Red One is those who are young, or those who have no concept of history, take what it presents as cliché. Finding the Hitlerjugend sniper, of only 13 or 14 years old. That did happen. And spanking him, that happened too. Like Marvin's character said You want to kill him, then you be the one to pull the trigger. The speech by Colonel Taylor actually happened. Just because we, as 21st Century young people, may consider it improbable means absolutely nothing. It is not the movie that is cliché, but rather our preconceived notions of what is or is not possible that makes it cliché.A good example of this is the movie A Bridge Too Far. The real Lt. Col John Frost was a technical adviser to the movie, and told Anthony Hopkins that you would never run the cross fires like that. You'd show the enemy contempt for danger by crossing slowly. Hopkins, however, stated that Me, using my actor's imagination, took the road at the speed of light. So which is right? To the history buff, Lt. Col Frosts account, because that is what actually happened. But to the naive person who would dismiss what they consider improbable history as cliché, then Hopkin's acting would be what they prefer. So again, when watching Big Red One (or any history themed movie), keep an open mind. Research before you denounce. Just because to you it seems improbable doesn't mean it didn't (or couldn't) happen.As to inaccuracies, yes we all know that the German panzers are Shermans. But the fact is this was standard of almost any WW2 movie, up until SPR. Sure, Kelly's Heroes had mocked up T-34s as Tigers, but they were obviously faked. Does it detract from the movie? Maybe a little, but it doesn't detract from what the movie is trying to achieve.So, in conclusion, if you can accept that its not as flashy as SPR, and accept that what might appear to be cliché is historical (or at least based on historical fact), you will find this movie to be a gem. If, however, you are naive with preconceived notions of what history is and are unwilling to learn about history and accept that the truth is, in fact, stranger than fiction then this movie is not for you.

Legendary independent filmmaker Samuel Fuller, crafted this film which became a classic. Not only did we have Lee Marvin in this film....but we had Mark Hamill, who proved he has range as a actor. There are so many aspects of this film I could talk about....so many good things to say. There is one scene in which the US infantry unit gets into a gun fight in a insane assylum with some germans. During the fight a mental patient gets up on a table with a german submachine gun and against the backdrop of a painting of the last supper screams I'm sane, I'm one of you! I'm sane! Think about that scene real hard.....think of the irony! It was genius. There was a major subplot in the film, the character GRIFF (Hamill) is sort of a pacifist who has problems killing people in combat. There is constant friction between him and the SGT. (Lee Marvin) and at the end of the film the unit liberates the Nazi concentration camp, during this sequence griff corners a Waffen SS officer in the oven complex and when he sees the bodies of the dead jews he freaks......he starts shooting the officer, reloads and keeps shooting. finally the Sgt. comes in understanding why this is happening, he hands griff another clip and pats him on the back saying You got him. and leaves. This scene is important because we see Griff realizing why it was important to fight the Germans, when he is confronted by the brutality of the Holocaust. There is another aspect to the end, this involves the SGT. The SGT, during the course of the incursion into the camp, discovers a small jewish boy and befriends him. During the film, we've seen glimmers of kindness in him and have come to realize he is a nice guy with a hard edge....however, until the end we never realized how kind he was. He walks around with this jewish kid who eventually dies in his arms...and it changes him. This whole sequence is perhaps some of the finest acting Lee Marvin has ever done...he should have gotten a award or something. Out of anger he too hunts down a German soldier (as in the film's open) with the intent to kill him....now he's sort of in the same situation as Griff. Then once they realize the war was over when the Sarge knifed him they try to save him....the film is symetrical this way...it ends the way it began!

Everybody around the first squad falls like flies, but the Sarge, Skolnick, the Italian guy, the guy with the killer `riods, and Luke Skywalker walk away intact. This kills any believability, which leads to the question is this a straight war film (like A Bridge Too Far or The Longest Day) or an essay about men at war (like the recent Thin Red Line)? I don't think that Fuller knows, so he switches from realistic back to character study whenever it suits him. So what was the point? Personally I think that The Big Red One was Fuller's knowing satire of the big war films of the 1950s, and a semi-satire of his own 1951 Korean War film, The Steel Helmet. Watch this for James Coburn, he gives a good performance as the WW I vet who leads the squad.

Along with several other war tributes to the generation that served our country during the 1940s, Fuller's version is another good film to see.Starring as the main character is Lee Marvin. For anyone who does not know of Marvin's background, he too served in the military in World War II. And now he's fighting for his country again but on screen; where he can't be really killed. Lucky him! Along side Marvin is actor Mark Hamill. Yes-Luke Skywalker is in this movie too! Now America has the force on its side! Hamill plays a character named Griff who is a little bit insecure about himself. He's the kind of person that does not acclimate to war so easily but tries to cope with it. The main things that will grab people's attention are the accuracy of what most of the war was like. Everything was grueling. Everything was communicated by hollering orders. Everything was at war. There are not a lot of characters involved with the plot but you see many brave soldiers die; no doubt about that.There are also some touching moments in this film. Sometimes platoon's would run into run-down foreign European towns where many people did not have food and water. What makes moments great like these is that the soldier's would help them, which is what America does. We help people. We release people from their captives because everyone has the right to be free. The only reason why I did not give this World War II flick ten stars was the way the story line moved. Everything seemed too choppy. First they start out in some place in Africa. All of a sudden, they're in Europe. Wait, where's the transition here? It just felt like the platoon was just migrating from place to place just because they felt like it. That's the only thing that bothers me in this movie. Everything else I appreciate and respect to up-most degree.Containing less gore but the same amount of zeal, Fuller's version of World War II is heartfelt and touching altogether. For any World War II buff, this is another classic that should be on your list to watch.

Samuel Fuller adds his voice to the countless others who have recorded WWII stories, yet manages to create a movie that's completely original in its vision.The largely autobiographical story follows the Big Red One, the nickname for an infantry rifle squad, through many of the war's major battles. Unlike other war films, Fuller's movie resists the urge to reduce each man to an easily recognizable type, and instead creates living, breathing characters who we very much care about by the time the film is over. There are no philosophical pontifications about the absurdity of war, a la an Oliver Stone film or Saving Private Ryan. These are kids being asked to fulfill a role for which they're not emotionally mature enough to fulfill, and they're wholly believable. At the center of the squad is its commander, played by Lee Marvin in a mesmerizing performance. Marvin's character is a career soldier; a prologue to the film shows him serving in WWI as well. He utters few lines and resists any shows of emotion, but Marvin nonetheless conveys so much with a glance or a gesture that a full-bodied portrait of this man emerges. With his men he's crabby, grumpy and full of macho bravado. But the film is peppered with scenes involving assorted children that the squad comes across in its various military engagements, and Marvin's moments with these kids bring an aching warmth to his character. You don't learn anything about his character's life outside of the military, and yet at the same time you learn a great deal about the kind of man he is. He's a father figure to his squad, he's paternal with these kids---yet he's devoted his life to the military....leaving you to wonder if there's a single person in his civilian life who feels any sense of loss at his absence. His is a portrait of loneliness in the midst of constant human interaction.The film has an episodic structure, and it's to Fuller's credit as a writer that he manages to keep his film focused despite the rambling existence of these soldiers' day-to-day lives. There are countless moments that vie for most memorable a battle set in the ruins of what appear to be some sort of arena, in which a group of North Africans on horseback come to the aid of the Americans and the ancient and modern worlds collide bizarrely......Fuller's representation of the Normandy invasion, in which the progress of the battle is represented through recurring shots of a watch on the wrist of a dead man floating in the surf.....a hilarious sequence in which the squad help a foreign lady deliver a baby in a tank....a harrowing battle scene set in an asylum for the insane.....and the film's final battle to liberate a concentration camp in Czechoslovakia, in which the higher goal of the war becomes apparent to these men for whom war has consisted of nothing but disconnected and seemingly purposeless moments of violence.The Big Red One was released after a decade of war films that criticized war and everything it stands for MASH, Catch-22, The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now. But it stands apart from these films, for while it acknowledges the horror, brutality and sometime absurdity of war, it doesn't offer a blanket indictment of it. Fuller understands that war is sometimes an unpleasant necessity, and it's no accident that the movie, which could have chosen any one of a number of endings, ends with the liberation of the camps, suggesting that perhaps there was a point to the carnage after all.A remarkable movie, an award-worthy performance from Lee Marvin, and further proof (if any was still needed) that Samuel Fuller is one of cinema's greatest unsung directors.Grade A+ "},{"Title":"In war you don't murder, you kill","Date":"11 June 2005","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, War","Review":" CGI has more or less killed the war movie...it has stopped being a movie and become more of a reconstruction. It has made it more realistic, but how can a war feel realistic.The Big Red One is based on the director's own experience and tell the story of the 1st rifle squad and they go from North Africa, Italy, France and Germany. It concentrates on the 5 main characters, four soldiers who survive through the whole war and their tough as nails Seargent (with no name) played with great humanity by Lee Marvin. No matter what he is doing, whether shouting at his troops, explaining to a soldier that he has only lost a testicle and his more important member is still there, or killing a soldier, he does it with a great depth.All the most legendary stories of the American military campaign are in this movie, such as Omaha beach, the battle of the bulge and the Nazi Death camps (please never refer to them as Jewish death camps, they killed 6 million Jews, but also 5 million other ethnic people), but they are treated completely different.This is the war movie Felina would have made, with everything from an attack on a mental hospital (where a patient grabs a machine gun and starts shooting everything while claiming that he too is sane). There are people hiding in holes while tanks rush overhead, pinch hitting for dead men (by acting out their sexual fantasies)...and well everything.Made on a small budget in 10 weeks this epic movie blew my mind.The original release was cut greatly by the studio and this release has been reconstructed after the directors death. The result are mixed. The restored scenes are cut differently, emphasizing different things that I think would have been originally intended.There is a difference killing and murder, and no true soldier will ever murder (if only America didn't forget this fact in the Korean, Vietnam and current conflicts).

Marvin plays a grizzled Sergeant, leading a quartet of young men (along with many other, mostly nameless, soldiers) through the various theatres of WWII. The men fight in North Africa, Sicily, Belgium and Czechoslovakia among other places, providing a panoramic view of the war in Europe. Various episodes demonstrate the ferocity, the irony and the warped reality of war as the men struggle to survive and attempt to cheat death. This film has almost as many detractors as admirers, mostly due to it's offbeat approach to the subject matter, it's limited budget and it's lack of adherence to the precise details of military history and equipment. Many people prefer the hyper-realistic battle sequences of Saving Private Ryan, not to mention the pain-staking detail to be found in that film and others. However, this film is just as effective at capturing the futility of war, the random deaths of men and the emotional impact of war, if one can overlook the fact that each tank and gun may not be outfitted to the exact specifications of the originals. Less is more here. The ocean turning red with blood stands in for countless bullets and pieces of body flying. Haunting, unforgettable faces of concentration camp victims take the place of piles of bony bodies. The soldiers' facial reactions tell the story and it is no less powerful than if the atrocities were shown up close. As in most cases, the human imagination is often more terrifying than filmic depictions of violence and cruelty, so the perceptive viewer still gets the gut-wrenching feelings from the suggestion of horror rather than the portrayal of it. Marvin is exceptional as a man whose entire life seems to have been lived fighting and watching men die. He brings all the necessary (yet understated) integrity and humor to the role. Hamill (looking about as attractive as he ever did) is also excellent. His role is the least interesting and least developed at the outset of the film, but his character undergoes the most change and he's well-served by an intense encounter in a prison camp near the end of the movie. Carradine is Fuller's alter-ego, supplying the (at times agonizingly mundane and monotone) narration. Di Cicco and Ward each get a moment or two of showcasing as the other men in the core group. Di Cicco must defend his ethnic heritage (as an Italian) to a big-mouthed fellow soldier. Ward finds himself in the unfortunate position of having to perform an unfamiliar medical procedure inside a German tank! Throughout the film, Fuller's creativity and unusual approach make watching the film an enjoyable experience. The episodic structure helps the pace while intriguing military maneuvers and tactics spark the action. Memorable scenes include the taking of a hidden German gun, the discovery of a mass of dead German soldiers and the liberation of a mental hospital (with the aid of daring Frenchwoman Audran.) The finale is contrived, but meaningful. In all, it's a well-done war film that achieves greatness in a different way than other, bigger and more expensive films have (and, in the case of Ryan, it did so first.)

The Four Horsemen of 1st Squad go from young men trying to act old to young men made old by war more effectively in the Reconstruction. The greatest beneficiary in the new movie is in the story of the transformation of PVT Griff (Mark Hamill) from the rock of the squad in North Africa- to the pariah afterward- to his redemption on Omaha Beach. He really comes off more in the Reconstruction as the most sensitive- and therefore the greatest sufferer- of the squad.The role of Schroeder (Siegfried Rauch)- the German Sergeant ties together the theme much better in the Reconstruction then it did in the original. His role is improved and he is more the moral counterpart of The Sergeant (Lee Marvin).

Does it dry up, like a raisin in the sun? Or does it fester like a sore, and then run? Or...does it just become a feeble masterpiece of a film?Sam Fuller wanted to make this film for years. The Big Red One functions in virtually every one of his films through some points of verbal and/or visual reference. And there is a character named Griff in nearly each movie. All writing on Fuller speaks of his service in this unit as the defining event in his life, and it is impossible to avoid the traces of it in films as disparate as House of Bamboo and Forty Guns. I hate to sound like a dyed-in-the-wool auteurist (although I clearly am one), but the proper comparisons in this film are not to Band of Brothers or Saving Private Ryan, but to other films of Fuller's. This is way more a Samuel Fuller movie than it is a World War II movie. Talk of realism or exactitude is really irrelevant in terms of understanding what Fuller is up to here. He is after the decisive moment, where a man is faced with death. Where a moment's hesitation is fatal, and where the animalistic survival instinct leads us to the choices we make. There is a constant disquisition here on what it means to be human. And all the talk about how we don't murder, we kill has to do with the need to dehumanize the enemy in order to hunt him down. The rare scenes of sex or eating or any kind of pleasure are rushed through and are brusquely cut off, because these soldiers are concerned with SURVIVAL, and LIVING is secondary. Nonetheless, the delivery of a baby is one of the key scenes here, because hope and a belief in a world after and beyond the war motivates the soldiers, at least in that place where they believe that they kill because they are somehow more human. Is this fair? It really doesn't matter - this is point of view film-making. And about that baby- delivering scene. A key Fuller moment, easily relatable to moments such as the shocking opening of The Naked Kiss. Claustrophobic - shot in a tank. Jarring - an abrupt cut to a close-up of the woman's screaming face. Ironic - in the midst of killing hundreds, thousands, all this attention paid to one fragile life. Humorous - the use of condoms as gloves, a cheese wrapper as a mask, Sarge, I'm getting horny, and of course the classic confusion between the words Poussez! and Pussy! Samuel Fuller always said that film is a battlefield, and a scene like this one makes that clearer than many of this film's battle scenes. Having said all this, I will also say that the rhythm of this film is a little leisurely, reflecting Fuller's age. It never reaches the paroxysms of Naked Kiss or Pickup on South Street. I don't long for the lost budget that others complain about, but I do wish Fuller could have made this film while he was in his prime. I am also not totally convinced by the work of the DP. I miss the tabloid look of the greatest Fullers, and the texture of the film is a bit anonymous. But Lee Marvin is a perfect Fuller actor, and his (rare) moments of sentimentality (the scene with the little boy in the concentration camp) capture Fuller's hard-bitten tenderness perfectly (see the Tending wounds section in Nicholas Garnham's excellent book on Fuller). I find it interesting that Fuller portrays himself so centrally as a writer, because the place of language in this film seems so aphoristic and minimal. Language is key, and Fuller's sensitivity to it is amazing. But it is used as a form of shorthand rather than as an autonomous form of expression. The classic Fuller form of irony (seen in all of his films) is found in sentences such as You sonavabitch! You're gonna live if I have to blow your brains out! (Marvin to the German he stabs after the war has ended - murder, not killing) and Did I kill the guy who killed me?( the soldier named Kaiser to Marvin, in a perfect analogy to the Stop! I'm killed! in the gunfight near the end of Forty Guns) and in the scene in the insane asylum where the inmate who has grabbed a machine gun and is strafing his fellow patients, and anyone else for that matter, screams triumphantly I am one of you! I'm sane! OK, it's no great irony...but it IS Fuller-style irony, 100 percent. I will say that this is NOT Fuller's greatest film, and that those who think it is are embarrassed by what Fuller really is and what he stands for. This film is the closest to the look of and tone of mainstream film-making, but I can foolishly hope that it will get some of you more interested in Underworld USA or Shock Corridor, both of which are more unadulteratedly Fuller at his best.

They even stated that this was probably the best World War II movie ever. I'm quite familiar with that kind of movies and I've already seen a big part of them, classics as well as new ones. The most impressive ones I already have in my private DVD collection (Saving Private Ryan, Patton, The Longest Day, The Bridge on the River Kwai, Cross of Iron,...), but I must say that these quotes really made me curious about this movie. On the other hand I didn't want to buy it before seeing it first, because I'm a marketeer myself and I'm all too familiar with good promo talk. They promise you heaven, but in the end you remain with your two feet on the ground while being very disappointed. Now that it was shown on television, I could finally watch it for myself and make up my own opinion about it.Even though The Big Red One is a WWII movie, it starts in the trenches of WWI. It's November 11 in 1918, just after 11 o'clock in the morning, when a German comes out of his trench and says to the surprised American soldier that the war is over. Of course he doesn't believe him and he immediately kills him. After taking the insignia with a red one on it from the man's uniform he returns to his own trench, only to hear that the war is really over and that he has murdered a man (during a war it's called killing, after and before one it's called murder). Almost 25 years later, he's back as a soldier, this time in WWII. He made it to sergeant and now leads a rifle squad in the same division in which he served during WWI, the First Infantry. They get their first battle experience when they invade the by Vichy France occupied Northern Africa. From there on they go to Sicily, France (Omaha Beach on D-Day), Belgium, Germany and Czechoslovakia. As they make their way through Africa and Europe, only five men, including the sergeant, seem to be able to survive. The others are replaced by new, anonymous soldiers who the 'veterans' don't want to know too much about because they will die soon anyway...If you want to know what to expect from this movie, than I believe that you have to see it as some kind of combination of Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan, The Longest Day... But don't get me wrong. I wouldn't compare it to any of these movies and there are two reasons for that first of all was it created with a much smaller budget than those other movies and the second reason is that I don't think that any movie deserves to be compared and analyzed with another movie in the back of your mind. I'm convinced that every movie deserves to be seen on its own. Now that you know this, I can give you my opinion about the positive and negative sides of this movie.There is only one thing that really bothered me in this movie. They sometimes didn't take the time to fully develop all the possibilities a certain part of the story offered. Too many times I had the feeling that certain scenes had been cut in half, that they didn't stay long enough to fully tell the story about what happened in each country. And yes, I saw the long, restored version of the movie, so that can't be the problem. Also somewhat difficult for me was the use of an American Sherman instead of a German tank, but I'm willing to see past that for once because this wasn't the most important and interesting part of the movie. This movie deserves to be seen because it was one of the first war movies that didn't just rely on showing all the battle scenes and that didn't stay on one location, but followed a group of soldiers on their tour of duty while having big interest in the character of the man behind the gun and not just in his capability to fight. This is one of the few classic war movies that has taken its time to fully develop its characters and I truly believe that the viewers should pay more attention to that. What I also appreciated was that Sam Fuller, even though it's obvious that he couldn't make use of a big budget, was still able to make such a powerful movie out of it. The emotions are real, the fact that the veterans didn't pay much attention to the new-comers because they didn't want to lose another friend is the way it really was, the quiet sergeant who has to 'fight' against the will of some of his soldiers,... It all works.In the end this may not be the best WWII ever, many will be disappointed by the small scale of the battle scenes for instance, but when it comes to character development Sam Fuller sure didn't have to learn a lesson. Also the fact that the scenery in the movies was pretty accurate (Take for instance the part in the Ardennes in Belgium, where there were real pine trees, green hills,... instead of the olive trees and a sandy desert shown in The Battle of the Bulge), that the Americans too got killed and weren't some kind of supermen who could kill an entire German battalion with only three men and two rifles, made this movie a lot better than some other 'classics'. I really liked this movie and I'm sure that I'll buy it when I get the chance to find the fully restored version (probably called the director's cut or something like that).

It's a complete waste of time and money.Watch 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'Full Metal Jacket' instead to learn about surviving (ie dont get shot).ZERO stars out of TEN "},{"Title":"dang good war movie","Date":"1 February 2004","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, War","Review":"  ok, up front, i'll admit i'm a mark hamill fan... but, i read the book b4 i saw the movie. it is a relative true adaptation (of course sam fuller wrote the book i think) this was a story that made me want to find out more about the actual battles. yes, it sent me to the history books! now THAT is a recommendation! something that makes you want to know more! so many war movies are all heroics, this one is people, and the horror that war inflicts upon people. it's sad, gruesome, scary, and funny in turns, just like real life! if you are a ww2 buff, sam fuller fan, or lee marvin fan, go for it. if you're a mark hamill (sw heroic type) fan, this one might be disappointing. but he is very good in it. shoot, there isn't a bad performance to be found!

The combat sequences are poorly staged, unrealistic, and tiresome. Nonetheless, Fuller provides some interesting moments, and also is blessed with Lee Marvin in his cast.  However, I doubt this picture will do anything except make you wish you hadn't rented it.

At first glance it's original for a movie of this age, from the other hand, its not that old (1980). The tried to make a war movie that was more, or even not, than a action-movie. They succeeded, but did an rather average job. But then again, its already 25 jears old, although they already had some experience with deeper going movies in that day. The problem simply is; back in 1980, i really might have liked this movie, but now in 2005, i think everything looks a bit corny and simple. The effects are average and not al the thins are accurate (for example the tiger tank wasn't a ww2 tank, it wasn't even a German tank). Conclusion it was a good effort, especially for that time, but lacked enough dept and accuracy. All in all still worth watching!

The films shared a few things which appear once again in The Big Red One--a relatively small cast, small numbers of extras, clipped but realistic dialog and a grittiness not seen in many other war films. So in The Big Red One, despite showing battles such as the invasion of Sicily, North Africa and Normandy, the actual number of soldiers in these massive engagements is very, very small. Many times, in fact, it just showed the same five guys! Fuller tried to hide his small budget by focusing on a small number of individuals but it was obvious he couldn't afford more. Compare these with movies such as The Longest Day and Saving Private Ryan--you'll notice a huge difference. Now this is NOT necessarily a harsh criticism of the film--just an observation since Fuller obviously did not have the huge budgets like Zanuck and Spielberg. This low budget also comes out if you look carefully at the Germans--many of which look rather Mediterranean or Semitic.The film was inspired by Fuller's own WWII experiences--something that made him an excellent war film director. He, too, served with the same unit featured in the film and here he pays homage to the brave men he served with, though it is not meant to be a literal retelling of Fuller's combat career. Like the tough sergeant played by Gene Evans in Steel Helmet, here we have old reliable Lee Marvin playing nursemaid to a group of rookies as the film begins. The film follows them from 1942 to the end of the war in 1945. In many ways, the film also plays a lot like Leon Uris' Battle Cry--which was also based on his WWII experiences.Overall, an interesting homage to the infantry who fought WWII and without the flowery and over-glorified stuff you'd typically find in a Hollywood war film. Certainly not great (as I think Fuller's earlier war films were better and more original) but well worth seeing.

What sinks The Big Red One are not the bloodless battles, or the insipidness of the dialogue, but the fact that none of the protagonists ever gets wounded or killed. Everybody around the first squad falls like flies, but the Sarge, Skolnick, the Italian guy, the guy with the killer `riods, and Luke Skywalker walk away intact. This kills any believability, which leads to the question is this a straight war film (like A Bridge Too Far or The Longest Day) or an essay about men at war (like the recent Thin Red Line)? I don't think that Fuller knows, so he switches from realistic back to character study whenever it suits him. So what was the point? Personally I think that The Big Red One was Fuller's knowing satire of the big war films of the 1950s, and a semi-satire of his own 1951 Korean War film, The Steel Helmet. Watch this for James Coburn, he gives a good performance as the WW I vet who leads the squad.

Basically this story sees an anonymous Sergeant (Lee Marvin), who went through the First World War, leading a company of four surviving soldiers through various combats and dangerous scenarios. The rifle squad in the First Division are Pvt. Griff (Mark Hamill), Pvt. Zab (Robert Carradine), Pvt. Vinci (Bobby Di Cicco) and Pvt. Johnson (Kelly Ward), all of whom have experienced dangerous missions and managed to get out of them, but manage to find themselves in more of them. The squad wind up storming Vichy French Africa into the long siege of Sicily and Italy, participating in D-Day at Omaha Beach, going through Belgium and France, and ending up in a concentration camp in Czechoslovakia. The Sergeant tries to keep them all together and on his side as they go through these scenes, and there are also the small incidents, such as helping a woman give birth, with Private Zab narrating most of the story, and the end sees them save a German soldier's life. Marvin gives a good gruff performance as the leader of the squad, and post-Star Wars Hamill gets his small moments sounding intelligent, I will confess I did not follow a full story, there was no specific plot, but it didn't matter, the best sequences were indeed the battles full of plenty of blood, guns and explosions, making it a rather worthwhile Second World War drama. It was number 98 on The 100 Greatest War Films. Very good! "},{"Title":"My brief review of the film","Date":"12 September 2005","Score":"2 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, War","Review":" Very different to Sam Fuller's best known film noir efforts of his early career, this is arguably superior stuff highly compelling, with a number of powerful sequences. It is not a perfect war film, with rather slim character development, a few unrealistic elements, and a number of other small things that one could pick on, such as the effectiveness of its narration and music choices. However, since it is fairly well shot and edited, not to mention pretty well written and directed too, the film manages to make itself a gripping adventure tale of a different type, with an insight into war combat and a few thought-provoking ideas along the way.
