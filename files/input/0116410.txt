The film has gained renewed topicality with the recent conviction of another white supremacist for the Birmingham, Alabama, Baptist Church bombing, also in 1963.Alec Baldwin gives a solid, and sometimes stolid, performance in the central role of prosecuting DA, Bobby DeLaughter (pronounced DeLaw), himself from Mississippi's white uppercrust, whose marriage hits the rocks because of his pursuit of the case. James Woods, convincingly made up to look over 70 for most of the movie, is electrifying as the arrogant, hateful Beckwith. Whoopi Goldberg portrays Medgar's widow with a lot of dignity and even a touch of humour,  but it would have been understandable if she had also displayed a little more bitterness. The movie is possibly not as powerful as Reiner hoped, partly no doubt because he was restricted by the facts. In particular, the retrial seems to have thrown up little or no new evidence, thus making the courtroom action less dramatic than in a fictional movie.  Perhaps a greater criticism is that the intense focus on Baldwin/DeLaughter, who is in almost every scene, tends to turn him into the hero of the movie; whereas it should be Medgar Evers, who as a civil rights activist in one of the most bigoted areas of the USA deserves everyone's undying admiration. Despite the movie's flaws, it is gripping for most of its 130 minutes, and this was certainly a story worth telling.

Overall the film is pretty good, and doesn't seem to take great license with history, which is refreshing.  My only serious beef about this movie is the same as with Mississippi Burning and other films about the civil-rights struggle Why do all of these movies insist on providing a white male central character, out to do good for the oppressed black people?  Why not do this movie from the POV of Evers' widow, or brother?  Because the (white male) power structure in Hollywood feels that audiences won't relate to stories without having a WASP in the middle of the action.  This is not to minimize Bobby DeLaughter's role in bringing Byron de la Beckwith to justice; it's just to say that DeLaughter came along very late in the overall history of this case.So, as to be expected, we're shown that DeLaughter braves ostracism, family conflict, and a death threat (probably a lot of them in real life).  All very true, but we lose the fact that the Evers family went through all of this and more in 30 years of keeping the flame alive.There are some good performances in here, especially James Woods, who had to be having a blast playing de la Beckwith, a mental midget and virulent racist in real life too.  Baldwin is okay as DeLaughter but as bland as he normally is, even while affecting the Delta accent.  Whoopi Goldberg is very good as the contemporary Myrlie Evers Williams, but ridiculous as the young widow in the flashback sequences.  She's obviously too old, and it leaves you wondering if they were just too cheap to pay another actress or if Goldberg's ego is so large that she wouldn't allow it.  The actor who played Evers' brother is so outstanding in such a small amount of screen time, you have to wonder why they didn't do more with him.It's not a bad movie by any stretch, and it does give us a chance to see a little of what Medgar Evers was all about.  I only wish that the film had been more about Medgar and Myrlie and much less about DeLaughter.  As one other reviewer commented, this feels more like a made-for-TV movie than a theatrical release.

Ghosts Of Mississippi deserved an oscar in every single category that one can be given in because it was that good.I never knew the story of Medgar Evers before I saw this film; but, I learned a lot through watching the film. I hope everyone has the same experience and opportunity I had when I saw this movie because it is one history lesson that should be seen rather than read in history books or newspaper archives. I was truly honored to watch this film.There are several reasons this film is a success; one of them are the performances. Ghosts Of Mississippi is each actors best film of their career bar none. Alec Baldwin brings intensity, aggressiveness and never say die attitude to his role as Bobby DeLaughter. Whoopi Goldberg stars as Myrlie Evers, widow of Medgar Evers, who with relentless pursuit of justice re-opens this murder case. Finally, James Woods stars as Byron De La Beckwith, the defendant, who with great conviction and sincerity brings the essence of the real person to the surface. As great as Baldwin and Woods are in this they do not hold a candle to Goldberg who gives not only the best performance in the film, year but I dare say the best performance of the decade of the 90's.The second reason why this film remains on my short list of best films are the messages that brought up. For example, equality for all and the fact that any discrimination will not be tolerated under any circumstances. Another message I got from this film was under no circumstances should anybody underestimate the power of tenacity because it will make dreams come true every time. This film was thought-provoking, brilliant and compelling. In addition, Ghosts Of Mississippi will move you to tears, put a smile on your face and anger you because these are the emotions I felt watching this movie.

So too this film has been overshadowed by an earlier movie, Mississippi Burning, about the Philadelphia homicides. I was even confused by the similar titles and accidentally rented Ghosts of Mississippi, thinking it to be the earlier film. This is too bad because Ghosts of Mississippi is a winner all the way and Medgar Evers' assassination was as significant, if not more so, than the later dastardly acts of hate and malevolence.Most of my generation remember one of Dylan's early recordings he wrote called Pawn in the Game about the Medgar Evers murder in which Dylan asserts that the coward who pulled the trigger and shot the civil rights leader in the back in front of his wife and three children was carrying out what the racist elements in Mississippi and in the nation as a whole had brainwashed the simple mind into executing. That the endemic racism in American was the real perpetrator of the heinous deed which deprived our society of one of its gifted leaders. Ghosts of Mississippi concentrates more on the scumbag who squeezed the trigger, played with Ã©lan by James Woods, almost a carbon copy of the killer in both speech, mannerisms, and looks.James Woods is a member of a strong cast led by Whoopi Goldberg as the widow, Myrlie Evers, spending her life seeking a degree of justice for her husband and children. William H. Macy adds much needed humor in the role of Charlie Crisco, a member of the prosecution team. Unfortunately, his part is mainly limited to the middle section of the movie. Why director Rob Reiner and writer Lewis Colick decided to turn Macy's character into a cameo during the latter part of the film is unclear.A subplot in the film is the growing involvement of prosecutor Bobby DeLaughter (Alec Baldwin) in the case, opening his eyes not only to the past evils of the society in which he lives but also hostile residue left by the civil rights movement in the state. Married to the daughter of one of Mississippi's most racist judges causes him to be blind to much of the injustice prevalent around him. Significantly, his wife is named Dixie (Virginia Madsen). The change that takes place in his character (which also involves a change in wives) as he is drawn deeper into the thirty-year-old case is pinpointed by his inability to continue to sing Dixie to his daughter to chase away the ghosts she sees at night. In explaining to her that the song might actually be encouraging the ghosts to reappear in her bedroom, the two opt for Old McDonald as a more suitable goodnight song.

One is that, like Mississippi Burning, it gives us white men as heroes.  But that's not particularly bothersome.  African-Americans in the South and elsewhere provided most of the leadership in the civil rights movement, and they did almost all the bleeding, but as been argued insistently political and social power has traditionally been vested in whites.  So it's kind of interesting when an agent of social change comes from the very class that is liable to have to give up some of its power if that change occurs.  We want our share of the pie is a perfectly reasonable argument.  A reply like, Here, take some of ours, draws attention to itself.The movie itself isn't badly done.  Events follow one another logically.  We get to know the characters a little bit.  The score isn't overdone, though it's perfunctory.  But it's as if the film were a six pack with all the cans there but without the plastic thing that holds them all in place.  Like many recent works from Rob Reiner, James Bridges, and Ron Howard, it leaves a viewer feeling good but also sensing opportunities that have been lost somewhere. The problems aren't with the acting.  Alec Baldwin is such an unpretentious guy, for a leading man, that it's hard not to like him whatever he appears in.  (On a TV talk show he once made fun of himself by describing how his high school classmates on Long Island humiliated him and called him Baldy.)  He may never give a bravura performance but he doesn't fail to deliver the goods.  The other cast members are at least adequate with the exception of James Woods, who rises distinctly above adequacy.  Yes, it's a variation of his usual cocky and dominating character, but here he gives it a twist that smacks of red eye gravy, to such an extent that at time we can believe this is Byron de la Beckwith being arrogant, not just James Woods.  Whoopy Goldberg is stiff.  And therein lies a large part of the problem.The characters inhabit, at best, a kind of two-dimensional flatland.  Baldwin is driven by a desire to shake himself and his community of the past and has problems at home.  Goldberg is proud and suspicious of whites.  Woods has only one dimension to play with.  The script and the direction doesn't really give anyone a chance to do much more than enact the simplest of character traits.  Goldberg suffers most.  Her widow speaks in starchy tones -- Perhaps, she says, when all the other characters are saying, Maybe.  Good afternoon, Gentlemen.  Her expression hardly wavers from one scene to the next.  And her finally turning over the transcripts of the first trial to Baldwin is a no-brainer.  It's presented to us as a triumph for her and for the story and for justice.  She finally overcame her suspicion of Baldwin, see.  But nothing is made of the fact that for the first ninety percent of the film's time she is torpedoing the second trial by holding the documents back.  (Why didn't she Xerox them and give them a copy?)  Her saintly status is an assumption made by the director, the writers, and the actress.  What a burden it must be to represent an entire race of people and be plugged into a role that must radiate sanctity. Still, it's a feel-good movie and it's usually nice to feel good.  The injustices of the past can never be rectified but sometimes corrective adjustments can be made in our current social worlds.  And it still takes guts to take a position like DeLaughter and Morris Dies do in this film, even if the film itself goes down as smoothly at Metamucil.  I wonder how many people watching this movie find this all to be ancient history -- the segregation, the intolerance, the hatred.  It must be rather like watching the corrupt and perverted politicians in Gladiator.  Did people really act that way?  Yup.  They did.  And it's not ancient history either.  I was refused service in restaurants in three locations in the South during the 1960s because of my accent, a beard, and because a companion was wearing a sweatshirt with the name of a Northern college on it.  (I'm guessing at the reasons because no one ever handed us a note beginning, These are the reasons you are being politely ignored.)There are times when I think of how far the South has come from such traditions -- and in such a relatively short time -- that I believe Southern whites should be congratulated for having come around, not without resistance and not without violence, but without guerilla warfare anyway.  There are certain lifestyles that we can now rejoice are all gone with the wind.  Not a bad movie.  It's a fascinating story and I wish it had been done better.

The performance by Woods steals the film but doesn't save it. The man was vile and cruel in his racial hate and Woods brings that out flawlessly. Whoopi Goldberg fares okay as Evers who struggles for justice. Alec Baldwin is cardboard as her attorney who makes a case against Beckwith.

It stars James Woods, Alec Baldwin, Whoopie Goldberg, Craig T. Nelson, William P. Macy, Susanna Thompson,and Virginia Madsen.Medgar Evers was killed outside his home in Mississippi, shot in the back, in June of 1963. A member of the Klan and a known racist, Byron De La Beckwith was arrested. The jury at his trial consisted of twelve white men, and while Evers' wife was on the stand, some bigwig walked over to De La Beckwith and shook hands with him. A police officer gave the defendant an alibi. Twice, the trials ended in a hung jury. Thirty years later, the district attorney reopened the case, and the assistant DA, De Laughter, made a commitment to it. Many witnesses were dead, there was no court transcript, and what evidence there was had disappeared. De Laughter's wife left him and he was harassed throughout the investigation and trial.De Laughter, with new witnesses, new evidence, and new jurors won the case. De La Beckwith, then around 70 years old, went to prison and died there in 2001.The movie was filmed in Jackson, Mississippi, where Evers was killed, and members of the Evers family and Martin Luther King's daughter Yolanda were all in the movie, and Mrs. Evers was a consultant.So that's the background. Now for the film. Aside from being based on a true story, and the excellent performance by James Woods as the young and then elderly De La Beckwith, there is nothing to separate this from other courtroom dramas like A Time to Kill and countless others.The story is very compelling and emotional, as it's painful to remember what the south was like for blacks in the '60s, and thinking about this man getting away with murder is infuriating.The problem lay in the focus of the script, which is on De Laughter (Baldwin). It would have been more interesting and helpful to viewers -- now seeing this on DVD nearly 20 years after the movie was made, and 50 years after the incident -- to have learned more about Evers, and to see more of how it really was in the south for blacks, not just some footage at the beginning.Yes, Alec Baldwin was once adorable, as he is here. He's extremely likable and gives a straightforward, honest performance as a hard-working man, a loving father, and a determined attorney who wants to see this case through to the end. Whoopi Goldberg is an odd choice for Mrs. Evers, but an inspired one. She brings quiet dignity to the role that Myrlie Evers undoubtedly has in real life. The supporting cast is good.If this film were made today, the focus would be more on the Evers family. Times have changed. Like the ghost that De Laughter's daughter kept seeing in her room, ghosts who were victims of prejudice and hatred are still around, wanting their story to be told.

The director is Rob Reiner, who directed very good movies like A few good men, Misery and The bucket list as well as other worse like The magic of Belle Isle and When Harry met Sally. In this case, he did a very good job taking into account the script is very tied to the reality. The pace is excellent for a movie of this kind and it has many moving moments and dialogues. I think the duration of the film is the proper one, too. The cast is starred by Alec Baldwin with his powerful voice and believable interpretation of the district attorney convinced of making justice. Although not my favorite, he is noticeable actor with an incredible career, but I think he should work in more varied movies. Anyway, his work in this and others is very intense. Baldwin, in concret, and the performances in general represent a strong point in the movie James Woods (I liked him in The specialist) is not as present in the movie, but his performance is one of the best I have seen him do. He plays the part of the murderer when he was younger and old a masterful performance. Whoopi Goldberg plays a very powerful and dramatic and relevant role as the widow. The rest of the cast is OK Willian H. Macy, Craig T. Nelson... The scenography is simple but realistic and aproppiate as it has to be.

However, the great thing about this film is not the undeniably great performances, it is the story. After all, this isn't a novel, it is true, a story that needs to be told repeatedly. Why? Firstly, to show that not every white in Mississippi is a racist; secondly, to show that happy endings don't just happen in old movies; thirdly, to reassure everyone who has faced injustice due to their colour, religion or background that justice can and does happen, but only when good people are willing to make it happen. Now before anyone accuses me of being some screaming liberal, let me point out that I am a white African, a race as closely (and excessively) associated with racism as Mississippians. Nonetheless, a murderer is a murderer, and so it is good to see the law punish one -- even if it took so many years!

Younger viewers be aware that this film provides mainly a single glimpse of past outrages and racial injustice.Of special impact to me were actual tv speeches by Evers and President Kennedy plus mention of other contemporary atrocities that shocked the country back then.Contrast the original two all white male (hung) juries, so typical of the 1960s South, with the 1990s jury of black and white, male and female.  In the first trial, racist ex-governor Ross Barnett was allowed to make a courtroom entrance and embrace defendant de la Beckwith in front of the jury, interrupting the testimony of Evers' widow.  (Only a year or two earlier, Barnett's treachery in response to a court order to admit James Meredith to Ole Miss resulted in a major riot with  catastrophe for Meredith and the outnumbered US Marshals narrowly avoided.)Lack of more information as to how the legal obstacles, such as right to a speedy trial, death of many witnesses, disappearance of much original evidence, etc., were overcome made the 1990s trial scenes less exciting and the known outcome seem less inevitable than it should have.Fine acting by Whoopi Goldberg, Alec Baldwin, and many others.

I worked as an extra for two days on this film.  An entire speech Whoopi delivered after the verdict was cut (which I might add, I don't think Myrlie delivered at the newscast). Most inaccurate about the film is that much of what is credited to Bobby DeLaughter (who is now a judge) was actually carried out by Ed Peters, Craig T. Nelson's character.  And the men's room encounter between DeLaughter and De La Beckwith never occurred. I have no idea De La Beckwith said or did back in the sixties, but his news appearances and statements in the early-mid nineties didn't help his case any in the public's eyes.

Makes sense, doesn't it? The set design was magnificent and authentic. Nothing was wrong with it. My only gripes are the characters. For example they're wonderfully acted, but not really convincing with the exception of James Woods disturbingly evil, but somewhat funny old Kook in boonies rendition of infamous assassin Byron De La Beckwith and Alec Baldwin as the driven and selfless District Attorney Bobby DeLaughter. The characters could have been a little bolder like in The Long Walk Home. You want people to hate this guy,Beckwith and you want see this film and feel like someone just punched you in the stomach. For example, as the DeLaughter family was being harassed; We could've seen the rawness of racist opposition not just a shattered windshield and name-calling and a sanitized version of a bomb threat at the family home! What bothers me, is that movies that involve racism and the South should give you a feeling of resentment, it shouldn't have a Disney Channel subtle tinge to it. This is the Achille's Heel that makes Ghosts of Mississippi fall short of a convincing murder mystery.I'm not saying that I hate this film. I actually liked it, I still like it. But it could be bolder. A movie about the Civil Rights era in the South should convince you, shock you, anger you, and show various perspectives about the subject. That, my friends is what makes a docudrama stand out.

I understand it is a piece of American history but it could have been made palatable if the mystery of who-done-it was further explored, I mean after all it took then 30 years to find out who did it so why couldn't it have taken just a little longer than 15 minutes to tell us? Many stars got a piece of this film and most of them read the lines pretty well but the lines were crumby and I predict that this film will fade quickly into obsurity where it belongs and maybe some day someone will make an interesting movie about this interesting piece of history.

So what? Do they have to turn everything into a movie? Not every story life wrote is also interesting in fiction.Being the 5189th courtroom drama from Hollywood, nothing in this movie is impressing. Nothing &#150; and I like courtroom movies. The white-kills-black-and-the-other-way-round-problem has been stressed enough by others including John Grisham already. This movie doesn't even offer an inner conflict viewers might be involved in, because there's no doubt today that some one who kills another one is supposed to be imprisoned, no matter what color of skin his victim had. Only racists could possibly take the other part and I don't think the movie was thought for racists.&#132;Ghosts of Mississippi` is not gripping at all. In the end, before the verdict is announced, there are exactly two possibilities what might happen &#150; guilty or not guilty &#150; and by stretching the situation Rob Reiner gives the viewer enough time to prepare for both solutions and not to be surprised or feeling anything else no matter which of the verdicts the jury reaches.The movie is full of clichÃ©s, the characters' way of thinking is even simpler than in similar American movies. Of course, the lawyer has some little chrildren and he explains them that it's right what he is doing. Of course he has a wife who feels neglected because of his work. Of course, there is the widow of the victim who is still fighting against that one bad man who killed her husband. Nearly everything is comprehensible, but it's also boring and hackneyed.What I understand least, is that so many distinguished actors took part in this disaster. Whoopi Goldberg is only sentimental all the time, with her famous face expression where you don't know, whether she is smiling or crying. And James Woods, over-over-acting, is put into a completely unnecessary and amateurish make-up &#150; it's like little children playing drama at kindergarten. Maybe, James Woods was so ashamed of the movie that he had his face covered until he was not recognizable any more. I forgive him. But only him.  "},{"Title":"Rather plodding film that is watchable but relies too much on the impact of the subject matter rather than putting in the work itself","Date":"31 May 2004","Score":"1 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  In 1963 the black civil rights leader Medger Evers was shot down on his driveway. The suspect was a white man called Byron de la Beckwith who is naturally acquitted. Mrs Evers never gives up and, around 30 years later she gets a lawyer to try and prove jury tampering and thus force the DA's office to reopen the case. Despite only have two pages of an old police report and none of the original physical evidence, the Assistant DA Bobby DeLaughter reluctantly picks up the case and begins to investigate. Over several years of effort, he begins to make progress &#150; a fact that leaves him exposed to black politicians, white politicians and racist groups from all over the state. Movies about civil rights and the degree of racism in the 1960's Southern America are always going to be impacting because they are based on fact and it is hard to watch such 'facts' from just a few decades ago in a supposedly world leading country. However these films cannot rest of their subject matter and rely on that to deliver the goods &#150; they must have good acting, writing, directing etc just as any other film. In a way that is what this film does &#150; it relies on the impact of this true story to do all the work while the other aspects of the film are weak. The basic plot is OK and is based on a true story but some of it is dumb. Some of it must be fictionalised and I really, really hope that Mrs Evers did not sit on the original court transcripts for decades, thus greatly hindering any work by the two or three DA's she has trying to reopen the case. Could she not have photocopied (in the late 80's) the document and passed that on, while keeping the original safe? Like I said &#150; I don't know if this is true or not but I hope it is not in this regard particularly. Outside of this nitpicking, the actual story is enjoyable enough and it is hard not to be moved by the background and the emotion of the reality &#150; however the film rather lazily rides on this and relies on the history and several key moments to keep it going. Certainly Reiner has no clue how to inject energy and tension into this story &#150; happily sitting back and letting the material speak for itself rather than working to make it better as a film.What I mean by 'relying' is that other aspects are poor. The actual script is weak, writing lazy heart-string-pulling moments combine with dialogue that isn't natural and is slightly corny, to damage the film. It is a shame, with such a solid courtroom thriller to work with that the writing isn't any better. Likewise the characters are very basic &#150; Delay is evil, Evers is a strong, good-hearted woman with a lot of dignity and a reservoir of emotion, DeLaughter is a good family guy etc etc. I'm not saying that they are not like this in real life but the film makes no effort to expand on these basic brushstrokes. For this reason the cast don't perform that well (even if some were nominated for various awards). Baldwin is OK in the lead role &#150; he is a solid actor and does what is required &#150; but he hardly stands out. Goldberg carries herself with dignity until she gets her chance to let out emotion near the end &#150; it is an easy character and Goldberg hardly has to stretch even once. Woods is a better actor than this film would let you think &#150; his character is a good racist but it is a simplistic performance that hardly gives Woods a chance to shin &#150; he simply does what anyone else would have done. The support cast is full of famous faces that add real class even if they don't have much more to do than show their faces and deliver simple roles. Macy, Madsen, Nelson, Ladd, Romano, Stahl and Cobbs stick in the mind the most and are all OK. The film also has Darrell Evers playing himself but chances are you won't spot this until the end credits unless you really know this story well and know what he looks like.Overall this is an OK film that is interesting and passable. However it is a little annoying because it could have been a lot better (and thus impacting) if it had had a better script, better characters, more interesting direction and had been edited to be a bit tighter. The film goes for easy emotional shots and it relies on the involvement of the actual true story to keep the audience engaged; luckily for it's sake the story is interesting and involving enough to be worth seeing even in this half-cooked effort.

Over half the film should have been cut and stronger dialogue added to the more potent scenes. The director has destroyed an important story line and topic by diluting all the drama and stereotyping the performers which is a shame because blokes like Alec Baldwin show he can actually act but he has to do it with the weight of the world on his shoulders. Whoopi is a fine actress in anything but here she is washed away by turgid meanderings. James Woods stands out mainly because the director forgot everyone else in his attempt to show one evil man rather than a ridiculous and evil system. American Blacks must view this film with the same angst they would a Laurel and Hardy film. And with as much respect.
