Gimme back the days of The Dark Crystal, Jim Henson and the Gremlins. For a family movie this is also very straight-faced too. There is not much humor in it, but that only adds to the overall weird tone.The story is of a wizard apprentice called Galen (a very young Peter MacNicol) who goes on a quest to slaughter a Dragon terrorizing the people of Urland (Ireland maybe?). There are long moments of quiet and a strange atmosphere brewing around the whole movie. It looks and feels quite unique.No doubt this is owed a lot to the fabulous widescreen compositions, visual effects that range from not bad to surprisingly good and stunning scenery and locations. Indeed the mood of this film is something I've never come across in a fantasy film. Plus for a film that is rated a simple PG, there was quite a lot of graphic gore, violence and even slight nudity. Surprising, but it adds to the boldness of the production. You would never get a family movie like this these days. I will take Dragonslayer over Harry Potter anytime.Filmed in Panavision, the 2.351 anamorphic picture looks really great in most scenes but in others there is a small problem with the black levels. The soundtrack has been remastered in Dolby 5.1 and it is surely loud and forceful. Unfortunately there are ZERO extras. Which is a shame, because for a film like this, I really want more.

In fact for such a role there has surely never been a more appropriate choice of actor other than of course, Peter Jackson casting Sir Ian McKellen to play Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.For fans of sword & sorcery and fantasy movies in general, this really is an absolute must see!

It's also nice to see a film which doesn't stereotype Pagans and magicians as evil.

However, what makes this movie unique are its visuals, which through creativity and hard work, outshines many fantasy movies of the 90's and early 2000's.This film proves that it doesn't need 21st century technology to make a beautiful and visually complex piece. As I watched the dragon, it was easy to tell that it was not real; it had flaws in its appearance and its movements were not perfect. But that did not detract at all from the film, because what made the dragon impressive was the artistic elements of its design; its many layers of thin, translucent membrane, its finely chiseled and formed teeth, and the almost charcoal-like, tough scales on its hide. In many modern fantasy movies, the creatures and dragons are uninspired, dull, and drab, despite the computer engineering behind them. In the 80's, directors had to be creative to produce their desired effect, and this creativity went a long way in producing visuals that both wowed audiences with their appearance and the thought of the work that went into making them.

Fairly good performances from all nonetheless. The plot is top notch. This is not simple minded hack and slash. So if you want some mindless action flick, go elsewhere (preferably over a cliff). The plot moves slowly and you have to pay close attention to details or else you won't get it. In fact the the first time you watch it you may think you see some errors. They are not.

Story is about a village that sacrifices young maidens to a dragon that has been marauding the countryside. A group from the village travel to see a sorcerer named Ulrich (Sir Ralph Richardson) and ask him to slay the dragon which he accepts but is killed by the King's sheriff. Ulrich's young apprentice Galen (Peter MacNicol) decides to step in and agree to the task with the help from a magical amulet. The village is headed by King Casiodorus Rex (Peter Eyre) who has a lottery where the name of a young girl is picked for the sacrifice for the dragon but the King doesn't put his own daughters name in the drawing.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Galen is taken to the dragons lair and he causes a rock slide and he believes that this has killed the dragon but as it turns out it didn't and it comes back to wreak havoc so the King quickly starts up another lottery. Meanwhile, Galen has fallen in love with Valerian (Caitlin Clarke) and her father has made a mighty sword that hopefully can slay the dragon. Galen and his weapon head into the dragons lair to try and kill it but he quickly finds out that this dragon is going to be harder to slay than expected.This film is directed by Matthew Robbins who never really had a great career as a director but he did have some success as a writer but he can be happy with this film because it's still considered the best dragon flick to date. Disney and Paramount got together to make this and the special effects by Industrial Light and Magic are just terrific and still stand up today even though effects have changed with CGI. The DVD transfer suffers somewhat and the studio's should definitely digitally remaster this film and re-release it on a special edition DVD. What makes the effects stand out is that they brilliantly made sure the dragon moved like a dragon would and it crawls like a bat or a lizard and it adds greatly to the reason why this is the best of it's kind. Robbins also does the right thing by not allowing the audience to get a good look at the dragon except in glimpses and it builds the chills and excitement until we finally do see the dragon. The film looks great from the wonderful location shots in Scotland to the dirty hovels that people lived in during those times. Richardson is a joy in a role that is to small but he makes the most of it with a lot of Latin muttering and lines like Do you have anything to eat? One of the highlights in the film (For me, anyway) is Clarke as the love interest and I was always charmed by her tough but attractive performance. She still pops up every once in a while in small roles but this was her largest role in her career and last I've heard she teaches at a college in Pennsylvania. Probably not a great film as it does lag in spots but don't let this sway you because this is a fun film and one hell of a dragon!

Curly haired Peter MacNicol even looks like a Hobbit! This is all a world away from the muscular heroes, scantily clad damsels in distress and fake looking weapons and armour in most fantasy films of the time, and interestingly foreshadows the look of Peter Jackson's trilogy. As an example of this, if you can find it, check out the mocked up trailer for a supposed Peter Jackson production of The Hobbit which has been floating around on the net - it's interesting to note how well the shots from Dragonslayer used in the trailer fit in with the footage from The Fellowship of the Ring.(As an aside, the other film which Dragonslayer reminded me of was, bizarrely, Monty Python and the Holy Grail - the title sequence and plinky plonky music could almost have been lifted directly from Holy Grail, and the shots at the end with Ralph Richardson standing on top of the mountain are almost laughably close to the Tim the Enchanter scenes, probably due to very similar locations being used in both films, both being shot on the Isle of Skye in Scotland.)Secondly, the film explores some interesting themes, principally the spread of Christianity in sixth century Britain and the consequent decline of the old pagan ways, represented by magic, and for that matter, dragons. The fact that to destroy Vermithrax the source of magic in the film must also be destroyed is quite a clever metaphor for the changes of the times the film is set in. This is very similar to some of the underlying themes in Arthurian legend, so fans of Excalibur may want to check out Dragonslayer for this reason.Lastly, an honorable mention must go to Phil Tippets wonderful, stop motion dragon effects, which still look great today - again, they don't look at all out of place on The Hobbit trailer. It's easy to see why ILM was nominated for a special effects oscar in 1982 for Dragonslayer. Anyone bored with modern CGI should check this out - I can't help but wish that ILM had gone back to these kind of effects for at least some of the special effects shots in the Star Wars prequels.Ultimately, Dragonslayer was a brave attempt to do a realistic fantasy movie, being set as it is in the real world and concentrating on character development for long periods of the film (the dragon hardly features in the first hour). However, it doesn't quite succeed, mainly due to wooden acting, the wonderful John Hallam excepted, and somewhat unengaging direction. Also, the ridiculously jaunty music at the end is completely at odds with the tone of the rest of the movie. Still worth checking out for fans of fantasy films though.Rating - 6/10         "},{"Title":"If only there were more fantasy films like this!","Date":"15 January 2007","Score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":" If you are looking for a movie to entertain the kids over the weekend and you pick this off the shelf because you notice the Walt Disney logo up the top, beware &#150; this is not quite what you would expect from a Disney film. I was 9 years old when this film came out, and my dad hired it from the local video store for me to watch one afternoon after school. While I wasn't overly scared by it, both my father and I were very surprised that it was a Disney film, as there were semi-graphic depictions of young dragons feeding on a fresh kill (a princess!), and no real element of humour at any stage. Still, we loved it, and I watched it several more times before we took it back to the store. Like a lot of people in the age of DVD I have begun buying up every favourite movie and TV show I have ever had, and naturally Dragon Slayer made the list. I was worried before my first viewing however that the recent Lord Of The Rings trilogy would make this childhood favourite seem dated and comical, but instead I was pleasantly surprised. It appears both fresh and realistic, and the special effects are not lacking in the least. On a whole it is hard to find fault with this film, and it has many elements in its favour that set it apart from most other films of the genre. The casting is terrific, despite the extreme weedyness of the main hero (Peter MacNicol), but as another reviewer on this site has pointed out &#150; this was probably an intentional decision by the film makers and not a result of bad judgment as my father and I had originally thought. The scenery is extremely beautiful throughout, my favourite scene coming half way through the film where the castle wall crumbles down and the hero leaps his horse out onto the grass while the sun is setting on the horizon &#150; a magical moment! The dragon is fabulously depicted, complete with the most menacing scowl I have ever seen on a dragon in any movie. It's size is in keeping with it's type (if you are a Dungeons and Dragons fan you will know that dragons come in different sizes according to their type), and it's movements are nice and fluid considering that it was made a quarter of a century ago (even the walkers and creatures in The Empire Strikes Back are more jerky with their movements). What I like most of all though is the film's dark mood and menacing realism. Most films of this kind tend to get tainted by the touch of Hollywood, in that they are usually subjected to fancy and unrealistic fighting maneuvers, humour, big name casting and modern colloquialisms. How refreshing then that Dragon Slayer goes in the opposite direction on all these levels. The characters are everything that you would expect from the period (the king is portrayed as a concerned ruler who loves his daughter, and his champion a tough, level headed warrior bent on protecting both the king's and the people's interests), and their dialogue never strays either. The film does not attempt to avoid death scenes or mass destruction, and this only serves to enhance the feel of a real wizard verse dragon fantasy. Then of course there is Caitlin Clarke, a woman so beautiful that young boys everywhere will be struggling to decide whether to focus on the girl or the dragon! Almost the perfect fantasy experience, let Dragon Slayer stand as a reminder to modern day film makers how a Dungeons and Dragons movie should really be made! 10 stars!

The tomboyish Clarke is an intriguing presence and Richardson has some fun in the sorcerer role. Unfortunately, there's too much B-grade acting and some of the plot makes no sense even for a fantasy. (Why don't all those virgins just escape their dragon problem the old-fashioned way?) Treating Early Christianity as an upstart, and not always too effective, form of magic is interesting. It was a nice idea to make the King a politician, rather than a piece of furniture. The old sorcerers seem to be dying out, without a credit, and the upstart religion is getting turned into a political tool.

A sorcerer's apprentice (Peter MacNichol) is sent to kill a dragon which has been devouring girls from a nearby kingdom . An older magician (Ralph Richardson) is the mentor of the rockie sorcerer . The young boy dreams becoming a valiant sorcerer and join forces with a girl (Caitlin Clarke) to vanquish a horrible dragon . The young wizarding apprentice suddenly finds himself the only person who save the kingdom from a free-breathing dragon . This fantasy movie packs action , witchery and and sorcery with impressive battles . Likable performance by a young Peter MacNichol , though is the first film released under the Disney name to have full frontal male nudity , as when Peter MacNicol jumps into the water, his legs swing wide giving the audience a quick shot of his genitals . Funny acting by the veteran Ralph Richardson and enjoyable support cast . The story has many familiar dragon motifs found throughout Western culture , in particular Saint George and the Dragon, in which maiden sacrifices were made to appease a harassing dragon. Saint George's tale also includes a sacrificial lottery resulting in the surprise condemnation of a princess , Saint George is also frequently depicted with a magic blessed lance or a sword . Smart screenplay by Hal Barwood dealing with fantasy medieval , dragons , necromancy , fantastic kingdoms and many other things . Entertaining and fun movie with acceptable special effects bringing the dragon to life . Work on dragons made by CG sometimes seem authentic , but is also noted its computer realization . First film to use go-motion, a variant of stop-motion animation in which parts of the dragon were mechanized and the movement programmed by computer . During shooting, the computer moves the model while the camera is shooting, resulting in motion blur, which makes the animation more convincing . The only thing that let it down from this perspective , was that some of the parts in between the dragons fighting were a little dull . Colorful cinematography , shot on location in Wales , though the final scene was shot in Skye, Scotland and many town locals were employed in the film as village extras. Thrilling as well as spectacular musical score by the classic Alex North , some of the score by Alex North was recycled from music he'd originally composed for 2001 A Space Odyssey that went unused . This co-production between Walt Disney Pictures and Paramount was efficiently directed by Matthew Robbins and it was more mature and realistic than most Disney films of the time .The picture belongs to Fantasy/Dragon sub-genre ; other important films dealing with Dragons are the following  ¨Dragonheart¨ by Rob Cohen with Dennis Quaid , Dina Meyer , Jason Isaacs and Julie Christie ; ¨Dragonheart , a new beginning¨ with Chris Marterson , Figueroa and Harry Von Gorkum ; ¨Dragom Storm¨ (2004) by Stephen Furst with Maxwell Caufield , Angel Boris , Tony Amendola and John Rhys Davies ; and other latter day movies and belonging to this Dragons sub-genre are ¨Reign of fire¨ (2002) by Rob Bowman with Christian Bale, Matthew McConaughey , Izabella Scorupco , and Gerard Butler ; ¨Eragon¨ (2006) by Stephen Fangmeier with Edward Speleers , Robert Carlyle , Sienna Gullory and John Malkovich .

Without being too camp, it manages to be very entertaining, and along with NeverEnding Story, Princess Bride and Legend this is one of the better fantasy films I have seen. The film benefits from some very stylish costumes and sets, and the breathtaking scenery helps as well. The music score is highly atmospheric, and filled with beautiful and haunting themes. The film has a good plot with some nice twists, themes and turns, a decent script and good characters. I will admit one or two of the supporting characters are thinly sketched compared to the wizard Ulrich, and there are parts when the film suffered from pacing problems. But overall I really enjoyed Dragonslayer. I forgot to mention the acting. Peter MacNicol is a likable enough lead with his spontaneous boyish charm, Caitlin Clarke and Chloe Salamon are stunning as the female leads, and Ralph Richardson without a doubt steals the movie as Ulrich. Also, how can I forget the dragon? Plain and simple, best designed dragon in any fantasy film, the movements, the design, the creepiness everything, flawless. Even better than Draco in Dragonheart, despite Sean Connery's majestic voicing. All in all, a couple of minor flaws, but it is most enjoyable, and one of the better fantasy films out there. 8/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"Rather Good movie with something to tell...Paganism vs Christianity","Date":"8 March 2006","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":" By chance I purchase this DVD wide screen edition from a DVD retailer in a mall.

It is interesting to note that in several occasions, they seemed to suggest that the co-existence of Dragon and Sorcerer belief. A good crue to that was the last sorcerer once told Joey If it is not for the sorcerer, the dragon won't exist anyhow. At that times,Christianity gained hold with the villagers even the king has a bishop.And in the final sequence, the old sorcererUlrich asked his disciple Galen to destroy him together with the magical amulet...and Galen would know when to do that..and by destroying the last sorcerer, the dragon would no longer exist.Isn't it a hidden motive of condemning the paganism is the origin of many myths of dragon/monster etc? There was a scene Ulrich had a peek on the crucifix wore by Caitlin(Joey) and seemed to be content that it was the time the Christianity should triumph over the paganism.Worth a watch. Caitlin was so cute in this movie but she passed away not too long ago. Her dark thick long hair certainly make her pale white skin so well contrasted! The dragon CGI is great at that 1980's...but still look attractive nowadays!(same guys who did the Star wars..). Pace is OK..not too slow..not too fast...enough time for characters developments.

Aside from the occasional weak attempt (e.g. Dungeons and Dragons), public demand for this kind of movie seems to have mostly faded (especially fantasy/sorcery epics).  Dragonslayer is among the best of the genre -- Conan the Barbarian (the first film, and to a lesser degree the sequel) being another of my favorites.  This particular film pays surprising attention to detail, both in plot and in visuals (note how the dragon uses its tail to balance while on the ground and in flight), and actually requires that the brain be in gear in order to follow the story (a welcome surprise).  To see a film in the fantasy/adventure genre that ISN'T dumbed down is both unusual and gratifying.  The acting is also very good, if occasionally a bit overblown.  Flaws are surprisingly few and far between.The movie is very much in the tradition of such great epic novels as Ursula K. LeGuin's Earthsea trilogy (within the confines of the 2-hour movie format).  More of the dragon would have been welcome (although Vermithrax gets a decent amount of screen time), and DEFINITELY more of Sir Ralph Richardson (Ulrich) working some acts of great wizardry!  But I'm not complaining too loudly, because Dragonslayer is a great film in its genre, a classic of high fantasy.  Every time I see it I catch some new detail missed on a previous viewing.

The middle ages atmosphere is excellent, with some very nice touches.  I especially like the way the hierarchical society is portrayed; how everyone defers to the king without thinking.  It is much better than movies in which people act and speak just as they do in modern times, only with the historical costumes and sets around them.However, the real star of this movie is the dragon, which was created by George Lucas's prestigious ILM outfit.  Despite the fact that it was made using stop-motion techniques, it is still very convincing -- especially when it breathes fire (which it does quite often!)  The dragon's movements are always smooth and life-like, and this is aided by a truly frightening design for the dragon's face. The tiny, smouldering red eyes convey an intense fury that makes the villagers' fear of the dragon quite understandable.  One can also tell that a lot of effort went into giving an impression of sheer size with this monster.There are no silly-looking shots in which various elements are mismatched in terms of scale (such as a supposedly enormous creature breathing flames that look as though they are produced by a match). Even when the dragon splashes into a lake, the volume of water thrown up looks huge (no individual drops are visible, which is a mistake that FX artists still make eve today).  The result is one of those rare sci-fi/fantasy movies which ages well.  Even though the techniques used in this film have been supplanted by new ones, it is still easy to sit back and be awed by what is happening on screen.

The look of it is great - the locations impress and chill you at the same time, the sets (especially the cave interior) are detailed, and some of the dragon special effects are great, beating a lot of similar effects done with computer graphics nowadays. The story had some interesting (and unexpected!) plot turns.However, while the movie is a good rainy day viewing, I didn't feel it to be much more than that. Minor stuff first. While some of the dragon special effects were good, there were others (mainly when the dragon was flying or crawling) that looked pretty bad. I don't know if it was because of the source print (clearly Paramount didn't bother to restore the movie, given there are some visible scratches in some parts), but on my TV screen the dragon in those sequences looked badly superimposed, and actually *worse* than some computer graphics nowadays! The biggest problem I had with the movie (and the reason why I think the movie was a box-office failure) is that there are no real strong and compelling characters. The youthful hero (and his eventual girlfriend) don't have that much depth and personality. There are signs that some character development (not just of those two characters) got cut out, given the abruptness of a few scenes. As well, I couldn't really figure out just was what propelling that evil henchman knight character to do all that evil stuff he was doing.

Well, I just recently saw it again, after years of not watching it. I must say that this time around I found the story more interesting and the effects hold amazingly well for a 26 year old movie. The main problem with DRAGONSLAYER is that none of the characters are strong enough or well developed and I didn't feel anything for the character's, except maybe Caitlin Clarke (which I thought she was hot!). I get the impression that the movie is one big set up for the climatic battle with the dragon, and in this respect, I thought that scene was very anti climatic. DRAGONSLAYER begged to have a better direction and a better editing. Alex North's score is richly symphonic but is criminally misplaced all over the film. You get supposedly quiet scenes and the music playing behind is fast paced and furious. There's no sense of timing with the music. It's as if though North composed the soundtrack regardless of what went on in the film. And Ralph Richardson's character as sorcerer Ulrich is a great waste of talent. What could have been a great mix of Kenobi/Merlin/Gandalf/Yoda was rendered poorly, I think. In short, DRAGONSLAYER is a fun movie to watch that had all the potential to be as good and as big as 1981's true blockbuster RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.

Unfortunately you don't get to see too much of her throughout the film, but when you do see her for the first time, your jaw will drop.The acting is great if not a bit campy at times. However the camp in this film adds to the entertainment value, not subtracts from it. There is a dark quality to Dragonslayer, but not so much as to deter the less hearty film enthusiast, just enough to tip the scale from a typical Disney fluff film to a quality fantasy epic. There is also some welcomed dry British humor in this film that offsets Dragonslayer's darker tones.Even if you don't like the genre, see this film for the effects alone.

It's fun to see Peter MacNichol so young, and I think he played the part of the cocky apprentice sorcerer very well. He had just the right balance of awkwardness and youthful arrogance to pull it off. The one thing he didn't portray well was the romance with Valerian. Friends, maybe, but I couldn't see them marrying and having a family or anything.Caitlin Clarke was a lovely lady (and man as well), and I largely enjoyed her portrayal of Valerian. I thought her distant personality was authentic to a girl who's lived her whole life having to hide her identity, and likewise her awkwardness once she finally appeared in a dress. She didn't portray the romance well, either, but I can excuse that from a woman who spent her life as a man. Somehow she seemed to get a little less brave as a woman, however, and I'm not sure why.I also liked the character of Princess Elspeth-- not only was she beautiful, but intelligent and assertive in a time women wouldn't usually have been so. I liked that she was the one royal with integrity in the movie, and though it would've been nice had she survived and created a better kingdom, you've got to respect how well she faced her end.Unfortunately, two of the characters I liked best, Ulrich and Hodge, got little screen time. They were both interesting old fellows (if a bit kooky). It would've been interesting to see more of their relationship.The dragon effects were pretty cool, especially the way she moved while crawling through the cave. The babies were pretty cute, too, as monsters go. I'm glad the dragon wasn't the star of the movie, the way monsters tend to be now. It's much more frightening when a creature is lurking around, largely unseen, than starring out front in every scene.

I remember being scared and excited. It's a dark film which, unlike Star Wars, never has a real sense of good versus evil. Even as a kid I remember thinking - they want to kill the last ever dragon (at least I think it was). That's sad, isn't it?As a kid, of course, I remembered it most for the dragon. There's real tension in the fiery caves. At the time, the special effects were cutting-edge. This dragon was huge. The dreadful pause before it breathed fire - and the sound it made when it did - was genuinely scary.Another reason this film left a huge impression on me is that no sooner did it leave the cinema, it seemed to disappear without trace. Video players were still relatively new toys, and I don't ever remember it playing on terrestrial TV in the UK. In other words, I remember it as a nine-year-old. And, like Star Wars, there's really no other way to remember it.So it was with some trepidation that I saw it again on the SciFi channel recently. Small screens and adverts ruin the best films. But what can I say? Here's a film that's stood the test of time. And in many ways, in this CGI-obsessed era, it's somehow improved.If some of the effects look a little flaky now, they also look special - it makes you realise that filmmakers (Lucas among them) abuse the technology of CGI and reduce spectacle to zany video game.Dragonslayer still has spectacle. It still has awe. I even recognise some of the locations - Glyder Fawr and Glyder Fach in Snowdonia, North Wales. The Cantilever stone! Castell Y Gwynt! I've walked in these places. Next time I go, I'm going when the sky is moody, the wind howling, and I can imagine a dragon swooping for the kill.What's apparent is that Dragonslayer was way ahead of its time. It remains a good film today, in my opinion, and all the better for its ambiguous morals. The humans are mostly selfish - some have dubious motives and are not above corruption and deceit. By comparison the dragon seems noble. And I think that is why, at the end, you don't feel celebration or relief, just a mixed feeling of what might have been.Dragonslayer is a terrific film. But I'm in no hurry to find it on DVD, with commentaries and extras and maybe added CGI. It's just right the way it was.

Crane shots substituting for dragon POV, nice.The story is the biggest gaffe.  While it is an interesting concept, many individual scenes just don't work.  I find the whole virgin sacrifice concept to be an enormous flaw that not only wrecks a lot of the credibility of the story, but makes it run into cliche.  Take a wild guess as to who the next sacrifice is going to be.The casting is decent, not like I was expecting something marvelous from Disney.  It is interesting to note the enormous use of paganism in the script.  Whether or not this is to add realism, I haven't a clue, but it certainly makes a nice parallel to the priest getting barbecued.  What?  You thought a 10 ton dragon was going to listen to him?Overall, different (certainly by comparison to The Lion King) but should please Tolkien fans that would be repulsed by Conan the Barbarian.  2.5 out of 5 stars.

The king has made an evil pact with the beast by offering virgin sacrifices twice a year in exchange for peace.  These young victims are chosen by lot from the poorer families in the kingdom while the names of important ladies of society are strangely withheld, more especially the king's own daughter!An old classic tale is brought to the silver screen with more respect than most fantasy sword movies.  A very well made film with a great murky atmosphere, exquisuite scenery, great midieval set designs, and breathtaking battle sequences with the most ferocious dragon in cinema history!  So why isn't this movie more popular?One reason for sure is that this movie caters soley to fans of the genre, not to the general public; unlike Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings which was obviously made to appeal to a mass audience.  The makers of Dragonslayer took the subject seriously and concentrated on the story just as much as the special effects (unlike Jackson who slashed most of the story from Tolkien's beautiful masterpiece and made audiences follow the heroes through one big, long obstacle course).  Dragonslayer is a story of death and rebirth.  Of the old things passing away and the start of new beginnings.  A time when magic is fading from the world; dying out.. and the children of men must look to God, religion, and each other for survival (although, I admit, the film portrays wizards and magic in a much more appealing light than Christianity and our Western heritage.  This movie seems to think that being aloof and noncommitted is the road to enlightenment rather than involving oneself in the hypocracy of the community and orginized society).Many have complained that it is slow, boring and drags, but people interested in the subject matter and enjoy seeing a period piece set in the dark ages won't feel that way.  Those who were bored in this film were obviously just watching to see the dragon.  To those people I would recommend Reign of Fire, a movie with plenty of dragons and no story! I wouldn't recommend Dragonheart or Dungeons & Dragons to anybody!The special effects, which were better than Ray Harryhausen's in Clash of the Titans, out that same year (no disrespect to Ray or that movie), are a welcome sight after being bombarded with CGI images in movies such as Fellowship, Two Towers, and the new Star Wars flicks.  Modern movie makers use CGI way too much.  They aren't as realistic as they think they are and should only be used when physical effects won't work.Dragonslayer does have its flaws.  The acting is a bit corny in places and I can't agree with many of the views expressed in the story.  Some I have mentioned already.  I also can't help wondering if Gailin takes Valarian's virginity after the love scene (we're not shown what happens).  If so, this is a poor lesson in ethics on how one should deal with their problems. It makes me wonder why every virgin in the village doesn't get herself laid to avoid becoming dragon dinner.Nevertheless, this is one of my favorite movies of all time, if not my favorite.  It's a sword and sorcery masterpiece.  The story and plotline is what fantasy should be and it looks like something directly out of Time Life's 'The Enchanted World'.  Any real fantasy devotee will love it. Ignore all the bad reviews if you are one of those people and go out and get a copy.Sadly, it is not on DVD, probably because it's one of the darker Disney films that Disney doesn't want it's name connected with anymore (the early stages of Disney's decline from standard family values into to moral depravity).  What ever the reason, this movie is good enough to be on DVD and fans should be allowed to enjoy it in digital, widescreen format.

While indeed it might be too intense and graphic for the youngest of viewers, it's good, straightforward entertainment, directed with style by Matthew Robbins. He wrote the picture with his partner / producer Hal Barwood, and gets fine performances out of a mostly British cast. The music by Alex North is enjoyable, the production design and cinematography are most atmospheric, and the special effects are, for the most part, pretty damn good, having been done in old school, practical fashion.Peter MacNicol, in his feature debut / first starring role, plays Galen, the apprentice to a sorcerer named Ulrich (the great Ralph Richardson). Ulrich is approached by the people of Urland to slay the aged but still potent dragon named Vermithrax Pejorative, who has been terrorizing them for years. They've gone so far as to regularly sacrifice young female virgins to Vermithrax. When Ulrich seems to fail a test, Galen takes it upon himself to accept the challenge of slaying the beast. While hubris does get the better of him at first, his resolve is still impressive.This is quite good fun for any fan of the genre. It benefits from a delightful performance by Richardson, as well as equally engaging work by Sydney Bromley and young MacNicol. (Some people might feel that American actor MacNicol sticks out like a sore thumb, but this viewer doesn't feel that way.) Caitlin Clarke is appealing as Valerian, our brave female lead. John Hallam is a terrific antagonist as Tyrian; Peter Eyre, Albert Salmi, Chloe Salaman, Emrys James, and Roger Kemp all fare well. It's nice to see Ian McDiarmid in the small role of Brother Jacopus, who doesn't last long against the monster.Vermithrax itself is sufficiently scary and majestic, and not entirely unsympathetic, as we can see in one very brief but effective moment.Eight out of 10.

Give it a second chance... you'll see.","Date":"28 February 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":" You have to give credit to Dragonslayer for what it does right; the special effects are quite good, the principal characters are compelling and the story is never predictable. However, in its efforts to turn a medieval wizard & dragon story on its head the movies proves itself to be needlessly dark and depressing. The Kingdom of Urland lives in a constant state of terror because of a 400-year-old dragon named Vermithrax Pejorative and must sacrifice young virgins to it in order to save themselves from a fiery death. Not terribly happy with this deal, the King sends for the last sorcerer to come to the kingdom's aid. What he gets instead is the sorcerer's apprentice. The story follows Galen (Peter MacNicol) who has only limited magical skills, little confidence in himself and all-out hostility from King Even with the help of a young woman (Caitlin Clarke), there isn't much hope for the apprentice, particularly with magic clearly dying out in the world.I'm going to start with the positive aspects of the movie. We have not one, but two characters you can really get attached to and genuinely like. You admire Galen for stepping up to the plate and volunteering to confront the dragon, an opponent who is significantly more powerful than he is but must be stopped. This guy knows he's outmatched so he is forced to use his intelligence to confront the beast, sneaking about its lair, using a mix of conventional and magically-enhanced weapons, and sorcery to take on the dragon. Being young and inexperienced, things seldom go right but he never gives up. Another reason that you like him is because he has to face much more than just the dragon, he has many human opponents as well. The king and his guards, they're total jerks. There are some pretty dark revelations about them that makes you want our young hero to win even more.The other character I really like is the young woman who helps Galen. Her character is essential to the plot because she helps our hero at multiple instances and in fact gets the story moving from the get-go. You would expect her character to be a typical damsel in distress considering the wizard combating the dragon that wants virgins thing, but she's actually a tough character that holds her own and in some ways is much more confident and stronger than our actual hero.I also have to give credit for the film's special effects, particularly whenever you get to see full shots of the dragon Vermithrax. The creature is created with puppetry when it comes to the close-ups (to mixed results) and with stop-motion in the full-length shots. The way the creature is revealed is expertly done, with several shots at the beginning teasing you enough that you want to see more, without showing too much and giving away the best part of the movie (the monster itself) too early. When you do see the dragon, the stop-motion effects used to bring it to life are excellent, some of the best I've seen. It ranks as high as the works of masters Willis O' Brien and Ray Harryhausen. The film also has numerous complex ideas and themes throughout and like I said before, it subverts many stereotypes of the genre so you can't see where the movie is going at any point.That brings me to what works less well with the movie. It's simply so dark. There are so many deaths during the movie that it brings you down. It's not like the deaths I'm complaining about are heroic deaths either, they just feel kind of petty. Sympathetic characters are brutally murdered for no real reason. It's not even to make the villains seem really evil or to add a tragic back story kind of thing, they're just written in to be slaughtered. If the intention was to make the odds against our hero feel overwhelming there was no need to do so. Another major negative point towards the movie is a revelation about Galen's master at the very end. If it had been tweaked just a little bit, where it was discovered by our hero and then implemented by him, it could have been a really clever plot development. To me it felt like a needlessly cryptic revelation that was as bad as those rage-inducing scenes in romantic comedies where the plot could have been solved within 5 minutes if people would actually talk like human beings. It makes you think that a) that wizard was just too lazy to do the whole thing himself b) he really put all his eggs in one basket in hoping nothing would go wrong in this convoluted plan of his and c) that if anyone is to blame because of the fiasco in the kingdom, it's the wizard! The film then ends on a tone that sort of just tells you that your dreams of an awesome, uplifting world where magic, sorcery, beautiful princesses to be rescued and fantastical monsters to be slain by valiant heroes... those are stupid thing to believe in. Get back to reality, because the movie is over buddy!I'm torn with this picture because this is the second time I've seen it and I really didn't like it at first. I thought it was depressing but well made and the ending was bad. I still think that's the case, but there are also many good points and it does make it worth a watch. So here's what I recommend. Watch it once, and think what you want of it, but then watch it a second time, like several months later when you remember the tone of it, but not too many of the details. With lowered expectations and forward knowledge of what happens overall, you will be able to focus your attention on the positive aspects and actually enjoy the film.

I remember first seeing it at the theater having polished British production values and a realistic look and ambiance of fictional storybook medieval sorcery times similar to the first Star Wars movie and Ridley Scott's Legend but with a more lived in look. The extras, supporting cast, costumes, sets and landscape look hand picked and right for the era they were portraying.The plot is so well thought out and imaginative in how it portrays and deals with the menace of the dragon as well as how it ties together commentary on class and socioeconomic issues and a coming of age awareness of its youthful hero. It never drags or becomes long winded or boring. It moves along at a good pace.And Sir Ralph Richardson's minimalist, laid back acting style, commanding voice and bigger than life theatrical aura gives an amazing believability to the plot adding a special ambiance I didn't see in all of the Lord of The Rings flicks. It's the same theatrical ambiance the seasoned actor projects in another high British production value movie, Time Bandits.I remember back then having to watch Dragonslayer several times on cable in order to distinguish listening through British spoken dialog the importance to the plot of the cryptic line... ashes spread on burning water. I've never heard of a plot twist like that. What a cool way to deal with a insurmountable problem.

When I finally bought it I watched it TWICE, something I rarely do.THE STORY A medieval kingdom is harassed by a dragon, apparently the last of its species. The people decide to appease the horrific beast with regular sacrifices of virgin maidens. The virgins are selected through a questionable lottery system. When the King's daughter is picked for sacrifice, the monarch employs a sorcerer's apprentice, Peter MacNicol, to slay the dragon.Dragonslayer takes the Jaws route by not fully showing the beast until well into the second hour of the film. Prior to that revealing moment the film expertly builds up a heap of horrific anticipation concerning the creature. The first virgin sacrifice scene is particularly terrifying. When we finally DO see the monster it's definitely not a let down. Many viewers attest that this dragon is the best dragon to ever appear in film, even though the picture was made in 1981.I've heard some complain that the protagonist, MacNicol, was wrong for the role. Nothing could be further from the truth. He's easy to relate to because he's a flawed human being with naive, boyish qualities, not a larger-than-life superhero (like, say, Conan or Beastmaster). I've also heard some complain that the heroine, Caitlin Clarke, is too man-ish looking. Well, duh, that fits into the whole sacrificial lottery plot. When Caitlin ultimately and uncertainly dons a dress and make-up she's woman enough.The Dark Age sets/costumes/locations really impressed me. If you're in the mood for a top-of-the-line medieval flick with castles, dungeons, forests, villages, fair maidens, kings, sorcerers, etc. this is the one to see.Dragonslayer was an inexplicable flop when it was released in 1981, perhaps due to the glut of similar-themed pictures at the time. Regardless, it can now be treasured on DVD. It took me over 25 years to witness its magnificence but I finally did.GRADE A- "},{"Title":"Dragonslayer","Date":"27 February 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":" Yep back in 1981 Disney were in cahoots with Paramount and the result was this quite dark film. I mean how much more badass could this idea be?! a sorcerers apprentice must come to grips with his powers, learn his trade and save the land from a 400 year old dragon whilst trying to fend off a pesky knight of the realm. Basically its just an excuse for some dragon battling in a time honoured Tolkien way.I haven't seen this film since I was a little kiddie, long before the days of knowing what 'The Lord of the Rings' was anyway. First impressions are how Tolkien-like the visuals actually are. It was all filmed in the wilderness of Wales and the Isle of Skye and it really looks tremendous. The sweeping lush valleys, the green woodlands, the rocky mountainous dragons lair, wide misty lakes and typically traditional old fashioned dank medieval castles. It all looks so damn good visually it doesn't actually look like Wales or the Isle of Skye, it looks too nice!. Some sequences could of been cut out of Ridley Scotts 'Legend', it has that fairy fantasy vibe at times, you half expect some Elves or Dwarf warriors to turn up.Admittedly for a kick ass title like this the film takes it time in delivering some dragon slaying. Most of the time we see the rather odd choice of hero in Peter MacNicol arguing with the King, arguing with the Kings main knight who wears a silly helmet, looking perplexed, attempting magic, getting locked up and finding out that a young boy is actually a young woman. How in the hell he couldn't see this I don't know. The plot about the King holding a lottery that chooses young girls to be sacrificed to the dragon to appease it is pure fairytale stuff (this is why that one woman disguises herself as a bloke). The Princess finds out her father the King has rigged it so she never gets chosen, so she bravely opts to get sacrificed. Somehow the King can't stop this decision even though he's King so its up to MacNicol to save her.Really the whole crux of the film is the last half where MacNicol must fight the dragon with his big dragon slaying spear, his magic shiny ring which he got from his sorcerer Master and dragon scale shield. Its the effects that make this film stand up and get counted, for the time the effects were mind blowing and they ain't half bad now. A classical mix of stop motion, puppets, large scale puppets, bluescreen and some matte paintings bring the dragon to life. I can't deny the visuals do get a bit creaky as the film progresses through to the big confrontation. Bluescreen becomes very obvious, especially against the stop motion dragon, the flying sequences are a bit iffy looking and the stop motion isn't quite as good as I remembered. Its the puppets and large scale dragon heads that take your breathe away, some really nice detail and great fire breathing effects...even if the dragon design is a bit standard and unadventurous.The other thing that hit me was the level of shock factor in this film. We do see poor old Ian McDiarmid get incinerated up close, we do see the Princess get half eaten by baby dragon puppets, one has its mouthful with her foot!, there is a haunting sequence where a young girl gets torched alive (you hear her screams) and we do see someone getting run through with a spear. In short there is a reasonable amount of blood on show here! I was surprised.Its quite a slow film with a lot of character building which is a tad dull but it works. The whole plot to kill the dragon does seem pretty convoluted really, they're messing around with magic rings, spells, resurrection blah blah blah when all you wanna see is MacNicol hack at the dragon with a large sharp weapon. End of the day they kill it with a remotely detonated old sorcerer via the magic ring it seems, kinda made me think why we had to go through everything just to do that. But I guess the old sorcerer had to die to come back as a magical explosive old sorcerer resurrected from the dragons fiery underground lake...whatever.The film appears to be your bog standard fantasy film where the hero must save the Princess from the dragon, but it isn't, the Princess gets eaten!. The plot also feels a bit heavy at times, a bit bloated with magic when really you just wanna see a bit more kickassery, I guess in this day and age a remake would give you that for sure. I can't moan about the plot as it is well done and offers more than just hack n slash, the characters are all pretty good really which isn't expected. This is a fantasy so you half expect high levels of flaming grilled cheese but no, everyone plays it straight and it works well, I especially liked the portrayal and look of 'King Casiodorus'.So no this isn't entirely a silly childish fairytale story, far from it. The visuals may trick you into thinking this at times but its quite a bleak film mostly. For me I just wanted to watch it again for the dragon sequences, there I said it, I'm sure most would be the same truth be told. In that sense the film doesn't disappoint, despite its age the film offers some great draconem action, and yes I did feel sorry for the dragon when its babies got slain by the hero pfft! screw you hero!.6.5/10 "}{"Title":"Dragon Is The Star","Date":"8 December 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":" Mathew Robbins directed this fantasy adventure that stars Ralph Richardson as an aging wizard who, along with his young apprentice(played by Peter MacNicol) answer the plea of a besieged village which has been forced to sacrifice young virgin girls by lottery for many years to appease a dragon.

And I have to say that Dragonslayer (1981) is still a special movie to me.There is not much plot in the movie that is not described in the title. Peter MacNicol plays a sorcerer's apprentice who, when his master is killed before fulfilling a promise to slay a dragon, must attempt to slay the dragon himself.Because it was released at the start of a run of sword-and-sorcery movies produced in the 1980s, Dragonslayer is different from almost every other movie in the genre that followed it. In fact, it is almost unique in movie history.I actually believe that Dragonslayer has more in common with Jaws (1975) than it does with other 1980s fantasy-adventure movies.Director Matthew Robbins, no doubt influenced by Steven Spielberg's directorial techniques in Jaws, introduces the dragon slowly, in fleeting glimpses, before finally revealing it in its entirety after more than an hour of screen time.There is, for example, a great shot from behind a character's head as he slowly rises to his feet with the dragon in front of him, with the dragon's head only just visible around his own.The director also makes clever use of camera angles to suggest that people are constantly in fear of death from above, crouching and even crawling along the ground in apprehension of awakening a sleeping dragon.Like almost all the sword-and-sorcery movies of the 1980s, Dragonslayer is also a triumph of production design. Production Designer Elliot Scott creates a world in which a fire-breathing dragon does not seems out of place. The sorcerer's castle is appropriately dark and dreary, the people live in a village that appears to be little more than sticks and rocks put together, and the dragon's lair, full of fire and steam, is an unforgettable sight.The screenplay has perhaps just the right amount of plot in it, yet I cannot say that it impressed me as much as the direction and production design, because it seems more like a series of clever ideas than a coherent screenplay.I do not want to spoil the movie for those who have not seen it, but I thought it was a clever touch for the hero to use a shield made of the dragon's own scales for protection against its fiery breath. Also, when the hero ventures into the dragon's lair, the dragon is hiding in the last place that you would expect a fire-breathing dragon to hide.Like many other movies of the genre, Dragonslayer does suffer from a bit of an identity crisis. Is this a movie for adults or for children? Obviously few people over the age of twelve care about the slaying of a dragon, yet the unrelenting grim and serious tone of the work suggests an ambition to be more than just a kids' movie. This tone is maintained so completely that the jokey, lighthearted ending seems out of place, compared to everything that has preceded it.The screenplay also suffers from some awkward moments of transition, as when the hero, after battling the dragon, appears outside the dragon's lair, with no explanation as to how he escaped or survived. The myth of Saint George and the Dragon, which provided most of the source material for the screenplay, suffers from the same abrupt transitions, if I remember correctly, yet the screenplay should have improved upon the flaws in the source material.I also cannot praise the movie as an actors' showcase, especially since Sir Ralph Richardson, obviously the best actor in the movie and giving one of his last performances, is on screen the least amount of time. The other performances are merely serviceable, nothing more.I would give this movie 7 out of 10, because if you are a fan of fantasy movies then the movie is definitely worth seeing at least once. If you are not a fan of fantasy movies, then you might give the movie only 5 out of 10, as its good points would not be as meaningful to you.I have to admit that I have no idea how people today, accustomed to Lord of the Rings and other lavishly produced computer-generated spectacles, would view this movie. I would like to think that the movie has held up better than many other movies that rely upon special effects, thanks to its production design, and Alex North's atmospheric musical score, yet maybe this is not enough for viewers today.Perhaps the greatest praise that I can give this movie is that, at least for me, it is memorable and unique.This movie should always have a place in movie history, if only for its special effects. It was released the same year (1981) as Ray Harryhausen's last special effects movie, the original Clash of the Titans, and introduced a new stop-motion technique, go-motion, which would be the special effects-industry standard for the next twelve years, until Jurassic Park was released in 1993 and made all stop-motion effects seem obsolete.It would be easy to dismiss Dragonslayer as merely a footnote in the history of fantasy and special-effects movies, but I would prefer to think that, when viewed today, it still succeeds in transporting the audience to another time and place and makes them believe the impossible.

The name makes it sound like a formulaic movie about a fantasy hero fulfilling his destiny, but that is not so. This movie is interesting because it is different, it has so many nice little bits which are out of the ordinary.A formula movie would involve the part where the villains are winning, the part where the heroes are training, the part where the heroes kick ass. Most of this movie involves the heroes not really knowing what to do or how to do it, just trying their best with mixed results. And the antagonists are all multi-dimensional, none are evil for the sake of being evil. Basically the movie is a play on the standard fantasy hero movie. But it is not a parody or critique of the genre; this movie is unusual in being much more subtle. It is simply about things being more complex than may appear on the surface. This artistic choice can at times make the movie seem unpolished and not tight, but I think it is interesting.I've always liked the character development of the female lead. The dragon is great, especially the fire-breathing. The theme of the decline of magic is an interesting background element thrown into the movie. And the slow pacing and periodic focus on natural scenery make the movie feel both more realistic and more grand at the same time.The movie is hardly perfect. I'm not a huge fan of the male lead's performance. And you need a good attention span because parts of the movie run slow. But there is a lot to like about this movie.

I thought Ralph Richardson, John Hallam, and Caitlin Clarke had the strongest performances in the movie while Peter MacNicol, although energetic, doesn't quite fit the role. The music at times is good, but at other times out-of-place. Much of the cinematography is beautiful including backdrops of Scotland. Summarizing, the film seems a bit aloof, and sets up a standard romance - however the winning aspects of the movie are it's look and it's recreation of an Old World Society, Rulership, and melding of black arts (magic), sacrifice, and lottery (apparently mocking it).

A delegation is sent without the consent of the King to enlist a sorcerer to end the threat of the dragon.Our protagonist is a young apprentice magician named Galen (Peter MacNicol) who feels responsible for removing the threat of a dragon after his master Ulrich, (Ralph Richardson who was almost 80 at the time) the sorcerer who had undertaken the task dies proving his abilities.Despite being made at a time with much more limited Special Effects capabilities the film makers manage to produce a dragon that is still amongst the most effective presentations of such a creature on film. Admittedly the glimpses of creature are for the most part fleeting which echoes the approach taken by Steven Spielberg in making Jaws. Thus a potential limitation raised by the technical capabilities can be used very effectively.The result of this craftsmanship combined with a compelling story and effective performances is a very well made sword and sorcery film. This may not be a profound cinematic experience and it may be a little dark especially for children but in that context it is extremely enjoyable.The film was both written and directed by Mathew Robbins who has served as a screenwriter for his friend Steven Spielberg.The film was nominated for two Oscars, in Visual Effects and Score.Surprisingly to some the movie was co-produced by Disney despite the more mature and dark tone than was there standard. The film was marginally unsuccessful at the box office but had considerable success in the burgeoning home video market.

The movie itself may be quite a bit cheesy in 2007, maybe the acting is a bit over-the-top, but the Dragon alone makes this movie worth watching.To bad none of the available RC1 or RC2 DVDs do contain any Extra-Material on how they created this great illusion...

A special effects type of movie from the old days required a huge allotment of specialized individuals to make the 'monster' or other deemed effect. Much like the older cartoons from MGM, Warner Bros, even Disney, and others; took the artist a lot of time, skill, patience, dedication, and above all, respect; to make the final cut that would enlighten individuals from all age groups. Rather than the 'Jap-animation' or similar quick-cut type of techniques that are used nowadays, the cartoons and animations, including all types of special effects, always brought with it a high regard of respect and, just plain old thanks, job well done from the various crowd of admirers. One of the earlier comment writer even made the comparison to the dragon of Dragonheart as a special effects flop over the compared to the one from Dragonslayer.A short side note here as most f the comments have suggested, the acting, plot, ironies, settings and sceneries, and of course the movie itself; all were superb.the movie was nominated for how many awards? Enough said; as far as fantasy is concerned, this one is definitely a keeper and a must in anyone's collection. It is not close or even on par with the Lord of the Rings movies, but it should be close behind it on the rack.

Yet it is really its own movie, and a very different film than most others of the genre and era. Peter MacNicol (Ghostbusters II; Addams Family Values; and, I guess, Sophie's Choice) gives a fantastic performance as Galen, an ambitious and cocky apprentice to a sorcerer (the always-great Sir Ralph Richardson) who has been hired to slay Vermithrax, a brutal dragon.Great performances highlight this film from its other major stars, as well as a fantastically realized cache of creatures. The music by Alex North rivals his work in earlier films (such as Cleopatra and Spartacus), and Derek Vanlint's cinematography fully deserved an Oscar for its darkly colorful splendor. Despite a few minor bumps in the road early on, the movie very quickly blossoms into a full-on treat.

I have to think the people who say this never actually saw the movie. This is an intelligent, well-scripted, well-acted, well-paced film, with excitement and suspense to spare, and it makes you think. The dragon Vermithrax is beautifully realized with go-motion photography, giving it a fluid and realistic movement that is equal and in some ways better than any CGI you've ever seen. I haven't seen Eragon yet, but I have a feeling Dragonslayer is probably a much better movie.The movie portrays the king and his enforcer, Tyrian, as ruthless men, but not as overtly evil ... they honestly believe they are doing the right thing by the kingdom and its people. One gets a sense that the king initiated the lottery out of sheer desperation but over time was corrupted by it as the nobles and wealthy commoners paid large sums into the royal coffers to keep their daughters' names out and as (spoiler warning) he hypocritically kept his own daughter's name off the lists.I can't believe some people say that someone other than Peter MacNichol, such as Tom Cruise, should have been cast as Galen. They say MacNichol doesn't look heroic enough. Duh! That was the whole point of the casting. Galen is not supposed to look like you'd expect a dragonslayer to look. The other characters get a look at him and don't expect much of him, and the audience isn't supposed to either.SPOILER About the only problem I have with this movie is that it's impossible to believe no one would ever have realized the blacksmith's son, Valerian, was really a girl.

The story takes a loong time to get going, and after Sir Ralph leaves the stage it seems even looonger. Peter Macnicol does his best but is miscast, too bad Tom Cruise didn't do this instead of Legend. Plus for an hour the flick is dark and gloomy in every way possible, unleavened by the least hint of humor or glimmer of light. Barwood and Robbins (who BTW were 2 of the first pilots off the mother ship in CE3K) patterned their story too closely after Star Wars and Jaws (the latter no doubt because of the expense of the fx). They take too long to get to the dragon and what precedes her ain't all that involving. The characters, with the exception of Tyrian (John Hallam) the king's hit-man, are just too bland. Ah, but then we get to Herself--Vermithrax Pejorative (rude worm-belly?), the greatest dragon of all, even now. This is one mean mother of a Wyrm. She don't talk, she don't sing or dance or hot-cha-cha. But she flies and breathes fire and is totally believable. And, most miraculously, she saves the flick. One little motion she does after dive-bombing Sir Ralph sold me for good she cranes that long neck for a look back. The entire battle between the Sir and the dragon is amazing, even now. The beginning is straight out of Fantasia with Sir Ralph calling up the wind and storm in almost exactly the same way Mickey did in The Sorceror's Apprentice. Most of all (remember this was 1981 and we were still wowed by Harryhausen's dragon in 1958's 7th Voyage of Sinbad) the dragon was totally natural, totally fluid, its flight more believable than Chris Reeve's in Superman. And when it's destroyed, and falls from the sky like a crashing B-29--whew! After that I didn't mind all the religio-political guff that followed. Great horse, though. Oh, and one more thing--didja pipe the Sith Emperor as the priest who gets fried? Can't really recommend the flick unless you're patient and into serious dragonage.

An incredible accomplishment considering the year it came out (1981).  Every time I see the film, I find myself wishing that Vermithrax (the dragon) had received more on-screen time, yet the moderate exposure of the dragon actually added to its mystique, making it even more realistic.  And I wonder if that was not the intent of the director - to make you want more of an already great thing.  Well, I do want more... I want a sequel!!!  But then again, on second thought, maybe not... because I'd hate to see the reputation of this fine film dragged through the mud by what would most likely be a lesser sequel.

A friend and I had emerged from Grauman's Chinese Theater, after being bludgeoned by the excesses of Spielberg's mega-hit, Raiders of the Lost Ark.  I must have shared my friend's stupefaction that evening and when we determined that Dragonslayer was about to begin in a few minutes across the street, we chanced that it might be an antidote to our unwillingness to join the hoi polloi who thought that Raiders was the best adventure movie of all time.  We weren't sorry.  Other comments here (at least the positive ones) echo my sentiments.  I'd just add that I've long been a fan of Alex North's acerbic style of movie scoring and I thought his contribution contributed a great deal to the dread and sense of a time long ago that the filmmakers attempted.  And, of course, the wonderful Sir Ralph Richardson, despite the brevity of his role, gave the film a stamp of acting majesty, undiminished by Peter MacNicol's rather wan personification of the wizard's apprentice.

A previous comment identified the reason - the excellence of the stop-motion photography. The ILM people who did this work created a method of adding blur to each frame of the stop-motion photography, thus eliminating the jerkiness characteristic of even the previous best efforts in the field, Ray Harryhausen's films. In addition, the film boasts some excellent acting, and a kind of mocking self-consciousness about being a fairy-tale. Only the cloud and flying effects are a little twee. Best scene Peter MacNichol descending underground to confront the dragon in the middle of a lake, and using his shield (made of dragon scales) to ward off the flames.

Unfortunately, the vast majority of fantasy novels on bookshelves today really aren't worth the time it takes to read them.  Much the same can be said for fantasy films.  Most are simply poorly conceived, wannabe epics.Not so with -Dragonslayer-.  Serious fantasy must create a pervasive sense of mood and assist the viewer in suspending disbelief.  Most fantasy flicks fail to do this, but -Dragonslayer- does not.  Although the film is far from perfect, it does a fairly good job creating a believable, bleak, medieval setting and then populating it with interesting (if occasionally overdone) characters and an extremely well-crafted dragon to boot.  Although it can be argued that the film lacks creativity to a certain degree (let's admit it--the hero vs. dragon concept goes back at least to -Beowulf-), it makes up for this with a sustained and believable mood.  The result is an entertaining spectacle.All of which is to say, if you're up for a watchable fantasy film, you won't go wrong with -Dragonslayer-.

The magician accepts the task of killing the fierce creature, but goes about his business in a very strange manner which turns out to be a real challenge for his apprentice. Besides from having a good plot Dragonslayer is a technical marvel. The dragon is grim, beautiful and very well made. It is created with a mixture of full scale models and stop-motion photage, and when you consider the fact that is was made in 1981 you can hardly believe your eyes.

Dragonslayer is a smart step ahead of an average Disney fairy tale. In some ways it does not resemble one at all. Writer/director Mathew Robbins, takes a classic archetype (dashing hero, must rescue damsel in distress from savage beast) and stretches the concept into something a little less basic, and a little more convincing. He also constructs the film in such a way that it looks and sounds very real. While special effects have come quite a ways since Dragonslayer, this dragon is just as well designed as any monster from a movie today. It does not look like a big hunk of fabricated rubber, it actually looks like a dragon with scales and claws and the whole package. To help generate the illusion, Robbins chooses his angles carefully. We seldom see the whole creature in frame, we only see parts. Among other things, this trick makes the beast look larger. Just occasionally we see the whole body in frame which is generated by less convincing digital go-motion, but it works.The world in which the creature dwells is also well designed. Every set is carefully built to look dirty and murky like the Dark Ages were. Nothing is ever shiny and clean, like it was in Excalibur. From what I have described, you'd think that nothing could go wrong with Dragonslayer, yet something does. The problem comes down to how the story is concluded. When the movie approaches its final act, it has the potential for a great climax. What we get is a mediocre one. Robbins takes the fantasy a bit far and uses magic as an excuse for Deus ex Machina, a sudden turn of events which not only makes the remaining story feel weird but it spoils the chance for excitement. Another diminishing factor is the overuse of blue screen photography and stop motion. In small does, these effects were okay, but the final confrontation sequence looks utterly fake. Dragon movies are rare, which is why it is good to see a film like this every now and then. Some have been more entertaining than others, but it feels like Dragonslayer could've been the best. Some patience and thought went into the screenplay, but a little more was needed. The film has everything else though.

The medieval settings are large-scale yet appropriately grim and the production - a collaboration between Paramount and Disney - hired a crew that was clearly homogeneous to the subject matter cinematographer Derek Vanlint (from ALIEN 1979), production designer Elliot Scott, composer Alex North (who nabbed an Oscar nod for his score here), and among the endless list of special effects technicians, Dennis Muren and Phil Tippett. The cast list was also a healthy mix of veterans (Ralph Richardson, Albert Salmi), character actors (Sydney Bromley, Ian McDiarmid) and newcomers (Peter MacNicol, his debut film). The dragon, too, is quite a wonderful - and scary - creation (although, I couldn't help thinking that, if this was ever to be remade, it would invariably be about 10 times larger...but the plot itself, curiously enough, wasn't nearly as compelling as I had envisaged - making the film highly watchable but also rather unmemorable.

The story has a town and castle plagued by a dragon, people go to search for I think a wizard to help them get rid of said dragon. Well for some reason or other a man stabs said wizard and the wizard dies and they are now just left with the apprentice. The town holds a lottery and whose ever name is drawn is sacrificed to the dragon. Only females are drawn though.

Putting the painful performances aside, this is a rather enjoyable dark fantasy movie; definitely flawed, but interesting enough to be worth seeing all the way through. It does tend to get quite bizarre from time to time, such as when MacNicol's apprentice uses magic to strip his 70+ male buddy down to his undies, but the brilliant acting of Ralph Richardson as the token wise wizard and Return of the Jedi's Ian McDiarmid as a manic man of the lord (his short scene is easily the best of the movie) make up for it. Most importantly - and this is why I gave it such a high rating considering its numerous flaws - Dragonslayer features the coolest dragon I have ever seen in a movie. Many viewers will sneer at the primitive effects, but they can't deny that the design, style and craft which went into making the beast are all impeccable. Personally, I prefer the stop-motion technique herein to out-of-place cartoons that sound like British agents.I'd also like to add that the grand finale where the token wise wizard does battle with the dragon on top of a mountain is quite impressive, especially considering that director Matthew Robbins' only previous experience came from a summer romance movie starring Mark Hamill. Overall, Dragonslayer isn't a great movie in any way, or even a classic of its kind, but it is a cult movie, and a must-see for dragon enthusiasts as the dragon is quite brilliant.

The special effects were way ahead of its time.  The only downfall of this movie was the casting.  I didn't think Peter MacNicol was right for the lead role.  He just wasn't, I don't know, masculine enough.  However, I did respect his performance.  Another casting error, was Caitlin Clarke as Valerian.  Even though her character is a girl disguised as a boy, she just wasn't attractive enough; and for some reason I didn't like her voice.  But all of that aside, a great picture.

Valerian asks Ulrich to kill a Dragon that has been terrorising their homeland for years, oh & this Dragon seems to have a name too Vermithrax Pejorative. Their King, Casiodorus Rex (Peter Eyre) has made a pact with the Dragon in which a teenage virgin girl is given as sacrifice, an arrangement which the villagers aren't particularly happy about. Ulrich agrees. As they are about to set off for Urland the King's soldiers arrive, lead by bad guy Tyrian (John Hallman). Basically Ulrich ends up dead and it's up to Galen to take responsibility & use the knowledge Ulrich has given him & a magical amulet to lead the villagers to Urland & defeat the Dragon, Vermithrax (that's a great sounding word you know, just say it out loud a few times!) The Dragon lives in an underground cave & upon arrival Galen causes a land-side which blocks the entrance to the cave, hopefully trapping Vermithrax and killing it. Things don't go as Galen had hoped, Vermithrax breaks free & attacks the village. The King decides to hold another lottery to choose a sacrificial virgin, which he soon regrets as his daughter Princess Elspeth (Chloe Salaman) is drawn. Armed with a magical spear made by Valerian's Father, the local Blacksmith (Emrys James) Galen sets out for one final confrontation with Vermithrax to the death!Co-written & directed by Matthew Robbins I thought Dragonslayer was a pretty good fantasy/horror/adventure film. The script by Robbins & Hal Barwood who also acted as producer, is well paced has decent characters & has a few plot twists & turns. One thing that confuses me a little about Dragonslayer though is who exactly is it meant to be aimed at? I would say it's a little strong & perhaps a little bit scary for very young children & with all the melodramatics & slightly off beat 'olden' dialogue I'm not sure youngsters would be very interested in seeing it through to the end anyhow as it's close to 2 hours long. As for adults it's a little slow & doesn't feature any real blood, gore or violence worth mentioning & a lack of any big action sequences mean I'm not sure the average adult would be totally satisfied either. I think maybe Robbins wanted to create a very serious & dark Medieval fantasy but perhaps Disney wanted something for children, thus ending up a little between the both. Having said that Dragonslayer still works very well as a film overall. The production & costume design are both fantastic, the widescreen cinematography by Derek Vanlint of the Scottish & Welsh filming locations with their lush, harsh greenery and jagged mountain peaks give Dragonslayer a really nice feel throughout. Technically the film is top-notch with some excellent special effects that bring the ferocious fire-breathing Vermithrax to life during the final 20 or so minutes. Although it's screen time is quite limited until the end, Vermithrax as a creature just looks right, it's bodily proportions and movement seem very natural. Some of the special effects obviously fall a little flat these days but for the most part they hold up extremely well. The acting is OK by all involved but one or two of the characters seemed a little thin & sketchy. Overall I'd say Dragonslayer is a worthwhile film & I enjoyed it, having said that I'm not sure how many other people would share my sentiments. I don't think I know anyone who whose interest would be maintained throughout, which is a shame. Difficult to recommend but I will anyway, give it a chance & you may like it.

The story and special effects were both ahead of their time but there was a certain priest floating around that changed the fate of the Star Wars universe forever. He was burnt to a cinder in this flick but his young apprentice, Vader, was burnt almost beyond recognition in the last Star Wars film. If you haven't got it by now...you never will.It reminds me of a young Ian McKellan in The Keep. I was impressed with his performance there but no one gave it much thought because of the film.

Peter MacNicol stars in an early 80's film that drags on until the dragon is killed. Ok special effects for the early 80's, then again they suck now for today's audience. A decent story with some interesting characters that go nowhere with their identities. Could have used more plot, but then again, if you've seen one dragon slayer movie you've seen them all.

I did not think the The humor was that funny, and I thought that the music got kind of annoying as well. However, I do recommend this movie because of its really good special effects. This movie would look really nice on DVD, And fans of stop-motion must see this. I don't know why it is not on DVD yet, since it did win several Oscar nominations. I guess it is okay overall, but the performances could have been better. Only worth your time for the special effects. "},{"Title":"I'm in the minority again.  I thought this film was sloppy.","Date":"26 December 2004","Score":"7 out of 18 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":" There's no real need to go into yet another synopsis of the plot. It's already been gone over many times already by others. My issue is how virtually everyone glosses over the shoddy work done on this film.*MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD* but nothing that ruins the climax or ending of the film.This movie takes little time in getting off to a sloppy start. The leader of the group of travelers was obviously a woman. The fact that not a single other person in her village realized that after like, um, a quarter of a century is preposterous. Less than 24 hours after meeting Galen her cover is blown by our protagonist. That was fast.Where was the father of the baby dragons? It irked me that it wasn't even made an issue of. I mean...was he out terrorizing some other village? If so, then why was this one specific dragon so important to kill? How did our hero know exactly how many babies there were so that he knew that he had slaughtered them all? Would it have killed the makers of the film to at least briefly and maybe even humorously discuss the solution to not qualifying as a virgin sacrifice for the dragon? I realize women were more demure back then but come on...the choice between premarital sex or being charbroiled alive by a dragon seems like a no-brainer to me.What about that shield he hid behind when fighting the dragon? It obviously didn't cover him completely yet he wasn't affected in the slightest by the massive flames shooting out of the dragon's mouth. Was it magic? I dunno. What finally made me groan with disgust was when Galen came face-to-face with the dragon and just stood there. Then he runs away and tries to get out of the dragon's cavern. What the...?!! Didn't he have a little something called A PLAN when he went down there to slay the dragon? Geez.To make things worse, the dragon looked different from scene to scene and sometimes even changed quite a bit form shot to shot. I know effects in 1981 were the Dark Ages compared to today but it seemed as if even ILM couldn't make most of the dragon scenes believable (although I freely admit a couple of scenes looked impressive.) The whole romantic angle of the film was sorely lacking as well. There was virtually no development of the relationship and it just seemed to be there as if it were a requirement.I could go on but I don't want to nitpick. Having seen thousands of films, I have yet to ever see even one perfect film. Even my favorite of all-time has some problems with it. However, I do expect certain things such as a plot without gaping holes, actual character development and, if you're going to make a film of this nature, high quality special effects. This film strikes out on all three of those counts and Dragonslayer just slowly limps along until its already forgone conclusion. Sorry...that's just how I see it. 2/10 "}{"Title":"ROAR!!!...

She is, hands down, the most interesting character in the movie.  She also doesn't show up until the final half-hour or so.  It's worth it to get the movie and fast-forward to her scenes.  She's one of the last stop-motion animated characters created by Phil Tippet, who has since moved on to CGI.

These are not disbelief-suspension issues (i.e. I'm not talking about the fact that there are no such things as dragons, or magic)--all of these are stupidity issues. The plot makes no sense as a result, and the film is a miserable failure.The lead actor, Peter MacNicol, appears to be a total cheeseball. Even if the movie made sense, it would be unwatchable because of him.The special effects are nothing special. I am familiar with special effects of 1981, and they were nothing special by that year's standards either. By 2007 standards they are laughable.The good reviews here are baffling. This is obviously a failure. Here is an example of a truly bad film. One of the few films to which I have given a 1 out of 10, but this one truly deserves it.Do not waste your time or money with this. Any other fantasy film you can think of is probably much better than this one. "}]
