[{"Title":"Highly underrated","Date":"18 April 2004","Score":"61 out of 70 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  This film is terribly misrepresented by critics.  True, it is not an insightful social critique.  It is not a moving analysis of human nature. It is not a philosophical masterpiece.  But it makes no pretensions to be any of these things.  Hero is pure Hollywood, and is the very best of what Hollywood means, or meant at the time.  The plot is clever, the writing is witty, the characters are interesting, and the acting is decent (Dustin Hoffman is great).  The development is not meant to expose new subtleties of human emotion, but rather strongly to evoke obvious ones -- in this case, pride.  In other words, it is meant to make you happy.  That is not to say that the audience is barraged with heavy-handed judgments, merely that it does not require a degree in theater to like the film.  It is interesting enough to be enjoyable after several viewings, but not subtle enough to require serious study.Hero is perfect for the intelligent moviegoer who wants to watch a film for fun, and that is the context in which it should be understood.  It is Hollywood at its best.

One of the survivors is Gale Gayley (Geena Davis), a glamorous news reporter, whose TV station decides to offer $1 million for an exclusive interview with the mysterious Angel of Flight 104, who simply disappeared into the dark of the night before his act of bravery could be recognized, leaving one of his shoes behind amid the chaos.However, the Mr Cinderella who subsequently steps forward to claim the reward, and thereafter becomes lionized by both the media and the public, is not Laplante (rather inconveniently locked up in jail at the time), but John Bubber (Andy Garcia), a handsome, charismatic, though destitute Vietnam veteran, who intends to share his new-found wealth with the city's homeless and other charitable causes.  Bubber is able to convince as the real hero, because he gave Laplante a lift immediately after the accident (and is handed Laplante's second shoe as a thank-you, to pay for the gas), and thus heard the full story of Laplante's adventure firsthand.British director Stephen Frears' third American outing (following 1988's DANGEROUS LIAISONS and 1990's THE GRIFTERS) was not a particular success at the box-office, and neither was it especially well-received critically. But I find that difficult to understand, as I think that HERO is probably the most downright enjoyable of all Frears' movies.  The three leads are terrific - Davis looks sensational, Hoffman is suitably sleazy (and unexpectedly moving in scenes with his ex-wife, played by Joan Cusack, and his young son, James Madio), and Garcia injects his impostor role with warmth and credibility.  The script (by the screenwriter of BLADE RUNNER and UNFORGIVEN) is bright and snappy, and there are fun, uncredited cameos from Chevy Chase (as Davis's pushy boss), Edward Herrmann (as a suicide victim - in a comedy? but yes it IS funny) and Fisher Stevens (as a film director, making a TV movie of the plane crash and using the real survivors as the actors).HERO was known as ACCIDENTAL HERO (a more appropriate title, in my opinion) in various territories (including the UK), echoing, of course, one of Davis's earlier film triumphs, namely Lawrence Kasdan's splendid THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST (1988).  This was also where Davis reunited with Hoffman, 10 years after the former made her brief film debut in the latter's cross-dressing smash TOOTSIE.  Finally, the excellent song played over the end credits is Heart Of A Hero, written and performed by Luther Vandross.

Watch they boy from the plane. He can't remember what the hero said, so he is proud and excited to come up with what he thinks will sound good.

I've always admired his work and once again he proves to be a very talented actor with this movie.This time he's playing Bernie Laplante, a little criminal who hasn't really had much luck in recent times. He's constantly having a fight with his ex over his son, he lives in a miserable apartment, he drives an incredibly old car... But than a plane crashes just right in front of his nose. And even though he has always been described as antisocial, he saves the lives of 54 people by opening the airplane's door and helping everybody out.One of the people he has saved is a TV reporter. She immediately sees a good story in it and wants to interview him. But because she, nor her news station know who he is, they will give him one million dollar in return for an interview. All they know is that he has lost a size 10 shoe in the mud. Of course hundreds of people claim to be him, but one homeless guy, who got the other shoe from him, really can make them believe he's the true hero. He gets the million and makes up a beautiful story on how he all did it. Of course Bernie sees this (when he is in jail) and decides to confront the man with the truth.This movie may not appeal to everybody, because not everybody may appreciate this kind of humor. Personally I find this a very good satire, that has actually a good point. In their search for sensational, touching news, TV stations will do really everything and seem to forget that the most important thing is still reality.

And as a big plus, Dustin Hoffman is the star!  He's one of my favorite actors, and I'm eager to see him in anything.  He gives a fine, underrated performance that's both funny and touching, in an unpretentious way.  His character of Bernie Laplante is no angel.  He's rude, cranky and selfish.  But he loves his son very much, and simply has trouble expressing his true emotions.  It's always fun to see a serious actor in a comic role.  And the advantage of it is serious actors approach comic roles in the same way they do any other roles.  Like Gene Wilder said, I approach the role of Leo Bloom in 'The Producers' the same way Olivier would approach 'Hamlet.'  Hoffman doesn't act goofy or ham it up, but simply plays it straight and lets the laughs come to him with his natural delivery.  Andy Garcia delivers an endearing performance, and Joan Cusack is amusing as Hoffman's ex-wife.  The plot is predictable and some of the characters are cliched, but overall the film is entertaining and at times moving.

The camera makes everyone act weird because it scares them or it turns them on. I think what puts off most viewers is the syrupy music, heroic, uplifting, telling people how to feel and I can feel myself being manipulated. I personally think it's a very, very sly choice. It goes to show I can't believe anything I see in the news, and I can't believe this movie either, because it's manipulating me too by telling me not to believe. My son watched it, and I asked him, okay, who's the hero? The jerk who saves hundreds of people or the the liar who, when given the chance, goes forth to inspire and help people anyway? Both of them are undercut by their actions. I guess they both are. And I guess none of our heroes are really clean. They probably hide some sins in their pasts.

The main protagonist, Bernard Laplante (played by Dustin Hoffman), a down-on-his-luck thief, is about to be sent to prison as a consequence for his many failed wrong-doings (credit card scams, etc). Though he may appear to be a no-good, cursing, emotionless human being, in actuality, he is a kind, sensitive soul with heroic traits residing inside of him. His countenance may suggest a weak, greedy man to the audience at first, but as the story progresses, the viewer is able to see how contrary that image is to the real Bernie. One rainy day,Bernie is minding his own business, pretty much contemplating how to dodge his prison sentence, when out of nowhere, a burning plane crashes down in front of him. With no one else to rescue the trapped passengers inside, Bernie does the unexpected and saves the lives of those on board. Being one who doesn't like to be bothered much, he manages to get everyone off board (while complaining of course). Unfortunately,with all the smoke and fire around, no one gets a detailed look at the mysterious hero that vanishes. Not one who likes attention, Berniedoesn't mention anything until he hears there's a monetary award supplied by a news channel for the life-saver if he/she comes forward.At this point, the story takes a similar form in the tale of the boy who cried wolf. No matter how loud and repetitive he is, Bernie fails to gain recognition and acceptance as the miracle hero.I only have positive things to say about this movie. The acting (see the scene where Bernie searches for his lost shoe), the touching moments, and funny plot makes this a strong movie in all aspects.

The speech represents the entire story that is like a modern day Aesop fable. Dustin Hoffman plays small time criminal who accidentally saved the life of 54 people when the plane crash landed in front of him, but someone else took the credit. Our life is basically conditioned to think that people should be given credit where credit is due, in real life, credit isn't given where credit is due. The other problem about events or historical events is that life is like an onion. When you peel them all away, nothing is really there. Things we view as hero may be not we think it is, because of our prejudices in what we view them as a perfect hero. A real hero may have none of that, we humans are full of gray areas, some we are good, some we are not so good. There's not such thing as 100% good guys and 100% bad guys. So if you have to watch this movie, what we know what we see, is not what we think it is. If you should die one day, become a spirit, you will realize that everything we hold dear and true, we're not even close. That's the Aesop of the movie.

Bernie is a self obsessed, miserable guy, who thinks everyone is out to get him and is constantly moaning. One day on the way to pick up his son to take the kid to the cinema, Bernie is stopped by a plane crash. Walking inside to rescue everyone, whilst simultaneously cursing and swearing that he's lost his shoes, Bernie is a hero. Walking off however, nobody knows who this mystery hero is. That is, until John Bubba (Andy Garcia) steps forward with one of Bernie's shoes. Taking on this role of idol and inspiration for the nation, John is instantly transformed into a modern messiah. Understandably Bernie is not happy about this and as John's life gets better and better, Bernie's goes in the opposite direction.This film is a bit of a strange one really. With a lot of hidden criticism and satire for how the media obsesses over certain hero figures, it hits the target, at times making us grimace about how true to life it can be. At the same time however, despite it's negative outlook on life, it is simultaneously a feel good film which shows us that even the most negative people in the world can do something incredibly positive. With Hoffman as this pessimist, it adds an element of humour to the proceedings, whilst Garcia appears to represent the man who has tried to play the media and social games but is failing. Finally, adding Geena Davis to the mix as the news story obsessed Gale Gayley, the creators present us with a character who is so happy about this feel good story, that she refuses to accept the truth until countless different clues have been presented to her.With all the media attention placed on Garcia's character, this film is at it's satirical best. The secondary, more enjoyable story regarding around Hoffman is wonderful, but it's the constant television exclusives and the cameras following Garcia around constantly which is the best part.Hero is a clever film. It combines the pessimistic and the optimistic in a suitable manner whilst satirising the american media. Admittedly it's perhaps not as funny as it could be, but Hoffman works as hard as he can to put in a brilliant performance. If someone was to watch this movie, they'd probably come out of it feeling as pessimistic about life as Hoffman, whilst simultaneously feeling optimistic.

He's a two-bit crook and his chickens are finally coming home to roost, that is, he will be sent to prison. However, his young lawyer secures him a week to get his affairs in order. This includes saying goodbye to his ten year old son, Joey, ditto to his ex-wife, Ev (Joan Cusack) and getting his boss to write a letter of recommendation for him before sentencing. However, one night, chaos reigns. Bernie is supposed to take his son to the movies but, in a severe thunderstorm, a plane goes down right in front of Mr. LaPlante. The door to the aircraft is blocked and a fire has started. Unbelievably, Bernie gets the door open and rescues the passengers, including hotshot reporter Gale (Geena Davis). After doing this heroic act, however, LaPante quietly heads over to his son's house. Its way too late, as Eve informs him, and she sends him packing. On the way home, further trouble arrives when his car breaks down and he must hitch a ride from homeless vet John Bubber (Andy Garcia). It is there that Bernie tells John about his courageous act, with John duly impressed. As Bernie has only one shoe from the ordeal, he leaves it with Bubber for a one-legged man of John's acquaintance. Ho, ho! Soon the press and Gale, especially, is looking for the hero and they offer a reward of a MILLION BUCKS to help entice him into the limelight. However, Bernie has set up another crooked meeting and gets whisked off to jail. Its John, instead, who comes forward, for he has the Cinderfeller shoe that matches the one the press has found. Now, everyone believes Bubber is the hero, and in all sincerity, his former past as a hero of Vietnam is revealed, along with other charitable acts. But, once Bernie is sprung on bail one last time, will he spoil the story by giving the press the real scoop about which one of them is the true hero? This is a terrific movie that belongs on a list of 100 best films. It is intelligent, humorous, and very relevant. The cast, too, is superlative, with Hoffman giving one of his best performances ever as the grumpy, law-bending Bernie. Davis, Garcia, Cusack, an uncredited Chevy Chase and all of the others are great, too. The direction of Stephen Frears is also topnotch while the script, sets, costumes, and camera work are fantastic as well. In short, this one is a genuine keeper for the ages.

In Hoffman's film the main character is a sleaze who's philosophy is do unto other before they get a chance to do unto you. Ritter, on the other hand is a nice guy who is seduced by the glory of being heroic. Hoffman spends most of the movie trying to avoid recognition for his heroic acts while Ritter becomes caught up in a scheme to capitalize on people's need for heroes. Both men's lives are held up as evidence that all of us have the capacity to be a hero under the right circumstances. Both films are inspiring with important things to say. Hero At Large however is a small film while Hero is a big budget film with major actors. I thoroughly enjoyed both but by comparison, Hero beats you over the head with its message.

It was not what I expected. You know that it is about a jerk who ends up saving lives and someone else gets the credit for it. As the film rolls by, we learn all about Bernie LaPlante(Hoffman). How he is constantly thinking of himself and ways to screw others so he can get what he wants. Basically, he is a REAL A**. So when his homeless buddy, John Bubber(Garcia), assumes his hero's shoes we don't care that Bernie missed out. Bubber is what we all think a hero should be, a kind thoughtful and giving person. Even though he gets the million dollars reward, he is STILL thinking of helping others. What a great guy! Right?? But he IS a liar!! Stealing the limelight and money away from Bernie. Who cares?Learning that Bubber has taken his hero status and money from him, he gets upset. We think we know what he wants. To take it all away from Mr. Nice Guy Bubber. When he finally confronts Bubber and tells him what he wants, his request is really quite thoughtful. It really shouldn't matter what kind of person Bernie is, the important thing is that in time of trouble he helps others. The lesson is that there is a little good in all of us, even if they're a Bernie. He may think of himself alot, but does cares about his son. He is a loving dad, but not a good one. In the end, Bernie is still Bernie though we have learned to like him. The ending of this film is cute and only goes to show what he regretfully is.This has a good smart script that plays up and puts down the hero worship made by the media. Terrific acting from Hoffman who really makes Bernie LaPlante such a mega jerk but a human with some heart. Geena Davis and Andy Garcia are good in their roles, as are Joan Cusak(In & Out) as Bernie's ex and Kevin J O'Connor(Peggy Sue Got Married) as the living eye camera man.It may not look so good in the beginning, but give it time and learn a lesson about real life.

I used to be one of those people that watch movies to see violence and action and cool scenes and all that crap. But I changed. The problem is, I changed not that long ago, and in that time, never had the time to see a Dustin Hoffman film. (The last one, I think, was the abysmal Sphere.) So I went into this film expecting a good actor, but sort of blindly groping because I can't rememeber Dustin Hoffman.Hoffman plays a two-bit named Bernie Laplante who steals stuff to get by. He's on probation, his wife left him, all in all, he's pretty miserable. One day, as he is getting to his son, to take him to the movies, a plane inexplicably crashes in front of him. He goes in to save a boy's fatehr and ends up saving Gale Gayley (Geena Davis) a news anchor. Laplante goes off without recieving any of the praise, but when a 1 million dollar reward is offered, an impostor hobo (Andy Garcia) which Hoffman met that night, steps in as the real saviour of Flight 104.Hero is a comedy at heart; Hoffman is very good and very funny, if somewhat,yes,miscast. But the movie awkwardly shifts between drama and comedy, and although both are very well implented, together they sort of have trouble clicking. However the performances are very good and Chevy Chase has an amusing cameo. There are many funny jokes aimed at the business of television. All in all, this movie is worthy of a cold, frozen afternoon. 7/10P.S Despite its PG-13 rating, Hero contains a lot of profanity.

They are good people through and through. Then there are some people that aren't going to lift a finger to help you or anybody else. It's human nature. There's so many types of people in the world and we all fit into some level of classifiable mold of sorts. I'm the kind of person that will help when help is clearly needed, but I won't go out of my way either.Bernie Laplante (Dustin Hoffman) is the opposite. He doesn't help out unless there's some deep motivation -- usually cash or credit. See Laplante is basically a low level everything. Crook, father, employee, person. He's divorced, never there for his son and works at a carpet factory that soon he won't work at anymore. Did I mention he's got legal troubles? He's looking at a stint in prison for selling stolen goods to boot. His son and him eat a meal at a restaurant and a joint trip to the washroom yields a lost wallet. The son asks the obvious. Shouldn't this be turned in? Bernie's answer is why turn it in when the manager will just end up pocketing the money. The son doesn't know any better, but we do. Next thing, he's fencing the stolen credit cards at his pub. That's Bernie Laplante in a nutshell.Later on his way to pick his son up from his ex-wife's to go see a movie his car breaks down on a bridge. Next thing you know a plane has crashed landed right in front of him. It's unbelievable. After some thought, he gets out of his car takes off his stolen pair of two hundred dollar shoes and gets dirty. The plane's exit door is jammed and he's able to force it open after a try. The people pile out in a clear panic stomping him right into the mud. He tries to get up, but he's just driven back in by the next panicked passenger jumping out of the plane. Next thing you know this kid's telling him of his father who's still on the plane (hint hint). Bernie resists, the kid's goes please and he grudgingly decides to help. Inside some passengers are caught, some unconscious. He pulls them all out. Basically ends up saving the lives of everyone on board including a popular television reporter Gale Gayley (Geena Davis). He does however steal her purse on board while dragging her out -- but that's another matter. With the fire department and police on scene, he goes about finding his shoes he took off before he got dirty in the muck. Drat! He can only find one! Those were $200 dollar shoes! Bernie laments.The whole crash thing quickly becomes big news when it's discovered the person who saved everybody is a mystery. Gale being the head strong award winning reporter that she is smells ratings galore. Soon their dubbing Bernie the Angel of Flight 104. Bernie knows nothing of this though. Then the News Station Gale works at offers a cool one million dollars for an exclusive interview with the Angel. Too bad Bernie's in lockup awaiting bail on another case of selling stolen credit cards. These being Gale Gayley's.Hero is a weird tale at that. It's trying to work on so many levels at once that it could be easy to get lost for the average viewer. We got Bernie and his personal problems; legal, family, and otherwise and then we've got these other plot lines. Gale and the rabid news business and the mysterious indignant ex-Vietnam veteran, John Bubber (Andy Garcia) who comes forward claiming he's the Angel Of Flight 104. The key nemesis of the movie is it doesn't always know where it's going and neither do the characters. Bernie's philosophy is to always keep a low profile and he repeatedly passes this on to everyone - especially his son. Bubber is obviously an impostor, but his reasons are a mixed blessing. Meanwhile Gale and the news cronies are hungry for the person that has captured America's heart and more importantly the ratings and money spinoffs. When Bubber surfaces, they don't prod or investigate. Gale in fact is taken up with Bubber, who is rather cute and in fairy tale like world an almost perfect hero. Easily shapable and very easy to sell to the home audience no work needed. Meanwhile Bernie has to find a way of making things right -- in more ways than one.Hero is a good movie that could have been better if it could have been tighter. The cast does their job and the direction and writing is generally on course, but it feels too long and a tad implausible that only at the end does anybody really figure out what's going on. What Hero shows beautifully is the best and worst of people. That and Chevy Chase has possibly put in one of his best performances in a unbilled role.

Then one day, out of the blue, on the way home for his son's birthday, a plane crashes, and he helped open the door and carried out many of the survivors, including reporter Gale Gayley (Geena Davis), but he was obviously drunk, not thinking straight, and stealing what he can. The camera guy was paying more attention to a fire fighter, but looking back at the footage, learning of 54 survivors pulled out, and Gale claiming there was an Angel of Flight 104 the news are going hysterical praising and wondering who this hero is. Then in the campaign they decide to reward the unknown hero $1,000,000. Before hearing about this reward, Bernie told his experience to homeless John Bubber (Andy Garcia), and mentions not wanting any recognition. So Bubber takes the opportunity to lie and gets his fame, by not only by referring back to Bernie's story, but getting close to Gale. Eventually, after an arrest and bail, Bernie gets the chance to sort the situation with Bubber, even when Gale thinks Bernie is scheming and holding something over him (because he stole her purse). The film ends Bernie settling with Bubber staying the hero, getting some of the money, and Gale finds out the truth (off the record) and keeps to this decision also.

A great cast, some interesting characters, a timely concept, but somehow they just weren't mixed together properly. The story is actually believable to some extent. That wasn't the problem. More than anything the most disappointing thing they did was make Hoffman's character such a grouch.Hero is the story of a shady and down-on-his-luck guy who happens to be in the right place at the right time to rescue an entire plane load of passengers after a crash. Trouble is, he leaves the scene before anyone can figure out who he is, and another down-on-his-luck guy (Andy Garcia) ends up taking the credit for the rescue. This credit includes a million dollar reward and all the admiration from the public. Meanwhile, Hoffman has been put away for fencing stolen credit cards. He cannot get out in time to prove to anyone that he in fact did the heroic deed. Any time he tries he is basically shouted down, and nobody would really believe such a shady guy like him would do such a thing, anyway. A subplot involves Hoffman trying to win the admiration of his son who lives with his mother and her new man. Garcia, in the whirlwind of public attention also wins over a newswoman who was also on the plane played by Geena Davis. The comedic aspects of the film get bogged down in too much sentimentality, and the message aspect of the film ends up brooding over things.Hero has it's good parts. Davis and Garcia are actually pretty good. Davis being the plucky reporter who has the most insight into Garcia's situation. Garcia is obviously no saint, but he takes the opportunity to try and help inspire other people to become heroes themselves. Chevey Chase, uncredited, is hilarious as a network news big shot. There are some very memorable scenes. The plane crash was obviously done on the cheap, as we don't even see it until it is already down, but the scene where Hoffman rescues the passengers is somewhat believable. Hoffman has some funny scenes, but he should have had more of them. And that is the main problem with this film. Hoffman is TOO unlikeable. I don't know how many times he says goddamm, but it's just too many. He has a funny scene in a court room where he suggests the judge double his bail since he thinks he's about to cash in on a big reward. This scene has the right tone for his character. Joan Cusak as his ex-wife is excruciatingly annoying. And there is a cameraman who takes his job way too seriously and is also annoying. In addition, it just isn't logical how Hoffman's character is unable to properly explain to anyone that he is in fact the hero and not Garcia.In sum, this film is watchable but should have been better. At least funnier. We as a society do in fact worship people who do not in any way deserve such admiration. There is no doubting that.

First off, it's a story that's an extraordinary combination of THE BOY WHO CRIED WOLF, CINDERELLA and CITY LIGHTS. No one would believe that Bernie the Plant's a hero; The missing shoe was worn by the wrong person; the man who gave sight to the blind (meaning all the regular suckers who wanted a hero) was not a rich and noble man but, like Chaplin in City Lights, just some bum.The City Lights reference is quite clear in the telephone conversation that Bernie has with his son and wife when he talks about going away on a business trip and offering support to his wife (for the benefit of his son and her) when he's really going to prison. The screenplay, by David Webb Peoples, is just about perfect. Dialogue that's the best in a movie since Preston Sturges - and that's REALLY SAYING SOMETHING. Peoples, whatever he's doing now, had an astounding year in 1992 when he had, produced, two of the best scripts ever written by anyone - HERO and UNFORGIVEN.

I actually almost picked this up a few times while I was after the Jet Li movie of the same name. I am certainly glad I watched this. This is one of the most underrated comedies of the decade. After all, this is a satire. It reminded me of Wag the Dog which is also a satire starring Dustin Hoffman that was released a few years afar this. One thing Hero does better is sell its believability and accuracy.Dustin Hoffman's role of lowlife Bernard LaPlante reminds me of many people I grew up with-- all the way down to his core. He is a mean, dumb, hated loser who just wants money and spending time with his kid. One rainy night, his car breaks down and he witnesses a plane crash yards away from him. He pops the door open and reluctantly saves everybody just before the plane explodes (the plane had 54 passengers). It is funny the way he does it because since he doesn't want to save anybody. He did the right thing, but was it really in his nature? He loses one of his hundred dollar shoes in the event and gives the other to a bum (Andy Garcia) the next day. Bernie wants to keep a low-profile and not attract much attention because of all his felonies and criminal ties.Geena Davis plays a reporter who is always in search of a good story and happens to be on the plane. Nobody gets a good looks at Hoffman, so a search for a lowlife with the other shoe begins. Bernie is in jail due to stolen goods and Garcia claims to be the hero as he is a lowlife who has the shoe. The movie is nice and fun up until this point, but Garcia stepping up to the plate is where it really starts to sizzle. Garcia is awarded one million dollars and becomes a nationwide sensation, renowned hero and inspiration to millions. Garcia is humble and uses the money for good, but Hoffman--who is the actually hero of the crash--would have kept it all for himself. So the viewer must decide who is more worthy. The publicity the Davis starts is exactly how the media works and people are manipulated. That is how it is similar to Wag the Dog. The first component that makes this movie great is Dustin Hoffman. He is one of the best actors in film history and his role as a complete loser is both funny and heartrending. That is hard to do. He is also the protagonist and changes the least out of the three leads. In every movie there is chemistry, and Hoffman slightly changes but still stays to to your average thug from the ghetto. It is rare that a character stays the same throughout a movie but is still great. I did touch base on how the media is affective, but the big picture and moral is what makes a hero. Bernie LaPlante is a hero because he saved people from a plane crash. Andy Garcia is a hero because he is a selfless inspiration. This feel-good dramedy is one of the most underrated movies of the decade. I highly recommend it.

Hoffman is one of our greatest actors. He's a joy to watch. This isn't his best work or his best movie but it's still worthwhile and holds your attention.I can't say that I think Andy Garcia was a good pick for John Bubber. He's literally unbelievable as a homeless guy-cum-hero. After they clean him up, he seems all too comfortable in the five star restaurant and signing autographs. That's miscast #1.The other notable odd casting is Chevy Chase. Even though he is uncredited, he seems like is playing a role in Fletch (which is one of his few good movies).Geena Davis is good as the reporter that realizes that Bubber is a fake and Hoffman's LaPlante is the real hero.That said, watching Hero is a great way to spend a couple of hours. It bogs down in a couple of scenes but it's still fun to watch.

Surprisingly, upon going through the IMDb list of 1992 films, I found over 40 great movies, but only about 10 I had previously reviewed. I couldn't believe how many GREAT movies to masterpieces were released during that year. And though I had stories for many of them as I recall where I saw them, with whom and how the films affected me, this one really stood out.I remember seeing this opening weekend, that first weekend of October 1992 and absolutely gushing over it. Insta 10/10 stars. I praised it to everyone and practically begged people to see it. But&#x85;that's where my memory of this movie ends. I don't ever remember seeing it again during the 23 years between then and now. Funny. Usually when I loved a movie this much, I would've seen it on repeat back then, or at very least, *gulp* add it to my vast VHS collection.So, I had to see it again, and hopefully relive that joy I remember back in early October 1992. Did it live up to my own hype? Did it hold up after over two decades? Eh, not really. But, still, it was a very good movie.I did find myself laughing out loud &#x96; it was a straight up comedy, though feel-good comedy. And as bad as the three main characters were &#x96; man, our title character was such a horrible citizen, their turns at having a conscious were inspirational. Lifetime criminal Bernie is trying to balance being a good divorced dad to his son, hocking stolen goods and credit cards and attempting to stay out of prison when all of a sudden&#x85;a plane nearly drops on top of him. To put it very mildly, he reluctantly helps the people escape the tragic crash and even some trapped survivors. One of which, is Reporter Gale who makes it her mission to find the unknown hero who vanishes. A one-million-dollar reward draws out Bernie's bum friend to fake being the hero the Windy City needs.Those three, Bernie, Gale and the bum, John, all really turn the light- hearted comedy into something much better. All three have baggage and are technically bad people, but through the well-written script, signs of light shine through and it's a joy to see their bits of selflessness.Again, I didn't go all 10 stars with even more stars in my eyes this time around, but it's worth it to see it&#x85;even if just to see how many other stars showed up in minor roles. Maybe we all have a little bit of heroism in us, I'd like to take from this and hopefully believe in real life. ***Final thoughts In truth, I don't recall the actual flight number from the movie, but I used that number for the special reason I chose this film. It's been my lucky number most of my life 1516. And this is my 1,516th review. So, I had to make it special and count.Back in my day&#x85;ah-hem&#x85;not too long before the interwebs, we had in college THE ELECTRONIC FORUM, or ef for short. This is where college students could electronically talk with each other and their teachers on the old, plain green screens. It was basic, of course, but came with many, many different forums from the serious to the fun to even the meet-your-match ones. When I signed up, that fall of 1992, right around the time this movie opened, I was the 1,516th user (it eventually went up to the 10s of thousands) and hence, that was my destination ef1516.I've adopted that number for my life since &#x96; though, no, I don't use it as any of my PINs or passwords as that would be too easy for anyone who really knew me or my past. THAT was a long story on how I came to pick Hero as my 1,516th movie review. It was just perfect that I remember loving this movie at about the same time I claimed my lifelong lucky number.

Otherwise, most reviewers saw it as an inspiring story, or as a comedy/tragedy, or just as an entertaining film. It surely has some of all of these things in it. But with those aspects alone, Hero is only a fair movie. It's the satire that lifts the film and gives it some life and interest above just fun viewing. The satire is considerable &#x96; very subtle in places and not so in others. It's social commentary on the public adulation of heroes. It's the stereotyping of people who might be able to be heroes. But, mostly, it's about the TV news media and its piranha-esque drive for sensationalist news. And the film has some other aspects that are treated lightly, as if to be OK. Stealing, lying and deceit top the list. These aspects are interwoven with a hero who says selfless things and who acts in kind ways. So, he's inspiring. But the morality is a mixed bag with the dishonesty of the situation. That's part of the story and part of the satire. It's also the part that can be confusing for young people. They may ask, Do we applaud dishonesty or not? Or, Does the end justify the means?I can't agree with those who see characters miscast. I think the cast were all excellent in their performances. Dustin Hoffman is spot-on as Bernie. Gena Davis is very good as the once-sure and later conflicted news reporter, Gale. A couple people thought Any Garcia was miscast as the homeless, down and out person who turns around as the hero. But did they see that much turn around? I spent several years in soup kitchens and charity work for homeless folks an got to know a number of them. Garcia's John Bubber is an ideal character &#x96; much like half a dozen young men I met over the years. They each had a different story of a past that led them to their current state. I think Chevy Chase gave the best supporting performance as Deke. He played the hard-nosed, cynical, amoral, sensation-seeking, driven, uncaring and impersonal station news director perfectly. Are all such people that way? Probably not. But this was a good satire of the industry that competes that way. Kevin O'Connor was very good as the self-impressed TV cameraman, Chucky; and Stephen Tobolowsky was good as Wallace, the apparent station manager. The screenplay and plot were not spectacular. The rest of the technical aspects were OK to good. A big distraction to me was the excessive use of profanity by Hoffman's Bernie. It wasn't necessary for the character or story, and was enough of a distraction to lower the film's overall rating by a notch. And that's reason also to keep older children from watching the film &#x96; or for advising the more mature teens on the subject. Besides the satire, I think the smattering of witty lines or very funny comments make the film most enjoyable. Someone said (perhaps it was in a movie that I watched years ago) that there's a little bit of larceny in everyone. In this film, Garcia's character says something like that and adds that there's a little bit of hero in everyone. This film makes both points clearly. But it leaves the matter of truth and honesty up in the air. Here are some clever scenes and lines. In his hotel room, the new hero has all sorts of gifts from prominent people. He opens the card on a large fruit basket that reads, To John Bubber from Barbra Streisand. A good pun of the celebrity industry showing its support for the hero &#x96; otherwise to get in the act. The bartender says to Bernie, Don't be depressed, Bernie. You don't have to be a hero to be a human being. The news director, Deke, watches John Bubber on camera make remarks about decency and helping the needy, and turns to Wallace, Have you ever heard more BS or drivel coming from someone who isn't even president? Bernie, to his son, The thing about TV is, you don't want to believe what you see. Not always. Not if you're smart.

Watch this flick and then compare it with `The Contender' and you'll know what I'm talking about. It's enjoyable. If it drags at times, you get sufficiently compensated by watching charming performances by Hoffman, Davis, Andy Garcia and others.

On the top it doesn't seem to be that much, but when one begins to look deeper one sees that this movie is very scathing of the media and the way they turn people into celebrities, even though they did nothing to deserve it. The major theme of this movie is that of appearance and reality - what is real, and if television says it does that mean that it is true? And are those heroes we see on television really heroes or are they just foolish people who were damn lucky? Bernie Le-Plant (Dustin Hoffman) is the typical everyday cretin. He has just been convicted of receiving stolen goods and he is to be sentenced in six days. During the trial he steals a heap of money off of his lawyer, who is only a court-appointed lawyer that he does not like, and then goes off to make himself look good in the eyes of society by seeing his son. While going to get his son, a plane crashes in front of him, and because he cannot drive over the bridge as there is a burning plane in the way, he rather reluctantly goes and opens the door, after removing his $100 shoes. After letting the people out, a kid asks him to find his dad, so rather reluctantly Bernie goes into the plane and saves those trapped in there, but there is no Fletcher, as he has already escaped. While rescuing a journalist, he decides to steal her purse. The twist evolves when he loses one shoe and gives the other to a vagrant, John Bubba (Andy Garcia), who lives out of a truck. Bubba is a nice and honest guy, but when the television station offers a million dollars to the person who rescued the people from the plane, Bubba cannot resist and takes the shoe and claims the prize. Unlike Cinderella, Bubba is not the real princess, yet he turns out to be the most deserving one. Now that they have their hero, the media sets about turning him into a god. Everybody loves him and literally hangs of every word he says. Everybody by the real hero, Bernie Le-Plant. The thing is that Le-Plant is not the hero type - Bubba visits hospitals and give people hope, while Le-Plant just simply wanders around stealing credit-cards and landing up in jail. Though Bubba is not the real hero, he conforms to the people's idea of a hero and thus finds himself trapped in the role. He tries to get out by trying to speak the truth but nobody really wants to listen to him - he is the hero and nothing is going to change their minds about it. The most interesting aspect of the movie occurs at the climax where Bubba is standing on the ledge of a building wanting to jump off. He is fed up with living a lie and Le-Plant is haunting his dreams. He knows Le-Plant is the real hero and the guilt of his lie is tearing him apart. Le-Plant gets out onto the ledge to save Bubba, and they begin to talk, but as they talk, the media slowly begin to twist things around - what began as Bubba wanting to jump and Le-Plant talking him down, becomes Le-Plant wanting to jump and Bubba saving him. Bubba is the hero figure and the media want to milk it for as much as they can. By the time they are back into the building, everybody has forgotten that it was actually Bubba out on the ledge originally wanting to jump. The movie shows us a very cold and indifferent side of the media. The quote about suicidees is not trying to talk them down - that does not make a good news story - but not catching them least they pull you over as well. The journalist comes slowly to see this side of the media as the person whom she has come close to - Bubba - is now the target of the media's sensationalism. Her cameraman still does not understand, and simply wants to see somebody making a red mark on the ground. As the news stations buzz with activity at the action occurring on the skyscraper - the talk is not about bringing them down, but digging up information regarding the people on the ledge. When another station discovers who Bernie Le-Plant is and slowly manipulates the story around to suit them, the executive has a fit as they did not get the information first. As what was said in Wag the Dog, a movie with a similar theme, if it is said on television then it must be true - one cannot contradict a story that has been developed by another station, unless the contradiction reveals even more sensational evidence.

Something about the movie is rather good. I also find it very annoying in a sense as well. Runs the table between being good and not so good all at the same time. A guy who is a bit of a small time crook and con man is really having a tough go of it. He ends up at the scene of a plane crash and ends up helping a large number of the passengers off the plane before it explodes. He does not want to be recognized for this partly due to the fact that the little boy who asked him to help his daddy. The guy rescues all these people, but did not stumble across the kid's dad thus he thinks that the father did not survive. Basically this guy seems like a bad person, but in reality he does have a soft spot. Well another man ends up taking credit for this rescue, a man that got a hold of something that linked the guy who did the rescue to said event. He basically gave the real hero a drive and the guy gave him a shoe as he lost the other at the crash. The film has good stars as Dustin Hoffman plays the person who did the rescuing and Gena Davis is the one that launches the search for him when he does not immediately step forward. Andy Garcia plays the one who takes the credit. There are funny moments, but I did not care for parts of the ending mainly the ledge scene and how it got turned around on who was helping who.

It is disappointing to see a man who performed admirably in such great pictures as The Graduate, Papillon and Rainman stoop so low as to accept a part in this second rate script.There are lots of parts that I found un-enjoyable, including Davis' harangues and Hoffman's more than lame character, but it does have one or two saving graces. I like the many scenes with Hoffman that are not related to him being a hero, including steeling money from his lawyer, claiming that the homeless play the stock exchange, advising his son to keep a low profile and his many other moral philosophies on life. It is probably worth watching for these bits alone, in much the same way as it was worth watching Conspiracy Theory not for the main story, but for hearing Gibson's theories and seeing his lifestyle.The main theme of the film does, however, get very old very fast. We know from the beginning that he wont get credit for his endeavour, but we find out that the guy who did is a far better bloke, so it is hard to feel sorry for Hoffman. It portrays the American public as being a stupid bunch of easily persuaded unimaginative sheep when it comes to role models, so I suppose that there is a message in it. Aside from the dialogue that he gets, we can see that Hoffman struggles to keep the film going, and the hollow script is barely enough to sustain the near 2-hour running time.The Chevy Chase cameo, and seeing that guy Bing from Groundhog Day were mildly amusing, but really this film was of an largely banal nature.

Yet it ends like a Capra movie, which, by the 90's standards, isn't so good.TV replaced newspapers as domineering media. Journalists are modern vultures in quest for sensational stories. Geena Davis is one of them, Gale, the wisecracking Jean Arthur-figure, fantasizing about THE scoop while crossing her legs on her boss' desk. And Andy Garcia is John Bubber, Gary Cooper's John Doe, the bum toyed by the media to become an instant hero, for a public hungry for models.Hero asks insightful questions about our need of heroic figures as scapegoats to vent our social anger on. The most thought-provoking question it asks is to which extent we're ready to accept a phony yet pleasing reality rather than a non photogenic truth. And the cynical aspect of the film is embodied by the main character Dustin Hoffman as Bernie LaPlante, perhaps the only person in the film who doesn't inspire a déjà-vu feeling from a Capra film, although he looks like an older version of Ratso Rizzo, the depth lacking.LaPlante is a small time crook specialized in pick-pocket and gold cards selling. To say that he's a loser is an understatement he's divorced, her wife married with a fireman, his son loves him but hasn't got much to admire. To accentuate the pathos, LaPlante steals the purse of his lawyer during the trial that makes his jail sentence imminent and having his free days numbered doesn't make him remorseful at all. Not only he gives his son the kind of advice to show that a Father-of-the-Year, he ain't, he also keeps his stealing habits. We get it, LaPlante is unredeemable.Is he? Maybe the portrayal of LaPlante flirts with one-dimensionality to better prepare us for the film's pivotal moment when he saves, all alone, 54 passengers from a crashing plane by just opening the emergency door. A panicked boy begs him to find his father, LaPlante's son reflecting in these sad-looking eyes decides him for once, to accomplish one unselfish deed. He saves many passengers trapped in the plane, including Gale whom, conditioned by his job, he steals the purse. The trick is that he never finds the father (who safely left the plane) and out of guilt, chooses to fade in anonymity again, while, Gale, on stretchers, also conditioned by her job, is already trying to find the hero.The rest of the film is pure Capra material, the TV channel tries to find the mysterious man, and the only hint left is the shoe Bernie left before getting on the mud. The mysterious Cinderella man or 'Angel of the Flight 104' becomes the most wanted man of America. Bernie tells the story to the lucky John Bubber who drove him home on his van (which is also his house) leaves his shoe so he can give it to a crippled friend, and naturally, when one million dollars are offered, Bubber has his moment of weakness. Everyone is convinced, starting by Gale, a sweet, good-looking and sincere Vietnam vet, the perfect antithesis to men like LaPlante.Except that he's not the hero, and that's the cynical core of Stephen Frears' comedy, when truth matters less than the way media depicts it, when phony figures bring more hope and goodness than real ones, especially in the crisis-stricken America of the early 90's. Bubber is perfect beyond words, becoming a sort of modern prophet, awakening a comatose kid with the right words. At that point, the film is so full of irony that we stop waiting for LaPlante to raise his voice, we wonder if it really matters, since Bubber really helps people. Of course, the story can't do without the recognition of LaPlante's merits.And this is where the main weakness lies. No one ever listens to LaPlante, not after the disaster, no after he learned about the reward. Take the scene where he gets back home all mud-covered with one shoe left, his wife doesn't even try to know what happened, she angrily blames him for disappointing his son, who wanted to go &#x85; to the movies! I was like oh no!, he'd just seen his son! they could've come with better than that. What if she didn't believe him, while the son does? How come LaPlante never tells anyone or tries to confront Bubber, through another channel? The same pattern works in reverse when Bubber tries to tell the truth to Gale, she doesn't let him speak. You know something is wrong when the simplest situation in the world doesn't happen for the sake of a script. The result is that most of the film consists on LaPlante getting more and more pitiful, Bubber more and more heroic, and in-between, Gales doesn't have suspicion only until the last minute. The result is a good satire about the social role of media but an average comedy that never challenges its own potential and keeps on repeating the same situations.It's just as if Frears were so hurried to get to the scene when the name of LaPlante would be mentioned on the same breathe than Bubber and everyone reacts to it, that he took the 'easy way' to get to it. Dustin Hoffman specialized in various roles where he pointed out the role media frenzy can play on a social level, from All the President's Men to Mad City, Wag the Dog or Tootsie, in the best ones, things always go totally out of proportions and even media can't control them. In Hero, everything stays in-control and kind of kills off the whole cynical aspect of the premise.It's just as Frears trusted us to believe in the characters' actions', while if there's one thing to learn from his own film, is to never take firm beliefs for granted.

I cannot affirm that this is merely the translation of an exaggerated sense of morbidity among Spanish people &#150; `morbo' TV programmes keep a high level of screen share here at peak viewing times. I think you can easily understand that a film with an aeroplane crashing on top of New York is not exactly a good idea given the circumstances at the moment. The truth is, I only selected this film because Dustin Hoffman is in it, without discounting the added interest that Andy García could give us. As for the `unknown' Daniel Baldwin lower down in the cast, I prefer not to comment. Dustin Hoffman has impressed me in his better roles, such as in `Midnight Cowboy', `The Graduate', `Straw Dogs', `Papillon', `Kramer versus Kramer', `American Buffalo' (qv), and `Rain Man', and have shown me he is not one of those stereotyped actors, but able to carry out more or less successfully many kinds of roles. Curiously it is precisely in `Hero' that I first felt tempted to thinking that he is more or less continuing on from where he left off back in 1969 as Ratso Rizzo. However, as the film progressed, it became more apparent that the film is a skit or parody the hidden humour makes itself evident, making it pleasing that people are able to see, appreciate and laugh at their own foibles. In this case the unreasoning passion for creating idols &#150; whether real or imaginary is not at all important &#150; and how camera-toting and microphone-wielding reporters from newspapers, TV and radio cluster around the great news-making hero of the moment.  Certainly this film should not be classified merely as a comedy, nor even drama, as the ingredients involved in the situation presented is a kind of lightweight parody; the real hero is no such thing as he totally ignores that everyone wants to find him, and anyway, he is a loser in the fight for life who would rather sell his own mother than put himself into any kind of compromising situation. I give it 5½ out of ten, if only because Hoffman and García carry out roles which occasioned a few stomache-laughs. Geena Davis did not come up to much, and it is not the first time.

However the biggest joke is, he's such an ill-mannered, disreputable lout, he doesn't deserve any recognition! Geena Davis has some brief moments where her innate charm comes through without effort, and the supporting cast is full of wonderful characters actors; however, no one here merits much interest. You know a picture's in trouble when there are only two decent people on hand a non-mouthy teenager and Tom Arnold as a bartender. *1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"Failed attempt at satire.","Date":"25 July 2003","Score":"2 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  ** out of ****This movie has its good moments and its bad moments, unfortunately there are more bad moments than there are good. The fist half is pretty funny. It is not especially well written, but it is enjoyable and the actors are fun to watch. Especially Dustin Hoffman. In the second half though, the actors become overly annoying and the filmmakers get weird on us. Social commentary is thrown into the mix, but whatever statement or comment they are trying to make is unknown to me, and perhaps to them, too. Overall, it's a movie weighed down by weak writing, mixed messages, and inconsistent characters. "}]
