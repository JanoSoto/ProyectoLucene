[{"Title":"A Character Study That Goes Beyond","Date":"9 November 2002","Score":"95 out of 106 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":"  The inability to `reconnect' in the wake of a significant emotional event, especially one involving a close encounter with death, is examined by director Peter Weir, in `Fearless,' a gripping drama starring Jeff Bridges as a man emotionally adrift after walking away from an accident (a plane crash) that by all rights should have killed him, but inexplicably did not.  And Weir goes on to take what is essentially a character study one step further, beyond the inevitable `why me?' that one who survives such an unimaginable episode in their life must necessarily make, to probe the psyche of the survivor and attempt to sort out the ensuing catch-22 of the mind, wherein the incident has manifested a schizophrenic sense of guilt/euphoria born of fate's decree that he, among those now dead, should live.  It's a lot to assimilate; a taxing physical and psychological challenge necessitating an expanded utilization of the human capacity, and the subsequent negotiation of the attendant recast attitude and aptitude.  All of which Weir succinctly captures through keen observation and his own intuitive grasp of the human condition.As the film opens, we see Max Klein (Bridges) making his way through a cornfield just outside of Bakersfield, California; he's carrying a baby in his arms and has a young boy by the hand, leading him determinedly through the haze of smoke from the crash.  There are others following Max, as well.  And even before they emerge from the field, coming upon the crash site where rescue workers are already furiously attempting to sort it all out, there is a detachment about Max that is readily discernible.  He surveys the situation calmly, as if seeing it all through the eyes of someone else, as if he were outside of himself, observing rather than experiencing.  Then after locating the baby's mother, he simply walks away from it all, never looking back.Two days later the F.B.I. finds him in a local motel.  They put him together with a representative from the airline, who offers him a train ticket back home to San Francisco.  But Max wants to fly home, which astounds the rep.  `But your wife,' she says, `Told us that you didn't like to fly, even before the--'  `The crash?' he replies.  Then with assurance he tells her, `I want to fly home on your airline.  But I have a request; I want to go first class.'  And we know now, without question, that Max is not the same man that he was before the crash. In his previous films, such as `Picnic At Hanging Rock' (1975), `Witness' (1985) and `The Mosquito Coast' (1986), Weir established himself as a director who knows human nature and is adept at exploring the emotional depths of his characters, in stories dealing with ordinary people thrust into extraordinary situations.  As he does with this film, Weir sets a deliberate pace and allows that extra moment that means so much to the development of the characters.  It's a subtle approach that adds depth and resonance to his films, and allows his audience to experience, rather than just watch, the drama as it unfolds.  And he understands (as few directors do-- especially Americans ) the impact that `silence' can have, as in the scenes here shortly after Max leaves the crash sight.  First, Weir shows us a solemn Max, driving alone through the desert at high speed, gradually awakening to the joys of living, to that `feeling' of being alive, as he sticks his head out of the widow and lets the wind hit him in the face, slapping him with the reality that he is, indeed, alive.  But then we see Max parked by the side of the road, sitting on the ground, pensively staring out at the vast expanse of desert and at the low, blue mountains in the distance.  The absolute silence Weir effects allows us to share Max's thoughts at that moment, to get inside his head as he picks up a bit of dirt and examines it closely, then as he looks up again at the nothingness/everything that surrounds him.  As Max reflects, we reflect with him; and in that precise moment, that necessary connection between Max and the audience is firmly established.  It's a quiet, and brilliant, piece of filmmaking.Through many years and many movies, Jeff Bridges has demonstrated time and again his consummate ability as an actor who can `touch' his audience, and he continues to evolve with every new film.  Max is perhaps his most challenging role ever, as it requires a vast emotional range to make this character convincing and bring him to life believably.  And Bridges succeeds magnificently, and on a number of levels, with an inspiring, Oscar worthy performance.  The finesse with which he conveys his moods and emotions is extraordinary; he enables you to `feel' his displacement, share his compassion, sense his empathy and know his anger.  Quite simply, Bridges makes Max Klein a character you are not going to forget.As Laura Klein, Isabella Rossellini gives a remarkable performance, as well, as the wife given the gift of her husband's life, only to have to suffer his state of `limbo,' as she desperately attempts to penetrate the defense mechanisms that have given him a renewed appreciation for the touch, taste and beauty of life, all of which she is unable to share because his experience has taken him to a place she cannot possibly go.  Her portrayal is astute, convincing and some of the best work she has ever done.Also turning in a strong performance, for which she deservedly was nominated for Best Supporting Actress, is Rosie Perez, as Carla, a fellow crash survivor with whom Max forms an especially strong and significant bond.Written for the screen by Rafael Yglesias (adapted from his own novel), beautifully filmed by Allen Davian, and with a haunting score by Maurice Jarre that so sensitively enhances the drama in an understated way, `Fearless' is an example of filmmaking at it's best.                   "},{"Title":"jeff bridges at his best","Date":"21 July 2004","Score":"83 out of 90 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":"  Jeff Bridges has been called the most underrated actor of his generation, and 'Fearless' speaks to the truth of such a claim. Equally overlooked is Australian director Peter Weir, who, like Bridges, was snubbed by the Academy Awards for 'Fearless.' The film was almost totally ignored by the Academy, perhaps due to the fact that 1994 was the year of the historical/political epic--'Schindler's List,' 'In the Name of the Father,' and 'The Remains of the Day' were the big winners that year, casting a bit of a shadow over a film about a rich white American suffering from PTSD.Based on the novel by Rafael Yglesias, 'Fearless' is the story of Max Klein, a successful San Francisco architect who survives a horrific plane crash. Among the casualties of the crash are Klein's partner and best friend and the only child of Carla (Rosie Perez), a young Puerto Rican woman from Oakland who blames herself for her son's death. Prior to the accident Max suffered from an acute fear of flying; when the plane goes down, his fear becomes so intense that he accepts death. When he survives the crash, he suffers from a form of post-traumatic stress syndrome in which he can no longer feel fear because subconsciously he has already faced death. His condition creates a rift between himself and his family, a gap he tries to fill through a friendship with Carla, who is similarly afflicted with PTSD.Bridges gives a tour de force performance as Max, who is simultaneously heroic (he leads other passengers to safety believing he is guiding them out of the plane into heaven) and contemptible (he is unspeakably cruel to his family and leaves his wife temporarily to pursue a relationship with Carla).He's not sure whether he's alive or dead, and he is frequently drawn to test his fear and uncertainty through ludicrously dangerous stunts like dancing on the edge of a skyscraper's roof or walking calmly into speeding traffic. It's an unflinching and emotionally honest portrayal of a psychologically damaged man unsure that he has the strength or will to be healed. Equally stunning is Rosie Perez as Carla, a devout Catholic who believes that her baby's death is a punishment from God and is nursed back to normalcy by the agnostic Max. Other supporting actors are also captivating Isabella Rosselini as Max's wife Laura, who loves her husband desperately but is unable to cope with Max's alienation from her and their son Jonah; Tom Hulce as an overeager but well-meaning attorney suing the airline on behalf of Max, his partner's family, and Carla; John Turturro as a psychiatrist specializing in PTSD hired by the airline to help the survivors cope with the after-effects of the tragedy; and Benicio Del Toro as Carla's husband, a poor carpenter who can't help but feel giddy about the possibility of making millions off of his son's death. Perhaps most moving is Deirdre O'Connell as the widow of Max's partner--the scene in which Max arrives at her home to confirm that her husband did not survive the crash will break the hardest of hearts.The film is brilliantly directed by Weir, who captures the surreal nature of Max's condition masterfully.'Fearless' is not an easy film to get through, perhaps even moreso in the wake of 9/11. The subject matter is emotionally wrenching, and its presentation is utterly unsentimental. Max is heroic, but he is also a victim, and Bridges' performance captures the tension between Max's newfound love of life and his near-psychotic need to continually face and overcome his fears. It's a tear-jerker, and it's certainly haunted by the ghosts of the dead, but it's well-worth watching if only for the pleasure of seeing one of the best actors in the business at his best.

I just want to reiterate, first, how incredible the cast is.  Working in a plot that demands attention to and awareness of subtleties, *every* actor, on down to the smallest part, puts forth flawless performances, and are directed brilliantly.  If I was John Turturro, I'd have calmed it down a little, but if he did that, he wouldn't be John Turturro. )Isabella Rossellini is given the strongest role of her career (I mean, in *Blue Velvet*, she was scorching and daring, but she was played as a bit of an archetype and dream figure, and not as a woman struggling through a life crisis in quite so identifiable a way).  Rather than fall prey to playing her role as an insensitive wife who doesn't understand the extraordinary passage her husband is undergoing, she is given the chance to really be a hero in her own right.  She could *never* understand--but she tries to--and gives extraordinary credibility in a role of struggling to give what she can as Jeff Bridges' Max Klein hurtles himself into his obsessive self-made universe from his ordeal and survival.  When it's clear she can no longer do that, she becomes a noble warrior to fight for her own sanity and that of her son.  The procession of her character is flawless and every moment feels right.The interplay between Rossellini and Rosie Perez is played out with unexpected honesty, restraint and brilliance.  Perez' Carla has her own parallel situation, with a husband who completely can't understand why she won't exploit the situation for all she can get in court (a great early small performance from Benecio Del Torro).  He is, like Rossellini, troubled by the bizarre and nonobvious intimacy that has developed between his wife and Jeff Bridges, two people whose lives might never have ordinarily crossed.  Perez is, as has been mentioned elsewhere here, devastating. Her grief over the loss of her son is sustained and utterly utterly credible.This brings us to Jeff Bridges.  Man, oh man, this is his career masterpiece performance--arguably the greatest leading acting role of the 1990's.  He *gets* what writer Rafael Yglesias and Peter Weir are narrowly aiming for here, and it's something no other movie has approached that I've seen. It is--the instantaneous and seemingly lifelong bond that develops between those who have been through a life-changing crisis, and how that can completely absorb them to the exclusion of *everything* else in their lives. What sounds like a subtle point here is **nailed** by Yglesias and Weir, and I can't imagine another actor who could have gotten what that feels like.  I know from personal experience--mine was nothing like a plane crash--but the phenomenon that this movie ventures to explore that I just described, which may seem like mostly bizarre behavior shifts in Bridges' character to those who haven't experienced what I'm talking about--is in fact as real as love, fear, or passion itself.  What Bridges realizes in putting together Max Klein is that he's *utterly* lucid--he feels as though he sees things as clearly as he ever has in his life and *never* wants to let that clarity go to revert to a more rational way to confront the trauma he has gone through.Others have mentioned the why didn't this get bigger press issue.  The studio was quite nervous that this was an art house movie and didn't promote it as heavily as they might have.  It actually did quite well at the box office initially and early advocacy for Bridges and Weir to get Oscars were definitely out in the review stream, but this had the misfortune of being released *just* before a little movie called *Schindler's List*, which summarily grabbed the cinematic spotlight and completely eclipsed everything else at the Oscars.Director Peter Weir himself considers this his greatest work and was greatly stung by what he considered the slight it was given by Hollywood and the public.  In many ways it has shaped a cynicism towards Hollywood he has had ever since, and it would be five years before he'd find it in himself to direct another film.

It's the story about how survivors of a plane crash cope with life afterwards, their neuroses, fears and personal demons. It is a quiet film, so quiet that one can barely hear the inner tremblings of the main character.He is a survivor without fear. He has summoned up a supernatural lack of fear towards life and psychological health now that he has survived a plane accident. In times of crisis, he has the ability to block fear and to live on adrenalin alone. He has become in the eyes of the other plane passengers, a hero and an inspiration.But even though this lack of fear is his saving grace, it is also threatening to jeopardize his life. He copes with the nightmares and emotional traumas with  the same reaction that helped him along on that fateful day. But in real life, this way to cope is unhealthy and even dangerous. One must live afraid to be a normal person. One must worry about finances and loss of love.The film is imperfect, as any great film should be. There are slow moments and perhaps a little too much pop psychology. (But the film is as subtle as it gets). There are marvelous character touches, such as a lawyer trying to file a lawsuit who keeps apologizing for his greediness. (The film exposes the genuine dilemmas of trying to compensate victims and their families).Perhaps the most amazing scene is a reenactment of the plane crash itself. I won't give anything away about the story, but the scene is hauntingly beautiful; it shows the overwhelming force of the wind and the earth ripping apart the fusilade and all the parts of the luggage and cabin that humans normally deal with. It is a violent, horrifying scene and a horrifying memory, but for the main character, he can imagine it with the appropriate distance and  without the pain. This accident was the defining moment for his life, and after that scene, we realize how amazing it is that he and the rest of them could have survived, and how fragile their life was in the face of overwhelming force.This story imagines a disaster and how useless it is to be afraid of a force more powerful than any individual (and that is the main character's profound insight).

It was in it's second week in theaters. After the credits rolled, I heard a lot of weeping from the small but vocal audience.Maybe the film flopped because some people expected a 1970's-style disaster flick with cardboard characters, laughable dialog and unknown extras & doubles performing dangerous stunts.It's been almost eight years since watching Fearless for the first time. This is one of only 5 movies I actually own in my very small tape library.Director Peter Weir amazes me. With a few exceptions (I didn't like Dead Poets Society and I haven't seen Green Card), he has always walked on a tightrope when it comes to telling a story. It might not result in a satisfying ending but when you think about what was presented two hours earlier, it makes a lot of sense. It's a logical and very fascinating progression.I believe that Jeff Bridges can (almost) do no wrong. His character may not be very likable but put yourself in his character's shoes and you may understand the reasons why he believes that he is fearless.I haven't seen Isabella Rossellini's performance in Blue Velvet but it makes me wonder if her performance in that film beats her role as the caring but very confused wife of Jeff Bridges' character. She's definitely the heart of Fearless. I cared for her. I felt empathy; her confusion of what her husband was doing to himself, her family and herself. She's on the outside trying her best to understand what it was like to survive a plane crash. But at the same time, not totally understanding what it was like to be on the ill-fated flight. Rossellini gave a glowing performance.Rosie Perez's performance as the distraught woman who lost her young son in the crash was incredible. Unlike some people in this world, I do like Perez (thick Spanish accent and all). What really impressed me was how she captured the depth of losing her child. There have been some films & TV movies that have captured the effects of a family losing a spouse or adult child. There haven't been as many to deal with the loss of a child as well as Fearless did. Perez hasn't had a role with this much depth in a long time. I was pleasantly surprised when she received an Oscar nomination for Supporting Actress, the movie's only nomination.The unrequited bond between Bridges' and Perez's characters was fascinating to watch. They survived something that their love ones will never understand. In the end, the two need to understand that despite their losses, they are still alive in this world and somehow they need to find a way to get back to reality.Screenwriter Rafael Yglesias, who wrote the novel, captured the complexity of crash survivors almost flawlessly. One weak link John Turturro had the thankless job of playing the underwritten role of the psychiatrist.When a film like Fearless even inspires a music video (Brian McKnight's Back At One), then you know that this movie will have a lasting effect and with cable, VHS & DVD, it'll never be forgotten. I certainly haven't forgotten it.

Having a classical music background, I am always keyed into a film's use of music.  Fearless reminds me that the combination of music and film is an art form which has been sadly neglected in modern culture and trashed by MTV. This movie is high art.  The final sequence is emotionally and spiritually a transcending experience, illustrating the bittersweet reality of human existence.  An experience not available through words, music, or images on their own.  I cried like a baby. Movies tend to be built upon a setup and a payoff.  Tension and release are the common currency for most art.  I have never seen a better cinematic payoff than the one Fearless provides.  And that's because the setup is flawless.  There is endless brilliance here in the telling of the story. Don't miss the use of light.  Light flashing across Max's face when death is at the door; in the plane and the car scene with Carla.(If possible, Fearless might have been even more effective in black and white.)  The subtle transition to slow motion during the scene with Carla and the baby at the mall. Jeff Bridges is irresistible in this performance.  His character has been translated out of the realm of corporeal perspective.(As demonstrated through his allergy to strawberries.)  When he walks through the plane and assures the passengers that everything will be fine, I believed him.  His appearance is almost a religious experience.  But his serenity cannot last. He must be reborn into the frailties of human existence or he will be estranged from the world.  And that is the payoff.  The glorious payoff in which death in an airplane crash becomes a poetic vision of the human experience.  We live, we die, but we imbue the universe with a greater purpose even if there is no god to acknowledge it. I hope history will judge this movie to be a classic, unappreciated in it's time.  This is Peter Weir's masterpiece.  It's hard for me to believe that he could follow this effort with the extremely banal and uninspiring Truman Show  But I suppose even Mozart had off days.

But this film hit a sweet spot, perhaps soft spot, in my heart. It did when I saw it new, and again more powerfully when I saw it again last night.I suppose it is a simple truth that dramas -- even simple dramas -- can reach you if they target a domain of your life where you have experienced pain or confusion. This one targets the fear of actively combating the angst of emptiness that same emptiness, by the way, that is crystallized and defined for us in films -- 60s and 70's art films and their children.Max is an architect, movieland shorthand for a creative person working not just in the world of ideas but in the `real' world. His self is restored when his fear is -- more precisely he becomes a whole being again when his vulnerabilities are recognized. This all happens against a backdrop of movieland textures the lovely ballet dancer wife who makes her reality in performance; the obsequious psychiatrist who creates his reality in (obviously bogus) explanations; the greedy lawyer who eagerly creates a `colored' history of memories; the religious Hispanic woman whose memory can be altered; the visit to an old girlfriend who tells him that things are not as he remembers; the architect partner whose only building we see is a `virtual' reality.Created worlds, constructed remembrances can only be pulled off if a level of self-confidence is guaranteed. The dynamics of openness, pain and earnestness are what's referenced here. Bridges is not a great actor, but he is intelligent. He knows how to reflect the fabric that Weir is weaving in his internal drama. Did precisely the same for the Coens with `Lebowski' but there with comic overtones. No less visceral.What makes this work, the one episode that will stick with me forever is the `crash' at the end the destruction of our vehicle -- the ripping open of our container.

Fear is so much more difficult to overpower, or even sometimes be conscious of, than reason that when we do overpower fear, it is not necessarily replaced by reason, but by exhilarating mania. Jeff Bridges, in one of his best performances, covers a lot of ground in his character, a survivor of a plane crash. Many die, including his business partner. The catastrophe metamorphoses his whole life thereafter. He enters an enhanced perceptive condition, believing he is dead, beginning to rethink life, death, God and the afterlife.Bridges becomes addicted to walking a tightrope over death because it makes him feel as alive and enlightened as he possibly can. But this also dwindles his connection to his family and his life. He begins to have difficulty recognizing the limits of mortality, in some way perceiving himself as more than mere flesh and blood. Rosie Perez, however, in a performance equaling Bridges' in personal reconciliation with her role, plays another survivor, whose baby son she failed to protect from death by the crash. In her own aftermath, she is the unmistakable foil to Bridges' expansive superman complex as a mother who loses all will to live.The two find themselves bonding, sharing a connection that transcends the love we tend to understand, or that Isabella Rossellini, as Bridges' wife, and Benicio Del Toro, as Perez's husband, tend to understand. And as Bridges begins to reach the dangerous peak of his high on existence, Perez is forced to make amends with the world, taking control of shaping herself. The film is a boundless interpretation of an all-encompassingly utilitarian philosophy, a kind of precept that amalgamates the black and white duality of unflappable idealism and hopeless despair.There are peripheral nebbishy professionals played in bit parts by a gregarious Tom Hulce and John Turturro who has as a virtually futile psychologist-for-hire a sort of ironic missionary zeal. We hear Gorecki's beautiful major string orchestra sound. But the film would not have the same kind of clarity, or perhaps even the same themes, without the articulately detailed cinematic expression of Rafael Yglesias' material by the director, Peter Weir.

Some give you a positive momentary taste. Very few films give you spiritual nourishment that you can savor for years to come. Fearless (1993) is such a film. I hope someday there will be a DVD package worthy of such a courageous and moving experience. Assuming the brilliance of all involved, especially Peter Weir (director), Rafael Yglesisas (Writer), and all of the actors, this profound viewing experience changed how I look at life. One very perceptive friend described the plot as a journey from not dead to alive. Max Klein (Jeff Bridges) makes such a journey, but not alone, even if he thinks to the contrary. This is also one of the best depictions of marriage on screen. The scenes between Bridges and Isabella Rosselini really crackle with emotion and intensity. It's rare to see a marital conflict where you can sympathize and even empathize with both characters. That is a tribute to Isabella and the writing/directing. Also successful (though not as universal) is the strange relationship between Max and Carla (Rosie Perez). Nice atypical work from John Turturro, Benecio Del Toro, and Tom Hulce provides some much-needed humor.Also, this film avoids dwelling on the simple psychological clichés of PTSD and survivor guilt. Instead of talking about it, the viewer sees, feels and experiences it. This is a rare gem of film history and one of the most overlooked movies in history. Here's hoping that changes soon.

I feel like I'm inside, inhabiting the characters when I watch Fearless. The defining event the movie revolves around--a plane crash--seems inspired by an actual plane crash (I think it was in Sioux City) in which the plane rolled over in a corn field several times. Aside from the horrific manner in which it crashed, the accident was noteworthy because so many passengers survived, in some cases literally walking away.I read that Peter Weir got involved in this project by asking the studio to let him see any properties that they felt could not be made into a movie (this would seem to fit the bill). After seeing the movie I was moved to read the book, but I believe the film is better. No matter how many times I watch it, the result of this material in Peter Weir's hands never loses its power for me.The post-crash impact on Max's relationship with his wife&#151;and the formation of relationships with other survivors--is an important aspect of the movie The survivors bond through this shared experience, while their families feel shut out and don't (or won't) understand the power this connection has for their loved ones. This plot element is the only bit that seems off to me, as if it's both too much and too little to effectively advance the film (perhaps due to editing/time constraints?) Jeff Bridges is always worth watching, though his acting is so subtle and natural that I always forget I'm watching him, and that he's acting. But Rosie Perez's performance is a real standout; she should have won the Oscar she was nominated for. While I identified with her role as a mother of a small child (my own son was the same age as Bubbles when I first saw the film), her performance itself seemed fearless, as if she stripped her soul and emotions naked in this role. Fearless is unforgettable.

I suppose Schindlers' List was the on voters' minds that year(rightfully so, it too is a masterpiece), and Tom Hanks' fine performance in Philadelphia was most certainly appreciated by the actor community, to help the world understand what was happening right under their noses, we need to fight AIDS and stop denying the humanity of those who suffer from it. But I read an earlier comment on Fearless from someone who felt this movie portrayed loss, grief and fear better than any gay or AIDS-theme movie ever. This blows me away, because Tom Hanks received an Oscar for playing a gay man dying of AIDS, yet Jeff Bridges wasn't even nominated for his completely amazing portrayal of a crash survivor; Rosie Perez was the only actor from this movie to receive an Oscar nomination (she, too, was brilliant).

It does drag in the middle half, and John Turturo's part is underwritten, but this is a remarkable film. The crash scenes are certainly very harrowing, but it is in the performances, music score and direction that Fearless really soars. The script is surprisingly intelligent, the story and its themes is compelling and the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. Fearless is brilliantly directed as is usually the case with Weir, and the score is one of the most haunting and emotional scores I have ever heard in a film, and I have heard a lot of them. The performances though are pretty much outstanding, bringing to life complex characters. Jeff Bridges is in my opinion a very underrated actor, and certainly a talented one. Here he gives one of his best performances as a man who is thrilled by the fact that he survived death and is convinced he is immortal. Isabella Rossellini is also remarkable as the loving wife, and Tom Hulce is fine as the well meaning attorney. And despite his underwritten role, John Turturo does what he can. But for me, the best performance came from Rosie Perez, she was truly captivating and absolutely believable as the mother who lost her young child and now completely overwhelmed by guilt and pain. Fearless isn't a very easy film to get into first time, it is emotionally heart wrenching and I think ambitious as well, the ending is proof of that. Overall, a wonderful film, minor flaws abundant but a film that deserves more recognition. 9/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"To love life, it helps to lose it","Date":"1 January 2010","Score":"5 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":" Peter Weir is unique in his ability to convey the niceties of life with authenticity.

Most of all, the film speaks of humanity's confrontation with mortality and finitude and the courage to be fully human in the face of tragedy and death. Jeff Bridges is excellent in a role that is very challenging, and he manages to hit all the right notes. Hands down, this is Rose Perez' best role, right up there with Do the Right Thing. I also think this is Peter Weir's finest moment, which is saying quite a bit, given that he's directed such wonderful films as Gallipoli, Picnic at Hanging Rock, Dead Poet's Society and Witness (okay, nevermind Truman).

Max becomes a hero in the eyes of those that he saved as well as the news media. Max for some strange reason seemed to walk away from it all as if nothing happened which to many,including the FBI, seemed weird and strange. The airline sends a trauma expert Dr. Pearlman ,John Turturro, to examine Max as well as the other survivors to see if their all right and if not what treatment they would need. The movie Fearless concentrates on two survivors and one wife of a survivor who are in some way connected to each other. Because of the tragedy. Max's friend and architect partner Jeff Gordon, John DeLancie, was killed in the crash and left a wife Nan, Deirdre O'Connell, with two little children. Jeff greedily switched the tickets that Max gave him for the flight for cheaper ones that didn't have life insurance to cover himself. Carla Rodrigo, Rosie Perez, who also survived the crash, thanks to Max, lost her little boy when he fell out of her hands and was killed. This made Carla fall into a deep depression by holding herself responsible for his death.Max's change of life after the crash comes into conflict in dealing with the realities of both Carla and Nan as well as his wife Laura, Isabella Rosselini, in getting his life back to normal. Max soon develops a fearless attitude toward death and during the movie risks his life as if he were tempting death to see somehow that if he's really dead or not. Carla is the only one who seems to bring Max back to the real world with her depression over her sons death in the crash. That makes Max go out of his way to show her that she wasn't responsible. Having Carla her sit in his car one evening and having Carla hold a tool box, as if it were her baby boy, Max then crash the car full-force into a brick wall! This was to show her that she couldn't have held on to her child to save him from the plane crash a bit insane but it worked in curing Carla of her severe guilt feelings. The car crash also settled Max's not wanting to lie about Jeff's death. Jeff's lawyer Brillstein, Tom Hulce,wanted Max to lie about the circumstances of Jeff's death to get a bigger settlement. Now Max doesn't have to testify by showing that he became suicidal because of the plane crash and thus lost control of his mental faculties. It was shown in the movie, after Max survived the plane crash, that everything that Max did he seemed to be guided by some invisible force. Like the one which had Max lead those survivors of the plane crash to safety. This unseen force made those who thought that Max was a bit strange and odd see that he was in some way a changed but better person because of it. The end of the film seemed a bit confusing but thinking about everything else in the movie that lead up to it did somehow make sense. Max, with his wife present, picks up a strawberry from Nan's lawyers batch of gifts that he had and munches on it which seems to poison and kill him. It was explained early in the movie that Max had a deadly allergic reaction to strawberries since he was a child. With everyone thinking that he's dead Max miraculously comes back to life with his wife happily holding and kissing him.We've seen earlier in the movie Max eating strawberries, again tempting death, with nothing happening to him! So why then should anything like him possibly dying from eating the strawberries happen to him now when it didn't happen before in the movie? Was it that strange force or was it Max himself in getting him and his wife Laura back together since their strained marriage, due to Max's relationship with Carla after the plane crash, which had him and his wife on the verge of separating and divorcing! Deep and interesting movie about how facing death in the present and surviving changes us for the better in facing life in the future.

This duality lies in the joy of 'mundane' life (mainly his wife and child) and the divine pleasure of the orgasmic fearlessness running through his veins after his mental acceptance of death. He can't balance both, he is unable to revive himself from his coma-like status - ghost like would be more accurate since he is quite the opposite of paralyzed, he's immortal - and the savior (he saves people after a plane crash) ironically needs to be saved himself. He eventually is in a very touching scene in the end, shouting 'I'm alive' at the top of his lungs as he is freed from the agony of being mentally dead, a scene paralleled with the last puzzle piece of the crash events and accompanied by a marvelous musical piece.

At it's most complex level when confronted head on with this fact, as many disaster survivors are, it can shake the very foundations of your being. Your relationships, religious faith, and mental health can be forced to their outer edges. It's no wonder that Bridge's and Perez's characters are so moved, and moving.

Mr. Bridges portrayal of a man who survives a lethal plane crash and thereafter, all the elements of his life; the altered state of his reality is a mind-blowing character and psychological study.  He nails it! With subtlety and at the same time in your face rawness, he takes us on his journey and makes us understand his reaction to his fate. I was deeply moved by his performance......the emotions displayed on his face without words at different times throughout the film. Like at the dinner party when he looks at his best friends widow while remembering his friends attempt to reach his wife by phone during the doomed flight. It was as though he telepathically told her....his last act was to try to reach you.......... Wow!! And when he crashed the car to save Carla from continuing to think she let go of her baby. Profound. You will know what I mean when you see this film.During the end of the film, when he is resolutely, critically made to realize that he IS ALIVE, and not dead, does he come to finally save himself.See this movie and then see yourself and your world in a new perspective. A deeply touching, human, and meaningful film.

The movie features this characters FREEDOM from the chains that bind him in life when like a kamakazie pilot he no longer fear the reaper. The film is cynical at times and has a dark humor and odd obsessions with death practices of ancient customs but is a great movie. Jeff Bridges plays this character like he knows what it is like, a mixture of euphoria and depression mixed with a psuedo religious experience auroa on his face. is the film about his hate of God or his finding of another power in the midst of his mid life confusion following the death of his friend and the crash? The film features ISABELLA ROSELLINI in a convincing role as the mans wife, who cannot come to grips with or understand what he has become. This often happens to people who lose their careers like in 1929 during the big crash or suicide bombers many psychologists say reach a state of grace before doing the unthinkable. awakening a sleeping giant and filling him with a terrible resolve to kill themselves and sometimes others. In this film the movie deals with suicide and the fear of death being removed. This man has everything to live for things most of us don't have yet in the film, he doesn't see that. He sees only trauma and the way to cope with that is to walk out in front of traffic. Sweet jesus it is liberating...to be that free. I mean when you know, in most cases people get this when no one gives a s*** whether they live or die. The mixture of facial emotions on the main characters face paint a broad canvass, i liked this movie and the dream like sequences involving the plane crash and death and it's socio-analytical view on the obsession with death.

In fact it moved me for two days after, but subsequent viewings seem to show up it's faults. It is artistically uneven, unwilling to go the whole hog and be an arthouse film and ends up somewhere between that, and a mainstream vehicle. The scene where Bridges rides the car into the wall is too much artistic licence and the pounding music generating excitement as the speedometer rose was vulgar and out of keeping with the sensitivity of other parts of the picture.The scene where Periez explains to Bridges' wife what a good friend he was to her and spent hours talking to her was one of the better and more moving scenes. Rosalini is a talented and underused actress and she does well here. I thought that Bridges' performance wasn't working at first, but in the end he really moved you. His character was not always sympathetic and he treated his wife appallingly. Nevertheless, he engrossed you so much you never question how he survived the crash untouched while his partner died sitting next to him until the film reveals the answer.The director admitted that the lawyer's role had been mostly for some light relief in a bleak tale and the actor does a good job with the ironies. This is a rare Christian film from Hollywood and speaks to people in a deeper and more adult way than normal, focusing on issues that really affect people's lives rather than the usual make believe. I haven't liked much that Peter Weir has come up with of late, especially 'Witness', but give him his due, he did a good job here.

This pithy distillation of existentialism, attempted poorly in Alien 3, is powerfully given to you without boring you to tears. The scene that contains the quintessence of the philosophy is when Bridges is terrified, like everyone else, he suddenly focuses his mind; he looks at the spinning surface through the cockpit windows. He says,I can let it go, I can just let it all go. A transcendent calm descends upon him, it is so great that the small boy and other passengers surrounding him begin pulling ontological strength from his otherworldly calm. Notice, after the crash how the boy wishes to stay with him. This is when Max is transported out of the everyday world of human existence into a place without fear. This is what the experiential scenes of bathing, driving with the wind in his hair, nothing is as it was. His family is utterly perplexed and disturbed by his transformation. Weir is teaching you 'authenticity' a central tenet of existentialism in such a clever way here. Notice Max's aversion to lies and deceit, his bluntness disturbs all around him. Even his deathly allergy is gone, he is a different individual. There is this central dynamic when the lies of which ordinary life are constructed come back, please, how do you think they keep you slaving away for decades? The lies prompt a return of the Fear which must be dispelled again by a return to Death.Authenticity's central definition, the core of existentialism, is that you must hold Death as close to you as you can stand; only by this embrace, will life's value become so real and precious to you. We see Weir show Max's estrangement from his former life to the consternation of his wife and child. Max prefers Perez's company for it brings him always back to the transformative moment when he let go. The movie is the battle of his family to return him to a 'normal' life within society's parameters of normal kind lying, deceit and materialistic acquisition, in this case, shaking down the airline for some big bucks. A project that Max has nothing but contempt for; notice always how the lying is the trigger for the return of the Fear. It is a special kind of fear, not your ordinary variety, the terror of Death. Max frees himself by returning to Death, he embraces and lets go again, restoring himself to the higher experiential plane of existence talked about so in existentialist writings of Rollo May and R.D. Laing. The movie's value is not in encouraging you to walk upon ledges or ram your car into walls at high speed. The point is to teach you that by keeping the imminence of Death with you daily, you will appreciate everything so much more your loved ones, the wind, water, the sun, existence itself.It was Weir's best movie for existentialism is a difficult philosophy to teach well. Here, Weir distills the essence for you; we don't labor upon the meaningless of life or the hostility of the universe like we did in Fincher's Alien 3. I liked that movie, for it is congruent with my philosophy, but Weir surpasses it here. You will witness the transformation of Max and his family's battle, which takes the entire movie, to return him to them. I leave it to you to judge which life you prefer; it is not for everyone. Again, just keeping Death consciously with you every day, rejecting the lies of Big Brother and his promises I find sufficient. You don't need to stand upon ledges, yes, I have occasionally, but my cared for family is long gone now. If you cannot wade through Being And Nothingness by Jean Paul Sartre, this is an excellent introduction to the very heart of the philosophy. Max's contempt for a constructed way of life built upon Fear is what he rejects so violently; notice, he speaks Truth that is ugly and painful to his listeners. I love how, when his fear returns, his allergy almost kills him. Weir has this tiny bit of Fearlessness that brings him back. I have loved it from when I first saw it, this is the movie that led me to Sartre, May and Laing. For me, my friends, every day I walk upon the Ledge.

It starts with the aftermath of a plane crash and what happens straight afterwards. Only as the film progresses do we learn about the events leading up to the crash, as well as the protagonist's personality before it happened. In this sense, the film is always a bit of an enigma, and as a result, it is engaging throughout. The music is excellent, at times ominous and always fitting the action well. The lighting and photography capture all that happens in a foreboding manner and the bird's-eye-view shots are particularly effective for showing the larger picture of certain events. The film meanders a bit too much, and delivers more questions than it answers, but it provides a lot to think about, and many intense scenes - especially the group therapy one - make it quite some ride. Bridges and Perez both deliver well, and Rossellini has some very good moments too. Above all, it manages to carry some power with it, even if one may have to suspend disbelief.

Adapted by Rafael Yglesias based on his own novel, the compelling story focuses on a San Francisco architect named Max Klein, who in the film's gripping opening scenes, has survived the devastating crash of a commercial airliner. Seemingly dazed, he walks away from the scene only to be forced to come back to his family. Weir treats the movie like an unraveling mystery as Max develops an eerie sense of invulnerability defying death with no regrets. His wife Laura gets frustrated with Max's remote behavior, while an airline therapist connects him with fellow survivor Carla, a young mother traumatized by the loss of her baby in the crash. Because of their shared experience, Max and Carla bond in ways that liberate both of them but not in directions one would expect, including an architectural tour of Oakland, California and a scary reenactment of the crash in a speeding vehicle.Despite its relentlessly downbeat tone, it is the concurrent unpredictability and almost centrifugal thrust of the plot that make the film resonate. Jeff Bridges gives a bravely unsympathetic performance as Max, as he challenges the other characters (as well as the viewer) to empathize with his character's stoic, often inexplicable actions. Just as good is Rosie Perez, who is heart wrenching as Carla, as she by default becomes the emotional heart of the film. Isabella Rossellini does what she can in the underwritten part of Laura, though her character comes across at times as too strident given the situation. Making impressions in smaller roles are John Turturro as the unctuous airline therapist, Tom Hulce as a smarmy lawyer and Benicio Del Toro as Carla's clueless husband. Allen Daviau's striking cinematography and Maurice Jarre's otherworldly music (with a nice use of U2's Where the Streets Have No Name) contribute immeasurably to the film's potency. I find the film has even more resonance in a post-9/11 world where such personalized traumas unfortunately have become even more commonplace. The 2004 DVD has no extras.

I had heard it was a good movie and that Jeff Bridges' performance was somewhat memorable in contrast to his other work.What I got however, was a beautiful film about the understanding of our own inner fears, whether they are justified or not, and by extension, our established concepts of life and death.Although I'm not giving away direct spoilers, some of the analysis might prove to show minor aspects of the narrative.We start off moments after the tragic plane crash and we are soon shown that Max, our lead character, is not reacting to his near death experience the way we would normally expect. He seems calm and not very interested in giving interviews or even getting medical attention.As the narrative progresses, we notice how other survivors deal with their horrific experience and it becomes clearer that, when people endure through such an overwhelming experience, their own psychological reactions are not really alike. That is, people's own personal experiences and fears shape how their minds are going to process such an unusual and traumatic incident. This notion is very well constructed throughout the film due to some fantastic acting, specially on Rosie Perez's part, and great writing. Indeed, the supporting cast is very well written and the characters around Max are three dimensional and pose interesting ideas all trough the film.Even still, what makes this film great and unforgettable is the constant existential debate of what it truly means to be living, backed by, in my opinion, Jeff Bridges's greatest performance yet. After surviving the plane crash, Max loses the sense of fear as he comes to the conclusion that life and death are, ultimately, out of our control. With that said, is there necessity for rational fear or any instinct of preservation?The ending serves as an interpretation of the answer to this question. It only helps that the final crash scene is one of the most memorable and emotional scenes I have ever seen. We are shown how terrifying and destructive the sight of a disaster can be. The final scene works almost as a film in its own right by showing how people try to cope with the fact that death is imminent, and at the same time beautifully showing Max's transition into the mind state he was in through the entire film up until the end.It is hard to understand how such a film is not more broadly known and praised. Perhaps a more thorough study of the marketing process or the box office context could serve as an answer, but not an excuse. Jeff Bridges is sensational and delivers a dominant performance. He truly is one of the most underrated actors of his generation. After seeing this film, I doubt many would disagree with me. In the end, Peter Weir's Fearless stands on its own as one of the great movies from the 90's, even if not many people are aware of it.

I've no actual idea how Iglesias had come to have such a =deep= understanding of the symptoms of complex post-traumatic stress disorder, but... a great deal of what I saw in this wonderful film points directly to the remarkable body of work done by Dr. Bessel van der Kolk at Harvard in the 1970s and '80s.

What he saw then, and what many of us have witnessed since then is that such people have to force bits and pieces of the experience out of consciousness into vaults with pass codes and combinations they may never be able to remember. The upshots of that fragmentation often include crazy behavior designed to make sure those vaults are sealed forever.Fearless was therapeutic for me.

Max, the survivor, reaches some type of spiritual nirvana when facing death directly, and is reborn in a way. However, he feels as if he's already dead, and he sees the rest of the survivors in the same way. This makes for an interesting character study, exploring what happens when one embraces fully both fear and death. Jeff Bridges has by far the best performance in the film, and showed much of the needed emotion to keep the movie afloat. The rest of the cast did a decent job (though I didn't like the child actors), and Tom Hulce was great in his little part as a greedy lawyer.However, I felt the movie lacked some focus at some parts. The beginning was great, and so was the end. In the middle, I felt some ups and downs, and some scenes fell flat in contrast to some of the better scenes in the film. After the beginning, the film constantly flashed religious themes without much subtlety, but those stopped after the middle of the movie. The relationship between Max and Carla, another survivor, was interesting enough - but I didn't feel the actress playing Carla did the best job she could. The psychiatrist was rather superfluous to the story, and Max's wife was rather ignored in the first half of the film and didn't get enough depth afterwards in my opinion. The directing was interesting at times and unnoticeable in others, but it was overall solid. I think the script has the biggest issues of the movie - some of the lines were hideous in my opinion, and the plot itself felt a tad not fully organized. To sum up, even though I found the film good, there were too many flaws in it which kept taking me out of the movie. The ongoing themes of Christianity felt rather annoying and preachy, some characters didn't contribute much to the emotional depth of the film, and some of the dialogues felt extremely fake to me.

It's one of the best films no ones heard of in the nineties, and it may even have a career best performance from Bridges and the rest of the cast.It's a difficult subject matter to deal with, people trying to come to terms with loss, whereas one man, is doing everything in his power to prove everyone that something enigmatic, even sublime, happened to him on the plane.The film would be perfect if it had the same power in the third act, like it did in the first two, but sadly, it runs a little out of steam.The scenes on the plane are very intense and genuinely terrifying, but somewhat peaceful thanks to Bridges calming influence.The film is asking lots of questions throughout, but if you go that little much deeper, rather than look at it at face value, it gets a little lost also (there are some scenes, that are indicating that Bridges is really dead, and in purgatory, which can be confusing at times).But all in all, if you ever come across this movie, you must take some time out to see i, it's an amazing movie with an amazing message, it just loses it's way a little in the last 30 mins.

This is the story of airplane crash survivor, Max Klien (played by that sexy bitch, Jeff Bridges), who is revered as a hero for having pulled survivors from the wreckage and walking away without a scratch.The experience is a life-changing one as he becomes so very pacified (kind of like Motorcyle Boy, upon his return in 'Rumble Fish') and tests his potential for invincibility. Except, what changes him, draws him further apart from his family, as they now exist on a different plane having not shared the same experience and being unable to empathize with Max's new perceptions. (And this movie is really good at kind of personalizing Max's new outlook as we get some sense of his invincibility). Consequently, it draws him closer to fellow survivor, Carla (Rosie Perez), who lost her infant son in the crash and blames herself. Max teaches her to let go and stop blaming herself. It is a mix of a story struggling to understand and identify himself as well something of a love story (to some extent). With an original story and a tremendous cast (Isabella Rossellini plays Max's wife, Benicio Del Toro as Carla's husband, and my favorite, John Tuturo as Max's therapist in addition to many others). It is movie that works its emotions effectively and tries to draw the viewer in as much as possible. A must see when you're in the mood for something different, but not totally bizarre.

I say yes AND no none of us is immortal, and when we behave as if we ARE (as a true, self-centered, self-destructing alcoholic IS doing, albeit in a rather perverse fashion), then we are trying to play God. When we think we are God, we are in trouble...When alcoholics/addicts/spiritually sick people behave in this extreme destructive, self-centered, death-defying I AM God fashion, their lives are by default on a collision-course with all of those around them. Alcoholics/addicts are often described as tornados tearing through the lives of others with destructive force (there's a scene with Isabella Rossellini & John Turturro at the dance school with the tornado reference).Alcoholics have a hard time just being right-sized, they have to be greater-than or less-than all others. Only by getting out of themselves; by helping others, being of service for selfless reasons, only THEN can they be whole spiritually.This is the journey our protagonist must make. He must both help others for the right reasons and re-visit another near-death experience to truly understand his own mortality. He HAS to react to the strawberry allergy at the end of the movie (alcoholism is often characterized as an allergy, and, like Jeff with the strawberry, an alcoholic or an addict who continues to indulge even with overwhelming evidence that it may kill him is engaging in the ultimate dance with death.). Only by facing our own mortality can we appreciate the value of life. Alcoholics/addicts in recovery like to say religion is for those who don't want to go to hell; spirituality is for those who have been there and don't want to go back.Am I nuts, or did anyone else get this???

When the FBI finds him, he insists on flying back to San Francisco. Everybody is overjoyed. However he is distant from his wife Laura (Isabella Rossellini) and son Jonah. His business partner Jeff Gordon (John de Lancie) was killed in the crash. Lawyer Brillstein (Tom Hulce) wants him to exaggerate for Jeff's wife Nan (Deirdre O'Connell)'s settlement.

Unable to cope, Perlman connects him to grief stricken survivor Carla Rodrigo (Rosie Perez) and her callous husband Manny (Benicio Del Toro) after the death of her baby in the crash.I like the idea and I find the first act rather fascinating. Walking away from the crash is such a great opening. However I got a bit tired of Jeff Bridges' zen master performance and I found his character rather annoying. I want to find some insight or some revelation. Instead, he's a bit of a douchey socialpath. He needs a few more explosive moments. It's great that he has a panic attack after Nan puts him in his place. I also find the compensation discussion interesting. It could have added more of that into the movie. Rosie Perez plays a depressed angry character. It gets a bit depressing to watch her. It is hard to get my hands around these characters.

From the terrifying crash sequence to Jeff Bridges walk on a roof top and his physics lesson for the benefit of Rosie Perez, Fearless owes its considerable emotional impact to the Rafael Yglesias novel of the same name. No surprise since Yglesias wrote the screenplay.What I found surprising is that Yglesias did not receive even a nomination for the screenplay. Schindler's List won, but I still ask, how did Fearless not receive a nomination? Bridges, Isabella Rossellini and Perez brought the script to life with brilliant performances, but the story of Fearless is in the story. It is a rare examination of the effect of experience on human behavior and personality, and the courage that a few find in those experiences. Insanity never was so valuable as it is in Fearless. "}{"Title":"A profound meditation on death, guilt, fear ... and ultimately, life ...","Date":"5 May 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":" Fearless awakened one of the most bizarre thoughts that ever crossed my mind envy toward people who lived near death experiences, for the certitude that these people would never be the same again, and when you try to be someone else, any option is worth considering.Fearless takes place during the aftermath of a plane crash that presumably killed most passengers and left a few survivors in a state of shock. Are they privileged? Maybe from our perspective, but most of them would endure the trauma of having witnessed the death of a friend, a parent or even the seat neighbor. Most of them would endure the survivor's guilt. Not to mention the traumatic landing and the subsequent lottery of death. Peter Weir's movie, based on a novel by Rafael Iglesias, explores the complexities of the human soul from the different ways it reacts to a life-changing experience. The most intriguing case is Max Klein, an architect and family man, played by Jeff Bridges. Around him, it's chaos, mayhem, panic, cries and cadavers yet he walks like along the site, floating on a cloud of extraordinary serenity. He's not just a survivor, but also a savior, he gave a baby back to his mom, helped a little boy who was flying alone, he showed the safe way to many distraught passengers. Yet, the film doesn't focus on his heroic status, which he himself declines, it is more about the perception of life and death when you have been walking on the thin tightrope that separate the two worlds, when you 'saw the tunnel leading to a light'.Speaking of 'light', the narrative is punctuated by a few flashbacks that reveal how normally scared Max was during the flight, while sitting next to his best friend and colleague. It's only after the situation got more critical, that a mysterious heavenly light appeased his thoughts, and filled his heart with the serene confidence he would live. The crash sequence, which is among one of the most realistic, haunting and emotional from any other film, give some interesting insights that are later 'contradicted' by Max. The way he sees it he's already a ghost, God can't touch him, he shares the little secret with Carla, a Hispanic mother who lost her child and can't recover from the guilt of not having held him tightly in her arms. Max and Carla form two interesting cases. Max survived and believe he's invulnerable, 'fearless' as the title suggest, with an inexorable desire to live life to its fullest, and the consequence is that it affects its relationships with his entourage. He becomes totally estranged to his wife, played by Isabella Rosselini (whose uncanny resemblance with her legendary was almost distracting), he lost the fatherly bond with his son in favor of the one he rescued, he couldn't even find the right words for his friend's widow or cooperate with the lawyer's desperate efforts to obtain a huge indemnity. Max rejects life's normality money, convention, fear, video games, living with memories, his idea of the perfect life to live is a personal utopia that can only be fulfilled with someone who understands him. And this person is Carla. Played by Rosie Perez, Carla is the emotional core of the film, through the reaction most viewers can relate to, she's not a kind of super-human or angel, she only tried to save her son, but failed. And this failure puts her in a depressive state with suicidal impulses that only her deep Hispanic Catholic faith can alter. Contrarily to Max, Carla is much aware that she's living and that's what makes her life unbearable, for Max, the idea of death is so intolerable that he teases it by eating strawberries, a fruit he's allergic to, crossing the road, or walking on the ledge of a building's roof in the film's most emblematic scene. Fear is connected with self-preservation, but in Max' case, the fearless state doesn't mean he doesn't want to live, but it betrays his sentiment of inner immortality, yet the only way to be immortal is to be actually dead. Max is still between life and death. Either the wish to be dead out of guilt or sensation of being already dead from a weird exhilaration, both Perez and Bridges drive the film through sensitive and sensational performances. The therapist, played by John Turturro, explains to Max' wife that both Max and Carla represent two extremes in terms of reactions and on their interactions can depend chances of recovery. The relationship has a romantic vibe and maybe Max genuinely loves Carla, but Fearless never lures us into the idea that Carla would fall in love with him on the simple basis that they had the same experience. Love is not an end but a mean for Max to suppress all the traces of guilt in Carla's mind. Ironically, that's what Max' wife tries to do, helping him to regain his faith in life, and her many attempts to give a helping hand are concluded by 'failure to communicate', leading to what seems to be marital dead-end. But there is a reason Rosie Perez' performance was so acclaimed, she's not just a weepy, mourning mother, there is strength in her heart, and if her recovery can put and end to the mystical bond she had with Max, it leaves at least some room for the woman who really loves him. The conclusion of Fearless, perhaps one of the most emotionally satisfying ever, is perfect because it does three things it provides some answers about Max' enigmatic state of mind, it finds the perfect remedy, and it highlights the truth that one of the best things about life is to realize how great it is to live. Those who faced death have more awareness, and maybe this is what I consider their privilege. Do I want it? I'm not sure I'm that &#x85; fearless.

I loved it, and I think that the people who hated it, or were bored by it, just didn't 'get it'.  This is probably the best film out there that deals with the inescapable emotional aftermath of a sudden, catastrophic disaster.  The beginning and ending of this film are breathless experiences that need to be seen to be described. Jeff Bridges is flawless, as are his supporting characters. The one scene that I think is the most 'real' of the film is the survivor's counseling group that is supposed to help the victims of this disaster, yet end up causing even more pain and sadness.  Sadistic, as one survivor calls it.  It just shows how a vague, general practice like counseling is too non-specific to help complex individuals like Max.  People like Max need to find their own solution for their situation.  The car/toolbox scene is a perfect example of the 'logic' that Max invents in this film.  Some would deem what he did crazy; however, for him and Carla, is was necessary.  Same with the strawberry at the end. "},{"Title":"Brief Summary of Fearless With My Own Personal Opinions","Date":"2 December 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":"  SPOILER ALERT!!!!! Max and hundreds of others are in a dive towards the ground, the plane is out of control and cannot be saved for anything. But amazingly, Max survives and finds the strength to get the other survivors off the plane. Although Max does not believe it himself, he is a hero to the survivors and their families. Max actually feels like he cheated death, but he takes this `second chance' to find his inner peace. On the way to finding to his inner peace, he helps Carla, played by Rosie Perez, find her way back to the reality of the world. While helping Carla, who feels responsible for her baby's death, his own family is falling apart right before his eyes. His wife, played by Isabella Rossellini, does not understand his new-found friendship with Carla, and starts to  become jealous of their relationship, pulling her away from Max. She also does not understand his new journey, which also pulls her away. This movie is a great look at how humans cope with dramatic, life-altering events, and gives us a great look at humanity and how they react to different situations. In Max's case, he reacted in such a way that even he did not know what to think. One example of how Max reacted oddly was when he had a panic attack in the lawyer's office. Max ran to the roof, sat in a corner, stood on the ledge, screamed at the top of his lungs, then spun in circles. He knew what he was doing, but he probably did not know why he was doing it. He made a comment to his wife that he did not want to make sense, but I think he may have made this comment because he did not understand why he was acting the way he was. Max knew what he was doing, he believed that he was trying to find his inner peace, but he was only doing it because he felt immortal. The reason I say this is because when he almost got hit by a car, he looked up at the sky and screamed (at God?), `You can try to kill me but you can't!' Another odd thing that Max did, in result of his PTSD, is he went to the mall with Carla and convinced her that it was okay to buy presents for her deceased son and his deceased dad.  It made each of them feel better as they were shopping, but afterwards Carla felt even worse. She told Max that she was the reason her san, Bubble, died. She confessed that she had let go of him thinking that it was safe, but that is when he fell and died. Trying to convince Carla that her son's death was not her fault, Max had the `crazy' idea of driving into a brick wall while Carla held the tool box that he had just bought for his father. He crashed the car, Carla let go of the tool box, and his point was proven. However, he ended up in the hospital while Carla was fine. At this point in the movie, Max's wife knows that his relationship with Carla is something of a problem. Carla sees this as well. At this point, Carla decides to go see Max's wife and talk to her. They decide that Carla will no longer see Max. So, Carla goes to see Max at the hospital and tell him. Max does not understand why Carla will no longer see him, and he refuses to say good bye to her. He eventually gives Carla a small wave good-bye, but he never actually says it. This is probably a result of his PTSD. He does not know how to cope with any situations the he doe not have control over, and he just smiles it off and lets the situation pass. When Max is finally out of the hospital, he goes home and tells his wife to save him. She does not know what he means and before she can ask, he leaves the kitchen and goes to the living room to meet their lawyer, who brought over champagne and a large fruit basket to celebrate their victory in the case against the airline that Max's crash was involved in. Max reached into the fruit basket and grabbed a strawberry and took a bite out of it. Allergic to strawberries, his wife ran over and hit the rest of the strawberry out of his hand before he could finish it. Falling to the floor, Max began to die, seeing `the light.' He also heard his wife calling to him, `Don't leave. don't die.' Following his wife's voice, Max `came back to life,' hugging his wife. That was the end of the movie. I think Max made this dramatic leap toward death knowing that he would die, hence him telling his wife to save him. I think this was the final push for him, and he finally had found what he was looking for his inner peace. When someone has PTSD, they handle it in many different ways. Carla, for example, was traumatized and could not cope in the realities of the world. Max, on the other hand, handled his PTSD with a smile and a great outlook, trying to find a new self. I really liked this movie, especially enjoying the bits and pieces of humor. I learned a lot, too. For example, I never knew that someone would handle their stress like Max did. I always thought that someone with PTSD would act like Carla did. However, I learned more than I anticipated I would and would definitely suggest this movie to others interested in PTSD, or even to friends who want an eventful film to watch.

Instead of giving the lead character, Max Klein (played perfectly by Jeff Bridges), some nice, Psych 101 textbook syndrome that is condescendingly explained to us by a  shrink character, the film concentrates on drawing the audience inside his head so that we can see in a way why he feels like he does.  His reaction to the crash is a complete lack of fear.  Whenever he begins to feel afraid, he is compelled to do something almost suicidally dangerous to prove to himself that he can overcome the fear again.  This leads to some visually extraordinary scenes.  We are also shown other crash survivors with different reactions, including, most importantly Carla Rodrigo (Rosie Perez), who strikes up a friendship with Max Klein.  Although the characters often do some very strange, and sometimes implausible, things (which I won't describe so as not to give away the movie), they make sense in the context of the characters' development.Notable in the film is an amazingly effective use of music.  U2's Where the Streets Have No Name and the first movement of Henryk Gorecki's beautiful Third Symphony both put in apppearances at extremely critical times in the movie, strongly enhancing the emotional impact of the scenes.Overall Rating 9 (out of 10), or 4 stars (out of 4) "},{"Title":"A film with a narrative of emotions.","Date":"18 October 1998","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":"  Fearless is fantastic film.

Nobody gay (even tho Max lives in SF) ... but the way Max is in a daze, knowing that because he changed his seat at the last minute he's walking around while his friend has suffered a horrible death... no gay movie, no aids-related movie has ever captured that...

Peter Weir (Dead Poets Society, Picnic at Hanging Rock, et al.) has crafted a beautiful, haunting, and inescapable examination of what happens when an ordinary person stares Death in the face, and emerges victorious.Jeff Bridges (in the performance of a lifetime, which should have won him an Oscar) plays Max Klein, a cosmetically happy San Francisco architect who survives a plane crash which claims the lives of over 100 people, including his best friend.In the aftermath, Max adopts an almost fatalistic state of mind; having cheated death once, he feels himself to be invincible.What transpires after this is patently indescribable, but suffice it to say that Bridges heartbreakingly conveys a subtle, wounded megalomania after this tragic event, establishing a touching rapport with the mother of a child who died in the crash (Oscar-nominated Rosie Perez) while his connection with his son and wife (Isabella Rosselini, never better) grows ever more slight.This film is deeply personal to me, as my father is a recent cancer survivor and I, myself, narrowly escaped an attempted murder along with two of my friends.Fearless is a remarkable film -- not only in that it tries to establish an order, and purpose, in the seeming randomness of events, but in that it also underlines what a fragile condition humanity is; how a life can be saved, or lost, in a single moment.For those who have some perspective on brushes with death, Fearless is a poignant examination of how we deal with it. For those who don't, it's a poignant examination of how to deal with those who have.For those who don't care, it's still one heck of a good movie. Treat yourself to the best film of 1993 -- one that blows Schindler's List out of the water.

Many emotional sequences following the disaster give the picture its heart and soul, but the final chapter brings us back to reality with too mighty a pull, and how satisfying the movie ultimately is depends on whether the viewer can forgive the underlying feeling of manipulation. Still, the film is startlingly straightforward and directed with focused, intense human passion by Weir. Terrific supporting performance by Isabella Rossellini as Bridges' exceptionally patient and understanding spouse Rosie Perez, successfully underplaying as a fellow crash survivor having troubles of her own, is also quite good. *** from **** "},{"Title":"Not exactly 'fearless', but 'surefooted' direction can both benefit and hinder...","Date":"12 August 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":"  I watched this and Mulholland Drive back-to-back. (I rated them both a '6')  Both Lynch and Weir are directors who know how to build moods; and this asset might be more important than any one thing you see onscreen.  Fearless is certainly the more 'linear' film of the two, but both aim to get the viewer in their gut rather than with standout scenes.A lot of the time Fearless succeeds in this intention, but ironically it might just be the undoing of the film as well.  You could say it's like directing transposed to a poker game, and a lot of the time I found myself thinking Am I being shown a hand when I THINK I am, or is it just a bluff?  It's smoke and mirrors, details are revealed at odd moments but never without purpose.  It's sometimes comforting not to have to doubt at any time that the director is in control; but it's a competence that could ultimately hurt the film; the core of it embracing so totally as it does the concept of 'abandon'.Two characters in the film bond through their shared notion of something 'cosmic' that alienates the outsiders around them.  Peter Weir is so confident with his material though, that it becomes almost like a gang of three.  The character 'couple' know what they're doing/where they're going, and so does the director, but an audience member not attuned to such ethereal moments might feel stranded at times.  It's almost like the story will only really 'connect' if you've lived through it YOURSELF, rather than offering much insight from a 'distanced' perspective.  This is compounded by our never being told more than we NEED to know about Max.  This approach may have worked for some people, but I can't say it really did for me...A definite 'plus' regarding this route comes from the role of Jeff Bridges.  Ever the interesting performer whatever the circumstances, he's permitted to be fascinatingly enigmatic here, and this only serves to make his work all the more hypnotic.  Jarringly disrupting this, though, is Rosie Perez.  She undermines yet another film via her grating vocals alone, although excepting this she's certainly dramatically adequate.  This role, unlike White Men Can't Jump, doesn't need someone whose permanent setting is 'shrill', and that subtracts from the moments where otherwise she's doing good work.Max's initial unwavering confidence and insensitivity to his wife at times does this to the film as a WHOLE, too; isolating people when perhaps I would have felt better had he been an emissary spreading the good word.  Hell, it worked fine in movies like Phenomenon for one; and THAT was with a director and material that were substantially less accomplished than this project sports.  'Engaging' though it was, I'm more inclined to think of this as a missed opportunity, then, as far as I'm concerned...

The aftermath of the character and his connections with the world... is what 'Fearless' is all about.'Fearless' begins wonderfully, but 40-minutes into the film, it loses the pace. Even the culmination leaves a lot to be desired. Weir's direction is satisfactory, but the Screenplay has loose-ends.

So I watched this with curiosity at first. And then boredom. And then a kind of draining disappointment. I can see how the drama, and the various characters involved in it, might really draw someone in and move them. So this is just my own take on it, a fair balance to the others, I hope.The shock of being in a plane crash is played out by Jeff Bridges as a young professional who survives. This is gripping enough in the first scenes. This survival is played out through Bridges over the next fews days as he visits other survivors and sees the range of their inabilities to cope. Throughout, Bridges is asked to play with a calm that at first seems to be a blank slate for our growing into his complexity. His own complete acceptance and almost joy at having survived seems to have no down side, except having to run from television cameras or stand on rooftops screaming. Normal things, I suppose. This is how we are made to see his mind working through the horror he has repressed. But the blankness is a cover for an unresolved shock, and this doesn't unfold easily. Von Trier or Bergman or even Hitchcock might have made art out of this, but Weir can't pull it off. His earlier movies are gems of situation, of how groups of people behave within circumstances. Fearless is different in that it goes inward, trying to be about a person's mind. And yet, Weir still plays Bridges as if he were foremost a character among other characters. When we do go inward, it is mostly through his memories of the event, which are given predictable elements of fear and horror. (It's a plane crash, after all.) As for how Bridges copes, you will see either beatific gazes or screaming to himself.The basic idea is great movie material, but I didn't find the psychology convincing. The writing is stilted and worn out before it starts. The narrative is broken up with cheap flashbacks and with irrelevant and unconvincing scenes of tacky lawyers looking for money. Clichés. Even the extended and manipulative ending, which by that point is so unnecessary and indulgent for all its fire and visions of heaven, just leaves you feeling battered.

I remember the first of his movies I saw, The Last Wave, in Palo Alto, when it was released. I'd never seen anything quite like it. And then, shortly afterward, Picnic at Hanging Rock, which left me hanging at a much more tentative angle than the rock. Not all of his movie have been so mysterious, so bounced around, but Fearless is. Like The Last Wave it has a fuzzy supernatural element.Jeff Bridges and a few other passengers, Rosie Perez among them, survive a horrible fiery airplane crash in California. Bridges and Perez can't get their lives together afterward. Perez, having lost her baby in the accident, blames herself and is depressed almost beyond speech. Bridges, on the other hand, feels he is now indestructible and is, furthermore, some kind of supernatural agent left on earth to help Perez recover. His near-death experience has restructured his life. He feels he is invincible. He goes to lengths that anyone would describe as extreme in order to prove it.Bridges is always good. He always brings something extra to the role, although at times he overreaches. Rosie Perez isn't the Puerto Rican spitfire she usually is. She's subdued (for her) and effective in the character of a woman who has to realize that her baby's death was not her responsibility. Some comic moments are added by Tom Hulce as a bespectacled nervous wreck of a lawyer who sincerely wants to be sympathetic and get rich doing it. (I know, I know, I'm a bad guy because I'm trying to get money. Don't bother saying it!) Isabella Rossellini is the increasingly distraught wife who can't understand why her husband is growing more distant, more ethereal, and appears to be falling in love with the woman he's trying to help.It isn't one of Weir's most provocative movies but once you get into it the narrative sweeps you up, partly because you can't help wondering where the hell it's all headed. The climax seems mundane after all that portent.

It seemed to be very strange and hard to connect to. But it has a very triumphant ending that is worth the wait (and weight of the rest of the movie).The fits and starts and heaviness of the film comes together. I came to realize that my uneasiness with the movie, shot long before 9/11 is the trauma that I still feel (and we feel as a people) at tragic accidents. Perhaps all of us are still in Post Traumatic Stress Disorder after 9/11 even though as I write this it is November of 2006. Maybe it is this same disorder that has our leadership so confused, wanting to do something, but not knowing what can be done, really, and doing too little too late, resulting only in more confusion.So what is disturbing about this movie is really that the subject matter (accidents and death and survivor's guilt) are so disturbing. You feel murky and uneasy because you identify so much with the character. But it comes right in the end. Because, whatever it is, Life is brief. And with all of the unsolved mysteries and pain and suffering, there is something glorious about every moment we're alive.I don't fly much anymore, but I used every opportunity when I did to think that question What if I don't land at the other end? What if this is it? Life seemed all the sweeter for having survived the trip. It's the same with this movie.So see it, but be prepared to wrestle with your own discomfort (as the scenes where skyscrapers were being shown and I felt myself begging don't show the twin towers!).

In many ways Fearless is one of the most twisted and disturbing films because it's about a very real man with a very real and serious disorder caused by this horrific event. The film is intense and intelligent and you almost feel pain watching how much anguish one woman and even the man are in. The man doesn't even recognize his anguish and is losing everything because of it.The incomparable Jeff Bridges is lead character Max Klein. During the plane crash he helped several other survivors out of the wreckage and they hailed him a hero. Unfortunately the crash has made Max fall completely out of reality. He's addicted to the rush he felt, he's disconnected from those who don't understand how it felt to be certain he would die. Bridges is so emotional and has such a kind and down to earth face that he brings out emotions inside himself and everyone watching the film. The performance was just breathtaking. How he got passed by for an Oscar in this film is beyond me?? Max Klein was one of the most deep and disturbing characters I'd ever seen. He had so many layers to him and he was fascinating to watch. Rosie Perez plays grieving mother and crash survivor Carla Rodrigo who can't forgive herself for not protecting her two year old son better during the crash. Perez is a little over the top but taps the grief stricken aspect perfectly. I've never been a fan of hers but certainly she pulls out all the stops and gives her best performance in Fearless. I don't know if I can say she was deserving of the Oscar and the 6 other awards she was at least nominated for in this role. I only say that because Bridges was completely shut out and together they made an incredibly powerful and provocative team. Now I admit this next actress is one of my least favorite. Isabella Rossellini plays Max's wife Laura. She may be the daughter of a legend but her acting skills from what I have seen are sub par at best. I find her straight faced, monotone and boring. Her role as Laura Klein was only slightly improved from that. Her and Bridges were ridiculous together as a couple and she always looked angry even when she wasn't. Any brief moments of talent she shows are only because she gets to play off of Bridges' brilliance. Tom Hulce is perfectly shady and slimy as the cash in on it all lawyer for the group of them. John Turturro makes a brief but effective appearance as the Psyciatrist to the Airport. And finally young Spencer Vrooman does well as Bridges' son Jonah.Truly the reason to see Fearless is Jeff Bridges which is quite often the case with a Jeff Bridges film. He is so talented and is so incredibly versatile as an actor and his performance in this film just draws you in and captivates and frightens. It's like nothing I've ever seen in a character. Director Peter Weir is certainly a versatile director having done everything from Historical epics to romantic comedies, drama, war films etc. His films seem to carry a certain darkness to them, almost a gritty, sad, humor. I think he adds this flare to Fearless in the same way he did for such incredible films like The Truman Show, and Dead Poets Society. He seems to capture human spirit in any form better than any other director. Fearless is absolutely worth seeing, it's intelligent and beautiful and very, very sad.

Here's whyThe movie did not deliver enough entertainment value. Thought provoking it was but entertaining- questionable.Also, the way the movie handled its core issues and themes seemed a little heavy handed to me. The old chestnut about script writing that the dialogue should never be totally on the nose was not adhered to, in this case to the film's detriment. I found some of the dialogue to be too direct and not leaving enough room for subtext and for the viewer to feel that there is something bubbling beneath the surface. Its always better for the writer to sketch the character's struggles as metaphors and incidental to the story rather than try to force themes to lead the story and drive its dialogue. Additionally, the Director's use of camera shots was a little slow. The style of, Look at me, here is another important closeup on some random object for longer than we would like, coupled with the writing served to make the movie a bit melodramatic. Aside from Jeff Bridges who does a solid job in a decent role, Benicio Del Toro was very interesting in his minor role as was John Torturro.You will see a lot of rave reviews for Fearless largely because it has a small cult following who were emotionally impacted by it. As a regular viewer with no special connection to the film, I advise you to take these reviews with a grain of salt. They are biased. This is not a flawless film. It is merely an interesting one with a couple good actors. Definitely Not a must see. I also wasn't crazy about Rosie Perez.

However the final 10 minutes where Max confronts his fears while the plane crash is relived in flashback is intensely moving, (the crash never focusing on gore but rather the sheer terror and panic).Bridges is good, but I feel he overdoes the mystical side of his character and makes him a little hard to swallow.

This isn't the first time I've felt this way about a Peter Weir film when Dead Poets Society came out, everyone appeared to be going head over heels for the movie, but I found it to be a rather mediocre melodrama. I think Fearless is an improvement, but I still think Weir can do better. Jeff Bridges plays an architect named Max Klein who survives a plane crash and becomes trapped in a state of nonchalant intrepidness he walks across busy freeways, enthusiastically snacks on strawberries even though he knows he's allergic to them, and stands on the edge of a skyscraper's roof while twirling around in circles with his hands in the air. When he's driving his car with a fellow crash survivor (Rosie Perez) sitting nervously in the passenger seat, he says I'm an excellent driver with all the blind confidence of Raymond Babbitt. His wife (Isabella Rossellini) doesn't understand what's happened to him -- and he boldly informs her that she never will --, but Perez, who lost her infant in the accident, does. Together, they try to return to normality while wishing they could remain on the higher ground they've just discovered. Based on that synopsis, Fearless sounds like a pretty good movie, and in spite of its many flaws, I guess it is. But I'm still having a hard time trying to ignore those flaws. Fearless was, for the most part, excluded from any major awards -- that is, with the exception of Perez, who received immense acclaim for her performance. Upon hearing this, I was shocked I was shocked because, in my opinion, she was the main thing that DIDN'T work in the movie. Not only is she not particularly good, but her excruciating sentimentalism destroys every line of dialogue she forcefully recites. Just when I thought I was starting to enjoy the movie, she would open her mouth again and I became unable to concentrate on anything but her inadequacy -- which is a shame, because the rest of the performances were rather outstanding. Bridges is simply terrific, bringing his wry humanity to its peak and stealing every scene. Rossellini is equally great (she remains one of the most criminally underused actresses in Hollywood today), and the supporting cast includes John Turturro, Benicio del Toro, and Tom Hulce (who received an Oscar nomination for the title role in Milos Forman's Amadeus). I have not read the novel by Rafael Yglesias, but since he adapted the screenplay himself, I'll assume that it's fairly similar to the movie it has its ups and downs, but overall it's fairly tight. Weir is obviously a talented director, creating some scenes that are so great they remind us why we go to the movies in the first place (that is, when Perez isn't getting in the way). The ending scene alone is a tour-de-force. The score is also very peculiar (in a good way), sounding like a B-side of the soundtrack for Stanley Kubrick's The Shining -- except for the ending theme, which is almost operatic. I really want to like this movie, and I think I'll watch it a second time for that sole purpose -- but as long as Rosie Perez is still in it, it's going to be difficult.Grade B+ "},{"Title":"A bit of a letdown","Date":"18 May 2003","Score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":"  I rented this movie on the strength of the reviews listed here.As it turns out, the movie does have a very fascinating premise about a man who stares his own impending death in the face and discovers that he is not afraid to die.Unfortunately, what the other reviews have neglected to mention is that Max (the protagonist) turns out to have almost a continual death wish thereafter as he seeks quite irrationally to recover that same sense of peace.In my opinion, this drags the movie off course.  It could've dealt with some very interesting philosophical issues about life, death, and meaning.

Isabella Rossellini is good in her part, but rather an unlikable character in my opinion. Rosie Perez once again annoyed the heavens out of me, with her constant sniveling and shouting. Overrated much? John Turturro is solid in his role while Benicio Del Toro is solid too.Bottom line. Well made, well acted, but a boring experience that riddled me with depression. Worth a look, but that's about it. Maybe you'll get more out of it then I did.5/10 "},{"Title":"Tripe","Date":"25 March 2000","Score":"7 out of 17 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":"      Fearless is a terribly didactic and maudlin film.  As a lover of movies, it pains me to say this about one, but I hated it.  I felt like I was being made to feel that I wasn't living life to the fullest because I didn't thoroughly enjoy my last strawberry.  The last thing I want is to be made to feel less than someone without being inspired to reach their heights.  I thought Jeff Bridges' character was a jerk and Rosie Perez's was an annoyance.  The two of them reminded me of my Sesame Street days, which were not long ago.  Each line they delivered sounded like those of muppets Rosie like Elmo and Jeff like Fozzie Bear.  Every time he spoke, I found myself picturing him in a goofy little hat and covered with fur, which made his moral instructions hard to take seriously.  If you like Jeff Bridges, check him out as The Dude in The Big Lebowski.    There were also many irrelevant subplots that of the woman he visits after the crash, the role of the psychiatrist and the scheming lawyer (a terrible character, stereotypically unctuous and over-acted by Tom Hulce, yes, Wolfie), and the clingy kid.  All detours that could have been productive had the film ever led up to anything with the main story, let alone the sidetrips.               Great crash scene, however, very well done to beautiful music and in wonderful luminescence.  But the rest, like a strawberry, is hard to swallow.

On seeing it, I have to say I'd put it without question with the ranks of Pay It Forward as a film that sets up a realm to discuss something truly profound, but instead gives in to cheap weepy melodrama and a very empty philosophy from a promising premise. I even felt, at moments, as if I smelled the indelicate hand of Mimi Leder at work. I could hardly believe this was the director who brought us Dead Poet's Society.I have so many questions for Mr. Weir. What is this film talking about? Loss? Life? Death? Trauma? Recovery? Love? The film's theme wander's about as often as the it's dialog contradicts itself. Are twisted moments like buying gifts for the dead supposed to be heartwarming? Why does Jeff Bridges' character, who is supposed to have undergone a profound and meaningful revelation, seem to constantly change his mind? Why cast loud- mouthed bronxer Rosie Perez as the sensitive character of the mother who loses her child? You know from the script we're gonna have to watch that girl cry a lot... oh OK, that makes sense. Cast the most abrasive person possible to do the job. Why is Max's wife spontaneously Italian? Did Rossellini just seem like a big enough name to cast that accent without its having any relation whatsoever to the story? How did you manage to make John Turturro boring? Characters and plot lines come and go, and I can smell the stench of coffee and cigarettes in the novelists office as he tries to figure out how to fill the inconvenient space between an interesting set up and a mildly poetic, if inconsistent ending. Default to what all the cheapest modern dramatists do fill it with TV-quality melodramatic tripe.I was so relieved to see the budget flesh out a few million in the final sequence, because I was terrified that, since it only raked in 7 million at the box office, this paperback picture might have made money despite the wise choice of the majority of audiences to avoid it like a Sharon Stone film.

The main guy, Jeff Bridges, was VERY good as the person who was spared in a plane crash.  It's interesting to see his demeanor on life after he goes from person to person to talk about the accident.  I loved this movie so much.  It was classic and the ending was perfect.  One of the best scenes was when Jeff Bridges runs into a wall during a U2 song!!The worst part of this movie is that filty piece of trash known as Rosie Perez.Good flick.

Rosie Perez does nothing but cry about her lost son named Bubble.  After 10 minutes you will be so sick of hearing her cry for Bubble, that you will want to punch your TV set.Watching Jeff Bridges in an extreme close-up eat a strawberry...this is art? This is drama??  This is boring. "}]
