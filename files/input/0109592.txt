[{"Title":"A zombie flick with a brain? Can it be true?","Date":"17 December 2000","Score":"83 out of 99 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  The great thing about this movie is that it's not scared to walk a dangerous line between two rarely compatible genres - tongue in cheek horror comedy and European art flick. On its simplest level, it's a schlock zombie flick - pandering to the gore fans. But on another level, it has enough thought-provoking material and poetic direction to please the turtle-neck brigade at your local arts and drama society.Director Michael Soavi risked alienating both camps with this approach. After all - do fans of George A. Romero *really* want to see zombies that don't seem all that dangerous? Or hear philosophical dialogue about the blurry line between what is alive and what is dead? And conversely - do the coffee-house beatniks really want their poetic escapism dampened by bullets through nuns eyeballs and flying, biting severed heads in bridal veils??? If you had asked me a year ago I would have said that the mix sounded ridiculous.Now though - I stand corrected.On the side appealing to my sense of aesthetics and intellect - Michael Soavi's direction was wonderful. The screen is alive with wide angles, slo-mo flowing silks and drips of water. Reminiscent of Ridley Scott in his better days in fact. But wait? What's this cutting through the arty farty pretension? A Sam Raimi style track and pan here? A Jean Paul Jeunet style superimposition there? The whole film is an exercise in visual flair. I can only wish that hollywood had more directors of this calibre. On top of this - the screenplay was superbly written. It delivered shock, comedy or deep sentiment with perfect timing. The climax was stunning and left me very quiet throughout the closing credits.On the side appealing to my sense of Hey lads, let's crack open a few beers and watch some chicks get naked and eaten by zombies! I was equally satisfied. The gore and heaving breast content is most adequate. The zombies were brilliantly designed and had distinct personalities. Even in its deeper moments the film always seems to have it's tongue firmly in its cheek and a mischevious gleam in its eye.At various times I was reminded of Evil Dead 2, The Hudsucker Proxy, Bad Taste, City of the lost children, and Zombie flesheaters to name but a few. An unusual mix indeed - but one that somehow works. All said and done, I heartily recommend this movie to anyone willing to try out - just for once - a zombie flick with a brain (pun intended).

Anyone with an open mind and any mind at all should be able to like this film, if not for the bizarre story for Michele Soavi's incredible visual style, the perfect performances by Everett and Lazaro, or just as a plain, good old time.Dellamorte Dellamore begins like a fun B-horror movie telling us of the care-taker of th Buffalora cemetery, Francesco Dellamorte.  In the cemetery some dead people come back to life 7 days after burial, but, Dellamorte isn't too bothered by this, he just takes it as part of his job to put the dead back in the ground, answering his door with a gun in hand, ready to dispense some Grim Reaper-type justice.  But, within the first three minutes we know from the visual complexity of the film that this won't be just any B-horror movie, and within the first ten minutes we get a glimpse of what is to come - a fascinating meditation on the difference (if any) between life and death, a philosophical look at insanity and loneliness, a recurring love story that grows more bizarre with each telling, and eventually a big old representation about how life is just what we make of it.  The dead returning and the whole zombie thing is just a doorway into Dellamorte's world.  Fortunately, it never takes itself too seriously, if it had it would be a dull bore, but thankfully Romoli throws in lots of wit and dark humor (I'd give my life to be dead), and Soavi never lets us get bored with his always moving, floating camera and elaborate but never over-done sets.Everett gives one of the best performances in film history because it is so subtle, he delivers his lines with just the right amount of sarcasm, cynicism, and un-emotionalism (is that a word?) to pull off what was probably an incredibly difficult performance - but he does it perfectly. Francois Hadji-Lazaro, playing Dellamorte's mute and retarded assistant manages to build more of a character with his simple one word vocab of Nyah and his facial expressions than most big over-done actors/actresses in movies now-a-days.  Anna Falchi is mainly there to provide mysteriously beautiful looks, which she does, in all three of her roles and all of her many lives and unlives.  Soavi was the protogé of Italian horror-stylist Dario Argento, but in Dellamorte Dellamore he comes fully into his own with his own bizarre and incredible style.  This isn't just a case of the student copying the teacher, in this case the student might have even surpassed the master.  Ah, if only you could see one movie this life time.

It's actually quite shocking that this came out during a huge depression for horror cinema, because it's easily one of the greatest horror movies I ever saw. Dellamorte Dellamore is a rather strange mix of horror, romance, twisted fairytale and comedy that isn't quite like anything else in cinema; horror or otherwise. The film knows that it's not the usual sort of film, and revels in this fact throughout. Dellamorte Dellamore buys itself a licence do whatever it wants through the fact that it so weird, and therefore no matter what the film throws at you; it's easy to just back and enjoy it. The film is directed by Dario Argento's talented understudy, Michele Soavi and finds an unlikely lead in Rupert Everett. The story follows Everett; the keeper of a cemetery in a small Italian town called Buffalora. He lives there with his assistant; the deformed Gnaghi, but this isn't quite the normal cemetery, however, as here the dead come back to life and it's up the cemetery man to put them back to sleep. When he meets the most beautiful woman he's ever seen in his cemetery, however, it appears that his luck is starting to change.The atmosphere presented in this film is truly brilliant, and one of Dellamorte Dellamore's main assets. A cemetery is always going to present a macabre location for a film's characters to inhabit, but the Gothic design in this film ensures that Buffalora's cemetery is more than the horror film norm. The way that the smoke protrudes from the graves, along with several little special effects that director Michele Soavi has seen fit to implement all help to give the film that unique ambiance that it portrays so well. Soavi has given this film it's own style throughout, and even the zombies adhere to it. Soavi's zombies, like the rest of the film, don't stick to convention and rather than being covered with blood, falling to pieces of screaming brains!, these zombies really look like they've been underground, and also manage to tie in with the downbeat tone of the rest of the movie. A lot of imagination has gone into Dellamorte Dellamore, and almost every sequence is soaked in it. It's things like the way that the cemetery man's assistant takes the mayor's daughter's head from her grave and puts it in the television that makes Dellamorte Dellamore what it is, and not just any other zombie movie.Horror movies aren't known for great acting, but Dellamorte Dellamore breaks convention once again on that front. Rupert Everett puts in a performance that goes over and above what audiences have come to expect from him given his earlier roles. Like the rest of the film, he just fits in; and if you'd never seen Everett in anything before, you would think that he made this kind of movie all the time. The fact that he isn't essentially a horror film actor only makes the performance even more impressive. Anna Falchi stars opposite him in three different female roles, and looks absolutely great in all of them. The rest of the cast is made up of lesser-known actors, with the very odd François Hadji-Lazaro standing out most among them. Director Michele Soavi started out working under the great Dario Argento, but the few films he has directed himself show that he is a bigger talent than his resume lets on. Here, for example, he has created a film that absolutely stands on it's own. Dellamorte Dellamore goes beyond the title 'horror film', and comes out in a sub-genre all of it's own. Films like this don't often come to the attention of the mainstream; and that's a shame because originality like this should be praised to high heaven. Dellamorte Dellamore is a film that is impossible to ignore and, providing you can find a copy, ignoring is definitely not the recommended action!

The story is about lonely cemetery attendant Francesco (Rupert Everett (!?) in one of his very early roles)and his mute, Igor-like assistant Gnaghi. Every seven days, the dead rise from their graves (for no real apparent reason...) and it is Francesco and Gnaghi's job to dispatch them.

Well, this movie - out of an offering of what seemed like hundreds - is the only one that seemed to stick out and grab me, so I rented it. And I'm glad I did, I was NOT disappointed.This movie possesses all those pluses that I like in those movies that I give high marks to. Namely, it is absorbing, thick with atmosphere, adroitly filmed, has great location scenery and expertly designed sets, and has compelling, believable characters who actually make you care about their individual fates as the movie unfolds. Yes, this movie has all that, and it is hard to believe that I found all this in a (gasp!) Italian zombie flick.But it's true, and as you can see from previous comments herein, most other people commenting on this film were also quite impressed with the film.I also like the ending... I will be the first to admit that the ending is as enigmatic and puzzling as many other segments of the film. Perhaps that's why I like the ending it's not a slick, hokey happy-ending sort of finish. And by the way, has anybody else noticed that the ending is a clever variation of the proverbial cliff hanger ending??Anyway, I heartily recommend this movie to anyone who is a horror-zombie-gore-fantasy film lover who wants some quality goods. There is gore aplenty, though I never found it to be disgusting or disturbing. Plus, there are some beguiling and wonderfully sexy scenes featuring that most beautiful model/actress from Finland, Anna Falchi. Rupert Everett is captivating as the title character, and the guy who plays his half-wit assistant Gnaghi is wonderfully expressive - it's hard to believe he barely utters a complete sentence the entire film. Oh, and one more thing... after seeing this film, should the need ever arise, you should be utterly inspired to go out and plug rampaging zombies squarely in the head with dum-dum bullets.

Of course, the words 'Italian horror' and 'character study' are not the kind of stuff you read in the same review. That is what makes this intriguing little film, along with Argento's psychological thriller STENDHAL SYNDROME, one of the last great horror films to come out of Italy. DELLAMORTE DELLAMORE was even given a theatrical release in Uncle Sam's land circa 1996 under the name CEMETERY MAN and it did quite well thanks to Rupert Everett's star power.We know this is going to be something special from the very first scene After the camera zooms out of a skull (very cool effect) we are inside a small room while a young man answers a phone call. Then someone knocks on his door and when he opens it&#133; tcham! A rotten zombie enters the room. The audience is surprised, but the man isn't as he grabs a gun and calmly shoots the thing in the head. He returns to the phone like it was some bizarre daily routine as the camera reveals he lives right by a cemetery. Roll titles.We then learn, through a continuous narration, that the man happens to be Francesco Dellamorte (Rupert Everett) a caretaker of a local cemetery of a small Italian town. Dellamorte is one lonely and unhappy man The entire town makes fun of him for being apparently impotent and having a miserable sex life. Every night, with the help of his mute nerdy assistant Gnaghi (Francois Hadji-Lazaro) he is forced to dispose of the living dead who return from their graves seven days after their burial. This is a major factor of the film that is left unexplained as we are left to assume the zombies exist thanks to an unknown plague. It doesn't even matter anyways, this is the whole set-up of the movie and instead of having a linear plot, Gianni Romoli's sharp script (based on an Italian comic book series) is a string of semi-unconnected events that shape the film as an episodic piece. In fact, one could somehow consider DELLAMORTE DELLAMORE as an anthology film linked together by the characters.Throughout the film's duration, Francesco falls in love with many nameless women (all of them are played by the same actress Anna Falchi) and these affairs usually end in bad consequences. The first woman is recently widowed nymph who is apparently turned on by ossuaries. When her jealous husband comes back to the grave and kills her, Dellamorte is left shocked and hopeless. But fortunately for him she is buried in that exact cemetery and not even death can split them apart. Then he ends up falling to the mayor's secretary who happens to have a strange phobia that forces Dellamorte to give up his manhood for love. Will he do it? And finally there is a strange college girl who ends up being too easy. What is her secret? These affairs end up driving Dellamorte insane until the point where he becomes a serial murderer and gets back at all the town folks that originally made fun of him. But is Dellamorte really committing the murders? Or is it someone else? Are those women real or a product of his imagination? Is his insanity getting out of hand? CEMETERY MAN is so unusual for an Italian horror film, a genre that has been fairly stereotyped over the years as hot-blooded women being chased by schizophrenic, knife-wielding, black-gloved killers. It actually has interesting dialogue, sharp plot, and strong character development. Not only that, but it is filled with black humor that actually works. One of the (many) comedic subplots involves Dellamorte's mute assistant Gnaghi falling in love with the mayor's daughter named Velantina (Fabiana Formica) who is later decapitated at a road accident. Guess to whom Valentine's (talking) zombified head hooks up? The Valentina/Gnaghi subplot is actually a very sweet and funny touch in the film and you actually feel sorry at the tragic outcome. The ridiculous idea of a talking head reminded me of Dario Argento's terrible attempt that same year in TRAUMA where the Italian maestro used it in a serious tone. It all gets more bizarre when Mayor Scanerotti (Stefanio Mascearelli) uses his daughter's death as political propaganda, proving that politicians don't have a soul indeed. During the beginning of the film I thought Detective Straniero's (Mickey Knox) failure at suspecting there was something wrong with Dellamorte was a plot hole when later I realized it was actually being played for laughs. And I laughed. Is CEMETERY MAN parodying the usual narrative problems with Italian horror?The entire movie is revolved around Rupert Everett who is given a lot to do here from the narration to the actual on-screen performance. It is a shame that Everett's performance in this is never mentioned when people talk about his work. In fact, his horrendous role along with Madonna in 1999's NEXT BEST THING gets more recognition. I would go as far as saying Francesco Dellamorte is the strongest role I ever saw Everett play. He nails the character's offbeat sense of humor from the very first scene and seems to play the whole thing dead serious, making us somehow laugh anyway. This is a performance that proves that we can always take an actor's performances seriously, no matter what his/her real-life sexual preference is.Michele Soavi was one of the most enigmatic horror directors to come out of Italy. Being a strong protégé of Dario Argento early on his career, the young gifted director completed many music videos as well as some documentaries and assistant-director credits before making his directorial debut in 1987's STAGFRIGHT. With the international success of that film, Soavi soon became hot stuff and was said being the next carrier of the torch that was originally passed from Mario Bava to Argento, but sadly it wasn't so. After directing four acclaimed films (with CEMETERY MAN being the last) Soavi retired and isolated himself from the movie-making business never to be heard from the international public again. Sad really, one can only imagine what his career would have been like if he kept directing because Cemetery MAN is so well-crafted. Soavi breathes style into the picture that mirrors the work of Mario Bava, Sam Raimi, Tim Burton, Peter Jackson, and others. He is even inspired by Orson Welles at some point and I won't tell you where&#133; The special fx-work was made by Argento regular Sergio Stivaletti (PHENOMENA, SLEEPLESS) and it is one of the most puzzling aspects of the film. For most of the time, the gore looks horribly fake. But one can only guess that was the intention. The zombies look and act so exaggerated and the gore looks so forced and corny one can't help but laugh at it. And were all those visible 'invisible' wires intentional? I am guessing it was just the VHS transfer I watched the film with. Few films manage to be as haunting, imaginative, weird, and even as darkly funny as CEMETERY MAN. If you ignore some weak dubbing (the one problem the Italian horror industry will apparently never get rid of) you will have one great time. From the eyebrow-raising introduction to the enigmatic conclusion, it will be frustrating to know that Michele Soavi wasn't able to save the Italian horror industry from being taken over by Asian horror as the major alternative from Hollywood slasher flicks and now the industry is far from the 70s glory it once had, with Dario Argento managing to come out with a few minor hits over the years.(5/5)  "}{"Title":"Wonderful film.","Date":"5 October 2003","Score":"22 out of 30 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Rupert Everett plays a cemetery caretaker named Francesco Dellamorte.He and his mute sidekick Gnaghi spend most of their evenings shooting zombies in the head,or splitting their skulls in half with the shovel,having to dispatch them again when they tend to rise from the grave after seven days.Rupert falls for a mysterious beautiful young widow(the breathtaking beauty Anna Falchi).After the two of them have sex on her husband's grave,her husband wakes up and takes a bite out of her,sending her to the grave.Cemetery Man is one of the best Italian horror movies ever made.It's so wonderfully stylish that it truly blew me away.There is plenty of gore to satisfy fans of Italian horror.Highly recommended.Michele Soavi is a genius!

By 1994, the extreme gore and apocalyptic visions the genre is famous for were well-established. Michelle Soavi's Cemetery Man shows its disinterest in the tradition of the genre in its opening minutes. After a long pan out of the inside of a skull, Francesco Dellamorte causally, without care, shoots a zombie in the head, paying it little mind. Cememtery Man has zombies in it but is not a zombie movie. Instead, it's a surreal, absurdist voyage into the Freuadian psycho-sexual subconscious of its lead character.Adapted from a novel by Tiziano Sclavi, itself a spin-off of Sclavi's immensely popular Dylan Dog comic, the movie takes a semi-episodic look at the life of Francesco Dellamorte, the caretaker of a cemetery in the small Italian town of Buffalora. The dead buried in the cemetery have a nasty habit of returning to life. However, Francesco's concerns are elsewhere. He worries about loosing his job, keeping the zombie infestation a secret. He wonders if his life has meaning and if he'll ever get out of his dead-end corner of the universe. A plot line slowly forms, revolving around Francesco meeting the woman of his dream, only for her to die, and reappear again. The troubles in Francesco's life pile up, culminating in visions of Death itself, prompting him to murder the dead while they're still living.Soavi loads his film with symbols, layers, and deeper meanings. A first time viewer just has to let the dreamy Cemetery Man wash over them. Repeat viewers are allowed to examine the picture, discerning the purpose behind its images and stories. Francesco has no concern for the dead, apathetically slaying zombies. He has little regard for life either, even before his murder sprees start. He struggles to find meaning in his life, has few friends, and no future. The cemetery becomes his prison, the job and the town around inescapable. The events of the film are representative of his inner turmoil. The ending and snow globe imagery reflect this, showing Francesco as trapped in his own cycle of self-defeat. The script acknowledges that this is the protagonist own fault. Dim-witted Gnagi has no problem assembling the skull puzzle Francesco struggles with.The original Italian title is Dellamorte Dellamore, translating as Of Death, Of Love. The love of Francesco's life is a nameless woman that keeps returning to his life. Credited only as She, the woman sets up her own purpose earlier on, asking the man if she can return. She is represented by billowing scarfs. The title is visually illustrated when her bright red scarf, representing of love, blows onto a pile of skulls. The nameless woman is less a character then another symbol of Francesco's self-inflicted torture. During their graveyard set sex scene, the woman stand behind a statue of a headless angel, the wings behind her. Later, the wings fall off the statue, beside Francesco's feet, marking them both as fallen. The first time She dies in Francesco's arms, he is unable to save her. The second time he lets her rotting zombie chew on him. The third encounter shows his suffering over a woman he barely knows isn't worth the trouble it brings. By her fourth appearance, Francesco has come to actively resent his love, another symbol of his endless frustrations. Love, like death, is never as simple as it's supposes to be.Don't think Cemetery Man is a pretentious study in symbolism. The movie has a darkly comic absurdist streak running through it. This is most evident in Gnagi, Dellamorte's sole friend and companion. The rotund Gnagi resembles Uncle Fester and speaks only one word, a grunting Gna! He grotesquely scarfs spaghetti and mindlessly watches television. He hordes dried up leaves in the same way Francesco hordes old telephone books. Like Stan, he shows his romantic interest in the mayor's daughter by vomiting on her. Despite perishing immediately afterwards in a motorcycle crash, Gnagi still gets to have a relationship with the girl. He removes her zombified head from her glass coffin, serenading her with his violin. The girl('s head) is charmed by the bizarre Gnagi and happily takes up resident in his blasted-out TV. Humor is all over the place in this film, from the oddball motorcycle riding zombie, the girl willing to have her undead boyfriend chew on her, the mid-film absurdist take on Tod Browning's The Unknown, the mayor's morbid political grubbling, to Rupert Everett's sarcastic line readings. For all its melancholy and existential wandering, Cemetery Man is a very funny movie.It's also, visually, quite a beautiful one. Soavi has always been a fantastic visualist but he tops himself here. The cemetery is another world. Torquise balls of swamp fire dance through the air. Fog billows among the grave stones. The gates and walls of the graveyard seem to close in on the characters as the story goes on. The tombs are painted in blues and violets. Soavi places his camera in creative locations. It slides between floorboards, under coffin lids and even peers out of a floating head's mouth. Inside of showing the aftermath of a violent shooting in a simple A-to-B fashion, the camera spins upside down. Cemetery Man is equally moody and creative in story and visual presentation.The ending is inscrutable at first. However, I finally gleamed its meaning on this rewatch. Francesco realizes his greatest treasure had been beside him the whole time and, still unable to escape his own world, devotes himself to his stalwart companion. Rupert Everett is perfectly cast in the lead, Francois Hadji-Lazaro makes one word mean so much, and Anna Falci is achingly desirable. Cemetery Man is a unique, beautiful film, Michele Soavi's masterpiece, a one-of-a-kind treat for adventurous horror fans.

A bunch of stuff happens that seems to be going somewhere... but it never gets there.It's difficult to come up with a full 10 lines of commentary, because this film is such a totally empty experience. There's lots of nice photography of a cemetery, some really lame zombie effects, some flashes of what might pass for surrealist humor, and a feeble, existentialist ending. These elements undermine each other. Just when you might be enjoying the creepy mood, there's some silliness with bouncing heads or zombie sex. To keep from screaming with boredom, you clutch at the minimal story line - and it disintegrates into ridiculous illogic. It's like someone took several half-baked B movies and tossed them in a blender.What comes out is mostly a film *about* meaninglessness - and *not* a good one. Clearly, it will impress that category of art-house fan who sees emptiness as indistinguishable from depth. Everyone else should stay well clear of this dreary mess.

Death has become Francesco Dellamorte's life and is up until the day that he meets her and falls in love.People who watch this and expect a no-brain (no pun intended) zombie flick will most likely be disappointed. The zombie-plot is secondary at most, but a nice touch to the surreal-factor of the movie. In some ways, it has more in common with Lynch-flicks like Lost Highway and Mullholland Dr. One of the similarities is that you should probably watch this movie at least twice.The best description I could come up with for this movie is probably bizarre.

It tries to be erotic, funny, supernatural, and shocking. It certainly succeeds in a very, very strange way, mostly because the film can't ever find a consistent mood, and ends up being a spotty and repetitive black comedy.British actor Rupert Everett has the title role of Francesco Dellamorte (literally Francesco of Death), the Cemetery Man. In Francesco's town of Buffalora, the dead don't stay dead. Seven days after burial, they come back, clawing their way out of their graves, looking for flesh to eat. Francesco has been employed by the local mayor (Stefano Masciarelli) to live in the cemetery and dispatch the zombies before they escape into the community. The only way to eliminate a ghoulish returnee is to destroy its skull. Francesco's favorite weapon is a pistol, but he's not above using any other handy object. The matter-of-fact manner in which he eliminates the zombies provides a source of constant humor.Add to this a series of identical but unrelated beautiful women, a horrific tragedy involving nuns and boy scouts, an unsolved string of murders, ghostly dancing lights, a talking head, political conspiracies, metaphysical dilemmas, Death personified, and some sex for good measure, and you've got the ingredients for a good black horror/comedy. However, the film never takes one theme and builds upon it (in fact, the zombies, numerous in the first hour of the film are surprisingly scarce in the final half-hour).Despite its boldness, Dellamorte Dellamore falls considerably short of being a masterpiece. The film runs out of comic momentum about two-thirds of the way through, and has to lurch and stumble towards the finish line. Soavi can only sustain the humor for so long before it becomes repetitive. It never really ends -- it just stops, and the scenes leading up to the closing credits are easily the movie's weakest. If you left the film twenty minutes early, you wouldn't miss much. And perhaps the biggest shame to the film, is it's complete spoof of the Tod Browning/Lon Chaney horror silent-era classic The Unknown (1927). Though Soavi's film features a strange plot, it simply tries too hard to be different, taking all authenticity away. Dellamorte Dellamore is good, but nowhere near the inspired insanity it strives for.

Everyone keeps coming back to life including the dead husband of a beautiful widow (Anna Falchi) who Dellamorte falls for and seduces on the grave of her husband. When he comes back to life and bites his wife, she dies but also returns, and Dellamorte kills her for a second time.Other comedic characters die and resurrect as their loved ones yearn for their return and necrophilia abounds. Dellamorte must kill them as well to protect the public and do his job. When the Angel of Death warns Dellamorte he should kill the living and not the dead, he dreams of killing seven people in the town square, only to awake and discover he dream was reality. With the death of the town mayor, his daughter already dead, returned, and dead again, the town hires a new mayor with an assistant who is the double for Dellamorte's dead lover. Falling for her, he discovers that she can only love an impotent man, and he obliges by chemical castration. When the girl (Anna Falachi's second role) is raped by the mayor, she discovers she likes sex and opts of marry the potent mayor instead. Drowning his sorrows, Dellamorte meets two beautiful students, who ask for a ride home. Laura (Anna Falachi in a third role) seduces him only to reveal that the girls are prostitutes who charge Dellamorte for the roll in the sack. Taking revenge by burning the house and women to death and their house down, Dellamorte swears off love for the third and last time. However, when the police chief arrests Dellamorte's friend for the murder, he goes to the hospital and a killing spree.Throughout the film, themes of love vs. infidelity, life and death, caring and indifference, and ultimately, the difference between life and death raise questions which puzzle the accepting Dellamorte. Frustrated and unfulfilled, Dellamorte and his comic sidekick, Gnoghi, pack up and leave town to experience the rest of the world. The ending is a philosophical treatise that may have some audiences disappointed, but definitely, the twist is unexpected.Verging on absurdity, this film is a European and Italian approach, its look and attempts at ghoul humor and costuming are not the caliber of what American audiences expect. Filled with lots of views of Rupert Everett's beautiful body, it is also more sexual than horrific. If discourses on the ultimate meaning of life, love, and death wrapped in sexual ghoul escapades is not your favorite way to spend the evening, this film might be skipped. However, as an early film with the excellent Rupert in fine form, it is enjoyable entertainment and might be a film for you.

Escpecially when it is just some greaser. Was his family wealthy and this was just implied in ways that I was not able to comprehend (due to my limited cultural exposure)? Cutting off the head of the mayor's daughter and putting it in his TV was a great idea. However, I have yet to figure out how it ~walked~ from the grave to Gnaghi's room.And what the heck was going on when Franco took credit for Franscesco's murders. What was the motivation? Once Franscesco started blowing folks away in Franco's room, I was completely lost.When Marshall Straniero is running up the stairs to find the mad shooter and sees Franscesco's gun, his reaction defies all logic.Is all of this merely to point out how impotent (in the medical sense as well as his ambition and drive) everyone saw him? He yells out, It was me! but nobody cares? Not even the policeman? Not even for a second? Obviously we are traveling in strange places not populated by normal human beings.The feeling was of course completely confirmed by the suitably un-American and bizarre ending in which Francesco discovers that their little town is the entire world as far as they are concerned and Gnaghi and Franscesco seemingly switch abilities with Gnaghi regaining his senses (thanks, blow to the head!) and Franscesco losing his.The defining moment for me was when Francesco realized that his dream woman was ~alive~ when he shot her in the side of the head in the ossuary. Thus began his slide into madness. It was an extremely poignant and moving moment; the viewer is able to feel the conflicting emotions for Francesco anger over Gnaghi sticking a sharpened shovel in her head, anger over himself for realizing that she wouldn't return twice and that she was, in fact, still alive after her dead husband's bite, anger at himself for almost surrendering himself to her as a returner.The movie was very entertaining and I might even watch it again to see if I missed anything.Is that the true mark of a movie's worth? The fact that people want to watch it over and over to try and understand itWhen the credits rolled and the movie was over, I felt sadness; not at the fact that it was over, but at how Francesco's life was turning out.To destroy the woman you love and then lose her two more times (although, he probably had a chance with the last incarnation if he had tried instead of incinerating her -- to him, the point was it wasn't the first one; it wasn't the widow). Gah! To have loved and lost is the greatest pain a man can carry with him. Wounds that never heal but burst out again and again when you least expect it.That is what the movie means to me.

Yeah, it has zombies, but it also has a genuine love story, a sympathetic antihero, an engaging storyline, a random killing spree, and a great ending, all wrapped up into a nice little package. Michele Soavi gives us one of the most original and thought-provoking horror movies of the 90's.Rupert Everett gives a superb performance as the tortured caretaker Francesco, who goes through life day by day, burying people and killing the occasional 'returner.' He knows that there's nothing worth living for, since 'everyone ends up here eventually.' The performances are excellent from the other relatively unknown actors, most notably the characters of Gnaghi and She. Gnaghi (na-gee) is great as Francesco's sidekick / helper. He only says one word, but manages to be a funny and likable character. The character of She represents how evil women can be and plays three different characters that break Francesco's heart. Claudio, The Mayor, and his daughter do a good job, along with everyone else.This movie is a very interesting way to look at both love and death. Here they are interconnected because every time a character finds love, death follows close behind in one form or another. There cannot be love without death. It can be interpreted either positively, that in order to love, death must be a part of one's life, or negatively, that love is evil and should be taken care of with death. You figure out how you want to interpret it.The movie also has many things that are completely irrelevant to the plot, but are entertaining and effective nonetheless. There are blue flying orbs that zoom around the cemetery. Francesco goes on a violent killing spree, only to have the credit taken by someone else. Death manifests itself in a cemetery statue every now and then to talk to Francesco. The film is filled with macabre humor as well, which is very enjoyable. These things have no real point, but make for a great addition to the movie.The gore and special effects are well done. Being the protégé of Dario Argento, Soavi injects the film with visually stunning imagery and over-the-top violence. All of the scenes in the cemetery at night are eerie, as well as the scene in the ossuary. There are some excellent moments of gore, especially when a group of teens on motorcycles get squished by a bus (one of which later reanimates complete with a 'death cycle'). There are also some bloody headshots and a nasty split head. Gorehounds will not be disappointed.I also have to mention the ending. I really thought it was a very clever way to end the film. Most people shrug it off because it doesn't make much sense, but I loved it. Great job Soavi!The Bottom Line A very entertaining, thought-provoking film that mixes zombies with a twisted love story.

So the line blurs...His life seems an invention of extreme metaphor -it's ultimately pure solipsism - surreally symbolic, passive; even when he seems that he should be held accountable, he slips through the most obvious cracks of rationale. He's an invisible man - the product of a union between love and death- he tries to reconcile the two, even in a world that seems real, unless it's a fishbowl existence he quite possibly constructed as a means of fathoming the meaning of his place in life. He suffers, he lashes back with obvious evidence, yet no accountability. While the film is never overt in its symbolism, it examines its protagonist via his hall-of-mirrors perspectives of love and death. You will never see this done in such an existential, yet eerily poignant manner.

Francesco, then meets a woman who comes to the cemetery often to visit her late husband and soon she falls in love with Francesco. Things get complicated after they have sex on her husband's grave and he comes back to life and she dies of shock. The rest of the movie includes other very unusual things including Francesco meeting other women who look exactly the same as the woman from the cemetery and his partner Gnaghi, falling in love with the decapitated head of a local town girl. Winner of The Silver Scream Award for director Michele Soavi at The Amsterdam Fantastic Film Festival, The David Award for Best Production Design at The David di Donatello Awards, The International Fantasy Film Award for Best Actor (Rupert Everett, who plays Francesco) at The Fantasporto Awards, The Audience Award for Michele Soavi at The Gerardmer Film Festival and The Best Actor Award at The Malaga International Week of Fantastic Cinema. Cemetery Man, has good direction, a good script, good performances from everybody involved, good original music, good production design and good makeup and special effects. The film is low budget and is amaturely done but I enjoyed it. The film is a little slow moving and it is filled with dry and dark humour which for the most part works and the film is a well made film and is quite smart and original. I also liked the way the film looked and film dreamlike and like we are watching someone's dream or a nightmare. The film comes up with clever twists and never gets boring and the last half hour is a real mind twister which I didn't totally understand but I liked it all the same. A very original and interesting horror film that also works as a dark comedy and works well.

It 's not just another empty hack & slash movie with no heart. No, there's clever dialogue and good performances here. For example, the relationship between Dellamorte and his faithful assistant Naghi is both touching and quite funny.Visually, the film is outstanding. The moody, surreal gothic sets really enhance the fright factor of the movie. There is also some neat camera work that invokes a few WOW's. There are however a few scenes that are hard to watch that, ironically, don't even involve the zombies (ex Naghi throwing up on the Mayor's daughter).  Overall though, this movie is FUN! I mean, c'mon the subject matter is about a cemetary caretaker killing zombies - is this something we encounter in our daily lives? Probably not. So why not make it stylish and funny and something our brains can appreciate - even in it's absurdity.Go rent the movie. Show it to your friends - they'll recognize that guy from My Best Friend's Wedding (Rupert Everett)and say, I never heard about this movie before - it's pretty cool.

Horror-wise this movie also has little to offer, with the exception of a couple of moments. Overall it's just a below average and forgettable genre movie to watch.I like Italian horror and Giallo movies, even when the movie itself is being quite simplistic. Then why didn't I like this one?

The movie its atmosphere was also far too dark, in my opinion. Even the daylight scenes are dark looking and at night you can hardly see what's happening.Funny thing that this movie stars Rupert Everett, who only became a popular actor in recent years.

Its a rare thing to find a movie which uses bats on visible strings and makes allusions to paintings by Rene Margritte(the kiss in the crypt resembles Margritte's The Lovers), and have talking zombie heads, but here it is-and in English. Rupert Everertt delivers a great performance as the caretaker for a cemetery in a small Italian village, where the dead once buried there come back to life, and every evening without fail, he kills them and buries them again. Of course no one will listen to him, and killing the zombies becomes more a matter of maintenance than survival. Against this backdrop of casual zombie killing, comes a love interest, into our protagonists life, a beautiful woman who will appear and then die, and then appear again, rising like the dead from cemetery. And speaking of things which rise from the grave, our hero is completely impotent, a fact everyone in town knows and taunts him about. The film goes on to subtly discuss, death, love, sex, bureaucracy, divisions of labor, obsession, reality, and the literal ends of the earth. There's also plenty of zombie gore, sex, vomit, and decapitated heads. This movie is too smart for most of the zombie crowd, and has too much projectile vomit for much of the art house fans, but then there are those for whom this film will be just right. Not to mention Micheal Savoi's direction, which is as good as Gilliam or Ridley Scott in his technical Blade Runner days. Every shot is framed to give it a sense of visual flourish, and it's a shame Savoi never made anything nearly this ambitious again. The story is based on an Italian comic book called Dylan Dogg(which hasn't been translated, into English yet, but of which I've heard great things.), and Cemetary Man is it's American release title, originally it was Dellamorte Dellamore which means roughly Of Love, Of Death and is a play on words as our heroe's fathers last name Dellamorte, while his mothers was Dellamore. A fascinating, funny, gory, smart, mindf*&k of a film, that should be seen by all fans of zombie movies, tricky cinematography, art films, and movies in general. Up there with Dawn Of The Dead, and Dead Alive, this stands as on an essential, if unknown part of the Zombie cannon, this is about as close it's come to literature.

For one, it takes place somewhere in England and it is also filmed in English. To that point, one can't really tell that it really is Italian horror, except for that signature Italian class that lightly coats the film (like Suspiria or Opera). However, it was directed by an Italian filmmaker, Michele Soavi, who is known to be associated with the likes of Fulci and Argento. It stars Rupert Everett and the super-gorgeous Anna Falchi. And it has zombies. And a love story. And a fat retarded guy.Rupert Everett is the caretaker of a cemetery and the local mortician. His cemetery has a problem Corpses tend to return from the dead seven days after dying. So he doesn't get much sleep as he and his bumbling retarded counterpart spend a lot of nights fighting off zombies. Early on, an old geezer dies and his sexy wife (Falchi) attends the funeral where Rupert Everett sees her and falls madly in love with her. Of course, when he finally talks to her and starts having sex with her, her husband returns and bad times are had by all. Believe it or not, a big chunk of this film is Rupert Everett dealing with trying to find love and humorously, he meets three women who all look like his dream goddess (Falchi again), who all in one way or another end up breaking his heart. On top of this, there are countless people dying in this humble burg and a great many zombies to deal with (many are Boy Scouts from a bus crash). Then, as if there wasn't already enough going on, Rupert Everett starts talking to Death and then he goes nuts. This movie is totally packed with weird content! And the best part is It's all wonderfully entertaining! The acting is actually done really well,with a good deal of class thrown in. The zombies look decent and are pretty entertaining and Anna Falchi looks hot, on top of which, she is nude for a cemetery sex scene which is very amusing. The film has an artistic flair to it and the atmosphere is actually very appropriate to a horror film, which is a fantastic point since there is so much going on that could have detracted from the atmosphere in a lesser film. The story is the highlight here as it doesn't really have twists and turns so much as it's filled with weirdness and surprises as well as some truly entertaining characters. You can't help but laugh the third time you see Anna Falchi show up as a different character, or when the retarded guy vomits on the mayor's daughter. Overall, it's a charming horror film that never fails to entertain. The weirdness and abstract nature of the film continues to build right to the head-scratching ending. About the only problems with Cemetery Man are that is seems to drag on with no actual ending in sight at a few points (because the story is so weird and the film is roughly two hours long) and there are some truly cheap special effects with spirits in the cemetery. They're balls of fire hung on string. And the strings are very visible. Otherwise, it's highly recommended to fans of horror and weirdness.8/10 "},{"Title":"the ultimate zomromcom!","Date":"29 August 2007","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" I know this is hard for you!

When I first watched this movie I thought it was a horror and was disappointed to find it was more of a comedy. I continued to watch and found myself laughing so hard at the stuff going on and then went on to find that I was seeing a deeper meaning to this movie. So by the time I finished there was absolutely no reason to be disappointed.I think we all can relate to this if you think about it, who doesn't feel trapped in a world where we seem to be keeping the dead (the past) hidden and in its place.

Can we really ever escape, do we want those around us to find a life or happiness unless we can as well.Horror fans, comedy fans and those who love romantic dramas all should go now and get this movie and watch it at least once a year - it really is that great.The cast is awesome, how could anyone not enjoy Rupert Everette - He shines on camera. The direction is almost a character within itself and adds so much, the imagery in the sets especially the graveyard is among the best I have ever seen.

The guy who Argento taught everything he knows too. In 1994 Soavi directed Dellamorte Dellamore (Cemetery Man) yet another entry into the horror genre. But this wasn't your standard zombie gore fest. This movie had a little more going for it, what was it? Oh yeah, some freaking originality! Story is about this guy named Francesco Dellamorte who works as a caretaker at the local cemetery. There, day in and day out he is in charge of burying the dead and sending them of to the afterlife. Only problem is that in this cemetery the dead rise after seven days of being dead! Soon Francesco finds himself knee deep in zombies! Weird thing is he treats everything very matter of factly and just kills the zombies and continues with his life. That is until he meets an extremely gorgeous woman in a burial. He immediately falls for her. It seems Francescos life will not only revolve around death this time because apparently love is just around the corner for this grave digger.One of the things I admire most about this movie is its atmosphere. The location where they chose to shoot the film was fantastic and beautiful. And the few scenes that were shot on the real cemetery add a level of reality to the proceedings, this wasn't an obvious set. This cemetery looked real, filled with real graves and awesome Gothic statues. Rupert Everett is a real asset to this film. I cannot imagine anyone else playing Francesco Dellamorte, its his role and no one elses. He dominates the screen as a guy who has gotten so used to living amongst the dead, that he actually prefers it. He prefers living amongst the dead and the undead, for they don't pester him as much as live humans do. I also dug Francois Hadji as Gnagi, Francescos assistant and best friend. He is a cartoon of a character, sometimes retarded, sometimes funny and most of the time just gross to look at. Then there's Anna Falchi as she. The girl of Francescos dreams. And to be quite honest I don't blame him. This girl is hotter then Georgia Asphalt! She is the girl grieving over her husbands recent death, and soon she becomes the object of Francescos affections. Man, this movie has some steamy sex scenes! Lots of boob and ass shots here for both the girls and guys and from the guys side Ill say this You wont be disappointed! Of course the movie (I'm sad to say) does have a few flaws here and there. Technical difficulties were present for example, there's a scene in which Francescos making out with the girl on top of a grave and some ghostly lights appear next to them. They are little balls of blue flame floating around, now this is a very cool idea that I loved immensely, but I was so distracted by the fact that you could see the strings that were holding the little light balls up in the air. I really hated that and wished they'd taken a little extra care so that those strings wouldn't show up on screen. Same thing goes for a scene in which a fly is hovering above a corpse. The strings holding the fake fly were obviously visible through out the whole thing. But thats about as far as I go when it comes to faults on this movie. The zombies were excellent looking and very different here. The gore was great too and not as plentiful as one might expect from an Italian horror production, but it was there.The movie also has a pretty big fault because it doesn't do a good job of explaining certain plot points. This is extremely common place in Italian horror films and it happens yet again on this film. At certain point in the film you feel like something is not quite right, and according to what I've read of the movie certain things are happening, but it isn't explained in a matter that one would understand. I only became aware of certain plot points after having read explanations about the plot. But I can honestly tell you that from your first watch, you might not catch certain things that are happening. In a way I liked the fact that I didn't fully understand every single little detail, but I'm sure that if the movie had done a better job of explaining certain things it would have been that much cooler. Still, its like a little puzzle that you'll have to figure out if you really want to. Let me put it this way, you can watch the film and take the story exactly for what is happening literally, but when you read about what was really happening in the film you gooooooh I see! And then you get all the little hints that the movie gives you all through out.So in conclusion, Dellamorte Dellamore is a fantastic film from Michele Soavi. I only wish he would make more horror movies. Sadly it seems he has retired from directing straight horror films. Still, Dellamorte Dellamore is his crowning achievement and shouldn't be missed by horror fans just because its a foreign film. Its a movie that talks a lot about death and love as the title so appropriately suggests. This film has many original ideas not seen on other horror films before, its artsy, its surrealistic and dreamlike, its beautiful to look at. In short, I freaking loved it!

Cemetery Man or Dellamorte Dellamore is a movie that also reinvented the modern zombie movie. Like Shaun of the Dead, Cemetery Man brings together romance, comedy and horror successfully. However unlike Shaun of the Dead, Cemetery Man focuses on the dark humor, which is very well portrayed by Rupert Everette as a very cynical Francesco Dellamorte or Frances of Death. The original title of the movie Dellamorte Dellamore pretty much sums up the entire movie, on the one hand he is Francesco Dellamorte, the bringer of death to both the undead and later the living, on the other hand he can be Francesco Dellamore or Frances of Love in the fact that he is truly searching for his love and because of the situations in which he is trying to find his love he becomes the bringer of death. During the movie he is struggling between the two versions of himself only in the end to find that the two go one in hand. Needless to say that this is a very daring movie in that it touches ground that no movie has ever touched before (or at least not to the extent that this movie has). Not to say that the entire movie is about love and death. This film also strives to show different ways in which the world is perceived by different people. Such as the mayor having his own daughter's grave dug up so he can take pictures of himself with his daughter's corpse for an election campaign. Sure there are some events in the movie that are ludicrous to say the least, it was done to show a point and in the end the point was represented very well. This is a movie that everyone should see, even if you're not into zombie movies, just because of the fact that after the movie finishes you won't be able to just shrug it off. This is a movie that sticks with you and makes you think about the world around you. I should have known it. The rest of the world doesn't exist.

Luckily it seems to have deeper layers to explore and only in that and some of the visuals is it worth seeing. I just hope the writers intended the deeper meanings and I'm not seeing what was never meant to be there. My initial thoughts while watching this film were that Dellamorte's experiences were different guises of what humans experience as love. For instance the all consuming love of the teenager infatuated with the dead motorcycle guy. She couldn't deal with the thought that he may have loved another woman and not her. These feeling were manifested in her being literally eaten alive by his zombie self and her accepting it as her fate in order to please him. There were crimes that were committed and not blamed on Dellamorte. As if no one could come to grips with the fact that love can kill, especially scorned love or rejected love. Instead the inspector looks for another killer, because Dellamorte (who represents the focal point of love here) could not possibly be the killer even if all evidence points to him. Dellamorte even gets angry that his murders are being stolen from him. Nobody can see love as the killer or at least nobody wants to see love that way. In the first incarnation of She (Anna Falchi) we see what is probably Dellamorte's first real encounter with love/Sex. His first is a woman who shares his obsessions with death and uses it to bring out their passion. But this sort of passionate first love is fleeting and can't last it will eventually burn out and usually does quickly. The emotional specter of her own passionate first lover is there to haunt them and literally rises from the grave to kill her. Then there was the love that a man might feel is emasculating and a folly. This is shown by the second incarnation of She (Anna Falchi). Dellamorte is willing to cut off his genitals for her because the thought of making love is so frightening to her. His reward later is to find she has fallen for another man. This after driving him to try and commit the ultimate act to retain her love. He was willing to make this extreme sacrifice for her, ruining any possibility of other lovers for him. But instead of loving him back she falls for the man who abused and raped her. He was emasculated in two ways physically and mentally by her actions. Luckily thanks to the Doc one was only temporary. Or there was the guise of love that is really only greed. In the third incarnation of She, Dellamorte wishes to hear her say she loves him when they first meet. She does so to please him and then supplies him with a night of passion and joy, but not without a price. In the morning he finds that it's time to pay for her love with money. I believe there was one scene where Dellamote even said that his mother's name meant Love and how ironic that was to him. Of course I have only scratched the surface here trying to explain my reasoning. I think others who have seen the film may find other examples of the role the faces of love plays in the story. It's worth seeing if you take it at more than it's face value as a zombie film only.

But this flick became a classic due the gore attached and the effects who looked stunning done by Sergio Stivaletti (did a lot of Italian gore flicks). The crash with the bus and the motorcycle is the real stuff. But it's also famous for the reason that Dellamorte mostly falls in love with the death and the people visiting the cemetery. Most notorious is the love scene with Valentina (Fabiana Formica) in her first role ever making it out on a grave both in full nudity. For me this isn't a classic, but I agree that the effects alone are worth watching.

His job is to keep the dead people who rise from their graves in the cemetery. He's not sure exactly why, or why they come back, but it doesn't really bother him. He's got other concerns, like his constant philosophical musings on life. His best sentence in the film is, The living dead and the dying living. Cut from the same cloth.His cohort in this is Gnaghi, a fat, bumbling, Three Stooges type who answers in one word grunts and lives in the basement watching old war footage all day long. That may sound weird, but Dellamorte spends his time reading phone books.Anna Falchi shows up at her husband's funeral, and later as a hooker, and also as the mayor's assistant. The whole time Dellamorte is in love with her, but isn't sure if she's real, or imaginary, dead or alive.The Grim Reaper also makes an appearance, telling Dellamorte to stop killing the dead, and kill the living before they become dead. Makes sense, in a mortifyingly simple way.In the end, Dellamorte and Gnaghi decide it's time to escape the town. How that goes is up to you to find out, because I seriously don't want to ruin this movie for you. It's funny, touching, thought provoking, disgusting and clever, all rolled into one. If you can find this movie, absolutely watch it. It's well worth every minute. _____________For all the Horror Banana reviews, visit http//morozov924.hubpages.com/ "},{"Title":"Gravely Unconventional","Date":"10 November 2012","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" This plays as if Argento, Kafka, Dali, Leone and Romero went to the pub one night, got hammered on absinthe and collectively said You know what would be a good idea for a film...? CEMETERY MAN is an Italian black comedy zombie flick that effortlessly succeeds at being weird, bizarre, unconventional, erotic and generally unnerving throughout. It is at times crass and gross, arty and visually sensual, confusing and uneven. But it remains consistently quite compelling and utterly impossible to pigeonhole.Rupert Everett plays the caretaker of a provincial cemetery where the dead come to life and it's his job to put them back in the ground by delivering extreme head trauma with bullet, blade and blunt instrument. Add three women in his life, played by the same actress but apparently different characters, a semi-mute and mentally deficient assistant who is in love with a talking severed head in a bridal veil, a dumb and clueless cop, a gang of biker delinquents, serial murder and the grim reaper himself. Then chuck in some metaphysical philosophy on the nature of existence and what constitutes the world, life and death, along with a dash of surrealism, a pinch of necrophilia and a large dose of graphic violence and gore and there you have it. Or there you don't exactly, because these elements only scratch the surface without touching upon the multiple undercurrents, plot threads and shrouded meanings running beneath.It was a financial failure and critically ill-received on release. Prime cult fodder, then, and that status gave it a reputation and saved it from obscurity. Whether you enjoy it or not is in the lap of the gods. I can imagine a lot of people had their expectations subverted because without some foreknowledge it isn't going to be what most would expect. The wide-open-to-interpretation ending will please some and confound others. If you are on the lookout for something twisted, off key and original, give it a shot. Just don't expect a conventional zombie-fest. "},{"Title":"Suffered in the United States from poor marketing.

Yes, we do get our primitive desire to see zombie carnage (and then some) fulfilled but we also get something to think about.See this film if you are in the mood for a zombie flick but would also like something that offers a lot more substance than anything by Fulci and most Romero films post-1978.

A beautiful widow (seriously, Anna Falchi is stunning in this and fortunately you get to see a lot of her) interrupts the duo's nightly routine of headshots and re-burial, and things quickly get even weirder. Cemetery Man is campy at times, there's lots of old school gore, black humor, murder sprees, a supernatural reoccurring love story, odd characters and shifts in tone (the first half is VERY different from the latter half).

Additionally the cinematography is exceptional - heavily indebted to the Italian horror school - which makes the film hit even harder into memory. This is also a coming of age movie for Dario Argento's protegee, Michele Soavi.A very underrated movie which requires rewatching to fully catch the drift of the movie.

Michele Soavi's masterpiece shows that he was paying attention as Argento's understudy, maybe even surpassing the master. With so many genres rolled into one, this flick's originality allows its occasional zaniness to be smoothly taken in stride. With an almost whimsical plot, it conveys a meaning, or maybe purpose, of death that is felt more than it is understood. This fascination with death is furthered through its illicit eroticism. Rupert Everett's acting was sublime, with a subtle sense of delivery that is masterful. His nearly mute sidekick was equally wonderful. Anna Falchi's presence is a blessing that will send most guys to church, begging for more. Michele Soavi's direction was simply perfect, and the stylish camera work was delivered with an unequaled flair. The production set was both low budget and incongruently elaborate. Like any meditation of death, this goes beyond a mortal's capacity of comprehension, making for a movie that would be appreciated by horror fans and the intelligentsia alike.

That's all there is to say about this film! If there is one Horror film from the 90s that every (true) genre-lover must see, it is probably Dellamorte Dellamore. Dario Argento-protégé Michele Soavi had previously shown his great talent and affection for the Horror genre with films like Deliria (aka. Stage Fright, 1987), La Chiesa (aka. Cathedral of Demons, 1989) and La Setta (aka. The Sect, 1991). It is his incomparable 1994 Zombie flick Dellamorte Dellamore, however, that is his undisputed masterpiece. Seriously, Dellamorte Dellamore is one of the most memorable, if not The most memorable Horror film from the (poor) decade of the 90s, and arguably the greatest satirical Horror film since Stuart Gordon's Re-Animator. Soavi proves a rare talent to create a creepy and intense atmosphere and mix it with incredibly hilarious black humor, interesting characters and a weird and original storyline that has yet to find an equal.The film's protagonist, Francesco Dellamorte (Rupert Everett) is the cemetery keeper of the small Italian town Buffalora. The dead in this particular cemetery, however, don't stay dead, and, along with his mentally retarded sidekick Gnagi (François Hadji-Lazaro), Dellamorte is busy keeping the dead the way they are supposed to be - dead. Things get more complicated when Dellamorte falls in love with a beautiful widow (Anna Falchi)...Simply stated, Dellamorte Dellamore has everything - an incredible setting and wonderfully morbid atmosphere, bizarre but very likable characters and excellent performances, a respectable dose of gore and incredibly hilarious and irresistibly macabre black humor. Rupert Everett delivers a terrific performance in a role that fits him like a glove - seriously, I could not imagine anybody else being more predestined for this role. Equally great is François Hadji-Lazaro, who is extremely odd and equally funny in the role of Gnagi, the bizarre, yet incredibly likable sidekick whose mental handicaps are the least of his problems. The stunningly beautiful Anna Falchi, who plays Dellamorte's love interest, makes a wonderful and incredibly sexy female lead. It must be said that Dellamorte Dellamore is a film that cannot quite be compared to anything else. There are probably as many humorous Zombie films by now as there are serious ones, but none other can compare with the ingenuity of this brilliantly interlaced film. The film is incredibly morbid, and incredibly hilarious in its morbidity. Its protagonists are some of the most lovable characters ever in Horror cinema. The cemetery and the small Northern Italian town are an incredible setting for the brilliantly convoluted and unique story of this film. Director Soavi manages to create an incomparable atmosphere, the gore-effects are sublimely done yet funny, and go perfectly in hand with the film's bizarre (and awesome) sense of humor. The brilliant score is just another ingenious and intensifying aspect of the film. This is one of these films that can be watched countless times and only get better with each viewing. I have personally seen it about ten times by now, and I will continue to watch it on many many more occasions. In my humble opinion, Dellamorte Dellamore is the greatest Horror film of the 90s and one of the greatest Horror-Comedies ever. And it is also a Romance. And a wonderful film about friendship. For a Horror lover, this simply is one of the most outrageously entertaining films to see, and it cannot quite be compared to anything else. A true must!

Without warning, seven days after burial, the inhabitants have a penchant for waking up from their dirt naps and a taking a stroll for a midnight snack...which means anyone unlucky enough to be around them could be dinner! The responsibility of putting these hungry zombies back to bed for good has fallen to the engineer - a.k.a. the watchman of Buffalora Cemetery, one Francesco Dellamorte (Rupert Everett). The resurrections have now become so commonplace for him, that he just thinks of it as another chore. Water the flowers, repair broken headstones, shoot some zombies in the head and rebury them...you know; just another night on the job. Dellamorte is aided in his tasks by his faithful (if slovenly) assistant, Gnaghi (Francois Hadji-Lazaro), who is kind of like a human lapdog. Both of them live out their days and nights in the watchman's cottage on the cemetery grounds, and the people of Buffalora gossip about them endlessly; one vicious and popular rumor concerns Francesco's...EQUIPMENT, and how he's been living with the dead so long, that his libido and his manhood is pretty much just as 'dearly departed.' Maybe in a way, he even believed that himself. But one day, a gorgeous widow (Anna Falchi) comes in to Buffalora Cemetery to bury her elderly husband, and for Francesco Dellamorte, nothing will ever be the same again...Based on a character created by novelist and graphic novel author Tiziano Sclavi, CEMETERY MAN started life when Francesco Dellamorte made a guest appearance in Sclavi's wildly popular series, Dylan Dog. Supposedly a one-shot deal, Dellamorte's character took on a life of his own and gained such a following, that Sclavi wrote a novel just for him called Dellamorte Dellamore (CEMETARY MAN'S original title). In one of those great coincidences that produce amazing movies, former Dario Argento protégé and director Michele Soavi (THE CHURCH) and writer/producer Gianni Romoli both read Sclavi's novel and the Dylan Dog books, and became interested in producing a film around Dellamorte.And what a film it is! Made over a decade before SHAUN OF THE DEAD, this has something for everybody much in the same vein as that film romance, explicit gore, black humor AND lots and lots of zombies! YUMMMM!!! Head-splittin' good!Rupert Everett, whose expressive face actually inspired the look of Dylan Dog, gives what is probably one of his best performances as the brooding and at times bewildered Francesco. Surrounded by death and the supernatural goings-on in the cemetery he looks after, he never expects to find love in a place where death lives, and as the two become more and more intertwined, it becomes apparent that separating fantasy and reality is just as difficult as resolving which pain is worse the pain of losing your mind, or your heart. It's a beautiful twist on the rom-com roles he would later become known for in movies like MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING and THE NEXT BEST THING.French musician Francois Hadji-Lazaro is great as Gnaghi, who looks a little bit like Curly Howard from The Three Stooges, (which was probably intentional), and certainly has a lot of those qualities as Everett's sidekick and comedy relief, amongst all the 'romantic carnage.' It's even a bit of a surprise when Gnaghi himself finds a little romance (but to say more would be spoiling the fun!)And last but definitely not least is the luminous Anna Falchi as The Woman who comes into Francesco's life. She appeared before in several genre projects made in Italy, the most notable of which is Lamberto Bava's DEMONS, (a film that Michele Soavi worked on as Assistant Director). Although her acting probably won't be the main thing viewers will remember her for, (since she has a lovely body and spends a LOT of time showing it off to Dellamorte), she gives a more than adequate performance, and you can see how and why she could be the woman whom Francesco is unable to forget or escape from as she haunts his increasingly weird existence.Soavi, (in his interview in the Featured Extras) mentioned that the three greatest influences in his creative life are his mentors Dario Argento and Aristide Massaccesi (a.k.a. Joe D'Amato), and Terry Gilliam. Their influence can be seen in the way that he shot and directed CEMETERY MAN. Alternating between stylish and silly, sad and downright scary, it won't be a movie to everyone's liking, but it certainly isn't like anything else you've seen to date...Even SHAUN OF THE DEAD, the movie that most resembles it, is almost completely different in tone, style and sense of pitch-black humor.If you haven't seen this one, I definitely give it a strong recommendation. Anchor Bay did their usual fantastic job with a wonderfully remastered print, and as a big plus included the aforementioned interview (in Italian with subtitles!) with director Soavi, writer/producer Gianni Romoli and the Italian Rick Baker, special effects wizard Sergio Stivaletti (PHENOMENA).

It is therefore an artsy drama with a liberal smattering of bad poetry and half-baked epistemological banter.It is also the story of two men who must constantly battle the zombies that their cemetery produces, and who sometimes confuse the living with the dead. The gore is entirely over-the-top and ridiculous, the zombie make-up is, at best, mediocre, and there really are no special effects to speak of. It is therefore a horror-comedy.Both men fall in love and, because of their disturbing situation and role in life, tragically lose their loved-ones, repeatedly. It is therefore a romance and a tragedy.The sets, architecture, landscapes and many of the scenes in Cemetery Man are straight out of a child's story-book. With an aesthetic reminiscent of Snow White or Tales from the Crypt, it is therefore a fantasy.The big question for Francesco and Gnaghi is - can they escape their cemetery and what will they find if they do? Every minor twist in the story, in one way or another centers on this, though the significance of the question remains hidden throughout most of the film.What is brilliant about Cemetery Man is the fact that the film becomes increasingly unbelievable, increasingly soul-less and increasingly ambiguous for a reason, and as its audience begins to sense the underlying logic of this illogic, the film becomes inexplicably engaging. Unfortunately the film takes its time getting there, relying on the zombie cliché, pretentious voice-over, and occasional gratuitous nude scenes to retain its audience. It is also marred by a few weak performances - though it is possible that some of the apparently poor acting was intentional given the film's intentional detachment from reality.The film's tendency to wander from one genre to another and its focus on a predicament as opposed to a storyline sometimes adversely affects its entertainment value. To truly appreciate the film, you should be wide-awake.As many others have pointed out, the film targets the art house crowd. It does not succeed as a horror film alone, but I would recommend it to horror fans simply because of its uniqueness within that genre. If you enjoyed Michael Cohn's Snow White, Rob Zombie's House of a Thousand Corpses and/or the original Night of the Living Dead, you are likely to enjoy this film's artistic achievement. As an art film, it is successful and recommended.Acting - mostly OK. Cinematography - wonderful. Directing - good, but the film does suffer from pacing problems.

The picture offers much in the way of strangeness (those ignis fatuus floaters, and Gnaghi's romance with a severed female head), comedy (I love the line She was the most beautiful living woman I have ever seen) and mystery (why does the actress Anna Falchi--still a stunner, as a modern-day interview reveals--appear as three different women, and what does that existential, cliffside ending mean?). Rupert Everett and Francois Hadji-Lazaro are just perfect as Francesco and Gnaghi, and yes, the entire film is something of a gas; a genuine cult item if ever there were one.

Cemetery Man was made in 1994, but looks like it was made in 1984. It's got that particular quality that seems impossible to replicate outside of the 80's. Maybe it was the film stock they used back in the day. Technology has gotten too good in Hollywood, so that crappiness can't even be emulated properly.The movie gets off to a good start when we see a young and nearly unrecognizable Rupert Everett get out of the shower to do two things answer the phone and kill a zombie at the door. That he answers the phone first goes to show just how unimpressed he is by the living dead. He is the caretaker of the cemetery along with his developmentally challenged partner Gnaghi. And sometimes the dead rise from their graves within 7 days of dying. He doesn't know why and doesn't really care either - it's just a job to him. One thing I don't understand about these characters is how they can sleep at all if they have to attend to funerals during the day and battle the undead every night. In a movie like this, that can easily be explained away by claiming that they never sleep at all.There are boatloads of zombies in the movie, and a scene a few days after a church bus went off a cliff is impressive if only for the sheer number of zombified nuns and boy scouts attacking the heroes. Thankfully, it isn't just another Evil Dead 2 or Dead Alive, though those are both good movies. Cemetery Man doesn't easily fit the mold of the horror/comedy. It is both scary and funny, but it's got so much more going for it. It is actually a portrait of a man lost in the world. He has no friends, no lovers, and no goals in life except to keep killing the zombies that rise every night. Because it's his job. He starts hallucinating (or is he?) conversations with the grim reaper and murdering a lot of people - living ones this time. He can't even do that right though; someone else takes all the credit for his crimes. Things take on truly nightmarish qualities (in fact, I wouldn't doubt that large chunks of the movie were derived directly from dreams, that's how bizarre things get) as the nature of the film's universe comes under question.

Distinguishing marks ALL!","Date":"13 July 2006","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Ooh, what an offbeat film this one... Rupert Everett plays Francisco Dellamorte, the caretaker of the small Buffalora cemetery, where dead people have the tendency to return to the world of the living within the first week of the burial. Assisted by his retarded friend and gravedigger Gnaghi, he puts dum-dum bullets and spades in the heads of those returners.Dellamorte Dellamore is probably the most interesting take on the zombie-movie in the 90's. Fans of Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness will notice some (or a lot of similarities) in this film, but overall it's too original to be called a cheap rip-off. And that would do this film a huge injustice... Between all the gore, visceral executions, cruelly dark humor and the efficient mammary of Anna Falchi there is an enigimatic plot not unlike a Lovecraftian nightmare. It's easy to dismiss this film as pretentious, but again that wouldn't do this film justice. Everett's performance in portraying the cynic and lovelorn Francesco Dellamorte is right on the mark and even the assistant Gnaghi isn't portrayed as another retard, in fact he's much more than just that. I have to admit, after the end of the Evil Dead trilogy, it's a lot of fun to see a man dispose of zombies with the same fervor of the late Ash. Shootings, spades and even the odd cross impalement, thank you Michele Soavi in these dark times for horror aficionados.Horror fans, see this movie. Non-horror fans, see this movie too!

Thanks to a trusty revolver and his idiot savant sidekick Gnaghi, this is no problem. At least until the beautiful widow (Anna Falchi) of one of the corpses starts haunting his fantasies.So, you have seen Rupert Everett as Prince Charming in the Shrek films and as Christopher Marlowe in Shakespeare in Love and in other romantic roles. But you have never seen him in a romantic role like this. And unlike in real life... he is in love with a woman!I cannot stress how much better this film is than most of the other rehashed zombie films out there. The movie is unique in at least two ways first, it focuses primarily on a man living in zombie territory without the zombies themselves or his conflict with them being the actual focus (and later in the film they become only an afterthought). Second, the film relies heavily on humor without becoming a comedy like Shaun of the Dead or even like the more subtle Return of the Living Dead, keeping us amused even as we are supposed to be chilled. I suppose the humor level could be compared to Peter Jackson's Bad Taste or Dead Alive, only much darker.The supporting cast is incredible. A mayor so obsessed with re-election he wants photos taken of him grieving over his daughter's dead body, a bodiless head who falls in love with a puking half-wit, the widow who keeps reappearing as other incarnations (Anna Falchi, who gives each identical character their own personality) and Franco the city clerk... whose role in all this is very strange and possibly impossible to determine.The cultural references are subtle, but show that the director is truly a master of the macabre. The primary example, of course, is when the two lovers kiss underneath the sheet, in a very Magritte-esquire camera shot. This is very much like the painting Lovers II, which evokes all sorts of questions about love and modesty. The film as a whole is much like a moving painting, with each shot beautifully framed and angled.There are also homages to A Clockwork Orange and a subplot involving the engineer's rumored impotency -- and the extreme measures he is willing to go in handling that situation. Each little deviation, while not crucial to the central plot, further illuminates how absurd and existentialist life can be. If these detours do not convince you -- wait for the shocking conclusion! Questions will be raised about what is real and what is not -- does each reincarnation of She really look the same, or is this all in Francesco's mind? Is Francesco himself real, or only the creation of an incapacitated Franco? What do we make of the end when Gnaghi and Francesco switch places and we see a physical solipsism before us? Based on things director Michele Soavi has said, I believe he intended the film to be real life -- not a dream or delusion. But what can we then make of the mind-bending moments?If you are looking for a horror film with a sense of humor or a great zombie film, this should be your first choice. Or if you are unsure about a horror film, but you have a love for films such as Dark City, this might be something that will keep you second-guessing your reality. Do yourself a favor and make this film a part of your collection.

The cemetery's deceased occupants however, have odd way of awakening & leaving their graves a few days after they die & try to leave the cemetery to feast on the flesh of the living, so Nogi & he has to shoot them in the head or split their heads open to stop them, however he longs for a better life & hopes to escape the small little town he's in to see the rest of the world, soon he falls in love with a young widow he meets in the cemetery, but when she is bitten & he accidentally shoots her the next day assuming she's dead, he realizes that not only did he kill his true love, but he may very well have to kill her again! Soon he snaps & kills others, but that's just the problem, no matter how many times he confesses or tries to tell someone, they won't listen to him or refuse to believe him.

There are many nice shots that are seemingly out of place in this type of flick, but it helps at to the atmosphere which this movie has buckets off. It helps add to the overall spooky European feel to the cemetery.

So, please let me explain. Dellamorte Dellamore is Italian picture based on a cult Italian horror comic book called Dylan Dog. It is still running (now for more than 15 years) and it is one of the greatest horror comics not just in Italy but worldwide. It is mostly published in European countries, however, I know that DC Comics published only 6 to 10 issues in States. It is a story of Dylan Dog, London´s private investigator who deals with the cases of unexplainable, strange and occult phenomenons (some comparison can be found in Fox Mulder of X-Files). His creator (and an author of more than 100 episodes) is Tizziano Sclavi, who also wrote screenplay for the movie Dellamorte Dellamore. There was one episode of Dylan Dog, called Cemetery Man or Dellamorte Dellamore in which Dylan meets this weird cemetery undertaker Francesco Dellamore and his every day job of wasting zombies. So, the movie is actually based on that comic novel with, of course, a lot of changes. Dylan Dog has now transformed into Francesco and he´s no longer private investigator but a graveyard caretaker. But Sclavi and director Soavi left him with main characteristics of the original Dylan his clothing, his car (an old Wolkswagen - the bug), the same gun and he still has 2 helpers. A bold cop originally named inspector Block and his associate who is now become a retarded giant (in the comic it was a funny person named Groucho and that just ´cause he really looks like Groucho Marx and acts like him). In one particular comic novel called Memoirs of an Invisible (years before the movie) one girl said to Dylan that he looks like an actor Rupert Everett. So, it was really hilarious to actually see Rupert in this role. Congratulations for that one, team!!! However, all this stuff that I´ve told You doesn´t necessary make a good picture. But, it DOES in this case. The directing is marvelous, the acting is great, and the story is simply brilliant. It is for sure one of the best horrors of the ´90-s if not THE BEST.

Really...don't trust your first impressions, or don't avoid it because of its cover or its title.  This has a very rich and highly intelligent content.    First, let's start with something important; this film doesn't take itself too seriously, (spoilers) there's a man in love with a severed head, a man that is getting so used to kill zombies that he doesn't even seem to notice them before killing them, he doesn't even have to look at them, he can simply continue, for example, the conversation he's having on the phone while shooting a couple of zombies that are infiltrating his house, etc.  Theses were just examples of things that don't seem serious in the film, but have a very important and realistic meaning to the story, and to the viewer.    The characters in this film are not heavily-armed soldiers splattering zombies' brains (even though there are some GOOD zombie movies with that type of character).  They are important (especially Dellamorte) and they have a brain that has anther use than being splattered on a wall (generally, at least!).  There are so many mind twists and evolutions in their heads, it's incedible.  Like when Dellamorte has a visit from Death and is latermore no longer able to recognize real humans from zombies, and goes on a couple of killing sprees, or the ending would be a brilliant example of that too.    The gore is generous, even though it is more realistic (??? can a zombie film be realistic anyways???) because zombies don't splatter blood from their heads, because it would normally be coagulated.  But, even with that point said, I have to mention the killing sprees against human people, which are often very bloody and gratuitous.  (Spoilers again) Does anyone remember American Psycho?  Because those who thought that the killing spree at the end of American Psycho was funny, well you should see this one, it is so gratuitous and pointless...This film is an Italian version of American Psycho.  There are many symbols in the film, like when Dellamorte meets two other women that look like his loved one, or the appearance of Death, or (Spoilers again!) the impression given that Dellamorte's assistant is retarded...this makes the movie even smarter and great.  The acting is pretty good, Rupert Everett plays a Dellamorte that could be classified in the Lionel (from Braindead) and Ash (from Evil Dead) rank.  He's not so funny, but he's a very complex character, with lots of secret faces to discover.  The one who plays his chubby assistant is good too, and Anna Falchi is sensual (she does what she has to do in this film, adding a touch of something beautiful and pure in a macabre atmosphere, and that's the symbol she represents).    The directing has something eerie, cold, you'll never feel like a place could be warm in this film, and that's only one of the points that give the viewer a hint of Dellamorte's reasons for going insane.  The film shows so many things that represent our every day life style, and where it really gets a bonus merit is with the fact that it is still a zombie movie...with a brain.    So, overall, I won't give you an overview of the story, because first, there are probably a hundred of other reviewers that already did it, and secondly, because you should discover it by yourself, and if you do that, the spoilers I gave before won't reveal anything important, and you'll be able to enjoy this film in all its goodness.    This is a film that may not please to everyone, because I'll admit it, it's not so attaching, but it surely deserves a watch, especially for those who don't believe that a zombie movie can be intelligent...and Dellamorte Dellamore proves it with even more strength than Dawn of The Dead, which is more entertaining, but poorer in the brain factor.    Watch this if you like good scenarios, zombies, and gore (and if you're one lame pervert that is ready to rent a movie to see a pretty girl's bare breasts, which I am not).  I give it 8/10.

Dellamorte spends the majority of his time burying the dead and then disposing of them a 2nd time when, sometimes, they return as zombies, he doesn't know why they return, and wonders if it happens at every cemetery or just his, anyway at the beginning he seems content if not happy with his life.He then meets a beautiful widow at a funeral and falls in love with her, as they make love on the dead husband's grave, he returns, bites her and apparently kills her before Dellamorte can dispose of him. She comes back to haunt him 4 more times during the film, each having a horrifying end.The town taunts him and they believe he's impotent (which he's obviously not), they also call him the engineer which he does not appreciate.Dellamorte reveals to us during the film that his mothers (maiden?)name was Dellamore - the Italian for love.As the film goes on he becomes increasingly unhinged due to his encounter/vision of the angel of death telling him to leave the dead alone and kill the living, and, the exploits of she who, as the new mayors assistant, cruelly leaves him , after telling him she could only love an impotent man, of course he's just had one major operation. When he meets her the last time she is a student and he thinks it's right this time - but it's not, they charge him for the love he thought was real, this, being the last straw, he burns their flat down.As if the above wasn't bad enough he is being driven mad by the fact that no one is taking notice of him and his crimes, his only other friend, the similarily named Franco gets the blame and when Dellamorte goes to the hospital Franco doesn't know who he is, Dellamorte shoots 3 more people and decides it's time to leave the town, still no-one stops him for the shootings.The final scene where Dellamorte, thinking he has got away from his terrible life, realises there's no escape for him, would be tragic beyond belief, if it wasn't for the touching revival of his assistant Gnaghi, who is bought back to life when Dellamorte, standing over him, realises that Gnaghi has been his best friend all along. Gnaghi then says his only proper words in the whole film Can you take me home please and Dellamorte replies with a grunt.Who or What is Dellamorte? some sort of trapped fallen angel destined forever to manage and dispose of the living and the dead in his cemetery in his own little town in the snowglobe, who knows?. Make your own mind up.This is an amazing film, great atmosphere, well set, full of amusing comedic touches. By far the best horror film of the 90's.See it now!!

The film traverses many genres and types.  Zombie flick, faerie tale, black comedy, gothic romance, surrealism, and even existentialist drama.  Least of all it is a horror film.  It is lacking in atmosphere and the zombies are too vulnerable to imbibe any real terror. With all these inchoate strands, the film risks being too chaotic, but remains beguiling enough to prevent the viewer falling into confusion or boredom.Cemetery Man (I prefer the original title Dellamorte Dellamore)is the third film I have seen directed by Dario Argento acolyte Michele Soavi.  Like his earlier films and most Italian horror, the result is overtly stylised which subverts the plot (if any).  Of the three, I prefer The Sect, as it has the most substance, whereas both The Church and Cemetery Man tend to meander.Zombie children make a rare cinematic appearance.  Other examples being the classic Night of the Living Dead and the not so classic Return of the Living Dead Part 2.  Most film zombies are adult males (extras on set).The ending of Cemetery Man is suitably offbeat.  The two protagonists swap identities.  Gnaghi says his first coherent words, whilst the engineer makes a guttural affirmation.  Whether this reversal is due to Gnaghi dying and then reanimating (albeit quickly) is unclear.A major theme of Of Love, Of Death is the void between life and death, reality and dream.  Death is the only absolute in life, but can love transcend death?  Whilst the living bereave the deceased, all the dead want is to bite.

This was never more apparent than in Dawn in the Dead, when our consumer natures are explored by comparing them to the zombies who are also consumers of a different, but similar, variety (and all played out in a mecca of consumerism - a shopping mall).That's why zombies are scary - because they are us.  They look a lot like us, but their corruption is outwardly visible.  They behave a lot like us, just a bit more repugnantly.  And in the end it's always humans - not zombies - that are the real monsters.(possible spoilers ahead)Dellamorte Dellamore takes this theme and blurs it.  In the beginning everything is black and white - the zombies are the bad guys and must be destroyed.  But then things get fuzzy, as sometimes the undead don't seem quite so bad, maybe just misunderstood.  Eventually the line between the living and the dead is completely erased and we begin to see people for themselves - not as simply alive or dead.  Along the way we get to explore other themes as well, such as (obviously) mortality, love, personal identity, and maybe even the meaning of life.Pick this film up.  It is clever, funny, well-directed, with great special FX, and an excellent performance by Rupert Everett.  Don't forget though, this is a horror film - it has its share of violence (not nearly as gory as many Italian films, but still pretty gruesome by American standards).

You see, the dead have a tendency to rise after seven days, and it's Dellamorte's job to kill them again.  Things are complicated when Dellamorte falls in love with a buxom young widow. This movie may sound boring, but wait til you see it.  Directed by Argento protege Michele Soavi, the movie is a blood spattered riotous good time.  Everett is way laid back, but still cool.  The zombie effects are great.  And there is more humor than you would expect in a zombie movie (check out Dellamorte's assistant falling in love with a zombified head).

One slight annoyance, or nightly chore--if you will--is that they have to keep the newly buried dead underground. For reasons never mentioned, the dead keep wanting to stay undead. (Mr. Soavi, as noted in the IMDb trivia for the film, explains that these 'returners' are brought back to life by the mandragola roots that permeate the grounds of the cemetery. But that really doesn't tell us why, does it?) So Francesco and Gnaghi are kept rather busy returning the dead to where they belong--in the ground. To assist with this endeavor, Francesco keeps a revolver, which he uses liberally to shoot the dead, well, dead again. To complicate matters, Francesco refuses to let the town authorities know what is happening in the cemetery for fear he may lose his job, along with having to fill out all that bureaucratic paperwork. One aspect of all this bizarre supernatural activity that provides a bit of tension is that we never know, as Francesco and Gnaghi never know, which returners are going to take a few bites out of them, and which returners are just anxious to get back to their daily living routine (but really shouldn't, considering hygiene and all).Francesco's night life, shooting and reburying dead people, is more interesting than anything else he does during the day, and that is a sad commentary on his existentialistic existence. For a man whose favorite pastime is reading the phone book, and who observes one day that At a certain point in life you realize you know more dead people then living, things are not going all that well. But how can he get out of his doldrums? It is at this point that the voluptuous She enters his life. The woman, as played by Anna Falchi. He meets her during her husband's funeral. He is captivated by her beauty. How she could be married to such an old man surprises him, but she tells him that it was the sex. Her dead husband was indefatigable in bed. Hmmm...this is an Italian film, after all. Francesco does what he can to get closer to her, but it is when he shows her his ossuary--interesting double-entendre here--that she begins to fall passionately in love with him. It is here that the use of billowing cloth becomes most apparent as they embrace and kiss through the cloth. Billowing cloth appears throughout the film, and combined with the cinematography of long perspectives and close-ups, lends an impressionistic feel to the odd events surrounding Francesco. The ossuary itself is a wonderfully eerie and claustrophobic tomb filled with intertwined skulls, bones, earth and huge mandragola roots, suffused in a brownish-gold light. In the documentary, it is explained that the set was constructed in layers, then put together to create the finished look. It is quite a work of horrific art indeed.As daylight fades and the night comes, blue ghost lights dance around Francesco and the woman. Soon both he and the woman are making love over her dead husbands' grave. Her husband, of course, is not pleased, and attacks them, killing his wife before Francesco can stop him. This being Buffalora Cemetery, however, she soon returns in her billowing death shroud to make passionate love again with Francesco. A little decomposition doesn't get in the way of his ardor, but her biting a rather large chunk out of his neck does. He makes sure she does not return this time.Adding insult to injury, a busload of scouts, the mayor's fun-loving daughter, and fun-loving but careless motorcyclists, get mashed up on the roadway in a nasty accident, and soon fill up the cemetery, providing both Francesco and Gnaghi with much work to keep the mangled returners sedentary. Gnaghi, who does have some personal issues, takes a fancy to the mayor's daughter's head, and he soon has it out of the grave and into his apartment. She also takes a fancy to Gnaghi, and soon the two are singing and chatting up a storm.The film shifts from absurdity to surrealism as Francesco begins to see the woman he loves in other women. Oh, and the meeting he has with Death I suppose I should mention also. Death is rather miffed that he keeps sending the dead back to the grave, so Death tells him it would be better if he just killed the living instead.Francesco's existentialist angst spirals out of control, and he finally seeks escape from it all. Packing a few belongings, and Gnaghi, into the car, he heads out of the town, through a long tunnel, and into the outside world. Or does he? Has he found a resolution to his problems by trying to escape them?

Not that I have a job shooting zombies in the head or anything like that, but a lot of the fantastic elements presented here are metaphors for people and things in real life. I'm not really going to go into a lot of that here, but I will say that this movie works as great proof that horror-comedies with zombies in them can be done to some surprisingly artistic advantages.

The zombies do march the plot along, but this film has another agenda, and the most charming thing about it is that it raises more questions than it answers.This does not mean that I wasn't terrified during several points, or that these zombies aren't any real threat.  There's one scene in particular where the zombies appear so quickly that it's not only startling but actually one of the scariest zombie moments that I can recall.How horrid that in the states the origninal titles are remade.  The original title, or even Of love and death, is so much better than what I get to call it over here on this side of the pond.  But over here films are very often made for the lowest common denominator, and I frequently bewail that.  Now off my soapbox.Another quality that I like about this film is that one could recommend it to a wide variety of people, as it has interesting stuff for all segments of society.  Films that one might show to your intellectual friends as well as your not so intellectual friends are few and far between.  There's something here for everyone, the typical zombie teetotaler included.This film is one of the most visually rich I've ever seen, and definetly not what I expected in my search to sate my zombie craving. It filled the bill and then some, quickly climbing in my esteem to be one of my favorite films of all time, and not just one of my favorite zombie films, which are two separate things.You cannot see this film just one time, I think it needs repeated viewings. I caught a lot with my first viewing, but I'm sure there's much more that I missed.  Such as the film that the television gets changed to suddenly might have been Romero, but I need one more millisecond to determine that.  Also a second (third, etc) viewing is planned because there are thematic elements that I'd like to look for again, with particular attention to light, which gets to play like it ought to in these frames.Cinema should not be stoppable or rewindable.  It was made for the big screen, and it should be larger than life. Although I saw it on my home television, it made me feel the theatre, and that's so rare in a movie that one can rent and take home for a time. This film satisfies me on so many different levels.It's neat to see the zombie genre grow like this.  I prefer zombies to vampires, but I still enjoy seeing the vampire genre grow, and this film does for zombies what Ann Rice does for vampires.Lots of stuff here to discuss, I really liked all the existential themes, and it was very beautiful to suddenly realize how surrealistic everything had suddenly got.  I found the special effects to do just what special effects are supposed to in a film, be there, move things along, but not distract you from the story or the intended effect.All in all, I'd say it's one of the most effective uses of the medium that I can name off the top of my head, the scripting is elegant, the cinematography as only Italians can do, plus lots of love and as Harmony Korine says, there can be no cinema without love Wow.

X. Let's put X in it.' The film goes nowhere, makes no sense, and is pretty badly done. The special effects are also really bad, and not worth paying to see. (15% of their SFX budget was spent on fishing wire.) Reading these reviews here is like some kind of collegiate masters degree program in circle jerking. Everyone who is calling this some master work of art probably keeps their finger on the edge of their lip too much, nods their head, and speaks in a drowsy dismissive satirical upper class tone to everyone who disagrees so they won't be outed as the imbecile pseudo-intellectual sycophant they are. There is no plot to the movie, no coherency, and none of the ideas are followed to their logical conclusion or even exploited to retain the audience's interest; the script makes no sense and neither does most of the dialogue or events. The characters make no sense, and do not act in any consistent way. The police do not follow up leads, the idiot is or isn't actually smart, the hero is or isn't in love.. and the best friend we see twice is now a spree killer but only at the house the protagonist lit on fire to kill the 3 women the best friend actually killed during the fire? What? And this comes at the last third of the film? What? Who does that?Again their behavior is a result of an amateur writing with the 'You know what would be cool/funny?' or 'You know what all really good horror films have in common?' mindset, with no structure to the story at all. There is no continuity, and the only theme is it's set in a cemetery and one of the characters is a man. Otherwise, the film is nothing but an excuse to see the exquisite body of Anna Falchi(Anna Kristiina Palomaki) nude. And well, I can't argue there, that is the only reason this movie gets 3 stars from me, otherwise it is at best some first year art student's film project (hint; the student in question was majoring in booger sculpture, and not film). And this review contains no spoilers because nothing happens in the movie. This is a bad movie, and now only one of the only 3 I have ever walked out on. One being revenge of the nerds part 2, and some other film that was so bad I just went to another theater and forgot about it. It is really amazing to me though how peer pressure for 'horror aficionados' makes them all give great reviews for intrinsically bad movies just because they are horror films and they are fans circling the wagons or something. If you want to see a horror comedy Frankenhooker or Shaun of the Dead are better picks by astronomical leaps and bounds, and they actually have real stories, not a Tommy Wiseau type of after-the- fact reasoning that you are not looking deeply enough to discover the meaning. I won't because there is none. I don't dig through dog turds to discover meat scraps. The message of the movie is is this; if you are a name dropping director you know you probably have a good chance to sleep with the actresses you audition for movies so pick one you really like and write a terrible movie to cover it up. Final review; crappy movie + exquisite woman still can't save film. A horror comedy film where the best comedic acting was done by zombie boy scouts in 10 seconds is not that good.

I think to truly appreciate this film, you have to know what it's really about.Franco is actually the lead character. He is losing his mind slowly. During the first 3/4 of the film, his mind is made up of two sides Francesco and Gnagi. Francesco represents the dominant side of his mind; violent, sexual, brave, and self-confident. The other half of his mind is Gnagi. He only says one word. He enjoys simple pleasures in life like dead leaves and the sunshine. He is repressed by Francesco, who sees him as a loyal but incompetent friend. Francesco falls for the same woman, a whore, over and over. Gnaghi falls in love with a plain girl and even loves just her head without the body. This shows that lust is the primary emotion in Franco.The end of the movie is when Franco snaps, killing a few people and then attempting suicide by drinking iodine. Francesco goes to see Franco and Franco yells at him telling him Get away from me I don't know you. Franco finally realizes that his dark side took over his life. Francesco is just an illusion and this is why the police never catch him and in the end, he admits to the officer that he is the murderer and everyone disappears.In the final scene of the film, which is absolutely brilliant, Francesco and Gnagi basically switch roles in Franco's mind. That's why Gnagi can finally talk and Francesco can only say one word. He is now a mute and Gnagi is dominant. I think this represents an awakening in Franco. Maybe he wakes up from his coma, maybe the whole coma is just a metaphor. I guess that is up for interpretation.At any rate, this film goes way beyond the realms of zombies and horror and delves into the split personality of an unbalanced human being and it does it gracefully and with precision.I love this movie!

Though these films are rare they are a wonderful jewel to wander across.  Dellamorte Dellamore, AKA Cemetery Man, is perhaps one of the most enthralling horror films that I have ever seen.  It is rare to find a film that presents violence, horror, and generally unsettling character quirks in such a frank way that doesn't come off as a cliche'.  The characters are very three dimensional, they are far from the static unchanging characters portrayed in every horror film too date.  The women in the film however are pretty typical, for an anime certainly and quite stereotypically Italian, women.  Revolving around Francesco  Dellemorte, the 'Engineer' or care taker as he prefers, of The Bufallore cemetery. Francesco leads a fairly normal life, excluding the fact that the dead inhabitants of Bufallore cemetary come back from the dead after a few days six feet deep.  Though the superficial storyline, revolving around death in the town and Francesco dealing with the results, is more reminiscent of The Great Gatsby than any other horror story I've ever read.  The film is wonderful in its' simple perfections; the way that although the events of the story are presented in seeming sincerity and entirety, however the film seems to be more of a testament to alternate or unreliable narration. 3rd person narration allows the film to take an impartial stance during all of the events, which makes all the violence and gore seem very surreal and removed.  The entire feel of the film can also turn on a dime, going from a simple horror film to an intricate tapestry consisting of an plot woven from intellectual strands that come together in a very planned and concise way with out making the audience felt led.  Perhaps my favorite aspect of the film is its' introspective nature.  Because the plot is so vague in some parts, which in intentional and not a fault in the film as many believe, we as the audience have to draw our own conclusions about the characters and the events surrounding them.  Though there are suggestions the film never actually takes any sort of stance on life or death for that matter.  The surreal setting and strange events- perhaps even delusions- go unexplained, but the film feels complete at the conclusion unlike many films that leave stray ends. However this film is an independently made Italian film so American audiences have had mixed reactions to the scenematography and story-line. I had a two and a half hour conversation about the meaning of the film the first two times that I saw it, however after I used my 26 year-old cousin as a guinea pig, representing average movie goers just looking for a cool flick, all he had to say was That was fxcked up.  Really fxcking fxcked up.  The story line can be a little confusing and you really have to see this movie more than a few times to get the full effect out of it.  The snow-globe shot, very reminscent of La Cité des enfants perdus aka City of Lost Children, in its surrealism is quite touching and somehow almost awe inspiring.  The amount of plannign and fore-thought needed to undertake such a good shot is very rarely found in an independent film, this is one such film.  I give this a straight 8.5 stars out of 10 because of the genius displayed by the crew, characters, and story line!

Zombie Claudio exploding from his grave on a motorcycle with mortal girlfriend allowing him to feast from her flesh, furious when Dellamorte wished to put an end to her undead beloved. It seems that the film leaves some cold because of the macabre comedy such as the killing spree that ignites supposedly by Dellamorte on live humans. But, I think, the film, through an enigmatic, existential script, shows the disturbing plight of a man burdened with a career that has denied him of a life that perhaps doesn't(..or never has)exist. A theme that never dies is the denial of love for Dellamorte. He's teased by the idea of love when Falchi returns, in various forms as other characters, but is always left wanting. That ending which leaves the jaw-dropping, what the.. feeling I think is hinted at during Dellamorte's chats with Death. His final moment with the Grim Reaper, as Dellamorte decides to leave the only place he's truly ever called home, has Death asking him, Where are you going if you don't understand the difference between life and me? Ahhh, such food for thought once you add that statement to a visual touch igniting that question, as Dellamorte and Gnaghi pursue what lies at the end of a tunnel. What life has this cemetery man ever known other than the job of sending the dead back where they belong, just yearning to return and ending up back in their graves? Besides the more difficult material presented, zombie fans ought to get fulfilled by plenty of gory attacks such as the use of Dellamorte's pistol as it blasts through heads and the way a spate sticks into the skull. There's a very violent sequence where Dellamorte shoots hospital staff and a nun come to check on an old pal of his, comatose on the verge of death, which might leave a few people disturbed..even though it seems played as tongue-in-cheek. And, even before this a massacre leaving several dead by Dellamorte's hand seemed like a dream, until the police detective came pounding at his door with the news(At time I get ahead of my work). And, a gag the film plays with is the police detective who never suspects Dellamorte despite evidence of possible wrong-doing. There's also some very quotable dialogue, often thought-provoking and interesting. There's laughs aplenty through poor Gnaghi, with his ugly looks and rather untidy manner...he's such a lovable(..and devoted) character, though. Some of the effects are flawed such as the little balls of flame where string can easily be seen, or some zombie heads which get destroyed. I guess this could be a bit heavy-handed and outrageous for some, but I found it Gothic bliss with non-stop visual imagery and an unpredictable nature I loved. It's quite wicked, though, and not for everyone. I think this will be Soavi's considered masterpiece like SUSPIRIA was for his teacher Dario Argento. The snow globe that closes the film adds the perfect touch of mystery that leaves you pondering on what you had just finished watching.

First, the negative. While the gore and zombie makeup are good, the rest of the special effects are very unconvincing and distract from the film. There's just too many wires seen for the films good. Also, it has two flaws prevalent with the films of Dario Argentino (director Michele Soavi was a protégé of him). First, the pacing is sluggish and shots seem to go on for too long. The film could've been cut of a good fifteen minutes without losing too much. Also, there is a serious case of style over substance. You won't realize this until the end, but there isn't too much plot for the proceedings.While the film does favor style over substance, the style is magnificent however. The film looks beautiful and often times resembles a dreamlike fantasy more than a zombie flick. This is accented by both a surprisingly touching love story and an absurdest sense of humor. Films that combine horror and humor rarely work, but Cemetary Man plays it smart. The humor is subtle and surreal and complements the film's own sense of inner logic perfectly. The film has atmosphere in spades, and while there's nothing beneath the surface, its clever and free of many of the clichés that are associated with zombie flicks. Some have criticized the twist ending, but I think its perfect.On top of all this is a fantastic performance from Rupert Everett. Before he became a second player in Hollywood romantic comedies, Everett proved to be a good action star capable of delivering very droll sarcastic remarks (which are constantly hilarious thanks to his perfect timing and delivery). François Hadji-Lazaro as his sidekick Gnaghi is likable throughout because of his childlike naivety and despite his actions. And while she isn't too great an actress, Anna Falchi is certainly a breathtaking beautiful woman. Whenever she is on-screen, you won't be able to take your eyes off her. Cemetery Man isn't a classic, but is a refreshingly original take on the zombie genre.

For an Italian zombie movie, the dialogue is incredible just because of the fact that it is coherent in English. The visuals, especially in the graveyard, are wonderful, and at times look almost like Tim Burton did them.

The most accurate opinion I can give on Dellamorte Dellamore is that it is one COOL movie! It's a zombie horror film with a rarely seen level of morbidity, but simply categorizing it among the other film handling about the living dead wouldn't do justice to this versatile piece of macabre art. Dellamorte Dellamore equally is a twisted fairytale-fantasy, a comedy (the blackest kind there is) and, in a weird way, one of the most enchanting love stories I ever beheld. This unusual, yet very efficient combination of styles somewhat makes this film one of the most unique and creative horror films ever released and &#x85;for a often criticized genre as horror&#x85; that's quite an achievement. I haven't got the slightest clue how to inform you about the plot and substance of DellamorteDellamore . I think this film summarizes itself best as The everyday wacko adventures of a cemetery caretaker and his sidekick!. The film introduces Francesco Dellamorte, an extremely introvert and morose man whose name literally translated means Francis of death. His mother's name, however, was Dellamore which means &#x85;of love. These two opposites in Francesco's name also form the pivot elements throughout the whole movie, as his lonely and monotonous existence as the Buffalora cemetery watchman is about to get brutally interrupted with the arrival of a mysterious (but even more ravishing) beauty&#x85;.and not just once! Francesco's companion at the cemetery is named Gnaghi. This slightly retarded caricature's dialog consists mostly of words like Nyah, but that doesn't keep him from being one of the most intriguing and lovable horror icons of the last 3 decades. Gnaghi has a passion for dead leaves and he throws up on girls he likes. The elderly lady who loyally visits the cemetery on a regular base thinks he's a cutie&#x85;. Gnaghi will also learn to know about the wonders of love and (unfortunately) he's also the denied true happiness with his (piece of) bride. So now, what exactly is this brilliant gimmick featuring in Dellamorte Dellamore? Well&#x85;the imaginative approach of the zombie sub genre is, in my opinion. For some unknown reason the recently deceased rise from their grave 7 days after their burial. Neither Francesco, Gnaghi or anyone else knows why this happens or where the origin of these strange event lies. The loyal employee he is, Francesco considers it to be his duty to keep the zombie traffic under control and he has taken it upon himself to shoot them in the head when they rise and then place them back in their graves to rest in peace. Throughout the whole film, Francesco and Ghanghi often face a nearly unbearable workload A terrible accident involving 4 motorcycles an a school bus results in giant amounts of biker-zombies, boy scout-zombies, heartbroken lovers who perpetrate the cemetery etc etc etc&#x85; Every zombie they have to put to sleep eternally is a direct thread to Francesco's and Gnaghi's life, but they don't care&#x85;They have other things to worry about. Our Gnaghi takes pity over the remainders of the bittersweet major's daughter while Dellamorte himself keeps on running into what appears to be a reincarnation of the one true love he accidentally shot through the head. Three broken hearts in a row is a bit much for one man to take and Dellamorte slowly begins to mix up killing the living dead with murdering the living. I know this all was a bit vague and containing a rather amount of wtf?!?'s but I only want to give a plot and structure rundown and I'm reluctant to reveal too many spoilers. At any moment in the film, you have no idea what absurd things will happen next. Because ANYTHING is possible here! Dellamorte Dellamore is superbly scripted, brilliantly cinematography and terrifically acted. Rupert Everett shines and his dialogs and monologues are flawless. Espececially his bored and wit remarks to the most extraordinary circumstances are a joy to observe. And, if you're natural personality is a bit skeptic and your favorite kind of humor is sarcasm&#x85;well than you just can't help agreeing with most of the social commentary he's giving throughout the whole movie. François Hadji-Lazaro, who actually is a French rock musician (thank you IMDb trivia section) plays the role of Gnaghi with much verve and his performance bit by bit learns us that this beloved Gnaghi-creature actually is a lot more intelligent than we're led to believe. The Norwegian model Anna Falchi isn't the world's greatest actress but she's a natural goddess and sometimes, that's all there is needed. And now let's finally talk about Michele Soavi!! Unquestionably Dario Argento's most gifted acolyte, but he never really got out of Argento's or Lamberto Bava's shadows. Dario Argento director took Soavi under his wings because they have the same tastes with film-making and they both share a passion for the genre. Very true, but I think you can't deny Soavi is a lot more subtle than his mentor and merely chooses for suspense and atmosphere rather than to rely on graphic gore. I never saw Stagefright but I vaguely remember The Church and I definitely remember The Sect. Now, they both had a fair share of gore and gruesome make-up effects (same goes for our Dellamorte Dellamore ) but they're not exactly the gorehound festivals Argento often delivers. Personally, I also think Soavi puts more depth and intelligence in his films.

Sergio Stivaletti's special effects, thankfully, are not overdone for gross-out effect and are, actually, generally counterpointed by either visual (as when a horse calmly observes the mayhem caused by a horrible pile-up of vehicles and bodies on a highway) or verbal humor.The casting is surprisingly successful Rupert Everett makes for a charismatic hero, a social misfit who nonetheless craves for a little human warmth and love; Anna Falchi has probably never been better used than in this film, lending an ethereal quality to her three(!) roles &#150; all of whom display a conflict in their feelings for Everett; Francois Hadji-Lazaro is the sort of 'vulgar' (and, in some cases, mute) sidekicks we frequently come across in movies he is very funny at times, as well as touching in his impossible yet tender 'romance' with Fabiana Formica; Formica herself as the girl Valentina is a spunky little character who makes quite an impression, despite her limited screen time (to say nothing of body language!).The script does have some problems, however written by Giovanni Romoli, it is more witty than scary &#150; not in itself a bad thing &#150; but it also gets a bit monotonous around the fifteenth time a corpse comes back to life only to have its head blown away by a gunshot or crushed by a shovel! Also, the idea of having Falchi play three characters is not exactly a novel one &#150; and the fact that these are not even given strongly discernible features to differentiate one from the other doesn't help either. Apart from this, the whole episode pertaining to Everett's alleged impotence could have been dropped. During its second half, the film then takes a sudden turn in a whole new direction by trying to essay some deeper issues, with Everett becoming sort of an 'Angel of Death' a' la Robert De Niro's Travis Bickle in TAXI DRIVER (1976), and again at the end when Francesco and Gnaghi inexplicably exchange personalities. While these thematic flourishes may seem pretentious to the casual viewer, I almost wished they could have been developed in greater detail at the expense of the mostly routine zombie footage, with which we are all too familiar.I haven't seen much of the Italian horrors from the 80s and 90s outside of Argento; DELLAMORTE DELLAMORE is generally considered to be the last great example in this line and, as often happens, it turned out to be a sort of genre spoof. While I don't think the film can truly be compared to the best of Bava or even Argento, I found it to be quite enjoyable, reasonably well made, and even managed to bring a couple of intriguing ideas to the mix.

I for one *love* pretensions, occasionally wallowing in my own crapulent ruminations on art and life long enough to come to terms with 'the postmodern condition'.  But I found nothing so haughty in this swill other than a vehicle for two hours of term-paper procrastination that was more entertaining than anything else on cable television (thank you, Bravo).  I even realized that I was a bit hot in my black turtleneck while drinking my bica.No, there's nothing more to this than a heavy-handed command of camp, the sort of philosophy that one hears in velvet-walled, candle-lit dance clubs, a series of breathy, jittery girls sweating their way through put-on lusty fear, and the lovely Rupert Everett standing around, open-mouthed and pouty, looking blankly yet intently past anything and everything.  It's arguably worth it for him alone, but the film as a whole is mostly laughable and remarkably passive, almost to the point of being self-deprecating.  The concept of combining horror and philosophy-- suggesting a desire to reflect profoundly on such things as the normalcy of death and the depravity and fleetingness of life while satisfying visceral, perverse urges-- is fascinating, but it doesn't happen here.  The film was schlock, pure and simple, and I think anything 'pretentious' would have come from forcing an analysis of it.

During a funeral, he meets She, (Anna Falci) and soon captures his heart. As they begin a relationship, she is inadvertently attacked and bitten during an encounter, which kills her. Knowing that she will become a Returner, he debates about killing her before ultimately choosing to do so. As more and more friends of theirs die and become inhabitants of the cemetery, the two begin losing their grip on reality. When they realize that there's no point in having any love affairs due to their condition and experiences, they use that as an excuse to stay together battling the creatures rather than changing the course.The Good News There's only a few areas in here where it really shines. The zombies scenes, when they're on, are simply incredible. The creatures themselves look great, as the rotting, already-decomposing skin is starting to fall off, and some actually look like some patches of skin are thicker than other areas, giving them an eerie quality. That they're covered with lots of debris from the tomb, as some have tons of sticks and sand on them make them look even creepier. The resurrections of each one are stand-out scenes, and are quite masterfully done. The one nearby the two lovers is the greatest one, being a really beautifully-done resurrection that stands as a great high-point. The other big place in this, and one of the brightest spots in the film, is that the film has a wonderfully poetic, Gothic look to it. The graveyard hallucinations, especially the figure emerging from the burning leaves, is one of the greatest moments in the film full of great images. The look of the cemetery, the interior of the house and much more here are brilliantly composed and designed. It's also got some beautiful scenes of dresses flowing in the wind that look wonderful in the best sense. These are the film's best factors.The Bad News There's some pretty big flaws in this one. The biggest one is that the film's strong message of love and death in here can lead to great drama, but this seriously detracts from the horror the main audience is attracted to. This is advertised as a zombie movie, yet there's only fleeting moments within that actually contain them. They're brilliant scenes, but the fact that the majority of the film consists of the leads running around trying to find a romantic figure for their lives leads to tons of long, boring scenes that are missing moments from what could've been zombie scenes. There's just endless boredom that results when it focuses on the two of them in their relationships, leaving no evidence of a zombie in sight of this. The ending twenty minutes of this is just simply agonizing as it draws up conclusions to the relationship subplots and where it's going to end, but the film simply has nothing interesting to do with the zombies and seem like the background filler in a film that's advertised as such. Another big problem is that the film's incredibly convoluted and doesn't make any real sense. It concerns matters that are extremely vague and them attempts symbolic attempts to weave them into the storyline, making the end result a general headache. This is mostly evident in the love angle, which is just simply confusing and doesn't make any sort of sense whatsoever. The incoherent, third-rate brooding babbling done in conjunction is another factor of that. By adding these with long, lifeless scenes, this one's pacing really suffers as well. It starts off nicely, but then it deteriorates until it's almost dead. The last big one is that there's really no explanation given for why the creatures are coming back. It's a fact of life that only few know about, but how they came upon this would've helped. These are all reasons why this one seems really overrated.The Final Verdict There's plenty of reasons why this one feels really overrated, but there's some good stuff in here as well. This one has a lot of defenders who do like the negative points mentioned here, so if that sounds intriguing, give it a shot. Hardcore, traditional zombie lovers should pay heed with it though.Rated R Graphic Violence, Nudity, some Language and a sex scene "},{"Title":"Possibly the worst movie ever made.","Date":"29 January 2011","Score":"3 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Imagine you have a choice.

I think I will stay away from funny European artsy horror flicks from now on. If they're your kind of thing, power to you. This is a warning for people like me, Americans who liked movies like Dead Alive and read the back of this movie, figuring they'd get something along that line. If you're along that line, forget it. The movie is supposed to be brainy but I think it really just comes off as a lame art flick with zombies and sex. Personally I like good horror movies and psychological flicks to be separate from stupid movies. If you too like to keep things polarized in this manner, avoid this movie.

The rest of the plot is none existent & defies logical explanation...This Italian, French & German co-production was produced & directed by Michele Soavi & one has to say I've rarely seen a film with such a disregard for any sort of plot. The script by Gianni Romoli was based on a novel of the same name by Tiziano Sclavi originally published in Italy in 1991, I'd genuinely struggle to call it a coherent script mind as it resembles an odd collection of bizarre ideas all jumbled together with absolutely no regard for continuity, story, plot, character's or the poor audience who has to sit through it. It's certainly strange with decapitated talking zombie heads, retarded sidekicks, three different people who look exactly the same, blue hovering lights, zombie boy-scouts, the likeness of death formed from telephone book pages & an ending which will make you question whether it was part of the same film you just spent nearly two hours watching. I like films where you have to think, I like films which leaves things open to interpretation & I like films which have hidden, deep & meaningful messages. In this respect I point towards the films of Canadian director David Cronenberg like Videodrome (1983), Dead Rigers (1988), Crash (1996) & eXistenZ (1999) to name a few examples. However unlike Cronenberg's work which can still be enjoyed on many levels in Dellamorte Dellamore there's absolutely rhyme or reason behind any of the confusing & just plain bizarre things that happen, there's no cohesive narrative, things just happen for no reason, people just come & go & it's an extremely frustrating & annoying film to watch unless your a member of the pretentious art-house crowd who lap this stuff up.To give him some credit where it's due director Soavi turns in a gorgeous looking film, the imagery on show is very stylish & almost every frame of every shot is carefully composed. It looks great but it's still a crap film that I had an extremely hard time watching, I really wanted to just turn it off & do something fun like watch the grass in my garden grow. I stuck it out though so never let it be said I don't give a film a chance. The gore was sort of disappointing too, after hearing good things about graphic gore there was a distinct lack of it to my eyes. There's several gunshot wounds to the head like Dawn of the Dead (1978) & Day of the Dead (1985) including a nun getting a bullet right in the eye, there's a shot of a bus running over someones head, there are some zombies, a decapitated talking zombie head which ends up flying through the air & biting someones neck just like the hilarious scene in Zombi 3 (1988) & nothing else really. There's some nudity as well both for the boy's & girls.With a supposed budget of about $4,000,000 Dellamorte Dellamore absolutely bombed everywhere it went theatrical & considering how abstract, oddball, offbeat, weird & about as far from mainstream as you can get it's no surprise whatsoever. Shot in Italy I'm not sure why Rupert Everett agreed to be in this, at least he got some credibility back as an actor from his role in Ispector Gadget (1999)! The acting sucks, I hated everyone especially the ugly deformed retarded fatso sidekick who threw on on a girl yet she still wanted to marry him.Dellmorte Dellamore is one of those films your going to love or hate, as far as I'm concerned you can stick me in the hate camp. I have no idea why but it's become a bit of a cult item & isn't it generally true films with big cult followings almost always turn out to be rubbish &/or disappointing? Not for me at all I'm afraid & I'll give it 1 star for the film itself & another couple for it's stylish good looks, there's a place for DVD's like Dellamorte Dellamore & it's called eBay!

Unwieldy plot, terrible sound, no captions to hear what the characters are whispering unintelligibly and below-average zombie makeups. The only thing this poor show had going for it was Anna F's great looking chest! If you rent it, get your money out of it here with the pause button on the very naked Anna in the graveyard.Why do all gunshots in these Italian movies all have that terrible sound effect used over and over and over????????? Save your money. Rent Dawn of the Dead. Or heres a real oldie for you Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things.

I was lied to. It is not funny (Black Sunday had more black humor). It is not original (can you say, `derivative'?). It is very slow and long and plodding and slow and long and plodding (etc.). Even knowing there was only about 15 minutes left, I couldn't take it anymore and rewound the tape (with extreme prejudice). Please keep all children under 36 and small mammals away from it. If you accidentally consume this film, you will have no choice but to induce vomiting. Bathe thoroughly, go to church, and think happy thoughts about all those good films you've seen until the experience fades.  "}]
