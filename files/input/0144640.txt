I still think he was absolutely great as Chandler Bing. But so far he could never convince me as an actor on the big silver screen. Somehow it just didn't work out as well as it did in those ten years of Friends. But this movie is different. I really liked him in this one.Three to Tango is a comedy that sometimes goes a bit too far over the top, but that also offers plenty of fun and laughter which will make you forget about the few annoying moments. I liked the story about the two architects who will act as if they are a gay couple, just to get that important restoration job. When the businessman also asks Oscar to keep an eye on his mistress, believing nothing can go wrong since Oscar is gay, things start to go really wrong, creating a lot of painful but often funny situations...I guess the fans of the sitcom Friends will love this movie. I know I did and the main reason for that is because Matthew Perry is playing the role he knows best the likable loser who doesn't do much right. Sure, the movie has it's flaws and no the story isn't world-shockingly original, but it offered me plenty of laughter and that's exactly what I'm looking for in a comedy. That's why I give this movie a 7.5/10.

Neve Campbell is adorable, the kind of spunky kooky girl you wish existed in real life - one of her better roles. If you're a fan of Matthew or Neve, you'll love the movie.

Neve Campbell is also in a role that seem to fit her perfectly, playing a sweet, while little wild woman.  Dylon McDermott and Oliver Platt are also great in their parts.  What made the film work was how believable Matthew Perry is as gay, something he suffers from in Friends as well.

I predicted it would be a second rate comedy, cheesy, hardly any romance at all, and just was unworthy of my time, even though I was eager to see the wonderful Neve Campbell who I always enjoy in movies and thought that it could not be horrible, hopefully somewhat entertaining. When a few certain scenes happened I thought that I was in for another clich√©-ridden rom-com. Then, this film totally surprised me by doing something different and changing itself into a very well done and likable rom-com with cute performances from everyone. It's not your average run-of-the-mill rom-com and while some of my expectations were reached, in ways, other thoughts I had about this film were left far behind in the dirt and I was dumbfounded at what a fluffy and fun movie it was. It managed to be slightly unpredictable, and while it was not that romantic at all, I found the comedy to be easygoing and it was just a lighthearted film. I was in this movie for Neve Campbell and came out liking something different about each character in the movie. I don't know if this movie is a must see, but if you have even the slightest bit of interest at all in this film, go ahead, watch it. I was pleasantly surprised, pleasantly surprised indeed.

So why the rock and roll, not tango, sequence during the starting credits? These credits are James Bondish; silhouettes, but without tango music; a very entertaining sequence in fact, but they point to the bits and pieces nature of Three To Tango. It's a film in parts.But some of the parts are downright funny.Matthew Perry (Friends) plays Oscar an architect who with his gay partner Peter (Oliver Platt , Funny Bones) are after a contract to build some swank building for slime ball rich guy Charles (Dylan McDermott).Charles is two timing his wife with Amy (Neve Campbell, Scream) and thinking that Oscar is gay like Peter, Charles asks Oscar to baby sit Amy because he's fearful of Amy running off with an old boyfriend of hers.Of course Oscar and Amy fall in love but Oscar has to pretend he's gay to Amy to keep the contract with Charles, and this keeps the laughs rolling.For instance Amy gets to confide with Oscar about the sorts of girly things women apparently share with gay men. He also has to deal with the men now attracted to him because they think he's gay.Hollywood has an uneasy relationship with homosexuality. These days its common to have the comical gay friend or two mincing about in mainstream films (As Good As It Gets, Beverley Hills Cop and many others).These personalties are added almost strictly for laughs and they are sometimes genuinely amusing but a good dose of homophopia is necessary to really enjoy Three To Tango.Those not inclined to hate those batting for the other side will be a bit under awed by many of the scenes in this film but there's nothing new about that.Still these sorts of movies may well be seen to be an important step in the true coming out of this minority group on the big screen. Judging though by the ill tuned guffaws on air at the screening I attended there's a long way to go as yet.There are often two or three gags going on at once in any case. This film takes the bird shot approach to comedy. Let off a blast of jokes all at once and one or two might hit their target.But still the two central characters, Amy and Oscar, do develop some credibility which isn't surprising since they're the only ones who aren't vapid stereotypes.That might have been not so easy though. I was often still tempted to imagine death mask, hooded, Scream murderers lunging out on the shadows with big knives at Neve Campbell. But she has successfully transcended that sort of typecasting in this film.Her hair is cut shorter and she's determinably bubbly, very different to the haunted, hunted character she plays in the Scream films.Mathew Perry like Campbell is very likeable in what is sometimes an awkward comedy romance, with a gay fear subplot.But overwhelmingly, Three To Tango is often played strictly for fun. Oscar rushes through a market. Instead of knocking over a fruit cart, standard fare for the movies, about six live ducks are thrown at him. Huh! But that was different. And funny.

It has its own charm, own humour (though very American). Santostefano's direction helps the movie move on a steady track.

Dylan McDermott does alright as the arrogant boss. Oliver Platt is decent (although he does go overboard at times). Unlike other more recent American comedies, 'Three To Tango' has a more classy appeal. The background score is very likable. The film is set in the busy city which is beautifully shot. Though it does have its share of toilet humour and over-the-top comedy, I can safely say it's one of the better American comedies, fun enough to watch on a rainy day accompanied by a great background score.

In this case the guy in question is Oscar Novak (Matt Perry), who, with his business partner (Oliver Platt) is competing for a $90 million renovation project.  To complicate matters, Charles, the guy in charge of assigning the project (Dylan McDermott), asks Oscar to shadow his mistress (Neve Campbell) and keep her away from any guys. Oscar doesn't realize why he's been chosen (Charles thinks he's gay) until it's too late. Of course it's only a matter of time before Oscar and Amy fall in love and chaos ensues.Perry essentially does a rehash of his Chandler persona from Friends, which makes Oscar a charming, neurotic klutz who makes little headway with women.  Campbell's Amy is energetic as the independent life loving bohemian and her omnipresent grin and boundless optimism light up the screen (luckily there's no screaming).  Platt, although uncharacteristically subdued, is hilarious as always and has some of the best lines in the film.  Unfortunately, McDermott's portrayal of the self-absorbed- pretty-boy-Donald-Trump-wannabe is suprisingly lifeless and the only weak link in the film. Tango is not groundbreaking cinema -the straight-guy-pretending-to-be-gay (and vices versa) routine has surely been done in every medium known to man.  Unlike many of its predecessor's, however, it manages to be amusing without being offensive Oscar doesn't try to act gay  - he does not become a mincing, effeminate, fop with a lisp - rather he conducts himself as he always has. Although humor is the method of delivery, the movie manages to honestly convey the difficulty people must face when, for whatever reason, they are forced to live a lie.  Oscar's coming out speech emphasizes this point, and manages to be poignant and educational without being melodramatic. If you're looking for an entertaining date movie that doesn't require a box of Kleenex this movie amply fits the bill. "}{"Title":"Gay? I'm not gay.

The perfomances and blend of New York style Jazz music work perfectly.  This film also doesn't do anything to frown on homosexuality. It doesn't try to make the sence of being gay freakish or wrong, but more so dwells on the difficulties of dealing with identity misconceptions and paranoia.This film was 50% genuine comedy, 5% social statement , 45% warm-hearted romance and 100% entertainment.This is one of my more highly recommended films of not only 1999, but ever.

I knew that Three to Tango had something to do with fake gay-ness and that it had been compared to In and Out, a film which I thought was only okay.So I laughed while Perry fell over things and at the other well-timed slapstick comedy, but I kept trying to grapple with a lack of believability.  Suspension of disbelief is so rarely demanded in romantic comedies, but here I was expected to swallow that a young, beautiful, strong, intelligent modern artist character (Neve Campbell) would accept being the MISTRESS of a snake-like rich guy! Excuse me, what were they thinking? It would have been one thing if the character or ANYBODY else in the film brought this mistress life-choice up or asked her why, but it passes unmentioned and accepted as a given to the story.Worse, the big coming out speech that is the climax of the film - in which Perry announces that he must be honest, come out of the closet, and tell his secret...He's not gay! Surprise! - is delivered to an audience of gay professionals who have awarded this fraud with Gay Professional of the Year. Guess what all you people who have been fighting for acceptance and legal rights all your lives, this guy's really a breeder, a het, and he has stolen this honor from you!  What does this audience of thousands of gay people do?  Those softies, those limp-wristers, those pansies - they applaud! They give him an ovation! Yeah, right. In the real world, this would not have been so pretty. And of course, after the one token gay guy jumps up to applaud, the camera only shows us the other heteros in the audience who are so relieved (or disturbed) by this news.As a gay woman, I can usually step out of myself enough to enjoy any kind of well-made film, including romantic comedies about straight people.

I didn't watch it for that reason, I watched it because it was 99c.Much to my surprise and delight, Three to Tango is a charming, family-friendly comedy that deals with sexual roles tastefully, much like Francis Weber's classic La Cage aux Folles (1978) remade in English as the equally classic Birdcage (1996). Or if you really want to get back to the roots of the mistaken-sexual-identity sex comedy, Willilam Shakespeare's Twelfth Night (1602).It's best to know nothing about the plot, that way the twists and turns are more of a hilarious surprise. But yes, the story centers around a classic case of mistaken sexual identity, and from there the hijinks ensue.What's exceptional about this movie is that it does a great job of reversing roles, not just for the individual characters but for society as a whole. A lot like a surreal Franz Kafka story (such as Metamorphosis where the main character wakes up to learn that he is a giant cockroach), Three to Tango puts the main character into a different identity, forcing us to see the world through a different perspective. And much like Kafka's story, the comedy lies in the absurdity of people's reactions, even though nothing has changed except for their perception of the main character.Yeah that's a lot of heady gobbledygook, so let's just talk about the movie already. The overall vibe is a great throwback to those classic & classy Blake Edwards comedies like Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961) or even the Pink Panther flicks. What I mean is that this story is very prim & proper (no crass potty humor or cheap shots) and yet it's not afraid to sink to few good slapstick moments, such as a couples barf scene that's both hilarious and oddly romantic. There are also 1 or 2 totally surreal moments (again much like in a Blake Edwards flick) such as Matthew Perry panicking and running through the streets of Chicago only to run into a flock of... what's the clich√©, pigeons? Haha, not in this case, but I'll let you see it for yourself. It's a quick one so pay attention.Also like in a Blake Edwards flick the music is AWESOME. Some very cool old jazz, swing and big band numbers are peppered throughout, in a way that really punctuates the comedy (similar to the great soundtrack of When Harry Met Sally).Let's talk briefly about the acting. Pay close attention to some brilliant non-verbal acting on the part of each character. I'm talking about their complex reactions without any script. As the story un-twists, each main character has a moment of realization, and I felt they all pulled it off very well. Just by looking at their expressions change, you know exactly what they are thinking and how the wheels in their minds are spinning. Applause for Neve Campbell, Matthew Perry and Dylan McDermott (and director Damon Santostefano) for giving us these powerful yet subtle performances that aren't necessarily as thunderous as George C. Scott's monologue in Patton, but they convey just as much information and emotion to an audience that's paying attention.The script itself is pretty well written, not really full of zingers but very natural and believable. Of course with it being Matthew Perry from Friends fame, a lot of his delivery is in that deadpan sarcastic Chandler vein with Neve Campbell being the perfect spunky counterpart. Also, Oliver Platt and half a dozen other minor characters also did a great job.Definitely catch this movie if you get the chance, whether or not you find it for 99c on eBay, it's worth your time.

And things go from bad to worse when, firstly, Perry starts to fall in love with Campbell and then, secondly, McDermott wrongly presumes that Perry is gay after a series of misunderstandings and miscommunication.

If you're not a fan of Matthew Perry's nervy, nerdy, cheeky schtick then this isn't for you. There's actually a lot going against this movie and it's not going to win over anyone who previously stayed away from this particular genre. The direction by Damon Santostefano is pedestrian, as is the script by Rodney Patrick Vaccaro and Aline Brosh McKenna.But what we have in the plus section is very good for those who enjoy that type of thing. All of the leads (and even the supporting cast such as John C.

It doesn't make the story and movie feel like the most original or clever one. The movie does have its fun and humorous moments but its not ever anything too hilarious. Luckily the movie does work better on its romantic levels. In that regard this movie is a pretty enjoyable and sweet one.It's still a well made movie. Seems to me that Damon Santostefano really is not bad director. Things flow well and it makes this movie a rather enjoyable 98 minutes. The movie has the power to make you forget how incredibly formulaic it all is while you're watching it but in the end you'll realize that this movie really isn't the best or most original movie around in its genre. Also the standard bittersweet ending doesn't help much to this.Matthew Perry isn't good enough to carry this movie. It was just too much his Chandler role from Friends all over again. It was as if he wasn't even trying to play a totally different comedy character. A different haircut is simply just not enough. Dylan McDermott on the other hand was simply good in his role and so was Neve Campbell, whose career unfortunately seems to go nowhere. But the supporting cast is perhaps even better and more impressive with high caliber actors such as Oliver Platt, John C. McGinley, Rick Gomez and Bob Balaban, though they certainly aren't their best playing comical roles, with the exception of John C. McGinley. who is great in basically every kind of role.

However there was a great sale on in a music shop here and I couldn't resist temptation.  So I bought it.  Was it worth my ¬£3.99?  Yes, every penny of it.Matthew Perry is hilarious in this romantic comedy and with Neve Campbell as his love interest, makes it enjoyable viewing.  Chandler still seems to come to mind when watching this but this isn't fair on Perry who really is trying to shake that image off in movies.  It made me laugh from the minute it started to the minute it ended.  For people who hate this film I don't really understand your logic.  It's put to us as a fun loving romantic comedy with a Happy Ever After at the end, so if you don't like the sound of it - don't watch it!  Simple!

Here's a prime example. Perry and Platt's goofball antics, coupled with the piercingly loud big band soundtrack, seems to scream, 'Here are the lead guys. They're funny, so LAUGH goddamnit.'Luckily, once things have settled down a bit, things get a lot better. Perry does his Chandler act (a safe decision) in a plot that seems like a rehash of a 'Friends' episode anyway. People think Oscar (Perry) is gay. He's not, but he has to keep the pretence up because his new boss has him spying on his mistress Amy, to make sure she doesn't cop off with any other guys. A fair concern, as Amy is played by the gorgeous Neve Campbell. Unfortunately, Oscar falls for Amy. Hilarious consequences ensue. Well, mildly humorous consequences, anyway.It's all very fluffy and lightweight, which is no bad thing. Perry and Campbell make a cute couple, and by the time the big band blasts out the end credits, the situations have been resolved, people have been paired off, and certain of the characters get to live happily ever after. Hurrah! Of course which characters get to live happily ever after I'm not saying, but if you can't guess, you don't watch enough movies.

There's also Dylan McDermott's character, who never seems like a real person, either because of his dialogue or his God-awful acting.POSSIBLE SPOILER WARNING********** There was also Neve Campbell's character.

We have something special, she tells Perry's character. Unfortunately, with McDermott's annoying screen-time, it's hard to believe her.

It has been done several times before, the tone, not so much the actual story, and this is in no way the best version. Nearly any of those Meg Ryan romantic comedies are much better (except 'Joe Vs.

But the rest of the film was very funny and the stars were charming and likable and when I left the theater I was glad I saw the film.  You can attribute that to the the charm of Perry and Campbell and of course Platt's presence was quite nice as well.  He always makes me laugh whether he is in a campy, cheesy film like Lake Placid, an all out comedic role like Three Musketeers or in a somewhat serious film like Flatliners. There is just something about him that does it, he has an incredible sense of timing and his delivery is so true and honest that you never really think of him as Oliver Platt, he is the character that he plays, in every movie.Besides the film being funny it is also quite the statement about homosexuality.    But the true strength of the film is Perry and Campbell  both Canadians I might add ).  They are funny, observant and they have some humourous lines about movies that comes into play rather nicely at the end of the film.  The fact that Neve thinks Perry is gay enables us to hear many great observations about dating and relationships from a woman's point of view and I enjoyed that.  I, myself find women to be an enigma and perhaps I will never understand them so I have to rely on movies to give me some of the answers.

Actually, the storyline is quite clever and there are a number of good sight gags, but the dialogue is uniformly dreadful and lowbrow.  The writing is hack and sitcomesque which might explain why they loaded this cast with TV actors.We are presented with two architects who are vying for a contract that can revitalize their ailing business with a roguish developer named Charles Newman (Dylan McDermot).  Charles is married and having an affair with Amy (Neve Campbell), but he is jealous and wants to keep tabs on her. Thinking Oscar (Matthew Perry) is gay and no threat, he asks him to spy on her, implying that it might help him to get the contract.  The rest is pretty predictable.  They fall in love, but she thinks he's gay so there is no hope.  Eventually love prevails (no spoiler here, no-one on the planet could watch this movie and think they wouldn't get together), but not before numerous mistaken gender orientation gags run their course.This film was obviously presented from a gay perspective as a satire on homophobia.  All the gay characters are portrayed as respectable, admirable and wise, while all the straight men are portrayed as rogues, misfits and buffoons.  You see skit after skit where homophobia is lampooned.  Women can't confide in a man unless they think he's gay, because straight men are just too insensitive to understand.  Gays in the closet are bashed repeated with snide remarks.  This probably explains why this film was more well received by women than men, since much the comedy really mocked straight men and their fear of homosexuality.Matthew Perry has made a career out of playing hapless losers with the appeal being that it's funny to see someone who is even more woefully inept than the average viewer.  While I don't find this particularly funny, I will give him his due and say that he is a master of the art.  He gets high marks for being able to simultaneously evoke laughter and sympathy over his plight.  Also, I found his chemistry good with Campbell, and his longing for her was played with a good deal of sincerity and sensitivity.Neve Campbell is really just window dressing here.  Her role is to smile, look cute and sexy and play the love interest.  This is not a real stretch for her since she can essential do all those things by just standing there.Dylan McDermot was pretty dreadful as the scoundrel.   In his defense, he didn't have much to work with since the way his part was written he was portraying more of a caricature than a character.  It is difficult for an actor to slip into the skin of an absurdity and know exactly how to play it.The best acting in the film came from Oliver Platt, who played Oscar Novak's business partner.  He was funny and played an excellent straight man to Perry's clown.  Platt is a veteran and a professional and always brings substance to his supporting roles.This film has its moments but not enough of them.  It is effective social satire and it is mildly successful as a romantic comedy, but it bogs down frequently with too many variations on the same gay theme.  Though funny in parts, it is generally just silliness.  I rated it a 5/10.

Everybody assumes that Matthew Perry is gay because of his business relationship with Oliver Platt. Dylan McDermott takes advantage of this and convinces Perry to spy on his mistress. As predicted they fall in love while Perry tries to play out this idiotic gay assumption. Those who are not disappointed by this depraved piece of crap have obviously fallen asleep before it ended. It is predictable and boring and director Damon Santostefano does little to help it. He previously directed numerous TV shows that are probably a far cry from this. Doing a commercial for cat litter would be a higher achievement. Perry looks like the victim of a bad joke. McDermott is basically playing a one note role unworthy of his time. Neve Campbell as the mistress is reduced to a prop who comes to the obvious realizations, but not before viewers beat her to it. Platt is a decent actor playing a role unworthy of his talent. He basically stands back and takes the hit for the idiocy provided here. There is no real reason to see this film other than to observe a struggling cast in one of their worst career moves. It all boils down to a pointless orgy that should be tramped upon by no less than three people.

The plot is fine, there are a few pretty funny moments, but it isn't anything that hasn't been done before.

It will certainly make several bottom ten lists I'm sure. Tango is less film than a motley series of scenes that are being forced upon the viewer in the hopes that the sum of such will equal romantic comedy and hence box office gold. There is a dearth of decent such films and survey after survey tells us that especially women want to see more of them. While studios know that cramming endless shoot-outs, explosions and clever special effects can save your basic actioner, no such rule of thumb applies to romances.There are traditions is this genre and Three to Tango trots them out one after another like a bad dog show.  We get a Nice Guy who needs a big break from the Super Successful Studmuffin and in pursuit of which puts him in an Awkward Situation ripe for Comedic Misunderstanding where he Meets Cute the Diamond in the Rough object of his affection who just hasn't met the Right Guy. Not helping the viewer forget all this is a discussion in the film that calls attention to such clich√©s (in this case the oft repeated Let's get outta here which I'm sure leaves many with a longing for just such). In place of attractive stars, zippy dialogue and sexual heat what we to make of such bland headliners such as Matthew Perry and Neve Campbell uttering mostly banal lines while never stimulating more than a blush of puppy love.I'm at a loss to explain why anyone thinks Matthew Perry should be headlining films in the first place. With a square head and severe shortage in the lips & chin department he seems custom made for the best friend role. I'm not stupid and know that the culture-piercing success of Friends has Everything to do with it. Fools Rush In is the exception to this and Almost Heroes the rule. Campbell is slightly better, but barely gives off any sparks in what should have been a role played as a firecracker. Of course her role suffers from being as underwritten as the rest of the script and creates the biggest hurdle the audience is asked overcome buying her and Dylan McDermott's relationship.Only in the trite universe that Tango exists in would these two characters become Rich Guy and Mistress. That's right, Campbell's not-really-struggling artist is the kept woman of a tycoon. Excuse me, Mr. Screenwriter, I am supposed to believe that underneath all those funky clothes beats the heart of woman who thinks a sugar daddy's boy toy is her best option?! As for as the comedic aspect of this purported romantic comedy, there's not a single line worth repeating in this whole shebang. Only, and I do stress only, if you are so desperate for a night out that involves seeing such a film (and this summer's Julia Roberts' twosome are no longer even playing at the dollar theater) then see this by-the-numbers effort.

That doesn't go without saying it doesn't have its flaws, because it does; but, first, the chemistry between the two leads is electric.  I really enjoyed Matthew Perry and Neve Campbell work together; they had a sweet connection.  The film also stars Dylan McDermott, in a one-dimensional, thankless role.  `Three to Tango' is about a rich businessman (Dylan McDermott) who mistakenly believes Oscar (Matthew Perry), who is bidding on a $90 million restoration contract, is gay and asks him to keep tabs on his mistress, Amy (Neve Campbell). Oscar, who is not gay, falls for Amy in a big way but she thinks he's gay.  The plot follows the `mistaken identity' genre and big laughs illuminate from it.Now, I think Matthew Perry is a very funny comedian; however, in this film, he is, very much, playing Chandler from `Friends' and his character from an earlier picture, `Fools Rush In.'  He is quite a talent but he is starting to get typecast because of his personality.  I always found Neve Campbell to be a unique actress.  Even though, in every movie she does and `Party of Five,' she does the breathless `Neve Campbell-style' acting always speeding through a sentence as if running out of breath, constantly moving her head from left-to-right and looking to the camera with her mouth open and showing her big front teeth when not speaking.  I forgive her; she was worse in `54.'  There's the always-dependable Oliver Platt, who is given little to do in a small part where he is given some pretty amateurish lines that made me cringe.  Anyhoo, there were many moments where I found myself smiling widely.  There also moments where I felt tension, even when I knew the film was a predictable as a `false scare' in the recent crop of teen horror flicks.  (Sorry, Neve.)I am giving `Three to Tango' a marginal recommendation because Matthew Perry and Neve Campbell make such an adorable couple, but I would better recommend this summer's `Notting Hill' for greatness on all counts.

Working with large gay stereotypes in the name of humor, Three To Tango is the type of film, like the nauseating In And Out, that will appeal to mainstream audiences thirsty for a lifestyle film that's about five years-old in jokes and characters.Matthew Perry stars as Oscar Novak, a ambitious architect who is on the cusp of attaining a very important client, Charles Newman (The Practice's Dylan McDermott). Witnessing a moment of affection between Oscar and his partner (Oliver Platt), the client mistakes the staunchly heterosexual Oscar for a homosexual. Asking Oscar to keep an eye on his mistress (Scream's Neve Campbell) while he's not around, Charles has no idea that the two are falling in love, and Oscar cannot believe that now everyone thinks he's actually gay.Like an episode of Three's Company, Tango plays with very over the top humor and situations. The moment you see someone with a pail on their head, banging it against a wall, you pretty much understand then and there that you're screwed for the next 100 minutes. Tango is never funny, only once in awhile attaining a mediocre comedic pulse.Rather disturbingly so, Matthew Perry manages to climb out of this mess unscathed. I like him so much from his Emmy-worthy work on Friends that seeing him play a Chandler-type character again in Tango is very welcome. Without the great writing on Friends to help him out, Perry is left to his own impressive, but tiring, mannerisms and comedy instincts. Coming off his rather underrated Almost Heroes work, I still believe that Perry has a future in features. Just ones that don't require such hyperactivity.Campbell and McDermott are both stuck with roles that don't suit their personal talents as well. My faith in Neve Campbell dissolves with each new film she does. She has yet to fully drop her annoying acting tics and gestures. There's a good actress in there somewhere, proven time and again on Campbell's lovely TV series Party Of Five. McDermott has to play the heavy here, and due to either bad storytelling or last minute editing, he is left with a role so thin that it comes across as a minor miracle that he would even take the part. Both actors are better off on their respective great TV shows.Bothering me the most about Tango is it's odd chic factor. Like a loaf of bread left out for a year, Tango is moldy and indigestible. It's swing dance music score and opening credits come at a time when that fad has been played out (actual proof of a higher power). The rather 1950's stereotypes of gay men is both appalling and out of date. Inundated with such positive images of gay adults nowadays, Tango's reliance on erect pinkies and I'm no homo! humor is just not worth it. The whole film is terrible, but the moral of the story is both frightful and pass√©.Director Damon Santostefano has a interesting visual palette. The film bops and swings along rather competently. The problem is with the story and the actors. I would be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued to what his next film will be. I wish him luck to find a better projectThree To Tango is basically the typical Hollywood easy comedy that should appeal to the loyal few out there who can fall for this tripe time and again. I don't recommend Three To Tango to anyone looking for a solid comedy, and I wouldn't recommend Three To Tango to anyone with a conscience either.------1/10  "},{"Title":"Plot seems similar to another movie I have seen.","Date":"20 September 1999","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  First of all, Matthew Perry is not at all convincing as Zuul.

However Amy takes to her new friend easily and Oscar finds himself starting to fall for her while his $90million contract seems ever closer yet far away.My wife taped this film and it sat for quite some time before either of us dared to suggest we spend an evening in watching it.  However we did and neither expected much of it, which was good as the film delivered just that &#150; nothing much.  The plot is forced to the point that you know exactly where it wants to go but will be amused by the scenarios the writer came up with to make them happen.  While it serves to lampoon straight men and their (apparently all encompassing) homophobia, it is essentially just a standard rom-com which sticks by the rules and goes where you expect it to.The comedy is a little too stretched with some nice gags but mostly laughs come from the exaggerated set ups from the writers.  The fact that Oscar and Amy's `date' goes as wrong as it does defies sense and makes it feel like the film is just pushing the boat out to try and win laughs without putting in the groundwork.  This takes away from what could have been fresh and witty and just makes it feel forced and slightly silly.While the basic chemistry between Perry and Campbell is quite good, the onscreen relationship is given no time to develop and it never convinces, especially towards the end where it has to go all `pining' and soft music.  Perry is OK but does his usual stuff without really getting out of his well worn career rut of typecasting.  Campbell is given so little to do that she appears no more than a shadow of a beautiful woman.  Worse off is McDermott who has no character to speak of.  Platt fares the best of all but even he can't rise above the material &#150; he has the odd good line but too many that are weak.Overall I doubt anyone will come to this film expecting greatness which is just as well as it is distinctly average at best.  The film's swipe at homophobia is lost in the noise, clutter and clich√© of a romantic comedy trying to force the jokes rather than overflowing with them naturally.

Let's just say that if you're looking for a GOOD romantic movie to rent, leave the former on the shelf and rent the latter, which is a masterpiece of a tear-jerker and doesn't pretend to be something it's not, as does the former.The two films make an unintentionally ironic comparison of just how good actors used to be, and just how bad they are these days.  I couldn't help but grin as I watched Neve Campbell watching Kim Novak and nearly shouted at the screen See, Neve?? Now THAT'S Acting! How many times have we seen the Three to Tango plot in the past ten years?  A couple million?  A case of mistaken intentions and identities as the girl Perry loves must continue to believe he's gay, and thus safe to confide in and even live with, because he must pretend to be gay to keep his lucrative contract with the rich jerk who has assigned him to spy on her.. The same rich jerk who she believes she's in love with.  Why?  If she's so smart and so streetwise and hip and savvy, can't she see what a fool he's playing her for?   Of course not, because, if she could, there'd be no movie, would there..Neve Campbell is nice to look with her ample figure almost falling out of every low-cut costume she's poured into, but at the same time she crosses the line over into the county known as annoying.  She forces her cuteness and sexyness, but she doesn't have to. Matthew Perry plays the same character he plays in Friends with a different cast in a different situation, but the badly-written and terribly predictable script don't give him a whole lot to work with.. nevertheless, he has a certain appeal as he scrunches up his lower lip in his continual quest for the unobtainable. Oliver Platt as Perry's non-gay gay business partner is really the most gifted actor in this film, while Dylan McDermott's one-dimensional rich bad guy is pure cardboard. The plot device driving this whole thing is just old and tired and in the case of Three To Tango, simply unfunny.  Will the right guy get the girl before the end titles roll?

Struggling architects Oscar Novak (Perry) and Peter Steinberg (Oliver Platt) have a shot at a ninety million dollar renovation job, a project to be funded by tycoon businessman Charles Newman (McDermott).  Circumstances lead Newman to believe that Oscar in gay, which makes him the perfect choice for another job Newman has in mind.  He has a mistress, Amy (Campbell), a free-spirited artist, and the jealous Newman needs someone to keep an eye on her during the opening of an exhibition of her work, since he will be unable to attend.  Oscar is reluctant at first (and he doesn't have any idea that Newman thinks he's gay), but it may help them land the renovation job, so he agrees.  He has no way of foreseeing, of course, that he will end up falling in love with Amy.  And, complicating matters even more, for Oscar, is the fact that Amy has been told that he is gay.  How to resolve it all?  Oscar needs the job, but he wants to be with the woman he loves; and meanwhile, everybody thinks he's gay. 	All of which wears thin, and fairly rapidly.  The screenplay is neither clever nor imaginative, and Santostefano has done even less with the material at hand, resorting to slapstick for the laughs (and there are a few).  Perry brings an engaging presence to the screen, and he does know how to play comedy; his timing is good, and the best scenes in the movie are the ones he shares with Platt.  Campbell, on the other hand, leaves something to be desired with her Amy; managing little more than the occasional theatrical smile (squint and show some teeth), she comes across as shallow and pretentious.  Amy (as she plays her) simply doesn't warrant the conflict called for by the story.  And Dylan McDermott is too good an actor for this one-note role he's been handed here, though he does well enough with what he's been given.  The most notable performance is courtesy of Platt, whose character, in fact, is gay, but thought by everyone to be straight; and he plays it for all it's worth.   	The supporting cast includes Cylk Cozart (Kevin), John C. McGinley (Strauss), Bob Balaban (Decker) and Deborah Rush (Lenore).  There's some irony and humor in the premise of `Three To Tango,' especially the twist wherein Oscar eventually has to `come out' as straight, but the finished product is somewhat flat and unsatisfying.  The sight gags are good for a few laughs, but, unfortunately, there's just not a whole lot more to it.      I rate this one 5/10.

I mean it in the way that the jokes are about 50 years old. Basically, Three To Tango's about four people Matthew Perry, star of the world's most overrated sitcom, Oliver Platt as his gay friend, Dylan McDermott as the nasty boss and Neve Campbell who I definitely would. I say four as, contrary to the billboards and name of the film; it really is a fourhanded production, McDermott actually getting more screentime than the supposed third, Platt.What happens is that through a series of hilarious misunderstandings, everyone thinks Matthew's (called Oscar in the film, though he's unlikely to see one) gay. And they also think Oliver's straight. So when Neve she's got a no-nudity clause in her contract so why do they keep on giving us hope? Campbell moves in with him, she talks about girlie things and what have you, they start to fall in love, all the predictable seen-it-millions-of-times-before that you would expect. We're supposed to like her character even though she's knocking off a businessman behind his wife's back, but even so she's okay.For a Hollywood film, it's alright. Of course, this is still the sort of film universe where when people hear - shock!, horror! - the word gay they bump into walls, drop heavy weights, faint and electrocute themselves in baths, but it's fairly sensitive as far as the studio market goes. This stereotyping also ropes in a black sportsman who - quick, phone an ambulance, my sides are splitting!! - is well endowed. Seriously. Loads of jokes, which don't really get much more sophisticated than he's got a big dick abound. With, as before, hilarious consequences.To be honest, it ain't that bad, and Matthew Perry is quite amusing at times. The others, though, are the self-consciously humorous types that make you want to punch them, Oliver Platt is being particularly unlaughworthy. Neve escapes by the fact that her character is the straight man, as it were, and for the fact that, no-nudity or not, she does give us a glimpse of her cleavage in every single scene she appears in.Not really a great, but then its not supposed to be I guess. Just a cheap to make picture with TV actors that has an unusual twist done in a usual way. Though it's target audience seems to be a small ratio of the public a gay audience would find the demeaning gay clich√©s offensive, a straight date audience might still, in these supposedly enlightened times, be uncomfortable seeing it. Still, grab some popcorn, see some lightweight, meaningless drivel with two-dimensional characters for 90 minutes, switch your brain off, then forget all about it for the rest of your life. It's that simple. 4/10.

Every conceivable scenario is viewed through the anticipated discomfort of some token oblivious straight viewer. You know, gay people are merely amusing side dishes in the lives of heteros. Every gag reinforces that distaste is the unquestionable, correct response to gay people. I fast-forwarded through much of it, but something tells me that even the assinine drop the soap joke that straight guys have been laughing at for 4 decades (!), makes an appearance. Check the expiration date on these jokes, guys!I guess the only conceivable worse way for an overexposed sitcom star to step into movies might be to star opposite a monkey (Matt LeBlanc). This movie is also an insult to Chicago which is infinitely more modern/accepting of gay people than this tripe suggests.

I cannot even begin to understand why Neve Campbell, an actress whom I had previously had a great deal of respect and admiration for, selected such a godawfully written movie to even be in, let alone star in. The jokes were not even funny, the references to homosexuals were absurd and disgustingly over-emphasized stereotypes. No, no, I take that back. They weren't even familiar enough references to be called stereotypes. I'd never even heard of gay people displaying the behavior this film attempted to pass off as typical, and even more sickening, as funny. If I were gay I wouldn't bother being offended. The premise of the film was so rediculous and utterly idiotic that it wasn't even funny in the respect of how bad it was. I'm one who tends to find humor in movies which display absurdity.

I was expecting to get a deep, meaningful film that made everyone understand the homosexual community a bit more. What I got was a 'funny' film, with no real message. (A couple of positive notes include looking at Matt Perry's bum, as is always fun, and having a character share the same name as me, Amy.) The film starts off as Oscar (Matthew Perry) and his designing partner, Peter (Oliver Platt) prepare to present their renovation design for this building to a big firm. The film gets right to the quick when the man they're being interviewed by, Charles Newman (Dylan McDermott) is placed under the misconception that Oscar is gay. Well, some random strangers I don't even know told me he's gay, so I'll believe them, and better yet, I'll have him trail my girlfriend because all gay guys are cool like that and are excellent at stealth!Only,Oscar isn't. Not that I have a problem with Matt's, how do you say, selection of balanced-challenged characters, I'm just itching to see him stretch those real acting muscles of his (RC Story better be good..errr...). What I'm getting at is that Oscar clumsily saves Charles's girlfriend, Amy (Neve Campbell)'s art piece (that's right, she's a glass blower, but don't fall under the false impression that she'll be a lesbian and it'll just be another 'Chasing Amy'), and she immediately takes a liking to Oscar, as he does to her. Awwww...I will admit that the chemistry between Neve and Matt was extremely enjoyable, as was the expression Matt's face when Charles told him that he knew that Oscar was 'gay'.The whole film, Oscar pretends to be gay, just so that he can keep the big job with Charles, all the while falling in love with Amy, who loves him back. At the end, Oscar makes a speech about being who you really are, and not needing to 'hide in the closet', just summarizing what this film symbolized as I sure as hell didn't see that dark, hidden meaning (silly me! I thought it was just another romantic comedy! Now I feel dumb!). I'm sure that the 'being who you are' message didn't get to the other audience members, either.What else could I possibly say? The two get together in the end. ('Let's get out of here.' 'I'd like that.' What? Hey! They tied that in from the beginning! How sweet!) It's a good film, and will definitely make you smile more than 'Sweet Home Alabama' (I've yet to shower that off me!).Matt's orange hair is sexy, Oliver Platt steals the show (I hope he's not that flamboyant in real life) and Neve is the embodiment of adorable. And Dylan? I think he was played by a cardboard man half the time, actually... I should check on that.4, because it was predictable and silly, with no real meaning, but I still smile every time I see a chicken. Rent it. It's cute, but it won't wake anyone from a coma.

The transition between generating believability between television and motion pictures is possible, however, few actors are able to accomplish the leap without losing their edge along the way. Case in point Near the end of the film, we are asked to accept Perry's conviction to the female lead, however, there is little or nothing to exemplify true love or chemistry between the characters. In addition, I didn't buy Neve Campbell's Woody Allen-esque neurosis. (Was her character bipolar or what?) It threw the picture off significantly. The best part of the picture was Dylan McDermott, a solid character actor who brings honesty to an otherwise unjustified and boorish script. Still, there is little or nothing to recommend here--I'd suggest renting Chasing Amy instead. Similar premise, but far more depth and better character development.

Then the TV channels started sending it. Over. And over. And over. And today, after who knows how many times I've skipped it(which I thank myself for, even more so now), I decided to give it a shot... you know why? I found out Neve Campbell was in it. Of course, that's not the only reason... Campbell's hot, and a good actress, but she's not good enough to outweigh Perry's aggravatingly stupid presence. No, what really did it was that I found out that John C. McGinley had a role in it. Believe me, as long as he's in it, I'll watch almost anything. I discovered and immediately loved McGinley when I saw an episode of the series Scrubs, and saw, nay, experienced his character of Dr. Perry Cox dish out one hell of a verbal punishment. I'm not exaggerating, I'd watch Scrubs if it was just half a minute of McGinley giving one of his speeches directly at the camera, once a week. I love his character. Since I know he often plays that same type of character(The Animal, On Deadly Ground and The Rock), I hoped that he would have a big role in this, and that he'd make the movie tolerable. Unfortunately, it was not to be. His entire screen-time amounts to about five minutes in total, and the film is even more horrible that I could have imagined. The plot is one of the most ridiculous and unoriginal that I've ever heard. The pacing is so bad that it seems like the director expects the audience through anything. The acting is not worth mentioning. The characters are all clich√©s and stereotypes... especially the characters that were supposed to be homosexuals. Believe me, I try to be tolerable. My personal philosophy of, well, anything at all, pretty much, is as follows as long as it doesn't hurt anyone, I'm fine with it. Homosexuality, metro sexuality, sports... anything. As long as no one is hurt, neither physically nor psychologically. I try to tolerate and respect any and all movies out there... but I can't bring myself to respect this putrid piece of trash. I know the majority of people are(at least, so it would appear, from all the 'entertainment' based on this assumption) ignorant when it comes to homosexuality... but this is too much. This is too far. Every single human being is supposed to have that one impulse-controlling part of the brain, the one that keeps you from jumping on every woman that walks by you, and so on... but apparently the director and everyone else who really had anything to say on the production on this... 'film' didn't have that. Just when you think it has reached the bottom, it goes lower. Why must Hollywood portray homosexuals as constantly horny, will-take-what-they-can-get types? Are we supposed to think they are some kind of animal? A genetic mutation? Why? Just because they aren't interested in women on a sexual level? I think if I ever had one wish granted, it would be to have a... shall we say 'talk' with the director of this putrid piece of cinema. Tell him exactly how ignorant he is... if possible, keep him from spewing of more movies like this. It's people like him and the director of other horrible propaganda-like movies like Saving Silverman, which displayed atrocious amounts of misogynistic tendencies in its tone that are the downfall of morality... not violence in popular media. I don't recommend this movie to anyone... stay away... far away. You might catch 'stupid' from watching it. I know my head feels lighter... about 20-30 IQ points. 1/10  "}]
