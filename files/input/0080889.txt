It is just as funny and delightful today as it was then. Hopscotch is a diamond in the rough and a real gem. Walter Matthau plays an experienced CIA agent, Miles Kendig, who is sentence to a desk job by his idiot boss, for disciplinary reasons.If you are a Walter Matthau fan then this is a must see movie. If  you are not familiar with Matthau then `Hopscotch' will be a great introduction to one of the most talented actors in Hollywood history. Even though `Hopscotch' is based from a novel the role of Miles Kendig must have been written for Walter Matthau. He was brilliant!I certainly don't want to over shadow the terrific supporting cast. Ned Beatty and Glanda Jackson were superb. You will also get to see a very young Sam Waterston. Pay special attention to CIA agent `Ross' played my Matthau's son David.

Realistic characters believably conveyed by the actors and full of great dialogue. There is no excess un-necessary fluff or overkill in this movie! All players carry their weight and are completely believable in their characterizations, operating, as one would expect normal people to communicate with each other, with intelligence and humor. All of this serves to amplify (Ned Beatty's) Myerson character making him look all the more obnoxious &#150; a lifelike caricature when compared to the other key players. This film is a creative alternative to the stale ridiculous explosions, un-necessary violence and 'shoot em ups' seen in many movies. Every aspect of the movie compliments the story line; it is shot on location in the natural settings of Europe and the U.S., which makes it visually attractive. There are no studio backdrops, with dark unrealistic settings. It is unendingly interesting and can be seen many times a year, without becoming old and tired. The only problem it has is the poor picture quality as film sometimes appears out of focus.Jackson and Matthau are brilliant foils for each other, because despite their obvious age difference they are well matched by intelligence and wit, therefore coming off as a believable pairing as players of equal stature, eclipsing the obvious age issue altogether. This is a delightful movie has an apparent absence of Hollywood movie politics. This is one of the very best films I have ever seen for the all of above reasons.

Fearing that his peace, and maybe his life, could be threatened by the organisation, he tells them that unless he is left alone he will spill the beans on all the secrets that he knows about. They call his bluff, thinking he is full of bitter hot air, so he promptly starts sending out to them one chapter at a time. Realising that Kendig is serious, the CIA sets about putting a stop to him, by whatever means necessary!!. But with Kendig having been one of their own once, he is one shrewd customer, and stopping him is going to be one hell of a job.Based on the Brian Garfield novel, Hopscotch is a cheeky comedy paced with utter perfection from director Ronald Neame. Featuring a very accomplished cast, Walter Matthau, Glenda Jackson, Herbert Lom, Ned Beatty & Sam Waterston, Hopscotch relies on a sharp script and incredibly appealing dialogue to bring home the bacon, and it does, admirably so. It's the type of film that one knows is not about winning awards, the kind of film that is an actors film, where everyone is comfortable with the material and appears to be having a great time. The lead role of Kendig is tailor made for Matthau, ambling along at his own pace with a glint in his eye and a quip on his tongue, Matthau carries the film with charming ease. The others all contribute of course, but the comedy gold comes from Walter and that lived in face of his. So bits of drama here, bits of comedy there, Hopscotch is a very well made and hugely enjoyable picture, recommended 7/10.

The film also features Ned Beatty, Sam Waterston, and Herbert Lom. The film received an R rating due to the use of the F word by Ned Beatty's character.Matthau plays Miles Kendig, a CIA operative who is demoted to a desk job after he doesn't do what his boss, Myerson (Beatty) expected him to do. It's just as well with Miles - he's tired and he would like to get out, but not before giving a kick to the shins of the organization. He announces that he's writing a book that will reveal a lot of behind the scenes stuff and scandals. Naturally everyone, including the Russians, want him terminated.Thus begins, with the help of his girlfriend (Jackson), a game of hopscotch around the world as Kendig leads the powers that be on a merry chase. Aware that just about everything he touches is bugged, he feeds operatives all sorts of information, changes his name more than once, rents planes, flies commercial, steals a police car, and arranges for operatives to break into a hotel room where they think he is. In his greatest coup, he calls his ex-boss from his ex-boss' house, which is then blown to bits when there's an attempt to capture him - of course, he's long gone.Both funny and dramatic, you've really got your fingers crossed for Kendig, and the film keeps you guessing as to whether he can get away from the CIA -- and what his ultimate plan is, as well how various elements fit in.Matthau is his usual, implacable, flippant self, perfect for an operative and with the right temperament to try to escape CIA clutches. Jackson gives a classy, smooth performance as his helpmate. Sam Waterston plays it straight amidst the comic elements as he attempts to bring this spy in from the warm and into the cold. Ned Beatty plays the boss like the buffoon that he is. Everything works together to make a wonderfully entertaining film.Highly recommended. Very clever and well acted. Of course, there's nothing like seeing government operatives making fools of themselves.

I have to admit I liked the movie for the congeniality of Walter Matthau. While not as zany (and original) as the much earlier Charade (also with Matthau), Hopscotch shares a lot of the feel of that movie, with villains who aren't quite villainous, and a leading man who is part bumbling and part a step ahead of the game. The supporting cast is fun, though just barely--both of the key CIA guys after our hero are good actors at their best, but they are not at their best here, especially Sam Waterston in a wishy-washy role. Most peculiar of all, and almost scotch-taped into both the plot and the casting, is very British and very different actress Glenda Jackson, a former spy who chips in as needed, and plays a growing role as things proceed.British director Ronald Neame (who directed The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie and The Odessa File) is completely in charge here, making the most of a middling script that uses well worn or barely surprising twists and gags to keep a potentially violent espionage film from ever leaving light comedy. Because in fact the pace is consistent and the filming (under the eye of Arthur Ibbeteson, also British) is completely fine, if nothing to write home about. In fact, this feels like high budget British television, which is something different than pure Hollywood. Or it might feel like 1960 Hollywood widescreen with minor updates--not including the 1960s Hollywood star, Mr. Matthau.But it is Matthau's movie, fortunately. He can be a convincing bumpkin and a warm hearted fellow, and he can be clever beneath his seeming simplicity. All of this is an advantage here, and you are completely on his side as he thwarts, with winks and tricks, the supposedly superior forces of a full press CIA assault. Expect some fun, and you won't be disappointed.

It doesn't look like an expensive movie, though. Listen to the extra feature on the DVD by Neame and you will learn that there was quite a bit of serendipity to this movie.The best part is the remarkable chemistry between Mathau and Glenda Jackson. This alone is enough to give the otherwise far fetched story believability. What we see are two highly intelligent people in a relationship, something rarely seen in movies these days.

In the opening scene, to establish his character, he is in Germany and notices some interesting encounters in the crowd during an Octoberfest celebration. As the Russian spy exits the venue, Kendig confronts him, explains that he has photos, and demands the microfilm spy photo cartridge, in return he will overlook his being there.But Ned Beatty as Myerson is the younger, ambitious, division chief back in Washington. He isn't happy that the Russian spy is let go. So he sentences Kendig to a desk job, a menial filing job, until his retirement. But Myerson has skeletons in his own closet.Kendig decides not to get mad, but to get even. He basically fails to report to work and after a few days they begin to wonder where he was. In fact he was in Salzburg, Austria, visiting his girlfriend, rich widow Glenda Jackson as Isobel. Kendig decides to write a tell-all book about the CIA and in particular about the few he wants revenge against. He copies and sends the first chapter to a number of places, including Moscow and Washington.So most of the movie is about slick, calm Kendig always staying one or two steps ahead of the CIA who are trying to hunt him down. At each new location in hiding he writes another chapter and mails it to all the same places.Good movie, good story, good characters.SPOILERS As the story is getting to its conclusion Kendig, also a pilot, buys an old plane outside London and tells one of the agents he will fly it to mainland Europe, because he knows all the normal exits from England are being monitored. They end up chasing him in a helicopter, and arrive over the cliffs of Dover. Then the airplane explodes over the water, Kendig is presumed dead.

Once upon a time middle aged people were allowed to appear intelligent and desirable, because the culture was less focused on immediate appearances, superficiality and scoring.

Beatty is trying to force Matthau into line or to resign. So he transfer him to a meaningless desk job. Matthau decides that he has to get out of this dead end - and get out with a great deal of money.First, taking advantage of his still existent clearance, Matthau removes his personnel file from CIA headquarters. Then he goes underground, keeping in touch with only one person - Jackson, his old fellow agent and sometime girlfriend. While Beatty and Sam Waterston (Matthau's friend, and the reluctant assistant to the hated Beatty) try to find Matthau, the latter starts typing up his memoirs which will show the incompetence of certain figures (i.e. Beatty) in all the world's major police and intelligence services. He sends copies of the chapters to the publisher he has chosen, but also to Beatty, Lom, and several others. The revelations (all protected by freedom of the press - the book is being published in England, and the English are not apparently one of the secret police groups targeted), make Beatty furious - and more determined than ever to find and silence Matthau.Unfortunately Matthau is so far superior to Beatty in brains and cunning that he runs circles around him. The best moment is when he manages to have the FBI destroy Beatty's summer house. Similarly Jackson does a number on one of Beatty's favorite acolytes, who is stupid enough to be trapped in her home when she has left - and left behind a large, mean Doberman Pincher.The film reaches a climax in England. Will Beatty and the reluctant Waterston catch Matthau, or will he continue making a monkey out of Beatty - or will he find the ultimate escape route? It was a wonderful comedy. Unfortunately it would be the last that Jackson and Matthau made together.

One of the top CIA field agents is being sent to a desk job until retirement. Walter Matthau plays Miles Kendig. His boss is of the Ivy League set and doesn't like the way Miles works. Ned Beatty plays boss Myerson. We don't like him right away. He's a jerk, not as intelligent, and he swears and cusses a lot. Miles won't take it sitting down, and decides to go on the lamb. He destroys the CIA file on himself, and through work contacts arranges for a few new IDs &#x96; passports and all. Miles contacts a former colleague and girlfriend to help him with parts of his plan. He wants to get back together with Isobel (played by Glenda Jackson), who is a well-to-do widow now living in Switzerland. A couple of other main characters are Cutter, a CIA agent who Miles trained, and who is now in charge of trying to find him. Cutter likes Miles, and tells the boss that he will be a step ahead of them all the way. The other character of substance is a Soviet counterpart to Miles, whom Miles like and respects. Miles know how he thinks.. Herbert Lom plays Yaskov, who also likes and respects Miles. Most of the film is about Miles eluding the CIA who pursue him around the globe. He is writing his memoirs and sending them, a chapter at a time, to the CIA and its counterparts in Moscow, Peking, London and Rome. Myerson wants Miles eliminated, and maybe the other intelligence groups do as well. But Miles finds a publisher in London, and his book becomes a best seller. As he sets in play each move, Miles stays a step ahead of his pursuers. Until the very end with its unusual but not very surprising ending. The film is based on a book by Brian Garfield. In an interview that came with my DVD of the movie, Garfield said he wanted to write a CIA story as an adventure and a comedy without the gore and killing. His screenplay kept to the book in that regard. He and Ronald Neame, director, talked about how Ned Beatty had to practice using his profanity because he wasn't that way in real life. That's the one thing that keeps this from being a movie for all ages. Another reviewer noted how the intrigue of the plot keeps one somewhat on edge for what comes next. We all pull for Miles and want him to succeed. The comedy isn't of the loud laughing type, but is dry and subtle at times with some humorous situations. It's an enjoyable film, but there's still something lacking about it. We don't see or know what Miles plans to do from one point to the next --- and there's a sense that he doesn't have a plan. He even says something to that effect at one point. Yet his every move seems so methodically planned out. He moves too smoothly and almost nonchalantly between stops. He visits a forger. He flies to Switzerland. He rents a car. He drives to see Isobel. He flies to London. He visits a man for a job there. He flies to Washington. He drives to South Carolina. He rents a house. He hires an oil truck. He hires a plane and pilot. He flies to Bermuda. He flies to London. He hires buys, rents and flies ad infinitum.The movie was shot in several locations &#x96; London, Munich, Salzburg, Atlanta and other locales. In the interview that came with my DVD, we learn that Matthau was cool on doing the filming portion in Germany. He is Jewish and lost several relatives who were killed by Nazi Germany during World War II. Ronald Neame explains how he got Matthau to come around. It involved giving parts in the film to some relatives. Mathau's son, David Matthau, plays CIA agent Ross. Lucy Saroyan, daughter of Matthau's second wife, plays the airline pilot, Carla. Both tested well for their parts, according to Neame, and he said he made their roles conditional on Matthau's agreeing to the filming in Munich during the annual Oktoberfest there. This movie was made at a time when Cold War spy and espionage films were highly popular. It broke away from the usual suspense and mayhem with killing and gruesome scenes. It offers a light comedic touch to the otherwise dark and often seedy world of espionage. It's not a great or complex film, but a light comedy that most adults should enjoy.

Disgruntled with this dismal situation, Kendig decides to strike back by publishing a tell-all memoir that exposes the innermost secrets of several major world intelligence agencies.Director Ronald Neame, working from a witty script by Brian Garfield and Bryan Forbes, relates the enjoyable story at a snappy pace, maintains an engaging tongue-in-cheek tone throughout, makes inspired use of classical music, and pokes wickedly droll fun at basic spy movie formula conventions (the sequence with a bunch of trigger happy agents destroying a house that they think Kendig is hiding in is an absolute riot!). The fine acting by the top-rate cast keeps this film buzzing, with especially stand-out contributions from Glenda Jackson as Kendig's feisty old flame Isobel, Ned Beatty as huffy, bumbling, foulmouthed superior Myerson, Herbert Lom as Kendig's suave and cagey Soviet nemesis Yaskov, Sam Waterston as the easygoing Cutter, David Matthau as the zealous, but inept Ross, and Severn Darden as the corrupt Maddox. The crisp widescreen cinematography by Brian W. Roy and Arthur Ibbetson provides an impressive elegant look. The various globe-trotting locations -- Austria, Germany, England, and so on -- supply a neat sense of scope. However, it's Matthau's utterly amiable shambling grace and wonderfully relaxed natural chemistry with Jackson which in turn gives this picture an extra additional appeal and energy. A total treat.

An actual clever plot, no extraordinary malice or violence, and likable characters. Sure, this isn't Walter Matthau's strongest movie, but it is still solid and just leaves you feeling good in an uncomplicated way. Also, the chemistry between Matthau and Glenda Jackson works brilliantly and much of the movie is filmed i Europe. What's not to like? I don't have a lot more to add, except that if you are around 50 years or older, you might really enjoy this movie; however, if you are much younger, it may seem too slow and stilted, although I can vouch for the fact that that's really pretty much how life was back then. You young rapscallions probably wouldn't believe it anyhow that the world actually was a much nicer place not too long ago.

If you approach it with the right frame of mind--that is, looking for a clever, enjoyable film--then you'll have a ball. Maybe the reviewers wanted sex and violence? Sorry, none of that here. Maybe they wanted a movie that needed to make a deep point? Outside of satirizing the government and its feeble-minded minions, there is none. No, you'll have to settle for an elegant, sophisticated show filled with memorable characters that help you root for the good guys (or good guy). Can't imagine who would object to that. "},{"Title":"Catch Me If You Can.","Date":"20 December 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy","Review":" Matthau is one of the best field agents in the CIA. He's hated by his boss, Beatty, who humiliates him and assigns him to a desk job, to be replaced by the younger Waterston, who admires Matthau. Well, actually, everyone except Beatty admires Matthau, even his opposite number, Herbert Lom, in the Soviet intelligence apparat.In retaliation, Matthau cheerfully erases his identity and sets about writing a book that exposes all of the most secret operations of the CIA and the Soviets. Beatty is scandalized, and he and Waterston and Lom pursue Matthau and Jackson, his girl friend, all over Europe and the Southern United States. Matthau, being an exceptionally knowledgeable operative, remains one step ahead of them.He tricks everyone into believing he's been killed. The book is published and becomes a best seller. And Matthau, in a ludicrous disguise, insists on patronizing book stores and hearing his work praised.It's treated lightly, with trippingly elegant Mozart pieces used as the score. Matthau's spy is a big fan of Mozart. The scheme begins in Salzburg. Coincidentally, Bizet's Carmen provided the score for Matthau's later film, The Bad News Bears. Twenty years earlier his character had hummed pieces of Carmen in One, Two, Three. Twenty-three years before, he skipped down a hallway whistling a tune from Mozart's 41st symphony in A Face In The Crowd. Should we be worried? He does well as the CIA agent, always his usual, slouching, unpretentious self. Glenda Jackson is strictly secondary, which is just as well. Her popularity always eluded me. She's so domineering and icy. Maybe if you're into bondage or something -- But Waterston is fine as the friend reluctantly drawn into the pursuit, which turns from comic to serious over time, with the threat of termination hanging in the air. In fact, as comedy, this is only moderately successful. There is some drollery in the script but little in the situations themselves. One of the reasons I saw it through to the end is that, with a few changes, this could easily have been a dramatic thriller with Matthau dying. The ridiculous turned into the tragic.Matthau gets to do a side-splitting imitation of Eleanor Roosevelt. Some nice location shooting, a few impressive aerial shots, and nice reactions from a balked and frustrated Ned Beatty tearing his hair out as his house is mistakenly shot to pieces.

Often when one sees an old favourite many years later it turns out to be less enjoyable than one remembered but that wasn't the case with the excellent film.Walter Matthau plays CIA field agent Miles Kendig who quits when his new boss transfers him to a desk job. He doesn't do this by resigning but by shredding his file and heading to Austria where he meets up with an old flame played by Glenda Jackson. He also meets his old adversary, KGB agent Yaskov, played by Herbert Lom, who tries unsuccessfully to recruit him. He does however make a joke about Kendig writing his memoirs which he things is a good idea.Once he has written the first chapter he posts copies to several intelligence agencies including the CIA and KGB. His boss, Myerson, is less than impressed and decides to have him killed before he can cause more embarrassment. Of course before they can do that they must find him and he is always one step ahead of them, often letting them know where he is just before he changes his identity once again and moves on. At one point he actually rents Myerson's Summer house which inevitable annoys him even more.Just because this is a film about a spy on the run don't expect it to be like the Bourne series, after all is is a comedy and Matthau is playing an agent at the end of his career, not an ultra-fit assassin. The acting is good, especially from Matthau and Jackson in the two main roles. The only slight fault with the film is that there is quite a lot of swearing from Myerson which means parents might not want younger children watching it.

The script is so much fun that you can easily coast along wondering where it all leads. The casting is inspired with Walter and Glenda running the show and Ned Beatty providing the perfect counterfoil.I've worked my way through the 'Best spy thrillers' lists and for whatever reason this gem doesn't rank, but it is by a long way the best of the lot.The script is fast-paced and very witty. The acting is excellent - understated and very amusing. I have to think the Director was more interested in the plot than the plaudits because he set every scene to play for what it was - and the dialog is quick and apt. The musical score for once really acts as a sub-dimension that increases one's pleasure - no blaring fanfares when nothing is happening, or to herald a big moment - but Mozart used better than ever.Beats the rest of the 60s-2000s offerings by a long way. It's a keeper!

Walter can crack you up with just a look, as he does to great effect in Hopscotch. This movie graced the local cinema in Leeds and along i went with a couple of friends just to relax and enjoy. We all thought the plot was terrific and Matthau perfect for the role. His constant whistling and humming of Verdi, Mozart etc adding to his persona of someone enjoying getting his own back on the miserable Masterson. I particularly like the way Herbert Lom's character accepts with good grace - they're old spy friends - that he's been caught out, and then continues on his merry way, until he too has cause to be alarmed at Matthaus forthcoming book. The whole movie is an enjoyment and at times laugh out loudable - if there's such a word, especially when Masterson shoots up his own home. Unfortunately my VHS copy has worn out and it is yet to be released on DVD. Please someone hurry up and re-issue it again. Great fun, great movie.

When the Criterion Collection released Hopscotch on DVD several years ago, I immediately went out and bought a copy.I do not know another movie quite like it. I first saw it as a pre-teen in the early 80's. It is a clever spy story, replete with twists, turns, and comedy throughout. I cannot think of any other (non slapstick), spy chase movie with plenty of shooting... yet no one gets killed in a shootout. The movie is full of twists and turns, but no matter how many times I see it, I still love it. Hopscotch has a well written screen play with a strong supporting cast.Some people will suggest there is poor chemistry between Glenda Jackson and Walter Matthau, but I tend to disagree. The chemistry is there, it's just different than the kind usually shown in Hollywood. The dialogue in their first scene together is sublime. How many fun spy stories do you know which have an entire scene built around metaphor, and, yet, don't feel force-fed?I finally got around to reading Brian Garfield's original novel last fall, and although I liked it, I didn't find it nearly as enjoyable as the film. But to be fair, the movie treatment, also by Garfield, is different. It is like comparing apples and oranges.I have never been a groupie of Matthau or Jackson.

As may be expected the late, great Walter Matthau turns in a terrific performance as disgruntled CIA field agent, Miles Kendig, who is, in the beginning of the film, unjustly demoted by his direct superior, Myerson (played by Ned Beatty) for successfully using his own initiative in shutting down a major spy ring in West Germany. The rest of the film deals with Kendig's wonderfully unique approach to teaching his boss why his demotion was such a huge mistake, all the while having the time of his life pursuing romance while eluding pursuit by the CIA, KGB, Scotland Yard, etc. Wonderfully entertaining and not to be missed ! "},{"Title":"Matthau's Masterpiece!","Date":"25 January 2005","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy","Review":" I've been a Walter Matthau fan for as LONG time. He was excellent with Carol Burnett in PETE 'N TILLIE, and Elaine May in A NEW LEAF, but when he did HOUSE CALLS with Glenda Jackson, there was an instant chemistry that neither Burnett or May came anywhere near matching. Somehow, the pair of Jackson and Matthau just meshed and complemented each other perfectly.In HOUSE CALLS, Jackson does a hilarious physical comedy bit with Matthau, a scene where they try to achieve the old Hayes Office movie requirement that people on the screen MUST make love with at least one foot on the floor. May, in A NEW LEAF, has a similar physical comedy bit, a sequence where Matthau, on their honeymoon, has to help the inept May to correctly put on a complicated night gown which she'd bought for the big night, and promptly made a mess of. In that sequence May approaches, but does not match, Jackson's on screen chemistry with Matthau.HOUSE CALLS was good... but HOPSCOTCH is the ultimate comedic triumph for Matthau! We're talking about a low key, sophisticated, INTELLIGENT comedy here; the lovers of frat house farces need not bother to watch. No double entendres, no fart jokes, and no out of context obscenities anywhere... but nonetheless a hilarious film. The current crop of young directors could learn a LOT from watching this one! Interestingly, Matthau's smooth, civilized, understated comedic style is counterpointed beautifully by the more conventionally broad, less sophisticated comedic style used by Ned Beatty in the film.Matthau plays Miles Kendig, a very unconventional CIA agent who also just happens to be the very best that the Agency has. After a successful operation, he finds that his new boss, Meyerson (Ned Beatty) does NOT consider the operation to have been successful. Meyerson is new to the job, and somewhat crude in his approach to intelligence and counterespionage, in addition to being possessed of all of the personal charm of a suppository. As retribution he takes the maverick Kendig out of field operations, intent on keeping him as a filing clerk until retirement.Kendig, having decided that the spy game had become too dirty and crude for his tastes, decides on his OWN retirement plan; simply, he writes a book in which he exposes all of the past failed operations he knows about, and tells of the current stupidity of Meyerson's regime. To rub everyone's nose in it (especially Meyerson's), he mails one chapter of the book at a time to ALL of the world's major intelligence organizations... who are unanimous in their conclusion that Miles Kendig MUST be eliminated, and the publication of his book stopped, at all costs! Therein lies the tale...Kendig's assignment is to stay one step ahead of those who are out to stop him while having a little fun at their expense (and wreaking some well deserved revenge at the same time) in a round the world chase; a game of global hopscotch. In his somewhat goofy quest he's ably assisted by friend / ex-lover / ex-CIA agent Isobel von Schoenenberg (Jackson), operating out of her home in Salzburg, Austria.Sam Waterston puts in a bravura supporting performance as Joe Cutter, Kendig's protégé and replacement, who NOW has the assignment of taking Kendig out of play. Cutter very much likes and admires Kendig, but he'll carry out his job if he can... as Kendig no doubt taught him.One thing that gives this film a lot of it's charm and sophistication is it's music. Walter Matthau was a long time lover of classical music, and a great deal of the sound track is a tour de force of Mozart!Matthau was always intelligent and classy in his work. Watching HOPSCOTCH makes me miss him all the more... NOBODY out there now can give us his brand of humor. I won't tell any more of the plot, you'll have to see the film for yourself. All I can say is that the film is, without question, the crowning career achievement for Walter Matthau.It's DEFINITELY worth your time!

His opposite number for the Russians is Herbert Lom and they hold each other in mutual respect.That's not good enough for Ned Beatty the new guy in charge who after Matthau recovers secret microfilm from Lom, Beatty wants to know why not terminate Lom. Matthau considers that kind of stupid because he and Lom know each other so well that if that ever happened and the Russians put a new guy in charge, it would take him years to get know a new man's moves as well as Lom. In point of fact by the time this film was made, the whole Cold War had settled into something like this.But Beatty's a true believer and he relieves Matthau. A move Matthau doesn't take lying down. He writes his memoirs and threatens to reveal all including a lot of embarrassing moments for the CIA. Beatty than makes it a crusade to get Matthau and Matthau with the help of girl Friday Glenda Jackson leads them on a merry chase on two continents.As ridiculous a fool as Beatty is made out to be, in point of fact he's not wrong. But this was the Seventies, the age of Watergate and as is said in the film, National security is not the all embracing excuse it once was.As for the ending you'll find almost the same ending in Charley Varrick, a movie that starred Walter Matthau that I liked a lot better.

Matthau's serious but silly 'one step ahead' role couldn't have been played by anyone else so well. But I believe the biggest and only problem I had with this film was the amount of unnecessary swearing by the CIA agents that were after him. It was incomprehensible and only made me dislike the movie, along with strange overdubbing on specific scenes that didn't really belong there. Other than that, a flawless action/spy movie that could still hold up in today's standards.

It's really a one man show with the supporting cast playing second fiddle all the way to the late, great thespian. The film dates back to 1980 during the height of the Cold War. Matthau plays Miles Kendig, a veteran CIA agent who takes down a Soviet spy ring but declines to eliminate the leader of the operation, his KGB nemesis, Yaskov. Kendig has been friends with Yaskov for years and when his new boss at CIA headquarters, Myerson (played by an unpleasant Ned Beatty who continually employs the F word throughout the movie), is angered by Kendig's refusal to eliminate Yaskov, he transfers the veteran operative to the file room.Kendig then destroys his own file and takes off without telling anyone at the CIA where he is off to. He then meets with Yaskov who offers him a job as a double agent but Kendig regretfully declines. Yaskov then asks Kendig what he'll do with the rest of his life and when Kendig replies that he's uncertain, Yaskov suggests that he write his memoirs. This is the impetus for the second act of 'Hopscotch' in which Kendig decides to take his revenge on his former employer by sending the first chapter of his memoirs to various spy agencies around the world including the CIA. The memoirs chronicle a long history of CIA 'dirty tricks' in which Myerson had a big hand. Myerson is bent on eliminating Kendig in order to prevent the big expose.The rest of Hopscotch involves a cat and mouse game where Myerson, along with the operative who replaced Kendig, Cutter (ably played by a young Sam Waterson), attempt to discover Kendig's whereabouts before he finishes his manuscript and has it published. Kendig ends up globe trotting including a trip to Myerson's house in Georgia where he places firecrackers inside the living room and then phones the CIA from Myerson's home phone. The FBI joins the CIA and they end up shooting up the house as the firecrackers go off. Kendig escapes by taking one of Myerson's bumbling operatives hostage, driving off in a small truck (since this is supposed to be a comedy, no one ever tries to jump Kendig while he brandishes a gun, knowing full well that he would never shoot anyone!).Nothing much else happens until the climax when Kendig rigs an old bi-plane to fly via remote control. As Myerson chases the bi-plane in a helicopter, Kendig pushes a button and the plane explodes, leading the CIA to believe that Kendig is no more (it's not clear how Kendig makes it look like he never got into the plane). With the CIA no longer chasing him, Kendig's memoirs becomes a best-seller and he walks off into the sunset with his old flame, Isobel, played by the now retired Glenda Jackson.We first meet Isobel at the beginning of the film where Kendig rekindles his old relationship with her in Austria. Unfortunately, the chemistry between the two actors fizzles, since they are never seen face to face until the end of the movie (they communicate constantly via telephone). The same goes for all the other principals (including Beatty and Waterston) who have virtually no screen time face to face with Matthau (there's a rather flat scene where Kendig ties Cutter up in a hotel room).If you're looking for many twists and turns, you will not find it here in 'Hopscotch'. The whole thing is a rather pedestrian affair, adapted from a popular novel whose screenplay did not translate very well into the intended visual tour de force. Hopscotch is also supposed to be witty and amusing but is undercut by the one-note, nasty image of the CIA, represented by the aforementioned unpleasant Myerson, bent on taking down a rogue agent at any cost. The CIA's attempt to eliminate Kendig (instead of capturing him), ruins the otherwise whimsical tone of the film's narrative. On the other hand, Waterson's 'Cutter' and Herbert Lom's 'Yaskov' are too warm-hearted to have much effect on the proceedings, as the story simply plods along.My late father, a big classical music aficionado, was a big fan of this movie and with a plethora of all that Mozart constituting the film's soundtrack, I can understand why. Despite the endearing musical score, Hopscotch's plot is a big dud as its protagonist's machinations do not prove to be very clever. If you're willing to give Hopscotch a 'pass' based on your love for Walter Matthau (as Roger Ebert did in his 1980 review), then you might deceive yourself into believing this is a well-written movie. It's not and in reality it's a rather dull and boring affair!

The problem with this that after the plot is announced, the movie becomes tedious at best.Matthau is the zany CIA man who is demoted and decides to write a tell-all book which is quite damaging to the agency. He meets his match in acting with Ned Beatty as the head of the bureau. Beatty knows how to use that salty language and whoever made his hairdo should have received some sort of award. His hair is arranged as if it's in a flower pot.Glenda Jackson, already a 2 time Oscar winner by the time this picture was made, plays his ex-CIA girlfriend who aids him in his attempt to allude everyone.There are some funny scenes but there is only so far you can go with such a plot.

Callow screenplay by Brian Garfield and Bryan Forbes (adapted from Garfield's book) was criticized at the time for turning the original, darker spy material into another lightweight affair retooled for its stars, Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson (reteamed from 1978's House Calls); but if the critics were implying that the film was a comedy, they were way off the mark. Matthau and Jackson once again show a nice rapport, but the sharp-tongued dialogue is sniggering and pushy instead of funny, particularly a 'fag' joke that was de rigueur for 1980. The film looks terrible in dull browns and olive greens, moves sluggishly, and is filled with characters one would cross the street in order to avoid. *1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"Pleasant enough","Date":"23 January 2002","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  Hopscotch would have been a much more mediocre comedy without Walter Matthau's brilliant performance. If you don't care about the rather implausible plot twists, this mild spy flick can provide good fun. Glenda Jackson is somewhat miscast as the Austrian lady friend, but her and Matthau's first scene together is simply delectable.

By permitting a middle-aged, non-athletic WAlter Matthau to take on both the CIA and FBI and make monkeys out of both is stretching credibility to the limit; it's like the Bourne Identity without the fx but the difference is that in the case of Bourne you were in no doubt that his masters were seriously angry and he was often seconds away from termination whereas here, Matthau seems moments away from only a custard pie in the face. Whilst it's undeniable that the film is intended as a comedy drama it never seems to fire up fully in either genre but is pleasant to watch because of Matthau who again co-stars with Glenda Jackson which makes it possible that the whole raison d'etre for this was the success of House Calls. As late TV movies go this is certainly watchable but that's all.

This is not a laugh-a-minute picture&#x85; it moves at a snail's pace and takes its sweet time unfurling what proves to be an only mildly-clever story. That said, it's great to see Walter Matthau in a comedy from an era when comedic leads weren't forced to be maniacal slapstick stick figures&#x85; Matthau plays it cool and smart, which lends the film an extra touch of class.If the script had been re-written once or twice more with a focus on comedic tempo and extra punchlines, Hopscotch might be a classic. As it is there are simply too many minutes that slip by without any jokes, too many talky scenes featuring men in suits, sitting, and too much repetition How many times can we watch Matthau taunt his pursuers while they do slow burns in frustration?Sam Waterston makes an appearance in the film, proving that he was always 45 years old, and Ned Beatty plays some sort of furious bloated midget who somehow got to be head of the CIA. Not much else going on here&#x85; there are some cute moments, if you're in such a mood, but otherwise I doubt you'll make it through the picture&#x85; oh, well&#x85; there's always masturbation.GRADE B- "},{"Title":"Tired, slow, dull.","Date":"3 February 2006","Score":"0 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy","Review":" After all the positive comments here I was shocked by how bad this was. The dialog is labored, the pacing extremely slow, the situations lack plausibility or interest. A sad comedown for the actors and director. The underlying impulse seems to be anti-Nixon, or more generally anti-uptight Republican types. I could sympathize with that message but not in this ham-handed form. Also an age thing happening the old guy outwits the young guns--except the young guns have no heft at all so who cares? It's not seriously involving and not funny enough to be a parody. Hard to believe this is a Criterion DVD. I felt almost as let down as when I saw the excruciating A New Leaf. If you want a good Matthau movie try Charley Varrick. "}]
