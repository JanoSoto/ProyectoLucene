[{"Title":"Affectionately crafted piece of art that is sadly under-appreciated by the typical modern soundbite moviegoer.","Date":"15 August 2004","Score":"106 out of 129 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":"  Wow - I used to think Guns Of Navarone was a try-hard, almost-there type of near-classic war film that had muffled sound, used a bad coloring process, was poorly lit, was limited by budget and the technology of the time. Boy, was I WRONG - I had seen this film several times, all on conventional/cable TV, VHS and even Laserdisc prior to the recent UCLA restoration now out on DVD. I never completely engaged in the reality/experience of this movie. It was as if I was listening to Beethoven's Ninth on an AM clock radio in an adjacent room. The newly-restored DVD in its original widescreen format showcased on a big screen TV in surround sound is the ONLY way to fully take in this piece of art, unless you perchance get lucky enough to see it in a cine complex.Unless you have viewed this film in its original condition in a theater or restored, letterboxed with proper-sized screen and sound, your previous/future comments have ZERO merit, as far as I'm concerned. So many people here have commented on this film lacking action and being a bore - I could not disagree more. Although I have not read the book (something I rarely do anymore due to an unfortunate accident years ago), this movie resembled a well-written novel. It was FULL of REAL character development, bringing you mixed emotions - at times you love, feel for, loathe or despise them - even the German army officer, during the interrogation/capture scene (which I will not spoil), had a warm, admirable quality about him. I will purchase/rent/borrow an audiobook of this, if at all possible, because Alistair MacLean has some of the best written adventure material ever brought to film. The action in this film was aplenty - maybe not a Schwarzeneger thrillride, but that would have made it completely unbelievable. The character development, internal conflict and subplots more than adequately fill the non-action lulls, if you want to call them that. One reviewer here commented on a shipwreck scene of 15 minutes that seemed like forever - the entire realistic shipwreck sequence was barely five minutes long, FYI. Without going into too much spoiling detail, there was constant suspense while the Germans were nipping at their heels all film long. It contained espionage, several hand-to-hand combat sequences, several shootings, knifings, cars/trucks being blown up, carjackings, explosions, dive bombings, mortar bombardments, strafings, assassinations, etc. With six men and two women against several dozen Germans, you can't justifiably get much more action packed into a script unless you would unnecessarily/unrealistically insert more just to intensify the film. The film did not really need intensifying as the plot was strong enough on its own merits - as were all the characters and the subplots surrounding them.The editing is top-notch. This film is lovingly woven into a tapestry with nice artistic dissolves/fades/graphics transitioning scenes (chapters) and furthering character development and story lines - the accompanying music only enhances those transitions like adding melted butter and/or salt to cooked vegetables enhancing their flavor. To me, this film is very warm and comfortable when it needs to be, but also cold and abrasive at times to make its social commentary. Carl Foreman scripted another great masterpiece with his usual pro/anti-war statements wrapped neatly in an entertaining adventure that makes one think. The end retrospective sequence with the Dimitri Tiomkin score is indelibly touching and unforgettable - a rather unorthodox approach for a war movie.The sweeping landscape photography and several cultural touches truly captured the beauty and flavor of Greece and its proud people. Ironically, when at Blockbuster, I coincidentally chose this film to view with my son - on the Opening Day of the XXVIII Olympiad, being held of course in Athens, Greece. I read somewhere that the people of Greece still hold this film in high esteem and were/are very proud of the way their nation was portrayed - they should be. Unlike many other movies made abroad, Guns Of Navarone affectionately honored its host country and its people. My 7 year-old film-making-wannabe son absolutely LOVED this movie, even better than his most recent film classic viewings... The Magnificent Seven and Bullitt. When I told him many here at IMDb said this film was boring and over-rated, he commented are they nuts? This coming from a kid who loves James Bond, Superman, Jaws, Jurassic Park, Star Wars, Star Trek, Power Rangers, Lost In Space and Jonny Quest as well as Classic Rock, film scores, Legos, Hot Wheels, plastic model kits, gymnastics and PS2. Guess there is hope for the future generation after all.Some of the very best action/adventure films ever made have very little constant action, FYI. I recently overheard a teen boy in a video store who said Raiders was a slow, boring film - of all things. No wonder the cumulative votes of classic films on IMDb do not entirely mirror or reflect what critics have historically said when they initially rated and/or reviewed them. I try to overlook the current technological advancements of today when compared with films of yesteryear in order to objectively critique a film. GUNS OF NAVARONE is no exception - made before traveling matte (blue screen) technology and CGI effects. Sure, the rear-screen projection photography and miniature work was not perfect, but no other film of its era was, either. Those factors aside, this film is EXTREMELY under-rated - this film is a stand-alone classic of its genre and amongst other all-time great films... a genuine piece of art.Ranking just under the ten-star rated Bridge On The River Kwai, Guns Of Navarone is an instant-classic and will always be so (on a LARGE SCREEN in its original widescreen format); due to its solid foundation of high production values, endearing score, good writing, strong plot/character development, the fine actors to play those characters and loving direction. Kudos to all who worked on this film.

It's hard to believe so much time has gone by, both since my boyhood and since the film was made, but Navarone still holds up very well, a character-driven film alive with nuance and subtlety. It moves at an assured clip, not rushed or forced, making the viewer follow its story through every agonizing twist and turn.What makes the film especially good is the crisp dialogue, lines that point up the moral and philosophical argument at the heart of the film and which resonate today as much as thenMallory The only way to win a war is to be just as nasty as the enemy. The one thing that worries me is we're liable to wake up one morning, and find we're even nastier than they are.Franklin I can't say that worries me!Mallory Well, you're lucky.Good performances abound, but the best by far is David Niven's Cpl. Miller, a complex character whose smooth front and witty banter conceals much of the conflict of the film. It's he who tangles most often with Gregory Peck's Mallory, and has at least three scenes in the film that are top-rate. We may like Miller because he keeps things humming and provides welcome comic relief, but he's no less the center of the film than Peck or Anthony Quinn, the two well-cast leads whose relationship is enriched, at least from our remove, by the unique vow Stavros has made to Mallory about the unsettled business between them.The plot is a thing of beauty, moving with all the synchronicity and clever precision of a diabolical cuckoo clock. The special effects have suffered more than a bit from the march of time (though one should remember that was the only part of the film that won an Oscar in 1962). Some process shots are cringe-inducing now. But the pace is still gripping and the payoff spectacular. Here's the film that was the template to every popcorn actioner that came after, its imprint recognizable on everything from the James Bond movies to Star Wars to Indiana Jones. That's impressive, but more so is that Guns remains as entertaining as any one of them, and more thrilling than most.

Mr. Peck, David Niven, Anthony Quinn et al. are in top form, each of them bringing their respective characters to life and the story likewise. The action scenes are impressive even by today's standards but in my opinion they are only a secondary pleasure. The main pleasure is watching the divergent and forceful personalities cooperate, conflict, confound and finally triumph. Suspense is maintained throughout. I also liked the way complex moral issues were addressed. Another bonus is the portrayal of the Germans. Here they are not all depicted as impersonal inhuman cruel monsters. The full mosaic of human personalities is shown on their side too. But don't get me wrong, they are still a formidable enemy who keep the outcome in doubt. Strongly recommended, 8/10.

He was an absolute fan of this kind of movies and I guess I've inherited that passion from him, because since then I try to watch and buy as many (classic) war movies as I can find. So far I already have several of them in my private DVD collection, but until now, The Guns of Navarone wasn't a part of it. The main reason for that is because I hadn't seen it before and therefor didn't know what to expect of it. But now that it was finally shown on television, I was able to tape it and to watch it.When in 1943 the Germans are attempting to bully neutral Turkey into joining the Axis, 2,000 British troops are trapped on the small and strategically unimportant Greek island Kiros. Something has to be done to save them and there is only one way to get there by boat. But it's impossible to come near to the island because the only sea route is defended by two gigantic German anti-ship batteries, deployed in a massive cliff side bunker on the island of Navarone. An air attack has been attempted before and proved to be useless and the only option that is left is sending a team of six Greek and English mountaineers to meet up with partisans to try and dynamite the guns. The team does not only face the almost impossible task to conquer the difficult terrain, they also have to try to get past a German garrison and to make things worse, there also appears to be a traitor among them...About one thing I'm already certain I'll buy this movie on DVD as soon as I can find it. This is one of the better classic war movies that I've seen lately and I really had a good time watching it. Not only does it give a more realistic view on the war, the characters are also a lot more realistic. They aren't as invincible as you sometimes see in other classic war movies (think for instance of Where Eagles Dare (1968)), in which the Americans or other allies seem to carry some kind of magic shield around them that can't be penetrated by German bullets, while they can kill hundreds of the enemy with only one bullet. In this movie they have to deal with all kinds of difficulties like difficult terrain, a traitor,... and yes, even the good guys can get killed or wounded.What I also liked was the fact that this movie was shot in Greece and therefor gave a realistic feeling to the setting, without feeling like a brochure for a romantic holiday (like Captain Corelli's Mandolin). I know, we all expect that and believe that it is normal when we see it, but I've already seen otherwise and it's something you didn't always get at the time. Think for instance of the movie The Battle of the Bulge (1965), which was supposed to be situated in the Belgian Ardennes, but which was shot with olive trees in the background and in a desert-like terrain. And trust me, I'm Belgian myself and I know the region all too well, so I know that there really isn't such a type of terrain to be found there.Next to the good story and the correct decor, this movie also offers some fine acting from a great classical cast. With Gregory Peck, David Niven, Anthony Quinn, Anthony Quayle,... you get some of the most famous actors at the time and they all did a very nice job in this movie. Add to this the fact that story was very good, that the action still looked nice, that everything was shot in the right country and that everybody spoke the correct language. Then you know that there is absolutely nothing more I could ask for in this movie. I give this movie a well deserved 7.5/10.

They fought a pitched seesaw battle with the Germans until almost the end of the war. A great deal of debate about the feasibility of the whole operation has raged with military historians. The reason that the British Army and forces from their Commonwealth countries was to keep Turkey in the position of benevolent neutrality. At least this was one of Winston Churchill's stated aims and The Guns of Navarone makes the case for it.But specifically this film deals with a pair of menacing looking naval guns embedded in a cliff with a big rock overhang. The RAF can't get at the thing to destroy from air, so a commando team is put together under the charge of Anthony Quayle. A couple of native Greeks are along, Anthony Quinn and James Darren, an explosives man, David Niven, a tough anti-fascist resistance man whose service dates back to the Spanish Civil War, Stanley Baker, and a mountain climber, Gregory Peck.Peck has to get the team to climb a forbidding cliff which is the only area of the beach the Nazis don't guard because they think nobody can land over there. Peck gets the job done, but Quayle becomes injured and Peck gets the responsibility for the whole mission.The Guns of Navarone is filled with tension as the men keep getting into and out of one situation after another. The film crackles with excitement and really should be seen on the big screen, it's the only way you can appreciate the special effects which got The Guns of Navarone its Oscar.The film marked a screen partnership of Gregory Peck and director J. Lee Thompson, they did four films together. Thompson specialized in these action adventure films. Later on Thompson partnered with Charles Bronson in some of his best films of the seventies and eighties.To get the young into the theater, current teenage heart throb James Darren is in the cast. We even gets to hear him sing in Greek which is in fact Darren's own ancestry. Irene Papas is also in the cast as his older sister and Gia Scala is her silent friend.Despite setback and betrayal our team continues on. The climax of The Guns of Navarone is exciting and unforgettable and should not be missed.

Guns of Navarone is not full of flag-waving or patriotism, but wearied veterans who just want to get this job done. Spielberg's soldiers in Saving Private Ryan also conveyed this outlook. When we first see Captain Mallory, he is grim faced and upset that his leave has been canceled (as we later find out, he had a good reason for seeking leave!). There is not a lot of emotion expressed at seeing Major Lucky Roy Franklin, but the two men are glad to greet each other as comrades. But the movie's first emotional tailspin is when Squadron Leader Barnsby gives a report on his group's failure to attack Navarone. You can see the fatigue on Richard Harris' face as he tells the bloody truth about what is being asked of him and his men. A fine cameo by this late, great actor. The characters don't smile or joke too much, and when they do the viewer can plainly see that there's more to tell underneath the surface. This was a great job of acting by all concerned, and they are given wonderful dialog to accompany the stress and tension of the time. The top scenes are when insubordination looms among the characters, not because the person in charge is being sadistic or unfair, but because of the fatigue of everyone. The action and stunts are great, and this is the first movie I've seen that has both cliff climbing AND cliff diving!

Many scenes take place without dialog or score, merely background noises like wind, feet crunching gravel, and the like. Some of the tensest scenes are made more so by our hearing only what the characters would hear. For example, early on in the film, the lead characters undergo a storm at sea and approach a dangerous narrows, and until the scene's climax, all we hear are howling wind, driving rain, and slamming waves. A musical score tells viewers how they are supposed to feel and often telegraphs shifts in plot or mood. As used in this film, the absence of music heightens the drama and makes the action more immediate. What score there is is thus more effective, earning its composer an Academy Award.

The Guns Of Navarone at first looks like a basic mission - in 1943 a key channel in the Aegean Sea is commanded by two gigantic German siege batteries on the island of Navarone; these guns prevent the reinforcement of a British island garrison nearby, and if the garrison falls, it will persuade Turkey to join the Axis powers, an outcome Berlin is counting on as the war in Russia has turned against it with the defeat at Stalingrad. The guns cannot be bombed by air, despite heroic efforts by the RAF, and so is brought in a key Allied operative who has been working in occupied Crete since its fall to the Germans in 1941.  Captain Keith Mallory not only can speak the languages of the area with superb fluence, he is Keith Mallory, the Human Fly, the best mountaineer in the world.  He feels he cannot climb the 400 foot precipice atop which the German batteries sit, but he likes nothing better than a well-organized setup upon seeing that he has no choice.  With the help of his closest combat comrade Stavro (Anthony Quinn), Mallory is assigned with Major Roy Franklin to ferry British commandos - one of the a wise-cracking explosives expert, Corporal John Anthony Miller (David Niven)- on the perilous journey to the back door of Navarone.  But the infiltration is fraught with danger, and when Franklin is badly injured, the real crest of the story unfolds, the moral dilemmas of the team as they must complete the mission while deciding how to handle an injury they cannot treat.  And as if that were not enough, one of the Greek resistance operatives helping the team turns out to be a traitor after Miller finds his explosive equipment has been tampered with.  It leads to yet another of the several arguments that ensue through the film between Miller, the soldier who does not want the responsibilities involved, and Mallory, who is determined to finish the job.  While one of the arguments doesn't make much sense - Miller is horrified when Mallory admits lying to Roy Franklin so that upon eventual capture Franklin will give away inaccurate information; this is by far the most humane solution to the intolerable dilemma the team has faced - overall the clash between Mallory and Miller adds enormously to the film's tension, thanks in no small part to the excellent performances of Gregory Peck and David Niven.The sets and props of the film are superb, and overcome the comparative cheesiness of some of the special effects.

The calm and cool personality of Captain Mallory is beautifully and completely translated into a real life figure on the tinsel screen by Gregory Peck.The excellently crafted and terrifically directed thunderstorm sequel during initial landing of these death defying commandos on the rugged cliffs of the island of Navarone speaks volumes in the field of first-rate cinematography and choreography which was bound to manifestly imitate real life scenes, is definitely no small thing to accomplish.It should be a matter of concern for the film directors and producers of this IT age who endeavor to present craziness aided by computerized animated graphics with a fictional footing which is replete with immature and childish imagination. Whereas, the classic movies of the 50s and 60s carry a captivating and sublime moral based focus coupled with superbly crafted historical re-enactment of the events defining final moments during the many upheavals of mankind.As a matter of fact, the cinema has historically transformed from a more detailed and painstakingly directed moral based drama to a rather feverishly fictional depiction of immature ideas.Last but not the least, the great novel of Alistair Maclean is perfectly translated into real life sequence by the all time crafty skills of J.Lee Thomson and for posterity to admire.

But I don't doubt that Greg, David, Tony, Anthony Quayle, James Robertson Justice, Richard Harris, Stanley Baker and that German officer who later played Russian generals in James Bond movies (Walter Gotell) are putting on a remake in that great movie studio in the sky. Justice has a good bit part as Commander Jensen, the man who sent them on that suicidal mission and so deadpanly told Gregory Peck he'd have to put off his vacation. Justice, famous for looking like Henry VIII, looks like an old publisher I wrote for. Acted like him, too. This is a movie you can take the kids to; there's no foul language and no graphic violence.

In the novel only one character, Andy Stevens, has an internal problem to solve which is his fear of fear. This character does not make the transition to the big screen. The other characters, Mallory, Andrea, Miller, and Brown are all very professional at what they do and there is no philosophizing over the moral ambiguities involved in war. The characters played by Irene Papas and Gia Scala are male characters in the novel. Although it is tempting to think that the addition of the female characters is used strictly for the purpose of having someone for Gregory Peck to kiss, Foreman uses their inclusion to great dramatic effect. In the novel it is Miller who shoots the traitor named Panayis. To illustrate how different the novel is from the film thematically, this is how that scene is described in the book. Carefully, accurately, he shot Panayis through the heart, twice, blew out the candles, turned his back and was half-way towards the door before the man had crashed to the ground. I think it is the way Carl Foreman chose to adapt the novel, as well as many of the gripping visuals brought to the screen by director Thompson that have made this such a memorable film for many people over the years.

This picture should please most action-war-adventure buffs.Followed by an inferior sequel also written and produced by Carl Foreman titled 'Force 10 Navarone(1978)' by Guy Hamilton with Robert Shaw,Harrison Ford and Edward Fox.

The special effects of films in those days might have been primitive compared to now, but those days had a trick or two up their sleeve to make the most of them, that we can no longer experience.And outdoor theaters might as have well have been invented and built for this movie.  I can't remember a more suspenseful cinematic experience in my whole life-- or a more dramatic night out with Dad.  I was glad that he was there, just a reassuring foot or two away, in case the terror became unbearable.So it surprised me to learn here that Guns of Navarone appeared only in 1961.  That would make me twelve or thirteen years old, not eight. If I remember it so vividly, how could I be so wrong about the time?

Though it may be hard to remember now that the premise has been used so much, the impossible mission theme was NOT a common staple in action films until this movie. The question of whether or not the team is going to pull it off is, for once, not as simple as many other simple-minded movies have made it. There are moments where the mission is endangered by just about everything imaginable the CO being critically wounded, suspicious enemies, personality conflicts, wrenching moral dillemas, a traitor in the ranks, being captured by the enemy. The storyline plays out like the most extreme manifestation of Murphy's Law everything that can go wrong DOES go wrong.The team put together here couldn't be more incongruent with each other. Gregory Peck's world-class mountain climber who becomes the team's reluctant CO, David Niven's hot-tempered, authority-defying sapper, Anthony Quinn's Greek ex-Colonel who has promised to kill Peck at war's end, Stanley Baker's weary soldier who's tired of the unending slaughter, a young Greek national who wants more and more of it...the real miracle is that they manage to get as far and as well as they do. For every step forward, they wind up paying for it. Be it in blood, moral anguish, or pain, no one comes out of this mission unchanged or unscathed. I honestly feel that it is this theme of sacrifice that is the key to the greatness of The Guns of Navarone.

I'm not so sure now, although to be fair, I'm rarely in the mood for a war movie. But I remembered this one fondly...but I guess absence makes the heart grow less fond. Nevertheless, it's a good story with a stellar cast.There were 2 places where the special effects were terrible. One was when Peck and Niven close the huge iron doors to lock the Germans out of their huge gun complex. The way their shadows fall, it is so very obvious they're in front of a painting, not in front of iron rails. And a few minutes later, looking out toward the sea from the guns...wow, how cheap looking.The big problem with this film, however, is the running length. There are times when things drag, and no wonder...the film lasts 2 hours and 38 minutes. It didn't need to. They could have easily cut 15-20 minutes. But my sense is that they kept it long to make it seem like it was a bigger movie than it really was.I have to admit that while Gregory Peck is not one of my very favorite actors, I also believe that Peck can do no wrong. I don't remember a film where he was any less than wonderful. Enough said.On the other hand we have David Niven. Over the years my like for Niven has declined considerably, and it seems to me that -- as in this film -- the main reason that he could be very pompous, and there were several scenes in this film where that was called for.

Niven is excellent as the cynical bomb expert with the often cutting one-liners, counter-balanced by Gregory Peck's heroic, yet at times reticent, Captain Mallory.  The cast is an assembly of highly talented actors; put together over 40 years ago now, and obviously Anthony Quinn must get a mention for his ruthless portrayal of the Greek resistance fighter Colonel Andrea Stavros.  He adds dynamism to every scene he is in and the viewer is attracted to the sinister edge to his character.I first saw this film as a boy at the cinema in the early 70s and several times more on the big screen throughout the ensuing years.  Recently I acquired the video and have also seen it screened on television.  (I'm sure though that when screened on television some butchery was carried out on some of the scenes, in particular the point where Quinn's character stays behind on the hillside to pick off pursuing German infantrymen.) Furthermore something that I missed as a pre-pubescent watching the film, but more evident to a man nearing 40, is the beauty of the actress Gia Scala (Anna)- what eyes!It's a film that seems to be part of my life for no other reason that it is a good story which appeals.  The climax is still thrilling although there are some similarities with Where Eagles Dare i.e heavy hammers against large metal doors - if you've seen both films you will know what I mean!  And for the real Film anoraks out there look out for the character actor Tutte Lemke who rarely gets mentioned in any credits.

And finally Anthony Quayle, the instigator of the entire mission.A tremendous cast, therefore, along with able support, make this film an adventure as gripping & exciting as you'll ever find. It's not mindless violence in the Rambo mode though; there are lots of soul-searching, betrayals & self-doubts along with ultimate sacrifices too, which only helps to flesh out the film with believable and likeable characters.Its quite a long film at 150 odd minutes, but it doesn't feel like it. There is too much going on to make you drift for a second. It may look a little dated as it celebrates its 40th birthday this year, but again, don't let that put you off. For me this is far superior to a lot of modern day war films, with little or no political correctness or over indulgent flagwaving detracts from a fine film.My favourite character would have to be Niven's Corporal Miller. A happy-go-lucky soldier who refuses to become an officer because he likes what he does and wants to keep it that way; yet he has that typical English charismatic charm that makes Niven the perfect choice.Peck is also good, although he does seem just a little too stiff and 2 dimensional at times as if he doesn't know what to do in order to expand in his character and therefore plays it safe and just goes through the motions.Quinn & Quayle are always good value and Navarone is no exception. Quinn especially adds a certain Greek charm & emotion to the film that again makes the movie far more accessable and entertaining.Recommended, especially in Widescreen or DVD****/***** "},{"Title":"Perhaps the Finest Adventure Film Yet Devised; Very Well-Acted and intelligent","Date":"18 June 2005","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":" This film, made in 1959, remains the mark against which all adventure films are measured. Director J. Lee Thompson deserve the credit for having brought Carl Foreman's complex and literate adaptation of Alistair Maclean's rather spare narrative to glowing life. The film is about individual responsibility and how men approach that aspect of self assertion on Earth. Every man and woman in the film is measured according to this single yardstick of worth; this is true of the Germans and Greeks as well as the British and Americans involved. This is the chief source of the film's power. Mention needs to be made of the overlong but very fine music supplied by Dimitri Tiomkin and of Peter Yates' work with the action and second-unit scenes also. Basically, this film is so well acted that it stands out over all others also on the counts of its taut, contexted action-story events line and the professional work done by those who bring their roles to life. Minor roles such as those played by Walter Gotell, Tutte Lemkow, Alan Cuthbertson and James Robertson Justice are standouts; the main cast has only three less-than-perfect efforts, those given by Gia Scala, James Darren and David Niven who seems out-of-place at times but never stops trying. The others with major role-- including Gregory Peck, Anthony Quinn, Anthony Quayle, Stanley Baker and the great Irene Pappas--all are given unforgettable scenes to play, which they achieve exactly as conceived. The entire action as carried out under Keith Mallory, played by Peck, becomes a stunt mission as the detached unit play out aspects of their responsibility as humans in a dangerous combat situation. Scenes such as the sea approach and cliff climbing, the pursuit of the mission team across the island, the escape from German capture after that happens in the village of Mandrakos, and the final destruction of the guns are hard-to-forget. The climax of the film comes when Peck and Niven try to blow up those two great radar-controlled guns on Navarone, so thousands of allied soldiers can be rescued from the nearby island of Cheiros. The denouement and ending are universally found satisfying, and the resolution of character loose-ends is handled superbly. One could wish the characters and those who played most of them had been revived. The film seems as fresh to my mind, having seen it recently, as if it had been made yesterday. Incidentally, I have argued that the team involved was the model for the Star Trek ship's bridge crew about 5 years later.

Hurray! Yahoo! Whatever else you want to say!I was amazed at the high level of quality throughout, from the top notch cast (especially Sir Stanley Baker and Irene Papas who excel in smaller roles which are less showier than the bigger box office draws of Peck, Niven, and Quinn) to the terrific Oscar winning special effects. Now I realize that most people watching this film now will complain about the aforementioned effects, but they are the kind of people who rate movies based on today's technologies.  Face it, in a few years films like Gladiator and Titanic will look as hokey to moviegoers as some older films look to us!  We must suspend our disbelief and enjoy the production values of older films, only then can we truly appreciate their genius.Anyway, this war classic moves along at a brisk pace, never forgetting that there are characters involved behind the canvas of action.  It also manages to maintain a sense of humor about itself, what a rarity! Without resorting to the pandering humor of today's movies.The on location shots in and around Rhodes provide a great backdrop for this action classic.  This film was a huge success when it came out, even managing to snag Oscar nominations for Best Picture and Best Director.  (sadly, the director would never again match this critical success)The DVD contains wonderful extras, trailers and interviews with the surviving cast members, and of course it's main attraction is the restored print in widescreen!If you're in the mood for a great action flick that manages to combine terrific acting, direction, adventure and even humor, you could do no better than this 60's classic.

Then they have to destroy the mighty twin guns up in the hills that blight the British operations on the Aegean waters. Adapted from the Alistair MacLean novel, it's directed by J. Lee Thompson and stars Gregory Peck, David Niven, Anthony Quinn, Anthony Quayle, Stanley Baker and James Darren. Music is scored by Dimitri Tiomkin and cinematography by Oswald Morris. Watching it now it seems oh so very formulaic, but it was rarely the norm back than for war films to always follow this brand of high end adventure staples. The makers take a bunch of men from the various social spectrum and thrust them together for an impossible mission. We have the stiff backed guys with moral reasoning at their core, the rough and tumble men, all face fuzz and machismo seeping from every pore, and a young baby faced youngster blossoming into a man by the day. They will be put through the mangler at regular intervals, faced with scenarios to test their metal, all while the group view each other with suspicions of motives and reasonings. Here the character sub-plots, their hang-ups and frets, do not bog down the fun or the excitement, they enhance the narrative. We also get two ladies entering the group (Irene Papas/Gia Scala), and they too add some meat into an already beefy stew. Action is a plenty, suspense equally so. While of course there's twists and turns to input some mystery and pot boiling character dynamics. Elsewhere, Tiomkin provides a robust Golden Globe Winning score, and Bill Warrington & Chris Greenham's special effects won the Academy Award in that department; they look at times a bit weak now, but who cares right? The array of screen work, matte paintings and miniatures blend superbly with the outdoor location photography, which points us to a time when film makers worked their socks off to create the magic up there on the screen. Oh and the scripted dialogue, just wonderful and beating an intelligent heart.

Featuring tough men on a mission against ridiculous odds, most of these films used war, not to express any moral or patriotic sentiment, but as vehicles for action, aimed primarily at the young modern audiences of the Vietnam era, and their aging WW2 era fathers.The Guns of Navarone is one of the worst films in this wave. Based on a novel by Alistair MacLean, it's a routine mission movie in which a rag tag bunch of guys join forces to bomb a German gun emplacement. The film ignores the politics of WW2, ignores the mindset of those taking part in the film's suicide mission and reduces Germans to sock puppets.Superficial and stupid, the film anticipates Steven Spielberg's boy's own adventures set against serious backdrops, and contains several scenes akin to Saving Private Ryan, most notably one in which our heroes wrestle over whether or not to kill an enemy officer.One can rationalise these films being made during WW2 (dehumanising the enemy is common in propaganda), but to make such a thing in 1961 (or 1998 as in Spielberg's case) is simply unconscionable. David Lean, and the moral probings of various other Brit directors during the 50s, had rendered this stuff obsolete by 1961, and yet the film was a huge success in the US, raking in piles of cash. No surprise that The Guns of Navarone was released just before the Vietnam War, just as Ryan was released before the second Gulf War, both films priming their nations for some down and dirty warmongering (cf historian Patrick McCormick).By the time the Vietnam war hit and was drawing to a close, The Guns of Navarone's imitators (Kelly's Heroes, The Dirty Dozen etc) had found a way to rationalise their unscrupulous subject matter by embracing and exploring their roots in junk, trash and exploitation cinema (hence Tarantino's fondness for these films, and his homage, Inglorious Basterds). Indeed, it's an understanding of their debased roots that make fare like Inglorious Basterds and The Dirty Dozen so interesting. Dozen, for example, is implicitly about both the perversion of cinematic justice and the impossibility of honour, and goes out of its way to show how evil exists, not mysteriously in the hearts of Nazis, but in complicit men, women and soldiers on both sides.But even if one switches off the brain, The Guns of Navarone fails as a mindless action movie. Actors Gregory Peck, David Niven, Anthony Quinn and James Darren turn in some wooden, stiff performances, and though director J. Lee Thompson's action scenes are sudden, violent and brutal, the film is ponderously slow when the bullets aren't flying.6.9/10 &#x96; This film needs some Lee Marvin, Charles Bronson, Clint Eastwood and Terry Savalas.

Surprisingly enough; when I saw it as a kid I thought of it only as an adventure movie, but when I see it as an adult it comes of more as a serious war-picture, because despite the light comedy of David Niven (in one of his most memorable roles) this is a brutal picture, at times almost hard to swallow.(MILD SPOILER, not regarding the ending)The Germans come of quite sympathetic, especially compared to the heroes after they assassinate the films true victim-of-war because the person (with a background as a school-teacher) buckled under torture. When you have seen the scene you might say there was no other way, I say they could have used the same way on this person as they did to some Germans they tied up and gagged earlier in the film. When the people we are supposed to root for executes this person in cold blood it puts a damper on the rest of the movie. Sure, war IS Hell, and tough choices like this works in a number of movies, but here it is almost too much, and hits you straight in the face like a wet towel, at least in the manner it is told.On top of this scene, Gregory Peck - the most sympathetic guy in Hollywood - even comes off as almost unsympathetic at times! At one key moment in the film Niven has had it and yells to hell with the job! I've been on a hundred jobs and not one of them has altered the course of the war! I don't care about the war anymore, I care about Roy! These feelings should hit close to home with most audience-members, as they have rarely been put in a life-or-death situation where you have to put all human emotions aside like Peck demands of his men. So when Niven later in the film actually apologizes to Peck for not being the cold-blooded killer he apparently wants him to be, it just feels entirely wrong! You should have told him to shove it where the sun don't shine, David.(END OF SPOILER)These points adds somewhat of a damper on an otherwise solid picture I really loved as a kid, but find harder to truly enjoy as I grow older. Go figure.This was supposed to be a user comment filled with praise, but given that this is one of the most praised-about and popular films from the 1960's I think it would have no problems withstanding my remarks, as it has stood the test of time and still is one of the greatest World War 2-movies ever made.

It's a war movie, yes, but with a very specific focus--the mission to destroy the big guns in Navarone.The film is necessarily impressive. It has physicality, it is willing to go dark at night, and broad in wide horizon landscapes, and yet the interiors have foreground and background and aren't just pretty. In color, it manages to keep a menacing tone, and yet is beautiful, a really nicely photographed job (by Oswald Morris, a British pro). Officially an American production, The Guns of Navarone is by and about a British war intervention. Director J. Lee Thompson (also British) is famous above all for one film, the original Cape Fear, but in terms of directorial management (and difficulty), this one is even more impressive. Gregory Peck (an American) plays a man who was, in real life, from New Zealand. He's a model of command and strength, in one of his best manly roles (easier said than done, being in charge of a bunch of tough guys and seeming legit, and not just theatrical.) David Niven is also in good form, playing a slightly prissy soldier, and he gives a smart, pointed speech near the end that's quotable stuff. Famously, Niven almost died from illness during the shooting (caused by some of the water scenes). Anthony Quinn as always is uncompromising.This is high stakes, high adventure stuff, masculine and hardened, but necessary in a brutal early part of the war. There are times when you think the Germans should have got them, as the good guys were too exposed, and the Germans too close, for escape. But most of the time it's gritty and realistic, and pretty amazing for how it creates the interlayering of civilian reality and war time heroics. It's set on a beautiful Greek island, luckily for the filmmakers, and for the film. And there are scenes of terrific storms, bucolic weddings, snowfall in the mountains, some serious night rock climbing (in the rain), on and on, in graphic widescreen photography, first rate stuff all around. The sets (in particular the gun installation) are big and impressive, just in themselves. I didn't expect to especially like the movie mostly because it sounded like another adventure war film, but it sucked me in by its sheer competence, by its earthy acting, and by the complex and involving plot. All of this is odd because I had read the book as a kid and was utterly enthralled at the time. It's good boy daydream stuff, and still is, for older boys in their fifties.

Gregory Peck is very good here. This might be David Niven's best film role and this is one of the very few times Anthony Quinn and Anthony Quayle are together in one movie. Both of them did a lot of solid films but rarely are they any better than in this one. James Darren, later to become a teen idol during the 1960's is here. Irene Papas has an important role along with Gia Scala though the ladies are not the main characters. Gia is important because her being Greek in a story set in Greece helps get the feel of reality.This film was important because not only was there sequels launched by it, but the concept of this film was used in several other films as well in the 1960's. Never were any done better than this one here. This one with a mission that seems impossible, yet so real in it's goal to secure the straight by the island of Navarone so that many ships in the royal navy are not sunk by these huge guns feels right in every aspect to a first time viewer.This movie does present the Nazi's as a very intelligent and capable foe. Their spy network seems to be ahead of the team every step of the way until very late in the movie. There i a very credible storm sequence that nearly derails the mission which is sort of a mini event that later would be expanded into the disaster type films of the late 1960's and beyond.

I am guessing that Mallory, a world famous climber was named in honour of George Mallory of Everest fame. A small team of experts are sent to totally destroy two massive guns built into the cliff top of a small Greek island. Time is important as they have to save the lives of 2,000 men trapped on another island who are about to be attacked by an overwhelming force. The only route for 5 destroyers is past the guns. I am now going to have to criticise the premise of this classic film. Why would the Germans put these massive guns in the middle of the Aegean sea just in case? Why couldn't the ships just pick another route which did not go past the guns ? The 2,000 men were not all going to die. If overwhelmed, they always had the option of surrender.

In WWII Greece, Peck plays a soldier recruited by Quayle to take part in a daring, nearly suicidal, mission to destroy a pair of massive guns that are cutting off rescue efforts of some 2000 men being cornered on a nearby island. Filling out the team are demolitions expert Niven, Greek resistance fighter Quinn, proved killer Baker and hotheaded Darren. They are later joined by two female, Greek, underground agents, Scala and Papas. Just getting to the area from which to mount the plan proves treacherous in itself, especially when Quayle is severely injured and has to be carried the rest of the way. There's a daunting mountain climb, a severe thunderstorm and shipwreck and a dangerous jaunt across a rocky valley as planes drop mortar from overhead. When the team is finally in place to begin the demolition, it seems that the problems they've encountered (including an arrest by the Nazis) have turned out to be more than just a coincidence. With the odds now even more extreme, they press on to destroy the title guns and allow the retrieval of the stranded men. Peck is stalwart and resourceful in his role, though there are occasions during which he is permitted to act far too over-emphatically, even coming off as foolish, such as when he tears into Niven during one of their respites. Niven is handed some of the rare pithy lines and manages to develop a rather three-dimensional character out of the situation. Quinn does a fine job, though he, too, hams it up every once in a while, though at least his turn seems intentional (as part of a scheme to fool the S.S.) Quayle is typically strong, adding texture and authenticity to his role. Baker and Darren play rather stock characters, each getting a moment or two to shine, with Baker probably getting the best of the deal. Notable actors Justice and Harris turn up briefly at the beginning to set the stage for the events to follow. If one were to insist on inserting two females into the story, as was done here, he could do much worse than Scala and Papas. Scala is a bit too made up for her part, but does an admirable job and Papas is extremely earthy and believable in her role. The ladies have one very memorable moment together about ¾'s of the way through. Named by many as their favorite adventure or war film, it was never really intended to be the serious piece of cinema that it seems to have become in retrospect. The stars were merely out to make an impressive action flick. However, in light of how bubble-gum (and bubble-headed) and slap-dash subsequent adventure movies have become, it can't help but be thought of in a different light now. Still, even director Thompson wished, in retrospect, that he'd trimmed up a few of the longish scenes. The film comes close, at times, to wearing out its welcome as it clocks in at over 2-1/2 hours. Several sequences stand out as memorable including the shipwreck (in which the actors were tormented with thousands of gallons of water), the revelation of the hidden enemy and the demolition of the guns. A sequel (generally considered inferior) came out seventeen years later called Force 10 From Navarone.

I'm adding Gregory Peck to my list of favorite actors, having seen him now a number of times in To Kill A Mockingbird and as Johnny Ringo in The Gunfighter, along with a handful of other films. Peck's character, Captain Keith Mallory, becomes the nominal leader of a band of soldiers on a mission to take out a pair of radar controlled guns on a Greek island protecting access to the Aegean Sea. If they fail, two thousand British soldiers will die in a Nazi show of force intended to bring Turkey into the war on the side of the Axis Powers.This is the kind of movie made at a time when you just knew what the outcome would be, so the excitement had to be in the way you got to the finish line. The story here is a well crafted one, even if some elements defy credibility after the fact. Such as 'Butcher' Brown's (Stanley Baker) reluctance to use fatal force to reckon with an enemy, thereby casting some doubt as to his nickname. Or the motivation of the traitor Anna (Gia Scala) once she reunited with her friend Maria (Irene Pappas) and fell in league with the Navarone team. Those issues were glossed over rather quickly if not very convincingly, but they weren't enough to defuse the intensity of the story.The best scenes had to do with one on one confrontations presenting a moral dilemma, like the early scene when Major Franklin (Anthony Quayle) faced down another officer over the fate of the laundry boy. Even better and more intense was the showdown over Anna between Mallory and Corporal Miller (David Niven). The scene presented no other choice for Mallory than to do his duty, for which he was spared by the intervention of Maria Pappadimos, a clever twist inserted by the screenplay. The best ruse though had to do with Mallory's planting a false lead with the severely injured Franklin, a plot element virtually indispensable if the mission were to succeed.The other thing that kept one's interest aside from the Navarone mission was the unfinished business between Mallory and his former friend and ally Andrea Stavros (Anthony Quinn). Again, one has a sense that they'll settle their score favorably, but it's always in the back of the viewer's mind as to how that scenario will play out.For a film that doesn't have to rely on lighter moments, I got a kick out of David Niven's mid film Heil, everybody!

Irene Papas and Anthony Quayle have secondary roles but they also acquit themselves well. This is a war-time suspense film, a squad of men dispatched to accomplish a near impossible mission in a very brief amount of time. Considering that the film is quite long, maintaining the suspense is no mean feat and it is accomplished extremely well though by means of a number of utterly implausible plot twists. The actors establish their characters early in the movie and maintain them to the very end -- though a deadly enmity between Peck's character and Quinn's is resolved a bit too conveniently at the conclusion of the film.

Well, it probably doesn't help that they send Miller to Yugoslavia with a valise, and end up taking Carl Weathers along for no reason whatsoever. This is always a bad sign of things to come. Perhaps the worst sequel ever, the sequel to THE DIRTY DOZEN, also used the implausible device of sending a black soldier behind German lines during WW II to complete a mission. In that movie in particular, where the plan was to infiltrate Germany dressed as German soldiers, one would think that a black operator would be a liability. While I think Carl Weathers is great, I just can't imagine his character thinking that going on a suicide mission to Yugoslavia would be an improvement over spending a couple of nights in the brig.

Movies such as Where Eagles Dare, Kelly's Heroes and The Eagle Has Landed. They were always carefully made with lots of eye for entertainment and had a star-filled cast, with wonderful actors. This movie is right up there with the very best and most entertaining adventurous WW II movies. The sentence; 'they don't make them like this anymore', certainly applies here.The movie has a wonderful adventurous and heroic story about a small group of Allied soldiers who are send on a mission to destroy two enormous guns at a small Greek island, in order to make the evacuation by sea of 2000 fellow Allied soldiers at a nearby island succeed. Of course lots of things go wrong and lots of action occurs. They get into some serious situations but often also manage to get out of it, thanks to some often unlikely but always entertaining occurrence. Yes, the story is certainly one of the biggest reasons why this movie is a very great and especially memorable one. The story is based on the novel by Alistair MacLean, who of course knew how to write an entertaining, adventurous WW II story.But probably the main reason why this movie is regarded as being an absolute classic, is due to the cast. There are some impressive and much respected names out of the business present in this movie. Gregory Peck was one of the best actors who ever lived and further more the movie has Anthony Quinn and David Niven in the most significant roles. Every actor in the movie plays an interesting character. The story is mainly set around the small group of 6 Allied soldiers whose mission it is to destroy the guns of Navarone. Every character is deliciously stereotypical and has his very own specialty. The characters suit in perfectly with the adventurous and entertaining story. The actors that portray them make their characters even more enjoyable and great to watch. Gregory Peck is a great leading man and he has some great chemistry with especially Anthony Quinn. David Niven plays the sort of comic relief and his character has got some of the best lines of the movie.It's sort of too bad that the movie had two prominent female characters in it. Nothing wrong with female emancipation in war movies but the characters need to serve a significant purpose. The movie could had easily done without the female characters and to be honest it makes the movie perhaps drag a little on at points, due to some needless slow sequences. Basically this movie is one of those typical ultimate man movies, in which female characters should have no part in. It just didn't feel fitting. No offense ladies, I still love you!The movie is long but the pace is high, thanks to the nimble editing and lots of action filled sequences that are present in the movie. It makes The Guns of Navarone a delightful 158 minutes that provides almost non-stop entertainment and action.The movie has some great looking settings and the action sequences are well directed and brought to the screen. It gives the movie a sort of an epic feeling overall. The unforgettable musical score by Dimitri Tiomkin also certainly does add to the movie its epic and adventurous feeling.One of the earliest- and also best and most entertaining WW II movies.9/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Choice of Mallory is interesting.","Date":"11 September 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":"  The movie, based on Alastair MacLean's book, I would assume uses the same names as the book (I have never read the book).

This is interesting because another Mallory, in real life George Leigh Mallory, was also one of the greatest mountain climbers of all time who lost his life along with Sandy Irvine during the British expedition to climb Mt.

Still missing is a camera which the two climbers had with them which may have recorded their summit of Mt. Everest 29 years before Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay.

Which without intending to be snooty I've done many times over the decades; it's just some people actually prefer concentrating on a smaller screen with no one munching popcorn in their ear.An Allied mission comprising of six big strong men sets out to destroy the gargantuan Nazi guns entrenched in the cliffs at Navarone in Greece. This mission is to be by sea, mountain and land and faces many trials and tribulations along the way caused by the Nazis and internal frictions. The moral relativist dilemmas come thick and fast and are what help make this a special war film &#x96; at the other end of the decade there was no such moralising in Where Eagles Dare. Examples whether or not to kill or kill to order; the possibility of using up a man's life to further your own ends or orders; instead of holding doors open for them should men shoot women; how tough it is to make decisions which effect others; why the two not so intelligent working class men were doomed to die and the three intelligent upper class officers destined to survive; what bloody good does any of it do anyway; and surprisingly more. On the evidence presented it's even possible to debate whether the Nazis really did have a shocking taste in undies. My favourite bit is David Niven's dramatic unmasking of the traitor and what he expects from his commanding officer Gregory Peck in resolution &#x96; everyone's emotions are expertly played with, including ours.There's (generally) great acting, production and story &#x96; the special effects are sometimes a disappointment but aren't a problem as never central to the plot.

If that wasn't enough then the cast list of Peck , Niven and Quinn for an American audience and Robertson-Justice and Baker who between must have appeared in every single British film in the late 1950s would have appealed to the Brits . What could fail ? Not much admittedly but there's something old fashioned about this movie which tries a little bit too hard too be epic and this is reflected in the way the story is padded out . It seems it's too simplistic on the part of the film makers that a team of daring commandos have a dangerous mission and the film makers constantly have them facing danger every ten minutes . It's a similar problem that would plague the James Bond franchise where the title hero has to face impossible odds regardless whether the logic behind it makes any sense Actually there is a lack of if not logic then certainly explanation to much of the film .

Rather than attempting a frontal assault, a small team of six Brits and Greeks are ordered to infiltrate the island by boat and blow up the cannons. We follow them as they narrowly survive mother nature and encounters with Germans and along the way their dispositions toward the mission and each other change.Like I said, this film has aged&#x85;mostly well. There are a lot of things that you can't really watch with a straight face. Peck's acting is a bit hammy at times and the way the tension between Peck and Quinn's characters is resolved is as symbolic as me shouting in your ear is subtle, but overall, this film manages to excel in terms of action without disregarding character development as so many modern-day action flicks tend to do.According to the trivia section on IMDb, Gregory Peck was disappointed by how many viewers failed to properly identify Navarone as anti-war and though I can understand his frustration, I think this has more to do with the style of the film than the intended message. When I think 'anti-war', I think of films like Kubrick's Paths of Glory with its clearly delineated anti-war morals. Navarone however, is first and foremost a bundle of (exciting) action set pieces. Of course there is drama, some of it still really effective, but the film's many action sequences are crucial as they define the film as just that &#x96; an action film &#x96; because these scenes tend to lack some sense of symbolism, underlying the futility of war, etc. In other words, there's anti-war stuff to be found here, but it's overshadowed by the amount of Hollywood spectacle.In the end, not every war film needs to be an in-your-face anti-war ad. The Guns of Navarone is first and foremost an exciting adventure film, excelling at many of the tropes that have made the genre popular. Even 50 years later, Navarone has a lot of replay value and (though occasionally campy) is still fun to watch and genuinely exciting.

The Guns of Navarone does plod in the pace a tad at times and some of the camera work and special effects look under-budgeted and silly now compared to the rest of the production values(the script and score were in my view more deserving of an Oscar win, but were up against stiff competition that year). The Guns of Navarone does boast atmospheric scenery, expressive lighting that gives the film a haunting but not obvious look and mostly skilled photography, so while not a great-looking film regardless of some camera work and effects it's a good-looking one. Dmitri Tiomkin's justifiably Oscar-nominated and Golden Globe-winning music score is stirring in the very best of ways and sets the atmosphere and what the characters are thinking brilliantly. It is sometimes used sparingly but that really works here, considering what's going on. The film is very intelligently scripted in a way that's easy to understand and does a great job developing the characters, who are compellingly real, not black and white and are ones that we really get to know, especially David Niven's. It was nice to see the Germans as formidable yet human instead of being one-sided. The story is told with a great deal of tension, realism and suspense that are maintained throughout the long(two and a half hours) length, some of the many suspenseful scenes being without music or dialogue and just sound effects(nail-biting ones too), The Guns of Navarone really does have to have some of the best use of silence of any film. The story's tone shifts are done smoothly and not in a way that's awkward or bizarre, it has a strong message not done in a over-didactic way and the ending is gut-wrenching. The pace plods here and there but mostly is very efficient and actually with the characters and story being as engrossing as they were the film never to me became a bore. The direction is sympathetic to the action but manages to inject life into the storytelling and sustain the amount of tension and suspense there is, giving it all space to develop. The cast were great on paper and their acting is even greater, the acting honours going to David Niven in a smooth, witty and touching performance as the most interesting and well-developed character of the film. Gregory Peck can be wooden but he's anything but here, he may not pass for British but his command of the screen and his rapport with Niven more than compensates. And you cannot go wrong with Stanley Baker, Anthony Quayle, Anthony Quinn, Irene Papas, James Darren and James Robertson-Justice, all fine here especially a very humorous Quinn. Only Richard Harris disappointed, a little stiff and with a pretty appalling accent. On the whole, while not the greatest wartime drama(the granddaddy of them is still 1930's All Quiet on the Western Front) the Guns of Navarone is great stuff and a near-classic. 9/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"A tough-minded military espionage film","Date":"19 June 2013","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":" The Guns of Navarone places a group of hard-boiled Allied saboteurs into scenarios that require them to put their civilian instincts for compassion aside for the sake of the mission. Whole other, milder, happier lives seem implicit in these characters' sad glances and careful movements, and Gregory Peck and Anthony Quayle in particular convey with great subtlety that their characters would rather be comfortably behind desks&#x97;not to preserve their own safety, which they put unhesitatingly at risk, but to prevent them from having to make difficult decisions about the lives of other members of their top-secret team. The casting of well-known, likable actors such as David Niven, Gregory Peck, and Anthony Quinn is essential for the impact of the story's cloak-and-dagger twists, in which agonizing personal decisions and private anxieties are brought to the fore. The Nazis are of course fearful villains, especially in a tense interrogation scene, and their heavy gun emplacement targeted for sabotage makes for a great set piece backdrop, but in a departure from other war films of the period these elements are almost a sideshow here. At the heart of the film instead are the dynamics within the Allied infiltration team itself, and the team's efforts to navigate, in good faith, the situations that require them to regard as expendable anyone who threatens the success of the mission&#x97;including injured or untrustworthy members of their own team. These personalized stakes make Navarone among the most tense and uncompromising war movies I've seen.

This is not a stretch since NAVARONE was a monster hit in 1961, snagged an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture, and has maintained a huge following among male moviegoers ever since.And until recently, NAVARONE was one of the few of the great epic war movies I had never seen all the way through from beginning to end. Watching NAVARONE today is to be transported back to a time when World War II was well within the living memory of every adult, including the youthful John F. Kennedy, who had just been inaugurated President; when that conflict still dominated the popular culture. The plot is quite simple a small group of commandos will infiltrate German occupied Greece and destroy the huge artillery weapons that prevent the rescue of two thousand stranded British troops on an island in the Aegean Sea. The mission has the be accomplished within a specific window of time or a Royal Naval relief force will be sunk before the British soldiers can be rescued.The men whose job it falls to take out the heavily fortified guns- Mallory, Miller, Stavros, Brown, Franklin-are hard bitten veterans; cynical pros who know how to get it done despite any and all roadblocks in the way. These men are the grandfathers of the characters Stallone, Willis and Statham would portray decades later. They're not patriots in the flag waving sense of the word, but men willing to get their hands dirty because they know that will save the lives of other men like themselves.The mission itself is a trek over sea through dangerous waters and up a sheer cliff; full of narrow escapes from the Germans and betrayal by a supposed ally. There is never a moment during the mission when you are not completely aware of the danger the commandos are in from the Nazis. The pacing is perfect, allowing the heroes (and the viewer) just enough time to catch their breath between narrow escapes and unforeseen obstacles. The climax has edge of your seat suspense as the cannons are readied to sink the British ships as the heroes race to blow them up with not a second to spare. NAVARONE is a great showcase for a style movie acting that has long passed. Gregory Peck, David Niven and Anthony Quinn were men who played men, not buffed up action stars; there is a maturity about the way they handle themselves that tells us their characters have been through a lot and done worse. All three men were at the peak of their very long careers when they made NAVARONE. Peck's Mallory is the epitome of resourceful competence, and his confrontation with Niven's Corporal Miller over the fate of Franklin, where both of these tough men reveal something of themselves, is the film's dramatic highlight. Great dialog and great movie star acting. Quinn's ruthless Stavros could easily be a cousin to his Zorba; both characters get to fall in love with Irene Papas.There are some great supporting performances by Stanley Baker and Anthony Quayle, two British actors who've been forgotten now that they've been gone from the scene for many years. Baker would go on to star in ZULU, another great war movie; while Quayle would join the other Anthony the next year in David Lean's LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, a classic that surpasses even NAVARONE. There is a connection between Bond and NAVARONE actor Walter Gotell, who would go on to play the head of the KGB in a slew of 007 films, has a significant role as a Nazi officer.One of the things that does date the film concerns the unmasking of the traitor in their ranks when the time comes to dole out rough justice, Irene Papas steps in and executes her at the last minute instead of Peck's Mallory. It seems that in a movie made in 1961, it just wouldn't do to have Gregory Peck shoot an unarmed woman in cold blood, even if she has sold him out to the Nazis. But things changed fast, only a few years later, American soldiers would slaughter German men and women without a second thought in THE DIRTY DOZEN. The era of the epic war movie, of which THE GUNS OF NAVARONE is a shinning example, began with the release of THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAII in 1957 and along the way we got such classics as THE GREAT ESCAPE, THE LONGEST DAY, THE DIRTY DOZEN, WHERE EAGLES DARE, and continued through PATTON in 1970, before the genre went out of fashion during the Vietnam era. I guess movies like NAVARONE, which even at its most cynical, still suggested that war could be an adventure, rang hollow in time of Kent State and My Lai. But the war movie has never really gone away despite whatever politics of the time; the end of the 70's would bring the Vietnam epics like THE DEER HUNTER and APOCALYPSE NOW, and later there would be SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, THREE KINGS, BLACK HAWK DOWN,and THE HURT LOCKER. But these would be conflicts with no place for Peck, Niven, or Quinn and the kind of professionals they portrayed. Yet the spirit of THE GUNS OF NAVARONE is alive and well in the 21st century; just watch INGLORIOUS BASTERDS and see what I mean. I'd bet Brad Pitt's Lieutenant Aldo Rane would enjoy having a drink with Captain Keith Mallory and Colonel Andrea Stavros.

Modern action flicks tend to be so crammed with special effects and characters capable of super-human feats that 'The Guns Of Navarone' seems pedestrian by comparison. The good news is that although this movie entails a team of 'experts', we can still identify with them all. They're still ordinary, just good at their jobs in a way almost anyone might be.If you can overlook the preposterous crash-landing at the outset and the bombers hanging motionless above the airfield, then the rest is child's play. Gregory Peck is asked to lead a team through treacherous waters, to an equally treacherous cliff. As a mountaineer, his job is to get the rest of the team on top. After that, Anthony Quayle will lead the assault on two lethal guns mounted in a massive and impenetrable bunker on the Greek island of Navarone. It's impossible, of course. It's Alistair MacClean.Action comes thick and fast. From every quarter they're up against it. And they need to get a move on too. A couple of thousand British soldiers will be slaughtered if they fail. That, and a flotilla of destroyers sent to rescue them will be sunk by the guns. Although, as I say, the story moves at a pedestrian pace by modern action movie standards, it is skilfully timed for all that. There are sufficient quiet interludes too, enabling a more detailed character study to be offered. Still; a German E-boat vanishes in moments. A 'tidal' wave wrecks their fishing boat. They lose half their kit and Quayle's character gets a broken leg, leaving Peck to take charge. And of course; there's a traitor in their midst. they are harried by Stukas, and captured by the Gestapo.There's the usual wartime clichés of the period. Germans are as daft as brushes. They are slaughtered without mercy. What is different is that the Germans themselves are generally depicted as less brutal than the British team.There are one or two cheesy bits and plot inconsistencies. For example, Germans are killed by knife despite a silenced handgun providing a much quicker and risk-free solution. There are also one or two subtle, atmospheric moments. Most of the camera-work is excellent, as is the lighting. Darkness actually looks genuine. Sets are believable, with plenty of location work. The cliff looks bogus at times, and there are one or two evidently 'studio' takes in the mountains. Otherwise there is a genuine sense of place. Sound effects are also adequate for its age. A sub-woofer certainly pays dividends.A top-drawer cast of the period includes Gregory Peck, David Niven - uncharacteristically playing a cynic, Anthony Quayle, Anthony Quinn, Stanley Baker & James Robertson-Justice. They lend gravitas to what is otherwise a routine McClean script.The ending includes a reprise of all the characters to a romantic theme which is needless and cheesy, but otherwise this plot is Maclean's second-best actioner, surpassed only by 'Where Eagles Dare'. Even then it's a lot more straightforward and believable.Still highly recommended.

In terms of actual action, a film like this demands a series of peaks and troughs so that once every ten or twelve minutes there should be something memorable action-wise but here it was something of a one-trick pony so that the feeling was the budget was being spent on the final (theoretical) spectacular explosion but in the event it proved to be something of a damp squib.

Unfortunately that's the effect Hollywood has on many an audience member.

It's not often you see somebody try a lot of exposition in a scene like that and succeed. Then Gregory Peck went out to go down to the hold and saw rocks ahead.What follows is the most awesome man against nature and shipwreck sequence I have ever seen in a movie. Period. And nobody ever mentions it in reviews? Weird. They did win an Oscar for effects, though, so it didn't go totally unrecognized.That feeling we get for the men and the team during this storm keeps them at the center of our focus for the rest of the movie, and it keeps us moving forward with all the intricate plot twists, complications, and surprises that are to come. I really liked that.It wasn't worth a 10 because some major character shifts were a little unbelievable (Peck's sudden anger after a really buttoned down, almost wooden performance, especially, but also Darren's character's transformations from killer to brother to killer again were too abrupt and kind of took me out of the movie); also, they never showed the men carrying the supplies up the cliff, which was a little jarring after they had shown the men laboriously retrieving the supplies from the sinking ship.But that's all my complaint. There are many other good parts to the movie, including the pacing, the filming, and the plot, which is never lost. This is a war movie and an action movie, but what really keeps you at the edge of your seat is the human drama involved here. They're balanced wonderfully well, and that is rare, too.Also, this is David Niven as you might never have seen him before, gritty and yet superficial, with some sort of seething anger underneath it all that finally comes to the surface when somebody tampers with his beloved chemicals (though his character vents his anger elsewhere, in the process proving to everybody, first that there is a traitor among them, and then who it is). Peck forces him to get serious (perhaps for the first time in his life) and go all out to prove his genius. Then near the very end, the way Niven lets go of the rope to fall into the sea just expresses something profound and lovable about his character.Well worth seeing. As for the whole antiwar bit? I don't think so. The movie doesn't gloss over the tough decisions in no-win decisions or the incredible and seemingly meaningless (at the time) loss of life, but that's just honesty. Also, I particularly liked the way the German soldiers were portrayed as complex human beings, not cardboard bad guys. Nonetheless, as they have Peck point out, somebody's got to take responsibility, and there is a job that must be done, and that requires violence or the threat of violence more often than not in the movie. It's not glorified, and that was a change in the depiction of war on hit films back in the 1960s. That's not the same thing as antiwar, though. M*A*S*H was antiwar, not The Guns of Navarone.

But he had to withdraw troops from the struggle against Rommel in North Africa and it left the British troops there behind the eight ball. The fight in the Balkans was hopeless from the beginning and the Brits had a heck of a time getting their troops evacuated. Many went into the bag.That's all true, but there was never a mission to take out guns at Navarone. Nevertheless, this is an entertaining and even gripping war film because it shows combat the way WE like to think of it. Lots of professionalism and self sacrifice on our part, but in the end we win. And that's that.Five men are chosen to make a nearly suicidal attempt to blow up a couple of huge Nazi cannons secreted away in the cliffs of the island of Navarone. They can't be bombed out. And they dominate the only route to the major British evacuation point, preventing destroyers and transports from reaching the beleaguered Brits.The men are all hand picked pros. Gregory Peck becomes the leader of the pack. Why? Because he speaks Greek like a Greek, German like a German, is a champion mountain climber, is handsome and sincere, is a major Hollywood star, and has memorized the Encyclopedia Brittanica from aardvark to zzemblya. Ex-professor David Niven is the explosives expert. Stanley Baker is a master with a knife. Anthony Quinn is a devoted Greek patriot. Anthony Quayle is the organizer who knows the ins and outs of the mission. James Darrin is there because he is a born killer from the streets of an American city and was a heart throb at the time. He gets to sing a song in Greek. He can't sing. There are two women thrown into the mix later -- the relentless Irene Papas with her Salma Hayeck eyebrows and her Parabellum MP 38, and green-eyed Gia Scala who brings a delicate carnality to the role.There isn't room enough here to describe all the travails of this expedition. Maybe even a book couldn't do a proper job. The expectable clichés are embedded in the plot. Leave me behind and save yourselves. This officer is the good German. Which one of us is a traitor? One of our guys can knock off a dozen of yours. And then, at the climax, an orgasmic explosion, the biggest, most stupendous, colossal, monumental, mastadonic, mountainous, volcanic, pythonic, macrocephalic, Brobdignagian explosion ever committed to celluloid.This thing is practically an icon of vernacular culture. There was never anything quite so BIG before, though there had been plenty of stories of small, heroic groups on near-suicidal altruistic missions in wartime.And some philosophical considerations of ethics and other issues are bootlegged in. Mad Magazine printed a parody of it. Peck and Niven are in the cave holding the guns, arguing about the pointlessness of war. They must plant the detonators that will blow up the guns. On the other side of the steel door, a hundred German soldiers are pounding and burning their way through the metal. Their drill bits are auguring inward. Seconds count. Niven exclaims, Do you REALLY think mankind is worth saving? Peck pauses thoughtfully and firmly replies, YES AND NO. The debate goes on as the Germans pour in.Well -- if you haven't yet seen it, you must, if only for Dmitri Tiompkin's score with its cowbells and triangles, almost matching the bombast of the images. The images, by the way, are evocative and quite pretty. And, to be honest, Tiompkin's score is subdued by his standards.

Then I saw it again as an adult and I was surprised at how dumb the plot is, how unrealistic the action and how stupid the resident Germans are. It's still a fun movie to watch, mind you, but to fully enjoy it one have to, either be a complete ignorant in military matters or someone capable of making a giant effort of suspension of disbelief. If you can't fit in one of these two cases then don't waste your time.For starters, Old Winny would have never given the go-ahead to such hare-brained plan, as he knew well that a crucial part of winning wars is the optimum allocation of resources, which at times will go against humanitarian impulses. After losing a few Lancasters he would have simply told the threatened Tommies to give up and gingerly go marching to the POW camp where they would have been treated quit decently anyway as the brits, under Hitler's orders, were the only Allied POWs to be treated according to Geneva. He would have never risked six of his by then precious DDs, the best team in the business and a big chunk of the Greek Resistance just to get them out specially when he had a whole empire from where to draw all the needed cannon fodder. And if he had done so, after all, at the news the entire German High Command would have, first laughed their arses off and then devised a simple plan allowing the team to reach Navarone unencumbered, only to get them when it would be too late for the DDs to turn back. That's what the Germans would have done--as they did many times--instead of running all over the place like headless chickens. And how absurd is the idea that, to impress Turkey with a show of force Hitler would send the cream of his war machine to a place of no military value to roughen up 2000 exhausted and helpless brits, as JRJ says it in the intro? So, we're not talking Kursk here, or the Bulge.But not only the plot is fantasy, the day to day action is too. It's unbelievable that a German gunboat bristling with guns and crewed by well trained machine gunners could have gone down in seconds when faced with a dinghy with men armed with light weaponry. And even if that had happened, just minutes later these men would have had to deal with the Luftwaffe--remember, that ship wasn't alone there. German soldiers would have never come marching into that square like scouts in a parade, as one, or all, in the team could have decided to go kamikaze in case they were caught, and blow themselves up carrying with them a few enemies. Instead, they would have taken positions on the roofs, barricaded the streets, etc. And when the team was caught its members would have been promptly tied, blindfolded and thrown at the bottom of separate trucks to be handed to the Gestapo. The scene with the two German officers is laughable and so is Quinn's bit; Stavrou would have never had the chance to pull his act in real life (but what the heck, it's 1961, there's a Cold War going on, West Germany is now a friend, so let's include a good German here).As the plot unfolds the unlikely facts pile up. These Germans are not just stupid but helpful too&#x97;ex the guy who tells his mate to pull the curtains over the bunker's window just as Mallory, Miller, walk by. Or the fact that no one's standing guards in the fortress, inside or outside it; not even a lone armed guard. Even worse, that cave doesn't even have an emergency entry&#x97;-in case the steel doors are blocked in place by a RAF bomb for ex. The Germans have no plan B whatsoever in case they're denied for any reason access to the guns! Just bring in the blowtorches! And what about a fortress that got an alarm system to detect intruders but no system at all for stopping them?. The acting is decent but it's hard to sympathize with any of these characters. Peck et al do a good job, but Niven is pretty annoying when he plays out his drama queen number. I wonder if those who made GON intended to make any of these people likable, as no one is to me. And whatever sympathy I may have felt it was gone when they murdered the girl. That was pure cold blooded murder; there was no reason for it--they could have just left her there, tied up. From then on I couldn't care less if they all got killed. I kept watching just for the action. BTW, I don't know where Peck got the idea that this is an anti-war movie. Just because two guys keep b...ing about how tired they are of the killing..? Puh-leese.I should give it a 4, but I grant it 2 bonus points, 'cause it requires a lot of skill to get away with such a fairy tale disguised as a war flick.

Director J. Lee Thompson has created a taut adventurous tale about a dangerous mission (almost dangerously impossible in my view) that is carried out despite several drawbacks along the way.It's these drawbacks that seem typically fictional in nature--and a strain on credibility in the way they are smoothed over by the rugged individuals who deal with every impossible situation with such precise action. Indeed, the final scenes where they reach their destination to blow up the enemy artillery, are enough to make anyone skeptical about their handling of all the details involved in carrying out their scheme and how perfectly each obstacle is overcome.But aside from that, this is a good WWII adventure tale about a mission impossible that keeps the viewer in suspense until the final explosive moments. All of the acting is credible enough to overcome any difficulty you might have with some of the plot situations.Peck is particularly interesting as the doubtful leader and David Niven is equally compelling as the explosives expert at odds with Peck's leadership.Summing up Taut, tense and exciting thriller which won an Oscar for its special effects.

With these solid performances and terrific bursts of action as well as some very impressive 1960s special effects, audience members more than willingly allow credibility to go out the window and let the sheer entertainment value of the movie overwhelm them. It's about a (fictional) story of a group of World War II soldiers who are given the task to approach a cliff-sided town of Navarone, controlled by the Germans. The British navy cannot attack the coast on account of two very cliff-mounted large cannons, the titular guns of Navarone, that guard it. So it is up to this small group of men led by Gregory Peck to scale the cliff, invade the town, clear out any Germans that get in their way, and set charges that will destroy the cannons so that an approaching naval fleet can take over.Yes, if you are looking for a credible story, keep on the search, for The Guns of Navarone requires you to suspend your disbelief in the face of its plot. However, it is ten times as intelligent as half the action flicks I've seen come out in the past ten years and a hundred times as much fun. The movie sets up the plot right away and proceeds to become a quintessentially exciting WWII adventure. And that's the sheer fun of the movie. It's not simply a mission to blow up the guns. It's an adventure story, very much like a journey. The characters are very well-shaped and very well-acted and I was very pleased to see them portrayed by actors older than the conventional war movie leads. By casting older, more experienced actors, the filmmakers give us a sense of experienced soldiers, professionals on the job and they can be credible if the plot or circumstances they are placed in are not.And I cannot leave out the best thing in the movie &#x96; the action scenes. After a good setup and some exploitation across the sea, the movie introduces a very famous starting action moment that has been ripped-off, and parodied many times over the past forty-some years. And the energy of the action scenes only get better as the film progresses. The sound design, the cinematography, and the incredible special effects produce a tremendous level of excitement.The Guns of Navarone is a long movie. It stretches nearly three hours in length and I think it's maybe fifteen minutes too long, but that's hardly a detractor. Up to that point where I did check my watch out of curiosity, the movie sped along brilliantly as every good movie should. Now what makes The Guns of Navarone different from the mindless action flicks of today? They both lack credibility in terms of whether or not you can believe the plot. But the simple truth is The Guns of Navarone is fun, and most of today's flicks are not.

Ostensibly, this $7-million plus action blockbuster represented one of the earliest examples of the blockbuster World War II movie trend that Hollywood launched in the 1960s. The Longest Day, The Battle of the Bulge, The Great Escape, The Dirty Dozen, and Where Eagles Dare followed in the wake of the success of this sprawling Columbia Picture's release. High Noon scenarist Carl Foreman penned the screenplay from Alistair MacLean's bestselling novel about a group of intrepid commandos who are thrown in at the last-minute to spike a battery of giant radar controlled guns anchored in the bowels of a mountain overlooking the sea that British ships must ply to save a stranded army of soldiers. Repeated bombing missions against the guns have failed to destroy them, so British officer James Robertson Justice dispatches Gregory Peck, Anthony Quinn, David Niven, James Darren, Anthony Quayle, and Stanley Baker to perform this incredible feat against suicidal odds. Essentially, World War II movies from the 1950s, such as The Bridge on the River Kwai and The Dam Busters inspired these big films as much as Hollywood's desire to lure audiences into the theaters with movies about big events to combat the advent of television. Director J. Lee Thompson, who later helmed Cape Fear and Kings of the Sun, keeps our heroes leaping through a series of flaming hoops with several twists and turns. No sooner have our heroes embarked on their mission than they are pursued by the enemy in a way that means somebody has sold them out from the source. Thompson emphasizes thrills and chills while Foreman moralizes about warfare and killing. There are some memorable lines of dialogue and every performance is letter perfect. The tense finale inside the gun emplacement is spine-tingling with suspense as the Germans are banging on the doors while the heroes place explosive charges on the guns. The atmospheric cinematography of Oswald Morris, the snappy editing of Alan Osbiston, the stirring orchestral soundtrack of Dimitri Tiomkin, and the impressive production designs by Geoffrey Drake all contribute to the outstanding artistry of this film. My sole quibble is for the poor special effects that open the film as a crippled British bomber crashes at an Allied airfield while another bomber in the background appears to be hanging stationary in the skies. Apart from this single flaw, The Guns of Navarone is a terrific tough guys actioneer.

If you really want to see old acting fish out of water, watch In Harm's Way.The Hollywood generational war movie torch was passed around the time Kelly's Heros was made, with Clint Eastwood and cast coming from the Korean War era. Other movies at the time, like M*A*S*H and Catch-22 continued the trend of younger actors taking over. However, that generation fell off the age wagon, too. See Eastwood in Heartbreak Ridge and Lee Marvin in The Big Red One. Perhaps the movie of the era that did the best job of trying to match the believable ages of the characters and actors was The Young Lions, with Dean Martin, Marlin Brando and Montgomery Clift.Thank you UCLA Film School for the excellent restoration of The Guns of Navarone.

The film is incredibly staged looking which gives it an uncanny cheap feeling that prevents it from being any bit more than being some mindless entertainment. Typical for it's time, the Commandos in the film are played by actors who were far too old to be convincing. Usually I don't pay much attention to this, as I'm a big fan of John Wayne and I like the war films that he starred in in the late forties and fifties, but seeing the cast here which included Gregory Peck, David Niven and Anthony Quinn, that resulted in this film remaining for almost a year on my DVD shelf before I finally took it down the other day to watch. I knew what I was in for, because this really is nothing new. It's typical for it's time when hordes upon hordes of war films suffocating with adventure elements and over-the-top gung-ho heroism were being produced.It's 1943, and after their defeat at Stalingrad, the German's attempt to bully neutral Turkey into the war on the Axis side to participate in the Dodecanese Campaign where the Allies are attempting to take control of the islands in the Aegean sea. On a small island called Keros, 2,000 British soldiers are trapped and surrounded, and the Allies can't reach them due to the guns on Navarone that are preventing any Allied destroyers or planes from coming anywhere near the island. They have a week before the German army arrives to wipe out the British soldiers. A plan has been made to send a team of saboteurs to the island to destroy the guns, and heading this squad will be Captain Keith Mallory who is an expert climber. They will travel to Navarone where some members of the Greek resistance will wait for them and give them aid, and then they will attempt to destroy the guns and save the men trapped on Keros.I wouldn't even categorise this as a war film. It has the feel and look almost of a swash buckle adventure film without the swords. While it's based on a campaign of WW2 that's never really been touched before, it's still a terribly boring film that never really gets going. One of the most expensive films ever made at the time, it hasn't got a lot to show for this by using the cheap indoor sets for the cliff scenes that just make it look extremely amateurish. So it definitely does not hold up well today. I could go on but I've other films to review... But on one last note, Gregory Peck is awful in this. His presence on the screen is extremely distracting from the word go, showing up at the regimental headquarters wearing a pristine white suit, and sporting his American accent. It would have worked better if maybe he had attempted a British accent to make him sound more like a real British Commando. Apparently Peck was disappointed when people missed the anti-war message in the film. I'm sorry but I did too, all I could make out was a bunch of little boys playing John Wayne...

I mention this since the Guns of Navarone is not quite pro-war, but not anti-war as Gregory Peck thought it should be seen. It shows how people in an intense war-time engagement like the men on the mission in this film will have to do just about anything - even if it means the usual hero gets just close enough to the edge of being something else entirely (not quite, but you'll see the scene I'm talking about) - in order to carry out the end goal. It also shows what kind of man it might take to give up information easily to the enemy (or maybe not, as case turns out). And certainly watching your best buddies die is never something too satisfying. Hell, maybe the whole scope of the mission and its consequences are meant to teach a valuable lesson. Points taken... Then again, why is The Guns of Navarone so entertaining and invigorating that men from ages 5 to 95 want turn out and kick some ass after watching it? Well, it's probably because it falls into the camp of flicks like The Dirty Dozen and Kelly's Heroes (if not quite as funny) as a movie about Guys-on-a-Mission. In this case the mission is simple get behind enemy lines on the little island of Navarone, where damn giant guns (or rather cannons) are being used on allied warships and other targets, and destroy them to Hades. Of course, as one might expect, this is practically (if not just) a suicide mission, but the men- Gregory Peck, Anthony Quinn, David Nicen- all take up the cause to go and do it, along with their own few men who can just kill on a whim... that is, if they need to, such as with a knife or bare-hands.It could be called an anti-war film perhaps, but it's ultimately an action/adventure movie, and so in its own dimension, it does... make this look exciting and dangerous but the kind us in the audience who may have not gone to war can still get behind. It's realistic fantasy, if that makes sense, and while it's more for the guys I'm sure some women won't mind taking in the main stars (I mean, Anthony Quinn, come on). For all of the intense scenes, such as the cliff climbing during the storm or, of course, the tense climax, it takes a little while for the plot to really get going. It's this exposition one has to kind of just sit up and do the best to pay attention to, knowing full well the plot will take its inevitable twists and turns and we'll be informed on what's going on again anyway (sometimes by an actual maritime clock).Once it does, it keeps going as a relentless mission-flick, and there are two genuinely great scenes (maybe two of the best scenes in any war movie) one is when Anthony Quinn, in a line-up with his fellow British and Greek soldiers standing in front of irate Nazis, tries to get out of the lineup by saying he's just a poor fisherman. A trick, of course, though what's great about the scene (aside from Quinn's performance) is how you're not sure if he'll be taken outside for something and then find a way back in to save the others, or if (as what happens) they all fight back by his own distraction. The other scene is deeper, and perhaps the best serious scene in the film, when the group realizes just before they're about to blow up the guns that they have a traitor in their midst. It's impossible to give anything away, except to say that it has a quintessential use of a silencer in a movie.
