[{"Title":"When Gay-Friendly Film Making Goes Horribly Wrong","Date":"27 December 2005","Score":"65 out of 85 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" I read Tom Robbins' EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES as a teenager. I loved every word. It was sexy, funny, and full of glamorous scenery and beautiful writing. But when I saw the movie, I could not believe what a dull, sour, joyless piece of junk it was. How did this happen? I think someone in Hollywood read this book and filed it under GAY PRIDE -- WOMEN -- LESBIANS. (That's the Library of Congress subject heading.) Now anyone over 12 who reads the book will know it has NOTHING TO DO with real lesbians, any more than STAR WARS is about real space travel. The book was obviously -- and I do mean OBVIOUSLY --written by a heterosexual male who loves the IDEA of lesbians (in the nude, all the time)but has never really met one.Still, someone in Hollywood said, uh oh, better give this to a Gay director or Gay People will make trouble. So they handed it to Gus Van Sant. Nothing against the man, but -- however Gay he may really be -- he has not a clue as to how to make a funny film. Gus Van Sant took a straight man's playful fantasy of guilt-free girl/girl action and male voyeurism turned it into a dull, literal-minded Lesbian Power Recruiting Poster. It's like turning an Oscar Wilde comedy into an Arthur Miller tragedy. Not pretty.The main clue that Gus Van Sant had absolutely no idea what to do with the source material is the riotously bad casting. His clout allowed him to hire the very best. His ignorance of the novel's real subtext (a straight man's fantasy, not a gay pride recruiting poster)caused him to make choices that were not only bad, but bizarre.Let's meet the cast of EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES.PAT MORITA as THE CHINK Okay, there are few name-recognition Asian actors. And Pat Morita, in HAPPY DAYS, was fairly funny. But casting him as THE CHINK was wrong, wrong, wrong. Pat Morita has no idea that the Chink is a very funny man. (Gus didn't tell him.) Pat also doesn't seem to know that the Chink is . . . well, SEXY!!! In the book he's not wise old Mr. Miyagi. He's more like Hugh Hefner! He's a randy old goat and he knows A LOT about pleasing the nubile and responsive Sissy AND Bonanza Jellybean. (You see, in the book, they aren't REALLY lesbians. Do you get that this is a straight man's fantasy yet?) JOHN HURT as THE COUNTESS. Okay, he's a gay friendly man. But he is a SERIOUS, SHAKESPEAREAN ACTOR!!!! You need someone who is fun, and camp, for this role. For John Hurt to be cast as a goofy guy like the Countess is tragic and sad. I kept expecting Paul Scofield to wander in all dressed up as Thomas More, and sadly shake his head. Now, Richard, you know you've lost your soul entirely. For shame, my former student! And yes, John Hurt was funny (and pretty gay) as Caligula. But that was BLACK humor, not playful and breezy humor like the book.RAIN PHOENIX as Bonanza Jellybean. No talent, no training, no problem. Except that in the book Bonanza is funny, playful, cheerful, (mostly) heterosexual, and loving. In the movie she's sullen, passive, expressionless, and dull. As for her taste for women, Robbins in the book puts it like this. God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. Uh, Gus? Did you read this book? UMA THURMAN as Sissy Hankshaw. This is a tough role. In the book Sissy really is an unusually passive and timid heroine. Still, a more accomplished actress might have manufactured a twinkle in her eye, or a sway in her walk, to imply some sort of hidden strength or hidden enjoyment of her adventures. Uma doesn't pull it off, probably because Gus never told her Sissy is supposed to ENJOY being a hitch hiker with a beautiful body and giant thumbs. Uma plays it more like she's in a TV movie about a girl dying of leukemia. This movie is sour and dull. And I accuse YOU, Gus Van Sant! "},{"Title":"Sorry.

In fact, some of them are even more zanier than Robbins, and that's going some.  Look.  If you're going to read a book by Tom Robbins, you know it's going to be goofy.  Tom Robbins does goofy.  OK.  Now, if you're gonna see a movie about a Robbins book with Robbins input, what do you expect? Right.  Goofy.  So, what's the big deal? If you want Disney, go see some Bambi reruns. If you're gonna see Robbins, better read a few of his books first.  I personally like Robbins's books.  I howled my way through Jitterbug Perfume. And, being married to a Redhead, I loved Still Life with Woodpecker...OK.  Now, what's this film about?  Read the book.  If you want to see Uma, Rain and all the gang, rent the video but don't expect Disney.  You ain't gonna get it.  Obviously, most of the other reviewers didn't either.  Look.  A movie can't pull the same things off that a book can, and vice versa.  Robbins's books have a style that would seem very difficult to capture on film.  If anything, this film proves that.  Does it (i.e., the film) work?  Is it a viable form beyond the book? Does it fly on its own merit?  Can't say.  YOU watch it and decide.  I found many, many flaws in this film but also enjoyed much of it.  So, friends, check it out for yourselves...but, I'd strongly advise, reading some Robbins before you do.  It will save the shock later. "},{"Title":"4.0???

This movie is not entertainment, at least not that easy entertainment you get on movies like Titanic or Gladiator. It has style, it is different, it is shocking... That's why most of you have hated it so much because it does not try to be pleasing to you. It's just a story, a very weird one I admit, but after all, only a weird story. It is not a great story, not even a great cinema work, but I believe it is worth a 7-stars rating only for the courage of both author and director to shot a story that is not made to please the audience, thus selling billions of copies and making the big studios even richer. This movie is, for me, European-artistic-like movie made in the US, and everyone involved in the making of it deserves respect. Be it for the courage, or be it for the unique sense of humor.

I knew that there would be no way that the movie would capture even half of Robbins' magic, but after seeing the movie, it made me never want to read the book again. The movie Even Cowgirls Get the Blues doesn't include an eighth of the content in the book, and it seems to focus more on the love connection between Bonanza Jellybean and Sissy than anything else. Along with the incredibly weak plot line in the movie, I think that better actors definitely could have been chosen to play the characters. The only actors in the movie that I thought played their roles fit to Robbins' descriptions in the book were Julian's friends, in their five minute clip in the beginning of the movie. Those who haven't read the book might enjoy the movie, but as a huge Tom Robbins fan, this movie was nothing but a disappointment.

Maybe we'd missed something... nope, what's missing was missed from the beginning of preproduction. I actually went back to Robbin's novel to see if I could find the problem, and I discovered that what I thought was funny and exciting back in the day is now just so much disconnected and fuzzy-headed junk.So, the initial problem with the film was deciding to do it at all, and the rest of the train wreck progressed from there. Absolutely nothing works - not a blessed thing. Some beautiful exterior photography gets steamrolled by random camera placement in interior shots. All of the actors look at least uncomfortable - Angie Dickenson looks positively mortified - except for Rain Phoenix, who gives the impression that she is too unaware to realize how awful her performance really is. The dialog is one, long, unwavering cringe. Scenes don't make sense from second to second, and the connections between them are nonexistent. And yet, the movie stumbles blindly on, convinced that it is saying something profound.This is too bad to even be funny; it is simply excruciating. Gus Van Zant has done other good-to-great movies which I encourage you to see, and I'm happy he survived (and appears to have learned from) this mess.

Gus Van Sant directed and adapted Tom Robbins' book, but his satire has no primary target and just skitters all over the map, like Sissy (maybe that was his goal, but it's not involving for an audience). Notorious box-office flop wasn't so much panned as it was ignored, and one can see why it's a series of sketches in search of a plot, and the performances, directorial touches and cinematography are all variable. Thurman is a stitch posing alongside the highway trying to get a ride, but this pretty much put the kibosh on Phoenix's career. Writer Buck Henry (who didn't write this, but perhaps should have) gives the most assured performance as the doctor who works on one of those thumbs.Two thumbs down.

Uma Thurman is perfectly cast. She is just quirky enough to pull off the thumbs and obviously good looking enough to be a model. The rest of the cast is woefully miscast, mostly due to being too old for the parts, such as Lorraine Bracco and Pat Moriata. But the thing that really drags the movie down is that the spirit is missing. Even Cowgirls Get the Blues was written in the sixties, the time of free love, and man is the love free in the book. There is too much fear now to make a movie like that. Also, there were different ideals about psychiatry, philosophy, and freedom. It's a true product of it's time and could be filmed by someone with guts. Until then, I can always read the book again...

His directorial credits include My Own Private Idaho, To Die For, Drugstore Cowboy, and, most recently, the audacious and thought-provoking allegory of school violence, Elephant. He also was the executive producer of the infamous, eye-opening Kids. However, his reputation took a tumble with the needless, colorized shot-by-shot remake of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, with Vince Vaughn standing in for Anthony Perkins! However, Even Cowgirls Get The Blues goes down in history as one of the most witless, undramatic, incoherent, dumbest, laziest, and plot less films ever to be released upon the public. The counter-culture novel by Tom Robbins is 100% trashed here. The novel shouldn't have been filmed at such a late date anyway. Or, perhaps, it shouldn't have been filmed at all.Uma Thurman stars as Sissy Hankshaw, who somehow is a professional hitch-hiker (remember the book is set in the 60's; the movie makes no attempt to let us know exactly what time period this is supposed to be) who manages to get easy rides by sticking out her bulging, grossly large thumb. Yeah, that pulls the guys over every time.Sissy meets up with an insane slew of Hollywood stars who seem to be doing a special favor for Van Sandt. Meandering around are Roseanne Barr, John Hurt, Keanu Reeves, Crispin Glover, Carol Kane, and...are you ready...Angie Dickinson! For unknown reasons, Sissy hitches a ride to a feminist ranch that pampers spa services to rich women. For further unknown reasons, there's a gaggle of cowgirls living and working on the ranch, led by Rain Phoenix as Bonanza Jellybean. What results is nothing...nothing at all. There is not even the slightest story to speak of. The film seems to have been edited with duct tape. Van Sandt reportedly re-edited this film furiously after it was booed off of the screen at various premieres. I would love to see what he cut out. He would have been better off just completely scrapping this project.But Van Sant is all forgiven for this travesty. He has gone on to prove himself as a solid director/producer. Even Cowgirls Get The Blues is probably the only Gus Van Sant film that you can get for $2.00 out of a bargain bin at Family Dollar.

It wasn't that the characters weren't well developed or the plot and content didn't come alive. It's just that our imaginations are much more powerful when reading a book like this. We're taken away to a different time and place and we sometimes think the worst and/or the best and it adds to the overall roller-coaster of the book as it neatly unfolds according to the author's precision.

Well, you've got Uma Thurman, gyrating along the side of the road in an attempt to hitch a ride from any passing vehicle - she does an attention-grabbing motion that's somewhere between a cheerleader and a striptease dancer, but nevertheless quite erotic in its perfection.

Whip-snapping Lorraine Bracco feeding peyote buttons to migrating whooping cranes. Pat Morita earning a paycheck in the most delightful way. A K.d. lang soundtrack which is truly worth buying and listening to. Snippets of Richard Nixon addressing the nation on radio. Fragments of (almost) forgotten 60's hits (Ma Belle Amie by The Tee Set and A Taste of Honey by Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass, for example). Interesting (and beautiful) landscape shots of the Oregon wilderness, and odd freeze-frame segments that make you scratch your head. Tom Robbins doing periodic voiceovers - and he sounds just like Al Gore (and about as inspirational, too...) All this and a lot more, too. Angie Dickinson, for example.I don't know, it's a weird movie that ultimately gives feminists and lesbians a bad name (and we all know how painful that can be). But it has some images, and lines of dialogue that really make you do a double take (the ones from Ed Begley, Jr. come to mind). I was intrigued enough by the film, though, that I rewound my tape and watched the thing two more times just to get more of the quirky Tom Robbinsesque lines into my head. That doesn't necessarily mean it's a great movie, but it's by no means a bad movie either. It actually is kind of clever and charming in a few spots.

Her parents feared she'd never get married or amount to anything in life but one day her father makes a joke that she'd make a good hitchhiker. Sissy takes that advice and heads off in the world thumbing a ride to wherever she can get. As a teenager Sissy finds a modeling job in NYC for feminine hygiene advertisement, which claims she smells as good as she looks.After being the champ of feminine hygiene for five years running, Sissy finds herself back on the road traveling across the country. She eventually gets a phone call from the drag queen known as The Countess (John Hurt) who has managed to get her a new job up in Oregon.This job is working on a ranch, which has been taken over by a group of cowgirls who seem to be fighting exploitation. With Sissy there, the girls have a new fighter as well as possible lover.Even Cowgirls Get the Blues is based on a novel from Tom Robbins, which I haven't read.Perhaps had I read it I would have understood what this film was trying to say or trying to be about but as it is, I really have no idea. My only guess is that director Gun Van Sant was trying to recapture the exploitation films of the 1970's like Beyond the Valley of the Dolls but he fails miserably here and makes a film that's a bigger disgrace than his future remake of Psycho.The biggest joke running throughout the film is the stuff dealing with feminine hygiene and the fact that Sissy smells better than any other woman around. This stuff here is simply unfunny and I'm sure many would be offended by this humor. Since it's doesn't work and manages to be somewhat offensive I've got to wonder who this humor was meant to entertain. The other big joke is the huge thumbs, which lead to various dialogue scenes dealing with the joys of hitchhiking but once again, who in the world is suppose to find that entertaining? I've always enjoyed watching Uma Thurman because she's one of the most enlightening actresses out there. She can certainly handle comedy, which was proved in Mad Dog and Glory but it's clear she has no idea what to do with the material given to her. There's not a single moment in the film where I believed this was a real character and instead of any insight we are given two fake looking props to tell her story. What attracted her to this project is anyone's guess but what's even worse is the fact that the director got an all-star cast to appear in the film. Lorraine Bracco, Keanu Reeves, Crispin Glover, Angie Dickinson, Sean Young, Heather Graham and Roseanne are among the many familiar faces and none of them bring anything to their roles. My only guess is that these folks forgot to read the script and just thought the idea of being in a cameo would be cool.I remember watching this film opening day in Louisville, KY where the theater was fairly packed Before the movie opened you could tell there was a loud buzz about the film due to the director's previous films, which included Drugstore Cowboy. As soon as the film started you could feel that entire buzz leave the theater and for the next two hours there was a complete silence that was rather haunting. No one was fascinated by what they were seeing but instead every single person was in a state of shock. Was this film some kind of job? Did Van Sant make a bad film on purpose? That's my only guess because there's nothing going good for this turkey, which would give anyone the blues.

Third  delores wheres the badass from the beginning? right away you let out  the coke-fiendish interp. of this gal, and thats not how robbins set it up.  get that badass up front; we are not supposed to know you right off the bat.  you need to gradually reveal yourself, not  right from the start. delores is full of mystery and black clouds; her whip is like a tantalizing c'mere-and-figgure-me-out cat's (or snake's) tail or something.  yes, you do convey parts of delores' personality we learn of later in the book, but slow down girl. Fourth  the rest of you guys.  i guess the chink was okay, but not as vulgar as he should be.  i know intruducing vulgarity into the movie would *really* screw with the minds of the masses coming to see uma, and eh, itd probably scare em a bit.  but um. wouldnt that be kindof fun? )   anyways, one constant theme through mr robbins' books is that sex is HUMAN, and GOOD, and ohhhh. yum. (this is more to the director...) you give us a few scenes, but you cut things out (julian? husband? hello?) or shorten them (scene with the couple in julians apt) or hide them (the chink looking on the girls making out from afar rather than from their own eyes).  i know you dont want it to cross into the realm of pornography, but well.  sheesh. to the director  dangit man.  try again. and not a movie, maybe a television series or something.  maybe just a series, screw the tv crap.  but to make this movie successful, you really do need almost all of the substance of the book to shine forth.  you cant take things out ad-hock... im sure it wasnt all that random, but the deletions you made did seem inappropriate; the lack of important information created a throughly disjointed feel.  if you wanted to make a movie out of a robbins book, you probably really liked the book, and probably had a really good idea of what each character seemed to be.  well, fer cripes sake, stick to yer guns.  find people who you know fit the roles; encourage them to READ THE BOOK... infact, make it mandatory... maybe read it with the cast like it was an english class, so you get class discussions and debates going back and forth.  it should be a learning experience and rocking fun time for the actors, the crew, and the director... and it *should* be somethin similar for the viewers too. thats my two cents.

I'll say to you don't even bother watching because it's a completely waste of time (for those who are about to rent it a waste of money, I feel sorry for those Gus Van Sant's die hard fans that payed for this nonsense to see this in theaters back in 1994). I mean, not absolutely total waste of time. The first 40 minutes are great, they left a curiosity in see what's going to happen next and then it's all downhill.Uma Thurman plays Sissy, a woman who was born with enormous thumbs that help her hitchhiking through the US. So far so good. When she goes to New York she becomes a model and eventually she starts working with 'the Countess' (John Hurt) an agent who sends her to a ranch in CA to shoot a commercial. In this beauty ranch she becomes friends of a bunch of cowgirls (all of them lesbians) and the movie turn out to be a unfunny piece of wasted moments where actors come and go without no explanation and we're sorry for them.

Naturally, she likes to hitchhike. She doesn't consider herself a freak; people were made the way they were for a reason (the dancer Nijinsky, for example, has unusual feet).  Her parents did not feel the same way; when she was a child in the 50s, they took her to a wacky fortune teller (good performance by Roseanne, but too brief) to find out if she had a future.  But as an adult in the 70s, Sissy is comfortable living on the road with no permanent address.  One day she goes to visit a friend in New York City named The Countess, another goofy character of uncertain gender.  She gets restless in the city, but The Countess wants her to go to a 'beauty ranch' out west which The Countess owns.  There are cattle there, but the primary purpose of the place is to make women more beautiful.  Sissy was a star in TV commercials in the 60s, and her job will be to make more commercials.  The cowgirls who run the ranch don't like being told what to do, and they eventually take over the place violently. Sissy is befriended by the tough but attractive Bonanza Jellybean, who apparently wants to be more than friends.  Sissy leaves when things get violent and meets an old mountain man nicely played by Pat Morita (another quirky character, and one who doesn't spend enough time onscreen, though he returns later in the movie).  She returns to the ranch later when a dispute over endangered birds makes national headlines.There were some good acting performances, mostly by the comic characters. The woman playing Bonanza Jellybean did a good job, and Uma Thurman was pretty good as Sissy. Most of the music was quite good, with some vocals by k.d. lang.  Many of her songs made me wonder why they can still call it country radio.I thought this might be a comedy when I saw the various strange characters. Unfortunately, too much time is spent on showing how tough and independent the women are, and even though that's not always a negative for me, it was in this case.  If you are uncomfortable with references to lesbian behavior, you may not want to watch.  And something almost happened (of a sexual nature) in New York City that I'd just as soon not describe.

She travels for years, being a model as well, before she is drawn back to the city with a job offer.  She travels to the ranch of The Countess and gets involved in a lesbian love affair, a siege involving wildlife and all manner of soul searching.Reading a critic deriding Kill Bill by saying that it's lack of humour left `Even Cowgirls etc' as Thurman's funniest film, I decided to watch it to see what he meant.  I can only assume he meant funny as in `so bad it's good' type laughs, as I was simply left annoyed and bewildered by the whole film. The plot is a road movie style affair but it lacks any sort of cohesion at all.  Scenes and plot devices have almost no wider meaning and it all feels like a collection of unusual ideas which have been fired at a script in the hope it all works out.The opening scenes are funny enough to start my interest but after that it all just falls apart as one pointless scene follows another.  The lack of any real characters was a major problem for me as I had not even one character who could help me get into this mess of a film.  Most of the characters have no depth to them - even Sissy herself is a poorly constructed character who's motivations and feelings are so badly explained that they might as well have been just presented and then forgotten (oh, hang on, they were!).  When a group of women drops their trousers and march on a crowd, frightening them with their `unhygienic vaginas' you know that things are not as they should be!The actors cannot save this mess.  Thurman looks lost and as unsure of her character as I was.  Instead she tries to wring humour out of the film by embracing any moment which may have had some value in it's unusual actions. Bracco is a mess - no character, poor lines and dropping her trousers for a film of no merit.  Hurt is an embarrassment and I really wondered what on earth had made him sign up for this. Cameos from Keanu Reeves, Roseanne Barr, Sean Young, Rain Phoenix and Begley Jnr slightly add interest but really just provide yet more poorly constructed characters to not care about.Overall this is not the worst film in the world and some may like it for it's freewheeling nature, lack of linear plot and attempts at humour by creating one `unusual/weird' situation after another.  Me, I hated it for all these reasons.  I found it rambling, without point, without comic or dramatic value and, put plainly, a real shambles of a movie that was an effort to get through.

Having read & loved this book, I knew she was not a good choice, and she was subsequently was named Worst Actress of 1993 for her terrible attempt to portray Cissy. Likewise, Rain aka Rainbow aka Rain Phoenix was also miscast, as well as not being talented enough to pull off what could have been a great role, that of Boss Cowgirl Bonanza Jellybean. Rain Phoenix didn't look as if she was reading off a TelePrompter, she looked like she was A)Wondering what a TelePrompter was & B)Wondering what to to with a TelePrompter once she figured out what it was. I've seen better acting in 1950's Mexican porn. Did I detect her lips moving before she attempted to deliver her lines? The reason she was not named Worst Actress of 1993 was that to win that award, she had to be an actress, which she clearly is not. Sean Young looked so sexy I almost forgot about her psychotic meltdown over James Woods, but she showed less acting ability than in her role in Blade Runner. Angie Dickinson, that 60's-70's retread hearthrob of teenage males was nearly as bad as Phoenix & Thurman, but she had an excuse, she hadn't worked for many years, & seemed critically hungover.

And the romance between Sissy and Jellybean seems very sweet.  Though the plot is very weak, I think the satirical humor more than makes up for it. Then there's the kick-ass soundtrack which features the tremendously talented K.D. Lang (who reminds me a little of Patsy Cline) at her best.   I can't think of any movie that has grown on me after an inauspicious first impression, as much as  Cowgirls has.

What was the director trying to do? The acting was worse than some elementary school productions. I'm sorry, Rain Phoenix turned in an embarrassing performance. I had hoped for more from Uma Thurman who looked like she couldn't wait to get off the sets. Thank goodness I only had to pay 99 cents to see this video! "}]
