It takes about 30 minutes before it really gets going, when Bill Murray and Vera hit the road.  Bill Murray's performance is serviceable if unspectacular; it's a rather underwritten role that could have been played by most anyone, but the low-wattage version of Murray's charm does come through from time to time.  Janeane Garofalo is well-used in a small role, but Matthew McConnaughey makes the most vivid impression in truly goofy part as an insane truck driver.  Except for exposition, the first quarter or so of the film is dull, but the rest makes for pleasant if low-key entertainment.  The relationship between man and elephant is genuinely touching.

One thing has kept him a star however and that's himself &#150; even an average film can be made enjoyable by him, and that's what happens here.  The plot is predictable &#150; who will he give the elephant to, the evil trainer or the jungle bunny? Will he make it in time? The answers are easy, but no matter.  The message about loving animals etc are a little sentimental and don't sit well with the idea that we are actually watching an animal that belongs to a movie organisation such as the one being shown here as evil!The comedy is also predictable &#150; we know the elephant will knock things down and lift things up etc, but it's not overdone and is amusing to a point. It may not be rocket science but it will please kids for sure.  For adults the physical nature of this comedy is tempered by a world weary Murray who really does make the film worth watching.  He is a funny guy and although he is on auto-pilot here, he is still very good.The film rests solely on his shoulders and he just about carries it off.  The rest of the cast may well be made of faces but they are all in minor roles.  People like Piven, Garofalo, Fiorentino, Jerry Alder, Presnell etc are all round the edges making it look tidy but really do little.  McConaughey has a bigger, minor role but he isn't very good.  His character is funny but he doesn't quite carry it off and I wonder if he is embarrassed by it now.Overall this sort of thing usually stinks the place up, and this one doesn't.  It's nothing special but is amusing enough to pass the time.

You see, his father drowned when Jack was a boy and his mother (Anita Gillette) raised him as a single parent. Now, however, Jack is an aspiring Anthony Robbins with a beautiful fianc√©e. Hold the phone! A lawyer contacts Jack by letter to tell him his father recently passed away and left him an inheritance. WHat ? ? Mom admits she lied to Jack because his father, Kirby, was too irresponsible to hold down a job, so she left him and invented the tragic tale of his demise. But, hey, maybe money can heal so Jack travels to the east coast to visit the lawyer. After some tricky moves by this attorney, Jack signs a contract. But, Holy Dumbo Batman, Jack has just inherited a circus elephant named Vera. It seems papa's last job was with the circus and his great act included a trained elephant. What the heck is Jack going to do with a pachyderm? Yet, he must take possession of Vera immediately. After spending the night in a junkyard with Vera, Jack finds out that a zookeeper in Los Angeles would like Vera very much, as she is returning some elephants to their natural habitat. Thus, the cross country trip of trips begins. From raiding a whole salad bar for the elephant's meals to riding in cattle car, Jack and Vera try to make it to the west coast in time. Will they? This darling film is an instant classic. Murray has rarely been better than this ordinary Joe thrust into extraordinary circumstances. Piven, Gillette, Janeane Garafolo, and all the other cast members are fine, too. As for the elephant Vera, what a charmer with loads of talent.

Well, actually, it /is/ a stupid, idiotic film. But it works, mostly because of Bill Murray's performance.A man who has to unload his father's trained elephant does not make for a promising story, comic or dramatic. What makes this film work is Murray's generally laid-back performance. His character -- a motivational instructor who teaches patient and thoughtful behavior -- displays such. He rarely gets badly upset, and there's little of the frantic slapstick one would expect from other actors. (I suspect Roy Blount was consciously writing such a story.) When a reviewer states that the film misses the obvious sight gags its premise suggests -- well, that's the point of it, right?This isn't a film that demands a second viewing. But it's far better than you might expect, and its refusal to assault the viewer is welcome.

Murray plays a motivational speaker who finds himself saddled with Velma, a female elephant that belonged to his recently deceased circus clown father whom he never met. When mom and pop went their separate ways, mom got Murray and pop kept the pachyderm. Now, pop's attorney (Harve Presnell of Fargo) wants $35-thousand to cover the damages that Tarzan's best friend has chomped up while he waited on our hero to claim his inheritance.The only way that Jack Corcoran (Bill Murray of Ghostbusters) can get off the tusk is to take the animal across country to a zoo, specifically to Mo (Janeane Garofalo) who is willing to buy Velma as part of a breeding experiment in India. This is Jack's first option. The second option, he learns, is a sexy animal trainer who is prepared to up the ante for Velma. The dilemma that Jack faces is who to sell the beast to, either the sympathetic but homely zoo keeper (Garofalo had a similar role in The Truth about Cats and Dogs) or temptress animal trainer Terry Bonura (Linda Fiorentino), who uses electric prods to make her beasties behave.Getting the elephant there comprises the bulk of Roy Blount, Jr's lackluster, lead-footed plot. You could grow as old and wrinkled as an elephant waiting for an original laugh here. Jack and Velma travel by train, truck, and on foot, but they encounter trouble around every bend. Along the way, Jack tricks a paranoid, speed-freak truckers, Tip Tucker (Matthew McConaughey of Dazed and Confused) into giving them a lift. When Tip learns that Jack has duped him, he raises a posse of state troopers who follow in hot pursuit, Jack blunders off the interstate and heads into the desert. Velma and he save an antique Spanish church from a flood. The grateful villagers idolize the elephant and helps Jack finish his cross-country jaunt. Film purists will have reason to complain. At one point, Jck dons the outfits that John Wayne wore in John Ford's 1949 classic She Wore a Yellow Ribbon to elude Tucker. The filmmakers back up this costume change as Jack sticks to the back trails with Elmer Bernstein's classic Magnificent Seven theme. Talk about mixing movie metaphors! If you cannot figure out the ending, perhaps you should treat yourself to this shoddy farce that stretches its unlikely partners premises far beyond the breaking point.

And I was right. This was not a case of a good movie being horribly marketed - this was a case of the badness of the movie being shown all too clearly.What went wrong? Well, I think that the main problem of the movie centers around the fact that pretty much all the events of the movie center around an elephant. Elephants are slow creatures, and although they can be trained to perform some tricks, they are still far from being creatures with a real charismatic personality. (Maybe if they got a quicker, wittier creature like a chimpanzee or a dog, it could have worked.) As a result of this movie being weighed down by an enormously ungraceful creature, there is no energy here. Even Murray, who has been quick and funny in other movies, seems overwhelmed. He does well in the opening scene where he's a motivational speaker, because he has *humans* to work with. When he's paired with the elephant, the energy immediately fades away.One question that's never answered in the movie is Why doesn't Murray's character just hire someone to take the elephant to the west coast? It would be a lot less hassle, and Murray's character wouldn't have to skip his lecture dates. The fact that Murray's character doesn't do the obvious thing helps point out that the premise this script had was deeply flawed even before writing began.

I feel pity because of an easy script like this. So what was the meaning that the lead is a motivational speaker ?! and what exactly had changed in him after this trip ? and is there any intended similarity between him as a speaker and his father as a clown ?

OK, Matthew McConaughey cleverly plays a crazy driver (in the same year of his breakthrough A Time to Kill). Although that was humorous lateral conflict, but the script made him take part after the end of its first half !?? And event like the lead's fianc√©e leaving him to marry his publisher (as the finale's board shows) pushes you to ask Why she left him ??! I think the Trip just affected the lead in a way to learn more lessons about life or to know what he really wants, and to discover more credibility around him.

About the same size as elephant manure, though.","Date":"28 December 2007","Score":"0 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family","Review":" LTL is the kind of formulaic, hopeless comedy to be enjoyed by the sort of sheep that stop and listen when they come across a band playing in a shopping mall.I remember Murray promoting LTL on Larry King's crappy CNN show, where he said something like if this movie doesn't become a hit I'll stop making movies (or comedies). He wasn't being nearly as jovial as one might think; he must have felt that LTL was a sure-fire hit and that its failure would mean his status as a star had markedly fallen - hence a sort-of ultimatum live-on-air to his fans to spend their hard-earned money on a dumb elephant comedy. (The comedy being dumb, not the elephant...) Or maybe he simply realized during the shooting (or when he saw the final cut) what a turkey this was, so he tried desperately to convince everyone how much optimism he had regarding LTL's quality. Go see it, it really is good! Actors are prostitutes inter-bred with car salesmen.LTL is the sort of lousy project that comes from the Friends school of comedy; their motto If you ever run out of ideas - or if you never had any in the first place - then stick an animal into the plot and that will at least inject an element of cuteness. Cuteness = a sad substitute for lack of funny gags. The other motto Friends had was always include pointless, dull sentimentality, which this movie so predictably ends with, when Murray rather pathetically says what they forgot to tell you is that you never forget an elephant. Maybe not an elephant, but I certainly managed to easily forget this turkey, which I saw many years ago. I was suddenly reminded of it when I saw a scene from it on TV today (hence this equally pointless review).Murray wastes his talent on this turkey (disguised as an elephant), but he isn't nearly as uninteresting/bad as McConaughey (or however that man's name is spelt); one would think that M.M. would have an easy time playing himself, i.e. a hick, but he is so painfully unfunny and unconvincing that I could barely stand to watch him make such a jackass out of himself. It was cringe-worthy. To round off this nonsense, we have that generation-X buffoon, Garofalo, in a rather useless role. Then again, everything about LTL is useless...After LTL, which bombed as far as I know, Murray went on to become more of a serious actor. What is it with these comedians and their inferiority complex? Is it all just about getting awards, i.e. recognition from their peers (read votes from their moron colleagues)? This piece of crap marked the end of a string of good and great movies Murray made in the early- and mid-90s, such as Groundhog Day, Quick Change, Mad Dog & Glory, Kingpin, What about Bob? and Ed Wood. Recently we've had the immeasurable pleasure of seeing him in garbage/mediocrities such as Hamlet, Lost In Translation (you just can't get away from these ultra-talented Coppolas), and Broken Flowers. Compare those two batches.One guy described LTL funny as heck. Now THAT'S the kind of audience this movie was hoping for... Shopping malls and trailer parks... "}]
