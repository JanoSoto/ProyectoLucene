She has the uncanny ability to talk about very sensitive issues (racism, self image, family, cruelty in the entertainment industry, and of course sex in all of its forms), and make them accessible through sheer hilarity.  Her timing is impeccable, her imitations uproarious, and her candor admirable.  This movie is an autobiographical account of her life including the failure of her sit-com.  Through it all, she is able to show her audience a great deal of vulnerability, and still come out triumphant.  I laughed so hard I thought I had gone through a 90 minute abdominal workout.

What's the point of paying to see a MOVIE when really you're just seeing a stand-up routine or concert like something you'd see on HBO--since the live, in person aspect is missing, what's the point? Aren't movies all about seeing something you couldn't see in a play or on a TV show? I still haven't resolved this cinematic question for myself, but I can tell you that this movie is more entertaining than 99% of what Hollywood studios produce. I defy anyone to see this movie and not have a great, gut-busting time (prudes excepted, perhaps). So much of what's been written about this film says that it's essentially just about her experience with her failed sitcom, but, in fact, that's just one of several set pieces of the film. The best bits have to do with Cho's mother (her imitation is both hilarious and a bit touching), and Cho spends a lot of time on gay-related bits (many of which are genuinely funny). But what I discovered about Cho through this movie was that one of her greatest strengths--what sets her apart from her peers--are her facial expressions, which are versatile and always dead-on. Many times, the punchline is not a snappy line, but rather, Cho's dead-on facial expression. Finally, I knew why, at least in this case, a concert film format was appropriate unless you had front row seats to the show, there's no way most audience members at the live show could enjoy Cho 100%, but the movie camera allows us to see her every facial movement (before erupting in laughter). Unlike an HBO comedy special, this film does have a serious emotional throughline--that being Cho's quest to accept herself and be happy. The comedy gets raunchy but is always funny; the entertainment value of this film--made on the most simple terms--far surpasses that of most movies made today. Highly recommended. (p.s. when I saw the film in Los Angeles, Cho was on hand at the theater to take tickets herself; she is deservedly very proud of this movie).

Cho's unclassifiable id--Asian-American omnisexual is a poor sticker for the self she unloads here--can find no name, no resting place, and no club that will have it as a member. Never has alienation been so explosively hilarious. And beyond the content of her work, Cho is a master of her craft, a genius manipulator of silence, long-held muggy faces, microphone-stand grasps, lunges for the water bottle, and sheer stillness. Her precision can be scary. There is a little too much face-pulling and playing to the balcony of Boys' Town (Cho's I am a faghag! shtik seems designed to churn up microwaved warmth from her fan base). But there are many moments--especially Cho's rendering of her inexplicably insane-seeming mom--that could stand toe to toe with Lenny Bruce and Pryor at their tops.

I really wanted to see it after hearing about it at her website. This was much different from her previous routines as this was a one woman show rather than stand up comedy. This first few minutes are pretty slow where she talks about sexuality.When she gets into the meat of the show (The All American Girl incident), that is where she excels. We hear the story behind the failure of the show, Margaret selling out to the show's plot (An episode has her making fun of her parents at a club, something she does often in her routine. In the end, she publicly apologizes for making fun of her parents), losing weight rapidly because the network told her too, and a whole lot more. When she gets serious, we feel her pain. When it was cancelled, she goes into a downward spiral. I loved her retort when she replaced by Drew Carey (Because he was so thin lol).I love the empowerment Margaret gives herself when she realizes that losing a show was not the living end. She knows better now because of those unattainable goals that Hollywood sets up for women and ethnic comedians. She shows her strength and defiance against the system. In the end, she comes out a winner.  "},{"Title":"What can I say?

But then she gets the motor going again at the end.The fact is Margaret Cho is the funniest woman alive. I identify with her life so much it scares me. The mother-answering-machine jokes are pee-in-your-pants funny, although a little too long in the tooth. The main reason I gave this film a 10 out of 10 is mainly for the brutal honesty Margaret gives the audience. She can't be making this stuff up!Some of the highlights of the show are Lesbians love whale watching!,  Am I Gay? Am I Straight? No, I'm just easy. Where's my parade? and the always laughable, A**Masters skit. Always a crowd favorite.After I rented this movie, I went right to the web and bought this disc.

Regaling against the Hollywood machinery which nearly put her away for good, Cho masterfully segues from stories about her failed TV-sitcom All American Girl to side stories and family memories which gives her main theme--being true to yourself--more depth and punch. Smartly opening with rebel grrl music, Cho appears on-stage without any gimmicks (her follow-up concert, Notorious C.H.O., added a back-screen which was probably helpful to that audience but a distraction for movie viewers). This concert keeps getting better, with the funniest of the jokes becoming staples in Cho's repertoire. *** from **** "},{"Title":"maybe you need to like fags to get it","Date":"9 December 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Documentary, Comedy","Review":" This movie rules on so many levels. Take the comments of james_cocos-snowboots with a grain of salt; his favorite movies include Police Academy 3 & The Adventures of Ford Fairlane. Oh, and 'Boots, she's not a dyke. That part is a gag. (Can't blame you for not paying attention, since you didn't like the movie, but really, you put your foot in it with that one.)Further evidence that 'Boots is not in Cho's intended demographic his comment on another film reads as follows ...this movie really hits home as a commentary on modern morality in a world that has lost its teleological end as an ethical culture in which the end of life is ethical satisfaction and contentment with God and His ultimate purpose. ('Boots, I think you should make sure you look up them big fancy words before you use 'em -- if the world can actually lose its teleological end, that means that your God isn't omnipotent. Which I'd agree with, but I doubt you would.)By the way, I'm a straight white man. So you don't have to be a queen, dyke, Korean- American, or fag hag to love Margaret Cho.

She seems to ham-it-up a lot more in this performance.  Also, whereas in past stand-up performances, the laughs would come rapid-fire, one after another (I guess because of time-restraints), Margaret seems to be stretching out her jokes a little too long, either through repeating the same thing over and over (e.g.the vagina-washer bit, fag-hag) or by making silly faces and ogling at the camera.This is not to say that this movie isn't funny, there are some bits that are absolutely hilarious.  Her best material is the stuff regarding Asians, such as the prejudice and stereotyping (e.g. The Margaret Cho Rice Diet, the Asian Thing) and her impressions of her decidedly ethnic Korean mother.  While I used to like her material about gays, it seems like she hams it up a little too much here, and is specifically playing it up for her large gay audience.  It feels more forced in this performance.  That being said, Ass master still made me laugh till I cried.All in all, a good performance with some rather sad and touching(but not necessarily funny) material about her ordeal with her failed sitcom.  She is becoming little too much drama-queen or diva though and it takes a toll on her humor.  I liked her raunchy, rebellious, F the system, Asian-chick persona much better.

It deals with her getting her sitcom (the horrible All American Girl) and the hell it put her through and how she survived after it was cancelled. The movie is uproarious (most of the jokes are aimed at gay men...but I think anyone should get them), but there are moments when she details how cruelly ABC treated her and how she felt. Those moments are heart-breaking to watch...but she doesn't dwell on them. She tells you them loudly and with a matter of fact manner that's utterly great. And she zips through them to get on to the next joke. So it's a comedy performance but also how an Asian American woman survived despite all odds against her. Her final comments are uplifting.Also there are hysterical recreations of her mother (who seems to be living in a different universe). Her mother was there the night of that performance--I'd LOVE to know what she thought!A must for gay men and lesbians (I saw it with both audiences--us guys loved it, the lesbians did too but not as much).

The layers of outrageous humor and friendly exasperation at first conceal, and eventually reveal, intense two-way love and loyalty. Cho's vignette about her mother's favorite Mother's Day is incredible. Cho's mom routines are fully realized portraits - of a relationship, an immigrant experience, and the best stuff of families.

It's also an occasionally uncomfortable viewing experience.  She clearly has a major talent for stand-up comedy which allows her to ultimately triumph over some bad material.  The one woman show which has been filmed primarily relates the story of her experience having a primetime network television series built around her stand-up act.  Cho, who was in her early twenties at the time, was the first Asian performer to star in a network television series.  She wasn't prepared for TV executives pressuring her to lose weight or their complaining that her show wasn't Asian enough or later that it was too Asian.  She had to endure rude comments about her weight and racial slurs. The show was soon cancelled.   Aside from brilliantly amusing people with her comedic skills, observations, and impressions of Asian stereotypes including her representation of her mother, she has a serious message about the racism and the images of female beauty that prevail in Hollywood and the rest of the country.  It will be hard for most people to have the sympathy Cho feels she deserves for the indignities she's suffered because of the way she looks.  It's hard to accept that someone as observant and smart as Cho was blind to the obstacles she would face pursuing a television and film career.  That said,  I did laugh out loud during this movie more than I have at any other in recent memory.

For 90 minutes Cho takes the audience on a journey through the trials and tribulations that she ensued both before and after the failure of her short lived sit-com.  The ride, though rocky in parts, is worth the price of admission.  Told with brutal honesty and biting humour the audience is told of Cho's first sexual experience, hilarious tales recounted about her mother and growing up in San Francisco's gay meca.  The rise and fall of her TV stardom is what makes up the bulk of the show and while fitted well with humour it made this die hard fan sad to know that someone who seems so wonderful had to experience such cruelty and shallowness in this world.  Fortunately for the audience we are shown that one can rise above it all and ultimately discover the real person we each truly are.  Cho is in top form holding both her live audience and theater audience captive throughout never disappointing for one moment.

(Dir Lionel Coleman) Margaret Cho is another example of The American Dream gone askew. Cho, whose abrasively funny stand-up act is captured on film in concert in San Francisco, has a certain acquired taste not unlike Roseanne or even dare I say Richard Pryor in the sense that she has a lot on her mind and many may not want to hear it.At least not when she's shrieking like a banshee.Cho, as many know of her celebrity, became something of an overnight success with her short-lived ABC tv sitcom, 'All-American Girl', which was to stream line her Korean American heritage with her bone-cutting humor and humiliating takes on her own, somewhat more subservient family. Here in concert she tells with some heartbreaking moments of just what personal hell she had to submit to in her desire to be someone.Executives of the network told her she had a too round face (subtle racism brewing), she was too fat, not Asian enough, too Asian (or as she so sardonically recalls her former manager saying 'they're not buying the Asian thing') and finally yanking the program from their line-up to ironically replace it with 'The Drew Carey Show' with its own rotund star (!) Cho barely survived her attempt to trim the fat (she lost a life-threatening 30 pounds in 2 weeks prior to the premiere of the show that shut down her kidneys and a hilarious meeting with a hosptial's scrub nurse) and subsequent purging by drinking and imbibing as well as being 'slutty' as she remits before an adoring audience.Other topics discussed are her relationships with gay men ('I was raised by drag queens'), the difference in types of porn, sleeping around, strippers and her ever meaningful mother's funny answering machine advice messages ('Don't marry a white man!') However unlike the aforementioned Cho she doesn't use her blue material to her advantage and often comes across as a bitter, coarse woman but then again maybe that is her appeal. She deserves some recognition after all she went through and this performance solidifies her contendership. Take her opening and closing Joan Jett songs, 'Cherry Bomb' and 'Bad Reputation' and it pretty much sums up The Tao of Cho.

I don't understand why some shtick is delivered for a minute and a half (magician's handkerchief).
