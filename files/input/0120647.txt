It boasted a fine cast that did great work the standout being Morgan Freeman and Robert Duvall. The rest of the cast though also did quite well. The story was handled in a fairly realistic manner and didn't require me to roll my eyes at the many plot contrivances the way the others I listed did. The only major flaw for me was the casting of tea Leoni. The usually dependable actress was extremely bland in this film. She has done much better work in her career. Despite that flaw this is another fine movie that for some reason is really under rated.

Deep Impact is a drama; Armageddon is an action film, and delivers just what we would expect from an action film, namely, over-the-top characters, a simplistic storyline, and an abundance of special effects. Deep Impact presents just the opposite Characters that are notably human, several dovetailed story lines, and it saves the special effects (which are very good) for the movie's climax.Armageddon did better at the box office primarily because it was much more hyped, and because it featured an A-list star (Bruce Willis) while Deep Impact did not. Its enjoyability, though, is very limited If you are not a fan of the action genre, you will not like Armageddon. Deep Impact is the substantially better film and reaches out to the viewer to a far deeper degree.As you certainly know, the plot revolves around the fact that a seven-mile-wide comet is on a collision course with earth, and if it makes impact it will represent an Extinction Level Event (i.e., the death of all life on the planet). Having about a year and a half's notice of this, the U.S. and Russian governments send a spacecraft, the Messiah, to destroy the comet by drilling nuclear warheads into its core and then detonating. The movie focuses on three primary story lines 1. The young reporter Jenny Lerner (Tea Leoni) and her struggles with her career and her parents; 2. The high-school couple of Leo Biederman (who discovered the comet; Elijah Wood) and Sarah (Leelee Sobieski); 3. The crew of the Messiah.All three story lines are done in such a way that the viewer easily sympathizes with the very believable characters. The best done of the three is the spaceship's crew, although the most time is spent with Jenny. They all suffer from the film's only notable problem The story lines seem somewhat rushed. Considering its broad scope, Deep Impact clearly would benefit from an extra 30 minutes to develop, especially with the underdone angle with Leo and Sarah, but the directors evidently decided two hours was all they could use.Deep Impact, as I mentioned, lacks an A-list star, but it does feature superb performances from two of the best supporting actors of our generation Robert Duvall (Spurgeon Tanner, captain of the spaceship) and Morgan Freeman (Tom Beck, the U.S. President). Duvall is definitely the standout of the film with an A+ performance as Tanner.As for the other actors/actresses Tea Leoni (playing Jenny Lerner) gets the most face time in the film and delivers a believably good performance. Maximillian Schell as Jenny's father is the one notable casting mistake; I'm not sure what they were going for with him, but they could have done better. Venessa Redgrave does well as Jenny's divorcée mother.Elijah Wood (now a star but at the time just an up-and-comer) works very well as the teenage Leo Biederman, and Leelee Sobieski as his girlfriend Sarah gives us as good a performance as we can expect, considering how woefully underdeveloped her character is. The film arguably devotes a bit too much time to Jenny and her father and not enough to Leo and Sarah.If you haven't seen this movie yet, it should be at the top of your must-see list. The film moves at a good pace (if a bit fast), grabs your attention at the beginning and holds it throughout, and it features a truly exceptional final 20-25 minutes. What stands out most about this movie is its human touch and sensitivity. It manages to probe an impressive array of human emotions in two hours' time, and it will leave you with plenty to think about -- although it probably will not leave you with dry eyes. There are precisely three movies I have seen that caused the room to get dusty around me (if you get my drift), and this is one of them.In conclusion See this movie.

I've seen this film several times and EVERY TIME it gets me a little misty-eyed at certain points in the film.  Since the release of this film and Armageddon, I've been unsure which of the two I liked better.  I have always been leaning towards Deep Impact, so today I watched the film again to be sure.  I definitely believe that Deep Impact is a better film.  Although, Armageddon is a fantastic movie in it's own right.  I like Deep Impact better because I feel the story is much more realistic and slightly more interesting.  Also, the acting in this film is just fantastic (but again, Armageddon was well-acted as well).  After viewing the film again today, I thought ya know, there is virtually nothing in the film that I really disliked, whereas there are a number of things in Armageddon that I really disliked!  The cast in this film is absolutely superb!  You've got Robert Duvall, Tea Leoni, Elijah Wood, Vanessa Redgrave, Morgan Freeman, Maximilian Schell, James Cromwell, Ron Eldard, Jon Faverau, Laura Innes, Mary McCormack, Richard Schiff, Leelee Sobieski, Blair Underwood, Dougray Scott and Kurtwood Smith.  They all did a superb job in this film and I think they all deserve a great deal of credit.  I really liked that all the characters in the film were likeable.  There wasn't a single one that rubbed me the wrong way, they were all very well done characters.  I have to mention the special effects as well.  They are just mind-blowing!  All of the scenes with the astronauts on the comet are just superb!  ...And the ship that they fly looks so cool!  Also, the scene where the smaller comet hits the earth is just great!  The level of detail is unbelievable in some of the scenes.  You should see this film for the special effects alone.  If you like science fiction films with a great story that is quite touching at times, then by all means go see it.  This film is honestly one of the better movies I've seen in quite some time.  I truly hope that you enjoy the film.

Both 'Deep Impact' and 'Armageddon' were released in that year but while I did enjoy the thrill and special effects of the latter film, I find 'Deep Impact' the superior of the two.The film begins when a teenage amateur astronomer discover a comet on a direct collision course for the Earth. The world is then thrown into turmoil has humanity has to accept their possible extinction. While NASA sends a shuttle up with the intention to try to blow the comet to bits, the US government selects people to be saved in a cave they are building to withstand the event. Focusing on various unrelated characters, the film shows how people react differently to the destruction of all that they know.The brilliant cast, including Morgan Freeman, Vanessa Redgrave, Robert Devall, Elijah Wood, Ron Eldard and many others, all given great depictions of their characters. It is because of their ability to bring their respective characters to life that 'Deep Impact' stands up so well as it is a very emotional and character driven story, as opposed to 'Armageddon', which relied much more on humour and special effects to sell it. Téa Leoni is the only one who doesn't shine through like her co-stars as her performance is quite bland and doesn't capture her character's turbulent emotions. However, as the rest of the cast give great performances, it's easy to overlook her. And even though there is much attention given to establishing the characters doesn't mean the film skimps when it comes to the special effects. Both the scenes in space and those on Earth when the comet hits the planet are well-handled visually. It features some of the best special effects of planetary annihilation that I've ever seen (and I'm a big fan of these disaster flicks).What makes 'Deep Impact' rather unique in terms of disaster films is that it gives a very human side to tragedy and devastation by showing how ordinary people cope in times of crisis but it avoids the trap of being trite and overly-sentimental. It's a shame the film is so underrated then as it is a film that would appeal to sci-fi fans and those seeking an interesting story with strong characters.

Most disaster films fit into this category their plot is loosely tied together with some major event; humanity is threatened, a group of heroes is sent to try to save the world, and mankind prevails over nature. The rest of the film is essentially nifty visual effects that don't do much to enhance the plot.So when I saw the first half of Deep Impact, I was amazed. Apart from a brief montage of special effects in the opening sequence (a car crash that simply screams big budget), the movie is one of the first disaster movies I've seen that actually focuses more on the human side of the drama rather than the awesome visual effects that computers can accomplish.Many times during the film, especially during the latter half, I felt myself touched by the realism that the actors and actresses convey. There are moments when you realize how fragile and precious life is, and that's saying something for a film of this budget.While the visual effects are indeed impressive, there are other features that make Deep Impact a necessary film to watch. James Horner's music is strikingly similar to his previous Titanic and Apollo 13 scores, but it is still hauntingly beautiful and fits the tone of the movie perfectly. Tea Leoni does a good job of portraying a newscaster attempting to cover the events surrounding her while dealing with her own personal emotions, which is undoubtedly a hard act to pull off. Elijah Wood shows his skill years before Lord of the Rings hit theaters. The other actors and actresses are very realistic and emotional, and the movie flows smoothly with their presence.All in all, this movie is not one to be missed. Keep an open mind while watching this movie don't watch it with the misconception that it's just going to be another one of those big-budget dull blockbuster films that gets churned out every summer. This one dares to avoid the seemingly standard clichés set by other films of the genre, which makes it a truly unique film to experience.Score 9/10 "},{"Title":"Still good years later","Date":"30 April 2005","Score":"70 out of 96 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":" I just saw this film again after several years.

It was much more realistic than Armageddon(which I think is one of the most overrated 'blockbusters' ever)There are no comic relief characters, no cheesy one-liners and no gorgeous movie stars(no offense to Tea Leoni). The solution to the problem was more real in Deep Impact and the time frame was much more believable. I like how the film focused more on what was happening on earth rather than in the spaceship. The end was interesting because the disaster wasn't totally averted so there was no cheerful hugging in the end with lame Aerosmith playing over it. The only thing that bothered me was that all of the nuclear missiles from the US and Russia had no effect on the comet. Wouldn't several hundred nukes do something? anything? and why wasn't the Messiah destroyed in the blast? So overall, good flick, deserves more credit.

How would you react if you knew that there was no way you were going to survive what was about to happen?  Would you want to survive what was about to happen?  Deep Impact is an excellent film that tells the story of a giant comet that is heading towards earth and unless it is stopped it will destroy everything.  It contains many inter-personal relationships, and it examines how people would react if the end was near.  It doesn't get as deep as Last Night at examining those issues, but what it does better than Last Night and even Armageddon ( another film that I loved ) is it shows a little more about relationships.  It has a father and daughter trying to patch things up before the end is upon them.  It shows young love, parental love and the love for a country and the world we live in.  Deep Impact had a deeper impact on me and I really admire both Hollywood summer films that came out and dealt with this issue.  But Deep Impact has more to say than Armageddon does.One of the things that I admired so much about this film was how Tea Leoni was so hell bent on uncovering a story so that she could move up in the ranks of reporting, and in the process she uncovers something bigger than any political scandal could ever be.  At first she is following a tip about some senator that has retired from office rather urgently.  She has transcripts with him talking about a girl named Ellie.  And she is determined to uncover who Ellie is so she can embarrass the senator and quicken her pursuit to greatness.  She finally confronts the senator on the dock where he is laoding a boat with what looks to be enough supplies to last for a year.  She tries to bully the senator into telling her the story but he refuses.  She then does some research on the Internet and finds out that Ellie wasn't the name of a woman, but an acronym for the comet. E.L.E. Extinction Level Event.  She is horrified.  The beginning takes up a good half an hour of the movie and it is during that thirty mintues that I became hooked.  My emotions were manipulated to the point where I felt like I should  be at home with my family.  The direness of the situation was very well executed.  And the rest of the film is on the same level.  It does a great job at making us ask questions about ourselves.  And we examine our own lives and wonder if we would be prepared if something like this ever happened.  I realize this may be getting a little sentimental and perhaps sappy, but this film really tapped into my emotions and I think it did that to a lot of people.  I highly recommend htis film for all that it is.  The acting is top notch, especially from Morgan Freeman.  He conveys the hurt, confusion and utter regret as the president of the United States.  He knows that it is impossible to save everyone but he has to do what he can to save as many as possible.  He truly is a great and gifted actor.  The score is also a moving orchestra and the direction by Mimi Leder is swift and appropriatly crisp and dizzying in some ways.  I have never heard of her before this, but I heard that Spielberg picked her himself for this project. And he was smart to pick her.  She really does a wonderful job here.Deep Impact is more than just a movie, it is an experience, and one that should be had by all.  A wonderful, wonderful film.

I think the people who don't like it are (1) people expecting it to be a summer blockbuster popcorn movie with a million special effects, or (2) people upset because they think it's cheesy / has scientific errors. Let me address both points.First of all, this is not a disaster movie in the style of Armageddon or Volcano or any of them. It's a movie about humanity's struggle to deal with an impending disaster. And in doing that, it succeeds. Most of the film is supported by strong talent, including Robert Duvall and Morgan Freeman. In smaller roles, Max Schell, Vanessa Redgrave, and Ron Eldard really shine. I was disappointed by Tea Leoni's acting. And Elijah Wood and Leelee Sobieski didn't really do much for me, although they weren't bad.Second, while the movie is not standard Hollywood flair, it doesn't altogether escape the Hollywood curse. There are a few fairly ridiculous moments and plot points. HOWEVER, compared to disaster movies, I have to say this are extremely minor. To counter this, there are some very touching scenes. I don't want to give anything away here, but most of them occur near the end of the film.This is not the best movie ever by any means, but it comes as close as a mainstream Hollywood movie dealing with the end of the world is going to get.

Some kind of soap opera featuring the worst actress of the 20th century Tea Leoni who recites her lines like Lindsey Crouse in House of Games. She sounds Vulcan. Her voice is expressionless, her face blank. Does Mimi know when to say cut? She is lucky the director was not Kubrick; this performance would have never been seen. The comet story occupies perhaps a half hour of this AS THE COMET TURNS; we are plunged into Jennie's coma inducing family problems about her Mommy and daddy. Pity two great actors Redgrave and Schell who really must have needed money. This is not enough for Leder, no when get Leo and his squeeze thrown in just in case jenny's problems were not enough. It features the biggest plot hole in a film they saved extra nukes WHY? They knew exactly how much to use, why use extra? Maybe they were on sale and they do make attractive end tables. Please, they would have used every one they brought with them they are there so the ADD screenwriter, who is concentrating on those fascinating domestic problems, perhaps should have devoted more time to the comet story? Yes? What an obvious and insulting plot contrivance to give our bad acting heroes a way to save the day. How about the gooey, ending where every living relative of our soon to be extra crispy astronauts has to be paraded before the camera to wring every possible tear from the audience? It comes with the most nauseating score; it is so over the top and maudlin. Finally, the last 20 minutes of the movie we get to that irrelevancy; you know, the comet hitting the earth. Also, notice, unlike Armageddon, Leder seems to think the United States is the entire earth. Duvall does what he can but he is the only actor in the whole cast. Redgrave and Schell have bit parts. Tea is beyond bad; she wrecks the movie. Her delivery is so insouciant even when there is supposed to be emotion. When it was made she faced universal blame for the bad reception the film received. If you wish to make Steel Magnolias fine, just do not advertise an action, adventure picture.

I remembered enjoying it the first time quite a lot and wanted to see how it held up after all those years. Verdict? I honestly can't imagine what I was thinking that first time and how I could ever call this film quality entertainment. Most likely my teenage brain stopped at giant asteroid destroying Earth - sooooo cool!, because this film does not have much to offer beyond that.With a global disaster movie you can go one of three basic ways. One, you can get serious and make it all about the big picture - realistic what-ifs, governments' reactions, impact on society, scientific background. Two, you can make it all about the characters - focus on a small group, real and interesting enough to make the audience genuinely care about them. Three, go for pure popcorn entertainment, with great production values and a huge spectacle that never takes itself too seriously. Combinations are possible too - my favorite example is World War Z (the book, not the film), which skillfully combines the first two approaches.Deep Impact is a complete failure, no matter which template you compare it to.The big picture part is unbelievably stupid, as if the writers had a single afternoon to come up with reasonably realistic ways this scenario might play out, and on top of that never bothered to talk to anyone who deals with actual real world disasters. The idea of everyone just going about their daily lives up to the last moment instead of putting a sizable portion of the nation's resources into preparing the majority of the population for the aftermath is too dumb for words. The idea of millions of people dying in the first impact because despite knowing months in advance about it, no one thought to evacuate the coast may be even worse.The characters are equally awful. First of all, there are too many of them. There's only time for a brief introduction and as a result no one goes beyond a cardboard cutout with a couple of ham-handedly presented personality traits. The ones we're supposed to care about - Jenny and Leo with their families - are merely devices for generating artificial drama. Their idiotic actions are supposed to make the audience sympathize with them and feel their emotions. In my case they made me wish the tsunami would hurry up and wash them away already (with the sole exception of Jenny's mother, who I thought was rather interesting and well played).Finally, Deep Impact is too cheap, too serious and too boring to be successful in the last category - pure, silly fun. The special effects are third rate, the humor non-existent and the plot slowly stumbles towards one of the least satisfying endings in the history of the disaster film genre. The climax should either tie up all the parts of the plot into a nice, satisfying package, or leave us wondering about what happens next - on the big, planetary scale, as well as with the characters we've come to care about. In Deep Impact the character are either killed by their unfathomable stupidity pretending to be deep sentiment and romantic natures, or they simply disappear, their future fate unknown and unimportant (though I imagine quite a lot of regrets in their future, concerning the needless deaths of their loved ones). The big picture is narrowed down to an optimistic speech and the image of reconstruction of a single part of a single country (which seems to stand for the entirety of human race in this case).Ultimately the film that features one of the greatest natural disasters imaginable ends not with a bang, but with a disinterested whimper. Which could be considered quite an achievement, but not the kind I would give any stars for.

DANTE'S PEAK and VOLCANO both came out at the same and both featured volcanoes suddenly exploding into life , and there's several other examples of this unimaginative  let's makes a movie similar to a studio rival  movie pitch from the 1990s . Perhaps the best example is DEEP IMPACT and Armageddon which feature a giant comet going to collide with planet Earth . I should point out though that both movies were pitched to different audiences . Armageddon is marketed to the unthinking macho American audience . It stars Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck , is directed by Michael Bay and is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer so unsurprisingly it's a pile of expensive effects laden bubblegum . DEEP IMPACT came out a couple of months previously and is by far the better movie . However it is flawed I think the problem with DEEP IMPACT is that it's probably produced to appeal to women . The main protagonist is female and there's several sub plots involving family issues (  Gee Mom I hope the end of the world doesn't ruin my weekend  ) , oh and a bit of romance too . This doesn't ruin the movie but I did find the heroine's trembling lip and tears in her eyes in every emotional scene grating and the movie does lapse into terrible mawkishness several times . I also found the concept of a  lottery draw  to send people into deep bunkers where they have a chance of surviving the apocalypse unconvincing . Yeah right I sure the American president is going to give trailer trash and red necks to chance to come live with him . America might be a classless society but it's not that classless and considering Bill Clinton ( Often described as  America's first black president ) was in the White House at the time do we think that either men or ugly women would have a chance of being selected ? About as much chance as Bill inviting Hilary into the bunker I imagine There are a few good points about the movie that stops it becoming an overproduced disease of the week movie . One thing is the cast , Armageddon had Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck while DEEP IMPACT has Morgan Freeman and Robert Duvall . Do I have to spell out what movie has the better cast ? Okay DEEP IMPACT isn't a career highpoint for either actor but they do bring serious class to the production and there's lots of familiar faces on screen like Frodo Baggins and the bad guy from MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2 . The special effects are very good and there is one absolutely superb scene on a highway where thousands of bickering people are in gridlock , they slowly stop arguing and fighting amongst themselves as they look up and see the meteor pass overhead . On paper this scene might have seemed ineffective but on screen it's breath taking with a deep emotional impactSo in my humble opinion DEEP IMPACT is the better of the two movies and is probably the best comet/meteor movie ever made .

Its Tuesday night and I don't want to start on my homework yet, so I thought I would give this classic a view.Now, I'm not an astronomy major, but I'm pretty sure an Earth killing comet would be spotted by someone other than a group of snotty nose kids in a field, since, yanno, people look for comets all of the time. Furthermore, there is no way the Government, which can't even keep itself funded half of the time could keep the news secret, since eventually you would be able to SEE the comet with your naked eye. Also, blowing a comet up only creates more chucks of ice, that basically equals the mass of the entire comet. Therefore, you would not only still have to deal with the full effects of the impact, but debris would hit more places around the globe.The science in this movie is bad, but considering this was probably a summer blockbuster aimed at basically stealing 7 bucks from dumb Americans its OK. What is NOT OK is the acting, and the actions several characters take. There are several characters that behaved so stupidly and unnaturally I couldn't list them all if I tried, so I'll focus on the dumbest. 12 year old Leo, the kid that found the comet gets married (lol) to his 12 year old girlfriend. They are offered a spot underground and will survive the Comet. Leo's girlfriend decides she wants to DIE with her mom and dad. Young Leo can't accept this, and turns away to go get his girlfriend, AFTER YOUNG LEO AND HIS PARENTS HAVE ALREADY TRAVELED TO THE OZART MOUNTAINS IN MISSOURI, THOUSANDS OF MILES FROM THEIR VIRGINIA HOMES. Young Leo's parents say aww, OK, here is a WATCH SO YOU CAN TRADE WITH PEOPLE ON YOUR WAY 3000 MILES BACK TO OUR OLD HOUSE, BE SAFE SON. What parents in their right minds would allow this. You're sending your 12 year old son out into a world that will be on FIRE I 20 minutes with no realistic way of evening getting out of the parking lot before impact. Also, remember, this girl CHOSE to STAY with her parent and DIE in a tidal wave, rather than be with Leo. I used to be 12 years old, and every girl I meet was the one. I would never leave a secure location to go be with a girl that would literally rather DIE IN A TIDAL WAVE than LIVE with me.Anyway, Leo somehow makes it across the country, back to his Virginia house in less than 10 minutes with no means of transportation, and finds his lover in traffic. This time, she RELUCTANTLY agrees to go with him, 10 minutes before the comet slams into the ocean. Young Leo outruns a tidal wave moving 1100 MPH on a scooter. Let me say that again. Young Leo outruns a tidal wave moving at 1100 MPH on a scooter. I guess that makes sense considering he got from the Ozark Mountains in Missouri to Virginia in 10 minutes walking. Maybe HE should have been tasked with blowing up the comet.Oh, I almost forgot about the ending. The idiots in space nuke the 2nd chuck of comet, saving the planet. Like I said before, the energy released from the comet would have the same effect regardless if its a solid body or broken up into chucks. Would you rather have 1000 nuclear bombs explode in one place, or 1000 places? Just Stupid. I can't believe this movie turned a profit and I can't believe its considered a classic. Morgan Freeman should demand his name by deleted from the credits. Just imagine watching a bad soap opera, music and all, wrapped in a disaster movie. I didn't even discuss the reporter. Awful. This is what I get for procrastinating on homework.

But DEEP IMPACT is enriched tenfold by this deliberate shift of emphasis, even though the film adheres to a routine formula established years earlier in such disaster pics as EARTHQUAKE and THE TOWERING INFERNO (both 1974). Here, the contrived melodrama of those older movies is replaced by a sincere contemplation of unimaginable catastrophe and the subsequent effect on mankind, highlighted by Morgan Freeman's authoritative presence as the beleaguered US president, who commissions a group of astronauts (led by Robert Duvall) to land a spacecraft on the comet and attach a series of nuclear devices to the surface.Proceedings are hindered slightly by Téa Leoni's blank-faced performance as the TV journalist who stumbles onto the impending cataclysm whilst researching an apparently unrelated story about a 'philandering' senator (James Cromwell). Thankfully, the film is redeemed by its tremendous supporting cast, including Vanessa Redgrave as Leoni's proud mother, struggling to cope following her divorce from estranged husband Maximilian Schell, and a pre-hobbit Elijah Wood, playing the juvenile lead. It's to the filmmakers' credit that all these characters (and more besides) play vital roles within the overall structure, adding depth and resonance to an otherwise crowd-pleasing commercial enterprise.The climactic scenes of destruction - involving a huge tidal wave striking New York - are brief but potent, precisely because of the human dimension stressed by Leder's intuitive direction. True, the outcome is fairly predictable, and there's a slight lurch into artificial sentimentality towards the end of the movie, but these are minor drawbacks in an otherwise worthy production. Fine music score by James Horner.

This was not one of your 'everything's going to be OK in the end' movies. When I first watched it, I was actually surprised when Biederman struck Earth. I was thinking it would be one of those down to the last minute but in the end all is well type things. The striking scene and the ones that followed of the devastation were breathtaking. Rather than disregard scientific laws and reasoning, Deep Impact embraces it and includes it in the film.What I liked most about this movie was that it provided what could have been a real picture into what would happen should a comet be on course for Earth. The panic, widespread fear, and the tough decision to move only so many people into 'The Arc' made this a surprisingly moving film.The acting is mostly superb as well. Morgan Freeman puts out an amazing performance as the President, and Robert Duvall is first class, as is Maximilliam Schell. The only performance that brought this movie down was that of Tea Leoni. I like Tea as an actress, just not in this role. She was the only one who seemed out of place in an otherwise well-casted movie. Her dark, pessimistic broodings did not go over well. She was just too stiff and rigid to play a character like Jenny Lerner.Deep Impact works on many levels because of the humanistic underlying tones. Humanity has never faced such a crisis before, and God forbid we never have to, however if it were to come to pass, I believe that this movie provides the best window into a catastrophic future. By far the most complete, through, moving disaster movie made. Well worth watching, especially the comet striking sequence. You'll be moved, I guarantee it.

MISREPRESENTATION. We all hate when we see the trailer and think we are going to see a certain kind of film; we pay the money, buy popcorn sit down and are shown something completely different than what we were promised. Look, Mimi Leder can make all the maudlin goo she wants I am sure there is an audience for her tripe out there; look how good the soap operas have been doing since the advent of television? We were promised a comet hitting the earth movie and we get about 30 minutes of film devoted to this theme. The rest of the picture is AS THE COMET TURNS. It focuses on what I consider to be the single worst acting performance of the 20th century be an actress in a leading role Tea Leoni. If you want to see why she went back to television; rent this movie. She sounds truly like one of the Borg; cold, emotionless recitation of lines without one trace of inflection, abysmal. This is your lead actress. We then are plunged into her utterly BORING AND IRRELEVANT family problems with her estranged parents. The comet story has to wait till we get all their pressing domestic problems worked out. Jenny and her mommie and daddy do not like each other. BOO-HOO. The problem with putting Leoni with Redgrave and Schell is that they were great actors and when she is in scenes with them, she destroys the credibility of the scene. The movie has the worst plot hole of any film I know of; for some reason, the astronauts decided to save some nuclear weapons from the initial detonation on the comet. Evidently, they knew exactly how much they needed; why use more? So they saved some for later; hey, you never know when nuclear weapons could come in handy. It is so obviously a plot contrivance by the ADD screenwriter to save the day and it is has zero believability. Mimi is not happy with just AS THE COMET TURNS the older years; she also does AS THE COMET TURNS the younger generation with Leo and his squeeze. It is done so very poorly; badly acted and yes I do not mean to insult soap operas which this movie is quite inferior to. At least they know what they want to be; Mimi, ah dear? you remember the comet honey? Could we get back to that pretty soon? The ending is legendarily bad. The soon to be extra crispy astronauts have to have every living relative even babies paraded before the camera to the most syrupy score; next time you need to vomit put the ending on. It is such an insult to the viewer; try not to so shamelessly milk the audience for tears. Yes, the last 20 minutes, when Mimi finally gets around to that irrelevancy, you know the comet hitting the earth, is very well done. It angered me for I thought how great a film this might have been in the hands of a more talented director. It is not what it purports to be; it is an over two hour badly acted soap opera. Yes, Max and Vanessa are great but they are barely on screen. Tea Leoni takes a wrecking ball to the script; in my audience, many people laughed at her terrible performance.

No one reacted realistically. The characters on the rescue ship made efforts at showing some human emotion, but they came off as wooden and dull.

Now, if this had have been achieved then this would be a very good movie, cheesy but still a good movie. But it fails rather miserably to do any of these things because it is killed by three main factors; terrible pacing, complete lack of character development and a pretty awful, cliché dependent script not to mention the below par acting by many of the actors. As a result of all this, I felt absolutely zero emotional attachment to any of the characters which in a movie so heavy with sentiment, is a huge failure in itself. Also, I never felt excited or gripped by any of the action or suspenseful scenes because they would always be ruined by the never ending cheesy lines of dialogue or the shoddy special effects and I almost lost all interest near the end. The sad thing is, even with a little better character development, this could have been a far better movie if it didn't feel like I was being forced to care about the under developed romance of the two teenagers who have a combined screen time of about 20 minutes or the irritating reporter with the personality of a spoon.Now, compare this to it's unintentional but obvious counterpart, Armageddon, which may just be a big dumb blockbuster as well but it still makes me well up, get goosebumps, laugh and smile with joy in so many memorable scenes because of it's likable protagonists, satisfactory character development & plot, great pacing and fantastic cinematography, music & special effects. That's what makes a good blockbuster, Deep Impact, on the other hand made me feel none of this and really pales in comparison in my opinion.I give it a generous 3 out of 10.

Sometimes I am a little nervous about audiences, thinking that they are going to crunch popcorn and talk through the film whilst spitting on the ceiling etc. Sometimes I am right. In this case I was not happy to find myself in the middle of a bunch of young men who were greatly amused by the fact that they could annoy their neighbours by making their seats squeak and who broke out in gales of laughter over an advert featuring a weak joke about frothing beer cans and babes in swimsuits. I fully expected to spend more time trying to filter out their noise than watching the film. The film began without titles with an attention-grabbing opening. The previously noisy lads subsided immediately and never made another sound throughout the two and a half hours of the film except to laugh at the funny bits, gasp at the gaspy bits and surreptitiously wipe away a tear at the emotional bits. Now, if I was a clever Guardian-type critic I could leave it that and not tell you a single other thing about Deep Impact. The audience reaction says it all.An Everest-sized comet is heading towards the earth and threatens to extinguish all life thereon. But we know, because we've seen the trailer beforehand, that a brave group of astronauts will be trying to head it off by placing nukes on it. We also know that at least part of the comet is going to hit the earth because, again, we've seen the trailer. In between finding out about the approaching nemesis and the final effects-laden ending we follow the lives of a young man who discovered the comet, the president of the US of A (Morgan Freeman), the team of astronauts led by a grisly bit lovable old Robert Duvall and a journalist (Tea Leoni) who breaks the story and becomes the top news anchor, broadcasting the events as they unfold. This is also a film which makes full use of a large cast of supporting actors often culled from TV shows like Hill Street Blues and E.R. The whole thing is directed by Mimi Leder, herself a graduate of E.R. and the recent Clooney-led Peacemaker.One of the first things to strike me was how good the script is and what a verbose film it is. People are talking to each other all the time and many of the scenes are full of busy newsrooms or presidential Q and A sessions or mission control rooms. I suppose I shouldn't be too surprised, given the background of the people involved, but the busy scenes with intercutting dialogues and story strands work just as well on the big screen as they do on TV. Special mention must also go to the idea of how Leoni gets into the plot &#x96; this was a really clever idea, well written and expertly handled. To tell you what it is would be to spoil it, though you can figure it out from the trailer (damn trailers! I think the time has come to ban them). This is a people film as much, if not more than, it is an effects film and the script mostly does a good job of making you care about them and believe in them. Just occasionally it strays into heavy-handed manipulation of the emotions but it is difficult to see how this could be otherwise, given the subject matter. The American gung-honess also comes out in Freeman's president but it's best to ignore these bits as they are few and far between. (What do you expect? This is an American film made by Americans primarily for consumption by Americans).As far as the acting is concerned everyone with a decent bit of script does well. Leoni is particularly good and always manages to convey that feeling of I really don't know what the hell is going on but I'm getting away with it  that the story demands of her. Robert Duvall, an American national treasure, is excellent as the world-weary astronaut and this was a bold piece of casting when you imagine some suit trying to argue that the part should be played by Leonardo Di Caprio or some other infant. I suspect that the film could have managed without the young astronaut part but Elijah Wood manages to look suitably youthful and enthusiastic, as does his girlfriend. Morgan Freeman gets away with playing the president because he is Morgan Freeman though his was the most cardboard cut-out character in the whole piece.So what is wrong with the film then? Well I've already mentioned the president &#x96; ugh! I was a little disappointed with the depiction of events on the street. I feel sure that there would be much more violence if this happened for real and the rows and rows of motorists waiting patiently for death by drowning were far too stoic about their fates. The FX were also a little patchy. Sometimes they were really excellent but at other times you could see the joins and the models. Perhaps we are all getting too blasé in these days when every other film destroys half the world or flies starships twice around the universe. All the same I was faintly disappointed by a few of the FX shots.

I thought the screenplay was actually a bit better than your typical disaster film as it allowed the viewers to really connect with the majority of the characters as well as feel like you've got a good idea of what was going on in regards to the rescue mission and it certainly treated the viewer like an adult and not just a dumb teen out for some summer blockbuster kicks. Freeman and Duvall certainly help make the film seem all the more realistic with their commanding performances. Freeman really does come across like a real President and his speeches to the nation are very chilling. Hearing Freeman's speech about the end of the world is without question very powerful. Duvall, on the other hand, makes you really believe that he can take this mission on and this here helps this aspect of the film. Téa Leoni is decent, if nothing spectacular, in the role of the reporter but I will admit that her character gets the majority of the silly melodrama. Elijah Wood is also good in his bit and it was nice seeing Charles Martin Smith in his brief role. The special effects in the film are another major plus and especially the scenes in space dealing with the mission to the asteroid. These scenes were very realistic and really sealed home how effective the drama was. DEEP IMPACT isn't a masterpiece but I do think it's one of the better disaster movies out there.

This movie came out not long before Armageddon, but it seems like it was pretty much pounded and bypassed. I think the summer movies that came out after it stole a lot of the thunder, which Deep Impact deserved. The critics were also a bit harsh on it, and I don't think they should've been (but that's just my opinion). The apocalyptic disaster concept is similar to that of Armaggedon, but instead of an asteroid in collision course with the earth, it's a comet, and it's a great movie. Yes, it is. I got it from the library on DVD and watched it, and I loved it.The story starts out as Leo Biederman (Elijah Wood) in Richmond, Virginia, discovers an uncharted object in the night sky and report it to an astronomer in Arizona, who determines that it's a comet and it's on a trajectory that will bring it into collision with the earth. While driving to release this news, the astronomer is killed in a car accident. A year later, in Washington D. C., MSNBC news reporter Jenny Lerner (Téa Leoni) is investigating the resignation of U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, Alan Rittenhouse (James Cromwell), who says he's resigned because his wife is sick. But Jenny, as she investigates further, comes to think he's been cheating on his wife with someone called Ele, and resigned because he was about to be found out. Soon, however, at her computer at the news station, and then at a press conference at which the president (Morgan Freeman) makes an address, Jenny learns her error it's not a mistress named Ele, it's E. L. E. (Extinction Level Event), specifically the comet we learned about at the beginning of the movie. After this, the story really starts to develop, leading to a movie full of emotion, soul, great plot points, recurring themes, and much more.There have been many different types of apocalyptic disaster thrillers, with many different types of plot, tone, characters, and action. Deep Impact takes an excellent approach at the story. It allows one to feel the emotion of the movie, enjoy the special effects, and the action near the end, and at same time feel the emotion of the characters, and still feel the great effect on everybody worldwide. It has an excellent tone and balance. It has very dynamic and developed story lines, and great themes, including, especially in the second half of the movie, the value in life, in the world, in the environment (not mentioned in the film, but can be felt), etc. It even gets a bit existential toward the end, which I like. All of the story lines are fully appreciated, an none really outdoes the other. They balanced them very well - the Jenny Lerner storyline, the Leo Biederman storyline, and all the others. Also, the movie was well- cast, and I thought it was well-acted, and the characters were very well set up and developed. Man, it's really hard to put into words what I felt about the movie.My viewing experience of this film was great. This film started out, and then gradually captured my interest and liking more and more, all the while developing it's dynamic tone, characters, story, and emotion. The actors, even the well known Morgan Freeman, really blended into their roles - I really saw them as their characters. By the time the movie ended, I loved it. It also has good special effects which I enjoyed, but the core of the film, what I really loved about it, was the story, the soul, and the emotion. The movie certainly pries deep into emotions during it's nearly two hour running time. It has everything a great movie really needs. Even the action at the midpoint of the film and near the end was good, it has the strong emotional and soul-filled background and tone to back it up &#x96; it's not just full-out summer action - and it actually matters what happens to the characters during these action scenes. What if the world really were coming to an end soon? This movie really pries deep into the emotional aspect of that question. Deep Impact is an underrated, misunderstood gem.My Rating **** (out of ****)For more reviews, please visit my website http//robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com "},{"Title":"Outstanding!","Date":"14 September 2010","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":" Science-Fiction Disaster films have always caught attention.

Like most of its genre there are rather too many characters who didn't do anything to further the plot; for example a lot of time is spent on the school boy who first spotted the comet even though he takes no further role in the attempt to stop the comet. Likewise once the story of the comet broke the reporter didn't contribute much beyond a human interest element although to be fair Téa Leoni did a good job and kept her character interesting.Morgan Freeman did a fine job as the US president although he is the sort of actor who could make reading the phone book seem statesmanlike and Robert Duvall puts in a good performance as the ageing astronaut astronaut leading the mission that is attempting to destroy the rogue comet before it hits the Earth.The special effects for the comet weren't too great by current standards but when I was watching that scene I didn't realise the film was so old until later on when we see that the Twin Towers were still standing in New York. I liked the effects of the tsunami when the smaller comet hit though. Given that it was a disaster movie surprisingly there was hardly anything after the disaster struck, the whole story was taken up by how people prepared for the impending disaster rather then seeing how people cope once an unexpected disaster strikes as was the standard in the 1970s when disaster movies were all the rage. Personally I rather liked this difference. I wouldn't recommend buying this unless you are a fan of the genre or it is in the bargain bin but it is certainly worth watching if it is on television.

The real plus for this movie is the idea of sacrifice displayed throughout different points in the movie. The basic storyline is about a comet heading towards Earth that is sighted by an astronomy student, played by Elijah Wood, and his girlfriend during a student outing. The info is passed onto a scientist who is killed but somehow gets the information to the authorities and they start preparing for what needs to be done and the consequences if it doesn't work. They decide to send a group of astronauts out to blow it up and send it off course so it won't hit the Earth. A reporter, played by Teo Leoni, finds out about this secret before the government is ready to reveal everything to the world and her career is furthered because of this. She becomes anchorwoman and we also get to find out bits and pieces about her life as the movie goes on. Another storyline that is kind of wacky is about an underground tunnel-like lair that the U.S. build to house important people and also those who win spots in a lottery. This part of the plot is a little lame but the heart of the story is really still intact. Overall this movie is an enjoyable and learning experience about the positive impact on humankind when they are put under these type of circumstances. This is really where the movie shines despite some of the silly plot twists and this is why I recommend this drama/thriller about the possible annihilation of mankind.

Both feature classic disaster-movie structure (as more or less invented by Irwin Allen), but there is a big difference between these films. As you'd expect from director Michael Bay, Armageddon is all show and no go - it's filled with lots of top-notch eye candy and visual effects, but that's ALL it has to offer. The characters and story are typical of Michael Bay, which means they are all boring, cheesy stereotypes offering nothing beyond Hollywood clichés. This film might as well be called Hollywood Meteor Movie. On the other hand, Deep Impact takes a very realistic look at what would happen if a comet really was on course for Earth. Events are depicted with believability and, for the most part, you care about what happens to the characters. Yes, there is some cheese factor involved, so the movie isn't perfect, but the movie's heart is in the right place. I, for one, appreciate the attempt to tell a realistic story and not just create a vehicle for special effects.

I desperately tried to feel something for Leelee Sobieski and Elijah Woods characters because I think those actors are particularly good ones. But again I didn't care that they were about to be seperated...I just wanted them to get off the screen and not because of their acting but because the script gave them nothing to work with. I have seen most of themain actors in other things so I can safely say that its not their acting thats so horrible. And I think I can pinpoint the reason why I didn't care about these characters and their predicaments. There were so many characters nad the film switched between them all so often that the audience wasn't given a chance to get to know any of them. There were the parents of Wood and Sobieski, Wood and SObieski themselves, Laura Innes and her baby, the journalist and her father, the spaceship crew and their families...if the movie had simply concentrated on a few select characters then maybe I would have gotten into it a little more.

This disaster is going to be one of world wide significance. A comet discovered by some kids in a high school astronomy club is calculated to be on the way to earth and will be there in a few years. It all begins so innocently as the kids from a high school astronomy club are making their observations. Elijah Wood notices an object in space that shouldn't be there and it isn't twinkling as stars do. He takes a picture and sends it to astronomer Charles Martin Smith. Who tracks it on a collision course with earth and then gets killed rushing to give those in authority the news.The rest of the film plays like your Seventies disaster film as a cross section of citizens try to figure out what to do with what could be a very short remainder of their lives. Morgan Freeman who is the president of the United States institutes martial law and a lottery of selected citizens who are to be put into underground shelters in the limestone caves of Missouri. How that lottery effects the cast constitutes the remainder of the film.Some folks are chosen for their celebrity. Elijah Wood who discovered the comet gets saved with his family, his next door neighbor and fellow astronomer wonk Leelee Sobieski doesn't. Tea Leoni is the MSNBC news reporter who suspects something major is afoot also gets to go. She's torn between mother Vanessa Redgrave and father Maximilian Schell who are separated and Schell has taken a trophy wife in Rya Kihlstedt. She gets a pass because of her celebrity status in breaking the comet story.There's a team of astronauts up there trying to save the situation headed by Robert Duvall. Initially all they do is break off a small section of the comet. One of them gets killed and the rest go home to die. I have to say that I liked Morgan Freeman as president best. We haven't had as commanding a presence in the White House in real life for quite a few years now. He's the man in authority I would like to see in a crisis. Secondly Elijah Wood and Leelee Sobieski are really great as the young people who must survive, intelligent, progressive looking and free from a lot of the garbage that has passed. It was a matter of seconds before Sobieski in her telescope might have discovered the comet that Wood did. The unfairness of it all is truly frightening.That final scene of Washington, DC after the tidal wave has struck is impressive. It reminded me so much of the picture's Lincoln's first inaugural with the unfinished Capitol Dome in the background, symbol as commentators said at the time of an unfinished union. The Capitol standing disheveled, but still standing was a great symbol of humankind's unconquerable spirit. Gloria Gaynor said it best, I Will Survive.Some nice special effects connected with a group of interesting stories with people that you care about, that's Deep Impact.

In spite of its best intentions to blend epic disaster with a great big human heart, Deep Impact neither appeased the sci-fi crowd or fulfilled the effects hungry popcorn brigade's gargantuan appetites. Too talky said one side of the cinema, that's just ridiculous said the other, hey isn't this supposed to be a corny disaster film asked the balcony, here in lays the problem. Director Mimi Leder and her writing team of Bruce Rubin and Michael Tolkin are guilty of not taking a side from which to launch their picture out of the mundane atmosphere. Or perhaps maybe, it was just a bold gamble that didn't pay off? but i'm sure nobody involved in the picture would have wanted the viewers to be hankering for the effects laden finale, and that's what happens, ultimately it's the so-so carnage that most end up remembering. Worst still is that outside of Téa Leoni's news lady central character, Jenny Lerner, no characters are fully formed to make us even care if they and the Earth actually survives. Which in a film pro porting to be an intimate study of relationships and how mankind copes with impending doom, is nearly unforgivable.It's odd that in the same year as Bruce Willis and Michael Bay firmly went for the popcorn crowd with Armageddon, that Deep Impact was offered up as the thinking mans opposite side of the coin. Yet the reality is that Deep Impact got confused about its worth, and sadly falls some way short of being the fine movie that it obviously looked like being down on the page. A good cast is wasted and a brave move is sadly unrealised. 5/10 because deep down it does in fact pose some rather interesting questions, questions that at least make Deep Impact worth a revisit on a quiet and boring Sunday evening by the fire, but it's definitely a case of so near and yet so far far away.

One was Michael Bay's preposterous macho action movie Armageddon, the other was Mimi Leder's more serious Deep Impact. The idea was first explored in a very bad late '70s flick entitled Meteor (a Sean Connery film that even Sean Connery fans tend not to remember!) Of all the films to use this admittedly terrifying storyline, I think Deep Impact is probably the best. That's not to say it is, in itself, a great film &#150; merely that it is preferable to the others. Earth's peril in the event of a catastrophic asteroid strike is a terrific concept but one that has never quite been given the treatment it deserves.Young astronomy enthusiast Leo Biederman (Elijah Wood) discovers an uncharted object in space. When his discovery is checked out further, it is discovered that he has sighted a gigantic asteroid on a collision course with Earth! The terrifying news is kept from the public to begin with while various scientists and world governments plan their next move. But ambitious TV news-woman Jenny Lerner (Tea Leoni) gets wind of the plot and confronts the American president Tom Beck (Morgan Freeman) about it. Shortly afterwards, Beck allows the news to go public &#150; a stunned worldwide audience looks on as he announces the countdown to global extinction. The only hope is if a team of American and Russian astronauts led by the experienced Spurgeon Tanner (Robert Duvall) can land on the asteroid and detonate a nuclear device capable of destroying or diverting it. This dangerous mission becomes mankind's final hope of survival. And Jenny Lerner finds herself the news celebrity covering the most important story in the history of the world, as it is she who reports on the space shuttle Messiah's rendezvous with the asteroid. The unthinkable happens - the mission fails, with the nuclear explosion merely splitting the asteroid into two pieces, both still on course to hit the Earth. As time ticks on, everyone braces themselves for the end&#133;.There are some flaws with Deep Impact, of that there can be no argument. The characters on Earth who face up to their inevitable doom are a somewhat dull bunch, and their assorted personal dramas hardly make for engrossing viewing. But the film does become engrossing in certain other aspects &#150; the space mission itself is very interesting, and tries mostly to be believable and serious (very different indeed from the mission envisaged in Armageddon). Also, the decisions made by Morgan Freeman's president are very thought-provoking, especially the concept of a series of caves being prepared so that a handful of humans can go underground for several years, and hopefully one day repopulate the planet. Another flaw with the film is that it falls foul of Hollywood's insistence on optimistic endings. Deep Impact looks set to provide that rarest of commodities - a daringly bleak, hopeless and depressing climax. But at the last moment, phony sentimentality and improbable hope take centre stage, as the film swerves off into the realms of feel-good fantasy. At least we get a glimpse of the scale of destruction an asteroid might leave (the smaller of the chunks does strike Earth, and wipes out the Eastern seaboard of America in a spectacular and quite believable sequence). But this film so nearly had the nerve to go all the way, only for it to wimp-out at the end. Still, an interesting and well-assembled film on many levels.

Some not so. It is a good B movie, with an unfortunately suggestive title (why not just call it, E.L.E.?), with a few first rate effects, particularly at the very end. But you have to wait till the end. Yes, it looks like everyone should have been knocked over by a blast front traveling at what looks like thousands of miles an hour. But . . no. Leoni gets a chance to hug Dad on the beach, as a wave taller than the Empire State building rapidly obscures the horizon. Even the wave strikes way too quickly. The comet hits and brief seconds later, Leoni and Dad get washed away, so it seems. The sign says Virginia Beach 6 miles, and behind it there's this huge roiling sea surge taller than the hills themselves closing in, but not the 'surf wave' that got Leoni. Nevertheless, little unblinking Leo, and 'wife' (a bit much), manage to scoot up a nearby hill as the surge subsides below them? We just saw an Indonesian surge only 6-10 feet high in some places sweep miles inland. This thing would have kept going to the Mississippi. And if Leo made the cover of a national 'news' magazine, what about his TV appearances on the morning shows, instead of a school assembly? I did like the tiny little people scurrying to the far end of the skyscraper rooftop as the bottom of the wave surrounds the building. And the sea behind the wave, shown right after the bouncing liberty head, was well done, too. And so on.So that's one movie. But this is two movies. The other movie is the comet attack, the space ship, the nukes, Bruce Willis . . I mean that Lonesome Dove guy, oh . . Robert Duvall, Jon Favreau (before his disastrous plunge in Zathura), and some others. They drive the nukes. They drill 'em. They stomp on 'em - the nukes, that is. They reach depth only to lose Favreau as he floats into space. But when they detonate, it just splits the comet, and doesn't budge it from its trajectory one bit. Ooops. And blowing the rest next to it won't budge either from their trajectories? No? Anyway.The film had some decent actors, who seemed a bit overwhelmed, perhaps, by the somewhat banal script - a few maybe phoning it in. No, I didn't get that sense from Denise Crosby, particularly at the parting scene before the sea surge gets them, which we don't actually see. That was a fairly memorable moment in the film. The rest of the time, yes, she looks like she's on sedatives. But maybe it's the direction she was given, or the script she had to work with. Woods, you notice, doesn't blink much; for which he prided himself if you listen to the LOTR DVD commentaries. But with two movies in one, it's a large ensemble cast. It's not a deep look into personality, though the failing here is that it tries to be, in both movies.Tea Leoni is the puzzle. In some scenes, as with her mother for drinks at the very beginning, she seems to show some confidence, some depth, and then . . . for so much of the rest of the movie, she just doesn't seem to know what attitude to adopt. Is she supposed to be nervous when first in front of the network camera, or jittery, or just goofy? She seems to struggle with the very sets, themselves. I don't know. Did she lose her confidence in some early shoot, or was this a calculated 'character insight'? She certainly is appealing for a suggestion of intelligence, and the lack of any overly personal sarcasm or nagging. She seems beautiful and unthreatening. But she seemed so darned - nervous. In real life, I doubt even CNN would have her reading along with the other clones.And it's also a mystery why in a 'human interest' film, not trying to be just another disaster movie, a main story deals with Tea and family, who are just as boring as can be.

What about the conceited guy - I need graphics! - from the newsroom, and how he dealt, or didn't? It would have been far more interesting not merely to see more interesting people, with even more gripping tales to tell, but people from the coast of Spain, say, or England, North Africa, Jersey (heck), all also threatened, ultimately, by a wave apparently no one could predict until just a few hours ahead of time. And why is that? And why isn't everybody taking the M1 carbines and AKs to the nearest abandoned old mine with truckloads of pressure treated shoring lumber, and whatever else? or staking out the mountaintop? Why aren't the bandits attacking the limestone bunkers? It's life or death. There should be pitched battles, with only half of these bus convoys even making it through. Everyone just sits around and waits for the government to act? Life goes on? like Mrs. Will Smith is ID4 heading to her usual strip club gig with a 3-mile-diameter flying saucer floating overhead? Of course. Everyone is so well-behaved. The film suffered from cheap contrivance, clichéd characters and script, but most of all because the important 'human interest' just wasn't that interesting for most of the film, and was fairly inappropriate given the size of the cast for both movies. A film that coulda been great. Instead . . . it was just a miscalculation.

I mean, I'm not a fan of CGI, as its usually just misused and gets to rule the movie above plot and everything. In Deep Impact, this (thank god) isn't the case, the CGI effects are just splendid - in the scenes where the comet zoomed trough Earth's atmosphere, that just got my heart beating at a pace I've never experienced before in a movie - totally incredible sequence! I dare say it is among the best and most science-accurate CGI-sequences I've ever seen - on the side with the journey in Contact, and other scenes elsewhere.All taken together, I say Deep Impact is a good movie, although there's always room for improvement. I give it a final rating of 7+ out of 10, for good plot, great atmosphere (at most part), and all together a good drama/disaster movie.

Deep Impact doesn't have the cosmic character of WWC. But it has its own charms, and I think should be appreciated as a character drama. Unlike Armageddon, the vastly-inferior film in which Bruce Willis saves the Earth, Deep Impact is about everyday characters whose world is about to end. They must make choices, not so much about their own survival (though some make those choices), but in many cases about how they will deal with NOT surviving. I found it a very personal movie, one where the characters really affected me. While there is a great deal of excitement and action, the performances of Vanessa Redgrave, Maximilian Schell, and Robert Duvall all display heroism in one way or another. Some of the characters display great heroism in the big sense; others display a much smaller heroism of keeping their dignity when they could give in to panic and futility. I don't think it's a perfect movie, by any stretch of the imagination. There are spots where continuity is strained a bit, where you think, 'now how did we get HERE'. There are a couple of coincidences that certainly caused me to suspend my suspension of disbelief.

With many other disaster movies, i find myself looking forward to the doomsday event, or the huge E.L.E. In this i found myself actually worried for the characters. Its so easy to relate to them. If you try and put yourself in the situation, i found it difficult to think what i could do differently. The message behind the disaster is love for family, friends and for the people even closer than them and multiple touching scenes that almost bring a tear to the eye really make you care for what happens. By far the most emotional moment comes from Jenny Lerner and her father, but i'm not giving anything away.Currently on IMDb this film has a 6.0/10 rating which, as the review title suggests, i think is ridiculous.

A great wave not only takes down the Statue of Liberty, it decapitates her! Director Mimi Leder and screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin are very big on tearful goodbyes that let's keep a stiff upper-lip mentality which allows couples (married or otherwise) to stare lovingly into each other's eyes, whispering dedications as death looms above. LeeLee Sobieski's entire role is based on a series of these teary farewells; she's so dead-set on staying with her doomed parents that her character takes on a suicidal edge. Yes, she's in denial, but her suffering seems to go on forever, and by the end a frustrated viewer could possibly be excused for screaming, Stop whimpering and move! How are the effects? Very good when they finally arrive (about four minutes before the film wraps up). Some of the incidentals during the final devastation are suspect, such as a two-second shot of an elderly man getting hit with the wave from behind while he's sitting outside reading the paper (is he in denial too?). I would think that the lottery-aspect of the plot (wherein people are picked at random to live underground for 2 years) would be more exciting than reporter Tea Leoni sniffing out a juicy story. The movie seems to start at much too early a point, with introductions to the characters and to an asteroid exploration team that just chews up time on the clock. There's also the time-worn idea about what books should survive (not Huckleberry Finn and Moby Dick again! Hasn't Rubin's thought process matured beyond 1960?). Naturally, it's we Americans who suffer on the screen. There's a tidbit late in the film wherein Freeman talks about Europe and Africa suffering from the meteor's destruction, but it's shucked off as basic info. The filmmakers don't care about the lost lives and homeless injured of other continents, they have their own agenda. By letting the Americans scream and cry and crawl through the debris, they can also let them triumph over all this tragedy--enough for a feel-good finish. But if Bruce Rubin thinks these stock characters are the most powerful representation of America's suffering own, then it is he who has been hit with a 7-mile-long hunk of rock. *1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"You can't help but feeling empathy for these well-acted characters","Date":"31 May 2005","Score":"8 out of 15 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":" I always glance in amazement at those people who tell me that, yes, Armageddon isn't a masterpiece, but at least it is enjoyable and you care about the characters.

There are some flaws in the plot, both scientifically and as regards continuity and some coincidences that basically don't happen in ordinary life. But there is quite a lot to enjoy. I'm not an avid fan of flicks dealing with the possible end of the world or of the human race (like, as I said before, Armageddon - and then Independence Day, Godzilla, and so on) but this one shines in its own right, as an earnest attempt to create a series of three-dimensional characters in an action-based film and take time to show their intimate side. The writers and the actors deserve some praise to have put up a gallery of men and women you can't help to care about. A lot of critical reviews about this film deal with the boredom they have suffered from watching Deep Impact... but what about the hour and a half of total mess and dumb dialogue armageddon is filled with? And you tell me that you care about the characters? Please. There should be characters first!For example, like Téa Leoni's Jenny a young reporter in search of a scoop who finds herself projected in front of a camera having to tell the entire world what destiny it is facing, while she is struggling with her family's complicated and sad past. Vanessa Redgrave's Robin, Jenny's mother, a woman who should have been born in another century, devastated from her not recent at all but painful divorce - yet, still worried of saving her seventeenth-century desktop by donating it to the National Gallery, and concerned about her make-up and dress when she decides to commit suicide. Robert Duvall's brave but sweet Captain Fish, last man on the Moon, who gradually becomes a father for his crew and, ultimately, for all mankind. Elijah Wood and Leelee Sobieski's Leo and Sarah, the two teenagers strongly in love with each other, a symbol for all the people who desperately struggle to survive. Morgan Freeman as the President, and then Laura Innes, Maximilian Schell, Mary McCormack, all provide touching supportive performances.If you feel in the mood of watching an action flick with a different perspective, watch Deep Impact, and you won't help but care about the men and women involved in a believable enough disaster. If you want to eat a popcorn after another, rent Armageddon and enjoy the mess.

The premise itself is quite interesting; a world preparing for the inevitable extinction-level-event that will occur, but like the work of Roland Emmerich, the story is stretched far too thin, exploring too many characters.Any aspect of the story; the child who first found the meteor, the journalist who first uncovers the government conspiracy, the astronauts who try to stop the comet before it hits earth, or the older woman facing her inevitable demise, could've been their own standalone film, but instead the filmmakers decided to push everything into a single film, making every aspect shallow and rushed.By far my favourite part of the movie are the astronauts. The scene where they plant bombs on the comet in attempts to destroy or alter its course, is by far the most dramatic and emotionally resonant aspect of the film. The effects were also very good for the time. Thankfully, a movie called Sunshine with a similar but different premise explored this sort of story further. The worst part of the story is the kid's story. This kid discovered the comet that would destroy the earth, and all he cares about is boning some girl (and this is made clear in the film, when one of his classmates says in front of an entire school You can have sex with any girl you want for discovering the comet), to the point where he convinces her to marry him to save her family. That is really offensive and creepy, and shouldn't have ever been treated with the whimsy this film did. He could've used his apparent authority to save more people, perhaps his entire class, but instead he marries a 14 year old girl.The rest of the film is decent to mediocre. The President, played by Morgan Freeman, is incredibly interesting, as there is an air of sinister around him when he captures a journalist. But as I said before, most of the film is shallow due to how spread out the film's focus is.In ConclusionPros -Astronaut storyline -Morgan Freeman as President -The Landing on the Comet scene -The impact of the first cometCons -The Soundtrack -The kid storyline -The dialogue -Too many characters6/10 "}{"Title":"I sometimes wonder about the constitutional and election issues in Deep Impact","Date":"11 March 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":" Deep Impact was very moving, especially with Tea Leoni's character reuniting with her father at the end, which was very sad and touching.I still think about the constitutional issues in Deep Impact.

I found myself able to empathize with the characters in this film and felt their pain like it was my own.

I thought the acting was very well done, maybe not Oscar worthy, but very good nonetheless. ***Spoiler*** The only stipulation I had with this film was the scene where Leo and his family are getting ready to go into the caves, Leo decides he's going back for Sarah. His parents just basically give him a hug and wish him well. Lol wut???

You could do a great deal worse, and all of them appear in Deep Impact, giving a backbone of gravitas in a film that takes itself seriously and gets the dividends in this case, being compelling, as well as profoundly moving at regular intervals. It works - we do care about the characters we meet, their fates do matter to us, as of course does the fate of our beloved living, blue planet that has nevertheless had to take its fair share of knocks, had to earn its right to go on over aeons of time. Special effects are entirely adequate here, but they rightly take second place to a great story (well, the biggest possible story, really), and one that is presented realistically and effectively. This is how the film has remained pertinent and effective through to our higher-tech times, and it's very much the above faces that give us an anchor to keep us at least partially in place as one of the biggest storms in history is poised to break on our planet, delivering the same kind of coup de grace that the dinosaurs faced more than 60 million years ago. And then of course there is the remaining anchor in every sense of the word - Jenny Lerner of NBC (shades here of the role played by the real-life Daily Express in the film The Day the Earth Caught Fire, which is also still worth watching, though it was made in 1961). Jenny hosts the news programmes that take us through to almost the last moments. Tea Leoni is the fresh face that stands out from the old-timers in the cast, and this is so right, given the role she has to play in the film, as a slightly confused initiate to the biggest news story ever, thrust into the limelight as the person telling it to viewers straight, as the dramatic story unfolds. Tea is utterly, almost breathtakingly, gorgeous in this film, but her slightly dreamy, lost manner endears her character yet more fully to the viewer. Jenny is without a partner, has divorced parents, has devoted herself to a career that has not quite gone anywhere (until now), and thus comes over as someone very much in need of love, and doubtless many members of the audience would be more than happy to oblige, falling for the character, hook, line and sinker - as I do each time I see the film! For this film does indeed repay watching, let's say every 5 or 6 years - possibly forever. To end as I began, I would venture to suggest that Elijah Wood has screen presence too, and he's in the film as well - if in a still quite junior version. So what's not to like here in this great, if perhaps under-appreciated piece of sci fi that is (like all good sci fi) far more than just sci fi...

While at the same time the remaining main characters on Earth are able to find reconciliation among various emotional differences with other people in order to find happiness.This is no coincidence. The title may not refer to the impact of the comet into the Earth but rather that we have deep impact amongst others in our lives. This ranges from all forms of relationship types to at times people that we haven't met. The film encourages the ideas of the importance of art and culture within our society, as well as the meaningfulness of the individual. Everyone is important and should never be reduced to a number in a lottery such as the one within the film.www.filmrhetoric.blogspot.com "},{"Title":"Lots of sentiment, too much God","Date":"17 May 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":" Generally, I really liked this movie.

I like some of the philosophical questions which are addressed about out relationships and sacrifice. The main drawback of the movie is that it absolutely drips with sentimentality and appeals to God and patriotism. The blinded astronaut talking to his newborn baby who is waving a stuffed rocket!!! The teenagers marrying to save the family and learning responsibility and sacrifice. This story was reasonably well told and most of the performances were decent.

Both have the same plots and are filled with stars, but Deep Impact wins in the non-visual portion. But Mimi Leder's directing is fantastic. The accuracy of the world ending is very high, probably the most accurate ever filmed. Of course there are some questions and doubts, but the movie is the way it is for dramatic purposes. That's just the way Hollywood is.As mentioned earlier, Deep Impact's non-sci-fi portion is much superior to Armageddon. The acting and story are great. In Deep Impact, a high school student (Wood) and astronomer learn that there is a comet heading towards Earth that will hit within a year. A journalist (Leoni) learns what's happening and what the government is doing about it. The struggle for survival by the citizens of Earth and the performances by Leoni, Wood, Sobieski, Duvall and Freeman are some of the best all year. The space and impact portions are dazzling to see, yet a bit sad to watch.

This movie has a clear predecessor in the 1950s When Worlds Collide, which has about the same plot, and also in its focus on the human stories of the disaster, owes much to the nuclear catastrophe film On the Beach. My verdict is that, due to its upgraded 1990s special effects, it is clearly superior to the former movie, but due to its really dumb script, it is very inferior to the latter. The plot revolves around an accidental discovery by a high-school astronomy club. Leo the high school whiz-kid (Elijah Wood) notices something out of the ordinary in his telescope and gives a photo to a mentor at the big telescope in Arizona. The mentor concludes that it is a 7-mile long comet headed straight to earth to extinguish all life. The President (Morgan Freeman) covers up the bad news for a year, but a reporter with MSNBC (Tia Leoni) stumbles onto the story and forces his hand into a press conference. The President reveals not only the ELE (Extinction Level Event), but also a plan to stop the comet with nukes on board a space-ship, and it is game-on.If this movie had chosen to be either a action movie like Armageddon or a drama, like On the Beach, it probably would have worked a lot better. The action-sci-fi part is good with cool action scenes and monumental end of the world special effects. It is the best part of the movie.The human drama stuff, however, falls flat. Tia Leoni's and Elijah Wood's characters both are a bit annoying and the drama seems artificial. Maximillian Schell gives it his best as her estranged dad trying to reconnect before the big boom, but something just doesn't seem quite right. A romance between Leo and Sarah, in which Leo marries her at a young age to make her eligible for a survival lottery, has plenty of potential, but the romance has no chemistry and again seems rather artificial. Morgan Freeman is awesome as the President (I think he could be President), but there is not much focus on his part of the drama either--he just stands around looking presidential.This is a big contrast to a movie like On The Beach, where, in response to an end of the world radiation cloud, Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner, Anthony Perkins and Fred Astaire give amazing performances that seem to take you right to what it would be like if you were faced with a situation like this. In contrast, Deep Impact seems shallow, with a lot of plots and none really given their justice.In some ways, Bruce Willis's Armageddon, which came out in the same year, is a bit more consistent--Willis does not make any attempt at profundity, the movie is just a lot of cool action. Deep Impact might have been better a bit shallower.

Everything about the movie are straight wins fantastic storyline revolving around a reporter, the sub plot characters were all believable and you start to care for them from the moment you see them. I looked up the director (Mimi Leder) and that sort of explains why the movie does not have an overdose of testosterone like the numerous Michael Bay Transformer movies.

I simply don't feel the same way. I found the script to be hackneyed and full of tired clichés. (BTW, if a couple teens got married because they knew the ELE was about to happen, don't you think that they would have resigned themselves to leaving their parents and staying with each other, regardless of the outcome? Apparently not.) When compared to Armaggedon, DI definitely comes off being more realistic in the sense that the characters aren't cartoonish, but they're sure not the kind of people I know and they don't bring anything to the story you can't get from a Zane Grey novel. Some are absurdly noble and others just do the irrational or unexpected.Now, if you think you might want to see some more interesting (if not totally realistic) characterizations of people facing the end of the world, consider On The Beach (1959) or even Last Night (1998).Ultimately, I find DI to be less noisy and bombastic than Armaggedon, but no more realistic.

Clearly, 1997 saw someone doing the rounds with Asteroid due to strike the Earth - mission sent into space to destroy it - mission succeeds - only major mayhem on Earth, not total destruction. Armageddon concentrated on the mission to destroy the asteroid and how heroic they were (by gum, that Bruce Willis, what a hero!). Deep Impact, on the other hand, concentrated on the stories of the people remaining on Earth to face the worst. In that respect, it became standard disaster movie soap material - who is going to survive, who isn't, who is going to sacrifice themselves so that someone else might survive, who has a damaged relationship which is going to be repaired just in time...I understand the principle - you need to identify with people so that the disastrous happenings carry some emotional weight. My main criticism with this movie is that there was a bit too much soapy stuff, and rather too little mayhem. When it came it was very well done, but there wasn't very much of it.Oh well, roll on the next disaster (or Roland Emmerich's 2012 as I like to call it).

That's not to say that there is not some good sci-fi in there, or that the special effects are weak (they are quite good actually) just that Deep Impact has more on its mind. It is the interaction of the characters that is front and center, and for the most part those relationships ring true.Tea Leoni plays the overwhelmed-by-events thing a bit too hard, but Morgan Freeman is quite convincing as the President, and Robert Duvall and the rest of the shuttle crew are also good. Leelee Sobiesky and Elijah Wood did well playing worried young lovers, forced by events to grow up a bit too fast.This movie was not the self-proclaimed blockbuster that Armageddon was, but it does not seem to have intended to be one. It's a slightly more thoughtful look at the same subject, and profits in the comparison. If you're looking for a technical treatise on meteor-collision strategies, you'll be left wanting by either movie, but Deep Impact does satisfy on the dramatic level. A good way to spend an evening.

Deep Impact came out about the same time as a Bruce Willis/Michael Bay vehicle about the same subject, and this is, by far, the better of the two.The discovery of the unwelcome rogue extraterrestial piece of space rock is done very well; with students and scientists happening upon the impending doom by accident; this is followed by intrigue and mystery involving an aspiring TV reporter (Tea Leoni) and involves many politicians, all the way up to the president himself (Morgan Freedman). I don't usually think Leoni is all that good, but her performance in this movie was dynamic and believable. Freedman is great, as always, and does the patriarchal chief executive role with all due sentiment and strength. Another strong actor, Robert Duvall provides a strong leadership role for the group of astronauts dispatched to demolish the incoming behemoth before it reaches its destination us.The film takes on too much of back stories of characters, and the stories being told about the people, unfortunately aren't all that interesting. The actors make the most of the script as written, but many of these back stories are just too sappy and contrived to identify with. The movie, it should be noted, does have its moments the scene with the astronauts communicating with people on the ground is very touching. Special effects are accomplished with precision, and accent the doomsday premise of the film very well. Throughout most of the movie, it endeavors to be faithful to known scientific facts about asteroids. However, the closing scene is just done so poorly that it's ridiculous. The scene with the teen astronomer Bederman and his young Helen Hunt-look-alike wife on a toy motor bike running away from the destruction is just woefully executed. Whoever directed this sequence should be launched into space and fed to the attacking meteors.All in all, a good story. It has its weakness in the human element aspects of its script, but it's still a good watch. "},{"Title":"Deeper, more dramatic 'Impact'.","Date":"29 March 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":" My Take One of the most convincing end-of-the-world movies in a long time. Since the dawn of the CGI era, Hollywood has spun box-office gold after box-office gold, enough to make more box-office... well, you get it! Since it was popularized in James Cameron's nonstop thrill machine sequel TERMINATOR 2 JUDGMENT DAY and Steven Spielberg's first-rate creature feature JURASSIC PARK, CGI has enabled Hollywood directors/special effects wizards to create images so realistic, it's nearly identical to the real thing. This followed many other big-budget so-called event pictures, one of which is the reworking of the long-considered forgotten sub-genre, the 1970's disaster genre.Back in the 70's, only the AIRPORT series (the first three actually), THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE and THE TOWERING INFERNO were the real box-office, or at least, commercial and critical successes, while notorious flops like AIRPORT '79 and WHEN TIME RAN OUT... would completely kill off the genre. But believe it or not, like it or not, the genre is back, and on a winning streak once more. While James Cameron's TITANIC became the most successful film of all time, thanks mainly for an involving love story that we all loved. Then here comes DEEP IMPACT, foretelling the biggest natural disaster extinction by a giant comet. This isn't a new formula, even for the genre. This has been around since 1979, in the film called METEOR, as Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer's other meteor movie Armageddon which came out just the same year, but wasn't out 'till summer.Of course no one really expected DEEP IMPACT to be any form of art, considering its roots. It may just be another 1970's disaster movie scenario, but, it is, this is one of the best 1970's disaster movie of the CGI era. While it ain't free from the disaster movie clichés like TITANIC was (elevating it from being another CGI 1970's disaster offering), DEEP IMPACT is more high-concept and better written. This one, unlike the rest, devotes itself mainly to the effects rather than the source, allowing us to better relate to the characters. The opening, of course, devotes to introduce characters and hint on the impending doom. The film opens with the introduction of one of the main characters, this is Leo Beiderman (Elijah Wood), the youngest character, who also one of the first top predict the ominous disaster while stargazing with his Astronomy Club. This is marred with, of course, a back story featuring his family as well as juvenile yet sweet and gentle relationship with the next door girl Sarah Hotchner (Leelee Sobieski).One year later, we are introduced with another character, an eager reporter named Jenny Lerner (Tea Leoni), currently having problems with her divorced parents (Maximillian Schell and Vanessa Redgrave), as well as getting caught into a discovery of an E.L.E, which she misinterprets as a presidential scandal. Turns out, its an Extinction Level Event. Hidden from the public for over a year, President Tom Beck (Morgan Freeman) has finally come up with a plan to save the earth. The largest space shuttle ever constructed called the Messiah, manned by veteran moon-walker Spurgeon Fish Tanner (Robert Duvall) and a crew of young yet experienced astronauts, will land on the comet, plant nuclear weapons in its base, and blow it out of space. Will they succeed? Of course, Hollywood won't deny us the big-budget, special effects laden destruction of earth, so no questions asked.Still, with its clichés, DEEP IMPACT had me hooked, not by the expectations of special effects (which doesn't actually occur during later on), but of the surprise, unexpected focus on character and drama. Director Mimi Leder wants us to care about these characters, which are nicely written by Ms. Leder's crew of writers (Bruce Joel Rubin & Michael Tolkin). Even the supporting characters were given sufficient focus, except, maybe, the expendable ones. The performances were better than the usual affair, considering that others in the genre let the special effects do most of the acting. Of course, the special effects were impressive, but its not frequent that they are overshadowed by the real actors and those behind the camera. DEEP IMPACT still ain't close to the likes of TITANIC, but its still a great disaster film, considering that the talents don't get wasted under the shadow of special effects, big crowds and large budget.

I didn't exactly follow it, I just wanted to see all the cool special effects. Then, just last week, I saw it again. To me, the movie was the real Armagedon. The film begins with a young astronomer noticing something out of place in the midnight sky. He sends the picture to an observatory, where the house astronomer makes a horrifying discovery...it's a comet on a collision course with Earth. In this film, the world governments have a year+ to come up with a plan to divert the comet. The plan is twofold, Land a large spacecraft on the comet, bury a couple of nukes 100m deep, blow the nukes and send the comet off course. If that fails, the government plans to move a couple hundred thousand people into NORAD (A nuke-proof fortress built into a mountain) and wait out the death, destruction, and mayhem. The film is focused on three people; a reporter, the young astronomer and his girlfriend, and the astronaut captain who leads the mission to save earth. Their paths never cross, yet their stories are woven together beautifully as they cope with a tidal wave of emotions that hit. This film is a bit sappy. Guys expect your girlfriend/wife to cry, you might even also. In the end, it's a story of sacrifice. True heroes, risking, giving up their lives for someone else.

Possibly now that has been rectified to some extent by NASA naming one of its space explorers Deep Impact. It must be remembered that the disaster situation visualized in this movie is not a figment of imagination - certainly not a Godzilla. Comets and asteroids have struck the earth before, and will certainly do so in the future, whether we like it or not. The only question is whether the human race will escape the devastation such an event will probably cause.The movie has an oblique reference to Eugene Shoemaker (of Shoemaker-Levy fame), the astronomer who was one of the first persons to draw attention to the likely threats, and who died in a car accident, as does the corresponding character in the movie. This movie is a disaster movie, but an unusual one in the sense that it's not a slam-bang, macho-Americans-taking-charge-and-saving-the-world type of situation. Instead, the focus is on the lives of ordinary people like us, who face imminent death. Very few of the affected people will escape death and destruction, and people desperately try to save themselves and their loved ones. The story of these people, told from the angle of their emotional turmoil is what makes this movie stand out.This movie will certainly raise the question in the minds of viewers as to what they would do if caught in a situation like this, particularly when you are faced with the choice of being able to save yourself while letting your loved ones and other people die.However, there is one spoiler in this otherwise excellent picture - the astronauts who sacrifice themselves to save the human race communicate with their families back in the Earth via video. The blinded astronaut touches the screen which shows his wife holding up his infant son before the camera. Since these Astronauts are very far away from the Earth, any such communication will experience a time lapse of several minutes, and thus this sequence is completely implausible, apart from being melodramatic, maudlin and overdone.But, all said and done, this is a story of human emotions in the face of adversity. The Indian newspaper The Statesman said at the end of its review -(possibly not the exact words) there is a sense of spiritual and artistic fulfilment. There certainly is, I fully agree. At the end of it all, I must say I found it spiritually uplifting, a movie of substance.

The characters are more important than the special effects and the tears aren't from the death of one major character, but for the loss of millions and the salvation of billions.My eyes were filled with tears for the last 45 minutes of this film as impending doom approaches and the narrative takes you through the pain of individual characters, and in the final apocalyptic moments, you truly cry for the people trying to outrun a tidal wave of destruction.  The tears that round off the film are of joy, for despite the loss of millions of lives, a viewer feels relief at the saving of a handful of the leading characters (as unlike most films more than just one character sacrifices their life) and at the salvation of the world.It's a film that allows the audience to touch and feel many characters lives, as each actor, most notably Robert Duval, Elijah Wood, Leelee Sobieski, Tea Leoni and Ron Eldard, create and develop deep and believable characters throughout the course of the film.

The special effects, particularly the waves that hit the beach and NYC are very memorable; just the same, there's something off in this movie that I can't describe. The makers scoffed at the un-realism of Armaggeddon, released at the same time, but at least they don't spend so much time jawing in that one. Or maybe it's the wrap up with those mountains near the Virginia Beaches (!!), on a par with Harold & Kumar's New Jersey cliffs. Or maybe it's the painfully protracted goodbye scene with the shuttle crew. Or maybe it's that they don't do anything for eight months while the comet gets closer and closer.

After viewing the movie several times on TV,I concluded that this film has lots of mistakes and plot holes.First,one of the most important plot holes happens right after the comet crashes into Earth. People are evacuating the cities,but the comet passes nearby them,without doing any harm to them.Now,if this was a real comet,then all the people should have died,because of the tail of the comet and the speed of it.Second,President Tom Beck announces that several Titan missiles are going to be launched to stop the comet,yet it is impossible to build as many missiles from within one year time.The movie takes place between the years 1998 and 1999.Then,the powerful wave that strikes New York City should have created more destruction as depicted,destroying all of the New York City area and beyond it. And the final plot hole that I discovered,is when at the end of the movie,we see President Tom Beck standing at a reconstructed White House,and in front of a clear sky.First,President Beck said that after the impact of the comets,the sky would prevail dark for 2 years because of the impact.So it s impossible either for the White House to be reconstructed in short time and to have a clear sky.The right ending for this film should have happened inside the ark,not outside.A nice movie,but nothing as near what could happen in the real life.

But it is still a year away before we have to worry about anything.Jenny Lerner (Tèa Leone) is an unknown reporter for MSNBC who is trying to make a name for herself by investigating a rumored sex scandal involving a former member of the President's cabinet (James Cromwell) and a woman named Ellie. But she finds out that Ellie is really ELE, an acronym for extinction level event.The President (Morgan Freeman) sends seven astronauts and a Russian cosmonaut on the space shuttle to attempt to destroy the comet before it destroys the earth. They must land on the rock's surface, drill, and insert two nuclear warheads into it. Oh, and they have seven hours to do this before the sun rises on the comet and heats the surface 350*.The cast includes great actors like Freeman, Robert Duvall, Maximilian Schell, and Vennessa Redgrave; future stars Leelee Sobieski, Laura Innes (ER), Richard Schiff (The West Wing), and Wood; and character actors Ron Ellard (ER), Blair Underwood (LA Law), and Bruce Weitz (Hill Street Blues).The three stories stayed independent while tied together by a common event, and each character had a story to tell. They were all very human, and the relationships--family, friends, and working--were very real.The special effects (such as the space scenes, the computer graphics, and the impact/tidal wave) were visible, but they did not detract from the movie. Unlike another asteroid movie, there was a sense of realism to the impending doom, as if someone actually researched the science behind the fiction.A few notes This was the first feature from Dreamworks SKG.

The plot is very good, the characters have depth, and throughout the movie you feel the director building up the atmosphere until the final veredict. As I've seen Mimi Leder's work the year before in the also excellent Peacemaker, I knew she would be a good choice for the job.

Surprising even myself, I actually liked it.Considering my known antipathy towards long, emotional scenes, ascathing criticism of Deep Impact could probably be expected, but - unfortunately, you might say - will not be forthcoming. Just to simplify matters, here we go; item by item.ACTING   On the whole, I was impressed by the acting. Freeman, while good, overacted a bit - pausing too often and in the wrong places, for instance - and did seem rather sanctimonious; nevertheless, an extremely good effort, and that only made those slight niggles show more. The other actors were also, on the whole, very good; Wood and Sobieski were relatively convincing, and even Denise Crosby's acting was surprisingly good.SPECIAL EFFECTS   The effects, while spectacular, served to advance the plot and not the other way round. The long shots of the comet seemed slightly wrong, but almost all the other effects were extremely well done.SCIENTIFIC ACCURACY   I was impressed with the accuracy; unfortunately, the main errors were large and obvious, though clearly required for the plot - I would say that the science was fairly solid, allowing for artistic licence. The details were impressively accurate, though - the very realistic depiction of the impact, and the way the water was pulled away from the shores; the jets on the MMU; even the burns on the astronaut's face as the terminator crossed their position.PLOT   Ah yes. There is a Hollywood law that states Any impending disaster will be primarily centred (geographically or in effect) on the USA. However, this notwithstanding, the plot was good. Well written, and not entirely unbelievable, its only real problems were a rather laboured infatuation with relatively pointless emotional scenes. To quote from Monty Python's Quest For The Holy Grail, in the words of everyone from Tim the Enchanter to God himself, Get On With It!So, on the whole, an enjoyable film. Some decent science, some sensible and believable scenes (such as the bus guard not being talked round), and impressive special effects, but unfortunately afflicted by overacting and excessive sentimentality, this is just a few notches away from being a magnificent film.8/10 "},{"Title":"Comparatively Good, But That's Not Saying Much","Date":"18 May 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":"  A few words about the technicalities of producing a the - end - is - neigh movie such as Deep Impact ... to begin with, from a commercial point of view, it is the type of plot that is going to sell box office tickets like hot buns ... large asteroid headed for collision with planet Earth -- I'm getting goosebumps already!  The problem then is finding a good ending -- all life wiped out would be too depressing for a Hollywood movie, danger closely averted, everyone safe, boy gets girl would be too easy, too clichéed and -- these days -- too unrealistic even for Hollywood.  So it needs to be something along the lines of a few of the good guys get killed (drama) but enough survive to allow for a happy ending (feel good), which is of course what DI went for.Overall DI does a good, commercial job of connecting points A (the premise) and B (the ending);  it's a bag of goodies, something for everyone  there is enough action, special effects and heroes - doing - what - they - gotta - do stuff, just the right amount so that the effect doesn't wear out, some decent acting and story telling (always a good thing), and enough romance and emotions to keep the nagging wife happy, who would rather have seen Michael Flatley or something.  Compared to the puerile Armageddon, DI is almost a masterpiece.Conclusion  DI is the type of movie that does what it says on box.  Though not by any means brilliant, it is a solid film that largely relies on story telling and a few good effects, whereas Armageddon is just an oversized MTV action video.

The cast is jam-packed with established talent, and the actors are not burdened with awkward lines from a bad script. This movie has a lot going for it.But it will never be all that it can be, because the flaws bring it into conflict with too many segments of the audience.If you're an old man who likes to get up at the crack of dawn on a Saturday and go see a movie at a drive-in that night, without a nap in between, like I did, you will fall asleep. But you will be amazed at how quickly this will put you to sleep. Until that comet hits, baby, this is one slow ride.If you appreciate the talent of ILM and love special effects, this film won't disappoint except that you have to wait almost until the end of the movie to see the payoff. What a payoff, though. The tsunami, the con-trail as the comet headed over the ocean, the Statue of Liberty broken into pieces, the floods, etc. etc.And if, in your everyday life when you're still worried about how things work, you have a drop of libertarian blood in your veins - which is to say, you believe the federal government has a limited jurisdiction in the things it is authorized to do - you may very well have a stroke watching this. I mean, Good Lord. Naming a rocket Messiah and pointing it at the juggernaut of a comet without telling anyone. No congressional oversight. Building caves and holding a lottery. I'd love to see the outcry if George W. Bush does one-hundredth of this stuff, not matter what the situation.None of this stuff matters worth beans if you're going to blow $2.99 at Blockbuster. But it's kind of important because all of the strengths are compromised in some way. It shines in the department of character development, special effects, and Morgan Freeman. Well, the characters are all flawed, deliberately, and to excess. When Maximilian Schell's time came, if he was on fire I wouldn't have handed him a bucket. The special effects take too long, and won't save you from boredom. It could be fairly asked, if special effects don't spare the audience boredom, what's the point? Morgan Freeman is awesome, but unless you're naive enough to believe the President can repeal the law of gravity, his executive actions will bother you so much you won't be able to enjoy him.And if you are that naive - hey, why can't he simply order the comet to stop? He's the President.What's left? Robert Duvall's character is interesting, but his self-sacrifice is predictable. You should be able to see it coming an hour in advance. After all that, there's not much left to this film. It's a good chick flick. And one can't help but think, with the nation in an impeachment crisis as it was released, the product might have been tweaked to help Clinton's image and affect the outcome of things in Washington.I'd say if you have a liberal democrat girlfriend and want to get some results out of her, head on over to her place with this movie and a bottle of cheap ripple.

Mass chaos and people protesting at why saving two birds and an antique over their lives, would happen. And for these reasons among others, she hit the 'what if' nail on the head with this film. The problem is, the realism is in the subtle touches and not the central storylines. Or the special effects which, i have to say, am i the only one who thinks CGI is the most fake looking form of effect going and doesn't understood the Hollywood obsession with it? People probably would start to take on different roles in their families, (but come on,'I'm going back for Sarah', 'Ok, kid, just let me give you my watch and be on your way now' - oh my god as if!)It just seems that it could have been a better film without lame attempts at sinking New York thrown in for good measure at the end. I like the fact that we're allowed to have a humanist approach to an action blockbuster, but the film comes across as unsure of itself. It doesn't want to be one or the other (and rightfully so - i'd like to think we've moved on) but, despite this, it's hardly a seamless synthesis either, really, is it.

Deep Impact is good because it takes a look at the possibility from the other end of the spectrum how would we truly act as citizens of the Earth if we thought it might be destroyed? It's always been interesting to me that I enjoyed both films fairly equally. Whenever I'm asked to compare them I have to tell people that they are two completely separate movies, rather than two movies about the same thing. And that's what I'll tell you. If you're looking for that roller-coaster ride of a movie, see Armageddon. If you want a true drama that shows how we as humans might react in a very serious situation, I highly recommend Deep Impact. I must add this note I agree completely with the previous reviewer who said that Morgan Freeman's performance as the President in this movie is perhaps the finest performance of anyone in that role, and more screen time for him would have made the film even better.

I don't think I would like the fate of the world to be in the hands of total idiots.The best effect, to my taste, was the giant tsunami (about 1 mile high) that destroyed New-York.  I have studied in astronomy and physics and it is what would happen if a comet hit earth; let me give an example if a comet (causes a bit more damage than an asteroïd because a comet is more compact and more dense) of 1 mile wide if it collided on earth would make a hole that could be as big as 80 miles wide and 5 miles deep, would create an earthquake over 10 on the richler scale and send about 2 billions tons of earth in orbit to prevent the sun to light and heat our planet.  If it fell in water it would'nt be stopped because of its size and would create a tsunami of about 1 mile high and would hit the bottom and crate another monster earthwuake.

There's always ARMAGEDDON.But DEEP IMPACT, besides having special effects that are every bit as spectacular as ARMAGEDDON, and far more believable, has something that ARMAGEDDON sorely lacks a human dimension.  This is a really thought-provoking what-if movie about the extreme emotional and social impact on the world when it is announced that a seven mile-wide comet is on a collision course with Earth.  Supposedly, one such uncomfortably close encounter with a space rock sixty five million years ago obliterated the dinosaurs.  This one will have the nightmarish effect of a nuclear holocaust (minus the radiational fallout), and it COULD wipe out the human race...unless a space expedition team, captained by Robert Duvall, can nudge the comet out of its collision course.Co-starring Morgan Freeman, Elijah Wood, Tea Leoni, Leelee Sobieski, and Maximillian Schell, DEEP IMPACT is effectively directed by Mimi Leder (THE PEACEMAKER); and though the Bruce Joel Rubin/Michael Tolkin script doesn't entirely avoid the melodramatic pratfalls of the 1970s disaster films, it does give the film a humanity that was woefully absent from ARMAGEDDON--not surprising, given the fact that this is from Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks SKG factory.James Horner, who scored TITANIC, AN AMERICAN TAIL and APOLLO 13, gives us another very effective score here, ensuring that the very deep impact of DEEP IMPACT lasts longer than the sound and fury of ARMAGEDDON.

This film tries to be a bit more realistic. Many of those who have posted complaints about the realism of this film are simply in need of a better science education. Certainly there are a few factual flaws but the basics are all technically accurate. What it really should bring home is the sorry truth of how little our current science could do in such a situation, because we really do not yet have the technical capabilities that are shown in this film. If such a thing were discovered by some astronomer next year, we would have _no_ real hope of surviving, because we would not have time to build anything. Nine women cannot produce a baby in one month, and so it is for aerospace. Hell, we can barely get the space shuttle to work right and we've been working on it for 20+ years, and it is a toy compared to what would be needed for this task.Everyone hated Tea Leoni?

For those like myself who like many types of movies, it was a refreshing change. Deep Impact has several good things going for it. The script was co-written by the talented Michael Tolkin (The Player) which gives it more depth than expected. Unlike almost all science fiction, the story is believable. The supporting cast which includes, Robert Duval, Morgan Freeman, Vanessa Redgrave and Maximilian Schell, is excellent. The special effects are effective and under the direction of Mimi Leder, Deep Impact moves smoothly from emotional scenes to outer space to action sequences.The core of Deep Impact is the characters including government officials and how they would deal with the coming doom of our planet. The hard, gut wrenching choices are what drives the film. My only problem with it is that the star, Tea Leoni, is just not good enough to carry such a big movie. Mostly she stares with her mouth open as great actors perform around her. With Ryder, Blanchette or Paltrow Deep Impact could have been great.Deep Impact breaks the mold of the standard disaster/action movie. Underneath the science and explosions are real people that you begin to care about and takes the time to show how they deal with a terrible event and how they over come it.

As the asteroid belt occupies a huge volume of space between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, any detour through the belt by a spaceship travelling to Mars is not going to be small.From there on, it was all downhill.Years later, I saw Deep Impact and, within the first two minutes, that sinking feeling was back.The opening scene was a High School star party somewhere in Virginia, with one of the participants commenting about seeing Alpha Centauri. That is a nice trick from Virginia, given that Alpha Centauri is more than thirty degrees below the southern horizon.I noted that American school kids at star parties, having adapted their eyes to the dark, use white-light torches to read their star maps, but the interesting part was one of them using a six-inch telescope to discover a large, fuzzy, naked-eye-visible comet that had been completely missed by astronomers the world over.The film makers had hired an ex-astronaut to supposedly ensure reasonable accuracy in the space scenes and astronaut jargon, but their budget obviously did not extend to hiring a competent astronomer.The next scene showed that your average major observatory in the USA has such powerful software in desktop PCs that only one observation of a new comet is enough to calculate the 100 percent certainty of a collision with Earth. It also showed that some major USA observatory staff have forgotten how to use the observatory telephone when their e-mail server goes down at a crucial moment.From there on...well, from there, Deep Impact could still have made the grade, but it degenerated into a gooey, cliché-ridden, end-of-civilisation-as-we-know-it, soap opera, mixed in with cliché-ridden astronaut heroism and a calm-under-fire President (Actually, Morgan Freeman and Robert Duval were the only two of the whole bunch that I liked).The scenes on the surface of the comet were clearly the product of someone's imagination, but then, who really knows what a comet's nucleus looks like at ground level? But, when, oh when, will movie makers get it into their heads that there are no sounds in the vacuum of space; neither roaring rockets, nor whooshing geysers on a sunlit comet. Stanley Kubrik got it right long ago in 2001 A Space Odessy, but since then, everyone has forgotten - or just don't care.The actual cometary impact into the North Atlantic and resulting tsunami were adequately represented and it was sobering to watch the wave overtopping the soaring towers and panic-stricken populace of Manhattan, before rolling relentlessly inland. In the mind's eye was the same wave radiating out from the impact zone and destroying every coastline bordering the Atlantic Ocean.It is one of nature's little ironies that, on a global scale, an equivalent impact into a land mass would do far less damage.Hollywood may have done the Spacewatch programme a favour with this film, and (cringe!) Armageddon, by heightening public awareness that there is still a lot of loose material left over from the solar system's formation and that, even 5 billion years later, Earth is not safe from Lucifer's Hammer.Deep Impact lived up to my very low expectations, but, still, it could have been worse &#150; that comet could have hit in the Pacific and got me!

It really grates on me when I constantly hear people say Oh, but Armageddon had better special effects. So what?Special effects/visual effects are adjuncts to a story. A movie is supposed to tell a story, not be a fireworks display, and Deep Impact does this very well. It tells a series of stories about people living with the knowledge that the destruction of most of the life on the planet is nearing, and the various ways they cope (or don't). The special effects exist only to drive the story, not vice versa, and as such fulfil their role nicely.Scientifically, whilst Deep Impact has some inconsistencies, they are relatively minor and I had no problem suspending my disbelief. An obvious effort was made to be reasonably accurate (with the low escape velocity of the comet providing an additional danger and the day side of the comet erupting with geysers of gases), and I appreciated this. Too many sci-fi movies today plunge headlong into stories that could be made MUCH more plausible if someone would just pick up a high-school physics text (Armageddon and Chain Reaction spring to mind).On the whole, Deep Impact was, like Contact, a quality science-fiction story it is about people, and their reactions to various situations and conflicts in an unusual setting, but above all, the CHARACTERS are the centres of the story.I give it *** out of *****.

Except for one (implausible) attempt at shattering a comet in space, nothing slightly stimulating occurs until...well, you figure it out. While action films aren't geared toward deep character developement, some would have been nice here. Deep Impact strives for character involvement but overloads us with so many plotlines and problems that we eventually give up caring.  No one's given enough screen time to be understood, and some of the conflicts (notably the one between Jenny and her father) are so boring and listless that it's a relief to know that the movie can only be two hours long or so. While the special effects are redeeming (you knew they would be, right?) nothing much else is, other than Morgan Freeman as a convincing President.What intrigued me most was the situation presented in the movie and never followed up on.  People on earth knew a year in advance that a possible Doomsday was approaching.  That begs the fascinating and overwhelming question What would we do with only one year left on our clocks?  I would really love to have seen how the world would deal with this.  As human nature would have it, I am sure many would spend their money on expensive cars and vacations, while others would indulge in alcohol, gambling and other assorted vices for comfort.  Perhaps even others would fulfill their wishes and get married before the inevitable arrived.  And surely there would be panic--lots of it--and this too was missing from the movie.  It was almost laughable, everyone diddling around until the last moment.I believe that would have made a great movie; the moral and social implications aren't textbook stuff but real life-and-death issues we someday might face.

Oceans rise.cities fall.hope survives?  Oh, please!  Well, it's not Armageddon, and it doesn't star anyone who looks remotely like Ben Affleck, but this is definitely the summer's thinking person's action flick.  I was quoted over the summer in US magazine as saying, If a man had directed 'Deep Impact,' which was directed by Mimi Leder, it would have been 'Die Hard' on a comet. Which, interestingly enough, is pretty much what Armageddon was.  Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with that kind of slam-bang fare; I certainly oohed and aahed over the destruction and the sheer spectacle of Armageddon (not to mention Ben in his T-shirt).  What you'll never see in a Michael Bay movie, and what puts Deep Impact on the map for me, are performances with the subtlety of Robert Duvall's and Billy Bob Thornton's; brutal, heart-wrenching scenes like the final moment with Tea Leoni and her father on the beach; and rich character development that leaves you unable to ooh and aah over the destruction, because your connection with the characters leaves you horrified at the loss.  Deep Impact is one of a rare breed.

Weighing over half a trillion tons, this meteor will attribute to the extinction of life on Earth as we know it...unless the comet can be destroyed before it hurls toward its destination.As news conferences spread word on the inevitable extrication of mankind, panic reigns, fear takes over, and the world is gripped in a state of frenzy... President Tom Beck (Morgan Freeman, again in an assured, pervasive performance) admonishes to the people that chaos and disorder cannot be tolerated and that cooperation among everyone is requisite for survival if the human race is to continue...Meanwhile, ambitious TV news reporter Jenny Lerner (Tea Leoni) has stumbled upon a U.S. government collaboration cover up pertaining to the celestial message given by the so-called Doomsday Chronicles heading towards all of the world. She also learns that there is more than meets the eye or what the ear is allowed to hear when the government takes frantic measures to stop this meteor before it clashes alongside with Planet Earth, leading to the perishing of all forms of life...Spurgeon Tanner (Robert Duvall) may very well be mankind's last hope into thwarting the comet. With a ragtag team of experienced experts on all multifarious technical and scientific fields, Tanner and five other man embark on the Messiah mission. Their goal to nuke the juggernaut of a meteor by carefully positioning and installing sensitive nuclear warheads into the core of the meteor... By August 16, Tanner and his crew must complete their mission...for failure is truly not an option...If all else fails, a national lottery has been implemented which will allow approximately 1 million Americans to have their lives spared just to ensure the perpetuation of the human race...DEEP IMPACT contained all the ingredients needed to concoct a solid motion picture including A great premise, moody nail-biting suspense, substantive characterization, handsome production values, unfolding drama, and discreet use of big-budget Hollywood FX.DEEP IMPACT also offers a sprinkling of *emotional* moments to permit people to use their tissues and cry until their eyes are dry! However, with all the sincere strengths DEEP IMPACT has, this movie's fallibility cannot be overlooked.  Too bad for one, the product of DEEP IMPACT never reached  its full realization and potential. A mundane pace distracts from some very impressive special effects. Although the motion picture is satisfactory, yet, the film moves in a non-engaging and lackadaisical pace.Visually enchanting indeed, but the potency does not exist as profoundly as you may expect. The over-sentimentality is forced onto the audience, and an excess of emotional intensity can sometimes serve as an impediment to an otherwise well thought out script with confident character development. DEEP IMPACT is very humane with great perspectives ranging from a teen's (Elijah Wood) last moments with the girl he loves, to Lerner's brief reunion with her estranged father before disaster strikes!DEEP IMPACT is a good, enjoyable film saved by fine performances. Unfortunately, rather than allowing the audience to acclimate to the feelings and emotions of the characters on screen, the direction and structure of this movie is sometimes coerced to make the viewers try to care about these people whether the audiences are compelled to or not. Basically, in DEEP IMPACT,  the film makers strive to make the audience believe in the characters and their dilemmas they are experiencing instead of letting the audiences discern just for themselves when it is appropriate to think deeply, and weep...Second, DEEP IMPACT could really benefit from more (and a better variety of) special effects. Not nearly enough screen time was given to the eye-popping special FX, and many people will feel crestfallen by the end when the result of this film did not attain their high expectations.  DEEP IMPACT is a worthwhile film and a rather highly recommended motion picture to be seen. It's a big bang, all out special FX extravaganza by the climactic denouncement! The special effects are above par, the suspense keeps you on your toes, and tidal waves will develop...devouring cities by the whole... Also, the predictability in  DEEP  IMPACT  is  constant,  with  the connoisseurs always one step ahead of the characters on screen...In all sincerity, DEEP IMPACT is a modest hit. The characterizations are excellent, the FX are well constructed, and the plot and pace, though they move too turgidly, gives the viewer a more sympathetic perception on how martial law takes its toll on everyone from the government to the citizens.Think of DEEP IMPACT as an otherwise, routine first class film. The film is worth viewing and though a better pace is something left to be desired for, DEEP IMPACT is proficient enough as a firm, substantial thriller with compassionate characters and capable direction. This film is also commending for touching upon themes such as a forthcoming apocalypse, and the aftermath of how people must endure through the worst of times. As the characters remind us through their perseverance, the ordeal can be excruciating, but it will all eventually end...  The movie, DEEP IMPACT is worth your time. Still, this film is an indubitable misfire...for this movie is just missing something...RATING **1/2 out of ****.

This film was very appropriately said to be a poor man's On the Beach. In a sense that is accurate because while it has some decent to good characterizations, the nihilism and acting of On the Beach put it on a different level. This film has some nice performances and a very real and probable approach(at least in North America) of dealing with an impending disaster of this nature. Duvall is excellent(the portrayal of the NASA team, in particular the Russian, is real and without idiotic stereotyping, unlike Armageddon). Freeman is strong, and Tea Leoni is quite decent. It is wonderful to catch Maxmillian Schell who is basically a walk-on, but is nonetheless good. This film leaves one with questions rather than answers. Of note the cave creation or lottery the allude is occurring in other countries is problematic considering geography, landscape, and social demographics.

This film has several flaws, most of which have been noted in prior reviews.

On the other hand, this film (like Contact) takes a thoughtful -- and thought-provoking -- look at the sociological impact of an extra-human event.If you LOVED Armageddon, watch Deep Impact; the general plot and special effects are similar, but the movie goes well beyond it in terms of philosophical implications.

Well, my family and I thought it was okay.  We weren't bored, we weren't moved...but we did talk about it afterwards.The biggest problem is that it tries to be too many things  a disaster flick, a realistic response to crisis, a people film, a science film, a special-effects film, even a bit of a comedy (at least in spots).  It does well with none of these.  And in the end, you don't really care that much about the people who end up dead...or the ones that don't.My 11-year-old raised several questions after it finished, though, which we went on to discuss.  What would happen if a meteor or asteroid this big WAS coming towards the earth?  Wouldn't a nuclear blast deflect it?  It wouldn't take much deflection if you hit it from far enough away, would it?  If a big meteor or asteroid hit the ocean, would it make a wave that big?  What about earthquakes?  If it did make a wave that big, what would happen down here in New Zealand, a long way from the impact portrayed in the film, but where most of the population lives along the coast?  And, wouldn't there be a problem with genetic diversity if you took your ark animals 2-by-2 as they implied in the film?And then we went on to talk about the making of the film itself.  We all agreed that there were some scenes missing, like the finding of the computer disk near the beginning, and perhaps one before the first attempt to approach the meteor to build up the anticipation...and we talked about how those scenes were probably written and maybe shot, but somehow ended up on the cutting room floor...and for what reasons.  We also talked about the computer graphics manipulation that allows for disaster film special effects like we saw here.My husband and I give this film a 6--okay for a stay-at-home Friday night video but nothing remarkable.  My daughter gave it an 8.  I reckon the discussion afterwards was worth the video rental cost, though, and think this is a fine film for science-oriented families who talk about what they watch...there's plenty of fuel for thought.

There are story lines in this film that don't need to be there. Basically, Tea Leoni's whole character could go and the premise of the film would still be intact.The film is supposed to be about an asteroid overtaking the earth and killing millions of people.  How do we choose who gets to live?  How to people deal with that?  The film does explore these issues but not in enough detail.  Too much time is spent on Tea Leoni's character.  The film would have been better if it focused more on what the goverment of the world was trying to do to stop the asteroid and the crew that tried to stop it and failed. I don't have anything against Tea Leoni.  She's a fine actress who played her role well in this film.  However, her role should have been a lot smaller.  Mimi Leder turned the film into a chick-flick instead of a disaster movie.  In the end, it made the film more of a disaster than the one that took place in the film.

The movie was unjustly overshadowed by Armageddon, although both presented stellar casts and superb video effects. Deep Impact is by no means worse or weaker, and sometimes even better than that one in means of delivery or efficiency. 2. The cast is excellent - Tea Leony, Elihah Wood, Morgan Freeman, Leelee Sobesky, Vanessa Redgrave and my personal favorite Robert Duvall are among the many greats filmed here. And yes, there is a great Russian actor Aleksandr Baluev as a Russian space ace, and he does speak good enough English and very clear unaccented Russian. 3. The plot is nothing new, it is a disaster movie, and still, it looks nice, as it dwells more on human feelings, personal tragedies and sorrow than on the disaster itself. 4. Special effects are good, very good for 1998, and they are utterly convincing, as well as decent and thrilling. 5. The theme of personal sacrifice is very strong here, and it works well. 6. Well, why 7 out f 10? There are weaker, hammy, cheesy, overly sentimental moments in here, unnecessary teary scenes and prolonged silent scenes.

The music for Deep Impact is almost another star of the film.However, music is just one of the things this film has going for it. It has believable characters that are not totally overwhelmed by the epic nature of the story or scale of the production.The film begins as scientists discover a comet on a collision course with Earth. A TV reporter, Jenny Lerner (Téa Leoni), inadvertently discovers that the US government has known about it for some time and has put in place a plan to save people who will be useful for the survival of mankind. She also follows the space shuttle mission led by Captain 'Fish' Tanner (Robert Duvall) to deflect the comet with nuclear warheads.The final scenes are powerful ones with plenty of lump in the throat moments as people on earth either flee the impact of the comet or meet their end with stoicism.When the film was made, it probably seemed novel for Morgan Freeman, an African American to play President Tom Beck, but now that Barrack Obama is well into his second term it actually seems quite prescient. Although Freeman was a little older, with his great voice, sense of authority and even the dignified greying at the temples, it has proved to be an inspired piece of casting.Téa Leoni is also good in this. Overly strident reporters in movies can be grating, but she brings a human dimension and vulnerability to the role. The fact that she is a reporter also allows her to give information without it coming across as laborious exposition.The big theme in the movie is heroic sacrifice. The film has an uplifting spirit and doesn't dwell on panic stricken humanity or breakdowns in society. The film shows humans at their best and willing to help others &#x96; after all, humans are about the only species that will sacrifice themselves for each other. The film doesn't overdo the special effects. Where they are used they are awe inspiring especially when a piece of the comet hits earth. They are also used in imaginative ways such as when the comet passes over the stranded traffic and we see it reflected in the windows of the vehicles.Deep Impact is virtually a remake of George Pal's When Worlds Collide but is superior in every way to that film and not just in the improved special effects. As far as other end of the world movies are concerned, it gives Spielberg's War of the Worlds a run for its money, and has more substance than films such as Meteor, The Day after Tomorrow and Armageddon.

Surprising even myself, I actually liked it.Considering my known antipathy towards long, emotional scenes, ascathing criticism of Deep Impact could probably be expected, but - unfortunately, you might say - will not be forthcoming. Just to simplify matters, here we go; item by item.ACTING On the whole, I was impressed by the acting. Freeman, while good, overacted a bit - pausing too often and in the wrong places, for instance - and did seem rather sanctimonious; nevertheless, an extremely good effort, and that only made those slight niggles show more. The other actors were also, on the whole, very good; Wood and Sobieski were relatively convincing, and even Denise Crosby's acting was surprisingly good.SPECIAL EFFECTS The effects, while spectacular, served to advance the plot and not the other way round. The long shots of the comet seemed slightly wrong, but almost all the other effects were extremely well done.SCIENTIFIC ACCURACY I was impressed with the accuracy; unfortunately, the main errors were large and obvious, though clearly required for the plot - I would say that the science was fairly solid, allowing for artistic licence. The details were impressively accurate, though - the very realistic depiction of the impact, and the way the water was pulled away from the shores; the jets on the MMU; even the burns on the astronaut's face as the terminator crossed their position.PLOT Ah yes. There is a Hollywood law that states Any impending disaster will be primarily centred (geographically or in effect) on the USA. However, this notwithstanding, the plot was good. Well written, and not entirely unbelievable, its only real problems were a rather laboured infatuation with relatively pointless emotional scenes. To quote from Monty Python's Quest For The Holy Grail, in the words of everyone from Tim the Enchanter to God himself, Get On With It!So, on the whole, an enjoyable film. Some decent science, some sensible and believable scenes (such as the bus guard not being talked round), and impressive special effects, but unfortunately afflicted by overacting and excessive sentimentality, this is just a few notches away from being a magnificent film.8/10 "},{"Title":"'Realistic' alternative to Armageddon?

Having about a year and a half's notice of this, the U.S. and Russian governments send a spacecraft, the Messiah, to destroy the comet by drilling nuclear warheads into its core and then detonating. The movie focuses on three primary story lines 1. The young reporter Jenny Lerner (Tea Leoni) and her struggles with her career and her parents; 2. The high-school couple of Leo Biederman (who discovered the comet; Elijah Wood) and Sarah (Leelee Sobieski); 3. The crew of the Messiah.All three story lines are done in such a way that the viewer easily sympathizes with the very believable characters. The best done of the three is the spaceship's crew, although the most time is spent with Jenny. They all suffer from the film's only notable problem The story lines seem somewhat rushed. Considering its broad scope, Deep Impact clearly would benefit from an extra 30 minutes to develop, especially with the underdone angle with Leo and Sarah, but the directors evidently decided two hours was all they could use.Deep Impact, as I mentioned, lacks an A-list star, but it does feature superb performances from two of the best supporting actors of our generation Robert Duvall (Spurgeon Tanner, captain of the spaceship) and Morgan Freeman (Tom Beck, the U.S. President).

Tea Leoni's was by far the most interesting, as an up and coming reporter from a troubled family, who becomes the face of the crisis. What I didn't like was the storyline in space, where the would be heroes try to stop the asteroid. It just seemed unnecessary and like it dragged on. If the legendary Robert Duvall wasn't one of the astronauts, I'm pretty sure most of those scenes would have been cut.

But it did a good job of blending personal stories with official business. Morgan Freeman definitely had a Presidential presence. It was like his usual narratives, trying to soothe in the face of calamity.The special effects were quite decent and the action didn't seem contrived (like in Armageddon). There were some plot holes involving what typical reactions might be, like the sheeple who stuck with their cars, and the apparent lack of resistance to the President's master plan.One thing I thought of throughout was why can't people take global warming as seriously as the threat of an asteroid? Is it just because the former has a slower time-frame for worst-case impacts? The advice is given by scientists in either case. We are faced with a true potential calamity, with many of the same effects, like sea-intrusion on land. But average people are largely apathetic, even as the evidence grows.Climatologists are incompetent/conspirators just because they tell us burning fossil fuels has consequences? Come, on, people!

They have also been building some big tunnels which will hold a million people safely underground until the dust has cleared in case Plan A fails. The story though is stumbled upon by an intrepid reporter (Tea Leoni) from MSNBC big product placement here).In the tradition of the Irwin Allen disaster flick's of the 1970's (Towering Inferno, The Poseidon Adventure) we have a big cast and all sorts of story lies to build up a really big human aspect to the impending tragedy, and just in case that wasn't enough we get more than a few children in peril sequences. We have a student astronomer (Elijah Wood) who co-discovers the comet and young love in the form of Leelee Sobieski. We have the aforementioned reporter's parents (Maximillian Schell and Vanessa Redgrave) who have divorced because the father fell in love with a much younger woman. We have the heroic young astronauts and the older veteran astronaut (Robert Duvall) who put aside their differences and go forth bravely to try and stop the comet. But in all that we don't have anything that really stands out, lots of decent performances and a fairly compelling story if you ignore some of the plot holes, but it ends up being fairly routine. Not a bad movie and probably worth seeing if you really loved those Irwin Allen disaster pictures.Of the two comet pictures from 1998 (the other being Armageddon) this was the better film, it seems an odd thing to say but this by far the more credible and realistic story.

Both approaches have different appeal, but Deep Impact probably came out second best because it is less commercial than the afore mentioned film, not because it is worse.Deep impact is a fine movie in its own right, and it is appreciated as such by its real audience, it certainly carries plenty of emotional impact, a solid story and some excellent visuals; it also has plenty of fine talent in the cast to help the story entertain well, but i say again if its action your after then this isn't the right film for you.

Suspend disbelief for a bit and go along for the ride. It was a bit of a twist to actually show a fragment of the comet hit the Earh's surface, and the resulting devastation. The other mega-disaster film out that year, Armageddon, avoided this unpleasant outcome. So here is a bit of realism. The idea of a nuclear explosion fragmenting the comet nucleus into two pieces rather than pulverizing it is also a nod to scientific accuracy, as some theories about comet composition predict this effect. But, two films out in the same year with a similar premise had me on comet-asteroid overload.The cast is fairly strong. Morgan Freeman and Robert Duvall add their measure of gravitas to an otherwise unknown cast. Tea Leoni is not very good in this film, delivering her lines with a somewhat wooden and dry cadence. Also, the estranged child syndrome is in full force with Tea trying to reconcile her feelings for her remarried father (Schnell) and her still-living mother (Redgrave). I'll admit to having a bit of a crush on Mary McCormick, so I liked her in the role of a crew member of the doomed space mission. Still, I had the feeling hers was a bit of a token appearance, the addition of a female crew member in a nod to diversity and political correctness.The notion of the new-age Ark preserving a select few in the deep caves of mid-America reminded me of the scheme Dr. Stangelove hatched at the end of the movie of the same name. Here the world-ending event is natural rather than man-made, but the idea is the same. It is an arresting and sobering thought. On the one hand, we want humanity to survive, but what is to become of those left behind? How to they deal with their fate? An interesting dilemma that might make a decent movie in itself.Anyway, Deep Impact is a good film. Not great, mind you, but good enough for a viewing by those curious about such a storyline.

As a comparison, I have just seen the film  THe Day AFter Tomorrow and have already forgotten the special effects as there were so many of them.The secret of special effects is to have just a few, but placed at strategic moments in the film so as to remain indelebile in the spectators mind.Above and beyond the special effects in Deep Impace, is the cute, almost pathetic figure of Tea Leoni and the MOST EMOTIONAL moment of all is when she is huddled to her father ( after so much misunderstanding ) on that beach in the face of that impressive and impending tidal wave .........aaaaaaargh, every time, my eyes melt when I see it !!!!!!!!!!!The various interplay of emotions contributes greately to the film and the impending disaster is just a backdrop to the development in the relationships between the protagonists.

Aside from that concept however, the two could not have been more unalike. While Armageddon got by on its big-time stars, rampant sense of humor, and the best special effects $140 million could buy, Deep Impact managed to be much more substantial with an ensemble cast of Hollywood midlisters, life-like earthbound drama, just roughly one half the budget of its summer competitor. What is impressive and interesting about Deep Impact is the way it manages to present a reasonably realistic depiction of people dealing with a situation such as a possible apocalypse. The ensemble cast from all walks of American life is reminiscent of other worldwide disaster pics such as Independence Day and The Day After. Although the film is not exactly free of technical flaws, (such as my personal favorite) the suggestion that the largest spaceship ever built could be completed, in secret, over a period of just eight months. As well as casting mistakes, such as Tea Leoni, who is given a major role, but in the presence of such real Hollywood pros as Robert Duvall and Morgan Freeman comes across as a lightweight. Morgan Freeman, by the way, with his wonderfully dignified performance as the President, is not used nearly enough. Even in its limited capacity though, his role was one of the most memorable Presidential performances of recent years. Despite a number of minor problems, overall Deep Impact is the rare big-budget Hollywood movie that manages to be an entertaining summer popcorn flick, but at the same time finds a way to be semi-realistic and avoid completely insulting the audience's intelligence. The dramatic element of the film was effectively played out, especially where the astronaut crew is concerned, all in all making it a powerful sci-fi drama. Unlike some other films of that summer, this one didn't constantly try and make you laugh your ass off with the threat of total destruction looming. To sum it up, Armageddon may have been a bigger hit in the summer of '98, but it was simply getting by almost solely on Bruckheimer style. Unfortunately for the makers of that film, it is substance that endures, and that is why people will still be watching substantive films like Deep Impact, long after hokey fare such as Armageddon has been forgotten.

I couldn't believe people would try to evacuate by car on a highway that skirts the Atlantic Ocean; wouldn't they go west? Finally, there would have been room for many people in other caverns such as Carlsbad, and provisions (literally and figuratively) could have been made for those remaining above-ground.

While the acting itself is not horrendous, there is not enough of it to convey the type of emotion that the producers appear to have wanted to evoke.One of the more ignominious mistakes in this movie would undoubtedly have to be in the casting of Tea Leoni for the main role.

Yet as it stands, five minutes' worth of screen time for each of the minor  characters fails to evoke any kind of empathy.

Overall, a great movie that is one of the best in the sci-fi genre.

Just ridiculous. 2) Tea Leoni is a lovely looking girl but doesn't have the acting skills or gravitas to carry the role with any conviction. 3) Robert Duvall appears to be on autopilot. 4) Towards the end when things are utterly desperate we have the crew on the spaceship giving us tearful farewells, on camera, with their families. Let's see the bigger picture please; we don't care enough about the crew to want to watch these farewells! 5) The spaceship gets bombarded with massive chunks of comet and they practically bounce off it. At those speeds the damage from any one of those impacts would be terminal. What's good.... 1) Morgan Freeman is great, as always. Maximillian Schell even better. 2) The whole premise is thrilling and some of the images quite beautiful.What this film desperately needed was a decent screenplay.

Now that may seem like a statement of the obvious, yet directors consistently forget. 'Deep Impact' had the potential to be an 'intelligent' interpretation of a cometary impact upon Earth. Unlike the tongue-in-cheek space-hokum that starred Bruce Willis, it could have been the real McCoy. All the right elements were there. The science, the terminology, and the blockbuster special-effects. There was a sly, almost sinister build-up, with 'men in black' kidnapping a troublesome nosey-parker (female) journalist, and confusion over what 'ELE' actually meant. It had shades of 'Pelican Brief', and handled more vigorously could really have emphasised the conspiracy of silence. As the plot moved forward and the truth became clear, tension built extremely well. There was some fine acting at times, with Robert Duvall giving one of his best and most understated performances ever. But the directors just couldn't do the do. They had to turn it into a schmaltz-fest. They had to cast a kid as the hero. There had to be innumerable complex and fractured relationships with endless tearful soul-searching and chest-bearing. On and on it went. By the time the first piece of debris arrived it was almost incidental to the 90 minutes of soap-opera that preceded it. Every time there was an opportunity to ratchet-up tension, the directors copped-out and threw us back into the deep-end of maudlin schmaltz. Even the special-effects were interrupted so that we could witness a last goodbye, a final tear. And then there was the unexplained technical incongruity. Why would they risk the safety of the spacecraft by approaching the comet through its tail? Just one piece of ejecta striking the vessel would have ended the mission there and then. Why did the demolition crew walk about half a mile from the vessel in order to place the bomb? Why not do it under the ship and save themselves a lengthy walk, and also have the shadow of the ship over the top of them to protect them from the rising sun if they got delayed? Why bother returning to Earth when it's gonna be destroyed anyway? The OBVIOUS thing was a suicide attack on the comet. It was a no-brainer.Every time Hollwood makes a disaster epic, it's the same old story. The thing is served up as a basically decent meal, only to be drowned in emotional gravy. It happened at 'Jurassic Park'; it happened in 'The Day After Tomorrow'. It happened in the lamentable British 'Flood'.It seems to me that what has occurred in modern cinema is a blurring of what constitutes an 'adult' and a 'juvenile' movie. In order to get as many bums on seats and therefore as many bucks in the bank; the movie is released with the most child-friendly certification possible (this has a '12' rating). That way families can go and watch it, instead of just adults (who might otherwise not even bother turning-out as it will be available for rental within a few weeks). As a result, the 'adult' theme is dumbed-down in order that it can appeal to kids - hence the child-hero. But what these mogul-dummies don't seem to realise is that that's exactly why adults WON'T bother going to the cinema by themselves any more. Who wants to watch a 2-hour juvenile movie to see 5-minutes of adult special-effects?I got this movie as a 'special edition' from the local supermarket bran-tub. It was £3, and that was quite enough. I've watched it once. If it had been an adult movie I'd have awarded it 8-stars and watched it several times by now. 'When Worlds Collide', is a much more intelligent piece of theatre, despite dating from 1951. The director had the brains to keep the story moving, and not get bogged-down in endless personal dramas; there was enough and that was all. It's much more watchable despite the primitive special effects.Here's the blurb Oceans Rise, Cities Fall, Hope Survives. Yeah - and clichés never end.

It came out the same time as Armageddon, and at that time Armageddon seemed like a more entertaining film. However, Deep Impact withstands the test of time. I definitely did not appreciate Deep Impact as much when it came out as I did later.Deep Impact is a thinking person's film. I am tempted to say it's a thinkpiece but that seems so pretentious.The film sincerely explores the possibility that humanity might be wiped out by an Extinction Level Event (ELE) -- a comet named after a young man played by Elijah Wood who spots it at an astronomy club event.The pacing of the film is excellent. Upon announcement, there is a one-year timeframe before the comet is predicted to hit Earth, which is much more realistic than the couple-week asteroid doomsday deadline of Armageddon. The science in Deep Impact is much saner than Armageddon which is utterly ridiculous in its science fiction.The best parts of the film are the explorations of how the comet affects the people on Earth. With excellent music, the film goes deep into many peoples lives and shows us how such an event would affect anyone.I think the film spends a little too much time on the Messiah space mission. It was well done, that's for sure. But Deep Impact took a completely different route than Armageddon, and I think they should have stayed on Earth even more. That's what the film does best.Excellent film, way underrated.

She soon learns that it is something very different and very big. Then, the movie follows various story lines that have been building through the first part of the movie as the reality of a planet-wide disaster looks very close.There is personal sacrifice, sadness, disaster, interesting story lines and more. Though there is a large cast, the different story lines work well to relay how the disaster is unfolding from several and important angles.

The plot, for about the first 45 minutes makes some sense and then everything goes balmy. Part of this has to do with very poor directing from someone (Mimi Leder) who should stick with TV drama and soaps. It's her métier. The whole movie just becomes maudlin as soon as everyone finds out that it's DOOM, DOOM I tell you. These people don't try to live at all. They just commit suicide or sit in the tidal wave's way waiting to be engulfed. Is that reality? If you thought there was going to be a comet hit and that it would probably submerge a good part of the earth in water... wouldn't you head for the high ground, early? Or, if you thought it was going to blot out sunlight and you weren't chosen as part of the 1M cave dwellers, might you not band together with others to find a way to last 2 years? OK, all that aside. After our young hero is told his bride's family can't go and she won't go, wouldn't you get them all together and head for the hills? Why wait until you get to Missouri, which has to be at least 2 days from the East Coast by bus, to go back. And somehow, you hitch back in time to rescue her (how many days would that take... cars going toward the disaster... and ride off on a bike, doing maybe 30 MPH and yet still beat a wall of water going 1100 MPH? None of the numbers work out, nor do the emotions. It's all a lot of ham acting and people acting like sheep, instead of human beings. The special effects weren't bad. The acting was OK, when they weren't crying. Really, a very poor movie. PS. We won't even talk about back up systems. Scientists, good ones, never proceed in any project without a back up system. If they could build this rocket ship in less than a year, they could have built two or three or four of them.

I'm sure the makers of Deep Impact feel their version is the superior one due to its supposed realism and its wider focus of the planetary social ramifications of such an event.  Indeed, it is pretty interesting to think about what governments and people would do down here on Earth in this situation.  And Deep Impact is slightly superior in this respect, as there are a wide range of Earth-bound characters and plotlines that reflect the sense of doom this scenario presents.  This was not really explored much in Armageddon, as they chose to concentrate primarily on the mission to stop the comet.Most of the actors do a fine job here, and its always great to see Morgan Freeman and James Cromwell work.  Sure, some of the moments are a little cliche, and despite having the always reliable Robert Duvall, there's a good amount of cheesiness in the space sequences.  (Not near as much as in Armageddon though, one of the corniest movies of all time).  It seems Tea Leoni is a source of some criticism, and while I'm not her biggest fan, I thought she was more than adequate.  Elijah Wood and Leelee Sobieski weren't given enough to do, given their talents, but both turned in good performances.The special effects in both movies are nicely done, if not realistic.  But I would've liked to have seen both films explore the science behind this phenomenon more in depth.  I suppose they felt it would be too boring for the masses who want to see a bang-em-up disaster movie, but I think they underestimate the interest the public would have in learning more about how and why this can happen.  In Deep Impact, the presidential press conference was a perfect oppurtunity to do this, maybe bring in a scientist to get more technical and put things in perspective, but they basically just skimmed over it.I really wanted to love this movie, as I was a little disappointed with Armageddon and find the subject of both films fascinating and scary.  But unfortunately, Deep Impact, while overall an entertaining and solid disaster movie, also falls short of the grand masterpiece this idea deserves.  In other words, the ultimate end of the world asteroid movie still just hasn't been made yet in my humble opinion.  Eventually, someone will come along and think outside the box and really delve into a realistic exploration of Earth Crossing Objects and the hazard they represent.  And how amazing it is that in a matter of hours, the entire human race and every living thing on Earth could be wiped away without a trace.

HOWEVER, these interesting prospects never even surface, except for those few final F/X moments, which you already saw in the trailers and fanzine promos, so they end up being not that big of a deal.You would think that if this impending global catastrophie were to really occur, there would be much panic and an outright state of alarm.  There would be riots, grim demonstrations, suicides, outrage, wild armegeddon celebrations before the final hour hits, and other such pandemonion.  How would YOU actually be feeling and thinking if you knew for a searing fact that such a nightmarish tragedy was soon to hit?  What would you do?None of the cardboard characters reacted in any true believable manner or non manner.  Everybody just accepts it in a very noble, resigned way. Would you?  Some would obviously come to grips with it with that similar attitude, but we are here to see real human drama and terrifying action and not just a lot of wimpering 'I love yous', which is palmed off as real human feelings.  Good intentions do not always make for powerful, effective filmmaking.The dialogue is just plain insultingly stupid, and, at times, I thought I was channel flipping between Days of Our Lives and one of those preachy, tepid afterschool specials.  There was absolutely no suspense or even the remotist atmosphere of terror.  I never believed that the end of the world could be so humdrum and BORING!!!  Maybe that asteroid is actually a cleverly disguised Godsend.That tired old generation gap scenario between Duval and his younger class of gung ho recruits made me want to throw something at the screen.  All in the Family had more dramatic tension than all that meaningful manure. Of course you know that later, when those old chips are down, everyone will all hug and kiss and be one, big happy family.  Next time I will bring my own specialized vomit bag.Also, how do you land on a comet, or should I not dare ask such questions? Did it ever occur to the writers (and that includes the literary team behind Armegeddon) that if you blow up a giant asteroid, that all the shattered pieces would still proceed on course and could actually do even worse damage?  Has anyone in Hollywood ever read a basic science book or took Meteors 101?Someone please tell Tea Leoni to stick with light weight romantic comedies and not try to be the serious actress.  I have seen fire hydrants with more substance and dramatic depth.  Anne Heche would have been an ideal choice cause she can actually act and portray unique characters of various dimensions, which this droll affair sorely needed. Instead, we are stuck with Tea Time.  I just got thoroughly sick and tired of that vapid, 90s career girl stereotype.  Now we have the arrogant female chauvinists. That really does not help to serve Womens Liberation; in fact, it is a condescending sexist/stereotyped insult, for it makes them look just as hypocritical and full of s..t as Big White Man.  Also, how does becoming a yuppie sell out help to save your soul and define your (so called) character and self esteem?  Wish that asteroid would strike SOON!!!As you can probably guess, I was not very touched, intrigued, excited, moved, impressed or entertained, but I did manage to catch up on a few winks throughout, and for helping me better cope with my insomnia, I am eternally grateful to the makers of ZERO IMPACT.See you on the dark side of the asteroid.

And those viewers should know that E.R.  has always made a priority of being medically  accurate.DEEP IMPACT begins with a newspaper reporter  on the trail of what she thinks is a juicy  piece of scandal in Washington &#150; possibly  involving the President himself.  To her  horror, she's abducted by the FBI and  brought before the President.  But rather  than being thrown into prison, she's told  that, if she behaves herself, she can come  to a Presidential press conference and ask  the first question.  When she asks that  question and gets her answer, she finds out  that her juicy piece of scandal is really an  impending global disaster -- a comet on a  collision course with Earth.  If it hits,  it'll blast enough dust into the atmosphere  to block the sun's heat and light for a good  long time, which will tend to make staying  alive rather difficult.A team of astronauts is sent into space to  try and destroy the comet.  And in this movie,  they send up REAL astronauts, not a bunch of  oil drillers who've never even been trained  for  space flight.  Everything these guys do  up there looks like real documentary footage,  not like a battle scene from STAR WARS.   Back on Earth, one million people are  selected to go into shelters, in case the  comet can't be stopped.  Some of them are  selected based on their qualifications, the  rest are picked at random, although no one  over 50 gets to be in the random drawing.The general public is told about all this,  and about the status of the mission to destroy  the comet, by the President and other authorities  in a series of messages delivered on national  television.  These television broadcasts are  another ingredient that adds realism to the  story.Unfortunately, the general public's reaction  is not quite so realistic.  We're supposed  to believe everybody would stand by quietly  and obey orders &#150; that the masses would  simply stand at the entrance to the shelter  and look on longingly as the chosen ones  went inside.  More likely, there would be  a lot of violent protest from those who felt  THEY should have been chosen, or someone else  shouldn't have been.   This is one of several  lapses in credibility that make DEEP IMPACT  less effective than it might be.  Another  one is a fellow searching for his girlfriend  among the mobs attempting to flee the disaster,  and finding her almost immediately.   A third one is less obvious, but if you've  read LUCIFER'S HAMMER, the definitive  comet-strike novel, you can't miss it.   If something that big hits the ocean going  that fast, it won't just cause a tidal wave.   It'll flash-boil the water and make it  rain &#150; and rain, and rain, and rain.   Interestingly enough, this was one thing  ARMAGEDDON got right.I still recommend DEEP IMPACT, though, if  you want a look at how this disaster really  might look, rather than just a fun time.Now if only someone would make a movie  out of LUCIFER'S HAMMER.

There are many similarities between the two the Earth is threatened by something coming from the skies and the human race faces elimination, the USA (of course) make the necessary arrangements to avoid the disaster and save the human kind, the movie ends with a naive message of hope.This movie, however, has some originalities The US government chooses to preselect a group of scientists, scholars and artists to go to the shelters and ensure the continuation of the human race. One question pops immediately to my mind would MC Solaar have been preselected by the French Government? I will not dare to speculate about the choices that the Lebanese Government would have made.I enjoyed the performance of Robert Duvall (especially when he started reading Moby Dick) more than the special effects that are inherent to this type of movies. Robert Duvall in command of the spaceship reminds me of Harrison Ford with the Millennium Falcon in Star Wars, and later of Captain Kirk with the USS Enterprise in Star Trek.The most original thing about Deep Impact has Morgan Freeman playing the role of President Beck. It is surprising to see a black man as President of the most powerful country in the world. One might even wonder why is that? Well the answer was given to me by my brother-in-law continuing the comparison between Deep Impact and Independence Day, we find that the WHITE President of Independence Day was a true hero that would not accept a defeat and finally lead the battle that saved the Earth from the aliens; whereas the BLACK President of Deep Impact was a dull president that announced bad news after bad news and that went to the shelters to escape the calamity. You must agree with me that it is a very logical explanation. No white President would have done that, don't you think?

Deep Impact is, at a first glance, more scientific, more of a drama than anything else. But then I started thinking.The plot itself isn't so unbelievable as some comments claim. But there are so many things that this film lacks that simply fails to make it anything else than a very average disaster flick.First of all, I was hoping this movie would be more logical and true to reality. But building immense caves and a complete spaceship with an experimental nuclear engine in less than a year is quite a feat, not to mention the fact that they manage to keep this secret. No way, not the spaceship anyway.How do they get around the comet to land on it? They suddenly approach from behind, as in Armageddon - but there they at least give a plausible explanation. What happens here? To turn a spaceship of this kind around in space would be near impossible, or in the least very, very difficult. A fairly long logic leap.As for the acting, I'm convinced, performances were pretty good. But the tears, the goodbyes, the unbearable brainwashing that Hollywood wants people to sit through is just too much.

For example, the complete destruction on the other side of the Atlantic - England, France, Germany, etc. - is mentioned in a single sentence. The russian crew member on board of the shuttle doesn't even deserve to say good-bye to his family. Mainly he seemed to serve only lines to the rest of the cast. And the music score did its best as well to make you want to hold tight to a Stars & Stripes.It might, just might, be possible that instead of sending a bunch of twenty-something Americans up there to save the world, to use the time of one year until deep impact to gather specialists from around the world to handle the problem. This is not even to mention some of the highly illogical moments in the movie (how is it possible to outrace a wave of water which is moving at supersonic speed on a motorbike?).So, what was positive about this movie? I mentioned the Russian protagonist as flat? Well, that doesn't make him much worse than the rest of the cast - although the actor here probably even didn't have a chance to show he can act. Most of the cast would do better by staying in sit-coms. Only Morgan Freeman and Maximilian Schell stood out in their performances. And, another plus for the movie, Freeman portrayed a black US president.If you want a good disaster movie stay to the 70's Earthquake and the like.

The big picture aspects of the scenario are mainly confined to Freeman's exposition-oriented dialogue, yet his scenes provide only the merest hint of the political and personal anguish that drives his decisions. Otherwise the movie's focused on a few inexplicably bland personal stories - it's impossible to know why	Leoni and her estranged parents were considered to be worthy of such attention. Despite the gravity of the situation, the movie maintains a pretty evenly bland tone, with an extreme failure to register tension - the ultimate saving of the world is almost anticlimatic. By far the best moments are	the special effects-generated impact of the first comet - which are awesome in fact - but even these are undercut by cutting away to Wood's mediocre personal drama, not to mention simply by being too short. And of course, there's little sense of the huge loss that's been incurred by mankind nor of events in the world beyond. Independence Day was not only far zippier but actually managed in its bubble-gum way to convey a better sense of a comprehensive portrait of the event.

People running for that underground maze or something, people crying because they were gonna die, and stuff... everything was old.

Because a comet can fall on your head, a volcano can appear in your town and dinosaurs can eat your head... but you're going to die anyway, right? And this isn't a scary movie at all, so I don't see their point.Another point is that I don't think that NASA is going to find out that a comet is going to collide with the Earth one week before it happens. I mean... a lot of people check out the comets' speed, the comets' orbit and compare them with the Earth's speed and orbit, and then take the conclusion that the comet is going to collide with Earth... more or less... 20 years from now. But one week? Give me a break! NASA people aren't that stupid! I guess they could make the movie telling us about How would it be if the world was going to end 20 years ago?

The bad news is that it plays like a Lifetime Original Feature with a huge special effects budget.  The stories we are forced to follow revolve around nearly flawless, heroic characters whose new-found obstacles are presented in a fog of sentimentality.  James Horner's musical score is a combination between his compositions for FIELD OF DREAMS and TITANIC (and, let's face it, everything in between), and its job is clear to force the intended emotion upon us.The performances were sufficient, but no character's story was developed enough to allow the audience to truly care when the tears start flowing.

There is a two hour wait to see 30 seconds of mediocre special effects (can we say Dante's Peak?) while sitting through a teen wedding and plot holes you could drive a semi through. My advice don't bother.

The plot describes the attempts to prepare for and destroy a 7-mile wide comet, which is expected to collide with the Earth and cause a mass extinction.Deep Impact presents ambitious MSNBC reporter Jenny Lerner,who stumbles onto the story, prompting a White House press conference. United States President Beck announces the government's solution a team of astronauts will travel to the comet and destroy it. The team leader aboard the spaceship Messiah is Spurgeon Tanner, who was once the last man to walk on the moon. However, the mission fails, splitting off a chunk of the comet, now due to land in the Atlantic with the impact sending a 350- foot tidal wave flooding 650 miles inland, destroying New York and other cities. The larger part of the comet, hitting in Canada, will trigger an E.L.E. (Extinction Level Event), not unlike a nuclear winter as dust clouds block out the sun and bring life to an end. President Beck reveals Plan B a cavernous underground retreat constructed to hold one million Americans, with most to be selected through a national lottery. Since teenage amateur astronomer Leo Biederman discovered the comet, his family gets a pass to enter the cave, but his girlfriend Sarah and her parents will be left behind. Meanwhile, still in space, Spurgeon Tanner devises a plan for a kamikaze-styled operation that could possibly save the Earth.Deep Impact is surprisingly good as it is a disaster film that relies mainly on a good story and the characters involved rather than astounding visuals and special effects.It was engaging and interesting from beginning to end.Also,it tries to provide a dramatization of the emotions felt by different people upon knowing that the world may end soon.Special mention should also be given to the brilliant performance of the cast involved in the film.Overall,Deep Impact is a great MUST-SEE science fiction movie.

Simply because it recognizes the people.I love disaster movies as much as the next guy (who doesn't love watching LA bite it?). Big booms, explosions, panic in the streets. It's fun. But Deep Impact uses its excellent special effects in support of the story, not as a replacement.Over the course of the movie, you learn about the characters (main and supporting) and start to care about them. Which means you're invested in their survival (not guaranteed either). Instead of faceless millions, you see individuals in danger, which gives them a much stronger impact.I actually get chills at the climax, not because of the special effects (though it is cool to see New York get slammed by a megawave). It's from the astronauts making the sacrifice without fanfare and making final touching goodbyes to their families. Jenny Lerner and her estranged father on the beach as the wave approaches and her whispering Daddy in their last moments. Sarah's parents holding each other quietly holding each other as people try to flee the wave. Sarah and Leo carrying Sarah's sister to high ground in a desperate attempt to escape the wave.Well worth the two hours and good for those who like both the big bangs and a good story.

The problem, however, is that Armageddon didn't set the bar very high.In a strange way, Deep Impact shares many things with Dante's Peak, another disaster movie released alongside it's dumber cousin, Volcano. Both movies concentrate mainly on the personal relationships of the characters rather than the actual disaster, they both contain some laughable science and both movies climax in an orgy of destruction. The difference, though, is that Dante's Peak does it better.In my opinion, it all comes down to editing.Dante's Peak clips along at a good pace while Deep Impact drags it's feet like a movie on smack. Stereotypical characters drift around in a haze of self-importance, trying to impart upon the audience that they are engaged in something relevant. But in the end, does anyone really care about them? We're given a stock selection of wunderkinder love, a 30-something year-old journalist obsessed with her aged parents divorce (Jenny, freakin' get over it, already!), ageist astronauts, and, the standout performance in a film that exists to shame actors, Morgan Freeman as the president. Surrounding them are a bevy of characters that muddy the film so much that it becomes possible to take extended breaks for popcorn/bathroom breaks/phone calls to your entire extended family.And that is the heart of the films problem. Too many characters. Now I know, the title Deep Impact is most likely a clever reference to the emotional impact the comet has on the people dealing with it but the film loses it's focus rather early and never truly regains it.Being a fan of the genre, I was disappointed in Deep Impact. As a disaster film, Deep Impact, ultimately, is a disaster. It has none of the emotional impact as When Worlds Collide - another cosmic collision flick where people actually behave realistically when faced with their annihilation. Nor does it have the sense of fun that all disaster films need to lighten the moments of darkness - like those provided by Helen Hayes in Airport. Instead, we're served stereotypes, and a too-short city crushing.I think the worst crime that Deep Impact commits is that you have all of these people halfheartedly trying to survive the cataclysm but none of them really know why they are bothering. In The Poseidon Adventure you really feel that everyone is trying to live for something. It's gritty, dramatic and there is a feeling of urgency. Deep Impact has none of this. And, because of that, it comes out as not a drama or a disaster film, but more of a drasaster - we're given the story of too many people we care too little about and too few of them suffer horrible, on screen deaths.The only things that really stood out for me were the lines not said in the film. Maximilian Schell telling his adult daughter that he's a lot happier NOT being married to Vanessa Redgrave and that she's an adult so grow up, already. And Leelee Sobieski thinking Oh, God, I'm sixteen, married to my first boyfriend, I've got an unplanned baby and I'm homeless!

The development of characters was adequate, Michael Tolkin's script was good, the cinematography excellent in all scenes, and the score didn't intrude.Of the comments I read, no one mentioned the edge-of-the-seat scene of the astronauts drilling in the comet. I didn't read one who remembered the space-ship slammed-into the comet, which caused it to break-up with the help of several atomic weapons. Let's go home was a major part of the film, as it showed the astronauts' families, and the acceptance of death by the ship's crew. Very touching.All were excellent in their roles. Robert Duvall (Capt. Fish) and Morgan Freeman (Pres. Tom Beck) always do their jobs well. I'm not too familiar with Elijah Wood (Leo Biederman), but enjoyed his performance. Vannessa Redgrave (Robin Lerner) added a touch of elegance; I was shocked to see how Max Schell (Jason Lerner) has aged; he used to be one of the best-looking actors around, with such a small role - but, played well.Tea Leoni (Jenny Lerner) was o.k. in her role; what dazzle do you expect from a TV-anchor ? The special effects were just enough, not too exaggerated. I thought all of the extras were great - the scene when the smaller comet skims the ocean was very convincingly real-looking. Seems like not many folk realized they only had to get to higher ground to escape the tidal wave.All-in-all, Deep Impact keep my interest and entertained me, too. that's all I ask from a movie.

Brilliantly acted, directed and produced to create an outstanding, emotion evoking piece that will stick with you for a long time. Unfortunately for Deep Impact, as it was released roughly the same time as another film with a similar focus, being Armageddon, it is not usually judged on its own merit, but more often simply in comparison with Armageddon, which is exactly also what i am about to do. Though hopefully i can compare them in a way which shows comparison of them is not necessary. It is a shame for Deep impact as they are truly fundamentally very different. They do share the basic plot of an apocalyptic asteroid/comet on a collision course with earth, but the focus and styles of the two films are different. Armageddon was the big blockbuster, with the big stars in the lead roles and the big effects right the way through the film, exactly what you would expect of a big budget Hollywood action movie. This is where Deep impact differs, as although it has some very famous actors and actresses, (morgan freeman, Elijah wood etc) they are not relied on for making the film truly watchable. Deep impact focuses on people. Real people with real lives and real emotions, and as this extension level event dawns upon them, we are thrown into the lives and relationships of these characters and shown the true emotions they are experiencing. The films portrays the sheer terror of the characters, and the American people with brilliant realism, and we really sympathise with them, and go on the crazy journey of emotion that would begin ,with the news of the end of existence. The narrative superbly twists and weaves through the lives of three different main sets of characters, each with their own problems and issues, and then back into the action as we are constantly reminded of 'time until impact' giving a real atmospheric and very realistic feeling of a countdown to the end of life and everything as we know it. As time runs out, the tension constantly builds throughout the film and the sense of realism is fantastic. Unlike Armageddon, deep impact is not an action films as such. More a drama that has some absolutely astounding action sequences at the end of the film as the climax ensues. It is probably this sense of waiting and relative lack of effects or dramatic shots throughout the first part of the film that makes the action so compelling and emotional when it begins. Deep impact will give you real feelings of sadness, fear, love, anxiety and hope, and what is really compelling about the film is that there is no completely happy ending where everything is resolved and everyone is happy. It is very realistic and at times the tension is almost unbearable. Deep impact, im my opinion is an infinitely and comprehensively better film than Armageddon. It is much more complete, much more tense and atmospheric and the narrative is far more powerful, and really takes the viewer on a roller-coaster ride of emotion with some very powerful messages throughout the film. The thing that really makes deep impact so effective is simply, its subject matter; (the end of the world, which is possibly the most intense and powerful image imaginable) combined with the trials and tribulations of real people with real emotions. It is the way the director invites the viewer into the film and lives this incomprehensible event and the emotions that come with it, through the eyes of the characters, and from several different view points. In my opinion a truly great film.

The action sequences are so few and far between, and so out of place that I often had the distinct feeling of switching between two different movies every now and again.  Another shortcoming of this movie was the overdevelopment of the characters. Although intended to bring the viewer closer to those involved, it actually pushed me further away from them. I wished the damn thing would end so that I could be spared from the insufferably dull (and decidingly ineffective) attempt at entwining my emotions into the characters, who, if they were not busy weeping, were going effectively boring the audience with their blandness. 1 out of 5 "},{"Title":"Very impressive","Date":"2 June 2002","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":"  (Possible spoilers)I saw this movie on BBC1 here in the UK and after seeing it, I just had to go out and buy the movie itself.

Any potential suspense the story may have is smothered under pretentious plot developments interspersed with melodramatic hysterics.SPOILER WARNING!!!The opening astronomy class scene shows a little bit of personality, but the story rapidly deteriorated from there. The worst scene is the contrived, over-the-top hysterical bus-leaving scene. By the end of it, I was seriously wishing the bus would blow up like in SPEED! I had a little bit of sympathy for Leo when he stood up for himself in front of the tunnel; but it didn't compensate too much, and was quickly squelched by the soap opera-style freeway scenes.A lot of people have commented how that thought the tidal wave sweeping away the reporter and her father was farcical. I also thought the shot of the Statue of Liberty head floating among the Manhattan skyscrapers was absolutely ludicrous. And when I saw this film in the theater, the shot of the wave heading towards the home town was the most amateurish looking effect shot I've seen in modern cinema. It looked like it had been shot in someone's bathtub. Even Ray Harryhausen did better shots than that! Admittedly Morgan Freeman's President does show some dignity; but he can't save this movie!Let's hope that film-makers and professional critics have learned that it's ridiculous to expect every type of story to fit strictly to the conventions of an angst-ridden character study. Story plots work a lot better if they play by their own set of rules they're designed for. The 80s-90s policy of analyzing every single film but the same one-size-fits-all theoretical criteria was a WAY stupid idea.

There was a time when there was more of a consensus about what constituted a good movie. Today, opinions, though always valid, are all over the map. The same has happened with popular music... 50 years ago, everyone liked Glenn Miller. Today, you can find hordes that hate even the most accomplished artists. My point is that our tastes and expectations as a population have completely splintered. The wide variety of negative and nit-picky comments here reflect this trend.Having said this, here is why I like this movie, regardless of certain gaps in plot, geography, realism, etc. I am a fan of the old movies. Very rarely in the old movies did anyone fuss over such minor issues as alot of you folk fuss over. What counted was CHARACTERS and STORY. As far as these two elements go, Deep Impact is a completely realized and worthwhile film. And, like many of the old movies, it has a large a colorful cast that is well integrated into the main thread of the plot.Deep Impact is not a disaster movie in the traditional sense of the term. Rather, it is about the personal impact that the threat of worldwide doom has on a representative collection of characters, who happen to be involved in the efforts to stave off calamity. While the film does not immediately address the reaction of the public at large -- perhaps the film's one major flaw -- it choses to gauge the impact of the disaster by examining close-up the lives of individuals -- a literary and storytelling technique as old as Homer or the Bible. In doing so, the film accentuates and dramatizes the emotions of its main characters, and in turn communicates more directly to us the viewer.In chosing this tack for relating its subject matter, the film occasionally lurches into sentimentality, particularly in the final scene where the astronauts sacrifice themselves to save the world. It is here that the viewer senses he is watching actors portraying heroes. But the old movies were replete with this kind of tugging at the emotions, and for me, it still works; I'm just a sentimentalist at heart. And I feel sorry for those of you who have become so hardened by modern life that this has no power over you... You just can't stand the lousy effects or geographical inconsistencies!

But my main gripe is with the poorly written script, the lack of general focus, and the overall insipid acting. Tea Leoni, especially, seems to sleepwalk through her part, never once bringing any conviction her role. Morgan Freeman is wooden throughout and his platitude-ridden speech at the end of the movie is painful to listen to. Just about every major character comes across as boring and I blame the script and director for this.The main problem lies in trying to depict so many different characters' lives in the space of two hours. If the focus had been on one or two people, the script would have been far more cohesive. Lacking this cohesion, we are left with undeveloped characters that we care nothing about. So when Tea Leoni and Maximillian Schell get killed by the tidal wave, we are happy to see them go. The director allows us little vignettes that are supposed to offer us insight into the lives of the characters, but all it does is destroy any focus the movie might have had.A good movie should draw you into its own unique universe, such that your emotional involvement is held captive.

Man vs. Nature films almost always crash and burn (though I still love them), and I feel that Deep Impact is one of the elite few (Jurassic Park being the only other I can think of) that realizes it's true potential, and is a great film in it's own right.The plot seems fairly straightforward. Comet is discovered by Leo, a young kid, and astronomers confirm that it is on a trajectory to earth. In order to prevent a panic the government plans in secret. Jennie, an ambitious reporter covering an adulterous scandal stumbles upon evidence of the comet, and bullies the president into going public.However the story has far more facets. While Armageddon flew by with a typical romance, idiots in space comedy, and special effects, Deep Impact relies on it's characters to move the plot forward. Leo is forced to grow up far before he's ready, and abandon his childhood in order to make adult decisions and save those he loves. Jennie suffers from a strained relationship with her father, who has remarried a woman only two years her senior. Astronauts must sacrifice themselves for a higher cause. Though screen time on each of the stories is limited, just a few lines really get you inside each character's head. They're extremely easy to care about.Morgan Freeman also happens to be the best movie president I've ever watched. His acting, along with the rest of the cast, is top notch.

These men prove this is a film about character.One final, but crucial point In most disaster films, the average person affected behaves in less than human ways, struggling to survive through looting and killing.

Humankind is almost invariably shown at its best, not its worst.Perhaps, the filmmakers are saying, perhaps there is hope for us all. As the President said I wish....No, wish is wrong.

It's a star-like object &#x96; but this one appears where no star is known to exist. He sends a picture of the shiny object to a professional in Tucson, Arizona. After punching some information into a computer, the astronomer (Charles Martin Smith) seems to know exactly what Mr. Wood's object is and where it's headed &#x96; regrettably, his reaction shows the news is not good. Since everyone else in the huge observatory-type building has the day off, the information is put on a floppy disc to be transported on the road. Unfortunately, it is hit by a redneck truck driver gulping caffeinated soda while smoking an elusive cigarette...One year later, our heroine appears &#x96; she is pretty blonde MSNBC reporter Tea Leoni (s Jenny Lerner). How an attractive blonde newsreader is working for MSNBC instead of FOX News is unexplained. Either her skirts aren't short enough, or it's a sign of The Apocalypse. Also note, the President of the United States is played by Morgan Freeman (as Tom Beck). This could be another sign. When a member of Mr. Freeman's cabinet resigns to spend more time with his family, Ms. Leoni smells an extra-marital affair. That's logical, but incorrect. Immediately, the President finds out Leoni is investigating. FBI agents decide to contact Leoni in the safest way possible &#x96; they get in four cars and start ramming her car on what looks like a freeway overpass or bridge...Leoni and Freeman meet in what looks like the White House kitchen. The President wants Leoni to wait before reporting her scoop; in return, he will allow the MSNBC reporter to ask the first question at an upcoming news conference. It sounds like a fair deal. This is when we learn Deep Impact involves an approaching comet which is, of course, on a collision course with Earth. Naturally, we want to divert the comet's path, lest it destroy all life on Earth. Considering the importance of success, it is decided to hit the comet in the safest way possible. Shooting at the comet from Earth is too risky, so a different mission is planned &#x96; a team of astronauts is scheduled to board a spaceship, land on the comet, plant some nuclear bombs and&#x85; KA-BOOM...The Messiah mission team is headed by retired astronaut Robert Duvall (as Spurgeon Tanner), who once walked on Earth's Moon. Before blasting off into space, the younger astronauts go out for a few drinks at the local bar. The crew snubs Mr. Duvall, but he coincidently has gone to the same bar for a drink. Apparently, this is a common way to prepare for space travel. Duvall joins the younger group for some bar-room bonding. It's good that Duvall is now respected by the other astronauts because he is to be the pilot and captain of their mission. Duvall helms the mission with a steady hand. He says Roger that! and manages to calm down the obligatory squirrelly Russian. You'll have to watch for yourself, to see if the Messiah saves everyone...Don't attempt to guess the ending of Deep Impact from what is written above. Something happens during the running time to open up other options. Now, in the event the comet arrives on schedule, President Freeman and the US have a plan for survival. A cavern shelter has been built in Missouri &#x96; it will hold seeds, one million humans (800,000 to be chosen by lottery) and pairs of animals. Yes, it's called Noah's Ark. How to manage this with Doomsday around the corner becomes amusing. The silliest part of the story is the plot involving young Wood, the kid who discovered the comet. Told by a classmate, You're gonna have sex a lot more now than anyone else in your class! due to his fame, Wood takes giant step toward making that come true...Not only does Wood figure out a way to have safe (off-screen) sex, he can hop on his bicycle (and, later, motorcycle) and get anywhere he wants in under two minutes. Now, that's talent. Also, it doesn't matter where you are among millions of frantic people, all trying to travel on thousands of congested highways &#x96; Wood will find you. If there ever is a real Doomsday, your best route to safety would be to find and stick close to Elijah Wood. That being said, lucky Leelee Sobieski (as Sarah Hotchner) does well in her role. It should also be mentioned that Freeman, like the aforementioned Duvall helps by just being there. Freeman is simply good in everything, always delivering his lines and faces to the best possible effect &#x96; no matter what the character or script...Least favorite story goes to Leoni's distressed reporter, despite skillful support from parents played by acting veterans Vanessa Redgrave and Maximilian Schell. Of the other players and plots, Duvall and his crew wind up being best &#x96; once they blast off, you're on board with their mission. This is where director Mimi Leder really scores, as sketchy characters in the intimate setting really engage you more than the manipulative others. The real humanity is with Duvall's crew, and it peaks with an emotional scene involving wounded officer Ron Eldard (as Oren Monash) and his wife (Jennifer Jostyn). The special effects are impressive enough, and Dietrich Lohmann's photography looks great. This was Mr. Lohmann's last film assignment, and he deservedly receives a dedication.****** Deep Impact (5/7/98) Mimi Leder ~ Tea Leoni, Elijah Wood, Robert Duvall, Morgan Freeman "},{"Title":"Another (Independents Day), more human, and more boring !","Date":"4 September 2013","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":" Back then, the end of the world was a fashion in disaster movies. (Independence Day &#x96; 1996) and (Armageddon &#x96; 1998) were a few examples. Director (Mimi Leder) wanted to set a different example, by utilizing the same theme, yet not in another thriller action, but in a romantic drama. So the goal wasn't an adventurous ultra-dazzling dream, which leaves a celebratory testosteronic impact; it was a tender human message which leaves a soul-stirring deep impact. Though that didn't do well I'm afraid. Not due to the concept, however due to its applying. The story-lines aren't that effectively emotional. Some of them were too hopelessly romantic; reaching my rank of sensitive crap, and sure I'm talking about matters like that father who chooses death by the sea, then his daughter who chooses the same thing. I deem it one of the most misunderstood scenes in movie history; whereas it's not reconciliation between the 2 characters, it is committing suicide !! I felt situations like let's die to save the world and have some schools named after us were obviously fabricated for the sake of some melodramatic tears. Well, the movie has a bad load of passionate naivety. Look at (Morgan Freeman). He was glossy ideal man, with no drama. If he was made as a narrator; nothing would have differed (or &#x96; in fact &#x96; it would have been better !). The whole movie feels like one hasty soap opera. And what bothers even more; is that it ends up as a cold exploitation of the (Independence Day) theme, while pretending being something a lot warm and serious. (Téa Leoni) isn't attractive as a woman or an actress. Big names like (Freeman) and (Robert Duvall) were wasted in trivial cameo-like roles. There were so many children in the third act; everybody had a kid to goodbye or leave to others or die with, while the human relationships dictionary has more than that ! Some of the movie's posters misled the audience, picturing the movie as a sci-fi, while sci-fi was merely a tool in the movie's realm. But still, the problem of not delivering the main goal appropriately can't be outmatched. While it's too much ado about how true feelings must be expressed at the right time before it is too late, or before the end of the world (meteorically and literally)&#x97;it kills me that that right message was said in not so right way ! (James Horner) music gets so close to great at times. The CGI is highly truthful. The last 15 minutes are the movie's best. However nothing intercedes for (Deep Impact) not being deep disappointment !For all the ones who refused (Deep Impact) by simply comparing it to its predecessor (Independence Day), you're not right comparing noisy propagandizing action to sedate pure drama, but you're so right comparing them in terms of which one was more loyal to its purpose, and perfect in the way of achieving that purpose, where it's easy to discover that the first is less than good, and the other is very good. So yes, eventually (Deep Impact) is more human Independents Day, but more boring as well !As for movies with tender human messages, (Mimi Leder) made better ones, like (Pay It Forward &#x96; 2000).

A big old boy who threatens to put period to the whole shebang and his bitty bad boy sibling, who only means to end life as we know it.  Add first rate special effects and a strong cast and a good movie is the result - (right?)No, wrong, actually.Scientific credibility was thrown out of the window in order to support a molasses of icky sentimentality more awesome in its engulfing power than the tsunami so breathtakingly portrayed in the script.Morgan Freeman is the idealist's identikit president, cobbled together out of a wish list of values long on pious, high minded verbiage and very short indeed on the ruthless pragmatism that one suspects would really be shown in such circumstances.Dependable Robert Duvall heads a crew of selfless but sanctimonious astronauts, who speak every sentence as if some future extra terrestrial species is going to rerun this after mankind has collectively bit the dust and say 'What noble beings! Too bad they got deep sixed by a damn comet'The trouble with gushy sentiment of the sort let loose here is that it is like some terrible contagion that strikes down every one who comes into contact with it.  So it is with the cast of this movie by the end of which there is not one realistic character left - merely a mankind able only of speaking in humble, self effacing little homilies.By this time, I was cheering for the comet - by the way, if it really had come so close the odds are that, rather than being saved to endlessly humbug and piously prattle, mankind's ass would have been ashes anyway !The sad thing is that there was potentially a memorable movie here but a bad script, awful characterisation and the triumph of the 'ooh' and 'ahh' of the eye candy of admittedly spectacular special effects over scientific reality scuppered the show.Unpleasant to see such a talented cast wasted also.RatingComet sense to give this a less than earth shattering 4 out of 10  "},{"Title":"NBC's most expensive made-for-TV movie yet","Date":"15 April 2001","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":"  When I first saw it, I thought, That's going to be the worst movie I see for a long time.  Then I saw Armageddon, which surprised me by being actually *much* worse than Deep Impact.  Having just now watched D.I. for the second time (on television), I have to say it's not as bad this time, maybe because I've seen so many bad movies since then.But it's still not something that deserves to be on the big screen.  It's pure television melodrama, with a huge budget.  It has its moments, namely in the script.  Tea Leoni does a better job than I gave her credit for the first time.  And I give it some credit for having the courage to kill some characters you're urged (and you are urged) to care about.That doesn't change the fact, though, that it's still woefully contrived, predictable, and downright unrealistic to the point of being annoying.  But perhaps the most annoying part is the epic product placement.  Forget six degrees of Kevin Bacon; let's see how many connections to NBC we can find in Deep Impact.  We have MSNBC practically painted on each frame of the film.  (Which only made it more unrealistic.  MSNBC as a primary news source?  Gimme a break.)  We have a former director of E.R. as director, and Dreamworks (produces E.R.) as the production company.  And we have a veritable who's who of current and past actors of NBC programs Tea Leoni (The Naked Truth), Laura Innes (E.R.), Ron Eldard (E.R.), Richard Schiff (The West Wing), Blair Underwood (L.A. Law.), Bruce Weitz (Hill Street Blues).  Am I leaving anyone out?  I don't know how much NBC forked over for this two-hour long commercial, but they didn't do themselves any favors with it.  It just makes me question their judgment that much more.Better than I thought originally, upon second viewing, but only because I was watching it on TV, where it belonged in the first place.

Who's playing tonight? Some no-stretch-cast actors and a no-stretch action-director. Why should this film have been made? Because it thoughtfully brought into the spotlight the reality of obliteration by an asteroid? NO. It's all wrong, to start, and it's all pap to boot. Let's do some science-fact scouring here asteroids aren't burning balls of flame that scientists can see from lightyears away - those are stars. Asteroids are black. Space is black. The chances of anyone seeing an asteroid are profoundly minimal, considering the previous fact and that fact that space is, LITERALLY, unimaginably vast and empty. The only way to spot this asteroid would be if we were told exactly where it was and where to look; even then we'd only be able to see it as it passed in front of stars and blocked them from view. You see how hard it is to spot a block of ice that reflects virtually no light and hence is completely black against a black backdrop? These 'film-makers' don't.Also... let's talk about the movie, perhaps. (I'm watching it right now, actually, it's on TV.) Téa Leoni has just been pulled over by the FBI in a way wholly un-governmental by bashing their cars against hers. Are they Hillbillies? Are they? No, they're not...And, OH! the sentimentality of it all. Of Elijah bloody Wood and his girlfriend. I always find it hilarious when an action director (Michael Bay in mind) talks about his films like they are true pieces of art the 'human' aspect of the film, the 'conflict of interchanging character interfaces as represented against a backdrop of political and societal ruminations', etc., etc....Just suppose, for a moment, that Hollywood got its arse in gear altogether and began producing - not REproducing - real movies like they once did. I don't mean real movies like ANYbody makes nowadays, I mean real movies like real masterpieces of interesting stories - that's right, STORIES - and wonderful characters, and managed to employ some real directors and real actors and real producers. What would it be like if these movies I speak of were in production? Does anyone think they'd be anything like THIS muckapiece? No! Why, you ask impatiently? Because THIS is a crap film. Because THIS is a crap action film. Because THIS is a crap action film about science - which they got wrong. That is why nobody should see this film anymore. That's why it's only enjoyable because it's a lightweight cascade through self-referential sentiment and self-conscious actors. Watch it if you want to feel prosperous about a future career making BETTER movies than this.Robert Duvall was in BOTH the Godfather masterpieces.

Armageddon. How stupid could anyone be, to think that releasing these two movies at almost the exact same time would be a good idea? And who could be stupid enough to think that either of these movies would be great? Time has told us repeatedly that disaster movies, especially natural disaster movies, fill a laughable space in movie-dom, where soap opera characters, lame plot twists, and poor writing fill every inch of the frame, every minute of the film. And this one is no exception. (Neither is Armageddon, but that's a different story.)Deep Impact fails miserably on a few levels. The first is the shallow attempts at characters. There were too many, as is usually the case in these films, and they have no depth. Instead, they are given obvious, average traits, and made to act in ways that would allow the audience to easily identify with them. They were stand-ins for the audience, where most people could say that man/woman is just like me, or someone I know, and wouldn't it be horrible if that happened to us?, and the movie could get away without developing them past the lowest common denominator of all generic characters.All the emotions, then, are simply there to manipulate us, and take our emotions in the direction the movie wants. Many fine movies do this, in one way or another, and I'd let that go, if it were the only flaw It isn't. None of the emotions come off as genuine. The acting is flat, the direction weak, and the script isn't concerned with any development beyond manipulation. None of it means anything, in the context of the film.And then there's the special effects. I assume some intern on his lunch break over at ILM did the worthless excuse for effects that we saw all of during the preview. Yeah, all the effects were in every commercial, and they only filled about five seconds there. The comet FX in both comet movies were poor, which is strange, considering they were largely the subject matter. But otherwise, Armageddon did serve up the effects, good and bad, where Deep Impact skimped on them at every possible turn. And that isn't a plus, ultimately.The direction, if we're to call it that, is bad. Mimi Leder has yet to do a good job directing anything, and from the bland cinematography to the uninspired acting, this is no bid for respectability. Big script disappointments include never even glimpsing the underground haven, and having the end fizzle with some rather unrealistic, last-minute, feel-good moments that are as implausible as anything in Armageddon.I guess, because this movie is very conventional, and because it's a lot nicer than Armageddon in tone, people might like it more. Armageddon never strays, in content, from being exactly what it tells us it will be. And at least it does it well technically. (I'm not interested in any old lady comments about it being too loud, or too fast. Those traits alone don't make it bad.) But this one lies to us, telling us it's about so much more than it ever even comes close to, and doesn't have the technical skill to make it work, and for that, I can't forgive it.

This sequence comes too late in the movie, though, as most people will have already fallen asleep.  Special mention also goes out to the flying wad of questionable white goo that is the comet - one of the worst, flattest looking CGI renderings I have ever seen that had my brother screaming praises of its fakeness.ELIJAH WOOD In a category all by himself because he is THAT BAD.  His character has no point, his acting is poor, and the scene where he kisses his wife (God...the mere fact that idea even made it past the first draft boggles the mind) is soooo ridiculous and poorly done that it's almost worth the price of rental just to see how bad it is.  THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO FRENCH KISS YET AND THEY'RE MARRIED! I shouted, enraged, when I saw it in theaters.Eight dollars to see it in the theaters was an outrage.  I will not pay the three to see it on video.  If it was on HBO I would not watch it.  This film sucked, plain and simple.

All of the excitement comes at the end in a series of very poorly done special effects shots, with the most banal music playing in the background. This one has to be one of the worst films I've ever sat though. Is it poorly shot, no of course not. It's very professionally produced. Is the cast good, yes, of course. In fact, I can't imagine what might have drawn such a good cast to such a dud of a script. This film is so dull, so banal, so lacking in imagination it makes 2012 look like transcendent cinema.

It is a disaster movie, nothing more, nothing less, with a lot of special effects. It is a movie, like Independence Day, that you go and see to watch New York get completely smashed. Generally it is not really worth the money to go and see except for watching the special effects on the big screen.The movie begins with a young boy, who happens to be a genius, discovering a comet heading towards Earth. A report is sent to a professional astronomer who dashes off to warn everybody but is killed in a car accident. This car accident adds absolutely nothing to the plot except to show a car crash scene. The whole thing is covered up but something is revealed when the vice president resigns because of allegations regarding a girl named Ellie. A reporter is put on the case and soon learns that this Ellie is a little more important than simply a sex scandal in the White House. Actually it deals with what is termed as an extinction level event.There are three stories running through this movie, as tends to happen with such movies as they are too shallow to hold a single plot. There is the kid who discovered the comet and his relationship with the girl. This is probably to appeal to the teenagers, and there is the reporter (Tia Leoni) and her desire to become an anchor and her relationship with her mother and father in light of the end of the world. Then there are the astronauts who are on a mission to stop the comet.A lot of people claim that the movie's examination of the end of the world is what makes it good and they believe that this is what will happen. I am somewhat sceptical because the end of the world will be a sudden thing, we won't see it coming and when it does we will be powerless to stop it. In Deep Impact, they were able to save the world, but in reality we cannot, because it will involve fighting God and that we cannot do. Movies like Deep Impact try to create a hope that does not exist. We want hope that we can survive without God but the truth is we cannot. The American President will not save us nor will a bunch of cowboy astronauts. The only person who can save us is Christ, and all we can do is to trust him.

If you really want to see a good asteroid movie - watch Armageddon - it has more likable characters and although the cast of Deep Impact all did a great job - they weren't quite the sort of mix young people (12-30) really like. I just can't say much more really -this movie is awful. It has no action what-so-ever. This story tries to create a sense of hope - the only hope I had was for the end credits to start rolling up. The love story is non existant. It doesn't quite get the sense of realism with the characters - mainly - not many of them die. More characters in it should have died to make this movie more emotional - but they didn't.This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I wouldn't even recommend it to the person I most hated in the world - simply because it is just too awful I wouldn't even feel good letting anyone sit through this.

One astronomer spots a comet and in about 10 seconds realises it's going to hit the Earth, so what does he do, he tries to send an Email which doesn't work.  Now as this comet is about a year away what does he do.  Does he try to send the mail later, use the phone, send a disc in the mail, no that would be silly.  We must get this disk to Washington NOW.  Of course the car crashes, he is killed and you assume the disk is destroyed in the ensuing fire.Now some time later the president is perfectly aware of this and even has the now destroyed disk, so what was the point of the first scene. The film carries on is this pointless stupid manner.  There is a brief part of the film where there is some intrigue, but even that's handled is such a ridiculous way.   Why would the president personally meet a reporter to scare her.The rest of the film is some drivelling soap opera that bores you to tears.  I spent the last third of the movie hoping the comet could hurry up a bit and wipe out these sad whinging losers.Now the Earth (i.e. America) has a year (I think) to be able to come up with a number of ideas of how to stop this comet.  So what we (when I say we I mean of course America who represent the whole of planet Earth) do is send a bunch of young gun-ho Americans on some stupid mission to blow up the comet.  With comical timing they fail miserably.  So what now, bugger, we don't know, of course no one else on planet USA knows how to stop this thing.The stupidest scene is at least kept until the end.  There's a group of fleeing people who decided to flee a few hours before the comet turned up, I mean they only had a year and are stuck in traffic.  A few minutes later they were all kicking themselves from their watery grave.  All they had to do was run up the mountain about 100 feet away from where they were.

Basically scientists, including Dr. Marcus Wolf (The Untouchables' Charles Martin Smith) discover a large comet heading for Earth, but were killed before they could report it. At least eight months later, people including reporter Jenny Lerner (Téa Leoni) for one, lead their pretty normal lives, that is until President Tom Beck (a well cast Morgan Freeman), announces to the world that a comet heads for Earth, and that a team of astronauts will be heading out to send it off course. The team of the ship named 'Messiah' include Captain Spurgeon 'Fish' Tanner (Robert Duvall), Dr. Oren Monash (Ron Eldard), Andrea 'Andy' Baker (Mary McCormack) and Mark Simon (Blair Underwood), and as for everyone on Earth, the President wants everyone to continue like normal. The mission unfortunately fails, because the drill for planting the bomb in the meteor didn't go deep enough, so the meteor is now in two halves, one little, one huge. The President informs people however that in this event, there have been preparations for living in some protective caves, until the dust from the disaster settles, and there is a lottery to select other people to join all the important people (e.g. doctors, scientists) already chosen. So you can imagine all the hysteria made both by the people who have been selected, and those who haven't, Leo Beiderman (Elijah Wood) was sure marrying Sarah Hotchner (Leelee Sobieski) would guarantee both their families would get in, but it didn't. In the end, Jenny settles her differences with father Jason (Maximilian Schell), and Leo and Sarah ride away from danger, the smaller portion of the meteor does strike the Earth, creating the world's highest tidal wave going through New York and a few other cities nearby, but sacrificing themselves, the Messiah does destroy the remaining portion with the ship and two nukes left on board. Also starring Vanessa Redgrave as Robin Lerner, James Cromwell as Alan Rittenhouse, Jon Favreau as Dr. Gus Partenza, The Lost World Jurassic Park's Richard Schiff as Don Beiderman and Enigma's Dougray Scott as Eric Vennekor. I think the title relates to both the meteor hitting, and the human relationships, but whatever, it is a very good all-star cast in a really engaging science-fiction drama. Very good! "}]
