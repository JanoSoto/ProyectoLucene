During the jump Andy manages to save the life of a girl attempting suicide.  However when he later tries to find her again he finds that she has something to hide.  When he and his friends attend a party held by friends for hers they find they are trapped by werewolves.  Andy gets bitten and becomes part of a world he wants no part of.This is a belated sequel to the 1980's classic `American Werewolf in London' and indeed it tries very hard to be just like it - the corpse black humour, the dreams within dreams sequences etc.  However the story is different as it introduces a wider werewolf conspiracy idea to the plot.  It actually works quite well - it's not better than many other creature features but it works OK.The main problem with it is that it is very much another teen horror movie - with a stupid rock soundtrack, valley girl style humour and dumb spectacle.  It lacks the original's black humour and it isn't anywhere near as tense as `London'.  The special effects are totally CGI and they don't work as well as `London's' - it all looks too computerised, and seeing everything takes the scare factor out of it.In fairness when you look at it as a stand-alone film it's not so bad even though it doesn't stand out from other teenage horror movies.  But a sequel to `London'? - sorry but it's not a great addition to that piece of work. Tom Everett Scott looks like he's stepped out of American Pie into a horror movie!  He's OK but he doesn't compare with Dunne all those years ago.  Julie Delphy is actually quite good - she doesn't have much of a character but she carries herself well.  The other characters are either rough French skinheads or American teens.Overall it's entertaining enough - but it pales terribly when compared to the original. "},{"Title":"So what next?

But still, An American Werewolf in Paris definitely has its moments. Some scenes were no doubt thrown in for comic relief, like You can't just pop up and tell me what to do. I agree with a previous reviewer that people who slam this movie are comparing it too much to An American Werewolf in London. Maybe there's a slight feeling of that one, but you have to take this one as something new - and rather campy - to really enjoy it. Tom Everett Scott and Julie Delpy do a pretty cool job. But either way, I think that I've had my fill of movies about US citizens becoming lycanthropes in the Old Continent.So what do YOU plan to do the next time that there's a full moon?

I suppose you can't really describe it as an original werewolf movie either since the bare bones of the story steal elements from the one set in London An American tourist visits a famous European capital , he narrowly survives a werewolf attack that kills a colleague , he embarks ( Pardon the pun ) on a sexual relationship with someone in the medical profession , he turns into a werewolf , he's visited by apparitions of his dead victims , etc etc . and reading the previous line I've just discovered how much the storyline has in common with the original that it seems very similar indeed . The difference lies in how enjoyable and entertaining the Landis movie is With this Paris based movie there's no scenes that really stand out . There's no naked man waking up in a zoo wondering how he's going to get back home with no money or clothes , there's no bizarre dream sequence of Naziwerewolves and there's no spectacular climax . AAWIP does try to be funny but is there anything more embarrassing than failed humour ? I'm thinking of the scene where Andy McDermott has to convince someone he's got chewing gum in his pocket and not condoms ! Perhaps the biggest difference between the two movies is that there's no poignancy involved with this dubious follow up . You really do feel sorry for the protagonist's fate and dilemma in the London movie , here you just feel Andy is nothing more than a cypher going through the literary motions of a script . There's also a large number of plot holes visible . Is this the first time The Lunar Club have carried out a massacre ? If not then aren't large numbers of corpses with their hearts torn out been reported in the world's press ? Why haven't the police got leads ?Everyone else has mentioned it and so will I - The visuals are poor . Look at the bungee jumping scene at The Eifell Tower , it's painfully obvious that it's achieved via some blue screen projection while the werewolf transformation is done by some very cartoonish CGI . I won't put Anthony Waller in the same bracket as Stephen Sommers as a director who totally ruins a movie because of an over reliance on CGI ( The major problem with AAWIP is the screenplay coupled with a high degree of expectation from those who saw the 1981 movie classic ) but I would have preferred the Rick Baker type special effects used for the transformation . To be fair it's reasonable to speculate that perhaps the budget didn't stretch that far . But at the end of the day this is a fairly poor horror movie that didn't need to be made and DOG SOLDIERS is much better entertainment "},{"Title":"A genuinely hilarious horror film.","Date":"25 February 2004","Score":"20 out of 32 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  An American Werewolf in Paris is an excellent horror-comedy, in the great tradition of The Lost Boys and Fright Night.

It certainly doesn't have the talent that was involved on that one. No John Landis. No David Naughton. No Jenny Agutter and other more-than-competent actors. No Rick Baker and dazzling, innovative special effects. I could go on...and on. But if one distances themselves from seeing this film as a sequel(and really it is not a sequel at all...it doesn't have any of the same characters from the first film), this film is not that bad on its own. Sure it is relying on your memories of the London film to get fannies in the seats. Yep, it uses the same character TYPES and situations(dead victims talking and being funny comes to mind quickly). Other than that and the fact that werewolves are involved(and a romance of course), I found few other similarities. This film is definitely going for more laughs and takes itself even far less serious than An American Werewolf in London. The leads...Scott and Delpy are pretty good. The rest of the actors are pretty good too, with Julie Bowen as a slutty American and the guy playing Claude particularly good. I also loved all the French police and the gentle humour inherent in every line they said. The script has some genuine scares laced throughout the picture but always comes back to the humour. French werewolves enjoying feasting on Americans was a particular funny storyline. Director Anthony Waller creates a fast-paced film with some excellent sequences interspersed with some sophomoric plot strands. By no means is this a great film, or even a great horror film/spoof, but it is a film that should grab and hold your attention. Make you jump a few times and laugh out loud now and then.

But An American Werewolf in Paris is an exception, sort of.  Tom Everett Scott stars as a daredevil who tours Europe with his buddies, performing outrageous stunts.  During one particular escapade, he saves the life of a young woman (Julie Delpy) who tries to commite suicide.  Thinking she's the girl of his dreams, little does he know what he's getting into.Paris tries to be a mixture of different genres it wants to work as a horror film (to a mild extent), an action/adventure, and as a comedy.  Dog Soldiers was definitely far superior at these aspects, but AAWIP's campy approach makes it a decent timewaster.  There's not a single boring moment, though a lot of the material is admittedly very silly.  Thankfully, none of it's taken very seriously, and some of the humor is actually very funny.  Scott and Delpy (who's probably the third most beautiful French actress I've ever seen, behind only Mathilda May and Sophie Marceau) have good chemistry together, even if Scott's performance is a little on and off.  The werewolf effects are obviously CGI, but more serious effects work would have ruined the campy mood.

That film had it's funny moments, it was still more of horror tale than anything else. This updated version, now set in Paris, does not have that edge at all and simply isn't in the same class....but it does have some good things going for it that the first film did not have and overall it's still fun to watch. So, werewolf purists aside, most of whom think this film is pure garbage compared to the London version, I'll still give it decent marks since I don't care what others think. I liked it even though I agree London is better and I prefer that version, too. The first 30-40 minutes of this movie is strictly played for laughs including a hysterical scene with a balloon in a restaurant. It also introduces the lead female character, played by Julie Delpy. I don't see enough of this actress. She doesn't seem to make that many films, or least ones I hear about over here in America. This French actress has a face that is classic beauty, so the film got points for having her in it, and she looks great.When the horror starts, it can get scary and the special effects are good. I also liked the lack of profanity in this film, unlike the first one no f-words and no Lord's name in vain - amazing!However, there are plenty of sexual remarks and there is one scene with a guy running out of bar tied to a cross which was blasphemous to me. The soundtrack is heavy metal which isn't appealing to a middle-aged guy like me, either. This film is geared a lot more toward 20-somethings, if that helps anyone.It's entertaining.....just don't expect it to live up to the first film.

Stay away from this tripe.For one thing, the supposedly high-tech special effects are terribly disappointing. Hard to believe that even though the original movie was made 14 years before this one, its SFX are actually more realistic, mostly because the transformation scenes in this movie often happen either off-camera or while the character is running behind something.Also, the humor in the movie falls short. Granted, the chewing gum skit was pretty funny, but as I walked out of the theatre I was pretty ashamed of myself for laughing at such an immature joke. The Eiffel Tower scene is funny only because of its felonious breaking of the laws of physics (Uh, since the Tower spreads outward, wouldn't these bungee jumpers wind up slamming into it at some point during their fall?)And finally, the plot is simply insulting. Even though the original movie had little more behind its story than I'm a werewolf, oh no that is even better than this stereotypical drivel about an anti-American punk who wants to purify the world from the country. If that's not bad enough, their method (luring Gen-X tourists into a club to meet their grisly deaths) is awful inefficient. And to top it off, there are numerous mentions and depictions of eating/drinking someone's heart (including a scene in which Julie Delpy sticks a human heart in a blender - yummy), none of which are suitable for anyone with a stomach.As stated in the beginning, if you really want to see a good werewolf movie, the original 1983 film will suit you just fine. But if you rent this one, be warned the producers and writers spent more time getting Bush to sing the theme song than they did writing the plot.

For starters, it's important to note that An American Werewolf in London (AAWiL) will always have a special place in my heart as one of the first horror movies I remembers seeing on HBO as a kid.This movie lacked just about everything that AAWiL had good acting, good special effects, a decent soundtrack, etc. Tom Everett Scott is a terrible actor... the kind of actor I see and wonder how he ever gets casted for anything. Julie Delpy is OK and I dig her accent. Everyone else was pretty much fluff and/or fodder. The effects were God awful. It's hard enough to pull off CGI monsters and hairy ones are even harder to make believable. When you are making a sequel for a movie that had effects that are still impressive by today's standards, some serious effort has to be made if the intent is to make a movie that rivals the original. This one isn't even in the same league as AAWiL. The music for AAWiL was also very well done. AAWiP had... Bush? Yeah, that's the route you want to go to create a timeless classic.Unlike other reviews I wouldn't even go so far as to say this movie would have good as a stand-alone (no connection to AAWiL), but I wouldn't even give it that much credit.

Among the better features here is the action along the way here, which has such a great feel in generating the kind of extravagant pace that's required here. This starts off nicely with the rescue attempt on the Eifel Tower but really gets good here with the massacre at the club which takes place in the underground catacombs as not only is the escape attempt in the underground tunnels being really exciting in those creepy places but the action of ripping apart the others trapped upstairs makes this an utterly enjoyable time. There's the great encounter with the strapped-down werewolf in the basement that's rather fun, and another big chase through a cemetery as the stalking and escape attempts get even more fun times in here, while the biggest scene here is the final assault in the second club sequence where they interrupt the second party in grand fashion resulting in the chaos from their disruption and panic, the confrontations with the police and finally getting to the big brawls down in the catacombs and out onto the subway train for some incredibly enjoyable action scenes throughout this. As well as what happened in the original, there' s some rather fun times here with the light-hearted comedy here that's a great deal funnier as the same gags with the decomposing corpses appearing to him, only there's a lot of fun with their appearances often coming up in the most inopportune places to manipulate the situation against him. These here manage to hold off what is really the one lone flaw in here but which is incredibly detrimental to this one. The fact is that this one is absolutely littered with appalling, atrocious CGI really lowers this one as practically every frame of werewolf activity here is caused by this. Very rarely does it use them for anything else, resulting in horrible transformations and attacks that look completely ridiculous that never once looks believable or convincing, which is even more problematic considering what happened in the original where this wasn't a factor at all. Not only that, but the design tries way too hard to emulate the original which makes it look cheap altogether. These here are what hold this one down.Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Nudity and a sex scene.

How it's inferior in every way. As such my opinions were exceptionally low before I started watching. And you know what? I had a blast! It may be inferior to its predecessor but that doesn't stop it being a totally entertaining B-movie with lots of (dumb) humour to keep it enjoyable. This is an inoffensive comedy/horror yarn with plenty of bloody gore effects and alarming makeup, some sick humour, lots of werewolves and some cool action bits to keep it running smoothly along.On the plus side, the Paris setting makes for a nice change even if nothing much is made of it - aside from the expected Eiffel Tower shenanigans. What I liked most were the mostly French supporting cast, who are actually pretty good in their roles and a lot more convincing than the American leads on whom the film focuses. People like Pierre Cosso as the villain Claude and Tom Novembre as the Inspector put in solid turns and fit their parts well. As for the leads, well let's just say that the supporting Phil Buckman and Vince Vieluf are no actors, but their parts are fairly minor in any case. Tom Everett Scott, as the lead who becomes a werewolf, is no great actor either, but he's at least passable in the role and not too irritating. Unlike Julie Delpy, a supposedly alluring French actress who I just find to be annoying.It's true that some scenes of this film are misjudged, like the comedic bungee jumps which bookend the production and are badly mishandled. So, too, are the rotting ghosts of the werewolf victims doomed to walk the earth. In the first film Griffin Dunne was a genuine symbol of black comedy at its bleakest; here, the characters are used for cheap scares and gross-out humour like eyeballs dropping out. Not needed. The dumb American characters are pretty unappealing too and the music far too hip for its own good.On the plus side, the film is liberal with its violence and bloodshed, which is always nice to see, and the werewolves themselves aren't as bad as I was led to believe. Sure, the CGI effects are unconvincing as always, but what reviewers neglect to mention is that the appearance of these creatures actually manages to be frightening, leading to a lot of effective jolt moments. The parties at which the werewolves rip apart their victims and cause havoc recall the best bits of FROM DUSK TILL DAWN and are a visceral delight. The plot, although clichéd and contrived, keeps moving along and keeps you watching. AN American WEREWOLF IN Paris is never boring. Deeply flawed perhaps, but surprisingly entertaining in a brain-dead kind of way and worth at least one watch for horror buffs.

However, keep in mind, this film was a product of the 90's, it appeared a year after 'Scream' and at the time it was probably trying to revamp some interest in the werewolf sub-genre of horror.Tom Everett Scott is pretty nerdy here, and I'm okay with that, he plays that role well, being infinitely less cool as his friends are. Julie Delpy plays his love interest well enough, her character is pretty shallowly written, so she works around that one well, I guess. Vince Vieluf and Phil Buckman are slightly memorable here as Tom Everett Scott's friends, and even more memorable is Julie Bowen (Adam Sandler's love interest in 'Happy Gilmore') in a smaller role.It's kind of arbitrary to give away plot points, because in the horror film, we usually know how this one is going to end up, but there's moments here and there where 'An American Werewolf In Paris' takes all those classic horror clichés and blends them up nicely. It's like this movie was in the right place at the right time, but maybe I'm just being biased because these crappy 90's horror flicks will always hold a special place in my evil little heart.

Furry people were thus not destined to look good when rendered by computer. This is the only example I can think of where effects for a well-funded sequel took a giant leap back landing well behind those of the original movie. For the record, the design of the werewolves doesn't help a bit. The film-makers apparently couldn't decide between quadruped and biped, tried to do both, and wound up with a creature that looks equally awkward either way. The transformations are anatomically nonsensical and the end result with a relatively high forehead and short snout looks like a cross between Ron Perlman and a hyena. But back to the crass part. This is a movie which exists PURELY to cash in on its forebear. I am not a fan of Landis' original film but boy, does it look good in light of this.

Which combined horror and comedy with equal thrills. This film featured clever direction. Groundbreaking special effects and superb comedic and serious acting. It was entitled 'An American Werewolf in London.' Sixteen years later the long awaited sequel was finally pinned onto the poster board outside your local theater. Surely it would have at least some of the thrills of the original. Think again. 'An American Werewolf in Paris' is an incomprehensible mess from start to pitiful finish. The problems begin with the leading man. Tom Everett Scott's performance is stiff and tiresome. From the outset he seems intent on proving that all young people are simpletons. In his defense, not even a seasoned Shakespearean thespian could have extracted a good performance from the juvenile and witless dialogue. At one point, one of Scott's deceased friends, who's soul is doomed to walk the Earth after being carved up by one of the werewolves, Is finally able to leave for the afterlife. He then quips to Scott and his friends. 'Okay guys, see ya.' What a memorable goodbye. Julie Delphy soon shows up as Scott's mysterious European love interest. Basically, she's a French girl playing the French girl. It isn't much of a stretch. But all this stupidity isn't even the most disappointing thing about the film. The special effects, such an integral part of the superb original film, fall far short in this flop. The werewolves look like cartoons. And no matter how well you sculpt a cartoon with sinewy lycanthrope muscles. It's still hard to get scared of a cartoon. So instead the vacationing American gang, led by the ultra weak Scott, keep finding excuses to return to the werewolf's catacombs lair. Here it's much easier for this incompetent special effects crew to keep the computer enhanced creatures or absurd beast masks under the cover of darkness. Some have said that if you don't look on this film as a sequel it's not as bad by comparison. I disagree, this film can not stand on its own, and is even more of a disgrace when compared to the brilliant original. If it doesn't want to be looked on as a sequel it should not have borrowed most of the title from the 1981 film. I , don't care how much you love werewolves. Or how much you worshiped 'American Werewolf in London.' as I myself did. This one is simply not worth wasting your time. 'Okay guys, see ya.' Terrible. 3 out of a possible 10 T.H.

Nice opening.The general rule of sequels made this long after the original is that they're just cashing on the success of the others, and they really ain't good. Look at The Godfather III or the Star Wars prequels as the best examples. But is this one going to break the mould? An American jock called Andy McDermott is on a 'daredevil' tour of Europe with three friends. He decides he's going to bungee jump off the Eiffel tower for a stunt, but there he meets a girl named Serafine who is committing suicide, and he rescues her with the help of his bungee cord in a pretty neat sequence. As it turns out, this girl is the product of that steamy little shower scene in the original movie and has inherited some of her fathers traits. The title is probably the smartest thing about this movie. It is of course a reference to the original, but also it references the 1951 Gene Kelly classic An American in Paris. Smart.

But unfortunately, I think that's pretty much all the original ideas that this movie has. After that we're left with basically a teen comedy, with no real horror scenes, plenty of boredom and no sense of continuity. D'oh! There's not a whole lot of respect for the original either. For example, in the original the victims of th e werewolf remained in limbo until the wolfs bloodline was severed. Here, all they need is for the one werewolf who killed them to die. Hmm.It's a real shame, because the seeds were all here for a good sequel, aside from that terrible decision to use completely CGI werewolves (what were they thinking???). The cast are all pretty decent ... Tom Everett Scott was actually an okay choice for the lead in my opinion, as he does remind me of David Naughton sometimes.

What made American Werewolf in London work was it was more of a serious film than a comedy, and the comedy was wonderfully dark, which added well to the horror element. Paris seems aimed toward attention-deficit teenagers, though it's rated R. The lead character is too goony to be of much interest or to be taken seriously, plus he'd have been killed in his early-on rescue scene; therefore, the film doesn't even try to make the unrealistic set-up seem realistic. (You can't buy into a drama or horror film if the film doesn't strive to be true in its own world.) CGI werewolves aren't scary. London has outdated effects, of course, but they're still wonderful to watch for the audience is being treated to a painful and prolonged transformation. A real-seeming, nice guy -- not some bland goofball -- is going through something horrific, and the special effects strive for realism and therefore one can buy into the transformation, all the while knowing it's not real. Turning an actor into a cartoon werewolf is not engaging and therefore there's nothing to buy into.The ending is one one of those ha-ha wrap-things-up-in-a-bow scenes that plagued so many horror/suspense films of the 90s, such as the also-unnecessary The Vanishing, a weak remake of a gut-wrenching Dutch film.

Vince Vieluf and Phil Buckman play the two friends, one ends up attacked while the other nearly becomes a sacrifice. Julie Bowen has an amusing scene where she attempts to pitch a whistle and only succeeds in knocking her eye out. This is not nearly as good as An American Werewolf in London but the title carries a different meaning. Paris is seen as a sign of romance, which is being mocked within the hairy hysteric climax. This sequel contains a massive production values highlighted with a werewolf battle that big horror film fans will find worth the howl.

I think it is generally looked down upon. Of course, there was never any doubt that it could not live up to the original. John Landis is a master, and American Werewolf is one of the true modern classics of horror.But, to be fair, this is not all bad. It captures the 1990s rather well, and incorporates some music that was appropriate to the time (notably Bush's Mouth). And some of the themes from the first film return, in new and fun ways. Often a sequel is better off as a new film altogether, but here it is clear that being a sequel was the right move, even if it was not one that everybody wanted.

Well ahead of their time, but at the time they were originally made, the special effects technology was no where near what the story needed, to make them truly shine.An American Werewolf in London was phenomenal when it was made. It stood special effects companies on their heads, and made them change their approaches to several movies since. Because of this it will stand as a classic, that should have NEVER been remade ever. An American Werewolf in Paris, is a farce, and should be stricken for the annuls of history.

Made in 1997 a year were horror was back with the public. Scream was made one year earlier and done with stupid horrors. But Scream made a heavy foundation about going back to the use of latex and real effects. This is were this flick failed. A lot of the effects are done CGI. To go even further, it's all about the CGI effects. Of course some real effects are used too but it didn't stand it's time. There's no gore to see neither. Only the victims do have some scratches here and there. But there was another reason why I watched it again after all those years. Watching Modern Family, a comedy series I came aware of Julie Bowen and here she do act as Amy. 27 years she was here and looking sexy indeed as she still does nowadays but it shows that up till now she never did any nudity. She has a sex scene on a grave but the guy undresses Julie stays clothed. Not even a glimpse of her bra. The one who did show her boobs is French actress Julie Delpy as Serafine.I's more a love story with some funny situations, watch Julie whistling on street and see what happens. Clearly made for teens, updated with the music hyped back then (Bush remember). Ideal to watch with your teens and show them that a love story can be better then the Twilight saga.

That would be when you take a minor horror classic like An American Werewolf in London and, 16 years later, remake it as a lame action-comedy called An American Werewolf in Paris. Truly, this is the sort of flick that leaves you in awe of how good the drugs must be out in Hollywood. Getting John Landis to do a sequel to his original 4 later? Anybody could come up with that idea. How doped out of your mind do you have to be to wait another 12 years and think of doing it without Landis? How does that suggestion even get out of your mouth before someone else interrupts with That's stupid?Andy McDermott (Tom Everett Scott) is a young man who, along with his nerdy friend Brad (Vince Vieluf) and his jock buddy Chris (Phil Buckman), has embarked on a daredevil tour of Europe. Andy is the sort of guy who believes in love rather than sex, which makes him just the sort of romantic to fall for a girl who tries to kill herself by jumping off the Eiffel Tower. Andy saves her by bungee jumping after her (don't ask), only to wind up in the hospital with the one of the least medically-credible bandaged heads in cinema history. Andy and his friends track the girl down after she vanishes, only to discover that she's a werewolf and she's got some lycanthropic associates of her own, one of whom is the American-hating Claude (Pierre Cosso). Andy gets bit and becomes a werewolf, only to find that he's got to stop Claude and his gang from using a drug to transform into werewolves at will and massacring a bunch of boozed up Yanks.The first hour of so of An American Werewolf in Paris cycles through most of the same stuff as the superior first film, playing everything much more for laughs than anything else, and then the last half hour turns into some terrible buddy-cop comedy. Now dated CGI substitutes for the more shocking physical special effects of the original and the whole haunted by the spirits of the dead thing becomes a running gag. Julie Delpy does briefly take off her top, but Julie Bowen does not.The most descriptive comparison I can come up with is that, as An American Werewolf in London is to The Wolfman, An American Werewolf in Paris is to Abbot and Costello meet The Wolfman. There's about one honestly scary/unsettling scene in the entire motion picture and the rest of it is devoted to cheap jokes and dull humor, without anyone even close to as talented as either Abbot or Costello. Not that Tom Everett Scott or Julie Delpy are all that bad. They're simply stuck in an ill-conceived script helmed by a director who wants more to be funny than frightening, even though he's clearly better at the latter. By which I mean there are more moments intended to be scary that are staged effectively, but almost all of them are defanged by Anthony Waller's comedic emphasis.This movie is just not good at all.

While in Paris, Andy and friends decide to bungee jump off the Eiffel Tower, where he meets a local woman named Serafine (Julie Delpy), standing at the top of the Eiffel tower, contemplating suicide. He manages to save the young woman from her self-inflicted death, but also gets a lot more than he bargained for when he discovers that Serafine is in fact a lycanthrope (werewolf). From there, Andy gets himself mixed up in a bizarre world of a secret society of werewolves in the city, who have developed a formula that allows them to make their human-to-beast transformations whenever they please.This quirky and odd little follow-up to John Landis' horror/comedy hybrid is an essential rehash of An American Werewolf In London, but in a different European city. Granted, there are some spins on the story this time around to help keep things interesting and not too close to the film's predecessor, but when it comes down to it, this film is basically another rendition of the same type of story. The biggest twist on the story in this movie is the serum that allows the werewolves to transform at anytime, which puts our characters in much more danger. However similar this film is to London, I do have to admit that they did do a decent job re-working the script and creating a gruesome and often hilarious little horror story. It's not scary in the least, I'd probably consider it more a comedy than anything, but there is enough gruesomeness to give this the horror label. The interesting thing I suppose is how the movie begins though, because the humor is strong for the first thirty minutes or so. You may have your doubts about this being a horror film at all, but as it progresses the story does become darker, but the humor is pretty consistent throughout. There are some pretty suspenseful sequences in the last act of the film, too, and that tunnel chase in the underground was really clever and well-executed. But, I do have another gripe with this film, and that would be the special effects. All of the effects in this movie seem to be CGI, computer generated, which was a big disappointment to me, mostly because of the stunning werewolf transformations that were created in the original film with no means of computer technology. Then again, this was made when computer-generated effects are easily at hand, so I guess I can't blame them for this. It was disappointing to me though. Pretty good acting here from Tom Everett Scott, he makes a funny hero, and the lovely French actress Julie Delpy is excellent as well. Vince Vieluf plays the dead-best-friend character that Griffin Dunne perfected in Landis' film, but he plays it well enough. The ending to the film was funny too, and ended on a lighthearted note.Overall, An American Werewolf In Paris is an entertaining, fun, but above all unnecessary sequel. It provides some good entertainment, and is an amusing mix of comedy and horror, but when compared to the original movie, it doesn't amount to much. It's the kind of movie that might be enjoyed if shown at a party or something in that kind of environment, but die-hard fans of An American Werewolf In London won't see much worth bothering for in this sequel.

I haven't seen another horror-flick that this movie is sequelling (a vampire fighting flick titled BLADE), but I guess that parts of its plotline must explain how villain werewolves (they're spoofish) are threatening the good werewolf pair during a long part of the movie.  There is also a final conflict in a Paris subway train, a la SPEED.  This 1997 studio product is an odd hybrid of a film since considerable technical effects are shown for scary purposes but the authentic terrors of the original have been completely undermined, in my opinion. Such an odd re-write of the werewolf legend and movie-mythology !?!  My suggestion to those considering this at the video store -- go for a classic top of the line Thriller instead   Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO!

Did they succeed?  Certainly not.  So does that mean the film was bad?  Certainly not!  This movie isn't anything near the first one because it's nearly impossible to do something like that.  It's not just a once in a full moon occurence, it's a once in the blue moon occurence.  But the first one was so amazing that another film can be 1/2 as good as that and still be an above average horror film!  And this movie was more than 1/2 as good as the original so, there you have it.  It's not bad at all.  The special fx are better than in the original (that's a gimme).  The humor is about on par with the original.  And the budget was alot better than the original.  But as I said, this just isn't the original!  But this movie is saved brilliantly by the humor.  It is such a funny movie!  It is amongst the most humorous horror movies within the last 5 years.  And it's not corny, unoriginal humor.  You have simply not seen this humor before!  It's slick and it's memorable.  I easily think this earns a spot within the top 10 werewolf movies ever made.  That says alot for a sequel, mind you.

None of the characters from the previous movie return and aren't even mentioned in this movie by name.

It's one of the better werewolf films I have seen in a long time too. And I have seen quite my share, such as An American werewolf in London, The Howling, Wolfen, The Wolfman and the Underworld trilogy.The story tells of three Americans visiting Paris on a vacation. At the top of the Eifel Tower one of them saves a woman trying to commit suicide. What starts out as a romantic relationship slowly turns into a nightmare when the dark secrets that lurk in the city are revealed...I really liked the acting in this film. Especially the two stars of the movie the woman who tried to commit suicide and the guy who saves her. They have good chemistry together. But the other two Americans also play their roles nicely. I didn't really find anything annoying about the acting, so thumbs up for that! The effects on the werewolves are nice. It doesn't look too cheap or fake to me. Of course, the opinions are divided about this subject. But let's just say that I wasn't disappointed.There's also a good amount of humor in this movie. There are some really funny scenes you will probably remember for a long time.So, to sum it up, An American werewolf in Paris might not be a direct sequel to it's predecessor, but it's still an enjoyable movie.

Delpy, who I adore thanks in part to her BEFORE SUNRISE / SUNSET movies, is as beautiful as ever, and I certainly understand why Everett Scott's character would become enchanted by her, but her Serafine doesn't have much to do..this is Everett Scott's movie and he's a goofy hero with a rubbery face. This film expands upon the idea from the first movie regarding those cursed with lycanthropy being able to see those killed by werewolves, their spirits forced to roam free as long as those who caused their death remain alive. A yummy victim of Andy's, Amy(Julie Bowen)is a source of ghoulish comedy that borders on parody and features groan-inducing zombie gags when she attempts to inform the other werewolves of her murderer's whereabouts or chastises him for his responsibility in her demise. The film never creates a form of terror due to it's consistently comedic tone and the werewolves themselves are simply disappointing. The lycanthropic source for why these werewolves exist is also limply presented, and the happy Hollywood ending puts the icing on the cake..unlike the grim conclusion of Landis' film, you never are led to believe that Andy and Serafine aren't meant to be together, and that predictability weighs heavy on the suspense that's supposed to exist and doesn't.The film is basically just Andy avoiding the police and the French werewolves while holding on to his love affair with Serafine, and the eventual showdown with the lycanthropes at the end. All is not lost, you get to see Delpy's tits for a moment or two in a bizarre scene where Serafine gets on top of Andy, attempting to inform him of his curse of lycanthropy, while subduing him.

It is kind of like Hostel as it features a group of back packing hippies travelling through Asia in search of drugs and womens.The friends go to a club and fail to notice the strange hyropoctical symbols on the doors and walls.

Before she can commit her act, Andy saves her by bungee jumping off the tower to save her from falling to her death knocking himself unconscious in the process. After being let out of the hospital Andy & his buds attempt to track her down. Upon finding her home, they are invited by her friend to an underground night club, while there Andy & his buddies are attacked by werewolves, with his pal Brad being horribly mutilated, while his other friend is abducted & taken back to Serafaine's home & locked in a cage where he attempts to escape. Andy is bitten in the process & soon learns from the disembodied spirit of his dead friend Brad that he will transform into a werewolf unless he kills himself before the next full moon. Andy then sets out to find another way to save Serafaine & himself from the werewolf curse & stop Serafaine's friend & his band of followers from mutilating more victims or worse, turning more innocent people into werewolves. Despite the title, An American Werewolf In Paris has no real connections to the original film whatsoever, minus the werewolves, the disembodied, mangled spirits that visit their killers & the title, the film is a complete in name only sequel, in fact none of the original cast or crew or characters return & none of the events of the original are ever mentioned here either. On the downside, An American Werewolf In Paris much like most sequels done to films that never asked for sequels, is nowhere near as good as the original film, despite a much improved budget ($22 million!), An American Werewolf In Paris lacks the scares, comedy, suspense, tension & atmosphere of the original, while the comedy here is pretty funny at times, most of the jokes & humour are rather juvenile & many of the scares falls flat due to poor build up. The CGI werewolves while impressive for what they are, are nowhere near as good as Rick Bakers hairy beast monstrosity from the first film. While the first film had the perfect blend of horror & comedy, An American Werewolf In Paris is seemingly unable to pull off the same feat, at times the comedy undercuts the horror, robbing the film of the impact it could have had, had the horror & comedy been balanced well.On the plus side, while An American Werewolf Paris is nowhere near as good as the first, it still has a lot going for it, in particular with the direction of the film, director ANDY WALLER does fairly well behind the camera (He also serves as writer & Executive Producer) managing to capture all the werewolf carnage at all the right angles & manages to soak up the scenery of Paris. The acting is really good here with each actor making their character that much more fun & interesting. The film also delights itself in some funny on target jabs at the french culture as well, which I found to be quiet enjoyable. The score is also really good & the film does have a few scary moments of suspense on hand, in particular in the scene set in the basement where we see one of Andy's buddies trying to escape from a legless werewolf that is pursuing him, only for him to try & escape out a door which when opens only leads into a closet! All in all, An American Werewolf In Paris while far from being a great horror movie is still plenty of fun for fans & has many fine moments to help elevate it above most unnecessary sequels. If you're ever in the mood for just a fun time waster & not much more you should enjoy it.*** stars "},{"Title":"No match for the first one,but on it's own a good werewolf flick with some good ideas","Date":"23 April 2005","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" An American Werewolf In London was a hard act to follow,and this sequel came 15 years after it.

Three young back packers take a fancy to a beautiful Parisian girl.  How were they to know she was a werewolf?

And the only escape from this awful dilemma is to kill the brute that bit you.Like me you will probably get a little bit lost in the life cycle of a werewolf.  You will find it hard to remember which werewolf is the offending monster.  There is mayhem in the underground passage ways with werewolves leaping in all directions. Horror reigns amid the bloodied body parts that are strewn around.The film is well executed with a sufficiently fast pace that allows us no time to realise how stupid the situations are.  The computer - generated animals are much larger than I imagined a werewolf would be, but their size only adds to the excitement.  And because we only see them leaping and snarling for a few seconds at a time,we accept them as true flesh and blood animals.  The photography and effects are top class.Somehow or other the leads in the film manage to escape with their lives.  The end of the film introduces a contradiction of ideas.  It seems that medical science will come to the rescue to save them from their werewolf existence, whereas earlier it was stated that only a dagger throught the heart of the werewolf could save the victim.

Three young American daredevils share cliché dialogue on a train talking about having sex versus being in love, with none of these performances ringing true. Then when visiting the Eiffel Tower they see a French girl jump- and our protagonist jumps after her with a rope. The implausible leap of faith is repeated at the end with the Statue of Liberty, sort of an embarrassing attempt to be cool and thrilling. And- surprise, surprise- the girl is a wolf.Some of the best concepts of the movie are simply taken from the original film- like undead victims coming back to haunt the werewolf. Here one of them is Julie Bowen, who currently stars in Modern Family. Bowen plays a trashy girl who comes back as a bloody mess and then is forgotten by the movie's end. The scene where she tries whistling and blood and one of her eyes come out is more gruesome than darkly funny. For that matter, nothing in this movie made me laugh.One thing that really confused me was the scene where the protagonist is in bed and the French woman removes her top. There appears to be at least one dream within a dream, but then things said in a dream turn out to be real. What's going on here?

Now, apparently director Anthony Waller has decided to try to cash in on that film's long ago success, resulting in a slightly amusing but altogether disappointing werewolf romp. Tom Everett Scott stars as Andy, our hero, who is a childish all-American college boy on a European sex tour with a couple of his friends. Interesting that they are keeping score of their sexual exploits, but decide to drop everything in order to help Andy pursue this mildly attractive blonde who they three met as she attempted suicide. Sounds like a keeper. The three guys are illegally camping on the Eiffel Tower one night when they happen across the girl about to jump, while luckily Andy had just been strapping on a bungee cord for his daredevil (i.e. suicide) stunt, bungee jumping off the Eiffel Tower. Anyone with two brain cells working at the same time would realize instantly that no one could ever survive bungee jumping off the Eiffel Tower, so it's a good thing that Andy at least winds up in the hospital. After a laughable rescue, thankfully it's followed by a genuinely effective laugh, and thus is the tone set for the rest of the movie.Unfortunately, they didn't know where to relax with the comedy and where to make the horror affective (note it never is). In the supplemental documentaries included on the DVD, they say that this is the most ambitious werewolf film ever made, which may very well be true, although the story is ridiculous, the cast is just a little too goofy (imagine filling an ambitious werewolf film with the cast of Parker Lewis Can't Lose, and you'll have something pretty close to what's going on here), and the CGI, trumpeted as one of the film's proudest ingredients, is never convincing for a second. Just further evidence of my theory that no CGI effect has ever been made scary in film history. The werewolf emerging from the fountain and shaking off is indeed impressive, but still sadly does not look remotely real.Then again, the movie was made more than a decade ago, so maybe that was pretty impressive by 1997 standards. But for all of the stock put into the special effects, I was surprised to see that they made such a blunderous mistake during one of the transformation scenes. There is a groan inducing scene where a human transforms into a werewolf, and as we travel down the body we see it grow thicker and hairier and whatnot, and then the knees apparently snap and bend backwards as the body takes on the pose of a wolf. What the CGI team seems to have forgotten is that wolves have knees just like humans. The knee that was formed during this scene is actually the wolf's ankle. Haven't these people ever seen a dog before?But for all of it's shortcomings (and there are a great many), at least the film has a fair amount of effective comic relief. Most of which, however, is only in the first half, and the movie takes a precipitous decline after about the first 45 minutes. Note the film crew were allowed astonishing access to film at the Eiffel Tower, which leads me to wonder what the French government thought about that decision when they finally saw the movie&#133; "},{"Title":"So what?","Date":"13 June 2006","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" So a few lines may have been hackneyed, a few situations clichéd, a few lines kitsch.

Julie Bowen and especially Julie Delpy are a welcome presence and give good performances. For me all the other performances were bland. Also it does begin well, but sadly that's about it.Anthony Waller's direction is uninspired, with the exception of some decent shots something is lost in translation and I can't point my finger on it at the moment.

The story is messy and lacks the fairy-tale quality of An American Werewolf in London, the soundtrack doesn't fit with the movie at all and the script is pretty dire complete with sluggish pacing and characters that I didn't care anything for apart from Delpy's perhaps.

The difficult part is knowing the mindset of the individual reviewer.An American Werewolf in London is trash.  I checked the other reviews of one of the posters who liked the movie to see what else he liked.  He called Roadhouse (Patrick Swayze as a philosopher/Bouncer) a must-see.  Knowing that this person thought Roadhouse was a must-see helps to put his positive review of American Werewolf In London in perspective.Start with the acting.  I was surprised to learn that these actors had established careers (My co-worker insists this is a good cast).  The 3 male leads are so BAD it hurt.  Granted this could be the fault of the script.  Julie Delpy was okay; meaning she didn't hurt my head.When will filmmakers learn that 95% of all CGI looks horrible?  The CGI in this film is about as convincing as the snake in Anaconda.  Cartoon is an understatement.  If you are frightened by computer graphics chasing humans then this is the movie for you!  There was a reviewer who thought the effects in this film surpassed the first.  I don't see how an obvious contrived computer graphic can be called better.  Let's call it more 'modern.'  It just shows that having access to modern equipment does not mean you'll have better effects. While there are certain themes/ideas that are borrowed from the first film, I would not call it a sequel.  To call it a sequel would imply there was a connection between the characters and events in the two films.  Its more like a rip-off of the first film (with a dash of the movie Blade) directed by a hack.  There are a hodge-podge of ideas all thrown into a blender before any of them develop into anything good.Finally, I should say that I sometimes watch bad movies for fun.

I really can't see why everyone hated it.  I guess its the kind of people who saw the original when it first came out, and think this movie is just a poor excuse at trying to remake the original.  But guess what IT ISN'T.  So, if your a big fan of American Werewolf in London, then don't watch A.A.W.I.P. thinking its just a spoof.  It has a lot of more action, humor, and better effect than A.A.W.I.L.  And lets also not forget this isn't a sequel.  It's a totally different movie.  So try to stop picking it totally apart, and comparing it to the 80's movie.  My vote is a 10/10, and my vote for A.A.W.I.L. is 2/10, only because David Naughton was in it.

When they get to Paris, they hide in the Eiffel Tower until after hours, then climb the stairs up to the observation deck--Andy McDermott (Tom Everett Scott) plans to bungee jump from the platform. While preparing for the leap, a mysterious, beautiful woman, Serafine Pigot (Julie Delpy) suddenly appears. She climbs to the top of the guard railing, and attempts to commit suicide. McDermott saves her, then pursues her. But she may not be what she appeared to be, and the three friends' lives may be at stake.While this is often thought of as a sequel to An American Werewolf in London (1981), it's really more of a re-imagining of similar material. So it's not necessarily to watch London first. While many viewers' opinions on the two films may be colored by which film they see first and/or which they are more familiar with, I think both films are excellent. This earns a 10 out of 10 from me just as easily as London did.Paris works so superbly for a similar reason to London. Writer/director Anthony Waller, along with writers Tim Burns and Tom Stern, has created a seamless melding of comedy and horror. Each genre is fully committed to, and each amplifies the other. There is a different taste to the mixture, making it easily fit into its era (just as London has a late 70s/early 80s flavor). The humor here more straightforward, and maybe a little more outrageous, while the horror tends to be more fast-paced, epic in scale, and the major effects are achieved through cgi rather than mechanicals. Whether you prefer one or the other, if you do, will probably depend on whether your tastes lie more with the horror films of one era or the other. I like both eras equally, leading to my liking both films (although I have to say that I slightly prefer London, as that's long been one of my favorite films, and for me, you just can't beat the ending).The plot of Paris is captivating, fairly complex, often suspenseful, and there is even an extensive subplot about a gang of Nazi-like skinheads practicing eugenics in their own peculiar way. Pigot is very well-developed, with an intriguing backstory that would make for a good prequel. The cast is almost as good as the cast of London (with Delpy being just as good as anyone in the first film), the film looks good, and the locations are beautiful (although none have quite the eeriness of London's settings). It is also well edited, well directed, and has a nice metal-oriented soundtrack.

The acting is far below-par (Ton Scott is a good actor, but I dont know what the hell happened) all the Americans come off as incredibly annoying and anal, the SFX, while OK, dont reach the glorious Physical pitch reached 20 years ago, the story is just uninteresting, and overall, even as a first off it doesnt cut it, and is impossible to not compare it to its predeccesor.I give it 4/10, if only for the beautiful Julie Delpy.

Basically the story is about nothing and it never is really going somewhere because of its incoherent feeling it has. Basically this movie is subplot after subplot without really one main focus. I think this is also due to the fact that the main character is not really interesting or likable enough.Also the movie is seriously lacking in style. It has an awful 'made-for-tv' kind of look, completely with the standard camera-work and editing.Still the humor makes this movie somewhat fun to watch but it simply ain't enough to prevent this movie from being an disappointing and bad late sequel to the 1981 movie An American Werewolf in London directed by the obviously more talented director John Landis. The story is set in Paris but somehow for some reason the makers didn't really took advantage of this. The movie doesn't even look like it was made in Paris and I think I'm probably right to think so, considering that this movie filming locations also include Amsterdam, Luxembourgh and Metz. Probably the only sequences filmed in Paris were the ones with the Eiffel tower. Probably the obviously low budget was the reason for this but still it remains a missed opportunity to try and give this movie some more atmosphere and style.The movie does deserve credit for the werewolf scene's. Its obvious were they spend most of the budget on. The transformation sequences are nicely done and the early CGI for the werewolf's is also pretty nicely done, especially when considering that his movie was made back in 1997. Sure, it looks outdated at times but still it surprised and impressed me how advanced the effects looked at times.Watchable? Just maybe slightly. The humor is enjoyable at times but the movie seriously lacks a good script and characters. If you like werewolf movies this maybe still be a worthy movie to watch for you.4/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"I don't know what kind of friend this jerk is to you but he ate my spleen.

They hide in the Tower & when the coast is clear Andy rigs his bungee cord up but as he is about to jump he hears footsteps belonging to a attractive young woman named Serafine (Julie Delpy). Serafine also wants to jump off the Tower but for a different reason to Andy, to commit suicide. Serafine jumps & Andy throws himself after her & manages to catch up with her on the way down, grab her & deposit her on the ground without leaving a single scratch on her while he recoils back & knocks himself out on a beam. When he comes round Andy is determined to find her which doesn't take long as she just happens to be a nurse at the very same hospital he has been taken too, gee what a coincidence. Andy pesters her for a date to which Serafine eventually agrees, Andy quickly falls in love with her & when one of her friends Claude (Pierre Cosso) says Serafine will be at a club that night the three friends go. However Andy soon discovers that Serafine is a Werewolf & her friends are Werewolves, Andy is drawn into a underground world of Werewolves & a sinister plan to overthrow mankind using a serum which lets those infected turn into a Werewolf at any time...Executive produced, co-written & directed by Anthony Waller I think An American Werewolf in Paris fails miserably at just about everything that it sets out to achieve. The script by Waller, Tim Burns & Tom Stern tries to be many things & ends up as a complete mess. First it tries hard to be a comedy with lots of stupid inappropriate slapstick that isn't funny in the slightest, Andy knocking himself out on a beam, a Doctor emerging from a room knocking Andy to the ground, a zombie trying to whistle & their eyeball popping out, a bumbling cop & a scene in a café where Andy blows a condom up in front of Serafine because it's supposed to be bubble gum. It also tries to mix in horror elements with the Werewolves, massacre of American teenagers, rotting undead zombies, human hearts in blenders & mad scientist serums. There are also brief snippets of action in here as well with a psychically impossible bungee jump from the Eiffel Tower, a few shoot outs, plenty of hand to hand fights & a chase through a train. An American Werewolf in Paris fails to combine these genres effectively, everything feels out of place, very awkward & odd especially if you have seen the brilliant original An American Werewolf in London (1981) which is vastly superior to this in every possible way. I was never quite sure what I was supposed to be watching, whether I was supposed to be laughing, screaming or on the edge of my seat & in the end I did none of these things at any point. An American Werewolf in Paris moves along at a fair pace & at it's most basic provides sporadic glimmers of entertainment but not packaged into one coherent film. The characters are dumb & unlikable, the words stereotype & clichéd come to mind. One more thing is it true that everyone in Paris speaks English but with a French accent? With a budget of about $22,000,000 An American Werewolf in Paris is technically OK but the special effects aren't the best & the Werewolves themselves look like the fake CGI computer graphics that they so obviously are, Rick Baker's Oscar winning animatronic & puppet effects in the original look far better even with a 17 year gap in special effects development between the two films. The gore is tame by comparison to the original as well, just a few severed limbs, a few boring Werewolf attacks & a couple of rotting zombies, yawn. A word about the music which I hated, full of rock & rave type crap director Waller once again tries to pander to the teenage audience along with he casting of handsome teenage leads who can't act. Because An American Werewolf in Paris flirts between lame comedy & lame horror it fails to build any sort of rhythm or atmosphere either way & almost comes across two different films pasted together, by a chimpanzee. Forget about this pile of crap & watch the original again instead & remember how great a film that is. Definitely one to avoid.

Was it because of Julie Delpy who has been in some of the finest films of all time? (The Three Colors and Godard's King Lear, Sunset.) Those are miraculous films, worth seeing over and over, but her role in them is so minor it seems accidental.Was it because of a remark I made about Paris being an apt stage for the vampire theater of 'Interview with a Vampire?'? Couldn't be. This is not meant to be an intelligent vampire film like, say 'The Forsaken.' In vain have I scoured my notes and my memory of the experience for any reason someone should watch this. It is not stylish like 'Brides of Dracula' nor self-aware like 'Shadow of the Vampire.'Vampire films (and this is a vampire movie, just using another costume) are always at least about other vampire films, and sex is unavoidable. But there's such a wild-eyed innocence about this project it takes all the danger out of it. There's one pretty interesting scene that almost redeems it. That scene is the wedding at the end which will be spoiled for you if I describe it. So I won't but it is pretty cinematic. Skip over the rest of the film and go directly to it.(later) I think I know why this was on the list. Delpy IS supposed to be someone intelligent. Her 'Tell Me' is pretty folded, and this fell onto the list by association. Ted's evaluation 1 of 4 -- You can probably find something better to do with this part of your life.

Soon he too is a werewolf and they must fight off other werewolves in this incredibly silly film. I still remember going to see this thing on opening day and I still remember the sold out crowd booing at the end. This really doesn't have any connections to AN American WEREWOLF IN London outside this being nothing more than a remake but I even have a hard time calling it a remake because for the most part this film comes off as a romantic comedy about an American in Paris trying to get over his nerves to get the girl he likes. All of the werewolf stuff seems forced and it often times takes a back seat to some incredibly stupid comic bits. For the life of me I'll never understand why they went for as much comedy as they did. Not that I mind that because London worked both sides of the coin perfectly well and I think you can watch this film and see why the Landis movie is such a masterpiece because it was able to pull this off. This film, however, doesn't manage to get anything right and in the end it's just a boring mess with a lot more negative things than positive. The one positive thing is Delpy who turns in a nice performance even though you can't help but think she's way too good for this material. Scott, just off THAT THING YOU DO!, comes off with a decent performance but the screenplay really doesn't do him any justice. The rest of the supporting players get lost in all the mess and none of them get much to do. The biggest problem are the horrible CGI effects that are so cheap looking that many of them take place off camera. The effects we do see are incredibly bad, cheap and laughable.

This little and insignificant production only borrows the classy title and shamelessly recycles the most successful comedy gimmicks for its own benefit, like the restless victims returning in gradually worse states of decomposition. Otherwise this film has no originality of its own, the werewolf transformations and make-up effects are weak (and actually look more dated already than the ones of the early 80's film) and particularly the portrayal of the French population is frustratingly stereotypic. All local characters, perhaps with the exception of the beautifully cherubic Julie Delpy, are aggressive and loud-mouthed troublemakers that detest foreigners and physically appear to be Nazis. The plot revolves on three American students touring around Europe and pulling reckless stunts for kicks. Andy is about to bungee-jump from the Eiffel Tower when he notices a beautiful girl with the intention to commit suicide. He saves her and becomes obsessed with her, but the poor girl has a big burden to carry. She and her friends are vampires and organize underground parties to lure victims. An American Werewolf in Paris is a horror-comedy but suffers from two major essential defects it's NOT scary and it's NOT funny. The scenes where Andy chases his blond muse around Paris occasionally evoke some harmless chuckles, but particularly the interactions with the rotting corpses are embarrassingly UN-funny. Considering the type of film this is, I was quite surprised to see Anthony Waller's name listed as the director. We only know him from Mute Witness, which is a supremely tense and ultra-macabre thriller dealing with topics like Russian snuff-movies. I nevertheless want to finish on a positive note, namely by praising the superior females in this inferior film.

They don't have any security? Look at it as a piece of silly self-referential satire - nothing more.
