[{"Title":"Memorable Performances For Intense Drama","Date":"1 May 2005","Score":"19 out of 19 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Music","Review":" Celebrity bio-pics are very hit or miss, but once in a great while a really good one comes along--and WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT is one of them. Based on the autobiography of Tina Turner, the film offers a glossy but intense portrait of her rapid rise to stardom under the sponsorship of husband-manager Ike Turner--a relationship that quickly turned dark and became increasingly abusive as Tina's fame began to outstrip Ike's own.Although the film is a bit on the obvious side, it is well-crafted and the two leads offer powerhouse performances. Angela Bassett is simply astonishing as Tina Turner; where most other actresses might have simply imitated, Bassett accomplishes the impossible she makes you believe that she is Tina Turner, capturing both Tina's famous on-stage performing style (the concert scenes are really exciting) and giving a completely believable interpretation of her off-stage personality as well. The script offers Laurence Fishburne little more than a one-dimensional role, but he plays it brilliantly from start to finish, and both are well supported by the overall cast.There is certainly a great deal more to the lives of both Ike and Tina Turner than this film conveys--but what it does show it presents with considerable power and conviction, and by the time Tina finally hits back at Ike you'll be roaring for her to hit him again--and again--and again--and eager to see her finally triumph entirely on her own.

Directed by the late Brian Gibson in an appropriately feverish manner, the 1993 movie still burns brightly thanks to the electrifying performances of Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne. There have been several fine performances in biopics of late - Jamie Foxx in Ray, Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon in Walk the Line - but I still feel Bassett and Fishburne maintain the high watermark as they seem to inhabit the roles of Ike and Tina completely in this film.Adapting probably the most melodramatic parts of Tina's book, Gibson and screenwriter Kate Lanier built a dramatic framework about the former Anna Mae Bullock that is somewhat standard-issue and probably biased, but it works on a visceral level as a story of personal triumph punctuated by some of the most gut-wrenching scenes of domestic violence captured on film. Playing one of the most recognizable and enduring celebrities in the rock world, Bassett manages to capture the physical mannerisms, vocal patterns, and onstage energy of the real Tina, even though her voice obviously had to be dubbed. With her almost distracting musculature, she convincingly rips into all her musical performances with unabated fire, but it's really in her dramatic scenes, especially when she becomes an increasingly degraded victim of her husband's demons, that she soars. Fishburne has an extremely tough role, as he has to transcend the inherent villainy of Ike by displaying the bravado and talent that brought the pair the spotlight in the early years. He brilliantly manages to imbue a spirit that is at once frightening and pitiable.With a relatively sparse filmography, Gibson provides surprisingly sturdy direction here, often using an effective faux-combination of grainy home movies and TV programs to make the movie feel like a Behind the Scenes rock documentary. I particularly liked how he edited the inevitable Proud Mary - complete with gyrating Ikettes and Tina in her classic cave woman mini - to show the passage of time between the late sixties to the mid-seventies. Unsurprisingly, no one else makes nearly the impression of the two stars, though Jenifer Lewis has a few funny moments as Tina's mother Zelma, and Vanessa Bell Calloway does what she can in her switch from hard-bitten back-up singer to becalming Buddhist. Regardless, see it for two actors - sadly underutilized since this movie was released, the wondrous Bassett in particular - giving all they have into this memorable movie. The DVD has no significant extras other than the original trailer.

It accurately and convincingly depicts the abuse she underwent and her escape and, finally, salvation through Buddhism.  Laurence Fishburne is one of this generation great actors and gives a riveting and observant performance as Ike Turner, but cannot come close to the overwhelming, breathtaking, and mighty presence of Angela Bassett as Tina.  She deservedly won the Golden Globe as the Best Actress in a Comedy/Musical of 1993 and if the film had come out any other year than 1993 (during which Holly Hunter gave a performance of a lifetime in The Piano), she would have easily taken home an Oscar.Music plays a huge part in the film and all of it is good.  Though I'm only 12, I truly appreciate Tina's music and am always in awe when she sings Proud Mary (one of my favorite scenes in the film.)  As Roger Ebert pointed out, one of the most triumphant scenes is where, after Tina and Ike have had a vicious and bloody fight, Tina runs away to the Ramada Inn where they take her in.  It is one of the best acted scenes of this decade and I never tire of it when I see the film again.What's Love Got to Do With It is one of the best films of 1993 (one of the greatest movie years in history- Schindler's List, The Piano) and one the most passionately and skillfully performed films of the decade.**** out of **** (A) "},{"Title":"Much better than I expected","Date":"21 February 2003","Score":"14 out of 23 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Music","Review":"  As a young girl, Anna Mae Bullock is left behind when her mother flees an abusive husband.  As a young woman she comes to the city to rejoin her mother and sister.  Going with her sister to a local club, Anna Mae is drawn onto the stage by band leader Ike Turner and reveals a powerful voice.  He takes her into his band and the two go onto success, marriage and children with Anna Mae taking the stage name Tina Turner.  However beneath the surface, Ike is a violent man and Tina is forced to either defend him or escape.I have seen this twice already, although I'm not a Tina Turner fan and don't find her music to be that good (aside from a few of the bigger hits) but I do know a powerful film when I see it.  The plot is based on the biography of Tina Turner and, because it is official, the end result is that it lacks an eye that approaches with fair judgement.  The film therefore builds up the strength of Ike and the resolve of Tina and is a little too reverent at points like Tina finding strength in Buddhist chanting.  However it is difficult to miss the cynical eye when you accept that having a violent husband and being trapped is a difficult situation that anyone does well to come out of.The film is moving but never lets itself become overly emotional or sentimental.  Instead it just soldiers on like Tina herself and the final scenes give you an impression of someone who has overcome to get to where she is.  Usually it would be difficult to feel for someone who is as rich and successful as Tina Turner and it is to the film's credit that it has managed it.  Part of the reason for this is a sympathetic yet strong performance from Bassett (one of the better black actresses around).  She at times seems to be just impersonating Turner (during the music pieces) but she is in her element in the rest with a meaty part not often offered to her.  Fishburne is good and bad in different ways. Firstly he is good because he grips the audience and commands attention and is, as always, an excellent actor given the chance.  However he is too powerful &#150; the real Ike is less physically dominant and Fishburne doesn't do him justice &#150; appearing to point the blame on drugs and no inner turmoil.Overall this is a good film that deals with a difficult subject matter.  The fact that it is a true story just makes it better.  Strong black leads and emotionally involving makes for a good watch even if it's hard to describe the violence at times as `entertainment'.

Perhaps the only movie with more domestic violence than *Mommie Dearest*, this is the movie bio to end all movie bios. From the earliest scenes of a rambunctious Tina (or Anna Mae, as she was known then) acting up during choir practice, we, the audience, belong to her completely, irrevocably winning us through empathy and admiration for such a feisty, plucky spirit. Showing Ike as a famous R&B star and suave ladykiller at the time he meets the young Tina, Ike wins her through a combination of persistence and flattery, appealing to her vanity and sense of loyalty (I make them famous and then they run off, Ike tells her). But they team up and, as we know, and make musical history. Their codependency is of the direst sort &#150; he *made* her and feels like he owns her, and she just wants to please him. But pleasing Ike is a tall order, and any success is only temporary. We are taken on a wild ride of spectacular performances in vivid color &#150; both the great achievements of the duo, as well as their darkest hours, but as Ike slides into drugs and domination, the situation is as hopeless as most codependent situations are. We see Tina as she is, once again, beaten to a pulp&#133;but perhaps for the last time. She runs away, and with a wrenching scene in which she appears in the lobby of the neighboring Ramada Inn, begging for shelter, we are begging with her, praying for some nameless act of charity to deliver her from evil. She makes a relatively clean getaway, winding up in the hands of Roger Davies, her manager (and a producer of this film), who engineered one of the greatest comebacks in history. Of course, Ike tries desperately and unsuccessfully to woo her back, telling her how he *made* her, but then becomes ridiculous, uttering to her in 1980, You ain't no Donna Summers. But we know what the outcome of that is &#150; Tina's personal success and lifetime appointment as posterchild for Survivors Anonymous is legendary. Angela Bassett is one of the finest actresses alive, but has yet to produce anything rivaling this performance. She is backed up by a number of extremely strong performances, especially that of Vanessa Bell, in a stand-up performance as her friend Jackie, who not only proves to Tina that she can escape from Ike, but also shows her a way to inner-peace through Buddhism. During the closing credits, we see the real-life Tina perform the title song, but it is a gratuitous, and even negligent performance, that undermines the audience's belief in Basset as Tina. The crime is that this film did not receive Academy attention &#150; for art direction and costuming alone, it is the exquisite evocation of an extremely lively era and lifestyle &#150; as an almost perfect production, it meshes together the cinematography, script, acting and music into a dazzling and sometimes horrifying, but always riveting tour de force.

The film tells the story of Tina Turner's childhood as Anna Mae Bullock her move to St. Louis after her grandmother's death to live with her mother, her meeting Ike Turner at a nightclub, her subsequent singing with Ike's band, their marriage and divorce.By necessity, biopics have to leave out people and incidents, often combining several incidents into one or skipping several steps. In no way does a knowledge of Tina Turner''s life detract from the impact of this film. It's a story of a woman's determination, beating the odds, suffering, perseverance and ultimate success.Ike's and Tina's marriage was pretty much a horror show. Ike was always controlling, to the detriment of his own career, and as he turned to drugs, his abuse of Tina escalated. The most stunning scene in the film (besides the performances, which are fantastic) occurs when the couple fights in a limo en route to a hotel. Ike becomes physical; Tina has discovered Buddhism and finally gets the courage to fight back. A bloody mess, she runs away from him with only 36 cents in her purse.Angela Bassett gives a searing, electrifying performance as Turner. Her sinewy body is a great match for Turner's, and she uses it to perfection in replicating Turner's performances (Turner's voice is used on the soundtrack). She shows the star's vulnerability, fear, and internal strength throughout.Bassett is matched by Laurence Fishburne's terrifying performance as Ike. Fishburne seethes with manipulation and anger, even in scenes where he's being nice. When Ike loses his temper, you can see how he can't stop and the violence just gets worth. A brilliant performance.A must see. The latter part of Turner's life is not explored, but while she always remained popular in Europe, it was a long time before she could get a recording contract here after some failed recordings. Today she remains one of the greatest singing stars ever. But there were lots of valleys in between.

While the performances are spot-on, brave and intense, and the original tunes frequently sound incredible, the facts and details of Anna Mae Bullock's relationship with R&B shaker Ike Turner remain hazy and suspect. Certain set-pieces, like Tina's recording session with Phil Spector, look marvelous but serve no particular purpose (and the film lets us think Ike had no involvement in a group-project that resulted in a full album, not just a single release). Angela Bassett is undoubtedly just the perfect choice to portray the exciting Tina Turner, but what of Turner's own tumultuous personality? The movie's narrative gives all the fire and anger to husband Ike, despite Tina's burgeoning muscular arms (she didn't get those muscles from Buddhist chanting!). Also lost are the solo years between leaving Ike and finding success on the pop charts in 1984. The film hopes to wrap things up with a little unnecessary melodrama, but just fouls itself up trying to make a (tired) point about finding one's inner peace and independence. The look of the film is quite remarkable throughout, and the early sequences are entertainingly staged, but very little of the film's final third rings true or comes to close to matching what music-historians know to be accurate. **1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"Sizzle and Rock","Date":"1 March 2014","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Music","Review":" This film portrayed the experience of Tina Turner,one of Rock and Roll's popular artists.I love Bassett,and feel the tense drama of Tina's struggle with finding herself.Tina had to deal with Ike(Fishbourne) bullying,taking over her dignity and self-respect.It is through the film,fans see the strength Tina possessed.Like a robot,Tina took orders and tried to satisfy Ike's whims.

The film is brilliantly directed by the late Brian Gibson, whose previous film in 1991 had been the life story of another famous black singer, Josephine Baker. But the film sizzles and fascinates primarily because of the sensational performance of Angela Bassett as Tina Turner. She is simply a knock-out. I presume her singing may have been dubbed by Turner herself. But whether she sang or not, her performance was dazzling, full of charm and sweetness as well as conveying all the heartache, emotional confusion and weakness, joys and sorrows. This is really a superior biopic, and the true story has plenty to tell! One should not neglect to mention that the little girl who plays Tina as a child, Rae'Ven Larrymore Kelly, is also superb. (She has grown up and appeared now in 42 films.) Tina Turner had a rough time in life, and it is shown very vividly in this film. She married an egocentric, violent, borderline psychopath named Ike Turner (died 2007), who beat her up regularly for years. Men who beat up women are really sick, but women who let men beat them up year in and year out without leaving them are sick too. In the film her excuse for not leaving Ike is said to be because she 'can't abandon family', due to the trauma of her horrible mother having abandoned her as a child. That does not wash. But let us not heap blame upon the ravaged Tina Turner for the horrors she endured and for her determination over so many years to remain a victim rather than save herself. At last she did summon up the courage to save herself, and she also went on to reinvent herself. So this is a story of heroic endurance and dedication to her art by a girl who was born to sing. If she suffered a lot along the way, well, that's life. But the songs go on.

The movie begins with Tina (Anna Mae Bullock, her original name, as she was known then) as a sweet little girl, who acts up in church singing with the choir by not singing the song Bright Light appropriately. The lady conducting the choir stops the music, warns her to stop, and then escorts the girl out of the church just seconds later for not listening. Jenifer Lewis was excellent playing Tina's mother, and she was fabulous as well. She then meets Ike in the late 50s, and, at first, he treats her kindly, but after a while, he is very mean and abusive to her (there are several scenes of such content in this movie that are so horrible to see. In these instances, you automatically feel sadness for Tina and intense anger at Ike; how dare he lay a violent hand on her!) You see for yourself that Ike was NOT a good husband to Tina; in other words, he was a real (you know what), and she did not do or say anything to deserve being beaten and bullied by Ike. She WAS singing the songs properly, but Ike didn't listen. There was one scene where she tries to take the kids and sneak out, but unfortunately, Ike catches up with her the next day, and her plan to get away is dashed. There were several instances that Tina got back at him the scene where they and a friend of Tina's, Jackie, were at the cafeteria and Ike forced her to eat some cake by forcing it in her mouth, and she threw her drink in Ike's face (Wow!! What a way to make him back off!), but Ike had hit Jackie, she told him to kiss her (you know what) and bolted out. The next fight back scene was when Ike and Tina were in the plane and he kept leaning on her, she got up to get away from him and told him to Go straight to hell, Ike!, and in the limo where she hit him back after he hit her in the car. Whooo! She wasn't going to put up with him anymore!! Ike had had some problems with drugs and possibly alcoholism during the marriage (the addictions made him abusive to her, I assume) and Tina should have gotten rid of him sooner, but after a while, she sued for divorce and got rid of him FINALLY!!! Way to go, Tina!! It is quite obvious that you had taken enough of his abuse. The music in this movie is great to listen to (I have the soundtrack album of the same name on CD). Songs like I Don't Wanna Fight, Nutbush City Limits (that's a funny one), the title track is great as well, A Fool In Love, and their version of Creedence Clearwater Revival's Proud Mary is great also, with Tina speaking the intro describing to the folks listening how it is being done. Creedence's version of the song is great to listen to, as it is a soft rock version, while Ike and Tina's version contains a nice and jumpy groove to it (with horns added) to almost want to make you want to dance. I am a fan of Tina's, even though the songs on the soundtrack are the only ones of hers I like. I never read the book, I, Tina, but this movie is good to watch. I highly recommend watching this movie.

It doesn't matter that Bassett does not physically resemble Tina Turner, because throughout the film's runtime - Bassett is Tina Turner. She even impressively nails Turner's legendary and unmistakable stage presence in the film's many high voltage concert re-creations. Even more incredibly, Bassett takes on this larger-than-life personality and makes her into a three-dimensional human being, without scaling down her considerable achievements.It's a performance that ranks among the best of all time and, in the many years since the film's release, it has yet to be equaled. Though Bassett was nominated for an Oscar for her work here, the fact that she went home empty handed is an insult to this great actress and should remain an embarrassment to the film community. Justifiably, the Foreign Press relies less on politics and awarded Bassett with a much-deserved Golden Globe. It irritates me to no end that the immature, modestly talented Hallie Berry will go down in history as the first African American to win a Best Actress Oscar when the regal and lady-like Bassett has her beat in talent, beauty, and grace.The film version of Ike Turner could have easily become a one-note monster, but Laurence Fishburne creates an Ike whose emotions are varied and shaded. He can be charming, chilling, sympathetic, and as frightening as hell. Unlike Bassett, he never really overcomes the physical limitations of being compared to the real Ike Turner, as he is too handsome and muscular to be physically believable as the wiry, homely Turner. Fishburne also delivers an Oscar-worthy performance (He was nominated alongside Bassett and probably should have won as well).While WHAT'S LOVE would be worth watching for the performances of Bassett and Fishburne alone, the film itself stands as one of the screen's best show biz tales. It may stretch some of the facts (for the sake of dramatic coherency) every now and then, but the film delivers the goods emotionally with many moving scenes. Director Brian Gibson breathtakingly recreates many of the Revue's finest performances, the A Fool In Love and Proud Mary numbers are particularly stunning. Turner herself re-recorded all of the vocals, and the then-54-year-old singer still has enough power and soul to completely shame the whiny-voiced R&B divas of today.

Unless they were Ike Turner, that is. When we walked out of seeing the movie during its first run in the theater, my husband commented dryly, Well, that movie didn't paint a very flattering portrait of Ike. and we both laughed at the understatement. If you've read the Tina's book, though, you'll know that the movie goes VERY easy on him-while merely a typical abusive bully in the film, Ike treated her much, much worse in real life. I think if they put even half the abuse and torture he put her through in real life, though, the movie would have been too much of a downer-you got the idea. Fishburne does a good job of making Ike so charming when Tina first meets him that you can see why she falls in love with him, until he turns into a monster. Angela Bassett is just fantastic, she has Tina down perfect, though her upper body is so pumped up in some scenes she looks almost masculine. Tina Turner was (hell, still is at 60) toned and buff, but not a female bodybuilder. Her performance is dynamic and heartbreaking, and I can't watch the scene where she finally gets sick of his abuse and starts fighting back. When she finally hits him back in the scene in the limo, I heard the loudest cheers and applause in the audience that I've heard since I saw Thelma and Louise. I've seen the movie dozens of times and her passion in that scene still gets me emotional every time.But the real reason I watch the movie over and over (especially when I'm trying to get motivated to work out) are the musical numbers. They include among others A Fool in Love, Rock me Baby a great montage to Make me Over, but the centerpiece of the film has got to be the perfect recreation, right down to the choreography, of the Ike and Tina Turner Revue's Proud Mary. It is full of so much energy and rocks so much that your jaw will just hang open in amazement when Tina and the Ikettes start going into their dance moves. I never get tired of watching that scene (almost as good as the real thing). I'm still trying to figure out how they kept their wigs on when they were whipping their upper bodies back and forth, they danced so hard. Oh, and the costumes (especially on the Ikettes and the Proud Mary fringe dress) and period detail are not only accurate but To Die For. I can't recommend this movie enough. She should have got the Academy Award, not just the Golden Globe, and the movie should have got the Oscar for best picture of 1993.

As expected, the majority of the film focuses on Anna Mae's relationship with Ike Turner, a musician who works steadily but stays on the cusp of stardom until meeting Anna Mae, changing her name to Tina and making her the lead singer of the group. The film shines a not-too-flattering light on Ike's abusive treatment of Tina, which ranges from severe beatings to marital rape. The screenplay, clearly based on Tina's autobiography I, TINA, is kind of one-sided...in the film, Tina is presented as just this side of Mother Theresa and that Ike single-handedly destroyed their marriage, but in later years, Turner has admitted that the movie does paint Ike in an unflattering light and that she had as much to do with the destruction of their marriage as he did. On the other hand, it is the single-sided view of the screenplay that helps to make this movie so entertaining...we have a crystal clear heroine and an equally clear villain here that arouse the expected reactions from the filmgoers. Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishbourne deliver electrifying performances as the Turners, performances that earned them both Oscar nominations and are the anchor of this film. Bassett does a more than credible job of lip-syncing to original Tina recordings. Yes, it may gloss over the facts and the actors may not look like the people they are portraying, but this film is powerhouse entertainment from start to finish.

When I was 4 years old I would walk around with a walk man and sing out loud What's Love Got To Do With It?, and my mom would laugh and she eventually told me when I got a little older what the song was about. I still blast and sing the song every time I hear it and understand it's power, afterwards, I wanted to read the book I, Tina and my heart was shattered for Tina and I just wanted to be like her and have her strength. Finally, I saw this film last night and I was blown away by such a terrific performance by Angela and Lawerence! They were truly amazing and made this film an incredibly biography.This is based on Tina Turner's life, mainly what happened between her and Ike, the utter and horrific abuse that ensued by Ike by his jealous rage of Tina's spotlight. Tina has only one friend by her side that truly defends her against Ike and Tina tries so hard to get away, but Ike won't let her. Finally, Tina has just had enough in an extremely emotional scene, they have a fight in the limo and Tina swings back at Ike finally! You just cheer and scream for her to leave and she finally gets what she truly deserved, the solo career and utter fame for being a truly gifted star.I have a feeling things were a bit exaggerated in the film, you know, the fights? But I think almost 25 years of an abusive marriage is hard to get into a 2 hour film, so they had to make you understand the pain Tina went through. Angela did a terrific job, one of the best performances I have ever seen in fact, I was just cheering for her in that limo! I cried and cheered for Tina, she is truly a remarkable woman and to understand that, please read the book and watch What's Love Got To Do With It.10/10 "}{"Title":"An incredible movie from start to finish","Date":"26 September 1999","Score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Music","Review":"  Angela Basset gives an Oscar-winning performance as Tina Turner.

First of all she was still alive and at an all time popular height and second of all, she in my opinion is not a that big star, when compared to all other people who get a biopic made about them. But I must say that after seeing this movie i have a whole lot more respect for her by now and I was definitely wrong about her career and life not being worthy or interesting enough for making a movie about it.The movie was a positive surprise. But nevertheless there still is plenty wrong with it as a biopic. It suffers from lots of the stuff other genre movies often suffer from. Thing with biopics often is that you try to capture a persons entire life and career into a 2 hour long movie. This means some stuff will often get rushed and shoved down your throat. You often just have to take things for granted, without them ever getting developed properly and convincing enough, like would be the case in a normal film drama about a normal average, every day person. And yes, this happens quite a lot in this movie. It often makes some very sudden jumps with its story and make jumps in time as well. We just never get to see how popular Tina Tuner is with the public and some things seem to happen very randomly in this movie, just because they happened in her real life as well. It at times feels like some stuff really got crow-bared into the film. They movie because of that also feels quite distant at times as a biopic, since you don't ever get the feeling you are really getting into the character.But having said all that, the movie still works out great. The story is always intriguing and keeps you interest throughout. It's also really fast-going, which makes this a bit of a distant one when it comes down to its emotions and characters but at the same time keeps this movie consistently good to watch, since you never get bored with things.It's also true that it are the actors performance that keep the movie going and make this a great watch. Angela Bassett really shines and she deserved her Oscar nomination. Same goes for Laurence Fishburne as the abusive Ike Turner, who is perhaps the foremost reason why this movie remains such a good and interesting watch. His character, no matter how awful he is, is still what gives the story as well as the Tina Turner some real depth. Because lets face it, would Tina Turner's life had been interesting enough for a biopic if she had never met Ike? I really don't think so.But of course the movie does not only focus on her personal life but also her career. It's quite fascination to see how she started out and at several points at her career had to start all over again but every time came back stronger, as a performer and person as well. It's why I now have so much more respect for her after seeing this movie. I now kind of wished I would had gone to her concert when she was in town here a decade ago. Besides, I really don't think you have to be a fan of her music in order to enjoy and appreciate her incredible stage presence and performance. Same sort of goes for this movie. You really don't have to be that much in Tina Turner in order to really like and appreciate this movie.8/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"ITS WORTH SEE!!!!!!!!!!","Date":"15 June 2003","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Music","Review":"  This is a very good movie.

There are also biopics that seem to be memorable and popular with mainstream Hollywood, such as the Rocky series, Ali, Ray, Walk The Line to name but many. But 'What's Love Got to Do With It?' is neither a made-for-TV type of film, nor did it reclaim instant recognition and appraisal from the Academy Awards folk, seeing as it was harshly and virtually ignored. Bassett was nominated for a best actress gong, only for that to go to Holly Hunter in the rather dull drama,'The Piano' whilst Fishburne lost out to Tom Hanks, who starred in the overrated 'Philiadelphia' for best actor. It is indeed one of the very few (music-based) biopic films where in which it delivers strong but impressive performances from the main leads without all the necessary commercialised bravado and hype. 'What's Love Got to Do With It?' chronicles the imminent and illustrious life and times of Anna Mae Bullock aka Tina Turner- one of the most prominent and successful female solo recording artists in (pop)music, ever.The narrative of the film attempts to present to the audience a glimpse into the difficult hardships that Tina had to endure both as a child and as an adult, as well as her troublesome and at times violent marital relationship with her husband, Ike. Laurence Fishbourne excels in this role, even though some would argue that he bears little resemblance to Ike Turner, in physical terms. He is so convincing and yet so menacing and vile as Ike, you just feel nothing but total repulsion towards him for the way he has treated his wife. Beating and hitting her so hard, i'm sure it wasn't easy for Fishburne and Bassett to film such difficult scenes because on screen for us viewers, the violence, which was being inflicted on Tina by her lover, was so brutal to watch. As for Bassett, she may not be an accomplished vocalist in her own right, but her lip-synching of the tracks during the music performances of the film was impressive and she succeeded in capturing and projectifying Tina's mannerisms and presence on stage.What I like in particular about this movie also, is that as it is based on a true life account of Tina Turner's ups and downs, in contrast to other similar themed auto-biographical films, the events that unfold throughout the duration of this production are presented to us, not in an idealised way but as and when it happened, no matter how bleak and unsettling it is and was. Ali, Ray and even Malcolm X all celebrated the achievements of Black African American heroism but that they also celebrate the acceptance and importance of Black masculinity within what was then a predominantly white society and what it is to be male, Black and American. In Tina Turner,and this film, it in a way celebrates and acknowledges the contribution of Black femininity through her struggles and in overcoming such struggles and through her music, in addition for others to make sense of what it is to be female, Black and American.Although the abuse scenes are often difficult to stomach, particularly the rape scene where Tina is attacked by Ike, which I found incredibly disheartening and painful to sit through, 'What's Love Got to Do With It?' is an unmistakable- yet intense journey of emotions, sheer brutality and pure heartache on the part of the so- called main protagonist. But of course, Tina does indeed triumph in the end, which is a wonderful thing. And although it feels like it is like any other film with a predominantly Black cast, the fact that Tina Turner's music caters for all audiences and not just the Black community at large, means that regardless of your social, ethnic background, gender or sexuality,'What's Love Got to Do With It?' is an extremely accessible and engaging film that is as hard-hitting and powerful as it is moving. And in Angela Bassett, she should be a much, much bigger movie star than she is right now. It is unbelievable that this underrated actress doesn't receive as many film roles that she rightly deserves.Nevertheless, this film has to be one of the cult classics of all- time and the brilliance of the performances have to be seen to be believed. If you're a massive Tina Turner fan, you'll love this, but if you love to watch great acting and expect a good story, then this is definitely worth seeing as well.

The film gets two very gutsy performances in the form of Angela Basette and Lawerence Fishburne. They make a great on screen pairing mostly however in the violent abuse scenes that show Ike to be the most hateful of men. Fishburne does not try to be likable but based on the material he was a violent drug taking womaniser. Fishburne is a powerhouse and deserved fully his Oscar Nomination. However the film belongs to Basette. I think virtually everyone will agree that this is a performance that requires a lot of depth. From happier then happy rock and roll star of the sixties to abused and sudicial Anna Mae Bullock. The film is slightly frustrating because too much goes on and there are too many scenes dedicated to this and that but i found it wonderful to watch such unparallelled acting. The setting provides for a brilliant use of dazzling cinematography and brilliant outfits (virtually anything Ike wears I would wear!.) The end scenes also make the film balance out. Watching the final number What's Love Got to do With it? shows that people can learn from there mistakes.For this film though the music, costumes, setting and overall mood does not beat the two Oscar nominated (and well deserved winners) of a film like this. Very much watching and the kind of film where you're next purchase is the soundtrack. Well that is a cracker.Finally Basette's Tina is on par with Garland's Vicki Lester in A STAR IS BORN.

I must admit-- I have not read Turner's autobiography upon which the film is based, but I have searched the web and I do not find any criticism regarding its accuracy from Tina Turner, herself.If this movie had been released in this millennium rather than in the last, it would have gotten more praise and recognition. About Lawrence Fishburne you do not have to like his character. I recall Denzel Washington in Training Day or Charlize Theron in Monster. I did not like them either and for THAT the actors are brilliant and so is Fishburne.

But What's Love....? is a superb movie, Angela recreated Tina in the most exceptional way, I would rather want to meet Angela instead of Tina, only because she's an actor and mines well be every person she every played. Where is Female/Actress of the Year, leave the nominations for the people who only deserves the nominations, but give the Awards to the people who deserve the Awards, like Bassett. She didn't do a bad job in the Jacksons, another biography, then Malcolm X, not to mention the small roles she entered into in the 80s and throughout the 90s, and recently playing Rosa Parks in the Rosa Parks Story. If she don't get a Actress of the Year Award, I don't care if it's Supporting Actress of the Year, then I know something is wrong. I have people listed for those Awards.

So, after seeing a preview for it in front of our recently-rented copy of Strictly Ballroom, my wife and I were reminded of it and decided to check it out and see if lived up to the hype.We were expecting a rather rote interpretation of a singer's climb to stardom.  What we got instead was a harrowing, engaging, cautionary tale that's not just about Tina Turner's rise to the top, but is also a chilling indictment of spousal abuse.Surprising, to say the least.  Since we'd gone in thinking What's Love Got to Do with It is simply a charming film starring an actress who's giving her best Tina Turner imitation, we were hardly ready for the emotional impact this movie has.I hope any man who's ever beaten his wife, or who's even ever thought of it, sees this movie.  And any woman who's currently in an abusive relationship should definitely see it -- if only to help them get out.

So in my opinion, this movie is my #1 of all time. This movie had a huge impact on me. The movie, based on the wonderful book I, Tina written by Tina and Kurt Loder, is simply fantastic. It shows what kind of person Tina is strong. As a little Anna Mae Bullock, she was abandoned by her parents. She stood by her husband Ike, despite the fact that he did drugs, slept with other women and beat her. But enough is enough. Tina couldn´t stand it any longer. She left Ike and finally got a divorce. Tina started to rebuild her career as a solo artist but it wasn´t an easy job. After years of working and touring, finally in 1983 Tina hit the charts with the cover of Al Green´s Let´s Stay Together. Tina made the greatest comeback ever. She became the greatest singer of all time, the Queen Of Rock, Female Lioness, Female Tiger Of Rock, Mega Diva... She became the biggest female rock star ever. She became thebest-selling female live performer in history. She became a legend. And even now, after 40 years in business, she´s one of the most beloved artists out there. And this movie salutes this wonderful woman. Angela Bassett shines in her role as Tina. She is simply sensational! Ike´s role is played by Laurence Fishburne and he does excellent job as well. Bassett got a Golden Globe for her role and both Bassett and Fishburne were nominated for Academy Awards. Unfortunately, they didn´t won but it´s an award to be nominated as well. This film includes violent scenes in which Ike beats Tina. They are not nice or easy to watch and we can only imagine what happened in real life during those years Tina was with Ike.This movie also includes fantastic music. Tina herself re-recorded some old songs for this movie and they can be heard in the movie and on the fantastic soundtrack. A Fool In Love, It´s Gonna Work Out Fine, Nutbush City Limits, River Deep - Mountain High, Proud Mary, Shake A Tail Feather, (Darlin´) You Know I Love You, Disco Inferno, Tina´s Wish plus What´s Love Got To Do With It and I Might Have Been A Queen - All these fantastic, irresistible classics!!! The music scenes are wonderful to watch (if you have seen Tina in concert you´ll know why), especially the live performances of Shake A Tail Feather and Proud Mary. The movie ends with Tina´s ´93 recording I Don´t Wanna Fight which is a really good song as well. If you are a fan of good music, this movie is for you! This is a perfect movie. Great story, great music, great performances. Tears came in my eyes many times during the violent scenes but especially in the end. Tina becomes a mega star and the real Tina is singing What´s Love Got To Do With It in her 1985 concert. She gives that wonderful smile and looks so happy... Then I Don´t Wanna Fight starts playing and at this point, tears are flowing on my cheeks. Tina Turner is simply the best. This movie is simply the best. See it. Now.10 out of 10.

Not a bad movie, actually, just not very accurate or fair to Ike. Annie Mae Bullock was not the innocent little country girl she's made out to be when she met Ike. Ike, in reality, was half Laurence Fishburne's size (and in a punch-up between him & Tina, my money'd be on Tina). And the movie seems to suggest that Ike spent every day of the week beating on Tina, while in reality he was always working writing, rehearsing the band, recording, organizing tours etc. That is why the group was successful, while the movie seems to suggest that Tina was the only one with talent & Ike was nothing more than a parasite. Ike made much of music history what it is, scouting talent for the Sun & Modern labels for instance. The movie utterly destroyed his reputation & even now that he's dead, he'll never be remembered for his amazing work. Musicians & other close associates from the Ike & Tina days regularly dismiss this movie as a gross distortion of facts. Of course, that's what makes it a good movie - you can't build a story on facts.

At first, when I saw this movie, I was touched by her story and how she never gave up once. THe scene at the end is my favorite because it shows just how happy she is and that she basically is telling ike to kiss her *ss!! I have to point out that at the last scene when Angela is performing What's love... notice that each time it cuts to the audience watching her and look closely and you'll find somebody in the audience that looks just like Tina Turner herself! I noticed her because of her hair and her smile.She is wearing a black coat with an orange shirt underneath. It may not be her but it sure does look just like her!Anyway, this is, without a doubt, my favorite movie.

Laurence Fishburne can't help looking powerful (unlike Gary Busey, incidentally, who managed to play Buddy Holly).  The relationship is believable as a  movie relationship, but not as an Ike-and-Tina relationship.  One look at the real Ike Turner, and  you see this is not a man whose own physical power is going to get out of control.  He looks like a man whose fears, whose nerves, whose addictions have turned him dangerous, but he's not Othello and he's not Steinbeck's Lenny.  He's not the rhino, he's the rattlesnake.

(I understand that a life of Marvin Gaye is to come in the near future). What's Love Got to Do with It, based on Tina Turner's autobiography, was one of the earliest in this genre.Ray and Walk the Line both laid considerable emphasis on their subjects' early years. Like Ray Charles and Johnny Cash, Anna Mae Bullock (Tina's real name) was born in America's Deep South in the 1930s and grew up in poverty. Her birthplace, Nutbush, Tennessee, was later immortalised in her song Nutbush City Limits. (Her promotion of this small village to city status was presumably a piece of sardonic humour). The film does not, however, dwell on her childhood at any length, although there is one scene in which the young Anna Mae is thrown out of her local church choir for singing with too much fervour. (Ironically, she was later to renounce Christianity in favour of Buddhism, and this is dealt with in the film, although we are left with the misleading impression that the Buddhist religion consists of little more than the attainment of inner peace through the repeated chanting of a phrase in a foreign language).There is a convention, observed by most showbiz biographies, that success doesn't come easily. The star must be shown battling against internal demons or external forces which hinder his or her rise to the top and then threaten to destroy his or her career. This convention may be something of a cliché, yet it is often a necessary one, needed to give dramatic force to narratives that might otherwise be bland and uninteresting. It is for this reason that I found the Jennifer Lopez film Selena vaguely unsatisfactory. Selena Quintanilla-Perez seemed to achieve success as easily as breathing and, as portrayed by Lopez, was so innocent and wholesome that the concept of internal demons was entirely foreign to her. Her murder in the final scenes- even though this is what happened to the real Selena- seemed like an ending tacked on from some entirely different movie.In this film the threat to Tina is not an internal demon but an external one, in the shape of her husband, mentor, and performing partner, Ike, The film concentrates largely on the first two decades of Tina's career, and especially on her marriage. Yet, in the early part of the film, Ike is not the villain of the piece. In the 1950s he was an established star in his own right, and the film describes how he met Anna Mae while she was living in St Louis in the late fifties, how he became first her lover, then her husband and how created her career as a performer. They were to win fame in the sixties as a husband-and-wife double-act, Ike and Tina Turner. (Ike suggested that she take Tina as her stage name).As the film progresses, however, it becomes clear that Ike is an unstable personality with an uncontrollable temper, subject to fits of rage in which he abuses Tina both verbally and physically. Although he created her as a performer, he comes close to destroying her as a person. Eventually, after fifteen years Tina has had enough, and the marriage ends in divorce. The title is taken from another of her well-known songs, although it might also be taken as her comment on her marriage. What had love got to do with the way Ike treated her? The last part of the film deals with Tina's attempts to make a new career as a solo performer, but overlooks her long-standing relationship with her German partner Erwin Bach. Hollywood is often uncomfortable with the idea of mixed-race relationships, even real-life ones.Angela Bassett was very good at conveying the raw energy and sexual power of Tina's stage performances, although it is Tina's voice that we actually hear. I was, however, less impressed by her interpretation of the role in the rest of the film and was surprised that she was nominated for an Oscar, especially as there were some deserving performances that were overlooked (notably Michelle Pfeiffer in The Age of Innocence). Bassett's Tina, away from the stage or the recording studio, came across as too passive and willing to submit to Ike's demands, as well as a bit too saintly.Laurence Fishburne was better, bringing out both the Jekyll and the Hyde in Ike's character, both his charisma and his violent fury, although the film perhaps does not explain why their marriage should have lasted for so long. The film may have been based upon Tina's autobiography, but autobiographies are not always the most reliable sources of information, and this reliance on a single, partial, source means that What's Love Got to Do with It, although a very watchable and at times powerful drama, ends up rather unbalanced, with too many black and white distinctions and too few shades of grey. 6/10 "},{"Title":"Great Performer, Good PC Heroine","Date":"12 September 2006","Score":"12 out of 27 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Music","Review":" Wow, what a great story to promote Liberal and political correctness!

This has every filmmaker's leftist agenda, all rolled into one movie. Great!Rock superstar Tina Turner (played well by Angela Bassett) is the subject in the biography, which is still interesting despite the obvious agenda in certain areas. It's nicely photographed and has wonderful music. The story is interesting and tolerable except when Tina's husband Ike (Laurence Fishburne) gets abusive. Wife-beating is too ugly to enjoy watching. On a personal note Tina Turner will go down in history as one of the all-time greatest live rock performers ever. Her shows were fantastic and for her to be out there dancing at 60 years of age was remarkable. "}]
