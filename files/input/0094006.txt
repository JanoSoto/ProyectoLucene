[{"Title":"Excellent teen love story","Date":"18 January 2005","Score":"48 out of 50 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" It's refreshing to have a movie about teens in love that doesn't rely upon sex to gain the viewer's interest. I love this movie, have probably seen it a a few dozen times, especially in the original, unedited version (that wasn't shortened to fit into a two-hour TV time-slot). It's a classic story, but told from a timeless perspective---the movie first ran in 1987, yet there's extremely little in it that would make it seem dated.Mary Stuart Masterson is, as always, superb in her performance. While this is one of her early films, it shows her enormous ability and potential. She plays a playful, feisty, street-smart character that also has a sensitive, shy, and deeply loving side. Mary Stuart's kissing scene is one of the most wonderfully romantic and intense kissing scenes on film that I've seen, yet it has an innocent quality that makes it all the more special.Eric Stoltz and Lea Thompson give excellent performances as well, with good acting and both are able to highlight dialogue with subtle nuances. However, I feel that Mary Stuart's character is the most interesting and emotionally sensitive, enough that she'll bring tears to your eyes. This is an excellent film. It came out at a time when there were a lot of teen movies (Pretty in Pink, The Breakfast Club, etc.), but this is a story that never grows old and is a pleasure to watch again.

And I will even go far saying that this reverse Pretty In Pink is better than Pretty In Pink itself. Why? Good, honest performaces. Hughes decides to leave his Brat Packers behind and went with great choices in Eric Stoltz (who could've gave John Cusack a run for his money in the Teen Angst movie department), Lea Thompson and Mary Stewart Masterson, who steals the show as Watts. Sure the story is run of the mill, but it is the acting that pulls it through. Another good thing is that Thompson's character of Amanda Jones doesn't come off as being a snooty brat (for use of a better word). She is from the same part of town like Keith and tries to fit in with the 'cool' clique. Another good supporting performance is Duncan, the headbanger who is a regular in detention. I love how they forge a friendship through their art. And who can forget how Duncan and the lifers help Keith make his date with Amanda a success? One other thing I like is the soundtrack. It doesn't sound commerical like in other Hughes films. The music really suits every scenes it shows up in (especially the end credits that feature Lick The Tins take on 'Can't Help Falling In Love'). Molly Ringwald reportedly turned down a role in this film, but it's good that she did because I couldn't picture her in this classic. Great film.

I was best friends with a boy in my class, we were both into music, theater and art and did'nt fit in with the popular-preppy kids in school and really did'nt fit in with the pot-head-troublemakers either. We just did'nt fit in anywhere.. but we always had one another and hung out all the time. I was totally in love with him (still am to this very day, he will always be a part of my life and in my heart)... well, he just did'nt have a clue that I cared about him in that way and all I ever heard was how much he loved one of the cheerleaders. She never gave him the time of day and he still had this thing for her... Our story was'nt as happy though, he never found out how I felt for him.. I got married to someone else later on and so did he and we have since lost touch and I have been looking for him. Guess the first time I seen this movie, I liked it just because it was SUCH a good movie but a few years later seeing it, it really hit me in the face and to this day I always watch it whenever I get the chance and remember my friend...

A great mix of comedy and teen melodrama, this film perfectly combined all the best elements of a John Hughes film. By switching the sexes- Eric Stoltz as Molly Ringwald, and Mary Stuart Masterson as Jon Cryer- of Pretty in Pink, the film delves deeper than The Breakfast Club- almost accidentally. The chemistry between Stolz and Masterson is powerful and real, something missing in almost all John Hughes films, and it pays off. This one has stayed with me since it came out, and I've watched it since and it holds up really well. Great supporting actors like John Ashton and Elias Koteaus provide fun comedy breaks, and little Candace Cameron as the little sister is terrific too- she went on to great TV fame. But the strength of the film is the fine acting. Stoltz has the harder more thankless role, and gives it a depth and charm that are a relief to see, and Masterson all but steals the movie. Together they are John Hughes best couple, even though he didn't direct this film.

I lived on the outskirts of what was basically a country club neighborhood, but was not that kind of gal.  So I found it wonderfully refreshing to find a role model in the pre-Girl-Power girl power of Watts.  I fell in love along side her (and to this day, harbor a special place in my heart for Eric Stoltz), begged my parents to let me learn the drums, and knew every line by heart.  She was tough, witty, and (according to my older brother) incredibly sexy.  Eric Stoltz is dreamy in a working class kind of way and puts in a performance of true depth and character.  This movie has heart without being sickly sweet.  It delves into family relationships, friendships, and romance.  Most notably, it tackles something that the current teen fair seems to lack, social consciousness.  It's not afraid to break stereotypes or point out social injustice.  Not to mention, it has one of the best soundtracks of the '80s.  I give it an A++!!!

John Hughes has written yet another excellent story about a classical tale of teen romance. The first time I saw this movie was on t.v. at 200 in the morning. And I stayed up for every last minute of it. First of all, the cast is great. Howard Deutch pulled together some really remarkable actors and actresses for the roles of this movie.Lets start with Lea Thompson playing the popular girl, Amanda Jones. She did a fine job playing the poor girl who hangs out with all the rich kids. This role must of been really hard for her because she didn't look like a poor girl at all. I mean its Lea Thompson for christ sake! And in my opinion we have to give her alot of credit for having the guts to do this role. She came through with it and that is all that matters!Next is Craig Sheffer acting as the antagonist, Hardy Jenns. This guy did a pretty good job of acting as the rich, handsome, popular school boy who went out with Amanda Jones. In fact he did such a good job at acting his part that I wanted to punch the t.v. when I saw his face pop up on the screen. Hardy was a real a**hole!The shy kid Keith Nelson acted by Eric Stolz, definintley reminds me of myself. That is one of the reasons why this movie really inflicted a lot of trauma on me from the beginning. We are both shy, independent, nice guys. I also look alot like him too! Except I have green eyes! Kinda scary if you dont mind me saying. Anyway, Eric does a marvelous performance as the protagonist of this film. Good job man!Last but not least we have the beautifull,breathtaking,astonishing, Mary Stuart Masterson! This movie was the first time I saw her. And she took my breathe away!!!!! Playing the short blonde haired tomboy Watts, she has got some real talent. After I saw her in this movie,I knew I must see the rest of her movies she has been in. And I must say, she looks the best in this movie without a dout. Its just the fact that you can see that face of her's and see her smile. She definitley has the best smile I have ever seen in my entire life! And that is saying a lot for someone I don't even really know that well. Maybe sometime later in life I can meet her in person. I think we would do well together. No offense Damon. LOL!But in all the movies I have seen, Some Kind of Wonderful touches me from the heart and reminds me about life and all the hard times that come with it. This is a landmark movie that will never leave my shelf.Rating10/10 stars "},{"Title":"an intelligent teen comedy/romance","Date":"18 November 2000","Score":"16 out of 20 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  Mary stuart Masterson plays a girl who has a crush on Eric Stoltz who has been friends with her for a long time but she never has told her feelings.

Written by John Hughs, the story-line is far from original, greatly resembling Pretty in Pink, but it still has an endearing charm that makes it a classic. The story line follows as such the lead male, a sensitive loner named Keith(Eric Stolz) is considered an outsider because he would rather focus on his art work than to be a jock, a nerd, or a trouble maker. He doesn't fit into any preexisting group. His only friend is a tomboyish drummer named Watts(Mary Stuart Masterson) who is in love with him, but he doesn't know. Keith wants to date the popular Amanda Jones(Lea Thompson), but she is dating a possessive, controlling, overtly rich Hardy Jenns(Craig Sheffer). Amanda breaks up with him, and to make it final she agrees to go out on a date with Keith. To Keith this is dream come true. He uses his newly formed connections with the out crowd to orchestrate an amazing date. Even going so far as spend all his college savings on a pair of diamond earrings for Amanda. Watts, ever faithful to Keith, volunteers to be their chauffeur for the evening. Hardy has invited both Keith and Amanda to a party he is throwing that night, but the real reason is so that he and his friends can jump Keith and beat him up. Keith hears about this and makes sure that his new-found friends keep the fight even. Just Keith and Hardy, but Hardy chickens out and is exposed as the spineless sleaze-ball we all knew he was. Amanda gives Keith back the diamond earrings and opts instead to be alone and learn who she is when she isn't defining herself by the boy she is dating. Watts has left the party and is walking away when Keith begins to run after her, he kisses her and gives her the earrings. Love wins out in the end and Keith utters the paramount quote, You look good wearing my future.This movie has my respect because it accurately portrays the social themes of the 80's without making them look cheesy; themes such as trying to figure out who you were, who your real friends were, the joy and pain of falling in love, and rebelling against your parents. Durring the 80's people felt liberated by the release of tensions with the ending of the Cold War. Stolz gave a great performance as a misunderstood, out of place teen trying to find his way. And Thompson was very believable as the poor girl from the working class neighborhood who tried to fit into the popular crowd; surprisingly enough, she didn't come off as pretentious, quite the opposite in fact, appearing deep and amiable. In America during the 80's social status was much more defined; people began to focus more on the individual and the individual's accomplishments.But Mary Stuart Masterson stole the show with her amazing portrayal of Watts. Not only was she witty, but she carried you along her emotional journey. Even when Keith had chosen Amanda, Watts still stood by him as long as she could. Her tough facade clearly hid an emotionally vulnerable woman who's lifelike predicament spoke to so many.Though this movie was not an initial box office smash, it is a perfect example of the 80's genre. Once you have seen this film it will inevitably become one of your all time favorites.

We, the audience, see very early on that Watts wishes Keith were her boyfriend instead of just a boy friend.  But Keith doesn't notice her that way.  Until perhaps when Watts offers him to practice kissing before his big date.Typical teen clique and rivalry issues, rich boy in town wants to own Amanda, but also goes after every other cute girl. The showdown is at rich boy's house, where he, being basically chicken tries to have his friends take Keith out and mess him up.  About that time Keith's friends, the rough guys in school, show up and quash the dirty deed.Amanda realizes the lie she has been living, and presumably is a better person for the future, and leaves her silly friends behind. As Watts, who was the chauffer for the night, walks away, Keith catches up with her, they kiss, he gives her the diamond earrings that he cashed in his college fund for, and we are to assume Keith and Watts live happily ever after.The three principals are very good in this mostly predictable film, especially Masterson as Watts. She is such a good actress that I find myself wondering why we don't see her in high-profile roles more often.Though not totally sure, I think Some Kind of Wonderful gets its title from the realization, at the end, what Watts is.

They interview the cast- briefly- Eric Stoltz and Mary Stuart Masterson are insightful and kind and interesting. So is the girl who plays the little sister. Mostly it's fun to see everyone older. Some have aged very well- Eric Stoltz and the girl who played his sister. Others have not.Then they have the 'commentary' (and I use that word lightly) as you watch the movie. They foolishly only had the director and Leah Thompson commenting, and it's the most shallow silly commentary I've ever heard. That shot is lovely, Howie Thanks dear. Look how pretty you are in this scene! I'm not kidding. I could have tolerated this nonsense, if they hadn't gone further.Eric was tough in this scene. He had his own way of working that made me uncomfortable. I know, he wanted to be called by his character name. Mary Stuart had a tough day that day, look at her. I know, she took it so seriously THEY WERE THE BEST THINGS IN THE MOVIE, YOU DOPES!!! And I only wish they'd been allowed to comment on the movie, because their interviews were the only insightful and articulate and smart interviews on the whole DVD.And we true SKOW fans know what happened on this movie- they fired the first director Martha Coolidge and half the cast- does this DVD talk about that? Of course not. They allude to the tension on the set, but must'Nat allow any true emotions on a DVD extra. It's obvious they cut out a LOT of interesting stuff, tried to make it a puff piece.

But the story is undeniably captivating and heart-warming due to Hughes' incredible talent for writing believable dialogue for young people.  One cannot help but be drawn in by Keith, the young and talented misfit hero, who amazes us with his cool demeanor and confidence in the face of adversity.  Hughes creates a true soul mate for him in the character of Watts, whose strength of character and biting wit blend perfectly with her sensitivity and (not too well hidden) beauty.  It is a film that reminds us of the earlier Pretty in Pink, but finally gives us the satisfaction we were deprived of when Andie chose Blaine over Duckie.

She lets him know that she doesn't approve with her snide comments and concerns for him. I like to think it's her way of alerting her somewhat oblivious friends to her feelings for him. Mary Stuart Masterson did an impeccable job as the sexy tomboy best friend.Keith's character, although cute in his naive and unsure manner, isn't as likable as Watts; But this is masterfully done because you feel that his character shouldn't be as cool as Watts. You see in him purity of mind and heart and you know that without his best friend he wouldn't get very far in life before someone or something rocks his world, (and not in a good way.) All of these characters at first seem shallow and underdeveloped, but as you watch you realize that that is part of the movie's charm. You don't know everything about these characters because you are only glimpsing a week in the life of these kids, and they aren't spilling their guts and innermost feelings to you like in The Breakfast Club and they don't pine and long for someone they know they cannot have such as the characters in Pretty in Pink and Sixteen Candles. They try to attain what their hearts want the most, but the two go about it differently. By the end of this movie you're smiling (Not at the abrupt ending where Keith realizes who he really loves) but at the fact that you know that this here is another classic and you think, Yes, this is John Hughes.

Several sequences here are variations of scenes from Ferris Bueller's Day Off, released the year before. Post 1987, all of Hughes' movies would become increasingly worthless (though stuff like Home Alone and Beethoven have merit as children's flicks), the director's brand of teen angst being replaced by the foul mouthed shenanigans of Kevin Smith, the View Askew maverick stealing the plots of Hughes' films and spicing them up with sex jokes and swearing.Worth one viewing.

Who hasn't shared such experiences while searching for a special friend? That special feeling of calling some one your own takes over your life completely.Clifford (John Ashton ) has put away for his son Keith (Eric Stoltz) a goodly sum for his College studies, but Keith is blinded by his crush on Amanda who seems to be available to all the boys particularly the well-to-do.One of the best and liveliest scenes in the film is the argument between Keith and his father who has discovered that his son has withdrawn the whole sum from the bank account to buy a pair of diamond earrings to impress Amanda and outdo his rivals.Not all the scenes are so impressive and the story line lacks originality except for the chauffeur scene near the end which was a pretty stupid and unbelievable arrangement.Watts played by Mary Stuart Masterson (and well done too) dotes on Keith but he is too blind to understand her feelings for him. All the mixed and misunderstood feelings require a good deal of sorting out by the characters and this is where the interest lies in the film. Will Keith wake up to himself and realize that true love is knocking at his door?It's a pleasant little story of teenage problems which many of us will recall as a part of our own lives. That we can align with so many of the frustrations is a key to the popularity of the film.

Anyway I had already planned to watch this film because recent trips to the films of the 80's had reminded me of this film and how much I used to love it. I was curious to watch it again and indeed when I did nostalgia did play a part in my enjoyment as I realised that I used to have the soundtrack on tape, watched several scenes again and again on VHS and genuinely loved the tomboy Watts. This all helped but I am not able to be blind to the fact that, as a film, it is quite good but has one or two pretty big problems that sadly do take away from the total film.The most obvious is in the material. In terms of the basics, all the Hughes standards are in place here and we know where we are going with this from the start. That is not an issue, what is an issue is the intensity and the depth that the film tries to operate on. The relationship between Watts and Keith goes too quickly from appearing to be nothing but friends to being tense, with his own realisation happening too quickly (even if it does make for a nice ending). Likewise things move too quickly with Amanda and Keith &#x96; the promise of a first date being the same as dating and the emotional events that follow being far too intense, the love professed too deep and the lessons learnt too important and big to be sustained by the rather basic development that underpins them. At one point my girlfriend said have I missed lots of this or something because the shift in the character dynamics did not seem to come from anywhere other than a rush to get there by the film itself. This same problem manifests itself in the final third as well, as it does feel like Keith has gone all in in a way that makes no sense, whereas the same could have been done with lower stakes and feel more convincing for it.Of course I did still go along with it despite this and there is a lot that still works within the context of this being a genre movie. It is hard not to feel for Watts, while other characters add much needed comedy to take the edge off the rather overly done angst. The basic relationship did feel right as well, although perhaps that is more down to one's experience and feelings &#x96; certainly the awkward friendship thing works for me since I do have a lot more female than male friends and always have. It also helps that I love the cast, or at least loved Mary Stuart Masterson as Watts. OK so her material rushes her but she does really well at letting her awkwardness show and also still being attractive in those clothes. Unfortunately Stoltz does not manage it so easily. He overplays his weirdness to the point where he is hard to stay with as a viewer &#x96; practically creepy at some points. He isn't helped by the places his material forces him to go in his feelings but he does lack the charm and easy charisma that Masterson manages. Thompson has similar problems with her material giving her character massive jumps but she is pretty good as Amanda Jones. Sheffer easily nails the rich bully/creep character while Koteas is great fun as Duncan. Ashton maybe has to feed the angst more than he gets to just be a character but he is solid while Bure and Corman are very funny as Keith's sisters.Some Kind of Wonderful is not as great as many say and it is not the brilliant film that I remember it has (who'd have thunk it?) however it does still have plenty of charm and much to enjoy. Such a shame that it is damaged quite badly by how fast and deep the material has it moving &#x96; making it less engaging and convincing as it goes along, although some nice performances and good comedy help it hold together despite this.

John Hughes wrote and produced the film about teenagers who are probably closer to real life than in most other films. Eric Stoltz is Kevin, a guy who thinks the ultimate girl is the most popular and best looking. Well isn't it? I guess boobs like me need movies like this to tell us we're wrong. Lea Thompson, everyone's it girl in the mid 1980's, is Amanda, the ideal girl. She plays it perfectly with a sense of vulnerability not often seen in her role. Mary Stuart Masterson is Watts, a drummer who can't convince Kevin what a dope he is for going after Amanda. Craig Sheffer is the obnoxious boyfriend of Amanda's who turns the audience off long before Amanda. The supporting cast is terrific, as in most of Hughes-penned films.However, there are a few elements in the film that are disappointing. The first is Kevin blowing his college money on the big night. Kevin may not be that socially astute, but guys like him are not completely foolish when it comes to their own interests. Second, Masterson is not really that appealing, although she's a very good actress in this film. Short hair, like hers, was not attractive in 1987, even though she was a tomboy. Third, I don't buy the ending, but undoubtedly the ending is exactly why many people, especially women, will fondly recall the film as so romantic. Fourth, guys never seem to make their own choices when appearing in films like this. Destiny plays too much of a role for my taste maybe.The Grand Funk Railroad song does not appear in the film, which makes one wonder why the reference to begin with? Amanda Jones, of course, is a Rolling Stones' song, Watts is the last name of the drummer in the Rolling Stones, and Keith is, well you know, Keith. No Mick in here though. The soundtrack is filled with plentiful songs that go well with many scenes, as is the case in John Hughes' films. The film starts out OK, gets better as it goes along, peaks on the big night with Kevin and Amanda, and comes crashing to a disappointing halt at the end. It just doesn't ring true, and most viewers will figure out exactly how this will end. **1/2 of 4 stars.

Similiarly, Mary Stuart Masterson, who plays Keith's best friend Watts, gives the best performance out of all the actors.

A better title would be Some Kind of Wonderful Performance by Mary Stuart Masterson.  When this film was first released in 1987 I considered it a pleasant but unremarkable low-budget film with a relatively  unknown cast.  About a year ago, however, I saw it again on TV and was blown away by the MSM character Watts.  Since then I have watched this film at least 25 times on the new DVD and DVD player I purchased for this purpose.  Yes folks, it is that good.  I must warn you, however, that the plot is rather predictable and some of the dialogue may leave you scratching your head.  But these shortcomings must be over-looked because this film gives MSM the opportunity to give the best performance of her career.Now, I must admit that if the watts character had been a guy, my reaction would have been a lot less enthusiastic.  There is something about her tomboy character that is very appealing to men, or at least to some men, or at least to me.  Of course having a gorgeous face doesn't hurt either.  I think part of Watts' appeal is her fierce loyalty to Keith.  They have been best friends since the third grade and you are somehow convinced that she will always be there for him no matter what. At one emotional moment Watts says to Keith The only things I care about in this bleep life are me, my drums and you. Even when she get angry and calls him a moron and stupid (she actually calls him stupid twice), you know she doesn't mean it, and in fact, the way she says it is rather endearing. Another part of her appeal is the knowledge that beneath the tough tomboy exterior is a sympathetic, vulnerable young woman.  She is an outcast at school and, except for Keith, has no friends.  She shares a parent-less house with her brothers who apparently have little involvement in her life.  So, not only is Keith her best friend but he is also her family.  Us guys, through Keith, want to be there to take care of her.  I guess, we just can't help wanting to be the hero.

What is different about what he writes, is that it is socially accurate, as well as being seriously entertaining.There's no denying his past successes with this genre Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink. Here, however, he moves away from the poignant stereotypes Keith (Stoltz), is not a geek. He's not a jock, and he isn't a criminal. He's an artist, and because of this, he doesn't fit in; Watts (Masterson) is his tomboy friend. She isn't a basketcase, although at times she undoubtedly feels like one vying for Keith's attention; and Amanda Jones (Thompson) is not a princess, even though her social appearance and demeanour might suggest this. They are all troubled, but in subtler, more hidden ways than the Saturday morning detention group in Breakfast Club.The movie begins by setting the goal Keith wants to date Amanda because he finds her attractive and perhaps a little beyond his reach. As the scenes progress, we discover a more complex triangle developing between the three main characters Keith fancies Amanda; Watts fancies Keith; and Amanda uses Keith to escape from her lecherous, manipulative boyfriend. The vehicle for this to unfold is the evening of the date and the ex-boyfriend's party.Character portrayal is delightfully strong. You believe in Keith and want him to succeed. You feel emotionally for Watts and share in her invisibility. You want to hate Amanda but cannot. In addition, supporting characters are superb and scene-stealing in their own right. Duncan (Koteas) shakes off the expected mantle of bully to become the saviour, while ex-boyfriend Hardy Jenns (Sheffer) evokes hatred and loathing from his callous, self-gratifying, but nonetheless cowardly existence.The movie ambles at a steady pace. This is no rollercoaster ride of laughs or drama. Instead, we are given a chance to explore each of the main character's psychological make-up, and ultimately, we are rewarded with an ending sequence to infuse us with hope and joy.This is a film which did not light up the box office, but which justifiably should be held up as the strongest example of its genre, and which entertains in the most wonderful way.

The class tensions of the 1980s crop up as real obstacles for the characters to deal with (especially Thompson -- buying in, or selling out?). And how can you beat that great opening theme by the late, lamented Propaganda?

In the meantime, tomboy girl Mary Stuart Masterson thinks Stoltz is just the greatest thing around, but he can't see for the rich princess Masterson just dazzles him.Sheffer even encourages Thompson to play up to Stoltz to get him to a preppy party that he's throwing so he and some friends can beat up Stoltz. How Eric deals with this situation makes up the remainder of the film.I think the parents were right on about Stoltz and this expensive gesture he was making. But I'm sure the attractiveness and capability of the players in this film were what the audience was watching instead of the stupid message that Some Kind Of Wonderful was giving out.

In fact, I am in the minority here judging by all the positive reviews that I felt I had to write a review to the contrary. SKOW has been compared as a reverse Pretty In Pink, of which it definitely is. Eric Stoltz plays Keith, a working-class guy who has a crush on a popular girl in school, Amanda Jones, played by Lea Thompson. His best friend Watts is a drummer/tomboy, played Mary Stuart Masterson, who secretly falls in love with Keith.The acting was good and there were some cute scenes. It was funny that Keith had made friends with the tough guys from the detention hall, a nod to The Breakfast Club. Thompson was sexy as Amanda, on the surface she seemed like the typical, shallow, popular high school princess, but toward the end she added a lot of depth to her character. Masterson was cute, sweet, and pretty. She had a wise intelligence that seemed to fit the personality of Watts. Stoltz was also good as the sensitive young artist Keith who longs for the unattainable Jones while seemingly not able or willing to see the true person who truly cares for him.I felt the ending was contrived. I have mixed feelings about SKOW. It recycles a lot of Hughes's previous storylines/characters working-class guy, best friend in love, antagonizing parents/teachers/siblings, high school hierarchy, smarmy rich boyfriend, rich vs. poor, etc., but of course, this was the Hughes style and he was the premier teen movie director of the 80s. Probably the scene between Thompson and Stoltz at the Hollywood Bowl was my favorite in the whole movie. It's funny, but I thought Watts and Keith were better off as friends, but that's just my opinion.While I definitely enjoyed Pretty In Pink more, despite being disappointed by that film as well, SKOW is worth watching if you are a John Hughes fan, but it wasn't one of my favorites.

True love's been under Eric Stoltz's nose the entire time, he just had to get over his infatuation with the popular girl first. And we've all been there; we've all wanted someone who was beyond our reach (especially in high school). That empathy is key here.

All of those elements make Some Kind Of Wonderful a great film that is John Hughes at his best.Some Kind Of Wonderful tells the story of Keith(Eric Stolz),a High School teenager who is a gas station employee and painter and has romantic feelings for Amanda Jones(Lea Thompson),a popular girl who goes out with her rich boyfriend Hardy Jenns(Craig Sheffer). With courage by his side Keith asks Amanda out on a date which doesn't sit well with Keith's tomboy best friend Watts(Mary Stuart Masterson)who starts to have feelings for Keith. Now,Keith has to deal with his friendship with Watts and his attraction to Amanda.Released in 1987,Some Kind Of Wonderful is a terrific and memorable Teen movie that was writer John Hughes' final film in the Teen/High School/Coming Of Age genre and maybe his most overlooked of the Teen movies he did from 1984 to 87 and is a movie that came out towards the end of the teen movie boom of the 1980s because by 1987 the Teen genre by 1987 and John Hughes' association with the genre had hit it's creative peak. Often seen as a gender reversed remake of earlier Teen classic Pretty In Pink(1986)and some will admit there is similarities between the two films(the same director and writer,love triangle,soundtracks and even the movie posters). At the same time there are minor differences between the two movies. And while Pretty In Pink is a great movie and a more iconic and well-known film I always preferred Some Kind Of Wonderful a movie that may not be very original but is one of the best Teen films of the 80s. Some Kind Of Wonderful is in my opinion not only a John Hughes classic but a Teen classic as well but unfortunately is often underrated and overlooked in comparison to The Breakfast Club,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Sixteen Candles,Pretty In Pink and Weird Science which is a shame because SKOW has all of the trademarks of those other filmsmemorable characters,great soundtrack and good dialog where everything just works. While none of the John Hughes regulars such as Molly Ringwald or Anthony Michael Hall appear in SKOW the Hughes style is still in effect with this movie. In SKOW we get some romance,drama and a little humor in the way Hughes did so well and the movie keeps your attention. The whole movie is basically a build-up to the last half hour of the film when Keith and Amanda go out on their date and what happens before that examining the relationships of the three main characters Keith,Watts and Amanda who in true John Hughes fashion are three dimensional characters and have depth. With Keith,Watts and Amanda we as a viewer have a connection with all of them as the three of them have to deal with love,relationships and dealing with their peers and classmates. As Hughes did with The Breakfast Club and Pretty In Pink SKOW deals with timeless themes and issues such as identity,different social groups as well as class struggle with rich vs poor among teenagers. The screenplay by John Hughes is terrific with memorable dialog that is strong,amazing and just makes the characters real and unforgettable. The ending of Some Kind Of Wonderful is amazing and classic John Hughes and is a truly effective and romantic and will viewers cheering at the screen. A fantastic ending.The cast is great. Eric Stolz is excellent as Keith,with Stolz bringing an emotional weight and depth to the role. Mary Stuart Masterson is brilliant,beautiful and gives the film's best performance as Watts,with Masterson being powerful and stealing every scene she's in. Lea Thompson is terrific and beautiful as Amanda,with Thompson being dramatic in the right places. Craig Sheffer is great as Hardy Jenns,Amanda's rich jerk boyfriend. John Ashton is wonderful as Cliff Nelson,Keith's Father. Elias Koteas is fantastic and funny as Duncan,a teenage punk. Maddie Corman(Laura Nelson),Molly Hagan(Shayne),Scott Coffey(Ray)and Lee Garlington(Gym Instructor)give good performances as well.The direction by Howard Deutch is simple,but great and effective,with Deutch sometimes moving the camera and bringing a nice pace and style to the film. Fine direction,Deutch.The score by Stephen Hague and John Musser is impressive,great and fits with the tone of the movie. Good score,Hague and Musser. There is also a soundtrack with some fantastic Pop/Rock songs that add to the film. A great soundtrack.In final word,if you love John Hughes or Teen Films,I highly suggest you see Some Kind Of Wonderful,an excellent,underrated Teen classic that is John Hughes at his best.

What makes this film so great is the combination of non-glossy actors, perfectly timed non-mainstream rock/pop music, and a grittiness that wasn't often seen in 80s romance teen films. Eric Stoltz portrays an A-typical male lead role, Keith, who was more cerebral than heartthrob. Mary Stuart Masterson stole the entire film with her brilliant portrayal of the tough, Tomboy best friend, Watts, who is actually very vulnerable and loving. Elias Koteas is particularly great as the juvenile delinquent who makes the end of the movie absolutely epic! I have to say that the music is just brilliantly done in this film, enhancing and complementing every single scene and eliciting the appropriate mood. Lastly, this film boasts what I believe to be the VERY BEST ON-SCREEN KISS EVER! Never before have I seen a more complex kiss; it manages to be awkward, romantic, and arousing all at the same time. "}{"Title":"Wonderful Love","Date":"21 January 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" The funny think about love is that it's never entirely a matter of our choice but that it chooses us.This is an under the radar gem that wasn't entirely overlooked but it's been kinda forgotten. This was the last teen film John Hughes wrote and believe it or not this is my second favorite in that sub category from John Hughes, and it's one of my favorite romance stories. The story isn't really anything new but it's really more in it's execution in which I personally feel they got everything right. The dialog as with most of Hughes films is great, there are a lot of memorable lines but most importantly it doesn't feel melodramatic like in most bad TV teen dramas that make me gag, but really feels like the kind of things a regular teen might say. Soundtrack is great, I love the song Always I want to be with you.Supporting character Amanda Jones played well by Lea Thompson this is probably my favorite role from her. I like that she doesn't play some stereotypical popular rich girl, in fact the interesting thing about her is that she's really in the same working class boat as Keith, Watts, and Duncan she just dresses up and makes herself seem like a upper class person just to get in with the in crowd.What I like is that you really feel for her character deep down she's really a lost person, we see her become disillusioned with the lifestyle from how her rich ex boyfriend Hardy mistreats her whom is a character I just want to punch. As well as how some others in that upper class treat others. These things I feel just show how just because your in the upper class doesn't mean everything is going to be wonderful or that your going to get everything.One moment that really sticks out for me was when she sees the portrait of herself that Keith painted and she then has a slight look of guilt because this portrait represents how he perceives her as a really beautiful wonderful person but she knows that she's not that person the Keith sees.Another supporting character Duccan played by Elias Koteas; his character along with his group of friends are awesome. I love the fact that he's a metal head I myself am into Heavy Metal music, a rebel, tough, rough around the edges but has a good heart all the same. Both Keith and him have a good back and forth. One scene for me that was a highlight was seeing Duncan and his friends save Keith in the party which is something real friends do.But of course the film is really driven by both the characters Keith (Eric Stolz) and Watts (Mary Stuart Matherson). Keith is great because his character is in a way kinda like myself in real life. He's a person that speaks softly, I'm not the talkative type myself; and when we talk it's because we have something significant to say. He's a artist, he loves to paint just as I love to write.Watts is just awesome and I'll admit kinda hot. She's feisty and fiery which are total turn ons for me. She a person that just likes to do her own thing and doesn't care about what other people think, from what she wears which is sort of a rocker/rebel outfit and how she acts is her way of saying, this is who I am whether you like it or not. She's also an artist as she plays the drums and likes to make her own music.I like that both really are the same in different ways, both of them are rebels. With Keith he's a silent rebel, on the passive aggressive side, he doesn't look to fight he really tries to solve conflict though reason but he will resort to physical resistance if he has to. Even like the moment in the party despite the situation getting bad where Hardy and his scum friends gang up on Keith about to give a beat down he doesn't bend. Watts is an aggressive rebel that puts it out there. I love that she's not afraid to admit to what she is. From how she dresses and the way she acts. I also love that she doesn't take crap from anyone or let Keith take crap. The chemistry between them is great, the thing about this story is that you already know the answer, the question is when. It makes perfect sense as both have more history together and are kinda the same.Watts you really feel pathos for because most of what she goes though is some of the stuff I've been though. See how she's aware that her feelings for Keith are more that just friendship alone which is perfectly natural because sometimes as times goes on if our feelings grow we begin to see our friend a lot differently. And how she's having trouble risking it all despite being a risk taker, they do say that the greatest risk is expressing your feelings. This just all the more makes us want her to do what she has to do and possibly win because it's the only way, not saying anything is even more painful.I really like how Keith is slowly discovering it, in his mind he thinks that Amanda could be the one; but we see slowly he's changing his mind a little and is starting to look at Watts differently.It has some great themes which are common in most of Hughes films like the importance of opening up to someone about how you feel, becoming more, our perception on people and how their not always what they seem, and believing in yourself.Sometimes the one we truly love is closer then we think.Rating 4 stars "},{"Title":"John Hughes Does It Again!","Date":"16 May 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" What does it seem that all teen comedies from the 80's have in common? Well, they were influenced in some way or the other by the legendary John Hughes. For this film, Some Kind of Wonderful, he penned the script. He wrote such a touching, heartfelt script and thankfully, that carried over to the final product. The film is heartfelt and earnest and is also a realistic take on high school romance. The film seems a little outdated, but if you strip away the layers, everything is the same no matter the year.Howard Deutch directed a romance film that takes a look of the high school's social hierarchy that one comes to assume. This is about some working-class kid named Keith who falls for the pretty Amanda Jones, despite her influences with the rich and popular. Meanwhile, his best friend is the tomboyish Watts who finds out she has feelings for Keith after he asks Amanda out.The acting is very good and believable. Lea Thompson is most likely the biggest star here and she does extremely well as Amanda, who tries to be with the rich and popular despite being poor. Eric Stoltz impressed me as Keith who is nice and laidback. Mary Stuart Masterson does a solid job as Watts and this is probably her best role.Overall, Some Kind of Wonderful is an 80's teen film that will keep you engaged. Despite several clichés, the film works because it has an emotional core with a strong script by Hughes and fantastic acting which makes the audience care strongly about what is going on. This is one of those films that makes me realize how great the 1980's were for film, especially with all these teen comedies. This is another great teen romance/comedy that we have all come to love. I rate this film 9/10.

He did write it and produced it. So he did have his hands in some of the most important parts of the filmmaking process.Now, I do go up against many a Hughes fan of the 80s teen gen films because everyone's favorites always seem to be either Pretty in Pink or The Breakfast Club &#x96; both good, notwithstanding &#x96; and sometimes they even mention the excellent Ferris Bueller's Day Off. But, Some Kind of Wonderful, was just that WONDERFUL, in every aspect. Music, acting, heart, dialogue, cast, comedy and romance. I viewed Pretty in Pink as a funny movie with a good heart &#x96; but not great. Breakfast Club was more about social commentary in the school. And Ferris&#x85;strictly comedy with a dash of drama.It was my sister who introduced me to this movie (and Dirty Dancing) in the 1980s and I simply can't thank her enough. It made me a lifelong fan of both Eric Stolz and Mary Stuart Masterson, though it's hard to see either in many more movies. I love the soundtrack from beginning to end, and it's one of the most listened to soundtracks in my life. And the dialogue (thank you, Mr. Hughes) is so good, I've used a lot of the lines multiple times in my life. Such as (paraphrasing) You can't judge a book by its cover&#x85;but you can tell how much it's gonna cost and I'm driving you crazy, and you're driving me crazy. And I'd rather not see you, and have you say good things about me, than see you and have you hate me. Cuz, I can't afford to have you hate me&#x85;Also, the romance was beautiful. Yeah, I understand the concepts in this movie are not entirely original, i.e. love triangle whereas one is completely blind to the one that loves him. But when the so-called secret is revealed, it's breathtaking. (Spoiler coming, sorry) And it doesn't hurt that the two who do get together all but walk off into the sunset (or is that moonlight?) leaving you believing this is forever. And that's my favorite type of ending where reality isn't at play. I really don't want to know what happens next. It's just enough for me to believe they'll make it after all.The opposite also works here in this movie; I LOVED the beginning. What I refer to as Watts at Play is a great intro She's playing the drums while the opening credits role and all the main characters are introduced. So well are both the drum solo by Watts (Masterson) and the first shots of the leads, that you really get a feeling of who's who and what status they play in both the high school they attend and in the movie as a hole. Brilliant.I'd like to believe the high school scenes hold up today, but its doubtful I would get others to agree with me, especially any young folk who would watch this for the first time in today's time. That's okay for several reasons it is, in fact, based in 1987 as Watts directly points out in one scene. So, if the movie were based in a one-room school in 1865, it's a poor argument to say it doesn't hold true today. Also, I feel the themes &#x96; rebels, outcast, shy, popular, stuck up, money, disobedience, nagging parents, gossip, detention, talking back&#x85;all still apply.Kids today. Whoa, let me continue&#x85;Kids today might be turned off by the dated nature of this film and I surely hope that doesn't happen. As I pointed out, I believe this to be as relevant today as it was 24 years ago.This is a simple movie of a boy, Keith (Stoltz) who is infatuated with taken Miss Amanda Jones (Lea Thompson) and is blind to the true love that's right in front of him. Also, it helps Keith's plight that Amanda's boyfriend, Hardy Jenns (Craig Sheffer &#x96; in a role I will forever and ONLY remember him in) is a cheatin' jerk. The story gets complicated with who's using who, who's loving who and who's supposed to be saving up for college. And there's a lot of room left over for extremely funny lines, comic tensions and deep insights into real people.I do like the script and the acting is pitch-perfect, even from the secondary roles &#x96; namely from Elias Koteas as, uh, Skinhead. Another role I will define him as in my mind &#x96; even though I've seen him elsewhere, such as the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film.But from all the things I loved about this film, such as the aforementioned great tunes, Watts (or Mary Stuart Masterson) is on my list of all-time favorite characters. She's tough yet insecure, hard though soft, smart but slacks, devoted however distant and both funny and sincere at the same time. She might have been overlooked for the Oscars or the casual viewer of this movie, but she steals every scene and shows the most depth of an already established fantastic cast. For someone 21 at the time, she acted her heart out and made an impact on me. Oh, and did I mention she plays a mean set of drums? I would love her in real life&#x85;and it helps, she does kinda look like a guy.I'm going to sum up the above with SEE IT. Don't miss one of the smaller Hughes (involved) films because everyone and their mother&#x85;wait, probably mostly their mothers&#x85;like Pretty in Pink more or think The Breakfast Club is superior. This 1980s relatively unknown film is a CLASSIC. "},{"Title":"Another great John Hughes treat.","Date":"25 January 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Ahh, 80's Lea Thompson. That'll do it for me, but I'll tell you more reasons to watch this love story. It might be perceived as more of a chick flick but it's not a typical one thanks to the acting and the master of teen angst John Hughes who wrote the screenplay. Stoltz isn't sappy and Thompson brings a lot of depth to a character usually played 2-dimensionally in movies. Masterson plays a tomboy to perfection but is sexy and emotional at the same time. Keith (Stoltz) has a chance to go out on a date with Amanda Jones (Thompson), the most popular girl in school, but the problem is that her ex-boyfriend is also the most popular guy in school and he happens to be a jealous jock. Sounds cliché? Not the way Craig Sheffer plays the jock. He's menacing and intimidating but Keith's way of taking it lightly and without caring is rarely seen in that type of situation. Oh yeah, and his best friend Watts (Masterson) is secretly in love with him. The acting is great in this movie and to be honest, I'm not sure why a lot of people haven't seen or heard of it. To me it's along the lines of Say Anything in terms of a good story and great and engaging acting. Elias Koteas' small part as the problematic high school student is a great one, too. Also, if you're a Back to the Future fan, it's fun to see Thompson and Stoltz together again after he got fired from BTTF.

While things are further complicated by the fact that Keith's best friend Watts is hopelessly in love with him, something that Keith is oblivious too. All roads, rocky or otherwise, are leading to one house party where lives are about to be changed.Released a year after Pretty In Pink, writer John Hughes further cemented his status as the king of teenage angst with this funny, charming and entertaining picture. Following a similar formula to that used in Pretty In Pink, Some Kind Of Wonderful deals not only in young love thematics, but also in opposites breaking down barriers, bullies and the spectre of parental pressure. Keith Eric Stoltz is from humble working class stock, the idea of dating the more affluent Amanda Lea Thompson would seem idiotic at best. The characters may move in different circles, but Hughes, as is his want, thrusts the issue to the front whilst dangling little strands in the background. Time is given to the father an impressive John Ashton and son axis, where career pressure is raised. And the delightful old chestnut of fitting in at school, or not as the case may be as regards Watts a tremendous and sensual Mary Stuart Masterton is also putting in an appearance.It's often forgotten in Hughes angsty films, that they aren't merely love stories for the young and restless. They are all encompassing pieces that hold up better than ever on revisits today. Yes there is pandering to certain expectations, and yes the endings never veer away from a tried and trusted method. But Hughes knew what worked for him and his audience. That he never attempted to insult us them with sledgehammer tactics, or trick of the twist dallying, is really rather refreshing when viewing them today.

Eric Stoltz character introduction is amazing...walking right up to a train, playing chicken on his own, and you can tell he is 100% not scared or threatened. He casually walks to the side of it just before it hits him, what a daring soul! Lea Thompson does her job, accurately, as the popular girl who wants to give this random nobody kid a chance because her last boyfriend was terrible to her. And by the way, Lea Thompson's super 80's suave ken doll of a boyfriend is one of the best characters in the movie! He is a d-bag to the extreme! The only other character who matches him in awesomeness is DUNCAN, the rebel punk rocker of the school, spending every day in detention, played by whoever that dude is that plays CASEY JONES in the Ninja Turtles movie! I'm sorry I'm talking about the characters so much but this movie is ALL in the characters. Mary Stuart as WATTS is the most adorable character in the movie! I haven't seen many people pull off the teen angsty, super-critical, talk crap about everyone personality like she does! It's so believable but it's so cute! And when she's sad you'll want to cry with her like a puppy.Solid direction and soundtrack. Plenty of interesting plot twists and turns to keep you intensely excited. And like i said, AMAZING characters! You even get to see Candace Cameron at about age 6 as the bookworm little sister! She's so smart. Definitely check this out if you like John Hughes, love stories, teen dramas, 80's era stuff, or if you just like straight up good movies! "}{"Title":"One of John Hughes' more underrated teen films","Date":"18 September 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Some Kind of Wonderful is one of John Hughes' lesser known teen films. Made in 1987, it turned out to be his last association with the teen genre before moving on to other areas of interest. Its a film that's never achieved the classic status of Hughes' other films of the time like Ferris Bueller's Day Off or The Breakfast Club. Even though I found it to be just as entertaining, and even rewarding.If you've ever seen Pretty in Pink, made the year previously, then you will notice some astonishing similarities. They both focus on a teenage love triangle. A high school misfit falls for a popular Senior while off to the side, a rebel who's friends with the misfit pines for them from afar. The only thing that differs is the ending. In PIP, misfit and popular Senior end up together. In SKOW, misfit ends up with rebel.Both films were written by John Hughes, and I think with SKOW, he got to make the film he originally envisioned. Hughes was allegedly unhappy with the way PIP ended. It was an ending that was forced upon him by the studio. I must admit I never really cared all that much for Pretty in Pink. The characters just weren't that interesting. Some Kind of Wonderful on the other hand is everything that film wasn't.The difference I think is all in the casting. Eric Stoltz offers a quiet but solid assessment of the part of Keith, the struggling artist who doesn't quite fit in at school. Lea Thompson plays with strength and depth as Amanda, the Prom Princess with issues of her own. And best of all is Mary Stewart Masterson as Watts, the non-conformist who longs for Keith in silence.Nobody quite makes a teen film like John Hughes. He has this ability to take generic material and infuse it with surprising depth and intelligence. And humour value too. When he moved on to adult films, he seemed quite out of his element. Probably because he seems a little awkward when trying to write them as anything other than stereotypes. The one exception was Planes, Trains & Automobiles, but that was down to the superbly nuanced acting of Steve Martin and especially John Candy.The adults in Hughes' teen films usually come off as alien, distant and uncomprehending of their children. Some Kind of Wonderful may be the one time where he gets that area right.Keith's father Cliff (John Ashton) wants his son to go off to college. I like the way he puts his point acrossYou could go on to a job where you don't have to wash your hands after a hard day's work.Keith would rather become an artist than have his life mapped out for him by his father. And when I saw SKOW the first time, I was expecting Hughes to fumble it, and turn Cliff into an indifferent monster. But I was surprised by Keith and Cliff's confrontation. Their heart-to-heart is quite well written on Hughes' part, and he allows both characters ample room to breathe. Cliff may be the closest thing to a sympathetic adult in a Hughes teen film.But its the young cast that make all the right moves. The central love triangle could be viewed as predictable, but the acting goes some way towards making Some Kind of Wonderful more entertaining than it has a right to be.Amanda could be regarded as a popular Ms Chic right at the top of the high school tree. And granted she only gets involved with Keith as a spur of the moment thing to spite her ex, but there are some depths to her character. She admits she makes bad decisions from time to time. But she would rather be with a gaggle of popular schoolgirls instead of feeling lonely all the time.But Watts is the one character to tune into. Mary Stewart Masterson does a great job fleshing out what's already a well written character. Her silent love for Keith is touching, and she's a walking voice of wisdom. Her curse is to see everything as it really is. She's so astute that its no wonder she's so alienated from everyone else around her at high school. Hughes may have trouble writing adult characters, but as for teenagers he's got them nailed.And there's a nice line of supporting characters too. I especially liked Laura, Keith's younger sister, played by Maddie Corman. Like Watts, she's astute and attuned to the world around her in ways most pre-teens only dream of. And I also liked Duncan, played by Elias Koteas. At first glance he seems a punk from detention, but becomes a surprisingly valued ally to Keith. Its all the more satisfying because I never saw it coming.Keith and Amanda's relationship hits a few bumps along the road. Too many as it turns out. Something that gets pointed out to them frequently. The ending is not all that unexpected, and it does come a little too abruptly, but I really enjoyed Some Kind of Wonderful. Its got a great cast of young actors and hits a lot of the right notes. It doesn't deserve obscurity. Its just as good as any of John Hughes' other teen films.A fine piece of work from a man who turned out some of the best teen movies the world had ever seen.

The whole John Hughes collection of teen comedies are classics of the time. They all were funny, insightful, but never false or preachy. I think that is what made them so appealing. This film had the misfortune of coming after Pretty in Pink, and yes has virtually the same plot. Rich snobby kids vs. average income kids. An outsider played by Eric Stotlz plays an outsider that Falls for a girl that is part of the Rich kid click, and of course she has a snob, rich obnoxious boyfriend that wants to beat him up.... Hughes movies were never great on plot, he took basic somewhat clichéd stories and made them fresh with good dialog and engaging actors. Stoltz gives a subtle intelligent performance, and Lea Thompson plays the snobby girl, but she is given the chance to be 3 dimensional, her performance is good. The movie truly belongs to Mary Stuart Masterson, she plays Stolz's best friend and confidant, and yes like Jon Cryer's character (duckie) in Pretty in Pink, she is in love with her best friend.She plays the character with the right mix of attitude and sensibility. The Duckie character in the other movie, was used more as comic relief. Masterson's character is more part of the story, and she makes the movie better because of it. This movie is entertaining because the characters are thoughtful and intelligent.

Teen-age themes were very rampant when WONDERFUL was made.  In my (humble) opinion, the thing that makes this movie most memorable is, not just the last few minutes, but the closing song.  After hearing it, I fell in love with the song and the scene.  It gave those last few minutes the oomph to put that smile on yer face and tear in yer eye.  It is a very fast, very Irish version of Can't Help Falling in Love With You by (not Elvis) but and Irish folk group called Lick the Tins(with the singer sounding very much like Melanie).  While in the UK, I picked up a copy of their CD and was disappointed that the rest of their didn't live up to my expectations.  Some one, working on the movie, had a good ear for picking out this gem and it is used to perfection.One odd note, mostly everyone I introduced to this song, loved it, especially kids.  Most of my Irish friends didn't see it as special, they said it sounded like every other Irish band.  (That must make Irish bands a great resource.)  Maybe I should get out more, but I consider it their loss.....One point of view I hadn't seen represented in other comments were those a gay friend mentioned to me.  It seems when he watches the movie, he assumes Watts' boyish character to be a male, not a female.  He watches it as a coming out film and said it was a common interpretation, by gays he knew, in a world where pop films didn't represent them adequately....

Where the other Hughes films before this tended to skim the surface of these issues, this film takes a deep plunge right into these issues, and works immensely well because of it.

I decided to research the movie here on IMDb and saw mostly good praise. The rating was average, but I was bored, so I thought, Oh, what the hell. Might as well give it a try! Plus the summary seemed interesting and invited me in.'A young tomboy, Watts, finds her feelings for her best friend, Keith, run deeper than just friendship when he gets a date with the most popular girl in school.' The summary makes it seem like the movie would be from Watts' point of view, but it wasn't. We only see glimpses of her 'agonizing' face every now and then when Keith's with Amanda. I was disappointed, since I was looking forward to see the whole movie from the tomboy's perspective. Instead, the movie focuses on Keith, which I wasn't very fond of. I think that I would have liked this movie more if it was focusing more on Watts.I didn't like the ending. (SPOILERS) I mean, when did Keith even realize that he liked Watts? It was too rushed! There wasn't enough development! Except for the hot little practice kiss they shared and that bar moment. Mhm. (/SPOILERS)I also didn't like the whole message that this movie gave. (SPOILERS) Keith used all the money that he and his father saved up for his future- his college!- for a pair of earrings for some girl. I mean, I found that pretty stupid. I'm not a love hater or anything, but seriously, I know the limits. (/SPOILERS)I'm aware that this is a pretty old film and many people find it popular, but this just wasn't my type. If you're like me, who is kind of cynical and doesn't necessarily believe that you MUST give up everything for love, then maybe you won't enjoy it that much either. But if you feel like giving it a try, then go on. The practice kiss that Watts and Keith shared was well worth the watch, anyway.

Unlike his better known films like The Breakfast Club and Ferris Bueller's Day Off this seems far more dated, it also doesn't help that the main character's behaviour towards the girl of his dreams is bordering on stalking.Eric Stoltz plays Keith, a high school student who is besotted by the beautiful Amanda Jones, played by Lea Thompson. She is already in a relationship though, with rich boy Hardy who treats her like his property. Early on Keith admires her from afar, sketching her during class and hanging around places she was likely to be, even deliberately getting himself in to detention after he overhears her being given detention. When Amanda finally has had enough of her boy friend Keith plucks up courage to ask her out. All the while Keith's closest friend, tomboy Watts played by Mary Stuart Masterson, is cautioning him that any involvement with Amanda will only lead to him getting hurt. This advice isn't entirely selfless as she has an obvious crush on him although he is oblivious to this.Claiming to want to show that there are no hard feelings Hardy invites Keith and Amanda to a party he is throwing. Even though Keith knows it is a trick he decides to go, but only after he has taking Amanda on a date where Watts acts as their driver. Of course the film ends with Keith successfully standing up to Hardy and ending up with the girl he is meant to be with.The acting is good enough although in common with most high school films the cast are a bit too old with most of them being closer to thirty than twenty let alone school age. Mary Stuart Masterson did well as Watts, my favourite character, although it is hard to believe that Keith didn't notice her as more than a friend; it is as if the creators thought a short hair cut and grungy clothes can make an obviously beautiful girl look plain and unattractive.While I think this film had a lot of faults I wouldn't advise everybody to avoid it, if you like high school romances and don't mind a bit of cheesiness you might really enjoy it.

It's only when it is unearthed by us the viewers, either at the video store or on T.V that we truly get a glimpse of this very entertaining and charming movie. Not a flop (by 80's teen angst film standards), but not an overwhelming success like it's predecessor, 'Pretty in pink', this film managed to generate a cult following.     Like 'Pretty in Pink' it is the story of a misunderstood youth (in this case Eric Stoltz, instead of Molly Ringwald) from the wrong side of the tracks who falls for someone who is, by their standards, unattainable. Both films star a disaffected friend who steals the show. In Pretty in Pink it was Jon Cryer's performance as Molly Ringwalds hopelessly infatuated friend Duckie, in Some Kind of Wonderful it is Mary Stuart Masterson's portrayal of Watt's, the tough, tomboy best-friend and secret admirer of our main character Keith.   As in Pretty In Pink, Keith manages to steal a date with his unattainable heroine, Amanda Jones. Asking her at the perfect time, when she is most vulnerable after a fight with her boyfriend, an egotistical rich-boy jerk played by Craig Scheffer. Whether it be shock, or a deep-seeded need to get revenge on her boyfriend, Amanda accepts, sending shockwaves through the ranks of their California high school.  By the last 15 minutes of the film we come to realize a few things, Keith is desperately trying to be his own person in lieu of his over bearing father, Amanda isn't sure of herself regardless of her popularity, and finally that Keith's best friend, who he see's only as a pal, is hopelessly in love with him but can't reveal her true feelings in fear of being rejected by the only person she can relate to.  In the end of our film Keith comes to a crossroads, stay with Amanda, the girl he has pawned after for his entire high school career, or be with Watt's, his best friend since grade school? Unlike Pretty in Pink Keith chooses the latter, and I believe this film to be superior to 'Pretty in Pink' because of that. In the original ending of Pretty in Pink Ringwald ends up with Cryer, but because of test audience reaction John Hughes decided to rewrite the ending to have Ringwald's character stay with Blaine, Andrew McCarthy's character. Much to my dismay as I really believed that she would end up with Duckie. 'Some Kind of Wonderful' fixes this problem without sacrificing anything emotionally from the story. You truly feel for this teenagers and identify with them in some way.    The ending was a breath of fresh air and was a great way to tie up an excellent film. I truly believe that this film, (along with 1989's 'Say Anything...', and 1986's 'At Close Range') is incredibly underrated and deserving of high praise. A great overall film.

It's one of those movies that, if I come across it while flipping channels, forget it - I'm hooked for the rest of the movie.As for the parallels some folks have drawn between SKOW and Pretty in Pink, please - SKOW is not only better than PIP, but significantly so.  It's funnier, more heart-warming, deeper, and just plain more entertaining.  The most significant difference, however, are the three leads.  Stoltz, Masterson, and Thompson clearly trump the trio of Ringwald, McCarthy, and Cryer (Cryer is excellent, though, and essentially steals every scene he's in).  In the battle of the red-heads, Stoltz is so much more likeable than Ringwald.  Thompson has more depth than McCarthy.  Masterson and Cryer are such different characters from each other that it's tough to draw any comparison.  Both good, but if I had to give it to one, it would have to be Masterson because she is so complex and her acting is terrific - portraying less of a caricature than Cryer's character.  Other than Cryer, PIP's only other strong point is James Spader as the unlikeable rich friend (although Annie Potts is not bad and the soundtrack is pretty good - gotta love Psychedelic Furs).  Craig Sheffer, however, gives him a run for his money as the same type of a-hole.  To top things off, SKOW has better peripheral characters.  Duncan just steals each scene he is in.  Watts' obsessed friend is equally hilarious in his limited role.  Keith's sister is perfect - both annoying and endearing.  Even Amanda's friends are sufficiently plastic and unlikeable to make thing work (I love the expression one of them gives at the end when one of Duncan's friends checks her out).Bottom line - SKOW stands high above PIP.In fact, without really thinking too hard - I would have to say that SKOW is among my top 5 movies in this genre.  The others?  Probably (in no particular order) Breakfast Club, Say Anything, Better Off Dead, St. Elmo's Fire.  I'm probably forgetting some other deserving, notable flicks, but SKOW compares favorably with any of these.

At least the accompanying synth-track Masterson drums to sounds eerily familiar to Wang Chung's equally masterful Wang Chung soundtrack, To Live And Die In LA. Other than that, no, there's no action, unless you count kissing. It's a reasonably intelligent relationship comedy/drama about loner-artist Eric Stoltz longing for pseudo-rich fantasy girl Lea Thompson--though, aside from her body, Thompson comes across as kind of creepy with her pre-adolescent boy's face; she certainly doesn't hold a candle to Masterson's sexy tomboy. Elias Koteas provides some humor as a punk criminal, there's tons of 80s music, and the characters all wear Miami Vice fashions to high school. On a realism level, it's a little weird when Stoltz's friends wish him as well as he's lured to the big rich-kid party where he's openly going to get stomped by a bunch of guys. Doesn't anybody care he's going to end up in a hospital? Masterson is the best actor of the movie's trio, and though her mannerisms often bring to mind a twitchy Sandy Dennis, nothing compares to the girl's close-ups. HOT! Personally, I think the flick would be brilliant if Stoltz appeared as Rocky Dennis, thus upping the emotional stakes in a sort of sequel to Mask.

I had just turned 19 and had finished high school only six or so months before. God this movie made an impact on me! I loved it! It is so total 80's. What does every U.S. kid in high school seem to want? He/She wants to fit in. To be accepted. Yet others in high school can be so cruel. John Hughes certainly knew how to get into the heart of an 80's American teenager.I could relate so much with Eric Stoltz's character (Keith Nelson) and with Mary Stuart Masterson's character (Watts). In high school, I had a female friend who hung around with me a lot and I had a huge crush on her. I never let her know of the crush for fear of losing her altogether. Also, I didn't live in the city where I went to school. That was basically like living on the other side of the tracks. To top it off, I even had my dad pushing me hard to go to college (which I did).One thing about seeing this movie on cable, DVD or VHS&#x85;it is not the same as seeing it in a movie theater with an audience. Elias Koteas as Duncan the skinhead steals all the scenes he is in and makes you laugh hard. That laughter was further amplified by everyone else who laughed in the movie theater. However, Mary Stuart Masterson's heart wrenching emotion transfers very well on both the big screen and on the silver screen. In my opinion, she was the true star of the movie.Over twenty years later, I still enjoy watching this movie and consider it one of my top ten favorites. I highly recommend it.

Hughes was in many ways the 1980's version of King Midas. Whatever teen comedy he was involved with the results was genuine gold. Every angst that was faced involving youth in the 1980's, Hughes knew the right key to give his audience full attention to what's going on and hope that the subliminal messages delivered to his films are easy to grasp at. It's sad that a man like John Hughes is no longer with us because he knew how to comprehend with teens, which others had tried, but didn't quite live up to the legacy of John Hughes.What makes Some Kind of Wonderful a special movie is that from the beginning of the story, we get a full satisfying glimpse of the characters without wasting a single moment at grabbing our attention. From Watts' (Mary Stuart Masterson) opening scene with her drumming, to Amanda (Lea Thompson) in a smooch fest with Hardy Jenns (Craig Shaffer), to introverted Keith Nelson (Eric Stoltz)dropping oil into a car. Those simple scenes are symbolic in a way to explain what faction each of these students belong to.Watts hangs out with Keith quite frequently. When Watts is not on her drum kit and when Keith's off work at the car shop, they're seen spending quality time talking casually. Keith and Watts join together in the loner's club. They're not from the upper realms of the crop. In fact if school was built like a layer cake, they would be at the bottom of the surface. Watts is a tomboy who's often condemned by her peers most to her boyish apparel. And Keith gets condemned mostly because of is job as an artist. In one of Keith and Watts' casual chats, Keith reveals that he is smitten over a classmate, Amanda. Watts has a total dislike for Amanda. Like Keith and Watts, Amanda is also from a poor family, but unlike Watts and Keith, she's the whipped topping among her classmates. Mostly because she's dating the rich, suave and smooth-talking teen Hardy. One day, after a bitter spat between Amanda and Hardy, Amanda breaks up with Hardy and was quick to respond to Keith when he asked her to go out. While Keith excitedly dresses up for his dream date, Amanda is at a crossroads; she can't seem to find the right way to tell Keith that she's not really interested in dating him because she doesn't want to bring herself down to the same layer as them.If school's not a problem for Keith, home is also quite trivial as well. His father has no other cares in the world except for his son continuing his education and keeping track of his college tuition. But Keith just wants to continue his studies in art which doesn't sit well with his father. This is the second film, Hughes and director Howard Deutch collaborated on (The first was Pretty in Pink). Many have claimed that there both very similar to each other. Though, they're mostly right with the exception of the ending to Pretty in Pink, it would have been the exact same movie. I always liked how John Hughes utilized music to connect the feelings of each of his characters. It's still in the traditional 1980's style flare, and who can forget the song Miss Amanda Jones by the March Violets.Eric Stoltz was simply amazing here as poor boy Keith Nelson, by making his role very real without being too preachy. The chemistry between him and the other two female stars will grab your attention at a tight focus. The one-liners by these characters will leave you in stitches in laughter. Even though you've left us too soon Mr. Hughes, your films, stories and humour will live on forever and for that reason alone we salute you John Hughes. There will never be another person like you.

Well it has to come pretty close to the amazing The Breakfast Club, anyway. The film is pretty much Pretty In Pink in reverse, but so much better. For one thing, we don't have Andrew McCarthy. And the ones we want to end up together, the ones who should end up together, do! Mary Stuart Masterson is wonderful as tomboy Watts, and she and Eric Stolz have great chemistry. And Samantha Jones, the goddess Samantha Jones (played by Lea Thompson) is actually a likable gal too. Not the one for our hero Keith, but Hughes doesn't paint her as a bitch. The bratpacker movie without the bratpack, this is a keeper.

Not that it was a great comedy, per se, but it was a very in depth look of teenager trying to understand themselves.Eric Stolze played an ordinary teenager, Keith of a middle class family who wanted to go after one of the most beautiful girl, played by Lea Thompson, in school. The problem was that she has an abusive boyfriend who was not happy about his pursuit, so the boyfriend was setting up a situation to humiliate him. Through the experience, the teenagers learned about themselves.Kudos to the writing of John Hughes. Great performance by Eric Stolze. Also especially great is the performance of Mary Stuart Masterson who played Keith's Tomboy sidekick who is helping him getting the girl while at the same time we know her crush on Keith without him knowing it.

I just read in imdb that John Hughes was furious when Ringwald turned down the role that Lea Thompson took on, but it was her loss and our gain. Lea definitely had a sexy edge that the homely Ringwald could never have pulled off. I've wondered what sort of sick fascination Hughes must have had with Ringwald to elevate a B-actress to star in three of his pictures, but fortunately I didn't have to see her in a fourth.SKOW would rank as my second favorite of the 80's teen angst films, behind Better Off Dead, which is probably more farce than dramedy, but masterful nonetheless. It noses out Can't Buy Me Love which was a similarly enjoyable film. This film was just beautifully acted. It worked for me, unlike Pretty in Pink, because Eric Stolz's character and his troubles seemed more real than Ringwald's. He actually seemed to hate school, instead of being the stereotypical poor kid who makes exceptional grades. Although many parallels can be drawn to Pretty in Pink, I felt it was more enjoyable that Stolz and Lea Thompson were both from lower/middle class families. It endeared me to Lea Thompson's character, because her struggles were not those of a petty rich girl. I also think the soundtrack was on the weak side, and they certainly should have promoted it better (I discovered it on VHS and don't remember it ever hitting the theatres). Maybe the trend of naming movies after popular songs plagued this one - the title seems like an afterthought that was slapped on when nothing else could be decided on.Bottomline watch this for the wonderful dynamics between Stolz and Masterson.

Hughes creates bright, appealing outcast kids (and he loves them), yet he situates them in the same old social position envious of the popular clique, they're always on the verge of crossing over...until they realize that being on the outside is just where they belong! It's the standard high school fantasy without an ounce of believability--and an ending that astounds one with its silliness.

Those two are very good friends, but Keith is clueless about his friend, Watts. In school he meets Amanda(Lea Thompson), a high class student who gets thrown around by her obnoxious boyfriend.

When Keith tried to woo Amanda with some very expensive earrings. he finds out who deserved them better, Watts. His true love. Love comes in strange ways.
