The cast and musical score are excellent and all of its jokes are funny and well placed. People say that the movie becomes what it is making fun of. Well, isn't that the idea? The movie is packed with about a billion logos appearing everywhere you look in the background, and a scene with an audience of cardboard cut-out celebrities. These are there to add to the atmosphere of the film. This movie is very strong, very well done, and has a real sense of humor. To top it off, it's led by a band with music that's so good you can't even tell they're not real. If you haven't seen it, go watch it. I'd recommend buying the soundtrack as well.

It is a purely fun film with a rocking soundtrack.Viewers who would most appreciate this would be the ones who have at least a vague memory of the television cartoon series because there are a lot of jokes and references that might go over one's head otherwise--not to say that kids wouldn't enjoy it as well, because they will.There's a lot going on in this film.  So much happens so fast, but that is intentional.  It is highly visual, and the style almost seems like a cross between Steven Soderbergh and Tim Burton, of course with a lot more pink and glitter.  The images literally pop out at you at times.  And while the plot is somewhat contrived, you might not mind too much because it speaks so clearly to our current culture.The parody of Boy Bands and Pop-Star Girls is dead-on and that's why this is such a guilty pleasure.  You can appreciate how they are made fun of and enjoy the characterizations at the same time.  And all the performances are first rate--from the cameo performances by Breckin Myer and Seth Green as members of the Boy Band Dujour, to leads Rachel Leigh Cook and Tara Reid as Josie and Melody, to the supporting players, particularly Alan Cumming and Parker Posey as the record executives.  Also look for cameos by Carson Daly and Ken Babyface Edmonds.Rosario Dawson as Valerie makes quite an impression.  Her strong but anxious portrayal helps set up the classic conflict of female friendship vs. diva-like fame--a conflict we've seen played out over and over again in many VH-1 Behind the Music episodes.All in all, this is a film you'll enjoy upon first viewing and maybe even more with repeated viewings.  If anything, you'll be dancing out of the aisles as you head home.

But it wasn't meant to be. I hate it when I hear critics slam a movie mainly because it doesn't fit into their favorite Type of movie. Some movies are made to sit through wincing - leaving you sore emotionally and some are light silly goofball creations that wont change the world, but sure are nice to just zone out with. This movie will never turn Roger Ebert's crank...its silly and goofy and irrelevant....Its also over time revealing itself to have been at the time...subversive. This movie has a lot of little things about it that are becoming more relevant as the years wear on... When this first came out I thought An alright movie with catchy songs This was before I myself got involved in the Music industry. After living through three bands and two contracts over ten years I would like to say this movie isn't as unrealistic as you may think. It is still a spoof, but close enough to reality to warrant another look. Originally waved away as being pure fluff I now find this movie creepily prophetic. Since this movie was made we have witnessed the fall out of bands like Back street boys the breakdown of pop-stars like Brittany Spears and a slew of young actors & actresses separated from family & friends whose entire personalities have been written and designed by stylists and are seen battling like some weird Fashionista roman gladiators under the tutelage of sycophants and managers.Media/pop culture, with its out of control emphasis on looks and weight over talent and personality, have resulted in actual government legislation regarding model weights and rampant anorexia amongst young starlets. Musically there has been a huge increase in management interference (listen to Pink's first album regarding the pressures placed on a young singer to conform to a label's Vision) dictating how the artists shall look and act. If it hadn't been for the internet download revolution of Lime wire and such I think the Music industry would have happily continued to control what consumers were ALLOWED to buy and ALLOWED to see...This movie was also made prior to the outing of gay boy band members Stephen Gately, Lance Bassit, Jordan Knight but the top selling song for the Boy Band Du Jour in this movie is the most homo-suggestive song I've ever heard. (Is it really called In Through Your Back Door?)After all this fallout, the world of Josie & the Pussycats seems much less stupid to me.Again...Not deep, but possibly prophetic...and fun to watch Just don't expect to feel moved. Its popcorn at its best - light and salty, not really a meal...its a snack and as that type of movie...shouldn't't be judged solely for its nutritional value...

He discovers a failing girl rock group in a small town and offers them a deal without hearing them. Within hours they have been styled and dressed by the label and are ready to cut their first record. Within a week they are number one, have screaming fans following them everywhere and have a strange desire to buy products that they had no previous interest in. However Josie starts to notice something strange about all of this and is soon asking more questions than the label would like her to.I hope my description above gives you an idea of the silly sense of humour that runs throughout this film because, although it could have been a sharp satire, it isn't quite as insightful as it could have been. Mostly this is down to the material - the targets are so easy (hell, pop music is practically a parody of itself in some regards) it is never sharp although it is pretty on-target for the most part. It doesn't help that the tone of the whole thing is that of a silly teen comedy rather than a satire and perhaps it was the strange mix of things that confused me a little bit and put me off it. Despite this though I still quite enjoyed it; it was amiable enough, was quite self-aware and was pretty funny at points. I can understand why many were put off it and it doesn't break any new ground but it is still pretty enjoyable and it was nice to see a teen movie actually try to do more than just pander to its audience (well, not much anyway).The actors involved give some clue that the material is up to something despite the weaknesses &#150; Parker Posey doesn't just turn out for every teen comedy that is around you know! The three leads are all pretty good &#150; delivering the silly mood but also being in on the joke and into it. Cook is probably the least fun of the three but she does well to carry the narrative. Reid is fun in a simple ditsy role that made me smile and Dawson is as gorgeous as ever while still delivering an enjoyable character. Cumming is a bit annoying and he adds to the silly mood with his overly daft performance. Posey is fun and somehow manages to be daft but still effective in the role. The support are mostly in on the joke and the star cameos send themselves up well &#150; Carson Daley and Levy particularly. Biggest surprise was that I liked Missy Pyle &#150; normally she is terrible but here she works.Overall this is a strange mix of pop satire and teen movie. This produces a rather silly tone, which may put some off, not helped by the fact that the easy targets do rather take the edge off the material somewhat but for my money it was refreshing to see this try to do what it did. I enjoyed the humour and the fact that the cast were all into it and, although it is not a great movie I would certainly watch it again.

I really didn't have many expectations for this film...all I was looking for was a fun movie that wouldn't make me cringe (too much.) Well, without hesitation I can say this movie totally blew me away. It was by far one of the funniest movies I've seen in a LONG time. Sure, it was campy, but it garnered genuine and consistent laughs from the audience. It's been a long time since I've seen a movie with such energy and well-balanced pacing.All three actresses were fantastic as the Pussycats, staying very true to their comic book/tv characters. Rachel Leigh Cook was an excellent choice for Josie...she adds a poignancy to the role that was completely unexpected. As you can imagine, there is the usual romantic subplot, but Cook gives it an honesty and sweetness that saved it from becoming a cliche. Rosario Dawson also did a wonderful job of humanizing Val, portraying her as a strong yet insecure woman. Tara Reid had the hardest part of all. How do you portray a ditzy character so that it doesn't degenerate into a one-note gag? Answer Make the character endearing. Reid did a wonderful job at making Melody's sappy optimism and absent-mindedness absolutely adorable. In less capable hands, some of the gags would have fallen flat...but they got me smiling, and even laughing.The soundtrack utterly rocks...the last teen movie I can think of with a soundtrack that was so well matched to the visuals was Clueless. Songs that could have been just filler really added to the overall energy and appeal of the film. The music style was more hard rock than the original TV series, but they managed to get the theme song in there somewhere, so I was happy. ) At the screening I went to, people actually danced in the aisles during the end credits...not something I see every day. ^_^The script is phenomenal, filled with many in-jokes and great timely references. What's most amazing is that Josie & the Pussycats is a movie with something to say, yet it got its message across in a witty and entertaining way while avoiding being too preachy.I can honestly say Josie & The Pussycats is one of the best TV-to-Film adaptations I've ever seen--very enjoyable for fans of the old series, but remaining accessible for those who weren't.

Well, maybe 2 hours when you consider the extras I watched. With low expectations going in, I actually like this film a lot. It is jerkin! (See the film, one of the subliminal messages, along with colors, food products, shoes, and of course the band itself.) Josie and the Pussycats is a product of Archie Comics.The back story is the need for record producer (Parker Posey) to find a new group, any group, simply as a carrier for their marketing messages. The group doesn't need to be very good, and this one isn't. Rachael leigh Cook is excellent as Josie, the lead singer, and Tara Reid is funny as the ditzy drummer of the group. (As an aside, they all were taught to play their instruments during performances so they look natural, even though professional playing and singing were over dubbed.)Well, eventually the smart Josie figures out the scheme and foils it. They give a real, unencumbered concert performance, she gets the boy she wanted all the time. The whole film spoofs product placement and the recording industry that takes unknowns and through hype, molds them into hit groups for the profit of the handlers.  Sort of like the current TV series American Pop Idol where a winner will be selected in a few weeks.Josie and the Pussycats is a well-made and entertaining film, if one just watches it for what it is.

They are mocked by fellow students, despite being quite talented. No has discovered them, its true, but things can change. A deceptive and evil record producer needs new blood and orders an underling to find some fresh faces. Naturally, Josie's group practically falls into his lap. They are signed and touted everywhere. But, is this the real thing or is the mother of all exploitation plots being hatched? Will Josie and the girls stay sweet and unjaded by their fame? What a fine and fun film this is! Girls will love it, yes, and the guys will love the chance to see three beautiful gals on celluloid. Tara Reid is very, very funny as the slightly dense rocker and Cook is a joy as the talented and pretty leader of the group. Parker Posey and Alan Cummings are terrific as the evil music executives and they appear to be having a ball oozing bad vibes. The costumes, needless to say, are just what a fashion loving female would admire. There is a love story, too, for those who beg for tale of romance. Then, too, the three young rock stars are very good role models for the younger set. Ladies, whatever your age, try to spend a bit of time with Josie and company. The laughs are infectious while the sweetness-versus-evil plot is guaranteed to provide a venue to help you forget your worries and make you smile, smile, smile.

When one boy band starts to get integrity, (Notice Showbiz Integrity) their manager arranges a little missing persons affair and darn it; if that doesn't push record sales to a new high.Apart from that the story of the Pussycats has limited appeal and trying to make the three girls into absolute types was very predictable in this kind of movie but to make everything so startingly wholesome at the same time is not very entertaining. Even the people who are supposed to be the bad guys seem to have stumbled into a do what I think is best for the cause trip.The three Pussycats are of course very hot but the dilemma they are placed in is all too cute to be appealing for boys. Teenage girls will probably also get bored with the substandard machinations of the plot so who is left? No easy answer here. Maybe people who are very bored or People Who Need People. You decide.

Enter Josie and the Pussycats, a small band who wants to make it to the big top. When they are discovered by Wyatt, they give in and become big rock stars. But will they find out that they are just pawns for the record industry or will fame take them over......Cruelly overlooked on initial release, this film is a damning satire on product placement, which manages to fit placement into almost every scene. It kind of defeats the purpose, but its intentionally hilarious.It's camp from beginning to end, and I can imagine that many on here have given it a low rating because they are ashamed to admit this film is rather good, but hey, life's too short, and its a lively fun movie, that doesn't hurt with the fact that Leigh Cooke is beautiful to look at and makes the film really easy on the eye.Read between the lines of the film, it really does stick a big middle finger up to teens and manufactured bands who clog up media attention one minute, and disappear next.It's very topical, and I for one feel that this movie should be shown to teenagers between the ages of 13 to 18, to be used as a warning that these boy bands, girl groups are just there to make you buy lots of poorly made goods at stupid prices.Actually, this film is probably based on true events.Hilarious and probably kryptonite to Simon Cowell.

Alan Cumming's character Wyatt Flemming is sent to a small town to find the next band, where he stumbles across Josie and the Pussy Cats. On the surface the Josie and the Pussy Cats are selling CD's. But, Josie and the Pussycats don't realize that there music label has loaded their songs with subliminal messages; which is used to sell a lifestyle.When I watched the movie last week, I totally got it, as the movie parodied the boy/girl bands of the 1990s. We should not forget that the sound of the groups are (heavily) processed. Everything from the dance moves to facial movements are well choreographed. Also, these bands were in the business of selling the latest fads. Groups such as N*Sync, Backstreet Boys, and Spice Girls were selling an assortment of items such i.e. soft drinks. It is amazing that the movie managed to pick up on the little things that sells a manufactured pop group.My favorite scene of of the movie, when Wyatt Flemming stopped his mini van at the traffic lights, then Josie and the Pussycats walked in front of his car; then they paused. Then Meat Loaf's Paradise by the Dashboard Light cued. Whilst the song was playing, Wyatt removes a CD from its cover then he frames the girls inside of the cover. Behind Josie and the Pussycats, a sign stated, World's number 1 Band. Wyatt looks towards the camera mounted on the passenger side and he smiles. All those years ago, I did not realized what I missed on. But lucky for me I caught the movie last week, and I enjoyed it. It parodied the manufactured pop groups of the 1990's.

I'm sure there are plenty of early teenage girls who will watch this film and just enjoy the girly-rawk music, and the romance and triumph of the goodies over the baddies. The grown ups out there will get a lot more than they bargained for. JATP is a great satire on the fickleness of the modern music world and how it feeds on and feeds up the fads of todays teens. From the branded hotel rooms through to the merciless killing off of any musician who catches on to the plot, it mocks modern life in such a gentle way that many people don't even realize what it's doing. Even the anti-climactical ending seems to sort of fit - Fiona's big plan to brainwash the youth of America to like her is so absurd it's hysterical.The pussycats themselves are pretty good - there's a real chemistry there between the girls that's lovely to watch. It makes you wish that you'd had friends like that when you were their age. However, for me, the show is stolen away by DuJour. Although their appearances are only brief, they summed up everything that is wrong and right about the pop industry today. And I can't believe they got 'back door lover' past the censors.

Films like this one, a satire directed at the record industry, consumerism and the capitalist system in general, tend to inspire me with a similar cynicism. I am generally suspicious of anti-materialist or anti-capitalist satire emanating from Hollywood, an institution which lives and dies by free-market principles and which is always readier to preach the virtues of thrift, frugality and glad poverty than to practise them. Whenever film-makers rail against Big Business, there is generally a good business reason for them to do so. Josie and the Pussycats started life as a strip cartoon published by Archie comics. I can't say that I'm really familiar with it, but I do recall the television cartoon from my childhood in the seventies. It was about an all-female rock band made up of three girls with contrasting hair colours and equally contrasting personalities, Josie (vocalist/guitarist, redhead, sensible and practical), Valerie (tambourine, brunette, headstrong) and  Melody (drums, blonde, sweet- natured but a bit dumb). This film is loosely based upon the comics and the cartoons. The basic idea is that a corrupt record label, MegaRecords, is brainwashing teenagers to buy their records, and many other products as well, by putting subliminal messages under the music. If any of the musicians discover what MegaRecords are up to, they have to be disposed of. In the opening scenes we see Wyatt Frame, a MegaRecords executive, arranging for the members of Du Jour, the label's biggest boy band, to meet their deaths in a plane crash because they have started asking too many awkward questions. This, however, leaves Wyatt with a problem; MegaRecords now need a new group to replace Du Jour. In the small town of Riverdale Wyatt finds a hitherto unsuccessful girl band, the Pussycats, persuades them to accept a lucrative record deal, and propels their first single to the top of the charts. Which leaves just one question. What will happen when the Pussycats discover (and, of course, they invariably will) just what Wyatt and his boss Fiona are up to? Satire, in the cinema or in any other medium, needs something more than just a target to attack. The film never generates a lot of humour, and the characters are all pretty unmemorable. Neither Josie nor Valerie emerges as a well-defined personality. There is some attempt to make Melody a simple-minded airhead like she was in the cartoons, a characterisation owing something to popular prejudices about blondes (and possibly also to pop music's prejudices about drummers). In the cartoon, however, Melody may have been a dumb blonde, but she also had a lovable sweetness about her, something that does not really come over in Tara Reid's interpretation. Reid, in fact, struck me as miscast; she is several years older than her co-stars Rachael Leigh Cook and Rosario Dawson, and I felt that the film would have worked better with a younger Melody, playing her as a naively innocent teenager as opposed to the more worldly twenty-something Josie and Valerie. Several other characters from the cartoon, such as the Pussycats' laid- back upper-class manager Alexander, his obnoxious sister Alexandra and Josie's boyfriend Alan are imported into the film, but they all play minor supporting roles and it is clear that they are only there because fans of the original would have been disappointed had they been omitted. (And whatever happened to Alexandra's cat Sebastian?) Wyatt is a very one-dimensional character, an effete long-haired fop who speaks in the sort of fruity upper-class British accent that the British upper classes largely abandoned several decades ago. Worse, though, than the film's poor characterisation and the low standard of its humour, is its hypocrisy. Two big Hollywood giants like MGM and Universal are not really in a position to start throwing stones at the record industry or anyone else when it comes to accusations of manipulating public opinion or subliminal advertising, especially in these days when film studios and record labels are often part of the same commercial conglomerates. The blatantly obvious product placement with which the film is littered was probably intended as an ironic in- joke, but to my mind it tended to undermine the film's ostensibly anti- consumerist message. I said earlier in this review that protesting against greed, acquisitiveness and the materialism of the capitalist system is a great way to make money. Except in the case of Josie and the Pussycats it wasn't. The film actually made a loss at the box office, possibly because its target audience were more aware than the film-makers hoped of the essential contradiction in its position. Or possibly because it's just not a very good film. The moral of the story is not so much Don't trust what the capitalists tell you as Don't trust what anyone in the entertainment business tells you- even when they're telling you not to trust what someone else in the same business tells you! 4/10 "},{"Title":"Not at all bad","Date":"19 March 2012","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Music","Review":" You might expect Josie And The Pussycats, a live action adaptation of the comic and cartoon series about an all-girl pop group, to be fairly bad, but you'd be wrong.

About the only criticism I can make of Josie and the Pussycats is that much of the humor is at the expense of teenagers and youth culture, so it's more enjoyable the older you are.Based on the old Archie comic book about a three-girl rock band, this film quickly sweeps them out of Riverdale and into a fairly sharp tongued spoof of the music industry and American consumerism. There's Josie (Rachael Leigh Cook), the leader of the band who's never sure she's really good enough to be a rock star. There's Val (Rosario Dawson), who's more confident on the outside but is worried about falling into Josie's shadow. And then there's Melody (Tara Reid), the spirited ditz with a sunny disposition.Wyatt Frame (Alan Cumming) is the record label executive who latches onto the Pussycats as the vehicle for the schemes of his nefarious boss Fiona (Parker Posey). They put subliminal messages in the Pussycats' songs to make teenagers buy all that crap they don't need. Fiona and Wyatt also subliminally brainwash Josie into becoming a diva and ditching her two best friends. Add in Alexander Cabot (Paulo Costanzo), the putative manager of Josie and the group, his obnoxious and skunk-haired sister Alexandra (Missy Pyle) and Alan M. (Gabriel Mann), the sexiest boy in Riverdale and Josie's secret crush, and you've got the makings of a movie that's like a cross between a shallower Legally Blonde and a faster Austin Powers International Man of Mystery.Now, there's nothing at all here to be taken seriously and the film does barrage the viewer with music video-style montages and the most intentionally obtrusive product placement in movie history, but it's all part of Josie and the Pussycats' veritable charm.

However, just the fact that Rachel Cook's character ended-up saying all the main points plainly to her friends had made the messages a lot less credible. A movie's supposed to carry the messages within the plot, Mr. Director!!! Not say them in plain Enlish in case the audience didn't quite understand them, heh. However, the acting here was far beyond my expectations. The creativity, though very primitive and misleading, was outstanding. The jokes, however, were so ridiculous that I couldn't help but laugh, whether in pity or not. So, if you're looking for a movie that will confuse you to the point where you feel like you're looking at a Picasso painting, and you do end up with a lot of colors and good music in your head, then check it out. It will give you a good night's sleep at best.

One film that falls into this category is Josie and the Pussycats.

Oh, and there's the teeny-weeny problem of a constant barrage of product placement shoved in our faces throughout the film.

Posters showed the three girls vamping for the camera with an easily forgettable tagline. The color scheme was retrospective to the comic book, but on large posters looked amazingly foul. Purple and green is nice and retro, but the combination of the three girls, a strange filter, and that color scheme turned off potential viewers by the boatload. The marketing campaign seemed to be centered on one key idea these girls have tight clothing and they wear them. It would be a nice enough concept if television hadn't moved to this format years ago. You get more sex with The Man Show, and it's free. Aside from the sex, the marketing campaign made it appear that Josie and the Pussycats didn't seem like it had much more to offer.This is all the more surprising given the fact that Josie and the Pussycats is one of the more clever comedies released in the last few years. The film certainly had a sexual element to it, but it's hardly the largest aspect of the film. This likely upset viewers who went to the film hoping to see Rachel Leigh Cook naked. If the theatre I went to was any indication, the few goofballs who showed up for a dose of soft-core porn left angry and upset... and confused. Josie and the Pussycats was a very clever comedy, although the humor isn't exactly tough to get. Perhaps if you are sitting in the theatre waiting for someone's pants to come down you lose the ability to see humor.Josie and the Pussycats stars Rachel Leigh Cook (AntiTrust, She's All That), Tara Reid (American Pie), and Rosario Dawson (He Got Game) as the three band members reprising the 60's/70's comic book of the same name. There was also a pair of animated Josie and the Pussycats films in the early 70's, which careful viewers will notice the current film pays homage to... even the 1972 Josie and the Pussycats in Space. The film also stars Alan Cumming as the evil record producer, Parker Posey as the evil (and insane) record executive, and Seth Green as Travis, member of Boy Band DuJour.The movie falls into a strange place in current film genres. It's certainly a comedy, but it's nothing like current American comedies. Josie and the Pussycats is clearly meant to be a satire of pop culture, but it doesn't let the message get in the way of simply being entertaining. The humor is at times smart, at times dry, at times obviously silly. But the film doesn't overdo any particular style of comedy, and does a good job with mixing it up. But in almost every case, the film's humor often with a second meaning that takes some thinking to catch onto... and usually makes the joke far funnier.The film opens with a parody of the boy band craze, this time introducing DuJour and a large crowd of screaming and excited female (and sensitive male) fans. Getting out of a limo and onto their private DuJour jet, they launch into pop song, Back Door Lover. Despite the fairly obvious double entendre and commentary on the entire boy band concept, the joke seemed to fly right over the head of the majority of the audience. Boarding their plane they find it overly crammed with product placement... you see more Target logos inside the small cabin than you see inside the actual department store. Humor based on product placement is an ongoing gag, almost to the point where you stop noticing the giant Bayer logos in the final scenes. Product placement is even more clever than you first suspect... the products being shilled often correspond to action taking place on the screen. Shot of an ocean? Ads for Tide are shown. Heads being driven into the ground? Bayer logos are shown. Subtle humor, but you begin to respect the fact that some thought clearly went into the writing. That can hardly be said for other recent comedies.Josie and the Pussycats gives us a very 80's happy ending, but it fits with the rest of the film. You won't be laughing hard, but if you paid attention and allowed yourself to just have fun the film will feel worthwhile. Josie and the Pussycats isn't likely to hold up well over time, so it's best to see the movie while the references are still fresh and highly amusing. Comments about MTV, Starbucks, and boy band references won't be nearly as funny in ten years when (with any luck) all three have completely vanished from the face of the earth.It isn't brain surgery, but at least the film understands that fact and when you're not paying attention slips in some clever humor.

Some of my regular readers have objected to the use of that term. Nested self similarity would be better, I suppose as on of the types in a larger analysis of self-reference.These are films , for instance whose moral is bluntly to avoid being superficial and formulaic, but which themselves are superficial and formulaic. Here we have a film that preaches the evils of using media to sucker kids, and whose primary visual feature is product and logo placement. But the thing is done in conspiracy with the teen/preteen audience; but rather than parody or even sharp satire, we get an attitude of; `sure it's superficial but its fun.' That's troubling, and it completely undercuts our appreciation of the growing self-referential sophistication of the young audience.On the other hand, we've seen a flood of movies based on comics recently.

The film Pussycats aren't very much like the cartoon and comic Pussycats, except that Melody is still blonde and ditsy and Alexandra catty (sorry). Alan was adorable as a male dumb blonde but I can't remember if he was that way in the comics. The movie rocked &#150; I even missed Coronation Street to catch the ending. It's very enjoyable for adults like me who are young at heart and the truly young. I wish more movies like Josie had been around when I was a little kid. I like the message being given that conformity and expensive clothes don't make people happy. And yet, two things struck me as highly ironic the first was that this movie is coming out of Archie comics, the same company that gave the world the ultimate manufactured band (Sugar Sugar was recorded by session musicians and credited to the Archies after the Monkees rebelled and refused to sing it). The second was that I liked how the script poked fun at marketing by excessively promoting products and showing how record companies and the government are trying to control teenagers (and pre-teens?) by placing subliminal messages in pop music that tells the kids to go out and buy the latest fad. Ultimately though the film is having it both ways all the products and TV shows (Viacom's channels got plugged a lot) will stay in the audience's minds after the outtakes roll. Perhaps since Hard's Day Night making fun of the industry is now part of pop music and rock movies make the kids laugh and feel they're putting a finger up to the companies that want them to buy their products &#150; while they're buying the products. I notice that the soundtrack to Josie did very well. Oh well, at least the movie is true to the comics in the way that it's sweet and ultimately wholesome.

Well, at Least The Satire Was Having a Good Year","Date":"27 August 2009","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Music","Review":" To make a comedy, is a good way to entertain. But when you put something serious into the comic mix while remaining entertaining, so that's close to perfect.Despite the goofy looks of this movie, the fact that there were no big stars to support it, and even its reputation as a financial flop; it's a very good movie indeed. The comedy was fine, and the performance (including, believe it or not, Tara Reid) was wonderful ! The final hurly-burly wasn't a real hurly-burly as it should be, but it managed to be all good. The most important thing of it was its message about the modern pop culture. That will make it live longer than any shallow teen comedy. And it was totally conspicuous for me to find out that not one but three works aimed at the same issue, in the same time, by almost the same viewpoint !On 25 February 2001 an episode of (The Simpsons) titled (New Kids on the Blecch) was aired, involved Bart and his friends joining a boy band. While watching a video for the Party Posse, Lisa notices the phrase Yvan Eht Nioj being repeated continuously by belly-dancers. She plays the video in reverse and finds that it means Join the Navy. Also, an Uncle Sam I Want You poster can be seen in the video frame by frame. The joke was that the United States sends subliminal messages in order to recruit people!Strangely, or not, at the same year, right on 11 April 2001, we got (Josie and the Pussycats), where large secret organization advertises anything some businessmen produce by inserting subliminal messages through low tracks mixed in underneath other louder tracks in innocent girl band's songs to influence the listeners' actions, mainly the teenagers, to just consume very trivial goods. It confirmed so comically that the modern pop culture aims at making us stupid petty creatures with no consciousness and no thinking at all (I loved the way how anyone starts to think has to be kidnapped immediately as the peak of the movie's hilarious paranoia). On 29 June 2001 (Pootie Tang) was released to nearly say the same, but through a spoof of a superstar. Aside from his imbecile mentality and idiot songs, his sexual charisma brings him all  money, fame and companies that want to exploit that to the utmost. As you see, the star became a commodity more than an artist. So it's wholly a game of marketing, not art anymore.Thus, art or media became only a way to affect meanly, or accurately a cat's-paw that big parties (the government, the huge corporations, whatever..) manipulate capably to control the ever surrendering recipient, to plunder their consciousness, so their freedom, transforming the whole process into mass hypnosis or ultimate scheme. It's all the way about the blind acceptation, the absence of thinking (or the critical mind) and the insistence of the pop culture to be nothing but dull, trite and vapid.It's great that in simple comedies you find satirical messages as important as this. It is how the pop recovers itself and comes to its senses. And when 3 works in one year say the same, I won't think that their makers turned all into conspiracy theory's freaks ! But rather the term No smoke without fire will come to mind, or maybe the word believable. "},{"Title":"More villains!

If it's too good to be true, then there is a catch. What it might cost you may be a price you don't want to pay.This movie, based on the Archie Comics and the 1970s cartoon series, updates Josie and the music of her all-girl group, The Pussycats. In light of the success of Lilith Fair and the introduction of Women of Rock magazine, Josie & the Pussycats should have been a winner at the box office. Unfortunately, harsh criticism from the media shot the movie down.I've taken classes in public relations and advertising and earned a communications degree. Most of the advertising came straight out of my textbooks and deserved to be spoofed. Unfortunately, the jokes wear thin. They are easily overlooked after multiple viewings. The critics made it a point to harp on this point. They were wrong not to take a deeper look into what makes this movie tick.The heart of the story is found in the friendship shared by Josie, Mel and Val. Anyone who has shared a pack of Ramen Noodles with friends will be friends for life, for they have endured hard times together.As for the music... wow. Songs like Three Small Words and Spin Around should have gotten plenty of radio airplay. Compared to the real world offerings from girls like Madonna, Britney, Christina and their peers, Josie & the Pussycats bring something to the table, both lyrically and sonically. Kudos to the songwriting team. To borrow from Jim Steinman Someone must have blessed us when they gave us those songs.For anyone who has dreamt of rock 'n roll glory, this movie is for you. Josie & the Pussycats is proof that a Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy can make Rock 'n' Roll Dreams Come Thru.Music fans looking for a double feature should watch Almost Famous followed by Josie & the Pussycats.

If that isn't enough to have the warning sirens on, it was in live action.Josie and the Pussycats is also live, but works far better than it really should - Josie, Valerie and Melody are at the centre of a satirical comedy, but the people who also gave us Can't Hardly Wait and The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas wisely decide to not send up the characters, instead settling for poking fun at pop culture. (Like that's so hard.) But Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont do it with such affection and so amusingly that it's hard not to go along, although the running product placement gags make me hope the BBC doesn't buy this for terrestrial viewings (24 recently began its second day and BBC2 snipped out the Ford references from the first episode)...Aspiring band the Pussycats - Rachael Leigh Cook's Josie, Rosario Dawson's Valerie and Tara Reid's Melody (and Tara Reid IS Melody, even if it's only the lack of Okay lady I love you bye-bye! that stops you wondering if she's actually playing Mindy from Animaniacs) - are discovered by mysterious British svengali Alan Cumming, who whisks them from Riverdale to the big time with their manager Alexander, Josie's close friend Alan M - less hunky than in the comics or even the cartoon - and Alexander's sister Alexandra (I'm here because I was in the comic book). They soon become huge stars - Think Christina Aguilera times three except one's incredibly tan, or TLC with two white chicks - but is there a hidden agenda? Of course there is (and it has to be said that The Simpsons did something similar in one-third of the time). In truthful, it's not particularly edgy, but the movie's energy, gags, music and entertainment quotient more than make up for it, with Cumming, Parker Posey and the title trio standouts. Screw cynicism, Josie and the Pussycats is almost as much fun as Rock'N'Roll High School, and infinitely superior to the Hanna-Barbera incarnation. And yes, they do play the theme from the cartoon over the credits.P.S. Look out during the first command centre scene for an indication of what the makers felt about reaction to Can't Hardly Wait.

But curiosity got the better of me, and I ran across it one night on some premium movie channel or another while I was channel surfing.I wish I had kept on channel surfing that night.Though I do admit, there were some things of the movie I liked. Four of the songs, and some parts WERE funny-Alexandra being asked why she's there, and her responding with because I was in the comic book. (I love jokes like this!)-The band meeting in the Starbucks ladies room. I *loved* how Val got Alex out of there. Anybody have change for a tampon? I'll be outside. (something like that. That's one way of getting a guy out of the girl's room!)I thought the idea was good, though. Putting subliminal messages into music to sell not only the music, but products as well (orange is the new pink!) I told my sister, as a joke, Hey! Now we know why all those Boy Bands are so popular! (my sister and I were in our teens during the whole Boy Band craze, but we never really followed the crowds on them. To this day, I still don't like Boy Band music). Actually, this movie inspired me to write a story, but that's beside the point.Now, for what I hated about the movieThe Language. I'm one of those weird people who can not stand swearing. I can take it in small doses, but usually, comedies rated PG-13 have swear words coming out the wazoo. I also hated all those sexual innuendos. It's like nobody can make a movie these days that does not have sex jokes somewhere in it.Melody got kind of annoying fast. Sure, she was a dumb blonde in the cartoon, but in this movie, she was a complete airhead. She wasn't this stupid in the cartoon series (can you tell I like the cartoon a lot better than this movie?) Valerie also had an attitude problem that I couldn't really picture her having. What did they do that for? To make her more interesting? And Josie was . . . . . well, just Josie.You could not take one single look at anything in this movie without seeing a product placement. Yes, I realize it was a parody. Yes, I realize you can't take this movie seriously. But it was a 90 minute commercial.Sebastian! What happened to Sebastian?! You remember Sebastian, don't you? Alexandra's pet cat? The band's mascot with the Muttley-esquire snicker? The one who got Josie and the gang out of the messes they got themselves into in the cartoon? How can you have the Pussycats, without their black and white snickering Pussycat mascot?! What, they couldn't find a black cat with white feet to be Sebastian? Or was a computer generated Sebastian (complete with snicker) just not in the budget? Either way, this ticked me off big time!Alan, Alex, and Alexandra. What happened to them? I hated the way Alan was portrayed, a shy, dumb blonde. I can't see that from Alan. They did not cast him very well, either. He needed to be more muscular. And what was with Alan M? I know that was in the original comic, and I have to ask what was with that there, too. But that didn't bother me much. I never really cared for Alan, anyway.Alex and Alexandra, on the other hand, is a different story. They were barely in this movie, and that ticked me off because Alex and Alexandra (and Sebastian the cat for that matter) are my favorite characters in the cartoon. Actually, I think the only character in this movie that was true to form was Alexandra, little screen time that she had. I think she was the only character that was actually IN character!I absolutely hated when Fiona and Wyatt tried to turn Josie against Valerie and Melody. That really bugged me. I don't know why it bugged me, but it just bugged me. Was that trip really necessary? I never liked the Best Friend Turns on Best Friend angle (I guess it's because it reminds me of my high school years).In defense of the plot, it was an interesting idea, but I felt it was poorly executed. They could have made it more like the original cartoon. The gang (all six of 'em!) could find out what Wyatt and Fiona are up to, get caught, and it would be up to Sebastian to bail them out of the mess they had landed in, and maybe wreck Fiona and Wyatt's plans while he was at it. "},{"Title":"Three Small Words Not That Good","Date":"31 May 2010","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Music","Review":" Josie and the Pussycats is a film that a lot of people understandably avoided upon its release. Not only was it surrounded by the unpleasant controversy of equally unpleasant Archie Comics completely screwing over their most famous artist of over 40 years -- who was reasonably outraged of their unauthorised usage of a character based off his wife -- but it was also very clearly a desperate attempt to cash in on characters that had not featured prominently in any popular media for years.Entertainment does move in cycles, and it shouldn't be surprising to anyone that, in the squeaky-clean teenybop year of 2001, that one of the original squeaky-clean teenybop groups would attempt to stage a comeback. Archie Comics as a company are well-known for attempting to exploit any and every possible trend or fad, and they can't really be blamed for that. However, the real-world events behind the film completely ruin its attempted message.Essentially, the message of the film attempts to convey exploitative corporate (and governmental) evils. It's impossible to take it on its own, however, despite the directors' clear attempt to make the characters and circumstances their own it's a film attempting to take the moral high ground on the topic of corporate evil, made possible by a company that at the time was committing one of its most grievous corporate evils. Because of that alone, the film is undermined before it even begins.There are some amusing moments and some satire that works in the film. The acting isn't too terrible for the most part, although there are some truly shameful performances in it, and by that I mean career lows. I can't imagine most of the cast would happily recall Josie and the Pussycats as a film they were too proud of making. Between the mediocre-to-bad songs, the self-aware attempts at humour that almost always try too hard, and terrible miscasting in places, it's difficult to feel much affection for the film.Even for fans of the comic (Josie hadn't had a regular series of her own in nearly 20 years when this film was released), the film couldn't help but be a disappointment the actors barely resemble the characters they're intended to be, such as the skinny Alan M. who is a mousy, terribly untalented folk singer. While his looks don't thrill, he also doesn't have a personality to make up for it. What happened to Alan M. the muscular blond roadie? What about the Cabots, longtime best enemies of Josie and her gang? They didn't even pop in Pepper for a cameo.The worst thing about the film is that it really didn't know what it wanted to be or who it wanted to appeal to as an audience. People who already knew Josie and the Pussycats would be insulted by the 'interpretation' of the characters, which were far off-base and barely included any of the memorable cast from DeCarlo's comics. People unfamiliar with them would either not be interested in a superficially teenybopper film or put off by the heavy-handed attempt at satire which simply falls flat more times than not. Was it a romance, a satire, a parody, a comedy, a chick flick, a friendship movie, a romance...what? It's all over the map, and not in a way that respectably combines themes to form a stronger whole. In this film, Josie and the Pussycats could have been replaced by anyone, and nobody would have noticed the difference.Of course, it also didn't help that by 2001, even the most popular girl group in years, the Spice Girls, had largely faded off the map and gone their separate ways. By 2001, people of all ages were growing tired of the sentiment embraced by the film Pussycats; they wanted a break.While the intentions of the film might have been honourable in questioning corporate endorsements and government roles in popular media and entertainment, the film itself was not realised as well as it could have -- and should have -- been. Surrounded by the controversy of the nastiness of its own corporate master, Josie and the Pussycats is an exercise in irony more than anything else, and on so many levels. For a film that makes such fun of pre-fabricated pop music and artificial groomed 'instant celebrities', it certainly tries to dole out those very things, which is regrettably hypocritical. So it fails even as a commentary, even if taken on its own merits, apart from Archie Comics and their machinations. It's not very funny, it's not that interesting, it's nothing that hasn't been done before, it's not subtle, the music isn't very good, the acting isn't that great, the casting is terrible, and well...it isn't Josie and the Pussycats at all.

It's not surprising that they struck out again with this virtually unwatchable pop culture satire/nauseating teen-bopper flick.It's starts off with a bang, spoofing the whole boy band craze with Seth Green, Donald Faison and Breckin Meyer (who are all recycled cast members from Can't Hardly Wait) all part of a group called DeJour.  The way they show them flaunting themselves and the millions of annoying girls melting at their knees, screaming their lungs out, hits the target dead-on.  Now that's good satire.The rest of the stuff, involving product placement, subliminal messages and incoming fads becomes preachy and heavy-handed.  It even assists the film in wandering into one-joke territory.  Only sporadically did I laugh at the often pitiful attempts at satire.  I understand what this film is trying to prove!  Pop culture can be used for fraudulent purposes!  Music managers can screw you over!  Bands have a good tendency to break up, with the lead singer starting a solo career!  Product placement can go too far!  These are all good ideas for satire.  But it all lies in the execution.  In this case, the execution is very poor.  All the satirical jabs are delivered in a forceful fashion.  The actors would've been better off reading their lines off cue cards.  Maybe if it were handled by a better team of writers and directors, with a better sense of intelligence and wit this could've been much more effective.  A bunch of ditsy teen girls screaming out, Pink is cool!  Pink is the new red! is not funny.  It's annoying.  But, as it turns out, the film is just as shallow and one-note as their previous disaster Can't Hardly Wait, only hiding behind a slick, satirical facade.Tara Reid's character is totally annoying.  She plays the stereotypical dumb blonde.  Her job is to ape around and say mindless things.  Even retarded characters have to be handled with a certain sense of self-awareness.  Even the characters of Bill and Ted, though simple-minded, weren't saying stupid things on account of stupid writing.  They were saying stupid things on account of witty writing.  But Tara saying, Wouldn't it be cool if I can REALLY be in two places at the same time? and running around the house like a fool saying, I can be in the bedroom and the kitchen and so on and so on--that is just plain stupid!  I think the whole dumb blonde gag is one that has been done to death.  And unless it's handled very delicately, the gag can fail miserably and sometimes even make you wanna gag.  Alan Cumming is amusing as the sleazy manager.  He's one of the few cast members to breathe life into this bland comedy.  He's a fine actor and breathes more life into almost anything he does.  He brings a touch of professionalism into this otherwise sloppy, amateurish work.  Cumming brings in a couple of the sporadic laughs I had while watching the film.  Also keep your eyes peeled (if you still decide to see this movie) for the great Eugene Levy, who has an amusing cameo.  Eugene's the man!  Rosario Dawson is a fine actress, who unfortunately doesn't always pick the best scripts.  She starred in the awfully overrated Kids and the cliched urban drama Light It Up and now this?  Rosario, you're a good, attractive actress.  Make better career decisions.And of course, we couldn't do without that predictable romantic subplot, in which the guy has a hots for a girl--in this case Josie (Rachael Leigh Cook)--and just doesn't know how to tell her.  We know EXACTLY how it's all gonna progress and how it's all gonna end up, so why the hell are you even bothering us with this schmaltzy crap?!!!  And why is it that the guy who has a crush on the girl is often brutally handsome.  As if the girl hasn't jumped on his bones the whole time they've known each other?

Nonetheless Josie McCoy (played by the petite Rachael Leigh Cook) and her accompanying kitties - bassist Valerie Brown (Rosario Dawson) and drummer Melody Valentine (Tara Reid) - exceed and entertain to a surprising attempt.Neither playing it straight or going all out goofy, Josie and the Pussycats fortuitously creates a wacky world, which plays both into the caper ridden stories of the cartoon, as well as manages to deliver a malleable story accessible for kids of all ages (including those in their mid-life crisis). Fleshed out through a mix of deadpan and silly humour, coupled with some successfully intuitive restraint the cartoon adaptation comes of witty and affable, a far cry from the forced idiocies of their counterparts.Superficially (and somewhat hypocritically) touching on issues of the current era of commercial brainwashing and pop culture, Josie and the Pussycats become superstars as part of a dastardly marketing scheme. Within the framework of a story, which is undoubtedly predictable to the fullest, the characters molded with the script are wickedly pleasurable. This especially goes for the ridiculous boy band foursome DuJour, played to hilarious effect by Donald Faison, Breckin Meyer, Seth Green and Alexander Martin, whose brief outings are the crème de la crème of the whole movie. Equally satisfying are Alan Cumming as the devious band manager Wyatt Frame and Parker Posey as despicable me record label mogul Fiona. An additional shout-out has to go however to Tara Reid, who gets the stereotype of an idiotic blonde bombshell to a T, delivering one of the funniest performances I can think of.Given the strength at the back Rachel Leigh Cook and Rosario Dawson come off a bit stale, given their more set and conventional personaes, as if hijacked by the more wackier character deliveries. All in all, despite the generic storytelling and some plodding delivery, Josie and the Pussycats turns out to be an unexpected ounce of cartoonesque satisfaction, albeit not anything that comes off as timeless or memorable.

The characters very much resembled their cartoon show characters very well. I'm comparing the movie to the cartoon show since I've never read the comic book. Alan's relationship with Josie was just as awkward as always. His oblivious reactions to Josie's feelings are timeless. I was somewhat disappointed I didn't see the cat mascot, but I imagine that would have required some computer animated cat. The plot is fairly straight forward. An evil record label puts subliminal messages in their music, and when a certain boy band starts asking questions, they disappear. The boy band is promptly replaced by Josie and the Pussycats. The villains of the story were delightfully cheesy. Fiona has a bad habit of thinking out loud, a problem that's quite contagious among comic book villains, and Wyatt's poor planning is hilarious to watch. Overall, if you're a fan of the comic or the cartoon show, watch it. If not, it'll seem like just another movie.

A very underrated movie, for people with very strange, and unique sense of humor.The movie follows the Pussycats as they go from a garage band playing gigs in bowling alley lanes to near superstar status playing in a stadium. The girls are discovered by a plotting record exec and offered a deal to good to refuse. Unfortunately not all is what it seems and the machinations of Fiona, the head exec, threaten the Pussycats friendship. To top it off Fiona has been using the girls to brainwash consumers. The plot, like the entire movie is absurd, but the movie is completely aware of it. As I mentioned earlier this movie in no way takes itself serious, and there a ton of in-jokes that might be missed the first time around. Although I've rarely seen the actual Josie and The Pussycats cartoon, I have to say this is a great big screen adaption, especially for a cheezy (which is not always bad) cartoon.The Du Jour songs are hilarious, just listen closely to the words, cracks me up.

It's a very insightful take on MTV these days and how trends are created. Another strong point is those two catchy tunes Pretend to be Nice and Three Long Days. These three sound good enough (are they actually making the music themselves? who knows) that they could actually make a convincing band of their own, if they were to quit acting. But they don't have to quit acting, specifically Rachel Leigh Cook, she's a pretty good girl-next-door type and was a good fit on the part.     The whole plot, however, veers into childness rediculousness pretty much 20 minutes in. Allen Cumming's character Wyatt Fenner, the record producer, and Parker Posey Fiona Apple, her boss, hit some wrong notes and do little to add to the movie as their producers and villains. Unfortunately, while those good bits of dry humor are still there, the overall story of the movie gets worse and worse to the point, until the very end where I feel like I'm watching an episode on Nickelodeon or something.

As it is, the actresses in those parts were hardly spotlighters or scene-stealers, so why bother limiting yourself there?Melody's attempt at stupidity got a bit tiresome after this viewing (still like her trying to be everywhere at once tho), and Josie got one laugh from me when she was trying to get the machine out of the studio.It seems clear that Alan Cumming and Parker Posey were originally cast as Alexander and Alexandra Cabot. I had heard Parker Posey was to be Alexandra as a matter of fact. Either the parts got too far out there or they ran out of good guys (truthfully, going up against Cumming and Posey, it seems likely that they overshadowed the Pussycats trio, something that wasn't wanted, so more low key performers for the Cabots were needed, and Posey and Cumming became separate bad guys). I was mostly glad to see Alan M., Alexandra and Alexander receive some sort of recognition, no matter how minute. They were in the cartoon as well (interesting that Alexandra said she was in the comic book, when it was the cartoon that made the characters. If they were going to refer to the comic book, why not put Pepper, Sheldon or Clyde Didit in the movie?).I really hated the loss of character #7, Sebastian. Just once I would have loved to see Alexandra talking to a black-and-white cat. Missi Pyle pulled off all the failures of Alexandra perfectly. Songwise, it was still cute. I bought the soundtrack and there are actually some good songs there, about as good as the songs in the cartoon. They will be nostalgically remembered, that's for sure. The whole advertising joke will also be a clincher for this movie, as viewers try to recall all those products. I think Du Jour will also have opinions for decades to come as well, not sure what. Maybe what was really being said by the Back Door Lover song?The movie must have failed because of marketing. Was it a girl flick, a satire? I don't think it was clear and I don't think the makers were clear what they were after either, and it showed. They seemed to want whatever audience they could get and missed out.Scooby Doo, on the other hand, relied solely on the cartoon, didn't change a thing (not even the color schemes) and, like the Brady Bunch movie, totally recognized the flaws and complaints and got a winner and a sequel.I don't think Josie the cartoon had too many complaints, but I just wanted to see Josie in blue, Melody in green, Valerie in purple and Alexandra in red in the movie. the Pussycats outfit scheme did come close toward the end of the film, but never achieved it.Still, like Scooby Doo, it is an interesting transition of a comic book and cartoon to watch take place.

Good mindless fun. Writer/Director team Harry Elfont and Debrah Kaplan have taken the Archie comic book and subsequent cartoon (which I had never heard of) and instead of merely making a movie version have transplanted those characters into a biting satire of the contemporary music scene and consumer driven teenage culture. I was not impressed with their first movie, 'Can't Hardly Wait', but here they pretty much hit the nail on the head. If CHW was a teen movie, then this is an anti-teen movie.`Josie and the Pussycats'  takes a slanted, really quite daring look at the current pop music scene blatantly populated with manufactured groups, style over substance and advertising over talent. More then look at it, it gives us a hilarious explanation for it. While the movie isn't high art or filled with profound symbolism it raises many good points and blatantly beats you over the head with them. The movie's observations are pointed and rather sharp if you think about it. The entire premise is based on a teenager's fertile minds being easily brainwashed which is about the only thing that could explain most teen fads. They are actually playing into the very system they think they are rebelling against. Well, it's just about true - the true art of great satire (reminiscent of but completely different to 'Dr. Strangelove' and other greats of the genera). Somebody had to say it. The movie does this none to subtly and even at that people still don't get it. Any review that complains about the overabundance of product placement in this movie was written by someone who didn't get it or outright rejected the idea.   Elfont and Kaplan's characters are inflated to cartoonish proportions with the cast, particularly the fantastic Alan Cumming and Parker Posey (they own this movie), willing to indulge in it's exaggerated whims. When the movie opens we see the fans of pop group Dejour (an absolutely hilarious ensemble including Seth Green and Brecken Myer) - crying, screaming and worshipping the group like brainwashed cult followers. The intro is terrific and it's a good thing to because the first few minutes we actually spend with the Pussycats the movie is pretty bad. Blame it on Tara Reid or whoever wrote her awful lines. But once our Pussycats are discovered and are instantly signed (as it seems real bands are, sometimes) the movie takes off and flies fluidly until it's exuberant end.  Many of the jokes are current-event stuff that are already out of date. In one lengthy scene we are constantly winked at (or beaten over the head with) an in-joke that Tara Reid and Carson Daily were dating at the time. However, much of it's themes and broader references stick while the jokey-jokes dissolve over time. If the movie were made now the exact same philosophies could apply. It would probably say something like Hillary Duff is the new Britany Spears. If it were made a few years from now it will say who the new Hillary Duff is and so on. The music industry will always be shallow and teenagers will always frantically jump from one fad to the next (and bands will always go down in plane crashes). The larger themes are timeless. The biggest problem with the movie is that Kaplan and Elfont want to have it both ways. At times the movie is adult, smart and over the heads of kids, and at other times is sticks out with humor so juvenile and silly that it seems to only be aiming at the younger crowds. It's hard to tell if the writers want to satirize teens to their faces or get the crowd before they become logo-hungry teenagers. This creates some awkward shifts in the movies tone that it doesn't juggle very well. We get the sense that it was rushed. It's no surprise however that most of the best lines happen to always be in the vicinity of Cumming and Posey. It's also very well made for it's apparent low budget. Might be a cult classic. The director's visual style is eye-catching, like a 90 minute music video (in a good way). The songs within the movie are nearly perfect parodies - catchy, tuneful and fun in their own right, but also so fundamentally simple and stupid in their lyrics that it's almost hard to tell them from anything from Britany Spears or any other real attempt at music. One of the best teen/self-referential movies in a while and will probably stay that way for a while to come. No other writing team will be jumping at the chance to skew it's own audience as coldly as this one does. Look for Eugene Levy in a very funny little cameo.Lights!

When I saw Du Jour and heard their subversivly wicked song, I realised just how twisted the film was, and decided I had to see it.  So I borrowed it from a seven year old.  Her step-dad assures me that she doesn't understand the subversive or sexual undertones of the film.The acting is ... acting.  I mean they're playing characters from a comic book that is a light comic book.  The leads were likeable and pretty and had the traits I expected for their characters.  Wyatt and Fiona were fun as the campy villains.  And the guys who played DuJour were great (they could perform that song with a -er- straight face.)The digs at pop culture were struck with pinpoint accuracy.  The over the top (and unpaid) product placement drove the point home.  But despite this, the movie works at a more basic level for children who won't understand some of the twisted humour bits.  It reminds me of the 1960's Batman show - a childrens' adventure story and an adult comedy wrapped up in one.The story, and its ending, were very Josie.  And the music was catchy.

They take a boy band and crash their plane in hopes to get rid of killing them (I don't know why, but who cares). They then find the next best thing--Josie, Valerie and Melody, three small town girls in a rock group who just tries to get it big. This record company--let's just call it sub music--finds them in the middle of a street, without auditions or anything (OK, it's very farfetched and silly, but you really weren't expecting the Godfather, were you?) and sign them up without auditions or anything. In the end, in case you haven't predicted it already, the girls find out the truth, they have been cheated just to get their music to sell.

I figured it would be a shallow but  pleasant farce with maybe a decent  concert sequence.And like lots of other folks, I was  surprised to discover there was more to it.   The Pussycats' search for a respectable  venue becomes a nearly fatal encounter  with an evil recording company that deals  in both music and mind control.  The farce  turns out to be spiced with a satire on  the manipulativeness of the entertainment  industry, the plight of teens who choose  to run with the crowd rather than  thinking for themselves, and the struggle  to maintain one's identity and integrity  in the face of pressure and temptation.   (I was also surprised that VH1 and MTV  allowed themselves to be shown in such  a negative light.)Unlike lots of other folks, however, I  wondered if there was even more to it  than that.  I felt there was something  almost Orwellian and Faustian in the mix.   In fact, I went so far as to speculate  that JOSIE might be a darker, more bitter  comedy masquerading as farce.-- something  along the lines of THE MAGIC CHRISTIAN or  even DR. STRANGELOVE.But the Backstage Pass documentary,  included on the DVD, took care of that  theory.  Light-hearted farce was, indeed,  the intention -- which left me feeling that  the additional depth was both a virtue and  a flaw.  JOSIE went beyond simple-minded  satire, but frustrated me by not going  further.Okay, I realize it isn't fair to criticize  a movie -- or any creative endeavor -- for  not being what it was never intended to be.   But if a movie hints at intentions it  ultimately doesn't have, well that's  rather frustrating.JOSIE does, however, have the expected  concert sequence, and in case you were  wondering, Rachael Leigh Cook, Tara  Reid, and Rosario Dawson are actually  playing those instruments.

The Pussycats are a struggling rock band from a small town called Riverdale.  One day, they manage to strike a deal with a shady producer named Wyatt Frame (Alan Cumming) and his equally shady boss, Fiona (Parker Posey).  Not long after, the group is on the road to pop fame.  But quickly after, Josie and her group uncover a plot to brainwash America's youth through subliminal messages that have been carefully planted in their music.  The messages in case you want to know, often encourage kids to give into mass consumerism, causing them to spend countless amounts of money on junk, which will be worthless in a week, thus causing them to give into a newer trend.The acting here is pretty good, considering what this movie this.  This movie does somewhat follow the cheesy 70's cartoon, but not by much.  I really did have very low expectations for this movie, you know.  I had only wanted to watch this movie just to check out Rosario Dawson (hot!), but I had instead found a little gem of a film.  Make no mistake, she is a total babe, but still if you want the truth, I've been waiting for a movie like this to be made for years.  A movie that is totally ridiculous and entertaining at the same time while still making fun of something that I truly hate.  First of all, it is very hard to hate this movie without overlooking the blatant satire of the pop industry.  As much as I wanted to hate this movie (believe me I really did want to hate this movie), I couldn't.  Then I began to see why I could not hate this movie.  It was becoming more and more clear to me that this movie is actually making fun of my least favorite music genre - pop music.  (I am a fan of rap/hip-hop, R & B and some metal, so you can see that my hatred is natural).  But still, it also pokes fun at how fake some of these people are when obsessed fans are not drooling over them or are not kissing Carson Daly's a** on TRL, as this is made clear in the first ten minutes of the movie with a popular boy band named Dujour.I personally believe that had this movie really wanted to make fun of the pop industry, they would have featured appearances by well-known music artists, probably those outside the genre of pop music.  A cameo appearance by Will Smith or Jonathan Davis (the lead singer of metal band Korn) or even Eminem would have made the message crystal clear Pop sucks!  Even so, an appearance by one of those teeny-boppers themselves would have lent a little more credibility to this movie.   You also cannot ignore this movie's message about the decline of decent music in today's society.  Thank you to the teenyboppers, like Britney Spears and (especially) her ex-boyfriend, Justin Timberlake.  But you also can't help but realize that people seem to be wising up to this teeny-bopper trend, since it is pretty easy to point out some things about them, one thing being Britney's obviously dissolving fan base (maybe after this year she will no longer be known as the Princess of Pop) or Justin's venomous insults to his former love.  Things are not looking so hot for Christina Aguilera either, who since the release of her new album, Stripped, has made numerous, scantily clad appearances in magazines and on T.V.  (I say hot because many people are beginning to believe that she is no longer the innocent, little Genie she was three years ago; plus she ranked very high on Entertainment Weekly's Skank-o-Meter last month).All in all, I did thoroughly enjoy myself (much to my own disgust) and this is a film that you should watch if you hate pop music.True, this movie will look seriously dated in about five years, so it's best to check it out now, while there is still something to laugh at.

I expected nothing, actually, as live action adaptations of cartoons had proved themselves to be the lowest of all film subgenres.But the writers of Josie and the Pussycats took the unenviable task of adapting a second rate and all but forgotten Archie spin off and created a smart and witty satire on post millenial pop culture that reminds one less of the Scooby Doo movie and more of Frank Tashlin's Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?  Basically reducing the entire pop marketing machine to a hideous sublminal brainwashing operation, the movie is filled with hilariously over the top product placements in a joke that seems to have gone flying over the heads of self righteous adolescents everywhere.  The satire isn't always subtle (the subliminal message tacked on to the Pussycats' single, voiced by mr moviefone, includes the phrase 'there is no such place as area 51') but it is almost always pretty funny.  But the film does a credible job of creating a shiny, brightly colored, and vaguely menacing pop culture fantasy world, where everyone is beautiful and every surface is selling something.As expected, the trio is played by adorable pseudo teen hotties (Rachel Leigh Cook, Rosario Dawson, and Tara Reid), of which only Rosario Dawson rises above the passable in terms of acting.  There is a fairly gratuitous cameo by Carson Daly, then Reid's fiancee, that could have been cut out, although on second thought it is kind of funny to see Daly (playing himself, no less) as a smiling, blank faced contract killer.  The real stars here are the ever dependable Parker Posey and Alan Cumming, as the ruthless and grotesque record company executives, who provide most of the film's funniest scenes.

I don't think this film has much to do with the original concept, at least plotwise.Secondly, although the many (and I mean MANY) jokey product placements were funny and often clever, THEY ARE STILL PRODUCT PLACEMENTS.

Rosario Dawson's character was kind of lacking however; basically all she did was stand around and look pretty.  But that's alright.

I found the Melody character (Tara Reid of 'American Pie') to be tiresome and unamusing, and Parker Posey, who I have loved in movies like 'Waiting For Guffman' and 'The House Of Yes', to be a total disappointment, but the rest of the cast did well. Former child star Rachel Leigh Cook ('Get Carter') is fine as Josie, Alan Cumming ('Circle Of Friends') is a hoot as the cliched evil camp Brit, and the cameos from Seth Green ('Buffy The Vampire Slayer') and Breckin Meyer ('Go') as half of boy band Du Jour were hysterical. The real plus for me is the gorgeous Rosario Dawson, who I recognized from 'Kids'. She's a major babe with lots of charisma who I'm hoping will become the new Pam Grier!

They represented about 65% of the humor in the entire film.  The other 35% must be credited to the Pussycats.

I have been a Josie fan since I was a little girl, so the movie was a dream come true.Josie, Valerie, and Melody are 3 best friends from Riverdale (a bit of creative license, since they actually reside in the town of Midvale) who make up a band called the Pussycats.  They dream of fortune and fame as they scrape by with gigs wherever they can be had, like at the local bowling alley.  One day, they are discovered by music manager Wyatt Frame and are swept up in a whirlwind of sudden popularity and adoration.  The shiny apple has a major worm in it, however the Pussycats discover that they are pawns in the record company's grand scheme to brainwash the youth of America with subliminal messages planted in the music.  When the top brass at the record company learn that the Pussycats are suspicious of their scheme, they conspire to break the group apart, promoting Josie as a solo act and disposing of Valerie and Melody.  Will Josie choose solo success, or will she stay true to her friends, even if it means that they may never again see the heights to which they ascended?The movie has much more substance than the lot of mindless teen gross-out flicks that had been so popular until recently.  It's a hilarious send-up of the boy band phenomenon (the videos by fictional boy band DuJour are a scream), the Josie comic book, and the marketing of products in general. The main message of the movie is to reinforce the concept of free will. If you buy into something, be it a tangible (clothes, soda, music CDs) or intangible (an idea, a philosophy) product, do it because you want to, not because someone says that you should.  It's basically the not giving into peer pressure and the be true to yourself arguments.I know, the Pussycats aren't in their trademark cat outfits (did this also account for the lack of box office?), you don't hear familiar songs from the show like Inside Outside Upside Down, and Alan M. could have used a little more muscle on him, but don't let that stop you from seeing Josie and the Pussycats.  It's a fun and funny jab at today's trend-obsessed society.

I guess a film about a show about 3 female detectives is ok, but one about 3 female musicians is a terrible idea.  Whatever, Josie and the Pussycats is from the same writing and directing team that made the highly underrated Can't Hardly Wait so I was willing to give it a shot.  The film has high aspiriations but only connects with a few of them.Among other things, the film strives to be a fun narrative about the band, a social commentary, and a showcase of fun pop songs.  Unfortunately the narrative is weak, the commentary only hits in a few spots, and the songs are mostly bland, save the one played over the opening credits.  We're left with likeable mush, not really a good film, but not an altogether bad one either.The 'Cats are Josie (Rachel Leigh Cook), Val (Rosario Dawson), and Melody (Tara Reid), a Riverdale garage band who stumbles into a record deal with Parker Posey's Mega Records.  The catch is this company has been using subliminal messages in pop music to brainwash kids into wasting money in the most worthless capitalist traps imagineable.  The film mines this line for most of its best jokes, including sets littered with Target, Revlon, and other logos, and a hilarious boy band named Du Jour (With song Back Door Lover) that regretably only appear before the main credits. The film falters when it gets into typical will-the-band-break-up antics followed by even more typical now-that-they-are-broken-up-how-long-will-the-movie-keep-them-apart stuff.  Unfortunately, formula wins out over the clever barbs in the end, to the point where I really didn't enjoy much of anything in the film's final half hour.  The Pussycats are a cute trio, though none of them really show any chops (Nor does the script give them any chance to) and their characters are as deep as the word you can describe them with (Melody is the dumb one).  Alan Cumming gets tons of time on screen as an evil music mogul but he feels wasted, same for Parker Posey as his boss.  Cameos by real-life music people also fall flat, including Carson Daly who is a lot less natural playing himself on film as he is playing himself on tv.   I'd call this film a disappointment; I like the creators, and they have some good ideas here, they follow through just isn't as smooth as the backswing.  There's a good movie in here, but it's hidden beneath formula, cliche, and bad acting.

It strikes me that certain people went along with the intention of having an utterly miserable time if they saw anything less brilliant than 'Citizen Kane', then took enormous pleasure in savaging this film when it failed to reach their vast expectations. Frankly if you are so utterly an elitist in films that the thought of teenage or 20ish characters (God forbid) or their brand of pop culture makes you break out into a hysterical fit of ranting, then you should have known better than to stay away from this.DuJour are an utterly devastating parody of a boyband, and understandably much of the first half-hour is spent in their shadow. Still our introduction to the Pussycats is well done, and easily establishes their current standing. Rachael Leigh Cook, a stunning actress with the largest eyes I have ever seen, is nicely done here. To anyone who would doubt her comedic talent - or lack of interest there in - just watch her eye movements in her first scene with Alan M. Maybe, and I confess I am not an expert, she is different from the cartoon Josie, but by all accounts that is a good thing. In the cartoons I hear she was a nonentity, here she is the core character of the film. While Tara Reid's Melody is perhaps funnier, Josie is still the centre and Rachael Leigh Cook does it well. The other Pussycats have similar good moments, though shorter than Josie's.Alan Cumming simply lights up the screen whenever he appears. While we are required to actually like Josie, Mel and Val (and they are in fact very likeable) Cummings Whyatt Frame is under no such constraints and it is entirely suitable that he is the only character to break the fourth wall. Posey Parker is almost as good as Cumming, but odder yet. She is good fun in the film, though not as purely fantastic as Cumming.The supporting cast are okay. Paulo Costanzo as the Pussycats hopeless manager Alexander Cabot III is the best, but Missi Pyle, Gabriel Mann, Tom Butler and especially Alexander Martin, are all very good.I'm amazed that so many people seem to have either not realised the product placement was part of the films joke, or have realised it, but decide to hold it against them anyway. The gag does become a little cloying after a while, but it does slow down a bit in the final half hour, and is never too distracting. If you found the product placement scene in Waynes World funny, this should cause you no trouble.The music is of course down to personal taste, but I found some of it at least pretty good, and nothing more unmemorable than any other film track. '3 Simple Words' and 'Pretend to be Nice' are viable singles in their own right, and you will never be able to listen to a boyband again after 'Backdoor Lover' and 'DuJour around the World'. Rachael Leigh Cook, Tara Reid and Rosario Dawson do at least provide backing for their own songs, which is something.Overall I would say that this was one of the most underrated films of 2001 and the least deserved flop. What kind of sick world is it where 'The Mummy Returns' is more popular than 'Josie...?' Watch it.Yours~Ross "},{"Title":"over the top fun....","Date":"17 September 2001","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Music","Review":"  'Josie and the Pussycats' is, from the very first shot until the last one, never serious about itself.

They both play characters that are so over the top that it is hard to take them seriously, and at the same time, I found it hard not to laugh at them.  It is also evident that the movie is not serious about itself from the excessive amount of product placement in the movie.  There is so much of it that its an obvious attempt to poke fun at such a thing.  I don't think that there is a product that isn't plugged in the movie.

In an era when TV to film adaptations are usually paint-by-number renditions, Josie stands out as fairly well-written and most definitely clever.  Interestingly enough, this movie could have survived (and probably even benefitted) if it had NOT  been associated with the cartoon show that it is very loosely based on.The characters (as well as the feel of the movie) are appropriately 'cartoonish' and this is due in large part from the fantastic direction by Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan, veterans of the vastly underrated Can't Hardly Wait (which they hilariously reference in this movie).  The movie moves at a fast pace, which is perfect for a satire of the breakneck-paced music industry.The standout acting in Josie is provided by Alan Cumming, whose portrayal of the slimy, faux-British record exec Wyatt Frame is excellently executed. Parker Posey's performance as Fiona, the head of the evil record company, is very good as well, as has come to be expected from the queen of indies. The trio of Josie, Val and Melody (Rachel Leigh Cook, Rosario Dawson, Tara Reid) is fair to good, with Cook being the standout because of her flair for comedy and her nervous portrayal of the heroine.The one problem with the script is Josie's 'transformation' to an evil character.  It happens too quickly, and it doesn't last nearly long enough to reward the viewers during her eventual turn back to hero.When looking at the clever writing and biting satire (as well as a cameo by Eugene Levy), Josie seems to be more akin to Christopher Guest's recent movies than the lightweight teen fare I had expected to see.  This is a very pleasant surprise, and truly worth watching.

The song they're singing is called Back-Door Lover, and in case the title is too subtle for you, the lyrics and dance routine should eventually clue-in all but the most imperceptive viewer that this is a light-hearted ditty about anal sex. Maybe a 12-year-old girl wouldn't catch it, but just based on that scene alone I wouldn't take a daughter of mine to see Josie & the Pussycats. But all-in-all it is a sufficiently-amusing roast of the sad state of music groups today (which don't even deserve to be called bands because that word denotes that they can play their own instruments) that a jaded thirty-year-old like myself could enjoy the rest of the movie, sans daughter, if it had more bits like that. I also couldn't help but notice that towards the end of the movie, a few expletives get tossed out as well. While it's certainly not enough swearing to hold a candle to the non-stop stream of profanities found in a PG-13-rated Kevin Smith movie, it's just enough that, again, it's not something fit for children.But most of Josie & the Pussycats is sugar-coated, smut-free kiddie fare, with nothing more risque than an open-mouthed kiss or two. The plot consists of a simple rags-to-riches Cinderella storyline and is populated by archetypical characters that haven't got much more depth than their Hanna-Barbera cartoon counterparts. One gets the distinct impression that this was a tale intended for girls who still have an active Barbie doll collection. For instance, Melody is a twentysomething-year-old whose internal monologue consists of singing If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands! to herself. Then there's all the childish humor and jokes that are way to obvious to be deemed clever by an adult, such as the running product-placement gag as well as several scenes where a character, in a fit of smarm, decides to stop the flow of the film by breaking the 4th wall.So what were directors Debbie and Harry trying to accomplish here? They made a movie that is haphazardly marketed towards girls somewhere in the pre-to-post bubblegum-popping teeny-bopper age demographic, and yet they actually expect those very same space cadets to appreciate the movie as itmocks them and their shallow tastes in music? The movie would've been better off trying to appeal to  cynical generation-X Metallica fans.Having said all that, there are two major aspects of the movie I have to praise the Pussycats' songs. The first is Rachel Leigh Cook. She has a breathtaking look as Josie. She should really consider keeping it.The second would be the music. 3 Small Words, Pretend to Be Nice, and Spin Around, are a lot of fun to listen to. These tunes fuse pop and rock together with a remarkable smoothness, having just enough of an edge to get me shaking my head and doing the white-man's-overbite, yet incorporating just enough pop flavor to make the experience qualify as a guilty pleasure. If music groups today were fueled by the innovativeness and sheer spunk of the Pussycats rather than the pre-processed, mass-produced, corporate-choreographed You-go-girl! formula of Eden's Crush and Destiny's Child, you might see a few of us cynical generation-Xers standing in line to pick up the latest top 10 hits along with the teeny-boppers, rather than fantasizing about beating the tar out of Justin Timberlake as we lay back listening to Dark Side of the Moon for the ten-thousandth time.

One gets the distinct impression that this was a tale intended for girls who still have an active Barbie doll collection. For instance, Melody is a twentysomething-year-old whose internal monologue consists of singing If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands! to herself. Then there's all the childish humor and jokes that are way to obvious to be deemed clever by an adult, such as the running product-placement gag as well as several scenes where a character, in a fit of smarm, decides to stop the flow of the film by breaking the 4th wall.So what were directors Debbie and Harry trying to accomplish here? They made a movie that is haphazardly marketed towards girls somewhere in the pre-to-post bubblegum-popping teeny-bopper age demographic, and yet they actually expect those very same space cadets to appreciate the movie as it mocks them and their shallow tastes in music? The movie would've been better off trying to appeal to the cynical generation-X Metallica fans that wind up beating the daylights out of DuJour.Having said all that, there is one major aspect of the movie I have to praise the Pussycats' songs. 3 Small Words, Pretend to Be Nice, and Spin Around, are a lot of fun to listen to. These tunes fuse pop and rock together with a remarkable smoothness, having just enough of an edge to get me shaking my head and doing the white-man's-overbite, yet incorporating just enough pop flavor to make the experience qualify as a guilty pleasure. If music groups today were fueled by the innovativeness and sheer spunk of the Pussycats rather than the pre-processed, mass-produced, corporate-choreographed You-go-girl! formula of Eden's Crush and Destiny's Child, you might see a few of us cynical generation-Xers standing in line to pick up the latest top 10 hits along with the teeny-boppers, rather than fantasizing about kicking the crap out of Justin Timberlake as we lay back listening to Dark Side of the Moon for the ten-thousandth time.

Why? Well, the original Melody always came up with stupid comments, ideas, or thoughts; so did Tara Reid, giving Melody the right pitch of voice for every intervention she made.Josie...no one knows why she was really the leader of the group, probably because she was the vocalist of the band.  You noticed that Josie was present due to the fact that Alexandra was jealous of her.  And that's how Rachael Leigh Cook personified her.  She's really that outstanding.Valerie  she was the brainy of the gang.  Always planning how to catch the bad guys.  But this time, Rosario Dawson couldn't impose her character, which really was an important piece of the machinery.  It's a pity, because the original Valerie was charming.Alan.  He was the stud, the leading man.  Gabriel Mann also couldn't give him enough weight on the movie (or maybe because the writers didn't wanted to).  His physical appearance didn't helped him very much either to fill in the space of the original Alan.Alexander was always the coward, whining guy; not the Mr. Wise Guy.  Paulo Costanzo portrayed him as a lazy, good-for-nothing manager.  The original Alexander, had, at least, more personality.Alexandra and The Pussycats.  That's how the show should have been called originally.  She gave life to the TV cartoon show.  It was so funny to see her fighting for Alan over Josie.  But, on the other hand, on the movie, she was a zero to the left.  Maybe the writers should have put more emphasis in such an important character.The movie was funny, though.  I liked more the part where the guys of Dujour appeared, making a bunch of fools of the Backstreet Boys, N Sync, and all those teeny bopper bands.

Needing a new band, the label signs up Josie and the Pussycats and hopes to continue to exploit 'the kids'.I have never read any Archie Comics stuff or seen the old TV show, and probably missed some of the comic / TV related jokes, but I can't say it affected my enjoyment of the film.I've read some of the other reviews on IMDB and wasn't entirely happy with them. You see, sometimes a film is so bad it's fantastic, but I would rate this film as being similar to Mystery Men. It has moments of sheer genius, but there are not enough of them to make this a truly great film. So, sadly, it falls slightly short of being so bad it's good.However, the opening scene is one of the funniest things I have ever seen. There are hordes of young girls (and a few boys) screaming hysterically at the appearance of Dujour. The song they sing is called `Back Door Lover'. If you have seen this film, and even if you haven't, go and buy the soundtrack and listen to the words of this song. Then watch the film. It sounds like Boyzone / Back Street Boys / Nsync, but has lyrics they would never sing!The rest of the film has it's moments and is not bad, although the ending is a bit crap.

The boy band DuJour (how that phrase goes together!) is quite funny in their brief appearance, and the lyrics to Backdoor Lover really have to be listened to to appreciate.The performances range from wonderful (Alan Cummings) to awful (Carson Daly), but the Pussycats are just fine, and as far as their attractiveness goes... well, I fear for the social life of a young man for whom not one of these beautiful young women meets his standards.The best Josie song is Three Small Words, and while none of the others reaches that height of exuberance and immediacy, the others are still pretty good and catchy.I'm not a moron, I'm not a studio hack, and I enjoyed it.

I found it to be pointless, but then I realized how often I read these reviews, and that if I had read reviews for this movie before I saw it (as I sometimes do) that I probably would have stayed far away from the theatre. Fortunately for me, I avoided the reviews until after seeing the film this time.  I have racked my brain trying to figure out why this movie has gotten such terrible reviews. Going into the theatre I had no expectations whatsoever. I knew nothing about the cartoon or the comic. I am not a fan of your typical teen movie either. I hated She's All That, and movies of the like. This may be a film that is targeted towards teens, but in my opinion delivers to a much wider audience. I am in my mid-twenties and laughed hysterically through the entire length of this film.  Expecting a serious movie, or even one with a serious plot you will not like this movie. But you can tell just from the previews that that is not what this film is supposed to be. I wanted to be entertained, and many serious films have not even lived up to that potential recently. This was entertainment at it's best. A good comedy, much like a good horror movie, is extremely rare, and I was very excited to finally find one. The casting was perfect, the soundtrack was probably one of the best since Reality Bites and The Crow, and the plot was absolutely hilarious. Don't listen to the reviews on this one, the theatre that I was echoed with laughter. And from my personal experience the general public is a much better source than anyone who calls him or herself a film critic. After all, aren't we all?Obviously if you are reading this then you value my opinion. And as I said this is the first review I have written, so obviously I had something important to say.  Bottom line...10/10...I walked out of the theatre wanting to walk right back in for a second run. Being that I saw the late show I settled for heading across the street to Wal-Mart for the soundtrack. Go see Josie! It rocks!

Commercialization, or PIMPING is not a spectator sport.An unfortunate message to send when young men are eager to attend a film in which PUSSY appears prominently in the title and the main characters are young, nubile, twenty-somethings.  Actresses whom this viewer was hoping could prove their namesakes.As the Riverdale Trio; Rachel Leigh Cook, Tara Ried, and Rosario Dawson seemed lost and confused.  Was this a comedy?  A social satire?  Perhaps a BRAZIL for the clearasil set.  Regardless of what the filmmakers had intended, it doesn¹t seem the shared such information with the cast.Emoting with a certain apathy that prevents the audience from becoming concerned (or interested) at all, only the bubbly Tara Ried managed to create a character who could have come from Riverdale.

I never take time to write comments on here (although I wish I did) but I was afraid people might miss this film and I felt it my duty to inform the world. The directors take every opportunity here to attack conformity and commercialism at every turn. The irony here is that there is more product placement in this film than probably in other in the history of time. This is a brilliant way to get funding for a film that attacks the very idea. I wonder if these companies or the studios ever read the script. Unfortunately they probably did and knew that it really wouldn't effect their sales in a negative way. I say this because of who the film was really targeting and hoping to probably challenge, and that is American teenagers. There were plenty in the screening that I saw and unfortunately I believed that they missed the point. That in fact corporations and old white businessmen determine what will be cool and acceptable. That every trend, from the mall kids that all dress alike to those who believe that the current crop of alternative rock is rebellious, is being packaged and sold to them. It also shows us what happens to the young artists who believe in themselves and how corporate money can alter the way they see their art form and their very perceptions of reality. Film could always be used for something more than mere entertainment, and here they achieve something on multiple levels. It's unfortunate that the people who really need to absorb this film will either dismiss it as fun or dislike it because it challenges their very existence.This movie also worked for me on a comedy level. It is a complete exercise in the absurd. This works wonderfully with the fast cutting style and high-energy music. It's great to look at and great to think about.

There was only one rave on the print ad on for this film, which usually sets off warning signs.  Plus, given the track record for adaptations of old TV shows, I wasn't expecting much.  But after it was over, I was pleasantly surprised.  This is a very clever satire, in the same vein as American Psycho and Fight Club, but much more family-friendly. I'd never read the comic or watched the show (both were before my time), but that really didn't matter.  It just took the basics (the basics that I'm aware of) and planted it in the 90's, making them a struggling rock group in a small town.  The plot, which combines satire of the commercialism in the music industry (hardly a scene goes by without some blatant product placement) and a nefarious scheme involving mind control as it relates to pop culture, paints with a very wide brush and rarely misses.  The three girls do well, but it's Tara Reid as Melodie that really steals the show, particularly in a scene with Carson Daly as himself.  And, as every good film needs a good villain, the film gives us not one, but two, in the form of Alan Cumming and Parker Posey as a pair of ruthless record executives.

The stars, Rachel Leigh Cook, Tara Reid, and Rosario Dawson are serious eye candy, and there were some funny bits.  The music, however, was a revelation!  Oh how I wish there was a rocking power trio of hot chicks like the Pussycats on the radio nowadays.  Of course, the actors had nothing to do with the music, but surely the music business could cobble together some babes with some drum and bass chops to back up the lead singer, who I believe was with Letters to Cleo, and make a few records.As for the film, the most important thing in bringing a comic book or animated series to the big screen is to be as faithful to the original as possible, regardless of how silly it is, and here the filmakers succeed admirably.  The extraneous character of Alexandra (Missi Pyle from Galaxy Quest) even says she's only there because I'm in the comic.  Josie, Val, and Melody are their same old selves, with Reid especially evoking Melody's sweet goofyness.  Parker Posey and Alan Cumming lend their considerable talent as the clueless villains.  Seth Green does a great turn as a boy band member with issues.The plot consists of the obtuse observation that the music industry is trying to co-opt the minds of teenagers into buying stuff they don't need, and Josie and the 'Cats bid to stop them, by, I guess, becoming a part of it.  The irony flows freely, as the movie itself takes part in the crass commercialization it supposedly abhors.  With many winks and nods to the camera, the action builds to a thoroughly silly and implausible conclusion, again, much like the original TV series.  I would definitely watch it again on video, if only for the skin-tight outfits of the comely 'Cats and the hard rocking soundtrack, but I would not recommend paying $8 to see it.

But you don't have to call the people who DID think it was funny mindless trash or something of the sort. Because people are different.

There's also a hint of a smart music-biz satire that might have been, had co-writer/co-directors Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan reached a bit deeper and aimed higher.  Alas, the movie remains about as substantial as the cartoon series it was based on.  Easy to watch, but just as easy to forget.The main problem here is the story, which hangs on a concept that's pretty dated in this day and age; that there are subliminal messages in the kiddie-pop music and that this brainwashes the kids into consumer and pop-culture frenzy.  If only things were that simple and uncomplicated.  The concept might have seemed fresh and novel about 10 years ago, but it's neither clever nor particularly funny today.  The producers seem to have also gone WAY beyond the call of duty as far as the element of product placement in entertainment goes.  This movie is FILLED to bursting with blatant product-placement and once the point is made, it quickly becomes obnoxious and distracting.I actually had relatively high hopes entering the theatre.  Elfont and Kaplan's last effort was 1998's Can't Hardly Wait, another teen-oriented comedy that, while not exactly profound itself, was a goofy, funny and occasionally insightful little film reminiscent of John Hughes' teen comedies of the 1980s. They also co-authored the smartly satirical A Very Brady Sequel.  Maybe I'm getting older...this movie was not aimed at me....but I was disappointed with Josie And The Pussycats because I know the filmmakers had proved before that they are capable of so much more.Rachel Leigh Cook, Tara Reid and Rosario Dawson are attractive and talented as the title group, but they're saddled with pretty dull material here, left to do not much more than look pretty and strike poses.  Indie-film darling Parker Posey is largely wasted in a vampy role of a record company exec.  Only Alan Cumming, as an sneaky, sleazy tour promoter, manages to mold a memorable and consistently amusing character.  Cumming, who can also be seen in a semi-villainous role in the current film Spy Kids, is making his name as one of the great character actors of our time.Kids may enjoy it, but with few memorable scenes and the absence of any clever, quotable dialogue, it's hard to imagine even them wanting to see it more than once.

Though this is not exactly THE BUDDY HOLLY STORY or EDDIE AND THE CRUSIERS this is indeed a movie not a long-form music video.  It is also based on the Archie comic strip (and 70's animated Saturday morning TV show) and it belongs to that long time successful genre of film.  The good thing is that you don't really need any past knowledge of the cartoon characters and their original situations. One mistake in bringing cartoon characters to life is revisiting the era which made them famous (as with the very dated cold war spoof ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE, the prohibition-era DICK TRACY, and the President Hoover era POPEYE).  Cartoon characters are ageless and bringing them to life is like playing musical chairs.  Once you say Hey you're real! you can stop in our own era.  Even the stone-aged FLINTSTONES (actually a spoof of 1960's suburbia) were updated to spoof the nineties with such current pop items as McDonalds.  Comic strips and comic books constantly update the period while keeping their characters young.  Live action versions of SUPERMAN and BATMAN constantly keep up with the times as do THE ADDAMS FAMILY (yes it was a newspaper comic), CASPER, and that other Archie comic strip SABRINA THE TEENAGE WITCH.  JOSIE is very much rooted into our time and all the current girl bands and boy bands.  The music is very much what you would expect of a pop band of today, as are the costumes (sure they look silly, but not as silly as real life rock star Bjork's swan dress at the Oscars).  This is a movie the entire family will love.

Some teens might hate it since it makes them all look so stupid, especially during the gut-bustingly funny scenes parodying Nsync and their dancing.  The script is too often by-the-books, and anyone should be able to predict most developments without effort, but the preview audience was in stitches several times, and a character makes a reference to their *original* origins that drew a near ovation of applause from a crowd ranging from li'l kids to greyhairs.

I saw a premiere in Boston for free so i figured i can't go wrong. (expect of course if it was the blair witch project 2, Yuck) Well it turns out i was right, the movie was cheesy fun and i emphasized on the word cheesy.The point of the movie is simple, we live in a age of complete advertisement, you are a target market. Every thing around us is all advertisement, sporting events, concerts, movies, heck just look on the top and bottom of this site and i will guarantee that there is a add for something. this movie surrounds this topic in a slap stick sort of way.The writers exaggerated that everything is controlled by media and entertainment, in this case putting hidden messages in music to brain wash teens into thinking what is cool and what isn't. Example pink is the new red That's where Josie and the pussycats come into play. There Music is Brain Washing teens without them even realizing it.I don't want to ruin anymore of this movie, but i do recommend sometime to check it out. It's not the greatest movie in the world but is entertaining and i feel most people will find this movie was enjoyable unless, of course you take it too seriously.Jon's movie rating 7.5/10  "},{"Title":"Pretty Kitty gets stuck up a tree...","Date":"4 April 2001","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Music","Review":"  Just saw a sneak preview of this. Gotta say that I was a huge fan of the cartoon show, and that although I have reservations about the film, I don't think it's entirely bad.First up, the idea behind the film,the government and the Pussycats' record company planting subliminal messages in music to sell stuff to teenagers is a really interesting and clever and topical one, and much of the humor surrounding this is very funny (with some dead-on jokes about boy bands). The catch-22 is that this means the film is telling its target audience You're morons, not least because it dumbs down so much of the story to try and make it work on the lowest possible level - the last ten minutes of the movie absolutely die because of the dumbing down.Rachael Leigh Cook is good as Josie, and Rosario Dawson, Tara Reid and Parker Posey all seem to be having fun (although Missi Pyle's Alexandra Cabot just seems totally grotesque), but part of the film's problem is that it doesn't really build relationships between the characters. They're just sort of there and some of them just seem to be there because they were in the cartoon (something one of them actually says at one point). Sad thing is that in the cartoon, the characters' relationships were much better drawn.But that's dwelling on the bad stuff. There's good stuff too, in both the performances and the satire, and what makes the film most interesting is that the concept behind it makes it not just another teen movie. It could even be argued that the dumbing down of the script is a postmodern joke about teen movies. If it is, it doesn't work, but then much of the satire in the film (references to Leif Garrett, etc) did go soaring over the heads of the 16-year-olds in the audience, so while twentysomethings may appreciate it for that, I doubt many of the kids will. They should either have done it as a smarter satire, and gone for the 18-to-25 audience, or done it as a straighter story and aimed it at the teenagers.Oh yeah, and Josie purists may be annoyed that Sebastian the cat is missing, and Josie's hometown is given as Riverdale.So anyway, as it is, Josie and the Pussycats doesn't exactly cough up a hairball, but it feels like it's been declawed.

How do you take a short comic and turn it into an eight dollar plus night with strangers in a dark room with sticky floors?  The recipe  Toss in Rachel Leigh Cook's best performance, mix in solid support from Tara Reid and Rosario Dawson, leaven with a oh so heavy, oh so light Alan Cumming, add a so over the top Parker Posey, and shake and bake with an absurd but just maybe true conspiracy about big business and the government experimenting on mind control. . . and let simmer for a few days after you walk back out into the sunshine.Of course you know they were kidding.But product placement will never be quite so effective again.

I thought this is a perfect example of how to make a cartoon into a live-action movie. The characters in the movie are cartoon-like in how they act, but not how they look, which is as it's supposed to be. The reverse approach other movies have are actors in spandex trying to be realistic. No spandex in this film.All three girls look perfect throughout. They all look sexy (while keeping their clothes on). If you want an *escape* rent this movie.

For one thing it wasn't a live action version of the comic book or the animated series from the 70s.  It just took the names and characters and changed everything.  So fans of the original comic were annoyed and newcomers didn't know what to make of this.  Still, it's not that bad.The Pussycats are a small band from Riverdale who want to make it big.  An evil record exec (Alan Cumming REALLY camping it up) propels them to superstardom overnight (literally) and uses their music to send subliminal marketing messages to teenagers.  Nothing new plot wise but it's still somewhat funny.  There's constant product placement in every frame of the movie--it's there as a joke but it still IS product placement.  The script is OK--no great shakes but there are some really good lines.  There's some good acting too by Cumming, Rosasrio Dawson (as Val in the band) and Tara Reid (as Melody).  Unfortunately, everybody else is pretty bad especially Rachel Leigh Cook (as Josie) and (surprisingly) Parker Posey as another evil executive.  That really weighs the movie down.

I didn't realize that both Parker Posey & Alan Cumming were in the movie, nor did I realize that an upcoming Missy Pyle was so fricken funny! The biggest thing that probably killed this movie was the MTV tie-ins, this movie was so pimped on MTV, and I couldn't help but think all I was going to see is some 90 minutes of MTV marketing hype.I was semi-right, but in a really cool way! Instead it's a movie that's actually anti-marketing, in both music and movies. The basic plot line is how a music producer lays in subliminal tracks on little pop groups for their easily manipulated fans to go out and buy everything they're told too. Then we get the never tiring jokes of all the product placements through out the whole movie, everything from Dawn soap in an airplane to McDonalds in a shower scene. You'd think with so much product placement the studio made all its money back just with that. Actually, it turns out that they felt that taking money for the products was hypocritical to the plot and took nothing at all.I really do recommend the movie, the cast is brilliant their rolls, did I mention yet that Seth Green plays a member of a boy band?

Rachel Leigh Cook is both beautiful by Hollywood standards AND beautiful per se (there can't be many women who are both at once), while Rosario Dawson is sweetly, curvily gorgeous.  Tara Reid it's hard to tell about she's not so much a character as a sustained blonde joke.  But hey, blonde jokes are still funny.  Two easy approaches to comedy are `How stupid can we make this character behave while still making him (her) appear to have mental processes?', and `How gross can we get?'  But the former approach requires a little more creativity and is far more amusing.  Homer Simpson is a finer comic creation than Fat B***ard.Also, I liked the music.  Go ahead, snicker.  It's catchy, with surprisingly well-crafted lyrics.  You could do much worse.The think for yourself preaching was a bit too obvious and laboured, but it WAS heartfelt, while the comment on the way corporations package art was in fact rather sneaky.

I love how well they played on the corporate tie-ins (from which they received little money if any). I remember seeing trailers for this movie and thinking, oh god some crappy sell out teen movie. Then when my sister was watching it one time I heard Backdoor Lover and couldn't stop laughing at how great it was that they got that song in what could be called a kids movie. There were so many little things that made the movie brilliant. I'm not saying that any of the three lead actresses are the best of actors, they aren't by far... maybe rosario dawson, but the other two.... eh. What makes this movie a 10 is Parker Posey and Alan Cumming. They are brilliant. Not one un-funny line in the whole damn thing. The Carson daily cameo is pretty funny, primarily because of the little jokes made between him and tara reid (movie was made while they were engaged), and then watching it knowing that whole thing is over. Seth green, donald faison, brecken meyer and that other guy are nothing short of brilliant! The scenes they are in and even the one in the end that the three names aren't in, are hilarious. This is the perfect attack on pop culture. It hits every mark dead on and digs its teeth in. I can understand how someone wouldn't like it. Bad acting, mediocre script ( to most people) dumb idea.
