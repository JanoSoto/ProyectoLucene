The appeal of the film lies largely in the fabulous cast that was put together. Mr. Sullivan delivers a 'feel good' movie that will warm hearts for viewers of all ages.When Jack's wife dies, suddenly, he is left alone with an infant girl. Jack has no clue about what to do with the baby. His life goes into a tailspin. Enter his kind parents and former mother-in-law. They all have ideas about what to do with Sarah, but Jack ends up resenting their interference. That's when he has the bright idea of getting a nanny for little Sarah.Amy, the girl he hires, is probably the wrong kind for the job. Little does Jack know, Amy doesn't have a clue about children, let alone, how to handle them. The only thing that is clear is that Amy loves her little charge. Amy and Sarah seem to have been made for one another. Jack warms up to the babysitter and they find one another in love because of Sarah.Richard E. Grant is a versatile actor. He is tremendously appealing as the confused father of a baby he was not prepared to handle. Samantha Mathis makes an endearing Amy, the girl that steals Jack's heart. Judi Dench, Eileen Atkins, Ian McKellen are seen in in supporting roles that add great charm to the film.This is a fun film thanks to Tim Sullivan.

It's just a comedy, but it's more than that too It's a very heart-warming comedy, and to my way of thinking is all that the British 'Jurassic Park' (Four Weddings and a Funeral) was supposed to be - very British, but a lot better view.

Jack and Sarah is the story of a man (Grant) whose wife/girlfriend (they never seem to tell you which) dies giving birth to their daughter. In his grief, he must decide whether to give up on life and in to his drinking addiction, or else to make a comeback and take care of his now motherless child. I think we're all very happy with the result. What I was really charmed by was the realistic and tender way Grant presented his character. Here is a man, not superhuman, not faultless, and a man who has lost the person he loved most in his life. He also is so adorable with the baby Sarah (I loved their little bath scene!).Plus, if it is absolutely to bring an American into it (the only spoiler I can find here) then Samantha Mathis is certainly a beautiful and charming choice. And let me not discount Judi Dench, Ian McKellen, Eileen Atkins, and David Swift as the older friends and family who set out to guide Jack on his journey of fatherhood and, eventually, second love. McKellen is particularly good as the good natured bum from the skip(dumpster). A real gem! I give it a 10!

Richard E Grant, playing Jack is the first twist, a crazy workaholic type who likes to control everything and is completely narcissistic, witness him going through labour pains at the prenatal course.Jack is extremely unlikable, so much so that his pregnant wife, in an aside, whispers to her unborn baby that single parenthood might be ahead. Shift to the childbirth and the unfortunate death of the mother. Jack dissolves into morose alcoholism and narcissistic isolation.How Jack slowly evolves into something resembling a caring human being is the crux of the story. The supporting cast is amazing - Ian Maclellan, Judi Dench, Eileen Atkins - and they add points to a movie I would have rated below a 5 without them. Samantha Mathis tries but doesn't quite engage. We never know enough about her to care, apart from her infatuation with a guy who's bonking her best friend.I understand that Stephen Rea turned down the part of Jack and I would have preferred his tired jadedness in the role. Jack has a horror-movie type mania that jolts too much at times, I would seriously be reluctant to let him alone with a baby anything. Material has been done many times, but a nice twist at the end too. The main romance was so predictable, but so are they all in movies of this type. We go to them for no surprises, just the warm, slightly cloying fuzzies at the end. 6 out of 10.

Indeed the film succeeds effortlessly when the actors have a reasonable chunk of script or scene to work with (with the exception of the mediocre Samantha Mathis). I also really enjoyed the fluid comedy, moving between the obvious and the surprising, equally well delivered by the ensemble.The film falls down though in its rather piecemeal approach. There's a feeling, almost literally, of the film being put together as if by marketeering scientists, looking to maximise its impact. There any number of bizarrely framed shots and loose ends - the set piece is king at the expense of overall cohesion. 4/10 but, hang on, I was conspicuously aware of it not being written or directed by Richard Curtis, so 5/10 for avoiding clone status.

It has its moments, but the story is ridiculous, as are the actions of the characters, the humor is mild and the drama is maudlin. While the main problem is the drab script and pedestrian direction, the movie is also harmed by Mathis' performance. This is not to say that she is particularly bad, but she is not warm and loving and charming to make the film's absurd premise work. She seemed kind of ordinary, and that is exactly what the role does not call for. I like Grant, and he's decent in this, although I think he only really shines in more prickly roles.

I am a huge fan of Ian McKellen and Judi Dench, and when I saw they were going to be in the same film together, I thought to myself this movie is going to be good! Overall, I was not disappointed. Some parts are slow, but the acting more than made up for it. Tim Sullivan's direction ensured that the film didn't get too sentimental, though some of it is very sweet and poignant, and the script is honest and touching. Jack & Sarah is very nice to look at too, the cinematography and scenery are both lovely, and the music is very warm and inviting. But the real delight is the acting; Richard E.Grant is very good as the high-flying lawyer/bumbling father figure, while Samantha Mathis is appealing as the nanny who falls for her employer. However, Ian McKellen as the tramp-cum-butler in a class of his own and Judi Dench as Margaret are the ones who steal the show, while Eileen Atkins gives terrific support.

"},{"Title":"More substantial than your average 'romantic comedy'","Date":"25 June 2007","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" One of the strengths of this film is its subtlety. The first ten or fifteen minutes are a great example. Few words are needed yet volumes of emotion are communicated through those scenes. Another - later - example is where Jack and his father are in the park when it's snowing. The weather seems to exaggerate the raw, emotional pain Jack is going through but no words are needed because the viewer knows exactly what he is feeling.The scene where the grief hits Jack is very poignant - he has been almost in a trance until then, trying to carry on as normal and yet what finally gets him in touch with his grief for Sarah is the almost ordinary combination of her lipstick on the wine glass and her voice on the answerphone. He tried to be so prepared, so involved in his wife's pregnancy but never came close to being prepared for the real outcome.I hate to say it, but there are points during Jack's early mourning period where the character comes across as what I believe non-English people think of the stereotypical Englishman - blocking out any emotion. Perhaps this is a disadvantage of the story starting when it does - we don't get any idea of what he was like before his wife Sarah was pregnant. The baby next to the sleeping Jack is an interesting metaphor. At that point, both are helpless in their own way, both only in tune with their own feelings, but baby Sarah at least has the excuse of not knowing any better. Jack's selfishness is entirely self-induced.There are some interesting attempts to explode stereotypes, which I think should be applauded. The characterisation of Jack's boss Anna is interesting - the assumption that just because she is female, she will be more sympathetic would be natural but she comes across as so work-driven that she almost becomes heartless. I think Jack is a bit overwhelmed by Anna, perhaps too much so - there are moments when she is quite cutting and when Jack would be right to correct her. There is a curious comparison with Amy, who - although superficially like other females in that she cooes over Sarah - is sufficiently vague at first that she doesn't even notice which sex baby Sarah is. Jack also tackles another himself over the issue of whether he can use the nursing mothers' room to change Sarah's nappy.In keeping with the theme of stereotypes, it is interesting how the opinions of the other characters try to influence the main ones. Jack's mum thinks Anna is outwardly great for him when she is really a selfish character, while Amy - who is a far kinder person - is written off as a dreadful American girl. The baby alarm worked rather well as a plot device - it's an overlooked but very useful piece of equipment. There are quite a lot of twists and turns in this plot - I think most are an intricate combination of clever writing and artful camera angles - but a lot of the plot development hinges on the budding relationship between Jack and Amy and when and how he treats her as a nanny or as a friend. It is obviously a grey area for them.On the surface, this film looks to be just your typical British romantic comedy but this one has some features that make it satisfyingly substantial. In terms of basic romantic plot it is broadly like Four Weddings and a Funeral, but unlike that film it is deeper and the characters are better written and investigated.

I like romantic comedies. And anything with Judi Dench and Ian McKellen must have something to offer. But I came away from this movie with my face all curled up, not in a good way.Jack and Sarah is a movie about a carefree young lawyer named Jack who has a lovely, level-headed wife named Sarah. She's pregnant with their first child; they're moving into their first house, and everything seems like things can't get better. But when Sarah announces she's in labor, Jack panics and injures himself and wakes up in the hospital to discover that Sarah has had the baby (also, later, named Sarah) -- and died (from some undisclosed complication; we're never told.) He leaves his daughter and goes on a bender. He is joined by his homeless friend William (McKellen, in a wasted--pardon the pun--role). He's well on his way to being a lifetime drunk when his well-meaning parents and mother-in- law sneak in and put his baby into the bed with him and then refuse to help him. Suddenly Jack is a model of sobriety and loving fatherhood. He has to go back to work, so he takes the baby along, but that doesn't work...he interviews nannies but no one's good enough for his daughter.Enter Amy, an American waitress working in a café where Jack chances to dine. Coincidence brings them together and he offers her the job of nanny--although she doesn't even know how to change a diaper, she's more qualified than the professional nannies. Ever watch a romantic comedy and find that you can't root for the couple to get together? I end up doing it now and then; I don't want to, but when you're shown two people who have nothing in common except adoring the baby, it's just difficult to see the attraction. But that's the whole problem with the movie there's very little character development. Amy gets none. We have no idea why she's even in England. She's not much good at her job, whether it's waitressing or doing laundry. We don't know what kind of music, books, or movies she likes, or anything about her except that her boyfriend left her for someone else, and that she has a friend she occasionally hangs out with. She loves little Sarah, but heck, the baby or babies portraying her are so adorable that you'd have to be a lizard-like space alien not to, so it's not a real accomplishment.There's a lot of Jack going through his grief and mending his relationship with his father, but that's about it. I don't know, beyond little Sarah, what it is that draws Jack and Amy together, nor do I much care. The film is very disjointed, leaving me to think it was planned as a longer story and a lot of the (best?) scenes probably ended up being cut for time. Ian McKellen serves no purpose in the movie that I can see--and that's a shame, because he could have and should have been interesting. We see him as a lovable drunk, then at some point Jack apparently adopts/hires him as sort of a butler, and he of course tells Jack he's a dummy during the boy loses girl segment, but even that serves no purpose because everyone else tells him that too. (And I keep wondering why, because Amy's not an interesting person...) His major role seems to be in the surprise ending, and while that's certainly an eye-opener SPOILER ALERT---------he marries Phil (the mother of Jack's wife Sarah), even that's one that doesn't really make sense. It may make you laugh or cry, but if you think about it for longer than 30 seconds, you'll stop laughing and start going but why?The person given the best treatment, I thought, was (Jack's wife) Sarah's mother Phil, played by Eileen Atkins. She's good in every scene she's in, a loyal friend, a loving mother figure, and understanding when it's most needed. Of course that also serves to make you ask why, then, did she push Amy and Jack together, and why did she marry the sweet drunk?There's even a character I was sure was supposed to be important ...her name was Pamela, and I'm not sure whether she was Jack's or Sarah's much-younger sister. Early on, it seemed as if she'd have something to do, but she abruptly disappeared after a few minutes and didn't show up again until the ending.I know the movie title is Jack and Sarah, not Jack and Amy. And I get that in addition to a romantic comedy it's also supposed to be about Jack learning to be a parent. But even that's messed up, as Amy points out when she leaves him, since he's still irresponsible. Sure, he loves Sarah when he's around her, but he's not often around her--he's sloughing her off on nannies and grandparents so he can continue to work and go to bars and go on dates. I suppose the movie title could even be inferred to be about Jack's relationship with his wife Sarah, since he really loved her. But then he seems to get over her death remarkably fast, too, going out on dates with Anna his office boss and by his own admission trying to get laid. So physical need transcends grief. Okay, whatever...?Maybe this is secretly one of those existentialist movies that people occasionally toss out there to make us question our existence, and what people see in each other that draws them to another person. Of course it offers nothing in the way of answers, but it's certainly confusing enough to make you ask a lot of questions.

Some bits in it are totally sweet or funny or romantic, and others are just plain dull. I cannot warm to Richard E Grant at all. He remains stony faced throughout the whole film, whether he's supposed to be acting happy or sad. However Ian McKellen's performance as the tramp (who is just allowed in the house??) is fantastic, once you've got over the fact that Gandalf's beard is missing!!

"},{"Title":"An Interesting Romantic Comedy With Well-Rounded Performances","Date":"11 July 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Originally written by UK sitcom writer Tim O'Sullivan, Jack and Sarah is one of the very best British films that graced British cinema. The story begins with couple Jack and Sarah getting all loved up, Sarah then goes into labour and her husband, who panics, has to drive her to the hospital. Eventually, she gives birth to a healthy and beautiful baby daughter, much to the delight of Jack. Unfortunately, joy turns to anguish when Sarah dies during the childbirth, devastating Jack in the process. As a single parent, he faces a somewhat un daunting task of looking after his daughter, of whom he names Sarah whilst at the same time juggling his work responsibilities. Luckily for him, he meets an American woman named Amy, who earns her living as a waitress and thus, he hires her as his babysitter, much to the disapproval of Jack's mother played by Dame Judy Dench and so-called bum-turned butler played by Sir Ian McKellan. Thus, it isn't long before a romantic sub-plot involving Amy and Jack develops later on. Although the scheming Anna- Jack's boss, does go to great lengths to snake-charm her way into Jack's affections. Whilst Amy is sweet, down-to-earth and considerate, Anna comes across as rather self-centred, selfish and somewhat a nasty piece of work.The story very much centres on the relationship between Jack and Amy and the realisation that they are in love with one another, hence the transition from workers to eventual lovers. Samantha Mathis successfully manages to convey a quality in Amy that makes us want to like her and after her appearance in that awful Super Mario Brothers movie, she has redeemed herself in this movie.Jack and Sarah is a film with a very simple plot that is easy to understand, and yet its the performances by the two actors Grant and Mathis that make it a very good film overall. It's sentimental-yet still pleasing to eye, and though whilst this film deals with the issue of fatherhood and being a single parent, the romantic sub-plot involving Jack and Amy still plays an important part in the film, by means of which it implies that whilst being a single father, one doesn't have to give up hope in finding love and in falling in love with that person. Which is what happened with Jack and Amy.In all, it is well-written, well directed with a good cast and though whilst I am not a huge fan of Brit flicks, Jack and Sarah is extremely good. Highly recommended.

However, there was nothing interesting on the TV so I decided I could do worse than sit through a mediocre film. I missed the opening title so I was surprised to be confronted with Ian McKellen as a tramp... pleasantly! The film was predictable but well acted, in the main, with a few very funny moments and a few sad ones. It's worth a look just for McKellen who is superb.

Grant is just too hard to watch, not hideously bad, just hard to watch. His kitschy and formulaic approach to the character is somewhat embarrassing (and his haircut is beyond awful--where was the make-up dept anyway!!?? 1995 or not, it was hideous). Samantha Mathis definitely shouldn't be sharing any scenes with the likes of Judi Dench, Eileen Atkins, or Ian McKellan. Mathis is incredibly hard to watch as it is, then when she shares scenes with all of the above it just makes her look BEYOND FOOLISH. It was almost like watching a scene study exercise in acting class, where you feel incredibly sorry for the girl in the scene because she just isn't believable and is truly hard to watch. Mathis is beyond lucky to be acting opposite Dench, Atkins and McKellan. Almost as though someone pulled some favor to get her into this film. There are so many thousands of other talented American actresses who would have made this character so much more brilliant! What a total disaster, and tragedy of wasted celluloid. The only reason to watch this movie is for the supporting cast. For that matter, it seems that the supporting cast members were the only reason this movie could have been produced in the first place. With a terribly weak script, BAD BAD BAD lead actors, and trite resolution to the story who would sink money into this without the assurance of some real acting talent. It's truly amazing what a McKellan, Dench, and Atkins can make possible. Leave the real acting to the real actors next time! Please!

Jack and Sarah tries to encompass too many genres, swinging as it does from near satire to near pathos without warning, leaving the viewer more surprised than moved. Our writer/director Tim Sullivan appears to prepare us for an unorthodox comedy about starting a family, then hits us with a bombshell that causes the plot to make a complete about face. During the course of the film more about faces are incorporated (not blended) which serves only to tantalise, but not fulfil, the audience's emotions. Still, in this light it is something different - British of course - from the usual romantic-comedies being churned out these days.Richard E. Grant slides comfortably into the role of the dad who doesn't seem to know when he's on a good thing. A most enjoyable turn from an agreeable actor. In support of him is the evergreen Judi Dench, as his sour old mum, and Imogen Stubbs, as his tragic wife. Samantha Mathis is the other completely disarming lead, playing the young American lass who takes an immediate shining to baby Sarah, and promptly signs up as Jack's nanny.Certainly Jack and Sarah could have been an unforgettable, emotionally powerful drama. However the light, almost aloof manner that has been adopted here leaves a distinct British feel to this pic, but gives it no chance of becoming dramatically moving. Thankfully a change, yet falls short of its potential.Saturday, February 3, 1996 - Astor Theatre "},{"Title":"a nice little film","Date":"17 May 2006","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" I saw this film today, mainly to see Judi Dench,Ian McKellan and Elieen Atkins ( all 3 acting greats) in the same film. Ian and Elieen were in a off Broadway play (along with Ian McShane) in 1969. It ran 3 months. So its safe to say, Ian and Eileen are good friends from way back. I liked this film very much. I did wish Judi,Ian and Elieen had bigger parts. All three are cast well in their roles. Ian is a hoot. he is usually cast in more serious roles. A light fluffy bit of fun.The entire cast is good. The actor in the lead is quite good.The girl is good as well. Not a bad film at all.A nice way to spend 2 hours. Go check it out.

People can act irrationally or inconsistently and regret it later. Even when we try our best, with the best of intentions, things can go wrong. Events don't develop along straight lines. Beginnings and endings are often blurred and uncertain. Apparently random elements are always intruding. Does that mean a film that has those qualities is disorganized and frustrating or true to life? We've seen this story, or something like it, before Man madly in love with wife loses her in childbirth, struggles to rebuild his life, encounters massive problems with care of the baby before finding Ms. Wrong Nanny who of course turns out to be Ms. Right Number Two. Why should anyone watch this one? MY reason for watching it is that I will watch anything with Samantha Mathis in it. Why should YOU watch it? Well, it's English, very much in the style of Richard Curtis's films such as Four Weddings And A Funeral, Notting Hill and Love Actually. It even has the same gimmick of an American woman in London (Amy, the Mathis character). But while this film has her plus a very strong British supporting cast, the disappointment is at the center The Grant in this film, Richard E., is just no match for Curtis's Grant (Hugh); or maybe he was disastrously miscast. The Curtis films, while having as many pieces as Jack and Sarah, manage somehow to put them together better, and even when those films are just sort of noodling along, the hilarious one-liners are enough to keep the viewer going until something actually happens. Jack and Sarah's script is just not up to the caliber of the Curtis films. I would like to have learned more about how Amy (the Mathis character) wound up in London, or why she was working as a waitress. I would have liked to learn more about Jack's (Grant's) job as a solicitor As with Ally McBeal, L.A. Law and The Practice, no actual work ever seems to transpire in the office. The most implausible element is the transformation of the character William (Ian McKellen) When we first see him, he is an alcoholic bum living on the street, and the next thing you know, he is living in Jack's house in the position of a very propah butler or butler equivalent. I suspect some intervening scenes didn't make the final cut.

The story is believable but certainly not including the babysitting bit which is completely unthinkable and irresponsible. How could the father (Jack) ever leave his young baby to the new nanny ( Amy) who doesn't even know how to change nappies, let alone making bottles and preparing cereals? This kind of cinematic 'baby-abuse' has always bothered me. How could the grand-parents leave the vulnerable newborn lying nakedly( not even with a clean nappy on) beside a unconscious drunk man who has never been a father for one day? He could have accidentally turned over and smashed the baby or swept her off the bed. It's misleading and DANGEROUS. I'd have enjoyed watching Judi Dench and Ian McKellen more if I hadn't had to worry so much about the baby. Stop treating babies like lifeless properties!

It's not very good compared to movies like notting hill, two weeks notice or you've got mail. From a romantic comedy I suspect romance and comedy. I found this more a drama with a few romantic and comical pieces in it. There are funny elements in this movie (Jack for example is very funny with the baby sometimes) and there is some kind of romance in this movie, but the two leading actors don't make me believe they really like each other. It is not a bad movie, it was good for a nice evening of watching television, but it is not the movie I will watch over and over again. Nevertheless I like Richard E Grant in this movie, he and the baby make this movie worth watching. I'm curious about other movies of him. "}]
