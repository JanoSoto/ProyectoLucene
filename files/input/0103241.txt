Still,you cannot watch this film without feeling like Murray's complete abandon in this film is what gives this film its pep,spark and life. This might be one of the more energized performances of his long and well-padded career.Dr.Leo Marvin(Dreyfuss,who has settled into being the 'Uptight fuddy-dudd' roles from here,as opposed to the more restive,youthful roles of past movies like Jaws and Goodbye Girl)seems to have it all. Loving wife,healthy,normal kids and a career that is on the verge of taking offa comfortable private practice in New York and a self-help book about to be published nationwide. At the last minute,he accepts another colleague's patient(for whom he does not wonder as to why his peer is so breathlessly trying to pass this patient off to him)one Bob Wiley(Murray). Bob doesn't have anything wrong with him;he has MANY things wrong with him. Multiphobic,clingy and more than a little under-developed in his sense of emotional attachment,Bob misreads the good doctor's brush off(As the doctor gets ready for a Labor Day getaway with his famille)as being a cure-all,and is immediately smitten with the doctor's methods,approach,diagnosis and treatment. He decides he's going to insinuate himself into Dr.Marvin's life(in somewhat of a mixture of gratitude and need),and follows him to the rural,New England lakeside vacation where the Marvins are staying.Alvin Sargent and Laura Ziskin's story and script make the actors' moves and lines so easy you'd almost think there were elements of improvisation. But Murray and Dreyfuss are(and not to belabor a point here but...)the key here. Murray's socially oblivious and free sense of bonding clashes DRAMATICALLY with the button-down professionalism of Dreyfuss' doctor,and as Muray thinks himself Better,Dreyfuss' shrink seems to be getting worse,confounded by his unwanted patient's persistence and loyalty. While the unabashed enthusiasm of Murray's character might drive away some viewers who might see this as annoying or too much, Murray fans and,I think,fans of sort of odd,non-formula comedies will DEFINITELY appreciate the whole story and rhythm of this film. Perhaps it's a bit too early to state this(though this film,which I first caught in the theaters in first release sixteen years ago,has had more than a decade to simmer in the memories of moviegoers),I feel this is something of a modern comedy classic. I've seen this film no less than three times and,to chime in with an IMDb message board poster,this IS a truly re-watchable movie. "},{"Title":"Hysterical! A film that can be watched over and over.","Date":"5 September 2006","Score":"17 out of 20 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" I personally think that this irresistible film is one of the best comedies of the 90's, though with this one, I can safely say that that's just my opinion. This is a movie that is so funny, that it never loses it's ability to make you lose control of your motor functions, even after the 15th viewing.Bob Wiley (Bill Murray) is a lovable, but deeply troubled man who has probably the biggest multi-phobic personality you could imagine. He also has a habit of getting really attached to people within the first few minutes of meeting them, and it's heavily implied that he's driven multiple therapists out of business due to his annoying dependency. And the successful therapist/best-selling author Dr. Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss) is about to be the next victim. After his first interview with Dr. Marvin, Bob is immediately attached, and is worried when the doctor leaves for a month long family vacation, preparing for a promotional interview on Good Morning America. Bob cleverly tracks down Dr. Marvin at his lake house, and instantly becomes good friends with the rest of the family, while the doctor doesn't approve. Bob soon becomes a house guest who acts like a part of the family, and is 100% oblivious to Dr. Marvin's sinister hatred of him...Totally brilliant premise, that is very well executed. I still do think the ending, while still funny, could have used some work. Bill Murray is at his absolute best here. He's such an over-the-top, yet believable character, who you just wouldn't be able to resist how friendly he is. Richard Dreyfuss is in my opinion the funnier of the two. His facial expressions just scream repressed rage, and his loss of sanity, slowly occurring throughout the movie, is perfectly timed. You barely notice his personality change. It just happens. One minute, he seems like the ideal therapist, but before you even realize it, he's a sinister maniac, who now requires more therapy than Bob. Bob on the other hand, goes the opposite way. By driving him crazy, he unwittingly manages to become saner, and conquer many of his fears. And has absolutely no clue how much Dr. Marvin hates him, even when Dr. Marvin has extreme outbursts at him right. Dr. Marvin couldn't possibly express his annoyance more clearly, and the idea of his rage never crosses Bob's mind once.That is where the movie gets it's humor. Even as he unwittingly humiliates someone on national TV, Bob never loses his charm. The interview scene is in my opinion, one of the all time classic comedy moments, and director Frank Oz just nails it. In the hands of any other filmmaker, the scene could have deteriorated into mindless slapstick. Bob humiliates the subject of the interview just by being Bob. And believe me, he is not someone you would want to be guest interviewing with. It's amazing how funny it can be just by watching a family grow to love someone who the man of the house hates with a passion, and getting mad when the dad acknowledges his annoyance. I highly recommend this laugh-a-minute comedy, and give it 8/10.It is rated PG for Language, and Thematic Elements. It would easily be rated PG-13 today, even without the language.

He's a lovable enough guy, though, who talks to his goldfish and has an otherwise amiable disposition.Murray is able to draw a fine line between being obnoxious (which he certainly is to Dr. Marvin, played by RICHARD DREYFUSS), to being a charming oaf who wins the approval of the doctor's vacationing family after faking his own suicide with the man's answering service in order to learn where the doctor's vacation spot is.Of course, all of its grossly exaggerated--as any story would be that deals with a man who drives his own psychiatrist crazy, or at least over the edge, as Murray does. By film's end, Dreyfuss is a wreck of a man who even goes so far as to attach explosives to Murray to get rid of him! And naturally, all of his schemes to rid himself of this clinging neurotic are useless. Murray turns up like a bad penny even after the doctor has assumed him dead--and the vacation home is reduced to zero in an explosion.Hilariously funny material is given a real boost by the performances of Murray and Dreyfuss, who play off each other with goofy insolence and, at times, in touching and poignant ways. Murray hasn't given this fine a comic performance since GHOSTBUSTERS and Dreyfuss matches him every step of the way.Julie Hagerty is fun as Dreyfuss' feather-brained wife who enjoys the amiable side of Murray's personality and his utter unpredictability--the very qualities that drive Dreyfuss further and further off his rocker.I found myself laughing out loud at some of the shenanigans--and all of it is very worthwhile to watch and totally unpredictable.

Could live be any better? It could, but it's about to get worse. Enter Bob Wiley, a paranoid, obsessive-compulsive man with multiple phobias ranging from elevators to diseases. He feels that if he fakes Tourette's Syndrome, he won't actually get it. And he carries his goldfish with him everywhere he goes. Bob met with Leo that afternoon and he spelled out his twisted life, involving his divorce over his wife liking Neil Diamond. Leo taught Bob to not worry so much about the big things, but to instead take baby steps. He gave him a copy of his book, then they parted ways. Leo left for Lake Winnipesaukee with his family, but soon enough, he started receiving phone calls from Bob who requested another session. Leo refused him...twice. Not until he returned from vacation. Bob was overly-determined to speak to Dr. Marvin, so he pretended to be a detective and told the exchange switchboard operator that Bob Wiley committed suicide and managed to get Leo's address from her. When Dr. Marvin heard of Leo's alleged suicide, he was saddened...for a minute. He didn't want it to ruin his vacation.Bob reluctantly boarded a bus, another of his many phobias, and headed for Lake Winnipesaukee, Maine. Once he arrived, he immediately tried to locate Leo by screaming his name in public. Leo was anything but pleased to see Bob. His efforts to dissuade him and send him back proved futile. Bob managed to charm Leo's wife Fay, daughter Anna, and son Sigmund. Bob went sailing with Anna by tying himself to the mast, and he taught Sigmund how to dive. All the while Leo was upset about Bob getting involved with his family and despite his protests, Bob ate dinner with them and spent the night. The next day, the Good Morning, America crew arrived to film Leo. They insisted Bob be in it too. Bob tried unsuccessfully to make Leo look good, but instead he upstaged him. A humiliated and infuriated Leo coaxed Bob into the car where he dropped him off at a mental institution where he stayed...for an hour. He charmed the staff so Leo had to take him back. He tried ditching Bob again on the way home, but he got a speeding ticket as well as a flat, Bob hitchhiked and beat him home.Leo had had all he could take of Bob and suffered a nervous breakdown. It was time for drastic measures. He broke into the general store and stole high explosives. He coaxed Bob into the woods where he tied him up then strapped the bombs over him. Bob, thinking this was a genius form of therapy, managed to get himself untied then walked the bombs back to the house...which detonated 10 minutes later, blowing the Marvins' beautiful summer home to bits. Dr. Leo Marvin suffered a severe nervous break-down and catatonia after that. But the real salt in the open wound was that Bob met Leo's sister Lily and the two just hit it off, so they decided to get married. Leo's will to object at the wedding drove him out of his psychotic state and returned him to normal. And so, Bob, Lily, Leo, and the family lived happily, and sanely, ever after.What About Bob? It's a funny movie! Bill Murray was funny. I normally don't find him to be that funny, but he was sure good in this movie. Richard Dreyfuss was a riot. He was really good too. When the guy from Ghostbusters and the guy from Jaws come together, there's no telling what will happen! Also in the cast Julie Hagerty, the cutie from Airplane!, as Leo's ever-patient wife. The kid from Hook plays Sigmund, Kathryn Erbe is Anna, Fran Brill is Lily, and Roger Bowen, in his final film role, plays Phil, Leo's doctor. Bowen is perhaps better known as Col. Henry Blake from MASH. He passed away February 16, 1996 ironically one day after McLean Stevenson, who played the same role on the TV series. Both had heart attacks; I think the funniest part of the movie is when Leo is shaking Bob awake, shaking him and bouncing him continuously, then the alarm goes off and he wakes up. Murray and Dreyfuss made a great team. So if you like either of them, or you like director Frank Oz (performer of such famous Muppets as Fozzie, Miss Piggy, Grover, Animal, etc.) or you like comedies of this genre, then What About Bob? is for you. It's entertaining to watch as Bob improves psychologically, while Leo becomes more and more unstable. From 1991, What About Bob? I recommend it.

The most recognizable of comedies that had this kind of set up were films like Ben Stiller's dark comedy The Cable Guy (1996), Duplex (2003) or Kurt Russell's Captain Ron (1992). Both of which were about main characters' mental issues that somehow were able to get away with everything, meanwhile simultaneously annoying the living crap out of the person they cling on to. This is no different on a narrative level; the formula is all there. The only change are the leads, their positions on the social ladder and the location. The real element that will win over its viewers will be Bill Murray - if you're a big fan of him.To be realistic it is not a bad performance and Bill Murray doesn't play the worst character. However, he's still not that likable. In fact, none of the characters any actor plays is that likable. The day before Dr. Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss) leaves for vacation, a fellow psychiatrist transfers one of his patients, Bob Wiley (Bill Murray) to be checked out. After visiting Dr. Marvin, it is revealed to Bob that Dr. Marvin is going on vacation. With that, Bob does everything he can to see his Dr. again for psychiatric help. Tom Schulman best known for writing Dead Poets Society (1989) and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (1989), penned the script for this comedy with the legendary Frank Oz directing.The strange thing is, like stated before, the execution isn't anything new. The direction is too well known - crazy person introduced to potential host, host becomes victim of crazy person's antics while nobody else believes them. Unlike The Cable Guy (1996) and Duplex (2003) which were mean spirited comedies and Captain Ron (1992) being more dimwitted than anything else, this just plays out irritating. Thankfully, Bill Murray's character wasn't written to be mean spirited, in fact his role is more innocent by nature. The problem is he just doesn't take a hint when someone says leave. With that Bill Murray comes off as more obnoxious than anything else. He's not sick-minded or a jerk, so that kind of makes him acceptable but not likable really because there's little to sympathize for. Bob could be a likable character if he was written more as a character than knows he's causing trouble but can't help it. Instead, Bob causes pain to others and doesn't even notice it. Then again though, that may be due to his dumb surrounding characters.It truly is amazing to how oblivious people can be. Since when are family members so accepting of a professional's patient to show up on vacation, sleep with them in the same room and eat at their table. Not to mention teaching their kids bad words. Doesn't that raise a couple, if not more than a couple red flags? Haven't they heard of the phrase, don't bring your work home with you? Dr. Marvin seems to be the only one who notices and understands that. It's weird because everyone else is so accepting of Bob and yet they don't deal with him in the same manner as Dr. Marvin. Plus, some of the smallest things Bob does everyone finds it hilarious, especially Mrs. Marvin (Julie Hagerty) who is quite annoying too. Saying MmmmmmMMMMmmm after every bite of food at the dinner table really stirs up that many chuckles ? It's because of their lack of concern and care for the victim that makes them unlikable as well and contain no charm. Clearly stated in the movie, one of the reasons why people like Bob is because he's fun and old man Dr. Marvin wasn't. Maybe writer Tom Schulman was trying to get the message across; that you can't live life being a stick-in-the-mud all the time (meaning relax now and then). But aside from one subplot about Dr. Marvin's son trying to learn how to dive, there is no indication of Dr. Marvin being a father who can't have fun. The only reason why nobody finds Dr. Marvin fun is because he's trying to get rid of a patient that is following him and can't get rid of. Wouldn't that make you act rotten too? These supporting characters are so thickheaded. The only actor that is funny on occasion is Richard Dreyfuss. The reason for this being that even going back to the years of Jaws (1975), when Dreyfuss got frustrated, his yelling was more comical than it was dramatic. Nonetheless, since this is a comedy, Dreyfuss is funny in a number of areas because his character has no other way of dealing with the problem (being Bob). Cinematography this time by Michael Ballhaus wasn't anything important, it doesn't showcase much. The music however, composed by Miles Goodman is alright, although it does sound very close to that of his more popular score a year later from The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992). It's not terrible but it isn't good comedy either, unless you're a true Bill Murray fan.Hardcore Bill Murray fans should have no problem with this but if you tire of formulaic host comedies where some crazy person makes everyone turn on the already label victim, it'll be a frustrating sit. It's not the worst because Richard Dreyfuss is funny and Bill Murray's role isn't mean spirited, but the whole play out is just annoying to sit through anyway.

The point is that exaggerated praise can sometimes harm a perfectly good movie because people read these reviews and think this is going to be Airplane! or Duck Soup or something, only to find it's just a funny movie that is not the defining moment for anyone involved. It's good and it gets better as it goes along but please keep expectations reasonable. Nobody is reinventing the wheel here.

Doctor Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss) is a confident NY psychotherapist who is looking forward to a Good Morning America appearance to push his book. A colleague pawns Bob off to Leo as a new patient. Bob is immediately attached to Leo and his book's advise of Baby Steps. When Leo tells Bob that he's going on vacation with his family, Bob can't take it and tracks him down. Leo thinks his life is great, but not everything is going as well as he supposes. His townie neighbors hate him. His son is afraid to dive. His daughter hates to be over-analyzed and has normal boy troubles. His wife could do with more consideration from Leo. And worst of all, everybody loves Bob.Bill Murray and Richard Dreyfuss make for a great odd couple. They are both doing something within their skill sets. Bill Murray is especially wacky in this, and Dreyfuss plays annoyed very well without being completely unlikeable. One could certainly understand Leo's point of view, but it's also obvious how wrong he is.

In here, the former 'Ghostbuster' star is Bob Wiley, a good-hearted obsessive-compulsive who tracks down his new psychiatrist when he goes on vacation with his family; his annoying but good-hearted actions, coupled with the doctor's upcoming TV interview, cause the man to slowly go crazy himself.I find this film rather polarizing, exactly because of Murray; or, to be more precise, his character. Bob Wiley is good-hearted and enthusiastic to a fault, to the point of being obnoxious. You can't help feeling sorry for the psychiatrist (a very good Richard Dreyfuss) for having to put up with him. And Murray, himself, does a great job; he is not obnoxious in an overly cheerful/clownish way (like Robin Williams, for example), but rather in the comedic OCD way his character is supposed to be. His is merely great acting; a bit TOO good acting, though, as sometimes I myself felt irritated with Bob.Richard Dreyfuss does a very good job too. His character, an overly-uptight and arrogant 'genius' psychiatrist, is shown in a way that we should feel he deserves the hell Bob inadvertently brought him; yet, because of Bill Murray, we can't help sympathize with him. Still, his breakdown moments are hilarious and the interactions between Dreyfuss and Murray are perfect.The supporting cast exists, but it is really Murray's and Dreyfuss' show.In the end, it comes down to how you cope with Murray's character. Whether you can stand him and laugh, or whether you find him so irritating to the point of being unbearable. I certainly found it quite funny and liked it, and would not hesitate to recommend.

Bill Murray's different attempts to commit suicide) Avanti and one,two,three are no pure comedies either (although some might not agree with me) They have obvious political (and other) undertones. The point is The story of What about Bob is so outstanding funny,that only the story of Groundhog day tops it. Other reviews wrote already about this story,so there's no need for me to do it again. What I,however,want to write about is the performance of the both main actors. Bill Murray played very well-as in Groundhog day.I read that at first Robin Williams should have taken over the part of Bob Wiley,but,frankly speaking,I can't imagine that he could have replaced Bill Murray properly. The performance of Richard Dreyfuss however was really outstanding and might have come as a surprise,because Dreyfuss,in contrast to Bill Murray,wasn't known as an excellent comedian.But maybe exactly that was the reason for his excellent play? A weaker performance than Dreyfuss' one (as Dr. Leo Marvin) could have easily spoiled the whole movie,despite the funny story and despite Bill Murray.The interaction between Bob Wiley and Dr.Leo Marvin is,in my opinion,absolutely essential for this movie.So,very well done,Richard! I read,that Bill Murray and Richard Dreyfuss didn't get along with each other very well during the making of this movie.Well,this might have additionally improved the mentioned interaction... Psychotherapists might not like this movie.After all,doesn't this movie make fun of them? Yes of them,and NOT of -let's say mentally challenged-people like Bob Wiley.Apart from that I remember Karl Kraus' words psychoanalysis is exactly the disease which it believes to be the therapy for One of the highlights of this movie is,in my opinion,the scene with Good Morning,America If you were Leo Marvin,could you ever forgive Bob Wiley?Which raises a question (a good one to be discussed in the forum,in my opinion)Who would you prefer as your neighbor,Bob Wiley or Leo Marvin? It's easy to say Bob Wiley.After all,this answer makes a good impression-didn't't several reviews portray Leo Marvin as a negative character? However,after giving it a longer thought,I nevertheless would prefer Leo Marvin,because I believe it would be possible to ignore him,if he really was an unpleasant character.However ignoring Bob Wiley...do you really think it would work and that he would ignore YOU?...

And no, I don't know this because I was an inmate.It's the story of two men - Bob and Dr.Leo Marvin. Bob is a man so tied up in his obsessive compulsions he can barely move. Thus he works at home in NYC and lives a simple life. However, he does see the value of therapy and apparently has been through a number of psychiatrists, all of whom he pesters to the point that they pass him off to someone else and leave town.The latest doctor to be duped into taking Bob (Bill Murray) as a patient is Dr. Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss). He has precisely one session with Bob, gives him a copy of his latest book - Baby Steps, and tells him he will see him next month because he is going on vacation. This sends Bob into a panic because the one constant in his life has been his tenacious hold on his series of psychiatrists. Bob's decision - he will baby step his way to New Hampshire and go on vacation where Dr. Marvin is.Now you see, Bob is actually quite likable to anybody who is NOT a psychiatrist, and he quickly bonds to Dr. Marvin's family and even helps the Marvins' son with some of his hang-ups in a way that Leo has never been able to do. You also have to realize that, like Bob, Leo is a guy with a lot of rigid rules about everything himself. In many ways he is as hung up as Bob is, but in socially acceptable ways. The result is that Bob violating all of Dr. Marvin's rules slowly drives Dr. Marvin nuts, while basically adopting Dr. Marvin's family makes Bob much better.I'll let you watch and see how this all turns out. Let me just say that this is not One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest - it is a comedy for the entire family and a very good one at that. A ten year old could watch it and not be stressed. Kids much younger than that could watch it, but they just might not get it. Highly recommended.

This is one essential element which can help viewers to know more about a doctor and his patient as two distinct individuals with clear ideas.

One of the famous quotes from Mary Chase's play was Doctor I've wrestled with reality for 40 years and I'm happy to say that finally I've won out over it. Is Bob cured in the end? Is the psychiatrist really a paranoid personality disordered individual? Or is it better to experience individuals as individuals rather then placing them in a DSM-diagnosis box, and labelling individuals this way or that?

This movie would be great when explaining some traits of obsessive compulsive disorder, such as when Bob has problems opening and closing doors, is very afraid of diseases and germs and uses a Kleenex when opening doors and using phones. If this is a comedy or a tragedy is up to the viewer to decide; and if this movie is an accurate depiction of serious mental illness or traits of serious mental illness is really up to patients/consumers of the psychiatric community and/or psychiatrists to decide.

Your classic Murray character has an ongoing, silent conversation with his audience, telling his own story quite apart from the film he's been dropped into.What about Bob?, directed by Frank Oz, is one of Murray's weaker comedies.

Murray inadvertently drives Dreyfuss mad and Dreyfuss, of course, inadvertently cures Murray. The film plays with traditional doctor/patient roles further even at the start of the film Murray is in many ways less mentally ill than Dreyfuss, who is narcissistic and bitterly unstable.The film's plot echoed its behind the scenes goings-on.

Basically Bob 'Bobby' Wiley (Bill Murray) is the good-natured but highly troubled man, he has multiple phobias, is very neurotic, and has ultimately irritated many doctors who try to treat him. The latest psychiatrist to be referred to him is New York based and egotistical Dr. Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss), he quickly sees why Bob has got on so many doctors' nerves, he is unknowingly annoying, and as he is going on vacation with his family he for the moment refers him to his Baby Steps book. Bob tries to live with the advice of the book, but being highly reclusive, and seeing Leo as his hope for a better life, in desperation he takes the drastic action to use manipulation to find him while on vacation. He finds the doctor and his family, wife Fay (Airplane's Julie Hagerty), son Sigmund 'Siggy' (Hook's Charlie Korsmo) and daughter Anna (Kathryn Erbe) in a peaceful New Hampshire lakeside cottage. Leo is gradually becoming increasingly angered by Bob's constant intrusion, but his family are embracing the man who they say as just desperate for help, and they are charmed by his kind personality and sense of humour. The big reasons Leo doesn't want Bob around are because he is expecting a television crew to be visiting the house to interview him about his Baby Steps book, and of course his family seem to be spending more time with his patient. It comes to the day of the television interview, and Leo is humiliated by Bob appearing with him, the highly annoying man does give good face to his book, but of course the doctor is not as admired, and he really snaps with his patience. Leo has had enough of Bob, and truly going berserk he plans to kill Bob, and even though he was unaware that his family kindly told him to go, he takes Bob out into the woods, tying him up with explosives. After seeing this as some kind of treatment and way to see that he can go on without Bob returns to the house, after managing to untie himself, but he also left the explosives in the house, and in the end Leo only comes out of his catatonic state after Bob gets married to his sister Lily (Fran Brill). We are unsure how the rest of the story will pan out afterwards, but the final text also said that Bob was bringing out a book called Death Therapy, and that Leo was suing him for the rights. Also starring Tom Aldredge as Mr. Guttman, Susan Willis as Mrs. Guttman, Roger Bowen as Phil and Brian Reddy as Carswell Fensterwald, M.D. Like Caddyshack this is another completely different character for Murray, normally playing sarcastic and witty, here he is unknowingly funny and highly annoying to people and his antics cause chaos for Dreyfuss, who is also good as the control-freak doctor slowly going insane with hatred for him, it is a good simple concept of the slightly crazy patient turning his doctor crazy, and it makes for some good physical and dialogue jokes, a fun comedy.

He is utterly dependent on the support of his counsellor, and has the annoying habit of hooking his dependency hooks into such people more or less instantly on meeting them. So, although Leo thinks he has successfully divested himself of Bob by introducing him to the Baby Steps concept, he is annoyed to discover that all he has managed to do is give bob a tool which enables him to leave the city and follow Leo to his holiday cottage on the lake. This is particularly annoying as there is to be a TV interview at the lake house to publicise the book tomorrow morning. It is even more annoying when he finds that his family (including his son, who has hangups which his father has caused, rather than cured) like Bob very much.This very funny movie is based on the joke that Bob gets saner and Leo gets crazier, and each causes the change in the other. Bill Murray's Bob is delightful - yes, he is annoying, but he is desperate to please, he is prepared to work hard at improving himself, and he is a nice guy.

It does not seem like his other work&#x97;not exactly, though he has a history of great work. Frank Oz, director of The Indian in the Cupboard and of numerous Muppet productions, directed. Bill Murray, Richard Dreyfuss, Julie Hagerty, Charlie Korsmo (who apparently is a genius), Kathryn Erbe (later from Law and Order), and everyone else (of course). I mention everyone else because players of large parts to small give radiant, believable performances. Think of Tom Aldredge and Susan Willis as Mr. and Mrs. Guttman. Think of Marcella Lowery, as the switchboard operator. The sense that these are people one might actually know seems to be an important aspect to the effectiveness of the movie. Mr. Murray and Mr. Dreyfuss justly earned high praise for their work here, but again this is an ensemble work. Still, it is hard now to think of Woody Allen, Mr. Oz's first choice for Dr. Leo Marvin, being right for the film&#x97;at least, now after we know the work of Mr. Dreyfuss. German cinematographer Michael Ballhaus, who worked with Fassbinder of all people, never intrudes into the manic playfulness of this movie. That a Fassbinder photographer shot this film somehow amazed and amused me. Master British film editor Anne Coates makes the cinematic narrative tight and fluid. Read her list of editing achievements. The restrained musical score by late Miles Goodman, understated against the manic force of the screenplay, goes almost unnoticed. You might recall his work with the television series James at 15. The location shooting was not at Lake Winnipesaukee. My nephew attended high school near there. Fall came too early for the shooting. Instead, the location is at Smith Mountain Lake near Moneta, Virginia. The location works well. I have no idea how this ensemble created this charming, almost picturesque movie. It is not romantic like many great films by Woody Allen or Bringing Up Baby. It is not anarchic. It comes close to but never transgresses that limit. It comes close to nihilism with an odd sweetness but never becoming quite sentimental. Chaos looms at the edge but the decency and honestly to Leo's family keeps that from every happening. The film seems unique to me. I do not know of any other work quite like it. Those who have seen Mr. Oz's The Indian in the Cupboard know that this picture is not some sort of accident or stroke of luck. It is an effective criticism of shallow popular psychology. It is not a put-down of psychotherapy. I find in it a vibrant joy that recalls that of Bringing Up Baby, another one of my favourite comedies. Like screening that classic film repeatedly, watching this one just improves with multiple viewings. Leo, I see salt and pepper. . . is there a salt substitute? Perfection!

Besides, I used to frequent therapy sessions, so I would like to see how cinema used to portray this kind of relationship. However, in my humble opinion, What About Bob? is just unfunny. Instead of having several hilarious scenes, like most Frand Oz's movies, we have plenty of irritating scenes in which the psychiatrist is discredited for all his family and friends. I know, it was supposed to be funny, but Dr. Leo Marvin is SO wronged that we feel actually sorry for him-- I do, at least. Also, Bob is an implausible character, given that sometimes he's extremely paranoid about getting diseases and dying, whilst in other times he just plains dumb, like when the doctor fastened bombs all around him.

(1991) *** (out of 4) Bill Murray plays the obsessive-compulsive Bob, who finally cracks and ends up following his new psychiatrist (Richard Dreyfuss) on vacation. Once at the vacation resort Bob finds himself getting better by getting closer to Dreyfuss' family but soon the psychiatrist is the one losing his mind. This film often gets overlooked and while it's far from a classic I can't help but find it mildly amusing in its own way due in large part to the two leads. This is certainly Murray's show from start to finish but all of the supporting characters set up the jokes for him but Murray is the one hitting them out of the park. Just take a look at the scene with Murray and the family around the dinner table when Murray keeps making annoying sounds. The viewer might find Murray annoying while doing this but the way the family reacts to him is the reason we see him so lovable. I think just about any actor in Hollywood, past or present, would have turned Bob into an annoying character so the credit has to go to Murray for never crossing a certain line that would turn the viewer off. Instead Murray makes him very lovable and most importantly makes him funny. Dreyfuss never really gets enough credit for his comic timing but he works very well with Murray here and the two make for some great laughs. The movie starts to run out of steam during the final fifteen-minutes and I've never been a fan of the ending but this is a nice entertainment for the family. "},{"Title":"What Indeed","Date":"21 December 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" In 1991, Bill Murray was the king of comedy and could do no wrong. 'Scrooged' still lingered warmly in people's memories and while 'Ghostbusters II' had not duplicated the success of the original, it wouldn't be exaggerating too much to say that Murray had much to do with the attention it did receive. Little surprise then that Hollywood felt they could contrive any storyline no matter how hackneyed, throw him into its polluted waters, watch him soar to the surface and make the whole endeavour swim. For 'What About Bob' is a very by-the-numbers sojourn to Odd Couple territory, while at the same time taking the somewhat disturbing premise of a highly invasive stalker whom we are encouraged to think of as 'wacky', while the victim, by cleverly stripping him of all but two dimensions, is painted as the antagonist, and whom is expected to 'correct' his viewpoint until he finds his tormentor as lovable as the rest of the characters. You can almost hear the director encouraging the audience with 'Come on, look at Bill Murray's face. Isn't he silly?' And in response, Richard Dreyfuss as Dr Marvin groans and seethes in frustration, only to be admonished by his wife in much the same way that Sylvia Field did with Joseph Kearns thirty years earlier in 'Dennis The Menace'.Essentially, the film requires you to side with the lead character as misunderstood not because of any reasons the script may suggest, but because it's Bill Murray, and Bill Murray is funny, and anyone who doesn't agree is apparently taking it too seriously. Not one of us! Not one of us! Which is presumably just as well, since any deep - and by deep, I mean shallow end of the kiddie pool - analysis of the premise invites frustration and dare I say it, madness. And Bill Murray is funny. He had me in 'Ghostbusters'. The man has wit and presence. He's someone you want to watch. Richard Dreyfuss, meanwhile, makes for a perfect Mr Wilson, getting almost Jon Lovitz in his delivery at times. Maybe this is 'Dennis' for the 90s, and who better than Frank Oz to direct the whole endeavour away from 'Girl, Interrupted' territory like Cookie Monster side-stepping sugar addiction by rolling his eyeballs around like a damaged gyroscope? There were times I did find myself laughing very much with the leads, moments where their talent managed to rise above the constrictions set in place by the undecided mish-mash that was the direction to good effect.I do think that any and all themes should open their doors to comedy, so I can only conclude that the fault lies in the execution, the attempt to produce simply unoriginal, cookie-cutter cinema, while a more intelligent approach attempting to understand its material could have satisfied my comedic expectations. The hand of Harold Ramis seems an obvious choice, as the director of the far superior 'Groundhog Day', not to mention the screenwriter of 'Analyze This' (an equally formulaic, but more assured production). And I'd still have wanted Bill Murray. Either way, the major Murrayphiles will doubtless be entertained by what they do find here. After all, there are two types of people those who polarise viewers' opinions of 'What About Bob?' and those like myself somewhere in the middle. Wait, that's not it...

When this fails Bob manages to find the Marvins' address and turn up unannounced. When the rest of his family take to Bob, Leo finds he is stuck with him while the TV interview gets closer.Just in case you are in any doubt about where this very obvious comedy is going let me just say that I might not be able to avoid spoiling this for you. I have put a spoiler warning on the review but to me nothing I'm saying cannot be foreseen by any casual viewer after only 10 minutes of running time. Suffice to say that Bob endears himself into the family and teaches Leo himself lessons in life. The narrative flow provides nothing of surprise or particular interest along the road to the obvious and it is hard to really get engaging in it due to the total lack of spark or wit in the script. The delivery itself feels very safe, very middle-of-the-road but for constantly aiming for the safe middle the film winds up being pretty dull and lacking in anything that is that funny or sharp. Sure, it is amusing enough if this is what you want but I couldn't help feeling that it was just plodding along with very ho-hum material.So far so what, but what annoyed me somewhat was the waste of the talented two leads. At one or two points Dreyfuss and Murray work really well off one another but for the majority they are working with average characters and average material. They deliver with energy and talent but generally the tools aren't there for them to do anything that special even if I did appreciate their efforts. The support cast are somehow cast at the tvm level even if they do a so-so job. When the only other face you recognise after the lead two is Airplane's Julie Hagerty then you know you are in the sh1t &#150; beyond her the only person I knew was a guy from Oz as the TV show director.Overall then a very middle-of-the-road comedy that lacks anything that sharp, interesting or funny. I wanted it to be more than it was. The two lead actors also want that too but, despite trying really hard, the material just isn't there for them and the support cast aren't able to do anything to help them out.

Usually, these are comedians, brought in to enliven an otherwise dead vehicle.But sometimes we get an actor who has made the very risky choice of always taking that  in-between space, the space between the movie and us, and using it to create a dialog  quite apart from the story in the movie. Bill Murray - since `Groundhog' - has made  this choice, and developed some tools to pull it off.That's why Wes Anderson, and other filmmakers who play with that space (Jarmusch,  Coppola) like him so much.That's why he was cast as Polonius in the radical `Hamlet' of 2000. And that's why he's  in this trifle. The form is a conventional one unlikely interloper seeds wisdom. But the  business about analysis gives Bill his lever to have that analytic hidden dialog with us.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.

His character is a psycologically disturbed man who grows overly dependent on his psychiatrist, played by Richard Dreyfuss, to the point that when the psychiatrist goes on vacation with his family, Bill's character tracks him down at his vacation home and just can't take the hint that he isn't welcome to come around while the good doctor is on vacation, although the doctor's family seems to have the opposite feeling for Bob. They   grow attached to the guy and welcome him in almost as part of the family.In the end, it was good to see how Bob bonded with the family so much that not only were his own psycological problems indirectly taken care of, but he also managed to inadvertantly take care of some of the younger son's emotional and psycological problems. Bob and Sigmund (played by Charlie Korsmo) became almost like brothers, even to the point that when Dr. Marvin wanted peace and quiet, Bob was Quiet and Siggy was Peace (big chuckle).Try seeing the film with the family.

At first, Marvin is professionally helpful but aloof until Bob ingratiates himself onto him AND his family at their New Hampshire vacation house, by the end Bob finds himself growing more free from his restrictions as the good doctor seems to adopt some phobias all his own, paramount among them being Bob.As Marvin, Dreyfuss plays an arrogant know-it-all boor whose above-it-all air is put to the test by the earthy good nature of Bill's Bob.  As the doctor slowly freaks out and loses his cool on an ever-growing basis, Dreyfuss shows himself to be an expert at the slow burn, which he masters all the way through this movie.Of course, Hagerty plays Marvin's quiet wife Fay very well, wondering what in the world he could have against such a nice guy as Bob.  Korsmo, as the death-obsessed son of the doc is great and has a terrific line about his obsession (Maybe I'm in mourning for my lost childhood.).The Good Morning, America interview is a classic scene, as are the scenes with venomous locals like The Guttmans (Burn in H**l, Dr. Marvin!) and such simple scenes as Bob saving Dr. Marvin from choking, going on a New York-to-New Hampshire bus ride and making such tired gags as dry heaves funny twice (nice going, Bill!).It's an ensemble piece, all right, and this ensemble makes it all worthwhile, with Frank Oz' distractingly laid-back direction a major asset throughout.

Dr. Marvin introduces Bob to a new method of self-discovery and a feeling of control by name of Baby Steps, Dr. Marvin's new bestselling book. Bob feels so great after this appointment that he can't bear the fact that Dr. Marvin will be gone on vacation for a month. So, Bob, desperate as he is, decides to do whatever it takes to be with Dr. Marvin. After several failed attempts to weasel the information of where he's staying out of Dr. Marvin, he finally hits on one-- a suicide attempt-- and finds out that the residence of his home is at Lake Winnepasakee. So Bob, afraid of being alone, ends up, to the psychiatrist's utter dismay, at the doctor's lake house. Bob innocently becomes the houseguest who always has some reason to stay, will never leave, and greatly endears himself to the family-- all but Dr. Marvin himself. Dr. Marvin will do anything to get rid of Bob, but every time Bob just thinks it's some kind of new therapy. Through the movie, we see Bob without meaning to turning bad into good, while on the other hand gradually driving Dr. marvin to insanity! This movie never gets old.

Bob drives Marvin increasingly to grasp at straws as he tries some peace and quiet away from the overtures of the patient who seems to be replacing him in the affections of his wife and children. The film depends on the hangdog likability of Murray, and the obliviousness of the Marvin's family to their patriarch's insecurity about this intruder's inroads on their affections. Dreyfuss deserved more credit for his performance. His role requires a performance in which the performer's emotions are increasingly directed internally. Marvin does not want to openly admit that he is threatened by his amiable patient but at the same time, this is part of the nuisance that Bob embodies-that and the fact that he will not leave his therapist alone on vacation. Dreyfuss is very good at depicting both of these strands of his character's personality. He should have received more credit for a masterful performance. In fact, the Academy should recognize such skill. But unsurprisingly, this does not happen. My primary reservation about this film is that his family is so oblivious to his insecurity. Admittedly, his character is made self-sufficient, accomplished, and arrogant, but all that said, it is astonishing that they do fail to see the emotional burden that is building up in the head of the household. He is quite clearly more and more annoyed and they are on vacation. His irritation should not be so hard to understand. That said, the two leads' performances are excellent and the ultimate endorsement of their ability is that, as unlikable as Marvin is, you start to sympathize with him as the movie continues, so irritating does Bob become. This is an enjoyable and light-hearted comedy from a masterful director in Ivan Reitman (who mines similar territory several years with equal success in Analyze This and who also helmed the excellent Bowfinger, another excellent comedy). Reitman has an excellent understanding of the nature of his material and makes all the right points and elicits excellent performances from Murray who is hilarious as the patient in need of psychiatric help and from Dreyfuss.

What's wild about the way he does it is that Bob projects the utmost innocence and sincerity all the while. Any fan of Murray's work will instantly see the parallels between Bob and his roles in movies such as Ghostbusters or the SNL Awful Lounge Singer.Dreyfuss plays a surprisingly excellent straight man as Bob's (not entirely) hapless shrink, given that Dr Leo is himself a bit of a caricature (a bit obsessive about his book, for instance).

However, as we all may know, that type of relationship goes against the rules for a doctor/patient relationship. We must take into account that this reflection of the relationship was merely for entertainment purposes. No doctor in his right mind would allow one of his clients to interfere with his day to day routine, and especially during vacation time. I also can't believe that a client would go so far as to follow his doctor to his vacation spot just to get some help. I should hope that the client would get alternative help from the therapist suggested by his primary therapist. As for Bob and his problems, the doctor mentions he has multiple-phobia personality. I do not believe that is an actual diagnosis, but he did fear many things and he was also a bit obsessive compulsive. Bob had to do things a certain way, for instance not touching things with his bare hands for fear he'll catch some sort of disease. Also, the doctor had a bit of a controlling problem. He wanted things to go his way and if they didn't, he would have a nervous break down. I think the doctor was a bit egotistical as well. He seemed to care more about his book, then he did his own clients and helping others. I'd like to hope that there aren't psychiatrists, therapists, or psychologists who are like that.

People talk about What About Bob? as a Bill Murray comedy, but the best performance in it is that of Richard Dreyfuss, who generates sympathetic frustration with the audience as Dr. Leo Marvin and carries the intricacies of the plot in a way Bill Murray never has to. More to the point, Dreyfuss manages to do this by simultaneously underplaying and overplaying his role. He simmers effectively at the dinner scene and on Good Morning America, then goes the other route and outhams Herbert-Lom-as-Chief-Inspector-Dreyfus in the Pink Panther films as he introduces Bob to the wonders of Death Therapy.The other surprise is that this was a Tom Schulman script. Yes, as in that guy who wrote the schlocky Dead Poets Society and won an Oscar for it, actually put together a funny, coherent, movie-ready storyline that makes for one of the best comedies of its time. Shut me up. You are that good. Just not in that movie.The best part of this aggravation comedy is that it's not certain who you will identify with. Bob is clearly a good-natured, harmless type, and you are rooting for him from the beginning. Yet it's hard not to see Dr. Marvin's side as his patient takes every liberty permissible. The scene that brings me over to Bob is when Dr. Marvin gets the call about his suicide, then claps the light off with the bromide that it shouldn't ruin his vacation.But it's no good being so bloody-minded. The fact is Dr. Marvin isn't so bad for a shrink; he deserves better than what he gets at the end. A better comedy would have provided better for our principal nutter, given him a happier out than what he ends up with.I especially like the family, particularly Julie Hagerty as Mrs. Marvin.

Richard Dreyfuss plays Leo Marvin a great psychologist famous for his baby steps theory. Bob visits Marvin, who informs Bob he is going on a family vacation and will schedule an appointment when he arrives back. Bob, being the impulsive man he is, hunts down Marvin via various techniques, all the way out to Leo's family vacation spot in a sweet old town in the middle-of-nowhere. Soon, Marvin realizes that Bob is not going to let him go--so Marvin snaps, and goes crazy. He can't stand Bob. Bob is unintentionally gaining the favor of his children and wife, and he also spends the night at Marvin's house. Marvin loses it. Bob doesn't stand a chance. Or does he?This film comes off more as a horror than anything. In fact, it would have good potential as one. But instead we are treated to an equally-compelling comedy that loses steam and credibility at the end. Fortunately, the first three-quarters of the movie makes up for the last quarter.Bill Murray is the perfect choice for Bob a sweet, good-natured man with a kind heart. He doesn't intentionally cause mayhem in Marvin's life; he just does.Richard Dreyfuss surprises as Leo Marvin. Who would have thought that the man could be so funny?And Frank Oz, director of Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, Bowfinger and I believe voices characters in Sesame Street, directs this film just right. There's a side of lunacy, paranoia, cartoon, but most of all family in the way he presents everything and everyone.I particularly like one scene where Marvin's child (that kid from Hook) is going to bed; Bob is sleeping in the room with him, and they have an intimate conversation regarding death. Bob gives the kid high hopes for a future without really trying to per say. Not only is the scene ironic, but it's a bit touching.Unfortunately, the last twenty minutes or so rapidly excels towards over-the-top craziness. It's a bit like the ending of Clifford with Martin Short and Charles Grodin they both would be more fondly remembered without the bad endings.Overall a fun film, that would have been about ten times better without the ending it contains. It still has a great re-watch factor, however, and scenes like the dinner at Marvin's house plenty make up for the bad outcomes. On the plus-side, comedies like these really aren't made anymore.3.5/5 stars -John Ulmer "},{"Title":"This movie rocks!

"},{"Title":"Chasing the blues away","Date":"6 March 2003","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  There are two obvious pitfalls a successful comedy really must avoid.  One is sentimentality and the other is silliness.  Both present serious temptations for the movie makers, the writers and the director.  In the case of sentimentality, they must ask themselves how a comedy can be any good if it isn't about something.  If it doesn't have a serious component, it can't be any good, right?  And movie makers too often overreach themselves and fall into the trap.  (As Good as it Gets has a dog crying in one of the sad scenes.)  Not that sentiment and comedy can't be successfully blended but unless you're Chaplin it's usually not worth the attempt.  As for silliness, well, somewhere on the slope of that pit lies The Brady Bunch and its sequels, and, near the bottom perhaps, The Jetsons.What About Bob? teeters on the brink of the Brady Bunch Pit at times but never topples over.  The story is the kind that a committee might come up with if asked to choose a topic for a family comedy.  Guy becomes attached to his psychiatrist, follows him on vacation, makes a nuisance of himself, but brings family together and all ends happily.  Plot number sixteen in the shoebox labelled funny plots.  Actually, this is done pretty well.  The opening sequences poke some obvious fun at Murray's phobias, and there's an amusing scene in Dreyfus's office.  Murray claims that he left his wife because -- There are two kinds of people in the world.  Those who like Neil Diamond and those who don't.  Dreyfus, the shrink, is in therapist pose, cheek propped on the palm of one hand, and he replies something like, Let me see if I understand this.  You're a multiphobic, compulsive anxiety neurotic, and YOU left HER because she likes Neil Diamond?  Once the superficial jabs are out of the way the writers have to work harder, otherwise what they've got is a one-joke plot that has to be strung out over an hour and a half.  The tactic they use is to shift the attention away from Murray's symptoms and focus instead on small-group dynamics.  And they do it successfully.None of the situations, none of the gags themselves, are breathtakingly funny but they are all consistently amusing.  Dreyfus's family bonds with Murray at their house in New Hampshire.  They come to appreciate his endearing child-like quality.  He moans with pleasure over Julie Hagerty's fabulous dinner, teaches Dreyfus's son how to dive and how to stop worrying about death, entertains the daughter, and all the while driving Dreyfus to distraction just by being there.  (Ooops, watch out!  That slope is slippery.)  Finally crazy, Dreyfus attempts to blow Murray up by tying him to a log in the forest and draping twenty-two pounds of black powder over his shoulders, set with a timer to explode in an hour or two.  Dreyfus succeeds only in blowing up his own house, which he filched with a bag full of money from a local couple anyway.  And Murray's character is engagingly dumb.  Dreyfus is his reluctant host at the family dinner.  Hagerty offers Murray another piece of chicken and Murray accepts with fulsome gratitude.  As he takes the chicken, Murray notices that Dreyfus looks up from his plate glaring at Hagerty, and notices too that she scowls back at him.  Completely misinterpreting this exchange, Murray asks Dreyfus, Did you want the breast?  Later Dreyfus marches Murray off into the woods with the intent of killing him, and Murray asks if this is some new kind of therapy.  Yes -- death therapy.  It's a sure cure.  Funny, right?  However, in real life it is no fun to live with someone as neurotic as Murray.  It's a condition that demands a great deal from others.  Trust me on this.  I speak not only as someone who had to live with a neurotic for years, but as a neurotic myself.  Fortunately this movie depicts nothing that resembles real life, where Murray would be more or less disabled by his psychopathology and would find very little to be cheerful about.  (The baby steps therapy, insofar as it's described at all, resembles a technique borrowed from operant conditioning and called desensitization.  It seems to have had a pretty good success rate with phobias.)  If you want a serious undertone you can probably find it in the relationship between Dreyfus and his family.  He's a rich, narcissistic workaholic who, as his daughter informs him, is no longer fun to be with.  He's reduced to a neural shambles by the end of the movie and recovers during a wedding ceremony, but the whole family doesn't rejoice and come together for a weepy group hug, thank God.The plot is so obvious that much of its success rests with the actors and they pull it off.  Murray has often been painful to watch, as if he thinks that vacant smile is itself amusing.  But he does a good job here.  And so does Dreyfus as the straight man who is turned into a figure of laughter.The kids can watch this and they'll probably get a kick out of it.  You don't have to know anything about psychiatry because the jokes don't get into it.  Adults will probably enjoy it too.  Nobody will pop a gasket laughing, but the film is consistently amusing.  These days, that in itself is enough to make anyone tear up with thanks.

But there is only one problem the good doctors is going on a months vaction and won't be able to treat Bob until he gets back. Not being satisfied with this Bob shamelessly does everything he can to try to find out where Martin is staying including getting some girl off the street to pretned she is the doctor's sister and pretending he is an agent investigating the suicide of Bob and must see the doctor for questioning. Once getting the adress he embarks on his journey to find his good Dr. Martin is less than impressed to see Bob show up to interupt his vacation and does all he can to get Bob to just go away but that is harder than it appears. After an elerly couple who dispise Martin for buying their dream house that they were saving up for give Bob a lift to Martins doorstep everyone falls in love with Bob but Martin who wants him out of his life. But with the presense of Bob and the good things that seem to follow him everywhere he goes shows that maybe it is really Martin who is the one in need of a little therpy. The results are very warm-hearted and often hilarious as you instantly fall in love with Bob and even Dreyfuss is often times more annonying than he is funny and Murray is typically goofy there is nothing not to love in this great light hearted comedy that is sure to please the whole family.

Dreyfuss is Dr. Leo Marvin, a widely respected psychiatrist whose fame is spreading after writing a best selling book about therapy, while Murray is Bob Wylie, an extremely neurotic new patient who is afraid of life itself and who can't let go of his new doctor, even after Dr. Marvin goes on vacation. The supporting cast (which includes Julie Hagerty as Dr. Marvin's wife, Fay) is solid, but the movie really revolves around Dreyfuss and Murray.The most impressive thing about their performances is the way in which they are able to flawlessly exchange roles in a sense. Beginning with Dreyfuss as the completely focused psychiatrist and Murray as the unbelievably crazy neurotic, over the course of the movie the roles change, with Dreyfuss ending up as the insane one and Murray as the normal one. It's fascinating (and funny) to watch Dreyfuss portray Dr. Marvin slowly slipping away, while Murray is perhaps even more subtle in showing the changes in Bob - changes that become obvious by the end of the movie.In short, this is great comedy, and features two superb performances from two fine actors.

Bob finally met Dr. Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss), a narcissistic psychiatrist whom he thought could cure his disorder. However, Dr. Marvin is going on vacation and he wont be able to see Bob until a month later. The exciting story begins...From a general viewer's perspective, I thought this movie was very comical; mainly because of Bob's annoying character and his multi-phobias and because my ex-boyfriend has obsessive compulsive disorder. Bill Murray did an excellent job portraying a person who has obsessive compulsive disorder. Although he has multiple phobias, Bob was very lively and seems to be very optimistic about life. He taught Siggy that there's worse fear than death, like Tourette's syndrome. I thought that was straight-up hilarious. However, there's one thing that still confuses me. Is it that easy for someone who has obsessive compulsive disorder to get over his obsessiveness and compulsiveness that quickly? Thus, this leads me to the conclusion that Bob does have obsessive compulsive disorder, but only to a certain extent because it seems like once he finds someone that he trusts, all his fears seem to set aside. Bob needs to be around people; he has the need to connect to people, especially how all his previous doctors neglected him. This shows in the scene where Bob was walking back to the Guttman's house, and he said to himself I'm alone... But it was ironic that Dr. Marvin's family needed Bob in their lives too. being a psychology major, I thought this movie does not depict any truth about psychiatry. First of all, what kind of therapists show fear towards their patients? Well, maybe if the patient is trying to harm his therapist. But in Bob's case, the therapist that was treating Bob before he handed Bob to Dr. Marvin was afraid to continue treating Bob because he wouldn't leave the doctor alone? Another thing I would like to point out is Dr. Marvin's abuse of authority when he put Bob into the institution. In addition, It was wrong of the head of that institution to accept Bob without pre-screening. Furthermore, I thought it was ironic when Dr. Marvin had his manic attack and a colleague of his (Dr. Phil I believe) was going to prescribe him Prozac, then Bob suggested to prescribe Librium instead due to the symptoms that was shown by Dr. Marvin, and Dr. Phil took his advice!?!? Having a nonprofessional prescribing drugs was pretty absurd. This movie stereotyped psychiatrists as people who don't really want to help their patients; they just want to popularize their names and sell their books. Dr. Marvin haven't actually help Bob one bit. He kept referring to his book Baby Steps.Although this movie is a comedy, I still think they need to try to make the movie not too hollywood. There is more to psychiatry!!!

No gut-busters, but a LOT of smiles.  If a movie can achieve that for me, I'll enjoy it.  I don't think I just smiled at a movie as many times as this one.  I laughed hard a few times, but found myself grinning a lot, with one of those Ohh, no! expressions on my face.  Mostly because the film plays on those kinds of situations, with Murray---a cloying, co-dependent psych patient---always stunning his new shrink with embarrassment.  After a lot of digging, Murray finds out where Dreyfuss is vacationing.  Based on Dreyfuss staring at him and making only one assessment during an initial meeting, Murray deams Dreyfuss a genius.  So he's really intent on beginning the doctor-patient relationship with him. Dreyfuss makes many attempts to brush him off, but Murray won't give. I'll stop there since that is the basic plot repeated for the ninety minutes, and get into some of film's minuses the fact Dreyfuss' family---and everyone on the island for that matter---take an instant likeing to Murray is unrealistic.  He's either annoying or weird around people, which should turn them off.  Now most of the time, they are absent when he's REALLY weird or annoying, which is witnessed by Dreyfuss.  But even the family dinner scene for example, should've turned them off.  Murray's endless Mmm, mmmmmmm, mmmmmmm while eating would make any sane person put-off.  There also two near fatal mis-steps for the film the first would be Murray's initial consultation, which runs far too long, and lacks laughs.  In watching recently I was wondering how I ever got through it.  Then there's the finale, which lapses into mucho contrivance, with attempted murder and exploding houses.  Tack on Murray marrying into the family and I'm sure the theater was rolling its eyes.  It's as if screenwriter Schulman got stuck for a final fifteen minutes and said Ah, what the hell, let's throw credibility out the window!.  The two stars later said much of the dialogue was ad-libbed, and it's not surprising.  At times with one of them stammering for words, or reiterating a joke over (I sailed, out on the water, away from the doc, on the water, in the wind, off the land, ya know...)  And also that those close to Dreyfuss---his family and a later colleague---would let him get away with SCREAMING at them is far-fetched. But the film generates enough amusing zaniness for a recommendation, as long as you're not expecting high-larity. "},{"Title":"Superb comedy!

I prefer Murray as the comedian. As the straight-guy, I can't seem to buy into his performances. Bob Wiley (Bill Murray) has problems. Life in general is almost impossible and social interaction is all but impractical for him. He fears...everything. A divorced basket case who claims his wife left him for Neil Diamond, he has no prospects for work, love, friendships, or any of the human comfort we all need...except the attention of his diverse assortment and long string of psychiatrists.Dr. Leo Marvin (Dreyfus) is the unlucky psychiatrist who is next in line in the treatment of Bob's many severe phobias. But just as Bob begins to reach out, he discovers that his new friend is going on vacation.In a fit of depression and mania, he tricks Dr. Marvin's answering service into giving the location of his whereabouts and shows up in the center of town, screaming desperately for Dr. Marvin.Dr. Marvin arranges to contact Bob at the restaurant in town under the agreement that Bob will return to the city. The Marvin family is surprised by Bob's knock at the door, and they immediately fall in love with his quirky, lovable character. Dr. Marvin, who is none too happy about this development, starts driving a wedge between Bob and his family.Unfortunately for Leo, the family fails to understand his concern and dotes on Bob, creating an even stronger bond than the one Bob has already developed in his mind.In a last-ditch effort to rid himself of Bob for good, (and because Leo feels betrayed by his family in favor of a mental patient) Leo betrays Bob's trust in an attempt to have him committed. By this time, Leo is a definite candidate for Dr. Buddy Rydell's unorthodox intervention. (See Anger Management for the low-down on Dr. Buddy Rydell.) This effort backfires and the results are hilarious and snow-balls down hill for Leo from there.The wonderful, classic Bill Murray style colors this gently jaded comedic endeavor. I thoroughly enjoyed this work. Some have said that it mocks those experiencing mental problems, but if anything, it endears them to our hearts. Watch the movie and you, too, will love Bob.It gets an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend .

The characters aren't interesting or developed, and the co-stars are weak all around. Julie Hagerty is a likable enough screen presence, but has never impressed me as an actress (with the exception of the spoof Airplane, in which he shortcomings were turned into assets).There are undeniably some very funny moments, not because of the script but because of the two stars precise comedic timing.

I haven't heard about any other film with the same premise. The plot is pretty good, and develops nicely. The pacing is mostly good, most of the film is entertaining and interesting. The acting is good, pretty much all the way. Bill Murray and Richard Dreyfuss have a surprisingly good chemistry and compliment each other quite well. The characters are somewhat well-written and reasonably credible. One thing I didn't care too much for was the fact that there wasn't really anyone to relate to... everyone is an extreme. Murray is an exaggerated mental patient, who suffers from just about anything you can think of. And he's the main character... apparently, we're supposed to feel for him, despite the fact that he's more annoying than any other character. Dreyfuss is apparently supposed to be the villain, as he is the only person in the film that hates Murray(who is 'our hero'). Everyone else loves Murray and has different amounts of dislike for Dreyfuss... including his family. I know that that's the point, that the film is supposed to be like that, but when you don't like the main character, every character besides him is paper-thin and empty and the villain is the only slightly understandable character, the film loses a chunk of its audience. Murray has proved that he can be himself, his usual annoying self, and yet make the audience like him in films like Ghostbusters and Groundhog Day. Why couldn't he be like that in this one? The film almost fails as it has little to no memorable parts and none of the characters are particularly likable. However, the humor does work, most of the time, and this saves the film, together with Dreyfuss' and Murray's on-screen chemistry. I recommend this film to fans of Bill Murray and his type of humor.

Bill Murray, as Bob, suffers from multiple phobias and, after an initial brief interview with psychiatrist Dr. Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss), he becomes so dependent on him that he pursues him to where the Marvin family is away on vacation. To set up the premise of the movie Murray plays Bob initially as mentally disturbed, but his personality quickly changes into that of an irritating, socially inept child. Bob ingratiates himself with Marvin's family while in the meantime driving Marvin nuts. Unfortunately I came to view Bob pretty much as Dr. Marvin did - his behavior was totally inappropriate and I wished he would just go away. It is beyond me why Marvin's family did not also feel this way. In an era when the work of Freud has been greatly discredited this movie seems compelled to propagate the stereotypical image of a psychiatrist as one who worships at the feet of the master, having busts of him in his office and in his vacation home, and even naming his children Sigmund and Anna. Things turn absurdly silly toward the end.Outside of its contrived humor not being particularly funny, the reason I really dislike this film is its portrayal of mental illness for humorous effect. Anyone who has known a phobic person understands the pain and suffering caused by the illness and knows that there is no cure by taking a few baby steps over a period of a few days, as implied in this film. The same criticism goes for making fun of Tourette's Disorder.
