[{"Title":"A misinterpretation","Date":"21 April 2003","Score":"105 out of 139 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" This is an inventive and artful production of Oscar Wilde's play, but I can confidently say that were Oscar Wilde alive today, he would be appalled at the misuse to which his play has been put. Indeed I think I feel the ground rumbling as he rolls over in his grave, and yes he is actually spinning in anguish.Oliver Parker, who directed and wrote the screen adaptation, simply misinterpreted the play. He focused on the dashing young bachelors when the real focus of the play is Lady Bracknell, the absurd and beautifully ironic representation of the Victorian mind who was then and has been for over a hundred years Wilde's singular creation and one of the great characters of English literature. She is supposed to steal every scene she is in and we are to double take everyone of her speeches as we feel that she is simultaneous absurd and exactly right. Instead Judi Dench's Lady Bracknell (and I don't blame Dench who is a fine actress) is harsh and stern and literal to the point of being a controlling matriarch when what Wilde had in mind was somebody who was both pompous and almost idiotic yet capable of a penetrating and cynical wisdom (so like the author's). Compared to Dane Edith Evans's brilliant performance in the celebrated cinematic production from 1952, Dench's Lady Bracknell is positively one-dimensional.The point of Wilde's play was to simultaneously delight and satirize the Victorian audience who came to watch the play. This is the genius of the play the play-goer might view all of the values of bourgeois society upheld while at the same time they are being made fun of. Not an easy trick, but that is why The Importance of Being Earnest is considered one of the greatest plays ever written. This attempt turn it into a light entertainment for today's youthful audiences fails because this play is not a romantic comedy. It is more precisely a satire of a romantic comedy. Its point and Wilde's intent was to make fun of Victorian notions of romance and marrying well and to expose the mercantile nature of that society. It is probably impossible to translate the play for the contemporary film viewer since a satire of today's audiences and today's society would require an entirely different set of rapiers.Parker's additions to the play only amounted to distractions that diluted the essence of the play's incomparable wit. Most of Wilde's witticisms were lost in the glare of Parker's busy work. Recalling Lady Bracknell as a dance hall girl in her youth who became pregnant before being wed was ridiculous and not only added nothing, but misinterpreted her character. Lady Bracknell is not a hypocrite with a compromised past. She is everything she pretends to be and that is the joke. Showing Algernon actually running through the streets to escape creditors or being threatened with debtor's prison was silly and again missed the point. Algy was hard up true and in need of ready money but his bills would be paid. Gwendolyn in goggles and cap driving a motor car also added nothing and seemed to place the play some years after the fact.The big mistake movie directors often make when making a movie from a stage play is to feel compelled to get the play off the stage and out into the streets and countryside. Almost always these attempts are simply distractions. Some of the greatest adaptations--Elia Kazan's A Streetcar Named Desire from 1951 comes immediately to mind--played it straight and didn't try anything fancy. Here Parker seems obsessed with dressing up the play. What he does is obscure it.On the positive side the costumes were beautiful and Anna Massy was an indelible Miss Prism. Reese Witherspoon at least looked the part of Cecily and she obviously worked hard. Rupert Evertt had some moments in the beginning that resembled Wilde's Algernon, but he was not able to sustain the impersonation.My recommendation is that you not bother with this production and instead get the 1952 film starring, in addition to Edith Evans, Michael Redgrave and Margaret Rutherford. It is essentially true to the play as Wilde wrote it, and is a pure delight.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

He was, she said, the sort of person whose lips moved while he watched television. It's a wicked slight, but I confess to thinking that Oliver Parker might have had that very fellow in mind when he butchered Oscar Wilde's brilliant play to make this awful film.And it's really too bad, because the portents for the production were - on the surface at least - very good. You start with a great play by a great writer, who was also a great humorist. It's probable that only Shakespeare penned more quotable lines than Oscar Wilde did. And even Shakespeare probably did not write so many that were funny. The cast choices also looked good Colin Firth and Rupert Everett as the male leads, the two false Ernests; the formidable Judi Dench as the even more formidable Lady Bracknell; Frances O'Connor as Gwendolen Fairfax; and Reese Witherspoon as Cecily Cardew - Witherspoon doing a creditable Gwyneth Paltrow turn with an English accent.A bankable American star appears to be a standard requirement these days when presenting an essentially British production to viewers on this side of the Pond. Otherwise, so the illogic apparently goes, few people over here would turn up to see it. Of course, James Ivory did very well a decade ago with superb films like Howard's End, and with nary an American star in sight. One supposes that Parker can be forgiven for overlooking that fact after all, he was preoccupied with revving up the editorial chainsaw to dismember Wilde's text.The problem with Parker's approach to the play is that Wilde wrote specifically for the theatre. Language was his tool, and few writers have used language half so brilliantly. The Importance Of Being Earnest is a drawing-room comedy, one of the best in the repertoire, a very funny, extremely literate play about manners, attitudes and conventions in Victorian England. It's a clever and tightly integrated work, a small masterpiece, where dialogue begets more dialogue, wry observations and witticisms proliferate, all of them ultimately spun into a seamless satirical whole.That's not to say that Wilde can't be made into a motion picture. Three years ago, Parker did a creditable, if slightly sappy job on An Ideal Husband. Perhaps buoyed by that modest success, he felt he could take Wilde - through The Importance Of Being Earnest - to a new level. And he has. Unfortunately, the place he has taken it is so far below theatrical sea-level that oxygen is required for basic survival. In hacking the text to ribbons - it seems that almost half of the dialogue has been discarded - he has so compromised the context of the piece that the end result is almost incomprehensible. Think of it as the ultimate dumbing-down of Oscar Wilde.A short list of items in the film that are astonishingly un-funny. Gwendolen Fairfax having Ernest tattooed on her ass in a disreputable London district. Algernon Moncrieff arriving at Jack Worthing's country estate in a hot-air balloon. Algernon leaping in and out of carriages, and climbing through windows, and scurrying down alleyways to avoid his herds of creditors. Algernon spitting food all over himself when he meets Jack at the country house. Algernon and Jack in a wrestling match over a plate of muffins. Jack having Gwendolen's name tattooed on his ass as the credits roll by at the end of the film.Urgent memo to Oliver Parker Oscar Wilde is not about slapstick.It was suggested in an earlier comment on IMDB that if you've never seen the play, as written, you might find Parker's film amusing; but if you have seen the play, you probably won't. That's good advice. Happily, the original 1952 film is available on VHS, and will soon be available on DVD. It was directed by Anthony Asquith. Wisely, Asquith kept his film solidly within the theatre's embrace, even starting the piece with a curtain rising before an invisible audience. And he had an English cast that was to die for - Michael Redgrave, Michael Denison, Joan Geeenwood, Dorothy Tutin, Margaret Rutherford, Miles Malleson. Asquith produced a brilliant film, a triumph of intelligence, style and taste, everything that Wilde and his admirers could have wished it to be - and everything that Parker's film is not.A final note. Shortly after the film was released, Colin Firth gave an interview that was published in The Globe & Mail, a major Canadian newspaper out of Toronto. In the interview, Firth lamented that he lived in a society - England - that pretended to be literate, but in fact was not. The irony implicit in his comment is almost too delicious. I'm certain that Oscar Wilde would have loved it.

His plays are often dismissed as shallow, but they are some of the greatest comedic writings of all time, in my opinion. The witty repartee that Wilde's characters engage in, particularly in The Importance of Being Earnest, is hilarious in most performances.What a pity, then, that this production of it drags its feet like a drunken yeti (Yes, that's right, a drunken yeti. Use your imagination). It is slow and ponderous, where it should be quickly paced and light. It is morbid and dramatic, where it should be witty and amusing. The screenwriter of this adaptation and the director both deserve to be lined up against a wall and shot. And I simply cannot describe what should be done to Colin Firth, who plays an exceedingly dull and moronic Jack Worthington that would never have survived in London society.In a movie that should have had the audience cackling with mirth from start to finish, the chuckles were very sparse. Most were provided either by Judi Dench, who brings some true Wildian spirit to the movie as Lady Bracknell, and Reece Witherspoon as the innocently shallow Cecily (but what the #@$& were those 'knight in shining armor' dream scenes?).Wilde I may love, but not this movie.

It is rather Quixotic... but I think you should try.","Date":"11 June 2004","Score":"15 out of 20 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Wealthy London bachelor Jack Worthing falls for Gwendolen, cousin of London socialite Algy, who has in turn fallen for Jack's ward, Cecily. Amongst other barriers to both relationships is the determination of both ladies to marry men called Ernest, leading Algy and Jack to pretend that Ernest is, indeed, their given name. Another stumbling block is the ubiquitous Lady Bracknell, Algy's aunt and Gwendolen's mother, who refuses to accept Jack as a suitor for her daughter because he was a foundling, discovered as a baby in a handbag at Victoria Station. Playwright Oscar Wilde put into Lady Bracknell's mouth some of the most delicious comments in stage history To be born, or at any rate bred, in a handbag, whether it had handles or not, seems to me to display a contempt for the ordinary decencies of family life that reminds one of the worst excesses of the French Revolution.The story follows the ups and downs and deceits of the two men whilst they pursue Gwendolen and Cecily, dogged by Algy's creditors and Lady Bracknell, whose opposition to Jack's origins proves insurmountable. On the way we learn of Jack's brother who does not exist yet manages to die in a Paris boarding house, and Algy's invalid friend Bunbury who also never drew breath yet nevertheless explodes on the advice of his physician. The situation remains unresolved until the final scene, when all the protagonists have collided at Jack's country estate. This interpretation of Oscar Wilde's play may not suit purists. Oliver Parker takes a few liberties with the original, adding a couple of off-the-wall touches such as Gwendolen having Ernest tattooed on her rear end. None of this detracts from the film precisely because this is a film and not a filmed play and as a stand-alone movie this is highly enjoyable fare and remains graced by Wilde's eternal and inimitable wit.The cast, too, is outstanding. Reese Witherspoon as Cecily mastered an English accent and, along with Colin Firth as Jack, Frances O'Connor as Gwendolen and Judi Dench as Lady Bracknell (Aunt Augusta), is first-rate; the film also boasts Edward Fox, Tom Wilkinson and Anna Massey in supporting roles. Lastly, no-one plays Wilde's nihilistic, aristocratic and insouciant wasters quite like Rupert Everett, who was designed for such parts.Oscar Wilde's play is timeless and priceless and his wit dominates the proceedings; matched to a cast with the acting talent of this troupe, it does not fail. Wilde and English period drawing room comedies are an acquired taste and, for those unsure of their nature, can be distinguished by the conspicuous absence of gunfire, vulgar Anglo-Saxonisms, explosions, wizards, references to def-con 2, giants, breasts, giant breasts and Steven Seagal if any of these is your cup of tea, look elsewhere. If, on the other hand, you want to watch a team of gifted actors delivering with great aplomb some of the smartest dialogue in English literary history, The Importance of Being Earnest is not a bad way to spend an hour or two.Is Miss Cardew at all connected with any of the larger railway stations in London? I only ask because until yesterday I had no idea that there were any families or persons whose origin was a terminus.

How on earth he managed to turn a blithe and sparkling comedy played by a superb cast into a stumbling and tiresome grind is quite beyond me, but he managed it, and in spades.First, he dragged it out abominably. Wilde works best when ripped through at a spanking pace. It's fast and punchy, definitely part of the modern era, but Parker paces it like a funeral procession. Exchanges that are supposed to be quickfire are instead drawled, with irksome yawn-inducing pauses between the retorts.Second, he padded it with some utterly unnecessary flashbacks, that add nothing that's not clearly covered in the exposition. We don't need to be shown it, especially as that just detracts further from the flow of the scenes.Thirdly, even while doing this, he somehow manages to butcher some of the most vital and sparkling scenes with clumsy script cuts, notable Gwendolen and Cecily's first meeting. Instead of a rasping and pummelling duel, we are treated to an insipid and truncated tiff. Why on earth he chose to elide Gwendolen's second statement about her first opinions is baffling beyond all comprehension.Fourth, he apparently failed to notice that the harsh lighting in most of the scenes makes all of the cast, even Ms Witherspoon, look much older than necessary, and certainly older than they should be.Fifth, he shoehorned in some dreadfully awkward and quite out of character physical buffoonery, completely at odds with the tone of the piece.The superb cast is wasted poor Judy Dench is reduced to whispering her character's iconic line, I can only assume in an overly ostentatious attempt to distance this performance from previous Ladies Bracknell. Firth, Everett and O'Connor are all just a little too old to pull off their roles, and worst of all, none of the cast seem to be having any fun during the production.This is a dreadful version of what should be a rip roaring play, that fails and disappoints on every front.

Better to read the play than see this attempt to modernize it and open things up for the screen. It is hard to figure out who the intended audience is for this misfire, since most of those who appreciate Wilde will be appalled and most who do not appreciate Wilde will not likely gain that appreciation from watching this.Why people take a classic play and think they can improve on it is a mystery to me. It's hard to know where to start. First off, the music is more appropriate for a Pink Panther movie or a 20s silent film; its jauntiness drove me nuts. A scene added to the movie that is not in the play has Algernon playing a piano and Jack strumming a guitar while they sing a song Lady Come Down that more appropriately belongs in a Broadway musical. Oddly, so much pride was taken in this that it was repeated in the closing credits.The original play is nothing more than a showcase for Wilde's wit and satire and anything that takes away from that essence is no more than a distraction, and there are plenty of distractions here. We have Cecily fantasizing about a knight in armor who ultimately morphs into Algernon; Algernon arrives at Jack's estate in a hot-air balloon no less; Dr. Chasuble is played as a bumbling obsequious fool in an embarrassing performance by the fine actor Tom Wilkinson. It was when Gwendolen is seen driving across the fields in a backfiring 20s roadster wearing riding goggles that I realized what a true hash had been make of things. Algernon and Jack's fight over the muffins is pure slapstick and annoyingly negates the spirit of their argument and their personalities. In the final scene we have Gwendolen astride a white horse in the drawing room being attended by Algernon dressed in Knight's armor and Dr. Chasuble is dressed in a toga and all characters are being showered with flowers. What were they thinking?Many of Wilde's famous quotes are here, but a lot are left out. For example, in the play Lady Bracknel actually confirms that Jack's real name is Earnest, the name he had adopted as part of a ruse. This leads Jack to respond, Gwendolen, it is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly that all his life he has been speaking nothing but the truth. Can you forgive me? However, in the movie Lady Bracknel is shown to discover that in fact Jack's real name is not Earnest, so his clever retort cannot be made. Why make such changes? The actors give every indication that they are in on the joke, but the real humor of the play is more effective if played straight. I kept thinking about what we would have with David Niven and Michael Caine playing Jack and Algernon.The only positive thing I can say is that the costumes and set decorations are wonderful.The responsibility for this travesty must lie with director/screenwriter Parker.

The witty absurdities tossed off by Wilde's characters can only truly become airborne in a theatrical milieu. An attentively listening theater audience engages in a sympathetic act of complicity with the actors on stage, one in which the delighting ear outstrips the wicked tongue. But a movie camera is an eye, not an ear; it cannot provide the necessary complicity that would allow Wilde's arch dialogue to levitate. Robbed of that complicity, the characters die and the dialogue falls flat. Perhaps it is too much to expect this play ever to be given a 100% successful cinematic make-over.Parker cannot be faulted for trying to translate this play into a cinematic medium; he is, however, guilty of ham-handed 're-writes,' unnecessary excursions, ill-considered excisions, and a feckless attempt to jam his cast into cinematic dress that doesn't fit them and that leaves them looking foolish.Watching this film, I felt badly for all the fine actors ensnared in it. I'm betting Judi Dench has a superb Lady Bracknell somewhere in her... but it isn't on display here.My advice is to skip this movie if you're considering seeing or renting it. Try the much better '52 Anthony Asquith movie with an amusingly rebarbative Edith Evans at the top of her form.

The fantasy scenes were tedious and the script's drastic change from the original dialogue in the middle was of the ridiculous.Firth and his co-stars, which included the fun actress, Judi Dench, seemed to be walking through a reading of the script rather than expressing any true and sincere emotions. And their modernization of the play with the tattoo on the rump seems to be entirely out of place with the strictures regarding the heroine. One of the final insults to the original play is the switch of the brothers and their birth which again confused the entire issue of the plot.Unfortunately, this is one movie that, although clean in nature, has lost a lot of spontaneity that could have evolved with this cast.A dreadful dull bore!

I am a fan of all of Oscar Wilde's work, and I have performed as Cecily on the stage, and this version was sad. While a few of the extra sequences were humorous, the blend of the original version and the version revised by the author was humorlessly arranged, thus creating an unfortunately bland film from a brilliant play. I actually fell asleep partway through the scenes that would be equal to act three/four, depending on the version. Also, I felt that some of the lines were not given with as much expression as they could have been.

But theater is the child of literature, at least English-speaking theater. And film is offspring of some other part of our imaginative being. Literature and theater generally rests uneasily in film, that is unless you simply present a filmed play where the camera emulates a theater audience.That's why I've become obsessed recently with the study of such adaptation -- of Shakespeare, Wilde, Austen and others. Things must go pretty far back in the geneology of the idea for meaningful reinvention in order to make a meaningful film.Here is a special case, made more difficult because the play has changed meaning even as a play from when it was written. The British class system has been reinvented; as with Austen, the film was intended for the same people it pilloried. Also, all the sex has drained out as the subtle tweaks of Wilde have lost their meaning. (`Earnest' meant something like bi-sexual chivalry, and the relationship between the two male leads was ambiguous.)So, what to do? One unavoidable artifact of film is its focus on the face, and in modern times the convention that peoples' motivations are `explained.' Add to that the loss of tone of the banter. The theater can accommodate a snappy cadence. Film cannot, but the comic tone of that banter is the spine of the enterprise.Parker substitutes a comic sound track that annotates every motion. It helps. Helps a lot. He is forced to expand the range of action beyond the original few rooms, and at the same time provide some backstories. So he shuffles and adds. This doesn't impress, but it is not there to do so, merely to qualify the cinematic justification. Where I think this misses is in the women. They are all wrong. Dench does her standard bit. I am really angry at her for torpedoing the really intelligently conceived `Iris,' with her refusal to understand the context of the experiment. So too here she herself is as dimly obstreperous as the character she plays. Please, no more Dench until the part needs the one thing she can do.Reese Witherspoon gets the accent right I guess, but is misdirected. She does facial comedy, but this requires linguistic rubato, the kind of thing that Emma Thompson can do. She's lost. I really like O'Connor generally -- `Mansfield Park' was an adventure. But when you compare this to `Ideal Husband,' (the last Wilde/Parker/Everett outing) you'll see what I mean. That play's language crackled, its pace was carried by the actors, and two of these (Moore and Blancett) were two of the three best actresses in the world of film. They bent to the new cinematic center; they understood where they needed to go and had the guts to go there. They transformed the rhythm of repartee in the play to visually physically rhythm of person.This play is about sex. Everything else annotates, even (especially!) the class and deception jokes. That's been lost. Can we have it back?Ted's evaluation 3 of 4 -- Worth watching.

But in the city he is Earnest &#150; a young wag, a dastardly reputation and a good friend in the shape of fellow bachelor Algy.  However when he wants to marry his urban love Gwendolen he meets opposition from her guardian Lady Bracknell.  Jack tells Gwendolen where his rural home is &#150; and Algy overhears.  Enticed by Jack's description of his ward Cecily, Algy travels to Jack's home and poses as his made up brother Earnest.  However the arrival of Gwendolen puts the cat among the pigeons in a most frightful way that can only be resolved with delightful charm and wit (and some good fortune).It's been a few years since I saw the original and I've never seen the play or anything like that.  So I went to this unsure of what to expect.  Would it be a match for the wit of Wilde or would it pander to a lower sense of humour to try and win an easy audience?  The answer to me was somewhere in between.  The plot is as light and absurd as it should be &#150; but it's all done with such a great feeling of whimsy that you really don't mind the various twists at the end.Wilde's wit is used well and the whole thing is delivered in the manner befitting the material.  However it is the variations that don't quite do it.  Some of the wit has been watered down to the point that it feels a little flat &#150; indeed for 15 minutes I did struggle to get into it because it felt slightly dry at times.  More comical than witty scenes are still amusing but I wanted more clever word play etc.  However what there is is still better than the spate of crude teen comedies that seem to be never ending.  Wilde's wit comes through whenever it is given a chance.The cast are all good.  Everett grated on me at the start as I felt he didn't fit the role but he grew on me very quickly.  Firth also seemed strange at the start as the strict Jack but I very quickly got into him and he was suited to his role.  O'Conner is a delight and, with a good Witherspoon, works her facial expressions well to betray the longing behind her words of rejection.  The scene where the two ladies meet over crumpets to discover both love `Earnest' is hilarious!  Wilkinson is good, as is Massey but actors like Fox should never be underused in such a fashion!  The prize is Dame Dench.  She plays the most unpleasant and unsympathetic character but is easily the best.  In her Wilde's wit is the best transposed and she has many, many killer lines.Overall this is several miles below the classic and does feel a little like Wilde watered down a little to provide more humour that is universal (tattoos etc).  Some of the updates don't work as well as they should (all those fantasy scenes get tired after the first few times) but the wit is still better than much of the dross that passes as comedy recently.  Oh &#150; and Dench steals every scene she's in effortlessly!

In spite of his film-making repertoire being relatively small, Oliver Parker (Othello, An Ideal Husband) does justice to Oscar Wilde's play with a lush and vivacious film adaptation to the nonsensical farce; more than a century later in 2002, it springs to life the hilarious satire of nineteenth century English society. This is due to the nonsensical plot and dialogue, the perfect casting and the settings and music of the film, which allow its audiences to experience the sheer humour of The Importance of Being Earnest. Set in late nineteenth century England, the story follows the amusing antics of two young gentlemen Jack (Firth) and Algy (Everett) as they both adopt the pseudonym of Jack's imaginary and wicked brother 'Ernest' in order to pursue on-the-sly activities. Hilarity ensues when both their respective love interests Gwendolen (O'Connor) and Cecily (Witherspoon) fall in love with the recently deceased &#150; What a lesson for him! I trust he will profit by it! &#150; and non-existent 'Ernest', resulting in a tangle of mistaken identities and deception. However, as the film progresses, we learn that they have been more 'Earnest' than they previously envisaged.In addition, the superlative cast capture the very essence of Wilde's characters, and manifest the wit and wordplay in each line with both class and comedy. Despite being less subtle as the ludicrously earnest Firth, Everett sparkles as the eccentric and sharp Algernon Moncrieff, confidently delivering his character with fluency and exuberant humour. Dench plays the pompous Lady Bracknell with authority and ease; yet, her utter earnestness in candid comments and social criticism is truly entertaining I (do not) in any way approve of the modern sympathy with invalids. I consider it morbid. The supporting cast are also outstanding, performing the many facets of their respective characters with comic flawlessness.Oliver Parker creates lush and over-elaborate settings and music that effectively enhance the exaggerated nature of the film. From the intricate ornaments and overstated decorations in Lady Bracknell's home to the luscious grass of Jack's Hertfordshire Manor House's rolling hills, the sceneries augment the flamboyance in all aspects of the film; this also allows the audience to experience the overstated character of the bourgeois world of The Importance of Being Earnest, which, despite Oscar Wilde's intentions, could not be expressed as clearly on stage. Moreover, the absurdity and farce of the situations is furthered by the music of the film. For example, Jack and Algy perform a bumbling and ridiculous rendition of Oscar Wilde's poem Lady Come Down in order to entreat their lovers to come down and forgive them for their deception; ultimately, it induces the audience to laugh at their circumstances. The dialogue of the film consists largely of shameless jokes, ranging from criticism of permanent invalids to arranged marriages to muffins, all of which inject the funniness of The Importance of Being Earnest. With the exception of the substantial issue of the latter (which takes up several pages), social satire constitutes a major part of the film that leaves nothing sacred such as modern education, which, in Lady Bracknell's opinion, is radically unsound&#133; it would prove a serious danger to the upper classes&#133; (and) lead to violence. This is in spite of Lady Bracknell's hilariously hypocritical line Never speak disrespectfully of Society, Algernon. Only people who can't get into it do that. However, in addition to long discussions regarding muffins and teacakes, Oscar Wilde adds zest with epigrams and one-liners, witty statements that are more than often satirical You don't seem to realise, in married life three is company and two is none. The amusing and mocking epigrams, wordplay and discussions both provide a major source of the humour of the film and drive the plot to keep it fresh and appealing.As a result of the entertaining actors that brings the dialogue and story of the film to life, as well as the physical and aural aspects in its surroundings and music, The Importance of Being Earnest is a brilliant piece of entertainment. It has unquestionably aroused laughter in its audiences, and will certainly continue to in the future.

But of course he is. ( Why, Pacino and company found rich depth of humor in Salome...I had never even suspected...) The fault here lies with the filmmakers, and rests most particularly with Mr. Parker's curious decision to confine his attempts to be funny to self invented scenes of tattooing and ballooning and such, and play most of the actual Wilde as a drama. The line readings are slow, the Polonius light character of Lady Bracknell is given to Judi Dench, an actor of tremendous gravity, the basket scene is played as if it were the unmasking of Oedipus - I kept expecting references to pinioned feet. I haven't even mentioned the anachronistic song number, which wouldn't have worked even had the piece been set in the twenties. Just appalling.I shouldn't complain, I suppose. The piece does have a curious, unintended virtue. The actors, in playing for subtext, and meaning (Lady Bracknell understands the personal transformation Firth intends to symbolize speaking of the death of Bumbury, as she looks deeply into Firth's eyes...I am not making this up), in playing for depth...render Wilde's piece completely clichéd and superficial. It's much deeper as froth. As an interpretation of Wilde's play, The Importance of Being Ernest is an utter failure. But as an illustration of certain of his aesthetic theories, it's priceless...

Granted, Husband is second-tier Wilde, while Earnest is one of his best.Earnest is a tough assignment - a perfect concoction of self-conscious artifice.  As such, it's a greater challenge to adapt to film.  The 1952 version with Michael Redgrave and Edith Evans tried to have it both ways, re filmed play and movie, depending on the location of the action.  But it was extremely well-played.As for this new version, it's one thing to open up a play for the movies.  It quite another to fill the film with a lot of stupid, incongruous, and/or anachronistic elements to artificially update it for contemporary audiences.  For example, Gwendolyn getting Earnest tatooed on her butt; Algie and Jack doing a clumsily staged musical number in a style more suited to the 1920's; the idiotic knight in shining armour fantasy sequences; having Algie and Jack discuss the latter's deception and the cigarette case in the lounge of a bordello with prostitutes on hand; revealing that Lady Bracknell was a music hall dancer (!!!) in the past.  It all smacks of try anything desperation.Parker does get some energy going in the first part of the film, but as soon as the action settles in the country the film goes completely slack.  Comic scenes are poorly staged and edited, and the pacing becomes leaden.  The juxtaposition of Wilde's comic artifice and all these natural settings takes its toll.And the actors aren't always a help.  Frances O'Connor is best, and you feel she could be a first-class Gwendolyn under better circumstances.  Rupert Everett has some very good moments (mostly in the first part of the film), but as the film progresses he sometimes looks bored.  Colin Firth is a rather humorless Jack Worthing, but does have some charm.  Reese Witherspoon is competent, in an American-actress-on-her-best-behavior way.  She gets a couple of laughs, but her acting is two-note.  Again, the poor direction is probably to blame.The biggest problem is Judi Dench as Lady Bracknell, a character who is supposed to be pompous and absurd.  Dench is merely pompous, and comes off as much too piercingly intelligent to utter the kind of nonsense that Bracknell does.  She isn't playing Wilde's character - she's still doing Elizabeth I from Shakespeare In Love.Avoid this film by all means.  It's a real disaster.

I admire Judy Dench as a very accomplished actress, but she was a miserable choice for the role of Aunt Augusta.  She comes across as a mean spirited, always cross spinster.  The exchange between she and Earnest Worthing about his lack of parents and being found in a handbag in Victoria Station was so amazingly without humor, I was astounded.  And to have Gwendolen visit a tattoo parlor was very out of character.  It didn't fit in at all.

However one weekend their tale tales conspire against them and their respective loves confuse them for the same imaginary person and something has to give. The original filmed version did a good job of moving this theatrical stalwart onto the big screen however since there is no money to be made by re-releasing that into theatres the producers of An Ideal Husband have got Rupert Everett back into a nice suit and filmed the the rest of the cast out with as little invention as possible (indeed the risky decision of casting the American Reese Witherspoon leads to a mildly amusing accent reminiscent of Queenie from Blackadder, but that wears things soon enough).The strength of the production values seem to be in inverse proportion to the enthusiasm of the cast (as is so often the case) and each time one of them utters a Wlide witticism they make an expression roughly equivalent to a small dog expecting a treat. This leaves no sembalence of character and if the story has any drive in it then it surely hasn't got any gas to achieve forward motion.

The Importance Of Being Earnest picks you up from the get go and doesn't let you down.The Importance Of Being Earnest, which is based on the famous play by the same title, takes place in 1980's England. The film follows Jack Worthing (Colin Firth), a wealthy young bachelor who resides in the country with a young ward named Cecily (Reese Witherspoon) while making trips as often as possible to London. Such trips are excused by Jack's invention of an ill behaved younger brother named Earnest. In London Jack is joined by an amigo by the name of Algie (Rupert Everett), a gentleman bachelor of equal (if not exceeding) disrepute. Algie's cousin, Gwendolen (Francis O'Connor) proves to be the object of Jack's affection, however she too loves him - as Earnest. Sounds like bliss, however Gwendolen's mother, Lady Bracknell (Judi Dench) refuses to allow Jack's (or Earnest, as they know him) hand in marriage due to his mysterious parental origins.What ensues further is a hilarious tale of mistaken identity.  Algie arrives in Jack's country manor and pretends to be Jack's brother Earnest in order to meet Cecily and falls for her. Meanwhile Jack awaits Gwendolen's arrival. They can't both be Earnest...Director Oliver Parker does justice to Oscar Wilde's play. He takes the play and transforms it to the screen flawlessly. He uses the format of the screen, rather than just transforming the play directly. There is a series of imaginative flashes and musical interludes which blend well. The job of a director is to take the words of a playwright and imagine them. This is something that a true director must do. Parker has a clear vision and follows through it.The more technical aspects of the film help create an atmosphere that is essential to the viewers emotional involvement in the film. What stands out the most in terms of technical accomplishments is the lighting. It actually communicates visual ideas and makes the picture jump out of the scene. The great period costumes, make up artistry and cinematography all really help the picture come alive. If it weren't for the warm and intimate nature of these elements, the viewer would have felt quite isolated from the picture as a whole.The cast is probably the greatest attraction to the film. The cast includes some extremely respectable and often colorful personas.  Tom Wilkinson as Reverend Canon Chasuble, Firth, Everett, Witherspoon, Dench and O'Connor, all turn in decent performances. This is not the most difficult task however, considering the strong humorous text and interesting character. The greatest chemistry is between Colin Firth and Rupert Everett who exchange an ample of witty remarks in their dialogue. Earnest reunited Everett and Parker who have previously partnered on a different Wilde adaptation, A Perfect Husband. From Everett's work here, it's easy to see why the director chose to follow up with him.The Importance Of Being Earnest is mostly a delightful film to watch on the big screen. The setting, the cinematography, the director and the cast all put on a delightful adaptation of Oscar Wilde's play. Although this film is quite well done, unfortunately it's not exceptional. It's a pretty standard Hollywood movie, with interesting bits and battles of the wits here and there. You'll laugh, you'll gasp, you'll delight and you'll go home feeling happy.

Judi Dench. Yeah, the Great Judi Dench (and I do think she's great, in other movies). I sat there wondering what in blazes she was doing to Lady Bracknell, and then it hit me She's playing the subtext, for crying out loud. She's working her butt off to breathe life into the old warthog. The problem is, Lady Bracknell has no subtext. Lady Bracknell is a comic conceit, possibly the greatest ever. But she is not, I repeat, not a human being. She has no life, no backstory. She is just a supremely funny thing, and in no way should we be made to think about the womanly heart beating beneath the artifice.Lord knows the cast is competent (and I would happily watch Reese Witherspoon read from the Knightsbridge phone directory) But for all its hot-air balloons and other cinematic froufrou, this version of Earnest is fatally earthbound. Whatever realm Earnest may inhabit, it is absolutely not the real world, and the more the director shoves authentic settings in our faces, the more this immortal souffle begins to taste like day-old crepes.Go rent the 1952 Anthony Asquith version. It's as artificial as all get-out, and it's so much more real.

I have read it, seen several productions of it and acted in scenes from it. You would think that with this basic material, a brilliant cast, lots of money, a sumptuous production and a truckload of talented people, this would be a great success. WRONG! From the first moments, hearing that totally inappropriate musical score with its strange melange of swing, ragtime and 1920s jazz, all totally anachronistic for the time depicted in this play, the mid-1890s, I knew the viewer was in for trouble. And was I right about that!This was the strangest and most confusing bit of nonsense I have ever seen. This ego-driven production (the director/screenwriter's ego) threw out much of Wilde's effervescent dialogue and substituted campy shtick for it, turning Wilde's subtle comedy of manners into a strangely stupid modern interpretation, complete with tasteless flashbacks and intercuts. I'm surprised this director didn't add a few four letter words, farts and burps, which seem to be the current substitutes for comedy in today's films, stage plays and television. We're spared those here, thankfully, but not much else.I don't know what Dame Judi thought of this chance to immortalize her take on Lady Bracknell. This misguided director turns what could have been a brilliant characterization into a shrill one-note performance. Dame Judi does indignant and imperious very well, but that's not all Lady Bracknell is. And Dench can display these qualities and be funny at the same time, as she does so brilliantly on the BBC series As Time Goes By. This accomplished actor hardly has a chance for subtlety, or comedy, for that matter, in this mess of a film.I was wishing for more, a chance to see a great actor (Dench) in a great play. How disappointing this was.

I love the surreal sense as her daydreams pop up unexpectedly throughout the scenes. And of course Judi Dench is spot on and absolutely brilliant as Lady Bracknell.The film does vary somewhat from the original play (as seems to be what many people are complaining about) but I love the changes. The main differences seem to be quite simply the fact that in the film the conversations take place in different settings to the play, however this is because it is far easier to do this on screen than on stage, and it makes for far more interesting viewing in my opinion. As for the script it is, for the most part, almost word for word the same as the original.This is a wonderful, fun film that I would recommend anyone to watch for some light hearted amusement, just don't try to take it too seriously and you'll love it!

It isn't all set in one room! What a travesty! The fact is that theatre and cinema are different media, and adaptations have to recognise this. There are a lot of lines I miss in this adaptation but one can't put a play of this length on the screen without cuts, and one can't cut Wilde without cutting brilliant one-liners, so it was inevitable that some people's favourite lines would be gone. (Having played Lane myself, I'm attached to his comment that I have only been married once, and that was in consequence of a misunderstanding but the discussion had nothing to do with the plot and would have held up the pace of the film.) The 1952 version is one of the best examples there is of filmed theatre. This is a fine example of a play successfully ADAPTED to film. The scene switches are the only way to maintain on the screen the play's galloping pace. (Dialogue can do that unassisted in the theatre, but film is a visual medium it may seem obvious, but a lot of critics don't seem to understand it. One that I've read has dismissed Kenneth Branagh's _As You Like It_ unseen because it will, er, actually render the Forest of Arden instead of asking the audience to imagine it. That's how blinkered they are.) The design is exquisite and the cast perfect (one expects as much from Judi Dench and Colin Firth, but Reese Witherspoon's flawless accent and extraordinary charm make her perhaps even more impressive, while Rupert Everett, an actor of frankly limited range, is for once in his element as a character one suspects is very like himself.) The additional dialogue is in fact mostly salvaged from the four-act version Wilde originally wrote, while the few lines which are added take care of necessary exposition economically and without the least incongruity.No other filmed version can make me laugh as much as seeing the play live. This one can. Parker, after a disappointing start with _Othello_, has become an excellent film-maker.

Instead of people staying away in droves, young things who get all their education from television seem to think it's quite cute. Essentially, the film becomes a vehicle for the dreamy Colin Firth, who looked to me as if he'd been kicked hard in the goolies just before the camera got to him. And what was Rupert Everett doing playing an evil, wasp-waisted Regency buck in a sinister moustache? He's supposed to be an effete upper-class type, not something between Rhett Butler and the Marquis De Sade! This was the most depressing and disturbing remake I've ever seen. Somehow, I believe that one can't do very much damage to Jane Austen or Henry James by making their novels into films (and some of the film versions have been quite decent). Those who love their books will simply ignore the bad films. But Wilde! To think that we (or at least Parker and his vulgarising minions) can do this to Wilde! You would imagine that Wilde would transfer brilliantly to the screen, in 2002, with all the high-tech possibilities of modern cinema. But no. It makes me sad to think that many people who have never read Wilde will go away from this thinking that he was fascinated by hot-air balloons, tattoos, motor-cars, cameras, and funny looking creditors. Oh yes, and he wrote some mildly funny lines too. Could have got a job doing dialogue for Bond movies if he'd been alive.

Colin Firth (known to us as the good suitor from Bridgit Jones' Diary)plays his usual English uppercrust role.  Rupert Everet also simply reprises his take on an upperclass layabout who is somehow found to be charming, and Dame Judy sleepwalks through her customary iteration of pretentious English nobility.  Reese Witherspoon, apparently inserted into the mix to attract American viewers after her success and resultant fame in Legally Blonde wanders hopelessly about the set evidently enjoying playing dress-up but failing to hold a consistent English accent from one line to the next. What saves the exercise from being completely dreadful is the original cleverness and wit of the original play, which even this leaden mess cannot completely obscure.  In plays of this type, mistaken identities, double entendres and wild melodramatic plot twists amused audiences of a simpler time.  The play itself is still brilliant, but transposed to the movie screen largely lacks the fast-paced dialogue and delivery on which it so depends.  The elaborate manor house settings and period costumes are pretty to look at, but the film rings hollow, (when you can actually hear what's being said) and it drags unnecessarily.  Then again, the whole thing was unnecessary, but probably sold enough tickets, and I suppose to them that's what's really the most important thing of all.

Algernon Moncrieff (Rupert Everett) lives primarily in the city, while his good friend Jack Worthing (Colin Firth) lives primarily in the country. Jack calls himself Earnest when he is in the city, so Algernon calls him that. Jack also uses the name Earnest to refer to an imaginary brother who lives in the city and always needs assistance, giving him an excuse to go to the city. Similarly, Algernon is always leaving the city to attend to an imaginary friend named Bunbury.Jack is in love with Gwendolen Fairfax (Frances O'Connor from Artificial Intelligence AI), who lives in the city and therefore knows him as Earnest. Gwendolen's mother is Lady Bracknell (Judi Dench), who is also Algernon's aunt. And the final main character is Cecily Cardew (Reese Witherspoon), who is Jack's ward, and who Algernon introduces himself to as Earnest. This of course makes sense to Cecily because she knows of Jack's brother (but obviously not that he is imaginary).There is more to the story, but I don't want to give away too much, not that the story is really the important thing anyway. This is a comedy and not a serious period drama, and what makes it work is the dialog, which is based on the play of the same name by Oscar Wilde and adapted for the screen by the film's director, Oliver Parker. I enjoyed it more than I expected to, but I have not read the play or seen any other adaptations. My wife, who has, was disappointed, because apparently too little of Wilde's words remain in the finished product.The acting talent is first rate, including, in addition to those mentioned above, Tom Wilkinson from In the Bedroom. They do very well with the material, but it's so light you don't think about the skill required.The bottom line is that this film is a good choice if you are looking for something frothy and entertaining, yet respectable, and you keep your expectations fairly low.Seen on 7/15/2002.

One wonders what Mr. Wilde would have thought of the film.

That genius survives in this film version of The Importance of Being Ernest, albeit with music that clearly comes from a much later period than Wilde's life.  In that sense Wilde's witty play like the recent Moulin Rouge is simultaneously anchored in a given time and subtly cast loose from such restraints.No more witty observer of the human condition wrote in English between the time of Shakespeare and that of Oscar Wilde.  His bon mots reflected cynicism but also a genuine and gentle appreciation of the absurdities of the human condition.As a stage play, The Importance of Being Ernest, without music, requires sharp talents so that one Wilde epigram after the other strikes home.  In a movie version his sayings emerge semi-independently, to some degree softened and isolated by beautiful sets, animals and focus changes and closeups.  So be it.Colin Firth and Rupert Everett shine as the two lackadaisical, spoiled and bored gentlemen.  In their own way, each is the late nineteenth century representation of the English character occasionally played to perfection today by Hugh Grant. Dame Judi Dench is marvelous - has she ever been anything else?  As a titled lady looking out for the future of her lovely charge, well-played by Francis O'Connor, she brings that very special whiff of aristocratic just-below-the surface opportunism that often passes as a fair representation of the English upper class.And then there's Reese Witherspoon, enjoying an adjournment before returning to court in the forthcoming Legally Blonde II.  Without joining the debate on her English accent (or butchery of same), she's cute and engaging and does no harm.This film is no substitute for a fine theater production of a timelessly enthralling comedy.

Jack returns pretending that Ernest is dead and hilarity ensues. Then Gwendolen runs away to be with her Ernest which is quickly confused with Cecily's Ernest.From Oscar Wilde's 1895 play, this still retains some of its sense of a fun romp. The cast led by Everett and Firth is engaging and full of pep. Maybe there is a need to adapt the material more to modern sensibilities. It could improve by getting everyone to the country mansion faster and letting the confused misunderstandings stew a bit more.

So, here we have a good comedy-romance that is based upon a great comedy-satire written by Oscar Wilde. It's not really proper to call this 2002 movie, The Importance of Being Earnest, a version or an adaptation of Wilde's original work. For, while it has the same name, this film has changed the focus, gist and essence of Wilde's play.It does follow a similar plot, but has some major additions. It has segments of original dialog. But it loses its bite and running humor by the breaks from dialog and insertions of other scenes. So, the humor here is in a combination of some of the original script that is kept, and some added scenes. The latter include Algy arriving at Jack's country estate by hot air balloon; Algy fleeing debt-collectors in two scenes; and Gwendolen getting a tattoo on her buttocks. These scenes are modern twists that divert the focus from a satire of the time, and turn it into laughs to support a modernized romantic comedy. As I said, this film is somewhat entertaining from that standpoint. But, movie buffs should not go into this film looking for a poignant satire of England's high society of the late 19th century. This 2002 movie has just a thread of the farce. But its many additions and much revision mostly turn those snippets of dialog into individual funny lines or shots at laughter. They no longer have the bite of farce or satire.The cast of this film has some wonderful actors. Among them are Colin Firth, Rupert Everett, Judy Dench, Tom Wilkinson, Anna Massey and Patrick Godfrey. Most do very well in their comedy roles. The two young female roles by Frances O'Connor and Reese Witherspoon are just so-so. Most modern viewers will enjoy this film.

They're both successful but I think the modern version slightly edges the earlier version out, although it's difficult to beat that 1953 cast -- Joan Greenwood, Dorothy Tutin, Edith Evans, Miles Malleson.The earlier version has a lighter and less subtle approach. Everyone involved seemed to know this was a comedy and it's all very gay and casual.There's more subtlety here, especially from Colin Firth because he plays it as if he were an ordinary, richly embarrassed man. The guy is superb. Anna Massey is great too as the governess. It's making me feel ancient to remember that she was such a goofy-looking but sexy dish in Hitchcock's Frenzy. If you must have a replacement for Margaret Rutherford as Miss Prism, Massey will do. As the two girls involved, Reese Witherspoon is very Aryan and Frances O'Connor is canny.Judi Dench is Lady Bracknell and she has some of the funniest of Wilde's more extravagant lines. When a man is on his knees, about to propose to a girl, she orders him to remove yourself from that semi-recumbent position; it's most indecorous. Even Edward Fox, in the small part of Firth's butler, is exemplary, muttering in his usual obsequious tone as he serves the tea about his overdue wages.The director departs from the earlier format by not shooting it as a staged play. Ladies gallop on horses, men grapple over a bunch of bluebells, the source music is close to ragtime, there are a couple of whimsical fantasies shown that are more colorful than engaging.But -- well, how can you beat those florid expressions?

What concerns me is whether this work stands on its own merits and I'm happy to say it does. With a setting like Jane Austin, star crossed lovers like Shakespeare and mistaken identities like Three's Company, The Importance of Being Earnest is a delightfully funny truffle. The acting is light and wonderfully mannered. The direction opens things up without getting lost in the scenery. Wilde's wit is always distracting. Aside from Rupert Everett glowering at inopportune moments, I can't find much wrong with this film.Jack Worthing (Colin Firth) is a country gentleman in turn of the century England with a beautiful young ward (Reese Witherspoon) and an odd vice. Whenever Jack goes to London to see his old friend Algy Moncrieff (Rupert Everett), Jack pretends to be his own non-existent younger brother named Ernest. Whereas Jack in the country is proper beyond proper, Ernest in the city is almost as big a scoundrel and Algy. Ernest is also very much in love with Algy's spirited cousin Gwendolen (Frances O'Connor), but the imperious Aunt Augusta (Judi Dench) stands in the way of any romance. Though Ernest/Jack is a man of means, Aunt Augusta can't overlook his lack of family. Jack, you see, is an orphan and was discovered as a baby in a handbag left in the cloakroom of a railway station.Hold on, because things just get more complicated from here. Algy heads out to Jack's country estate and passes himself off as the fictitious Ernest in order to woo Jack's ward. Jack's none to happy to be forced into going along with the deception, especially when Gwendolen sends word that she's coming to the country to be with her Ernest. Two men trying to be the same man who doesn't exist turns out to be too much to manage and Jack and Algy are left to try and win again the hearts of the women they love, only to have Aunt Augusta show up and throw another spanner into the machine.From the schoolgirl fantasies of Jack's ward to Algy's efforts at avoiding his creditors to Colin Firth's adorable turn on the banjo, this is one of those movies at which you can't stop smiling. It does enough to establish the strict social mores of its setting but doesn't hesitate to indulge in entertaining anachronisms, like Algy playing a mean ragtime on the piano. With Judi Dench superbly playing the implacable force driving the other characters to exasperation, the comedic energy of the story never settles in one place long enough to get bogged down in any details of realism or plausibility.I will say The Importance of Being Earnest is perhaps the best instruction into why Rupert Everett didn't become as big a star as his talent warranted. Much like the young Alec Baldwin, there's something off putting about him on screen. When Algy acts the cad, Everett can play that perfectly. When he has to moon over Jack's ward, Everett never looks, sounds or feels quite right.Watching this has made me want to go out and see both a stage production of the play and check out the original big screen adaptation from 1952. That's about the highest compliment you can give a film like The Important of Being Earnest and I hand it out with no reservations.

As the ludicrous plot unfolds both men fall in love with women who have always dreamed of loving a man named Earnest. Jack falls for Algy's cousin Gwendolen, played with charm by Frances O'Connor, while Algy falls for Jack's ward Cecily, played alluringly by Reese Witherspoon. But all goes horribly wrong when the women think they have fallen for the same man. Director Oliver Parker, who also directed a film version of Wilde's An Ideal Husband, has gone beyond the text of the play to add more scenes and settings and even a few jokes of his own. He is also very effective in portraying what is going on inside the main character's heads with flashbacks and daydreams seen on screen, again not alluded to in the original play.  The award winning Dame Judi Dench is great as she plays an absolute dragon in Gwendolen's mother, Lady Bracknell, which produces the occasional laugh, but most of the comedy comes from the sparring between Algy and Jack. There is also a humorous subplot involving the local rector, Dr Chasuble (Tom Wilkinson) and Cecily's tutor Miss Prism (Anna Massey). An absolute must for English literature fans, The Importance of Being Earnest is also a period comedy drama of the highest calibre.

They play is 10 stars and the actors did a 10 star job. Spoiler **** the story line is simple if you pay attention to it the first time you watch it. It's about Jack our main character has a pretend brother Name Earnest in town which gets in all sorts of trouble, and Jack pretends to go to the city to help his unfortunate brother Earnest. Jack is free to leave his home when ever he feels like it to visit his friends in the city. He is Earnest in Town and Jack in the Country. In town he has a friend named Algy (which is his brother but they don't know this) Algy often does get into trouble and is always running from bill collectors. Algy has a beautiful cousin named Gwendolyn she is in love with Jack and he her. Except she has this Aunt Lady Bracknell which is very picky who she lets get married. Jack asks Gwendolyn and she consents, but the Aunt says no because Jack has no parents. He was found in a large hand bag in a train station Victoria. Unless he finds his parents or at least a relative he can not marry Gwendolyn.  But the two lovers plan to meet at his home in the country, but there is a problem he has not told her that his really name is Jack. Gwendolyn says to him that she always wanted to marry some one named Earnest!!! So he must 1 change his name or 2. tells her the truth. Algy always wanted to go to the country to meet Jack's Little Cecily (a young lady that is under Jacks care his ward like his younger sister.) So Algy goes to the country to meet Cecily pretending to be whom? Earnest the knotty brother she has always heard of, but never seen. She doesn't get out much, so she pretends a lot; Cecily has pretended that Earnest and she have been together for quiet some time. That they are actually engaged to be married. (You will love this Sean it is the greatest). So Algy of course falls madly in love with her because she is beautiful.Next Jack gets home he pretends his brother Earnest died so he can marry Gwendolyn. But Cecily tells him that Earnest is hear! Jack meets Algy and is very upset, that his dead brother is alive and at his home. Next, the two brothers are gone to take care of some business and Gwendolyn shows up and meets Cecily, where both confided in each other that they are getting married to Earnest and start fighting over him. The men show up and the girls now know the truth. That neither of them are engaged to a man name Earnest (he does not exists). Both of the ladies are up set and go inside of the house. Algy and Jack think about the situation and start fighting over muffins. Eventually the girls forgive them, and the boys decided to get Christened to the name of Earnest for there sweet hearts. Next Aunt Lady Bracknell shows up and forbids the marriage of Jack to Gwendolyn. And who is Cecily? Jack tells her and of course Lady Bracknell wants Algy to marry Cecily because she is rich. But Jack won't let Cecily marry until Lady Bracknell lets him marry Gwendolyn. So both couples can't get married.Next, Miss Prism comes in and Lady Bracknell asked her what happened to the baby she was in charge of 20 years ago. Miss Prism lost the baby at the train station Victoria and the baby is Jack. Jack finds the hand bag which proves that he is the child and to find out his real name he goes through books and His Name is Jack Earnest. Every one is happy because now both couples can get married and Jack knows who he really is.I did leave out a lot of information and jokes but you will simply love the movie. It's so much fun, for every one. It's very Cleaver and entertaining.

The fantasy scenes were a novel touch that would have been more effective if the same technique had not been used for historical scenes (such as putting the baby in the bag), too, which I found confusing as well as distracting from that special effect (which was delightful for the romantic tableaux from Cicely's diary).The screen-writers must bear most of the guilt, too, for changing the plot -- granted, they didn't change it much, but it was enough to befuddle anyone familiar with the play, and for no apparent reason.  (Example Suggesting at the end that Jack hadn't been christened Ernest -- Wilde wrote it with him having been christened Ernest John.)  Not only should you not fix it if it ain't broke, but you shouldn't screw around with it at all unless you're making it better.  (How was switching their order of birth supposed to make this better, pray tell?)Some misguided person(s) must have been trying to make the play more acceptable to modern viewers, but it's a comedy of manners, for heaven's sake! -- if it's not performed in a stylized manner, it misses the point, as this version does.  Watch the 1952 film and then this one right after it, and see if you don't agree.

Many gaffes &#150; the music is out of place.  This, one supposes, is to keep the attention of younger viewers who need a bit of a beat to maintain their attention. As it happens the period of this play was the historical peak of British music performance and composition, a period of imagination, skill and great accomplishment, so it was doubtless impossible to find some energetic yet stylistically correct music or not worth trying.  And, as is customary in careless period productions involving pianos, a spinet has the tone and volume of a 12' grand. Still, who cares? No one will notice &#150; it's not important.This film would appeal only to a viewer who has never heard the complete play.  The dialogue has a few largely harmless additions, but a great many unnecessary cuts and some of these omissions are vivid Wildean dialogue that is greatly missed.  Still, doubtless the screenwriter has a justifiably high opinion of himself and is quite capable of improving Oscar Wilde's dialogue for the benefit of we modern Bourgeoisie.

Although it seems a bit toned down, it still is a very fun movie to watch.  It has various plot twists, and where other playwrights would have stopped early on during the revelation of multiple Earnest, and then slap together some closure with a happy ending, this movie keeps on going, slowing stitching back the relationship together, and it keeps on going to the very end, literally up to the last sentence.The film has some very witty dialogue and interesting word play, although I do feel that the wickedest sarcasm has been mellowed down a bit, either by pacing or just edited out.

This film is an example of one that failed. The actors speak their lines too quickly thereby reducing the delicious nuances that made the original sparkle to rehearsal-style recitation. The male leads acquit themselves the best. The bottom honours must go to Frances O'Connor and Judi Dench, but how could they improve on the performances of Joan Greenwood and Dame Edith Evans? Miss Dench is completely miscast as Aunt Augusta.The film is certainly watchable and better than most of the drivel one sees on the screen these days, but part of the credit for this must certainly go to Oscar Wilde, who wrote the marvellous play.

Someone should have told her she was playing a character of another era, not a bimbo of today's. And then that stuff with her and her fiance getting tattoos. Tacky, tacky!! But Judi Dench was great, but then they had to ruin that by insinuating that she had been a dance hall girl. It was just like they tried to make a sex show out of what is a drawing room comedy. They must not realize that people who go to see remakes of century old plays like them kept in the spirit of what was intended. You would think this was made for teenagers and tacky ones at that.

Overall, it was great and I enjoyed it, though I felt it was really over the top in terms of the visual richness and some of the scenes. The dialogue got lost in places because of the loud pervasive music, which was a shame because the words are the most important thing with Wilde.  It is not a bad thing to have a bit of quiet while people are actually speaking.  I am always impressed by Judi Dench, Colin Firth and Rupert Everett, and they and the rest of the cast did a good job here.  The humour was inescapable and there was real suspense when Lady Bracknell interrogated Jack Worthing.  It was a different interpretation than Anthony Asquith's but lively and gripping to watch.  Being a romantic, I enjoyed the visual references to pre-raphaelite imagery, lavish costumes and gorgeous settings (makes me proud to be British, actually). All the cast were British except Reese Witherspoon and she gave such a good impression of an English girl that she could have fooled me.  Somehow it always seems to be necessary to cast an American lead in a British role(Gwyneth Paltrow is an obvious example) when there are so many excellent Brits available.  Reese was great to watch, but not essential to the success of this film.  "},{"Title":"No, this isn't true Oscar Wilde but I think he may have been amused.","Date":"16 September 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  I must admit I was a bit cynical about this adaptation of one of my favourite Oscar Wilde plays but I had seen Oliver Parker's An Ideal Husband which I thoroughly enjoyed.When I discovered England's excellent trio of Judi Dench, Colin Firth and Rupert Everett were to play Lady Bracknell/Jack Worthing/Algernon Moncrieff, I knew I had to see it.I was rather dubious about the casting of an American and an Australian for the two principal female roles of Cecily and Gwendolyn, and their characters were not fully developed.  I always thought Gwendolyn's character was almost as formidable as her mother was, this did not come across in the film. Reece Witherspoon's modern movements and mannerisms also irritated me. However, just occasionally, I thought she had an expression spot on.However, it was quite apparent that the cast were enjoying themselves (spot them all laughing during the duet to the ladies) and I felt that Colin Firth and Rupert Everett were very well cast as a duo. I thought they interplayed well, (whether it was fighting over muffins or bluebells!) and I know the director took advantage of their previous animosity towards one another when filming Another Country.Colin Firth was inspirational as Jack Worthing, carrying off consummately the scene where he brings back his brothers ashes, dressed ridiculously in full funeral regalia.  He looked absurd but that was the point.  The scene where Lady Bracknell is interviewing Jack is one of the best in the film. This was Judi Dench at her best, and one of the hardest to do especially because everyone knows the `handbag' line is coming up.  I was also relieved to see that there was none of Firth's `Mr Darcy' character showing.I was not wholly persuaded by Rupert Everett, switching from rakish cad one minute to smitten Romeo the next but I thought the scenes with Firth worked best.In the supporting roles, I would single out Edward Fox's cameo as Algy's long-suffering butler, Lane; wonderful and droll, and played spot on but then you never get anything less from Edward Fox.It is nothing like Anthony Asquith's 1952 version with Michael Redgrave as Jack, Michael Denison as Algernon, and Edith Evans as Lady Bracknell but what would be the point of doing just another remake of the original?I think Oliver Parker's interpretation was bold, imaginative and worthy of note.  Cecily's dreams of the Knight in shining armour, although in one way silly, was also clever and I am sure young ladies of Edwardian era (and especially Victorian era) may have fantasised like that!I think Oscar Wilde may have been amused by this interpretation of his play; after all, he did lead rather a decadent life.

I felt this counterbalanced the modernity of some characters behaviour, such as the tattoo scenes.I thought that the re-arrangement of the text and the additional scenes were justified.  If a new version of a film does not give a new reading of the original, then what would be the point of making it?

I needed to do so before I wrote this because I really didn't know what my true opinion was until the second viewing. The answer is now simple. It takes a while to adjust to the sedate pace of the whole thing, and seeing it twice obviously solves this problem. Having adjusted, it really is worth the effort. It would have been terribly easy to completely update the story and upbeat the pace but the producers have resisted, and it works so well with this lack of tampering. At first I was rather restless with the slow pace, but, like a good wine, it grows on you. I have nothing but the original film with which to compare it, but I feel that the depth of the cast is a match for the original actors. Judi Dench is magnificent, but I don't agree that the film improves when she's on screen. It's already good enough, thanks to the likes of the terrific Frances O'Connor, and the naturally beautiful Reese Witherspoon. The menfolk are OK, too, although I wish I didn't know that Rupert Everett was gay, especially when he's kissing Reese Witherspoon! Colin Firth has vaulted in status, having impressed in 'Bridget Jones' Diary', whereas here he is the character who holds the story together. It is his performance which dictates the ultimate success or failure of the film. Thankfully, it is a success. The smaller roles played by Tom Wilkinson, Anna Massey and Edward Fox are also integral to the overall success of the piece. There are very slow patches, during which some of the audience appeared to be flagging, but overall it is a triumph for British films. Having said that, we couldn't appear to find any English actresses to play the leads, but I'm complaining on that score. I've increasingly admired Frances O'Connor since 'AI'. She is versatile and will become even better, I feel. Reese Witherspoon, on the other hand, is already an 'A' list star, and it is nice to see her take on such a role (and the English accent, especially when she's from Nashville!). 7 out of 10.

Judi Dench says When I married Lord Bracknell, I had no fortune of any kind and we immediately see her as a music hall chorus girl - a masterly touch, as I always thought that aspect of the character was sadly missing in other performances of this part. Anna Massey gives a Miss Prism of miraculous complexity.  Watch the way she walks - arms spread out, bent a little to one side. Although I yearned for lovely Margaret Rutherford and Miles Malleson. Another surprise was the prominence of Algy's character - after all, the play is called The Importance of being EARNEST (or Ernest). And now we come to the biggest change of all - when Colin Firth looks up the list of generals to find out his real name, he doesn't say Christian names - Ernest John. as in the play. No, he says, I always knew my name was Ernest. And THEN - WE SEE A SHOT OF LADY BRACKNELL LOOKING AT THE NAME- AND IT IS JOHN. Not Ernest at all.

If you haven't read his play, on which this movie is based, then I totally recommend it. It's the funniest thing I've ever read, and that includes Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett.The plot revolves around two wealthy and decadent men in London around the turn of the century. Both lead secret lives Jack Worthing pretends to be his wild brother Earnest when in the city, so that he can live the good life and keep his good reputation, while Algernon Moncrieff has a conveniently sick friend called Bunbury, whom he 'visits' when he wants to escape into the country. Jack is in love with Algy's cousin Gwendolyn, but the marriage is opposed by her battleship of a mother, Lady Bracknell. Jack unfortunately was found in a bag left at a railway station, and Lady Bracknell refuses to establish an alliance with a man whose family heritage is a cloakroom. Things really begin to get complicated when Algy decides to woo Jack's ward Cecily, by pretending to be the infamous Earnest.Clever as it is, the plot is no more than the coathanger on which thewordplay and satire of social values are hung. The movie isn't the classic the play is, but it does do Wilde's brilliant script justice. Some great lines are cut out, but there are some good bits that are new, such as the scenes involving bills at The Savoy restaurant, which, unlike some film adaptions of famous literature, are seamlessly worked into the original story. The quality cast, including Colin Firth, Reese Witherspoon and Judi Dench, does a fine job of being seriously silly, though there were moments when I thought things got a little too serious. 'The Importance of Being Earnest' is a bit like a Monty Python movie in that way the more absurd it is the better. The movie's best scene, involving muffins and despair, is it's silliest.'Earnest' is all about frothy wit and rich British people with nothing better to do than stand around in gorgeous rooms making ridiculous statements. It has no more substance than a meringe, but it is just as fun to taste.7/10  "}{"Title":"Absolutely loved this movie, can't wait to see it again!","Date":"30 August 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  My friend and myself went out for a movie night.

The second was that I watched the film Another Country for the first time - and developed a crush on Rupert Everett of such embarrassing magnitude that I even sat through The Next Best Thing, years later. In addition, and almost despite myself, I began to think that Colin Firth was kinda hot too...So you can imagine my anticipation of the film that would bring together these foundational aspects of my fifteen-year-old self the nostalgia, the echoes of unbridled adolescent lust would make, I thought, for an evening of uninterrupted, self-indulgent joy.But alas! There they all were, Everett, Firth, Judi Dench, Frances O'Connor, even Oscar Wilde, in a way...and nothing happened.

The performances (and casting) were top-notch. Ever since An Ideal Husband, I've always thought of Rupert Everett as the classic Wildeian actor, and from my first reading of the play felt he'd be the perfect Algy. Colin Firth plays off him nicely, and the women just ooze charm. Judi Dench is...well...Judi Dench. Her being terrific is hardly worth reporting.It was also gorgeous to look at. Sets and exteriors were lush and vibrant; costumes were bright and appropiate. The camera was mobile in the best possible way, lending the whole film the sort of dynamism that is only possible in the cinema.I felt that the changes were entirely in the spirit of the play. Oscar would have loved it. He was fond of the cheeky, and the scandalous. It they had just filmed the play it wouldn't have worked. For one thing, it would have been too long, for another, too static. Part of the great thing about movies is that they aren't restricted to a specific setting. Cutting is part of adapting a play to the screen. They're different media, and you have to treat them differently.The added bits, I think, are really in fitting with the characters. Cecily having medieval-inspired romantic fantasies couldn't be more right, and Gwendolyn's getting a tattoo, though a little bit of a stretch, is believable. (She is the one who always travels with her diary, so she'll have something sensational to read on the train).And though they did change the ending, there's nothing in the play to imply that Jack wouldn't have lied about his real name. In fact, that's entirely the kind of thing he would do. The change showed great imagination, and made Wilde's satirical, too-pat ending a little easier too swallow.

I don't understand why it got such bad reviews; I'm not a big movie buff, and hadn't even heard of it until I wanted to go to the movies and we found it was the only thing playing at the time. Boy were we lucky! The movie was wonderfully acted, and it just seemed to flow. The comedy was wonderful, witty, and refreshingly clean. It was wonderful to go to the movies and find something so hilarious and completely free of sex and dirty humor. Everet was as wonderful as ever, and Witherspoon was her usual gifted self; she plays such a wonderful character, so dreamy and head-in-the-clouds and completely sure of herself and her life. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants a romantic comedy that will have you turning red in the face, trying not to laugh so you don't miss the next line. It's wonderful.

It was a coventional filming of the play mostly in the original drawing room and garden locales.  What made it fabulous was the acting, it's directorial simplicity and it's way with Wilde's uncanny language.Now Oliver Parker must be an Oscar Wilde fan.  This is his second movie adaptation (after his wonderful An Ideal Husband) so he must know and love the Asquith movie.  So he has been very wise, therefore, to completely avoid filming the play as a stage piece.  It's already been done better than he could possibly do. Instead, he's opened up the locations and given us a truly cinematic version of Wilde's comedy that takes advantage of what a movie can do and a play cannot; which is to transport you to innumerable places both real and fantastic.  He's also pushed the period to the opening decades of the 20th century by using model T cars and ragtime inspired music. Some of these ideas are inspired (like Cecily's Pre-Raphealite medieval fantasies) and those that aren't (Gwendolyn's getting a tatoo) don't spoil Wilde's barbs and fun.Parker, I'm sure, also insisted that his very fine cast not try to imitate the very masterful interpretations in the 1952 movie. They can't be duplicated (or bettered in my opinion). But what we get is some very fresh, interesting, new takes on these characters that bear no resemblance to the 1952 cast. In particular, Anna Massey, Tom Wilinson, and Judi Dench are quite wonderful; but so is the entire cast.Wilde's singular way with language is paramount and most of the incredible lines remain in the screenplay.  After listening to the witless dialogue in Spiderman and the new Star Wars epic, this movie makes you long for the good old days when great writers wrote great language.  Do yourself a favor and see this movie.  It will engage your mind and tickle your funny bone!

He's included things like daydream sequences, Dixieland Jazz, and a tattoo scene that aren't in the original, and the critics contend that Oscar Wilde must therefore be spinning in his grave.I liked all the modern additions. They made the movie more enjoyable and accessible than it would've been otherwise (I certainly liked it better than Mr. Parker's other foray into Wilde, An Ideal Husband).  Most drawing room plays written for the stage by stodgy 19th century playwrights (Wilde, Chekhov, Ibsen, etc.) are about as interesting as watching grass grow.  Mr. Parker was wise to liven things up a bit with some modernism.  Wilde's wit remains intact and the actors deliver their lines impeccably; the audience I saw this movie with did lots of laughing.It's also beautifully shot; the period costumes and grand country estates are wonderful to look at.And Reese Witherspoon does a great job at being English.If you like intelligent romantic comedies, The Importance of Being Earnest is worth seeing.

Great plays cannot be forever preserved in Amber, never to change, always mounted in the same ways and subject to the same old readings.  In this film the director has attempted to bring Wilde's wicked wit to a contemporary audience, many of whom have not been taught how to think.  Did he go too far at time? By all means.  I agree that even a free thinking Gwendolyn would never get a tattoo, particularly on her back side. Nor would Jack nee Earnest. Suggesting that Lady Bracknell had been plucked from the world of the music hall was totally wrong.  Most of the other changes served Wilde very well however.  Like Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde's writing can survive tinkering by the gifted as well as by hacks. This version is not the work of a hack.  Go for it!!

Before a screening of Fantasia, Disney handed Stravinsky a score to The Rite of Spring, used as the basis of the origin of life sequence in the movie. Stravinsky was confused; he knew the piece from memory. Why did he need a score? Ah, but what was in Fantasia had only a remote connection to the music he wrote. In short, The Importance of Being Earnest is that sort of movie loosely based on the original, cut, rearranged and entirely rethought. In the process of opening up Wilde's play for film and updating it for imagined 21st-century sensibilities, Parker has created backstories for characters, invented locations, inserted fantasy sequences, and changed the ending. Wilde is either spinning in his grave or having a good laugh in whichever segment of the afterlife he found himself in. Around basically good performances by the mostly English cast, Parker has attached a collection of hyperenergetic bits and bobs seemingly to improve upon Wilde's original. One must have expected something like this, but not to the degree to which it's been done. I mean, Gwendolyn getting a tattoo? That's rethinking the character taken to the Luhrmannesque extreme. I guess this is what young folks want these days, and who else goes to the movies? For the rest of us, my suggestion is to either wait for the DVD so you can fast forward through the extra bits or find the 1952 film, finally available on tape and DVD in the U.S.  "},{"Title":"Too thin","Date":"3 November 2008","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Given the rather impressively weighted Ideal Husband this is a disappointment - indeed it feels like an afterthought.

Witherspoon and O'Connor are sharp but not insubstantial. For all that Judy Dench is a sharp-tongued matriarch, she also has a twinkle in her eye.The problem is in the execution. It feels like an over-staged version as if it were some sort of musical, where the vim and sparkle that is a function of the script becomes it's content. The gay-NY sitcom Will & Grace is a fine modern example of how to strike this balance well (albeit over 25 mins).

But there are some scenes in the movie that we can't find in the book like the serenade of the two guys,Dr. Chasuble's marriage proposal etc..These scenes add some fun to the nature of the movie but the primary point of Wilde's play is to satirize the Victorian era morals. the movie seems like good romance comedy but it should be seem like a comedy of manners actually. It is not supposed to be a flighty coincidental love story I guess. But I gotta say I loved the costumes,decor and scenery in the movie. Though it's basically a play it's also a great idea to move to play out to some country area to shot the related acts!

"},{"Title":"What were they thinking?","Date":"3 January 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" The Importance of Being Earnest is one of the greatest English farces ever created. So, why did the director feel the need to change it so much. He made an adaptation a few years earlier of An Ideal Husband and it was very good. It stuck mostly to Wilde's play and the changes that were made were not major and fit in with the spirit of the play. In The Importance of Being Earnest, I think that the director might have been given too large a budget. He for some reason felt the compulsion to add things that served no purpose, ruined the flow of the play and messed up the characters. The cast itself of was decent. Rupert Everett was his usual charming self. Colin Firth was able to play Earnest well enough. Judi Dench has the air of the aristocracy that made her perfect for Lady Markby and Frances McDormand, although not that great, was decent enough, although I wish she would make everything so dramatic. The One unfortunate miscast in a lead was Reese Witherspoon, an actress I normally adore. You can tell that she is trying her hardest, but her English accent is atrocious and she looks out of place in many of the scenes. They should have picked an English actress to fill the role. The additions to the movie sometimes made you cringe like Algernon being chased around London and jumping in people's carriages to escape bill collectors or Gwendolyn tattooing Earnest on her butt or the ridiculous piano number that Algy and Earnest sing or Cecily's dream sequences about knights or the hot air balloon Algy arrives in the country in. Others are out of character, Earnest going to a Folie Bregie like dance club with Algy or the Reverend drawing pictures of Miss Prism in Greek garb. And still others that mess up the play like Lady Markby marrying Lord Markby while she was a pregnant dancer or Earnest's real name being Jack. Many parts of Wilde's scenes were also taken out. There is only about a third of the conversations between Cecily and Algy as well as half of the muffin scene, which is one of the best in the play. While I do not mind omissions in movies most of the time, they took them out to make room for useless and awful scenes not in the play, so I have to object. They should have left well enough alone. I'm not saying that the entire movie is bad there are some brief shining moments in it but they are few and far between. The actors themselves seem to realize how awful the script is and it seems that they are not really trying there hardest in it, with the possible exception of Reese Witherspoon, but as I already said her performance isn't anything to laud. There is one adorable scene at the end with a funeral for Algy's made up friend Bunbury, but its at the end and you would have to sit through the entire movie to see it.

Firth is more subtle, and his comic timing is beyond praise.  Everett may be leaning too heavily on his familiar delivery, but he's fine in his role. The two men together are a pair of comic, lyric loons, especially when trying to talk themselves out of an increasingly more impossible situation!I thought Reese Witherspoon was a bit cautious with her accent which made her less spontaneous than she might otherwise have been, but she too, was delightful.Dame Judy Densch is perfect as Lady Bracknell, especially when she intones the famous lines (which I am not quoting accurately) ...losing ONE parent is indeed sad, but losing BOTH parents is CARELESS!...This is an enjoyable summer film that is beautifully acted, photographed and costumed.  And, no one does more for a plain white shirt that Colin Firth!Enjoy!

The lines where there, the characters (mean old Victorian Lady Bracknell), with a little change in focus of Earnest and Algy instead of Lady Bracknell and her Victorian manners.Great cast, great production = very fun pleasing film, walking away with more than just an adaptation of the play. Excellent wardrobe design. Yet I feel somewhat bothered by the bookworms, theater fans, film fanatics who feel discouraged to view a written work of art in a different manner from the original work. Little people who nag and complain if things are not represented in the exact same way they are made. That is why it is called an adaptation which is not the same as representing the exact work.I read the Importance of Being Earnest and I've seen various films about it, yet this one has an entirely different focus than the others, much like the many Shakespearean films about the same play made with different visions of representing it in mind...I must say critics to review anything in life one must know about its history, its inner and outer workings and learn how to review a work of art not just on biased opinions if you liked it or not, but on review of the work, of the production and the written play.

I read some of the comments, the ones, who like this version and the ones, who do not appreciate it.No one has underlined that the strength of Oscar Wilde's wit is his brilliant, sharp and acute use of paradox, which my Random Dictionary defines as1/ a seemingly contradictory or absurd statement that expresses a possible truth; 2/ a self-contradictory and false proposition; 3/ a person, thing or situation exhibiting an apparently contradictory nature; 4/ an opinion or statement contrary to commonly accepted opinion. or in the case of Oscar Wilde all the 4 propositions very smartly intertwined in this play, his very best. Of course he uses paradox in his previous plays, but here in TIOBE he has achieved the top effects of all the 4 paradox possibilities at their best. And this is what makes this play so enjoyable not only at the time of Queen Victoria, but at any given time  mothers will always try to get the best possible match for their off-springs, and this was true in 1890 and in 1990 and in 2002..... Nothing has changed, except for the way we dress, speak, etc. And as one commentator wrote very sensibly, in this version we do not hear four-letter words, farts, burps, or see tits, and more buttocks, I must say that I have found this version of the play very true to the intention of the author, and no, Oscar Wilde would not turn in his grave, I am sure he would be very pleased and have a great time. I want to add that all the actors, including the two butlers Edward Fox and Patrick Godfrey, have done a terrific job, and I want to say that Dame Judi Dench has done tremendously with Lady Bracknell (which I thought she had not done so well with Lady De Bourg in the latest version of P&P), I may not like so much the additions of the Muses in the bushes, etc.., but this is a movie and not a PLAY on a stage. A play may lend itself to interpretations and some changes, since there are no clear-cut limits imposed by the author. Regarding P&P, for instance, the author has written in the NOVEL exactly all he or she, she in this example, wants to see and all she needs to bring her ideas to the mind of the readers, this is why I tend to be very demanding of the directors to respect the text of the authors  they cannot do what they jolly well please !!! Please go and enjoy !

There have been several screen versions of it and this stands out as one of the most famous.Firstly, there is a terrific cast. Colin Firth seems a natural choice for Jack and he embodies him greatly, grasping the stubborness and slight madness of the character (something i thoroughly enjoyed doing on stage as i have played him too). Rupert Everett steals the show as Algernon, bringing the absurdity of the character and Oscar wilde would have been proud of him. Judi Dench is clearly the best choice for Lady Bracknell and wisely chose to create her own version of the character and not imitate the great Dame Edith Evans. Frances O'connor is a good Gwendolen, except she lacks the obnoxiousness that is required. Reese Witherspoon is brilliant as Cecily, despite the fact that i don't think she quite understands some of the lines. Tom Wilkinson, Anna Massey are perfect in their roles as Dr Chasuble and Miss Prism and Edward Fox can claim to be the most hilarious Lane in history.However, despite the brilliant cast, one is better off sticking with the 1952 version. This version for some odd reason seems to have changed the original script and i will never understand why we were constantly seeing Cecily's fantasies. Anyone who thinks that they can write better than Wilde are sadly mistaken. Micheal Redgrave was a much better Jack than Colin Firth and nobody can come close to Edith Evans as Lady Bracknell. This 2002 version can claim the best algernon, dr chasuble and lane, but not much else. The only other one who comes close to matching the old one is Reese Witherspoon, playing a very similar Cecily to Dorothy Tutin. Also, Joan Greewood's plummy voiced Gwendolen completely overshadowes Frances O'connor's. And noyone could ever forget Maragaret Rutherford's scene stealing Miss Prism.However, I do recommend this new version for Wilde fans, as second viewing to the old one.Many thanks, Derek "},{"Title":"I thought it was perfect.","Date":"22 June 2005","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Our school did The Importance of Being Earnest for our fall play and I was Cecily Cardew.

I was EXCEEDINGLY happy when they sang 'Lady Come Down', an original poem by Oscar Wilde. I did like the few changes they made from what our script was- for instance, Algernon wasn't really having money troubles- and if he was I don't remember them. I liked that the movie kept the same script but changed the scenery a little, as many Americans have difficultly paying attention when there aren't changes in the background (watch 'No Exit'. I played Inez and half hour into the play nobody understood what was going on as it's all one scene.) I saw BBC also do this, and it was funny- but I like this version better.

Virtually ever one of the talented cast members is criminally misused, with the possible sole exception of Anna Massey as Miss Prism (though she could hardly be more different from the wonderful Margaret Rutherford in the same role in the 1952 production).In sum, had Oscar Wilde's play been this badly presented when it was first mounted, it would have been justifiably booed off the stage.

In adapting the play to the screen, Parker has managed to unshackle the work from its stage confines, allowing the action to occur in many different locales, often out of doors.  This expansion of the play's geography gives the plot a certain looseness and forward momentum that nicely complements the lightning-paced nature of Wilde's original dialogue.The theme of the play is, of course, reflected in the name of the work itself, which, in true Wilde fashion, utilizes a clever play on words to make its point.  The `earnest' of the title serves a double function, referring to both the importance of honesty, truthfulness and frankness in human relations and to the fact that two men are displaying anything but those virtues when they commandeer the name Ernest as a pseudonym to advance their own selfish causes.  It is Algy and Jack, the two main characters of the piece, who learn that there is a high price to be paid for dishonesty and deception, for those two vices routinely lead to the kinds of interpersonal complications and misunderstandings from which it is often hard to extricate oneself.  Wilde has fashioned a clever, ingeniously structured plot that employs wit, romance, and gentle social satire to make his point painlessly and effectively.The wonderful cast, which includes Rupert Everett, Colin Firth, Reese Witherspoon, Judi Dench, Frances O'Connor, Anna Massey and Edward Fox, does a superb job hitting just the right note in conveying the lighthearted wit of the text.  Moreover, the film has been sumptuously shot on location in England and boasts exquisite costumes and set design that beautifully reflect the 19th Century period in which the story is set.`The Importance of Being Earnest' provides both a pleasant diversion for the Wilde aficionado and a fine introduction for those unfamiliar with the author and his works.  Mr. Parker is now batting three for three in his moviemaking career and I eagerly await his next endeavor.

"}{"Title":"Light comedy with attractive characters.","Date":"6 July 2002","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  The entire cast is a standout in 'The Importance of Being Earnest'.  In particular Judi Dench and Colin Firth.  Firth and Rupert Everett fall in love with the same woman (Reese Witherspoon).  Judy Dench is Lady Bracknell, a woman concerned about the social background of any man who wants the hand in marriage of any young lady in her family.  Her approval is pivotal in the making of a happy relationship.  Director Oliver Parker made 'An Ideal Husband' in 1999 and duplicates his light but effective look here that seems a lot like English theatre but in his motion pictures, he keeps a clean and effective dignity intact that some still seek but sometimes have a hard time finding.
