I grew up in Oregon, attended U of O (the setting for much of the movie), and witnessed some of the events portrayed. So it was with a surge of satisfaction that I watched this movie that got it right at each point along the way. The attention to detail was astounding, and the recreation of races was uncanny - I compared it to actual news photos later, and the actors playing competing runners were chosen so well that their bodies and running styles actually match the original men.  When a movie cares this much about being faithful to details, you can be sure it will take a quality approach overall. Billy Crudup's portrayal of Pre is full of inner fire and consistent with the real man; Donald Sutherland is marvelously powerful and yet understated as Bill Bowerman; the examination of the real reasons athletes compete is thorough and moving. Innovative use of music and camera work brings the race scenes to life, and if this movie doesn't make you want to immediately go out for a quick ten, you're a completely hopeless sedentarian-- in heart and body. This is among the five finest movies about athletics ever made.

And Sutherland gives the performance of his career as Bill Bowerman.  I truly hope it lands him an Oscar nomination.

He was talented,  cocky and had so much charisma. He really was outspoken in the press and took no guff from the AAU. He  was the best thing that ever happened to track. Seeing the movie was like deja vu. It was a really well done recreation of what it was like to be at Hayward Field during his races.

Where as the other Prefontaine bio-pic &#145;Prefontaine' provided an honest, technical look at Pre's life and the sport of running, `Without Limits' is more of a lyrical homage to the sport, the man, the zen of it all.The performances seamlessly intermesh with the story-Donald Sutherland is good, as Coach Bill Bowerman, but Sutherland is always good..and I believe his performance here has gotten more recognition as a result of  the way Towne has organized his version-the Bowerman role is centerpiece, in contrast to the more downplayed, subtler roles of the other principals.Let Robert Towne do whatever he wants,  I will come and watch.

So when I realized that the main character really ran like the wind and had no physical obstacles he couldn't overcome I instantly became an admirer of Steve Prefontaine.Billy Crudup, who truly stole every scene even in Almost Famous is brilliant as Steve Prefontaine. His amazing transformation into the role of America's fastest runner was absolutely amazing, and I had no idea who the actor was, I only vaguely remembered his name. Donald Sutherland delivers his performance of the decade and the very beautiful Monica Potter does a great job as well.The subtle manner in which the director chose to display Pre's life is admirable and very touching. He truly was a role model. He's a role model to me now, more than 30 years later. When he was explaining his running logic to his coach I really understood his look on life. He wasn't planning on being disappointed, he went the distance.There's one more thing this movie deserves immense credit for. It made me want to run. AND ACTUALLY ENJOY IT!!!!!!!

This film dramatized the life of Steve Prefontaine, a pre-eminent U.S. distance runner in the 1970's.Though some of the details of his life were fudged for dramatic purposes, the essence of Prefontaine was preserved, namely his brash egotistical style of running and living.  In addition to its realism regarding the sequences filmed on the track, this film gives a good account of the psychology of running.  Robert Towne did a fabulous job overall with this film, but especially with the realism of the scenes on the track.  The dramatic element, focusing on character development of Prefontaine as a person as well as a runner was also well done, elevating it above your typical sports documentary and improving its entertainment value.Billy Crudup gives a fine performance as Pre.  He captures the arrogance and the crushing disappointment of his life.  He was also terrific in the running scenes. Donald Sutherland was also great as Coach Bill Bowerman.  Sutherland played the part with the perfect balance of patient guidance and frustration as Pre continued to ignore his prudent advice.  It was as if he were trying to guide a lightning bolt.This was an excellent sports story.  I rated it an 8/10.  Even for those who are not fans of track and field and never heard of Steve Prefontaine, this is an entertaining and absorbing film.

The story is well told with great performances and a superb soundtrack, the greatest treat of all being Donald Sutherland's fantastic performance as Bill Bowerman. This bit of acting makes me wonder how once again Sutherland could be forgotten by the Oscars. With a career including such great roles as in M*A*S*H, Klute and Ordinary People, the fact that he is still cheated of even a nomination bewilders me, especially when this film came in a year where the only true competition for such a performance was Geoffrey Rush's scene stealing work in Elizabeth.

The photography was stunning. It was filmed on location in Eugene Oregon. Tom Cruise Produced the picture and his choice for director was key. Robert Towne Directed and co- wrote the screenplay.Most people think of Mr. Towne as a writer. His movies include the screen play for Mission Impossible and the Classic, China Town. China Town brought him both the Oscar and the Golden Globe for best Original Screenplay. He has directed very few films over the years but the fit for this project was on the mark.Steve Prefontaine was a larger then life figure. To tell his story right Robert really had to do his home work. He chose to film the actual locations surrounding Prefontaines life. This really gave it a realistic feel. To see the actual track where Steve broke almost every long distance record on the books. The track where he was never defeated. That had a lot of meaning. Just a side note This track today, is the site of the Pre- Classic. It's one of the worlds biggest track events of the year. The worlds top track and field star's take part in this event.I had the good fortune to play an extra in this film. I owned a 1965 Pontiac. Warner Brothers was scouting out some car shows and asked if they could use my car in the movie. ( you can see it in the outside scene in front of the bar called, The Pad). Later I was asked If i would like to appear as an extra. Of course i said yes. After a long shoot the director, Robert Town came over and asked me to go to makeup. He had a scene for me. I was to appear with Billy Crubup, who played Steve Prefontaine and Monica Potter who played Mary Marchx his girl friend. Although the scene was cut from the movie, i got to meet some wonderful people. I had breakfast with Billy who turned out to be a warm person and later met Monica who seemed to be lonely during the long down times between takes.As i was moving my Pontiac on the set, Donald Sutherland who was going over his script for an upcoming scene, came over to me and told me how much he like my car. I showed him around and he seemed interested. He was really a great guy.I bring all this up to point out that a lot of wonderful people who took pride in their craft came together and put out a wonderful picture.

This film places the majority of its' attention solely on the relationship between Pre (Crudup) and his coach in college and the Olympics, Bill Bowerman (Donald Sutherland).  Like Crudup, Sutherland is near perfect here and should rank as one of his best performances.  The monologue that Sutherland gives after showing television news footage of the infamous massacre that tarnished the Summer games in Munich is just...flawless.  Monica Potter is fine here as the girl who Prefontaine had the most interest in.  Look for director William Friedkin appears early in the movie in a small role.  The film's director/co-writer, Robert Towne is wise in how to handle the drama and tension here and shows what a genius he is.  Now that I look back at the film, I wonder if there'll be another great distance runner to come from the U.S..  The answer might come in Alan Webb?  I don't know.

It's a biopic of one of the greatest wasted talents of the American track athletic history Steve Prefontaine. Prefontaine nearly won a medal at the 1972 Olympics but was edged out at the last lap and came in fourth instead. It is a movie about promise, disappointment and ultimately loss and tragedy.Billy Crudup plays Prefontaine very convincingly, so much so that you forget you are watching an actor and not the man himself. This was made in the time when Crudup was just establishing himself as a new force and new star in Hollywood and this role certainly helped him establish himself as that. He is an exciting talent and very capable in expressing the emotions this part requires. Donald Sutherland of course plays his coach and the inventor of Nike shoes, Bill Bowerman. He also gives a great portrayal of the man who was the main mentor and trainer of Prefontaine, almost like a second father to him. Monica Potter plays Prefontaine's love interest and adds a love angle to the film, which makes it complete and more enjoyable to watch.The beginning and the first half of this film is the most enjoyable part and also contains some humorous scenes, such as the one where Sutherland exposes one of Pre's college stable mates as well endowed, to the man's embarrassment. Also, we see the rise of Steve's career on national level, which culminates in the race where he beats the legendary Frank Shorter. However, the triumph doesn't last as he takes part in the Munich Olympics and makes a great race, only to run out of gas in the last lap and get overtaken by three men. There is a brief scene afterwards where the winner, Finland's Lasse Viren, gives a brief look of sympathy and acknowledgment to the disappointed Prefontaine and this scene is one of the dramatic high points of the film. It expresses the feeling of competing at this level and how it is to lose and win sometimes the line is very thin between winners and losers. The direction is great and kudos to the director Robert Towne for doing such a great job on what was his only third directing job. He is otherwise known mostly as a screenwriter but this movie proved he definitely had something to offer as a director to. In the end, one can only think about how the 1976 Olympics and the history of long distance running would look had Steve not driven so fast that night.

Is it semantics, like religious and spiritual? Maybe there isn't one. On the other hand, some would say there's all the difference in the world.Steve Prefontaine (played by Billy Crudup), was a distance runner in Eugene, Oregon with scholarship offers from Yale, Brown, Villanova, Princeton and Nebraska. The one school he wishes to attend, however, has remained silent. Two distance runners from the school and its assistant coach make a personal visit to his home but Prefontaine (Crudup) is not impressed. In the less-than-three week period between that visit and the date when he must sign his letter of intent, Bill Bowerman, head coach of the University of Oregon track team, sends a genuine plea to young Prefontaine asking him to attend. On his first day, he shows an amazing inability to notice the obvious by asking a female student, Mary Marckx (played by Monica Potter) to direct him to an area that is clearly visible ahead of him. He enters the building and sees a long line of fellow team members who recount tall tales of Bowerman's exploits in the military. He is summoned from another room and, on the floor in front of him, he finds his head coach. Bowerman (played and earlier voiced by Donald Sutherland) is making outlines of his runners' feet on tracing paper for the purposes of making shoes specifically for them, explaining that taking an ounce off a runner's shoe amounts to pounds they won't have to carry during a race. The freshman athlete sarcastically compliments him and that is the end of their first interaction. The next day, during a simple workout, Steve gives one hundred percent, finishes ahead of his teammates, and, according to Bowerman, with a pulse rate north of one hundred and ninety. So begins the struggle that would define their relationship a coach's desire to instruct and an athlete's desire to put forth his best effort, regardless of the consequences.Much has been made of the fact that Without Limits and Prefontaine, a Disney film covering the same subject matter from a different perspective, were released within months of each other. The general consensus seems to be that, while Prefontaine is more accurate, Without Limits is the better film. As I have not seen the former from beginning to end, all I can tell you is that Without Limits is a masterpiece. Sutherland is mesmerizing as Bill Bowerman and Crudup, in the first role I ever saw him play, is just as entertaining, if not more so. The conflict between them rings true and while you understand the position of the coach, you root for the runner who seeks to leave the field knowing he's done his best. I have seen this film many times and, if you haven't even seen it once, you should. Now.

Nothing you encounter then seems as awful or impossible. But most people live their lives as though they believe they're going to live forever. Pre must have had a premonition of his early demise as he lived every day as though it were his last. He refused to pace himself as his wise coach Bill Bowerman attempted to advise him and as all us mere mortals must do if we hope to make the finish line. Though Pre was not limited by conventional concerns or constraints as an athlete, he did have definite obstacles to overcome as a person. These seemingly negligible human concerns can sometimes trip up and cripple even the most gifted athletes, and Pre is almost undone by his own negligent hubris. But, as if on a divine mission, he heroically persisted in his own unique quest for excellence, for immortality.Thanks in no small part to this fine film, Pre may in fact succeed at his lofty goal of immortality, as anyone who has had the good fortune to experience Without Limits will never forget it. While it excels as a fairly accurate portrait of a truly remarkable individual, it absolutely soars as a tribute to that indomitable spirit that moves men to greatness. Robert Towne has captured the essence of the mystery of our competitive natures, of how it's more than just about winning, or being the best, or being known for it. There's still something else undefinable that drives athletes, that eludes description, just beyond the grasp, but of which we all somehow have intimate knowledge. This is Without Limits' most admirable attribute; it's subtle and graceful exploration of the human soul. People oblivious to this aspect of Towne's creation will likely find the film to be only average or even dull. That's their loss.Billy Crudup inhabits the role of Steve Prefontaine so effortlessly, and is so physically similar that it's still jarring for me to see actual footage of Pre; the two are indiscernible. Donald Southerland as the curiously mannered coach is a delight, so relaxed yet commanding. Monica Potter is very attractive and alluring as Steve's main squeeze. That Pre would die at 24 in a car crash is almost fitting for someone who lived life so fully, so intensely. But he wasn't reckless, he wasn't self destructive, and that's why his death is all that more tragic. There are so many people that had it all and threw it away out of pride, ignorance, fear, or weakness, but Pre seemed to have conquered his demons and was well on the right track to a life of genuine meaning and joy when he was suddenly cut down in his prime. It's a tragedy of epic proportions, the stuff of legends.

Without Limits is a good example. It tells the true-life story of Oregon long-distance runner Steve Prefontaine (Billy Crudup), known as Pre, headed for the Olympics in the early 1970s.Pre was not built to be a runner; he was too small. But determination and sheer guts helped overcome some of his physical limitations. When his girlfriend asks him how he can beat guys with more talent, he responds A little secret I learned a long time ago ... I can endure more pain than anyone you've ever met.But he and his college coach, legendary Bill Bowerman (Donald Sutherland) were constantly fighting. Bowerman explains their relationship From the beginning I tried to change him. And from the beginning, he tried not to change. That was our relationship, and even that never changed. Late in the film, after some disappointments, Bill and Pre continue their verbal battle. Pre Okay, so what's my problem Bill? Bill Vanity. Pre Vanity? Bill Your insistence that you have no talent is the ultimate vanity; if you have no talent, you have no limits; it's all an act of will.Without Limits is mostly a character study of a remarkable young man. Pre comes across as brash, contentious, charismatic, cocky, and something of a prima donna; he also comes across as idealistic, single-minded, determined, relentless, self-assured, a risk-taker who is unafraid.The script contains some fine dialogue. And the plot builds in intensity as we approach the 1972 Summer Olympics. After that competition, there's something of a lull. But given the fatalistic nature of the story, the plot turns riveting toward the end.Color cinematography is competent. There are lots of close-up shots, and some slow-motion shots during various races. Pop songs from the early 1970s, along with era hair styles and clothes help put the story in its proper historical context. Acting is credible. Donald Sutherland has never been better.This is the second of two films about Steve Prefontaine. The other is the Steve James directed film Prefontaine (1997). Both films are excellent. These films are not just for runners or for people who like bios. They're for people who can appreciate the significance of an ordinary guy who really lived, a guy who, in his chosen field, inspired others. That's what makes these two films worth watching.

And Donald Sutherland is quietly powerful as Bill Bowerman, the coach who's always got the right idea and motivation to help his star get the edge on fellow racers. (The script was co-written by Kenny Moore, portrayed by Billy Burke.) The most poignant scenes of this flame thrower of a man involve him pushing the boundaries one assumes mortals can't surpass. Steve literally runs till he bleeds! And perhaps most amazingly, slowed when in the trap of human gridlock and not fully able to go to the limit, Steve still placed fourth in the 1972 Munich Olympic's 5k race (clocking his last of three miles in that particular metric event at an astonishing 404 minutes). He died before being able to get another crack at the world's televised stage in Montreal for the 1976 summer games. One can only guess at the future this unique talent still had ahead. In a striking comparison, one could say Steve was to track what Bobby Orr was to hockey or Willie Mays to baseball. Or, Robert Towne to storytelling. "},{"Title":"Without Limits Review","Date":"20 November 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Sport","Review":" Without Limits is an inspirational film based on the greatest runner that America has ever seen and the tragedy that ended his life, Steve Prefontaine. Billy Crudup, looking very similar to the late Pre, plays the role. The film takes a look into the personality of the swift footed Oregon native. It starts out with Bill Dellinger trying to recruit Pre. This is when you see the first signs of his sarcastic side taking two of Oregon's best track runners on an easy ten leading them all the way. You also get a glimpse of Pre's stubborn side as well telling Oregon's recruiter that he would not go to Oregon unless head coach Bill Bowerman (who didn't believe in recruiting) personally let him know that he is wanted. Pre got his greetings in a letter and headed to the running college of Oregon. Pre's first couple of weeks on the Oregon track team got him the nickname that lasted to his dying days, Rube, as a cause of his drive to push the limits. Pre's first collegiate race was a blowout that shot him to stardom, smashing the American record. After that he was the all-star of Oregon's track team. Although Pre was a performer Bowerman insisted on pushing the limits on Pre's mental side, trying to cure him of front running which in Pre's eyes was chicken sh*t. Racing was a work of art to Pre and he wouldn't sit back for 2.5 miles and then take the race in the last 500 meters. The movie focuses on this battle between front running and the way Bowerman wanted him to race (holding back). This was the biggest struggle for Pre in his collegiate career, trying to test the odds and push the limits when everyone thought they were impossible. He wanted to go all out until he had nothing left. In the 1972 Munich Olympics is where Pre would come to a devastating halt in success. With high hopes in the preliminaries Pre told reporters, when they asked how he thought the race would turn out he stuck to his normal routine in saying I hope that it comes down to a pure guts race, if so then I am the only one who can win it. He also said at about the same time a phrase that is famous even still today If you're going to beat you will have to bleed to do it. Pre got beat in the race for gold and from there he went into a state of depression. The movie is not just some statistic, though, it has the romance that diverges the movie to a more emotional side. Mary was the soft spoken religious type that went on with her normal self until she was spotted by Pre. Love that Pre had never felt before was driven to be with Mary. Although at first Mary wasn't interested Pre's sarcastic, outspoken, and completely goal driven attitude grabbed her and pulled her in. Pre's relentless and persistence really shows in his pursuit of love. His ability to think he could do anything he wanted confused most because he refused to believe in talent. Pre's legacy went to a crashing end as the movie closes out its story. A powerful ending that leaves a lasting impression of the 24 year old track runner that was troubled with the fact that a mediocre effort could win a race and a magnificent effort could lose one. Pre broke every American record from 2,000 meters to 10,000. Director Robert Townes does a great job depicting the struggle, with help from a friend of Pre's, Kenny Moore also a world-class runner, the dynamic duo comes together to make a classic sports movie that anyone can relate too.

I always knew who Prefontaine was because I ran track and cross country in high school in the late 1970's and remember hearing of his untimely death. The film is done in a very straight forward kind of way and that's why I like it. It doesnt waste too much time with side stories or sub plots. One HAS to have a love story and many of the elements of the romance are some of the weakest moments but what can one do? You have to take SOME of the studios notes (besides - even though I think the actress playing the lead is beautiful, I have seen her in other films and I find her work very one-dimensional).

Do yourself a favor; order some pizza, sit down with some friends, turn out the lights and let Without Limits take you on a journey!

The only problem I had was that both PREFONTAINE and WITHOUT LIMITS failed to tell the whole story of Pre's death. They both show that in his fatal car crash, he was not to blame. This has never been proven, and is very doubtful considering that Pre's blood alcohol level was well over the legal limit.

It's too bad this movie wasn't  given a chance to find an audience with its short run at the  theatres, but now one can see the movie at home.  Without Limits is a better movie than Pre mainly because of its  actors. Billy Crudup's acting, appearance and running in Without  Limits are much more believable than Jared Leto's teen idol  cipher in Pre. Donald Sutherland plays Bill Bowerman in Without Limits as a Zen master who carefully uses his will and commands  on Pre. He is the coach's coach who meets the challenge of his  life with Prefontaine. R. Lee Ermey as Bowerman in Pre has a  diction and appearance which reminds me too much of a drill  sergeant instead of a coach. One thing I can't stand about both  movies are the actors cast to play Bill Dellinger who won the  bronze in the 5000 meter. As much as I love Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill  plays Dellinger in Pre), the two actors who play Dellinger in Pre and Without Limits look and talk more like football coaches  than a world-class runner who became a coach.  The psychology of Prefontaine and his wins and losses is  explained very well. Without Limits does a very smooth job in  mixing archival footage with scenes from the film. It's a  bittersweet experience watching the film knowing that the story  must end with Prefontaine's tragic death at 24. But that's the  material of which legend and Nike ads are made of.

Steve was only 24 at the time and was in the process of making a comeback in the forthcoming 1976 Montreal Olympics to both face and defeat the Flying Finn Lasse Viren, Pat Porter,in rematch of their sensational race in the Munich Olympics back in the summer of 1972. It was Viren who defeated Steve back in 1972 in the terror filled Munich Olympics where 11 Israeli athletes were murdered by their Arab kidnappers.In the film Without Limits we get to see how Steve pushed himself to the absolute limits in order to win. Like he told his girlfriend Oragon University coed Mary Marckx, Monica Potter, the reason that that I win is not that I'm the best runner in the race but the one who's willing to take the most pain in order to win it! And pain Steve took to the point of almost crippling himself, with a torn muscle, in order to win one of the many races that he competed in. Brash and sure of himself Steve found his coach of the Oragon University track & field team Bill Bowerman, Donalnd Southerland, detrimental to him in Bowerman wanting to change his unorthodox style of running. Bowerman wanting Steve to pace himself instead of burning himself out had to finally convince Steve to change his take the lead running style in the unforgettable 5,000 meter race at Munich. Holding back for the first two miles Steve finally exploded taking command with a mile left in the race. But with Steve's top competitor in the race Viren having enough left in not having to overextend himself against Steve, who was in the middle of the pack, for the first two miles he managed to pull out a victory and Olympic Gold Medal by passing and beating Steve in the last 200 meters of the race.Washed up at age 21 with no intentions to continue his running career Steve went into a deep depression until both Mary and Bill Bowerman finally talked him into getting back on the race track and train for the 1976 summer Olympics in Montreal. As things were to turn out Steve never lived to participate much less win in them!Great film about a truly great athlete Steve Defontaine who more then anyone else represented the Olympic spirit of selfless and honest competition among top athletes of the world's community of nations. Never looking for fame or fortune Steve only wanted to prove to himself and those who watched him preform-as well as participated against him-on the track that he was by far the best there was and ever will be in the field of middle to long distance running. The most fitting tribute for Steve was given at his memorial service by his tearful coach Bill Bowerman who finally, at the Munich Olympics which Steve lost, realized what a unique person as well as athlete Steve really was What Steve thought me is that the real purpose of winning a race isn't winning. It'as to test the limits of the human heart. And that he did. Nobody did it more often and nobody did it better.

This is a great story, whichever point of view you take. Steve Prefontaine, from Coos Bay, Oregon, was the preeminent middle distance runner for US Track, but moreover his driving competitive nature defined a changing spirit in US athletes. For years amateur athletes in America were bound by organizations like the AAU. Completely beholden to this type of organization athletes competed where they were told, acted the way they were told, and all in fear of losing their amateur status.Prefontaine was not only a rebel on the track, which the movie does a good job illustrating, but off the track as well. The movie does not attempt to make Pre out to be any hero, in fact the movie shows the rather selfish-self absorbed nature this guy had. It does show him from all sides...the fierce competitor, the non conformist, the rebellious nature of someone that abhorred the hypocrisy of the AAU, and the tender young man that was willing to fore-go what he could have on a silver platter to pursue a deeper relationship with a young Christian woman.The ending, as in life, is a tragic one. At only 24 he dies in a car accident. But he left behind a spirit that many kids growing up in the 70's felt. Today we take a company like NIKE for granted. In many ways Bill Bowerman's love of Pre forced him forward to perfect new running footwear and Pre's spirit still exists today in Beaverton, Or. almost 30 yrs. after his death.This is a fun and poignant movie and worthwhile investing 2 hours of TV time.

This quote is an important line to me in this movie. It applies to everyone in it, especially Prefontaine, and to everyone watching it.

(Bowerman is better known as the guy who started Nike using his wife's waffle iron to shape the tread of the home-made running shoes he insisted be worn by all the runners he coached.)  Without Limits follows Pre from his high school senior year, when he was being courted with offers of scholarships from universities around the country but wanted only one thing -- to be invited personally by Bowerman to work with him at the University of Oregon -- to his untimely death before the Montreal Olympics.  If the conventional rules of behaviour or methods of training didn't make sense to Pre he simply ignored them.  Naturally this led to conflict with his family, his coach and the American Track and Field Association. Naturally, as well, Pre's extraordinary ability earned him some latitude to pursue his unconventional methods.

For anyone who has ever run competitively, even only at the high school level like myself, this movie brings it all together.  Sitting in the audience with my cross-country teammates, I really felt like we knew what was going on.  Without Limits inspires you to want to go and just run all out for as long as you can, just as Pre ran all of his races.  It focuses on the personal side of Steve Prefontaine more than the earlier film did, and that focus provides more insight into who he was and why he did what he did. An inspirational and entertaining movie, it is a shame that it didn't get more exposure.  I'm looking forward to the video release.

Could any real person be as blithely assured and self-possessed as Pre's depicted by Billy Crudup and Robert Towne? I liked it a lot, but it's a long way from Towne's super-cynical 70s sensibility (The Last Detail, Chinatown, Shampoo) - not a criticism, just an observation. Have heard rumblings from critical press and others that Towne's finally caught the 90s Just think positive and it'll all be O.K. bandwagon. Gorgeous to look at - if only life looked like a Conrad Hall-shot film. Interesting how in the '72 Olympic race sequence they intercut Crudup with footage of Pre running the real-life race.

I really wanted to explain to people why running is so wonderful and enjoyable, and this movie is the perfect opportunity to show people what running is all about.  It left us really inspired and pumped up to run our races the next day at Junior Olympics.  One friend of mine was All-American.  It still inspires me to run everyday and enjoy the awesome feeling of running.

However, this is a very well directed and well acted film that would normally have fans all over it but they stayed away because of the track and field.  I think that track is the best thing to watch because you witness people push themselves to the limits like Pre. as he said running any other way would be chicken-s**t "},{"Title":"Individual efforts save over-the-top asceticism message","Date":"22 February 1999","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Sport","Review":" Without Limits (Warner Bros., Tom Cruise ex prod) compares favorably to the previous mainstream Hollywood biopic about Steven Prefontaine which is titled Prefontaine (Disney). It completes the triad on Prefontaine when you count the documentary Fire on the Track. Jared Leto played Prefontaine in the earlier film with an air of aloofness that sometimes comes across as odd in the film, even if it is faithful to moments of Prefontaine's personality. In Without Limits, Bill Crudup adds a bit more emotional depth.Pre's head coach at the University of Oregon, Bill Bowerman, is given a stately persona of detached authority by Donald Sutherland (nominated for a best supporting actor Golden Globe). The film uses fantastic running imagery and Crudup bears an eerie resemblance to Pre himself.While perhaps no true justice can be done to the life of Pre in under two hours of film time, Without Limits does a fairly good job. A few criticisms though. 1) The film really hammers a physical/spiritual asceticism message. 2) His girlfriend Mary's conservative Roman-Catholic-informed sexual abstinence feels placed a little cheaply in the film--hitting the viewer with guilt without warning. 3) It doesn't have Pat Tyson, Pre's roommate at Oregon. 4) While the film seeks a somewhat comprehensive view of Pre the man, it seems to forget that his life was short and therefore would have done well to focus a bit more on Pre the boy. 5) The film depicts Pre cutting his foot during an amorous escapade in a hotel room, when he really did on an exposed bolt at a swimming pool. 6)The film fails to show his last race. "},{"Title":"A film for fans of Pre, or of running.","Date":"31 December 1999","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Sport","Review":"  Unless you are a fan of running star Prefontaine, or have an abiding interest in the sport of running, or come from Oregon, this film has little appeal. The central character is unpleasantly arrogant without the saving grace of having achieved the greatness he strived for, an Olympic gold medal.The film does engage your interest in places. The races are very well done, in particular the mixing of slow with normal motion.Donald Sutherland plays, for once, a seemingly normal person. For a coach he appears to be very distant from the person being coached, to the extent of being a 'non-coach'.Viewed from the point of view of a dramatic work rather than as a biography, the film is overly long at 114 minutes (on video) and the pacing is uneven. Ultimately, a flawed film about a flawed person, but there are much worse films than this on current release.

My girlfriend, two friends, and I all showed up and were cast as extras. We befriended a director and spoke with him during the most part of the filming. Our big scene was the one at the old field at U of O, where the crowd chanted Pre! Pre! I had a cameo that was discarded when they saw an errant hairstitch... I remember seeing Donald Sutherland walking around looking very bored, and that many of us kept the superfly 70s footwear we were issued for the shoot...(i was already wearing Sambas and my own shoes were acceptable, malheueusement) Damn hippies! But what sweet golden days there in midlate 90s Eugene- as I recall we shot this in summer of '96...Long live IMDb!

I guess the entire 1700 people that actually like it posted, and the entire rest of the world felt it wasn't important enough o rate it at all.There is nothing wrong with the acting, directing, nor cinematography. The problem is, simply, that there's virtually no story. Prefontain's life didn't really contain much drama. Some guy is a good runner. He wins a bunch of races. The end. The writer threw in a mildly diverting love story to try to pad it out, but it doesn't help at all.I was a college runner at the time this movie takes place. Prefontain was a hero to us. I STILL find this movie painfully boring. Cant' give it a worse rating than that.Avoid this one like the plague.

Donald Sutherland is excellent as his coach.  The rest of the cast is good.  But, the movie has a fundamental flaw Steve Prefontaine is simply not interesting enough to have an entire film devoted to his story.  It also makes one wonder about the inbred racism in the Hollywod system that with all the African American track stars out there who have interesting lives (Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Florence Griffith-Joyner, Lee Elder, Edwin Mozes, etc...), the ONE with the movie is white.
