[{"Title":"Did you not SEE it?","Date":"23 April 2001","Score":"60 out of 66 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  When The Story of Us opened in 1999, the critical disdain was so overwhelming, that my fiancee and I opted not to see it.  After all, the ads focussed on its romantic comedy aspects, directed by Rob Reiner (When Harry Met Sally), and starred Bruce Willis (who had just undergone a public divorce).In retrospect, it's easy to assume why it got panned... this is NOT a romantic comedy, although there are comedic elements.  Those expecting a Harry/Sally II would be clearly be disappointed.  Those expecting some insight to Bruce Willis' marriage, too, would be disappointed.  The film is neither of those things.Of course, had the associations not existed, and the ad campaign refocussed its efforts, the film would be far better respected.  That's why time will be very kind to this film.Not everything works. Some scenes, like the language of the women, are too profanity-laced to sound like real women (making David Mamet's writing seem like Jane Austen by comparison).  There's a terrible scene with Willis in a restaurant--unrealistic, unfunny.Why then recommend the film?  Because the agony, the depth of painful emotions, are real.  Find a better acting job by Willis or Pfieffer.  Find one!!!  Can't be done.Do you not see it?  Do you not recognize that this film has one foot firmly planted in the light comedy world, and another foot firmly planted in the incredible realism (almost too realistic) angst of a failing marriage?  Do you not see it?  Do you not hear Reiner's concerns projected in the scene where Willis requests to Reiser his dream of writing a book on his grandmother--is this not Reiner saying that he WOULD go further with the serious story here, but the audience, too set by his own past achievements, will not let him?  Is this not exactly what happened, when _Story of Us_ was released?Don't be fooled.  This is one serious movie.  It should be required viewing for all engaged couples. It's a fantastic wake-up call. The circumstances that lead up to the arguments are simplified, but the emotions are raw.  I repeat, time will be very kind to this movie.

I had been disillusioned by all these movies coming out that are basically the same and it was sort of refreshing to see that finally someone was trying something different. So I set my plans to include this movie--until I heard the reviews. Everyone seemed to hate this film--even my movie-loving cousin admitted she walked out in the middle because she couldn't stand it. She told me that it's more of a married person film than a film for teens like us, so I canned my idea. BIG MISTAKE! I wish I could have seen this marvelous film on the big screen--there's something about actors that makes them seem so much better when their faces are as big as you are. Not that that's necessary. After finally seeing the film (my mom bought it and forced me to watch it) it just made me realize why almost every movie now is a cliche some people cannot appreciate truly unique art, which is why I think this movie caught a bad rap.I honestly cannot say I have any first-hand experience on the subject of divorce. My parents are still married and have never really had to consider that option. I am still at that stage where marriage is a distant pit-stop on the road to my future. So why did I love this movie? It told me the truth. All of my life I have seen love depicted as an all-powerful, all-conquering thing. And I have no doubt that it is--this movie told me that too. But it also showed me that maybe being in love isn't always a perfect, happy thing. You've got to take the good and the bad. Ben said it best when he told Katie Nobody said it was going to be easy. Finally. Finally someone tells me it's NOT going to be easy. Now some people think that this film will make you not want to get married. I feel quite the opposite, because it shows you that if you truly love your partner you can get through the tough stuff.I don't understand how people can say this movie had bad acting. Were they watching the same movie I saw? Both Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer were amazing in this movie. I swear that as I watched them I completely believed they were a married couple. And the passion that went into their arguments was not overacting as I have seen it dubbed. Have you seen married people fight? It's just like that. And the good thing is the movie didn't choose sides. It just showed the arguments and the feelings behind them and left no one looking the bad guy. And Michelle Pfeiffer's beautiful performance during that closing monologue was worth watching the entire movie, even if you didn't like it. And the cinematography was brilliant. Sometimes flashbacks in movies can be risky, especially if they happen often as in this film. But the movie just seemed to flow wonderfully, and Katie's flashback in the car on the way to pick up the kids from camp is one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen in a movie. It's amazing to see 15 years of marriage in 15 seconds and not feel shortchanged. That scene captured everything brilliantly. And Eric Clapton's music adds a lot to the movie. He is definitely talented, but it's also because the music seemed to capture the mood of the film. All in all, this was an amazing experience and is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's funny, entertaining, moving, and very well-made. I'd recommend it to anyone. Even if you don't like it, you will take something from it.

Actually, it is more of a romantic tragedy than a comedy.  Ben and Katie Jordan (Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer) are two mismatched people in the marriage that never should have been.  He is spontaneous, romantic and impulsive, with low frustration tolerance and an explosive hair trigger temper.  She is pragmatic, a compulsive perfectionist with unrealistic expectations, and a high need for control. She takes everything personally and never forgives or forgets a slight.  They both blame each other for their disappointments.  The pattern is clear.  He doesn't meet her standards so she snipes, he explodes and then she accuses him of not listening.  She then throws up every mistake he's ever made and every fault he's ever had.  This goes on ad nauseam as their romantic obsession with one another continues to get the best of any sense they might have to call it quits.  Like moths to a flame, they keep returning for another scorching.  This film is thought provoking in that it portrays marital difficulties that are all too familiar in our society.  The problem is that it tries to give every problem known to man (with the exception of wife beating) to this couple and relies on the single strand of a long forgotten romance to be the only chance of keeping them together.In watching the behind the scenes featurette on this film, Rob Reiner and writers Alan Zweibel and Jessie Nelson discuss how the story evolved.  As it turns out, it was a montage of all their own marital problems.  So the film was, in essence cathartic dumping ground for the writers and director.As filmmaking, it was terrific.  Rob Reiner weaves the story together expertly, creating a stark contrast between the joy of the romance and the reality of the relationship.  The film was punctuated by numerous funny and sweet moments that make the viewer smile and glow with delight.Michelle Pfeiffer gives a splendid performance of a very emotionally complex and neurotic character.  It took a lot of courage for her to take this part because she was playing the least likeable character in the film, something of a departure for her.  Bruce Willis was as good as one could have expected considering the fact that nobody was blowing anything up.  Actually, he was quite good as the impulsive, childlike romantic, but when it came to the arguments and the serious displays of resentment, he played the scenes too harshly, almost commando style.Reiner does good camera work and puts together some good rapid fire scenes that have impact and give great insight into the relationship.  He also took the film on location in Venice to add a little romantic interlude, and somehow got Eric Clapton to write a great theme song.The problem is the story.  Reiner stated in the featurette that he intended this to be a realistic bittersweet look at the real problems relationships face.  But he tried to do too much and made this film a grossly exaggerated caricature of a relationship in crisis.  It is really The War of The Roses lite only it takes itself too seriously.  No one I know who saw this could believe that this couple could possibly have stayed married for 15 weeks, no less 15 years.  The result is a noxious marathon of petty arguments that get under the viewers' skin after a while.  It is about as entertaining as watching your best friends have a niggling argument in a public restaurant.  The whole thing leaves you very uncomfortable and you don't go home feeling like you've had a nice evening.So, while it succeeds as filmmaking, it fails as a film.  I gave this film a 6/10.  There were so many good elements to it that I can't see trashing it.  But the story is one that requires a level of emotional endurance that few viewers will be willing or able to invest to get any enjoyment out of it.

Miffed that I had allowed the opinions of others to steer me away from it until it came out on DVD. What a lovely bitter sweet/sweetly bitter film. After seeing The Story Of Us and talking to others about it, I came to the pejorative conclusion that the folk I spoke to just didn't get the film because they simply had not been there. I realized that no one I talked to at first had shared his or her lives with anyone for any more than a few years. This film deals with the daily wear and tear of ANY truly long-term relationship. It is an accurate, albeit theatrical, portrayal of the way high ups and devastating downs that can come to two people who love each other &#133; hate each other &#133; need each other &#133; want each other desperately &#133; hate each other some more and finally love each other again. I concluded that those who had never been to the end (and I mean the it's over and I am outta here end) of a relationship and still been able to pull away form the precipice and put things back together again, just didn't have a clue. So there my partner and I were after 16 years together truly touched by all that we saw, nodded our heads to, laughed at and balled our eyes out over and, in the end, really uplifted by in this gem of a film. Michelle Pfeiffer's final monologue alone would have been worth the price of a movie ticket just to watch &#150; All Actors should be made to watch her has she creates brilliant comedy by bursting into tears.

In all honesty, if I had seen this film in my early twenties (and I'm now almost 40), I wouldn't have appreciated its subtlety on long term relationships. It's aimed at those of us who have been married, or in a long term relationship. Although I don't have children, the rest of this movie had many oh yeah moments for me. The Story of Us, is a complex, yet ultimately simple, explanation of long term relationships...all those 'little' things about the other person that drive you insane about them, but that if you're both willing to work on, make the relationship all that much richer for it. Wonderfully thought provoking. If you have ever been in a long term adult relationship, I'd be hard pressed to see how you COULDN'T relate, at the very least, on some small level to this film.

But, the characters were tough to take. The self-pity was intercut with nice bits of comedy, but it felt like Reiner was cutting from a wake to a pratt-fall on occasions. The final scenes, with Pfeiffer's frightening display of multi-emotional skill (at once excellent and utterly ghastly),  betrayed the characters. Normality was implausibly resumed, and Pfeiffer came across as at fault for taking the whole film to get real, and Willis looked much relieved that she'd taken the sanity pill and he could quit trying to change himself.And the end was a surprise.

I cried. I cried before the opening credits song was more than a few lines in. It spoke to me like few movies have. It is the first movie about the subject of love that I've watched since I became this involved, physically and emotionally with my wife-to-be. That alone makes the movie have an impact on me, good or not. That it dealt with a subject that has so recently become so important to me. A successful marriage. But while I was this into the film, while it had this impact on me... I can't claim that it was great. The performances are. The editing is. The script is. Most of the parts are. But somehow, the sum, it just doesn't add up to being that... great. It might be that the ending feels flat. It might be that the movie offers no answers, only observations. The movie goes back and forth between present day chaos/unhappiness and fond memories... these were particularly difficult to watch without crying. This works to the film's advantage and creates a sense of more than a non-linear time-line; a life-time, years upon years of memories returning to this old married couple. The story of two people who love each other... they do. They've just tired of each other, of the differences, of the arguing. Comes very close to being great, but it just doesn't quite make it, I'm afraid. Worth watching for any fans of the genre, and has plenty of insights to offer.

The Jordans have been married for 15 years and have reached a turning point in their relationship. Authors Alan Zweibel and Jesse Nelson explore the past and present of the couple in a mosaic of vignettes throughout the years they have been together. There are scenes of joy, laughter, anger and frustration. The film basically takes place in the present as the teenage son and daughter leave for summer camp. The couple decides to separate during the summer vacation to re-evaluate their situation and spare the children any suffering. The scenes jump back and forth revealing the deterioration and lack of any real communication in their day to day life. Zweibel explained in an interview that the screenplay was somewhat autobiographical, but when he realized the script was somewhat one-sided (male) he joined with Jesse Nelson to rewrite the script and deliver a more realistic and even-handed reflection of the marriage. They are fairly successful. However, Willis' Ben seems to be the more sympathetic of the two. In one scene Ben has just begun dinner out with his two best friends,a married couple played warmly and humorously by Rob Reiner and Rita Wilson. In a loud eruption of anger and resentment he voices his emotions disrupting the quiet tone of the restaurant. He leaves the table and paces outside on the street. In this tenderly revealing scene Willis, without a word, shows the life-shattering trauma he is going through. Willis has developed into a fine and subtly sensitive actor. Just when the audience thinks all of its sympathies are on Ben's side, Katie has a 3-minute monologue in which she spews out her reactions to all that has happened. Pfeiffer's performance here is also a tour de force. If only what has come before had the power of these two sequences. Eric Clapton's music effectively underscores the highs and lows, his song quietly framing the beginning and ending of the film. Married folks will definitely identify with this couple. One could hear the sounds of recognition from the audience at the screening I attended. It remains to be seen if this story will attract and entertain a wide range of moviegoers.

Although many of his past characters are over-the-top, he never really plays them as such.  He has a subtleness that suits him, which is why he is as successful as he is.  Unfortunately, for a while, he has been typecast in his numerous action movies, that most of the general public has written him off as another cliché.  That's a shame.  His best performances, again in my opinion, have been in `12 Monkeys,' `Pulp Fiction,' `The Sixth Sense' and here as well.`The Story of Us' works in many ways.  The dynamic between Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer (an actress so wonderful that I can't put into words) is electric.  Their non-stop fights are involving, sometimes comical and often painful to watch, but in a good way.  There's a scene in the film when Bruce Willis is in a hotel and Michelle Pfeiffer is at home and they call each other back-and-forth, asking meaningless questions when the audience knows they want to talk about their martial problems.  It was fascinating to me.  Honestly, I have never seen the more successful `When Harry Met Sally&#133;,' sadly, but this film is constantly compared to it since both films were directed by Rob Reiner.  Rob Reiner is an eclectic director.  He has, virtually, covers all the genres in the business.  He has works ranging from romantic comedies (The American President, When Harry Met Sally&#133;) to dramas (A Few Good Men, Ghosts Of Mississippi) to fantasies (The Princess Bride) to suspense thrillers (Misery).There was some great supportive work from Rob Reiner himself, Rita Wilson and Paul Reiser.  There is a scene I remember from the trailer where Rita Wilson is going on a tantrum about her husband's misplacing of toilet paper.  I smiled in that scene in the trailer and I laughed out loud during the movie.  Interestingly enough, while I liked the couple's bickering, I guess the movie could have been more successful if it wasn't relying so heavily on it, thus keeping this film from being one of the very best of the year.  Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer are, in fact, at the top of their game and I liked their chemistry well enough to give it a strong recommendation.

Not just in it's delivery which I found to be excellent, but in what it offers to the public. Not many movies these days give you something you can take with you, this does...in barrels. If you are married or thinking of getting married it is a must see. I am shocked at the low rating this movie received from the critics. Maybe it is because we have come to expect nothing more from our movies than pure, unenlightened entertainment. This movie is the epitome of what researchers are discovering today in regards to our staggering divorce rates. Most people do not end up divorced because of huge catastrophes that occur in a marriage, they divorce because of all the little things that slowly deteriorate the climate of the marital relationship to the point that you forget your in love. You stop seeing the things that drew you together and life gets blurred by the collage of little nitpicking things, that then suddenly emerge as one horrific monster that engulfs the relationship. This movie puts that out there and says...wake up...don't sweat the small stuff. Remember the big picture. It calls attention for the dire need of couples to actively study positive communication and conflict resolution skills if they have any hope of maintaining their marriage. Cause it is the little things that get you in the end...and communication style is the key to it all.

All kinds of things in life add up ever since the two tie the knot. Will Snow White and Prince Charming live happily ever after? Well, it depends on them. Some marriages remain happy after decades; some break up after just a short period of time. Everyone manages their marriages differently. However, it's not easy to keep a marriage merry and happy.

Conflicts happen when they have different point of view on things and can't agree with each other or selfishly think each other is wrong. This film gives pretty sharp but real description of marriage, and also gives married people something to think about. A happy marriage doesn't come from out of the blue. It costs mutual respect, trust, and love. In movies, unhappy marriages can be fixed by romantic storyline, but in real life, it depends on couples themselves.

And you quickly realize that it's because `The Story of Us,' directed by Rob Reiner, is indeed a story about loss, which is something that affects everyone in some way or another, at one time or another, and depending upon your personal frame of reference and experience, it's a story that is going to affect you on any number of levels.  Because loss comes in many forms; sometimes it leaves nothing more than a blip on the surface of your Moon, while at other times it leaves a gaping crater on the landscape of your World, and whichever it is in your case, this film is going to address it and perhaps make you revisit a time or place that maybe you've locked away in the dim recesses of your memory for better or worse.  One thing is certain, this film is going to make you take pause and reflect for a moment or two.  Because `Us,' anyway you slice it, is a film about you and me.	Reflection is the key word here, for Reiner has crafted a film that is steeped in it; it's the way the characters involved play through the drama of their immediate lives and attempt to get on with it.  And it becomes an almost voyeuristic journey as you watch two people attempting to discover just what went wrong with their love, and not only when, but why.  Katie Jordan (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Ben Jordan (Bruce Willis) had it all at one time, but something happened; something in the fifteen years between the merging of two lives into one, during which they brought two children into the world and knew true happiness, and the realization that things had changed suddenly.  Or, perhaps, not so suddenly; and it's almost uncomfortable to be a part of it, observing from the sidelines and understanding what the principals involved simply can't seem to comprehend. 	It's the little things that are doing them in, and they just don't see it.  The main element being the inability to see themselves through the eyes of the other.  And it's not that they're self-centered by any means, it just a matter of instinctively wanting to maintain the autonomy that makes them unique, which in the beginning was what attracted them to one another.  It's a conundrum, and it's universal.  It's a matter of two people needing to reach that point-- which according to the individuals involved is going to vary greatly-- at which they can step outside of themselves and truly align their spirit with that of their significant other.  Some may call it unconditional love, but in reality it's something that goes beyond even that.  It's like discovering the meaning of life, or the true meaning of love.  And for some, it's something that unfortunately may forever fall just beyond their ability to grasp.	A dramatic film with comedic overtones-- inasmuch as life itself is often funny, even at the most inopportune times-- Reiner takes something of a `When Harry Met Sally' approach with it, which initially doesn't seem to work; after all, this is decidedly not a romantic comedy.  But as the story unfolds you begin to realize that Reiner knows exactly what he's doing, because in retrospect, this is the way it goes in real life.  Things may be disintegrating internally, but life goes on; where the good times and laughter prevailed before, it remains, undaunted by the strife it fails to recognize in it's midst.  So, in the end, you have to give Reiner credit for having his finger on the pulse of reality, which at the beginning of the film comes across as somewhat pretentious, but by the end makes perfect sense and works beautifully in the telling of this story.	Michelle Pfeiffer turns in a heartfelt performance as Katie, proving once again what a gifted actor she truly is.  Watching Katie, you know exactly what she is feeling and why, and Pfeiffer allows you to become emotionally involved to the point that you want to intervene and tell her you know what the problem is and how she can fix it.  Her Katie is a good person, a loving wife and mother, and you desperately want things to work out for her.  And it's frustrating to have to sit on the sidelines and be unable to help.  Which says something about the caliber of her performance.  It's that reality she brings to the character that draws you in so intimately, and it's one of the strengths of the film.	Another strong point is the performance of Bruce Willis, who as Ben continues to shed that tough guy, `Die Hard' persona and emerge as an extremely capable actor with a range that is expanding with every movie he makes, which he's demonstrated in such films as `Unbreakable' and `The Sixth Sense.'  Suffice to say that he's come a long way since his `Moonlighting' days.	The supporting cast includes Colleen Rennison (Erin), Jake Sandvig (Josh), Rita Wilson (Rachel), Rob Reiner (Stan), Julie Hagerty (Lisa), Tim Matheson (Marty), Red Buttons (Arnie), Jayne Meadows (Dot), Betty White (Lillian) and Tom Poston (Harry).  Ultimately a satisfying experience, `The Story of Us' will touch some nerves and may reawaken some disconcerting feelings in many who see it, but like life, it's an emotional journey worth taking.  It's a `Stop and smell the roses' kind of film, but without any maudlin sentimentality or melodramatics.  Well acted and presented, it's a film that is definitely worth a look.  I rate this one 9/10.

You just keep hoping they'll shut up quickly and go their own way, which ofcourse doesn't happen, because just in time (they must have known the film was finishing), Pfeiffers' character realises she needs her man.

And I hate when people in movies are supposed to be crying really hard but no tears come out, she did this in this movie.  And there was one scene where she makes this long speech and she's very upset and supposed to be crying but there's no tears and she's wining to the point where it's annoying and again it's not convincing, there doesn't seem to be the right feeling.  You could always feel Bruce Willis' sadness or happiness but I didn't get this from Michelle Pheiffer.  I liked the movie for it's realistic portrayal of what should be considered a happy marriage and it's just a nice story.

Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer give very convincing performances to portray the characters of Ben and Katie Jordan, a married couple that have, somehow through trivial matters of daily life, drifted apart from each other. In fact, the only thing that seems to keep them together is their kids, or a love that does exist, but is in a dormant phase right now. So when they separate after the children go away for a summer camp, each have sometime to sit and ponder over what went wrong and thus enlightening us with their past lives through flash backs. And then you feel heartbroken for the couple who started what seemed to be one of the most romantic lives together, ended up with screaming and shouting on matters so unimportant that you would hardly remember later. Katie starts to suspect that Ben is having an affair and Ben is angry that Katie has no time for him anymore. So the only direction this marriage was heading towards is downwards and the hill is pretty steep. But then as they try to finish of what to them has become a pain in the neck, they realize that they still love each other very much. But none of them wants to be the one to say it loud. In fact, Ben does tries to on a couple of occasions to talk their differences out but somehow it ends up making things worse. The final nail that's driven in the coffin is that Katie starts seeing a cooking class mate, nothing serious, but enough to make Ben realize that it just might be over between them.A word or two about the performances. Both of the lead stars have done a superb job, although you might feel that Michelle is a notch or two better than Bruce. But then I might have been smitten by her breathtaking beauty. She is really into her character, an average American housewife, with loads of domestic troubles. And Bruce, what a year he is having! First it was that brilliant performance in 'The Sixth Sense' and now this. He has proved that he is an actor par excellence and has the tendency to put up a great show whenever given an opportunity.

I give this bittersweet movie the highest recommendation. This story, regardless of your marital status will touch you deeply and beautifully. This is not a 'chick flick' either. Both women *and* men will see themselves in this all too truthful chronicle about a marriage coming apart at the seams. Not to worry -- for you die hard romantics, there are those inevitable flashbacks woven throughout - And they will tear your heart out. Bring tissue! The man in front of me (a *very* famous film critic who will remain nameless) was sobbing violently by the end of the film, as was most of the theater. And, (surprise!), many of the tear stained cheeks belonged to men - it's obvious that this movie touches a nerve and will hit very close to home for many. But oh, it's so worth it. I really cared about these characters; I winced with each argument and felt as though I too, was right there fighting, crying and hoping. We all wish for a happy ending, but this is real life. Will they live happily ever after? Or will years of built up resentment and apathy bring this union to a bitter end? The Story of Us opens October 15th -- don't wait until the 16th to see it.

The script is simply brilliant. It's a delightful, realistic, touching and insightful story (of us). It represents so many typical things of life we're all familiar with that it becomes an enjoyable -yet true to life- love story.Director Rob Reiner did a great job in making this film. The most surprising thing about his directing is the way in which he manages to do something which is actually against the rules of film making. At certain moments, he allows his main characters to watch STRAIGHT into the camera as they look back upon their lives and 15 years of marriage. This technique creates a different, almost interactive impression which is normally only used on television shows, interviews and commercials. In doing so, the director creates a virtual connection between the actors on screen and the people watching the film.Talking about characters who would Rob Reiner want for the married couple? This is another great thing about The Story of us. The actors are very well chosen. Bruce Willis does a great job and hereby proves that he's really grown as an actor throughout the years. I don't think he could have done the same great performance 10 years ago when he was still dodging bullets in Die hard. But even better is the acting of Michelle Pfeiffer. Now, I know it's hard to stay objective about her acting once you've seen her, but I think (apart from that everlasting beauty) this performance of hers is quite outstanding. And if you disagree with me on that, take a look at her famous monologue at the end of the film. This should prove of what a great actress Michelle Pfeiffer truly is!Of course, practice makes perfect! And to make sure that both actors would appear natural on screen, Bruce Willis started flirting with Michelle Pfeiffer everytime he saw her on the film set. After all, their characters were married to each other for 15 years and their job was to give that exact same impression. Although the flirting with Hollywood's most beautiful actress must have been a true joy for Bruce Willis; it also improved the acting of both actors.Last but not least there's Erik Clapton with his many wonderful songs which you can hear throughout the entire film.All things considered The story of us is one of the best romantic comedies I've ever seen  "},{"Title":"Good marriage-problem film that is not too sobby","Date":"23 December 2000","Score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  What I enjoyed about this movie, was the fact that it was fresh in the sense that this sort of story has never been portrayed like this (or I've just not seen it), for mostly films about a marriage crisis are destined to become real dramatic snooze &#150; feasts.

The Story of Us is, conversely, easily one of the worst.This is a film in which literally not one single element works effectively starting with its screenplay which actually took two people to concoct.  First of all, the writers fail to establish a credible context in which to examine this relationship.  Beyond a few unconvincing and corny flashbacks to supposedly happier times, we are given no inkling as to what drew these people to each other in the first place.  Worse, we are never really sure why this couple is so unhappy now.  They talk and talk yet never say anything that particularizes their situation or personalities.  The unhappiness is simply a given and all the shouting and slamming of doors can't hide the shallowness at the film's core.  This is a papier mache view of a crumbling marriage.Swirling around these two misbegotten central characters are the conventional married friends, who sit around in restaurants and carry out endless discussions about men and women and the relationships they forge that would embarrass a group of junior high school students with their shallowness and triteness.  Add to this, some silly, mood-shattering fantasy sequences (one in which the couple are joined in bed by their respective parents is particularly inappropriate and ill-advised) and one of the least convincing resolutions in movie history and you have a real recipe for cinematic disaster.This film establishes Reiner as one of the most uneven directors working today, able to produce works of real romantic quality like The Princess Bride, When Harry Met Sally, and The American President, then turn right around and deliver utter artistic disasters like North and now The Story of Us.  The latter even cribs badly from Reiner's own work, such as in the scene where Willis erupts embarrassingly in a restaurant, a charmless echo of the classic such moment in When Harry Met Sally.  To see how a disintegrating marriage should be dealt with on screen, check out two classics of the genre, 1967's Two For the Road and 1982's Shoot the Moon, both starring Albert Finney.

In my opinion, this movie does an excellent job of balancing between the two... Which to some may make it feel disjointed and not as smooth but I think it adds to the charm. I think one needs to consider how this movie could have been made. Yes it could have taken to the heights of what may be considered serious issues that arise through the course of 15-20 years of marriage ... But is that going to be entertaining and a pleasant way to spend your evening? Instead you see that the highlighted issues between Katie and Ben may seem initially trivial, comical, unrealistic (insert your own descriptor here), but does the heart of that issue not reflect some truth in what partners battle when being married for eons? I found it cleverly hidden to allow for people to identify and interpret as something that they could relate to... Not lets take the whole argument literally as that's exactly what happens to everyone, or on the other end of the spectrum... This mirrors your real life so much why the hell would you want to pay the price of a movie ticket to watch it on a big screen...Yes there is arguing... A lot of it... And certainly you probably need to have a certain sense of humour to get Willis and Reiner and their tops of the legs humour (which I personally found hilarious... Then again my humour is quite broad). Michelle's touching speech at the end is a bit hammy.... Again... I think it was meant to be.

Was it supposed to be therapeutic, attempting to help troubled marriages resolve their differences? Was it supposed to be a romantic comedy? Was it capitalizing on When Harry Met Sally? Well, it failed! It failed on all levels! The serious subject of marital crisis is given a superficial treatment here. The script and direction (not to mention the acting) never gives us a chance to dig deep into a serious matter - keeping our marriages going through troubles. Are we supposed to believe the kids just upstairs never hear the scream matches the parents have downstairs? Are we supposed to believe the arguments the parents have? Are the moronic and thoroughly unhelpful side characters anything more than a distraction to the movie? Marital stress can make for some hilarious moments in cinema. What couple hasn't been through arguments and fights? That's why we laugh when comedians make jokes about married life. We can empathize. But this movie sets up the dumbest and sometimes most offensive jokes. I sat watching uncomfortably rather than laughing. Because the script has the characters talking AT each other rather than really talking TO each other. Marriage is so rewarding precisely because it involves hard work and sacrifice for the greater good. That is why love making and conversational intimacy are always best after rough patches have been worked out and forgiveness has been given. This film left me wondering why this couple really wanted to stay together. If you are single, marriage is a LOT better than this film makes it out to be. If you are struggling with your marriage, don't use this film for advice. If you are someone looking for a romantic comedy, check out That Thing You Do or something like it.

It is unique enough to be believed. It goes beyond the masterpiece, it's the only one you can watch it everyday. It wasn't a movie about how great it is or how meaningful it can be. It is one of a kind that we all know about but couldn't solve it. It's a psychological myth in any relationship. Love is really a mystery. In this movie with no judgments, but exploring to our interrelationship to the maximum level. From the movie, I realized that the magic of love makes people believe and disbelieve as well.Love is much more complicated than the definitions you can find in the dictionary.

But even the best actors in the world can't breathe believable life into dialog that is overly flowery and complex. And this script is full of tongue-twisting speeches that Pfeiffer and Willis just can't overcome.In a way, the writing is actually pretty beautiful -- certainly it's far better than the tripe in most movies (and it's the only thing that elevates this much above a Lifetime, made-for TV flick). But it simply isn't the way that people talk. The dialog -- especially Pfeiffer's mouth- full-of-a-monologue at the end of the film -- is filled with unnecessarily big and non- conversational words and long, complex sentences that don't exactly trip of the tongue. Overall, that final scene was pretty touching, and the meaning of what Katie is saying is deep and important -- and ultimately, it's the only thing that makes the movie worth sitting through. But nobody talks like that. And then there are the scenes where the Ben and Katie talk to the camera, narrating the story. Again, if it was writing in a book -- prose as opposed to dialog -- I'd consider it quite good writing. But clunkers like ...maybe it was the stuff of life... (that separated us) are so distracting that they ruin the flow of the movie. The ultimate point of Katie's final speech, and I guess of the whole movie, is that you should choose to be with someone because of the quality of his or her character. Amen. But neither of these people really exhibited a depth of character to make them endearing to viewers or to each other. And even if someone has a sterling character, would you want to waste your life with a person who can't stop yelling at you? Though the movie doesn't take sides, I personally found Katie far more annoying than Ben -- and her rigidity, coldness, and inability to really communicate made it pretty unbelievable that Ben would want to stay with her. Life is too short to stay with someone you bicker that much with, in my opinion. It's true that sometimes you can find yourself in love with someone who really pushes your buttons. But there was never really a sense of these characters being in love, so I certainly didn't find myself rooting for them to work things out.One might make the point that parents should stay together for the children, but as the child of parents who argued a lot when I was young, and who now (divorced) say they stayed together for the kids, I strongly believe that parents don't do their children favors by doing that. I'll admit that maybe watching this sort of story was upsetting for me to endure because of that personal history. But from reading other readers' comments, it seems that not many people found this an enjoyable film to watch. (I'm not saying that every movie should make you laugh out loud, or feel better, or whatever ... but a movie like this is such a downer that it makes you want your two hours back.)I absolutely can't recommend this film if you have any other alternatives. If it's a choice between this and a rerun of Full House, I guess you could give this a try. But if there's some way you can just watch the last 10 or 15 minutes, that's about the only part worth watching.

Taking turns, the duo tells the audience, in flashback and present day, about their experiences which have led them to totter on the brink of divorce.  From their early married life to the birth of their two children, family dinners, the sometimes mundane household routine, their sex lives, and more, Ben and Katie try to reveal the necessary details. Close friends of the couple (Rita Wilson, Rob Reiner) chime in with their observations, also.  When all is said and done, will the couple uncover any reasons to stay together?This is a pleasing and often funny look at the realities of married life and what keeps couples together or drives them apart.  Ben and Katie are sometimes captivating, sometimes unsympathetic as their true natures are revealed.  Director Reiner uses the flashbacks and small pithy scenes to good advantage; the storyline is always intriguing but not confusing.  Willis and Pfeiffer ultimately create believable yet likeable characters we come to care about. Pfeiffer, indeed, has a strong, humorous speech at the end of the film which sums up the nature of marriage in a few ringing sentences.

When their two kids go off to camp for a few weeks they take the opportunity to have a trial separation.  The time apart gives them both time to reflect on their lives together.The opening scene is Ben talking to the camera and delivering a monologue about what he thinks a happy marriage is.  From this point in I felt that I was watching Rob Reiner trying to repeat the success of When Harry Met Sally.  In fact all the elements of that film are repeated here &#150; the witty banter with friends on the realities of life, the interviews, the time jumping etc.  And that is this film's main weakness &#150; it feels so very lifeless.  It isn't that it is a bad movie (it isn't) it's more that every scene has a feeling of a poor copy &#150; that you've seen it done better plenty of other places.This comes through in many ways.  The direction feels basic.  The script really doesn't bring the characters to life at all.  In the final scene of the film we were supposed to have an emotional moment but all I could think was `I really haven't connected with this film at all'.  The acting too feels like it is sub-standard.  Pfeiffer is not very good.  Anyone in doubt should check the final scene where her voice sounds like she is crying but no tears appear even though her face is scrunched up in effort to convey emotion!  Willis is OK but many of his lines sound like they were written for Billy Crystal.  In fact his character is better suited to Crystal and I think Willis knows it as he looks uncomfortable.  Maybe in his Moonlighting days he could have done this but not now.  Reiner is just doing his usual support act, Wilson is good, Reiser is OK, again doing his usual stuff, Matheson has a minor and not well developed role while Red Buttons is really just dropped in for character &#150; he certainly was used to good effect.Overall this film really feels like Reiner in a state of stagnation.  The film is not all bad (in fact is OK and I half enjoyed it) but it all feels like it is being put together out of a catalogue.  Many elements show signs of being unimaginative and mass produced and the vast majority of it has been done before (mostly by Reiner) and done better.  It's alright, but why not just re-watch When Harry Met Sally?

Reiser spouts his half-baked and sexist opinions to Willis (who, like the rest of us, doesn't seem to care). Wilson blabbers her cliched sexual annecdotes to Pfeifer while power walking (God, could these people be any whiter?), stuff something like Men can do it anywhere, anytime (not verbatim, but who cares?). So, this movie scores even lower for being another movie that forces us men to believe that in order to get a women in to bed, we have to practically shower them with praise and gifts and emotional support, while women just have to say something like Baby wanna boom-boom?

The underlying implication of their conversations spells true in many of us and are good for our own reflections.Coupled with Eric Clapton's groovy soundtracks, it really is a soothing film, appropriate for one who wishes to relax after a hard day's work and reflect on his/her own present relationship with anybody. It really makes us ponder about the reason why the magical moments disappears after a marriage...well, assuming you are married.There are also various humorous moments in the film but they are rather subtle.

The storyline is simply brilliant.  It's a delightful, realistic, touching and insightful story (of us).  It represents so many typical things of life that we're all familiar with that it becomes an enjoyable yet true to life-love story.The cinematography of this film might be plain and simple, but that's good enough since we're dealing with a comedy where a funny story is more important than great camera work.  After all, this is not a thriller or an action film in which the camera becomes an important part of the picture.  But still, director Rob Reiner did a great job in making this film.  The most surprising thing about his directing is the way in which he manages to do something completely unexpected; something that is actually against the rules of filmmaking.  At certain moments, he lets his main characters watch STRAIGHT into the camera as they look back upon their lives and 15 years of marriage.  This is typical non-fiction-stuff that is normally only used for television for instance on television programs, shows, commercials, interviews and television news.  But it doesn't mean because something is hardly ever done that it is bad right away.  I think this great and original technique of his works very good, as this is the first way of getting to know the characters of the film.Talking about characters whom would Rob Reiner want for the married couple?  This is another great thing about The Story of us.  The actors are very well chosen.  Bruce Willis does a great job and hereby proves that he's really grown as an actor.  I don't think he could have done the same great performance 10 years ago when he was still dodging bullets in Die hard.  But the greatest acting in this film comes from the beloved (queen of beauty) Michelle Pfeiffer.  Now, I know it's hard to stay objective about her acting once you've seen her, but I think (apart from that everlasting beauty) this performance of hers is quite outstanding.  And if you disagree with me on that, take a look at her famous monologue at the end of the film.  This should prove of what a great actress she's become through the years. Of course, practice makes perfect!  And to make sure that they wouldn't appear too stiff on the screen; it was Bruce Willis' idea of flirting with Michelle Pfeiffer every time he saw her on the film set.  Pfeiffer agreed on that and from that moment on Bruce Willis had the time of his life.  I mean, name one guy who wouldn't like to flirt with Michelle Pfeiffer. Call it pleasure, call it work &#150; neither of them DID appear stiff on the screen and in fact they were so natural-behaved that I personally felt they could have been married to each other in real life as well.I think there's only one more thing to say about this film and that would be concerning the music of Erik Clapton.  The songs that he brings throughout the entire film are wonderful as well as his ability of playing the guitar.All things considered The story of us is one of the best romantic-comedies I've ever seen.

I originally saw it in the movie theatre, with my best friend and two married friends; one had a wonderful marriage in her life, and the other whose marriage had fallen apart years ago.  At the time, I was single and it touched me like nothing else; it seems to change your mind quite often, and you don't know if you want to take sides or just cry from beginning to end and know that things will work out. If you watch this film when you are single, it sort of makes you not want to be with anyone, because you don't want to go through the pain that is in this movie that the characters go through. But if you are with someone, you fear that those things will happen; or if they don't, you look into the future and think Wow, those two were together for so long and they fell apart from each other. I had my mother watch this movie who was married twice, and married to my father for 17 years.  When she watched it, she was quiet through the entire thing, and sort of shook her head alot.

At the right time, this film has some keen observations on romance (notefully by Rob Reiner and Paul Reiser) and throughout has some nice performances (despite Pfieffer's sometimes overacting), but is mainly done in by sitcom dialogue in important scenes (dialogue sometimes so cheesy you wouldn't even find on Seventh Heaven) and corniness.

He picks his own projects in a way that I always applaud him. This movie delineates very important differences between men and women, their feelings, and their behavior.The key reason of the low ratings, in my view,  is because there is a generational conflict here. I have asked young married people how the was movie, and they said that they didn't like it. I talked to people in their forties,  fifties, and they loved it.  Their comment it usually is It is reality.  The younger couples, the ones that are engaged, just don't get it yet.  They are in a different stage in their lives. They have not been married 15 years like the couple in this movie was.  What this movie proposed to do was to show what happens if people take each other for granted. They behave like Sally indicated in When Harry Met Sally,  words once said are out there and cannot be taken back. The movie concentrated on the conflicts that lead almost to the destruction of their marriage. To bring all those conflicts to light in a funny way took a lot of talent. That is why we need Rob Reiner. Bruce Willis (The Sixth Sense, Nobody's Fool),  Ben Jordan,  is trying very hard. Actually Bruce Willis surprised me with some of his roles  as I have seen very few of his movies, not enjoying action movies. He is good! The reason I do not see much of his acting is because of  the projects he picks.  They seam too violent. Michelle Pfeiffer (One Fine Day) is good in the part of  Katie Jordan.  The story is told by Ben's perspective, she appears to be holding on to the things that don't matter more than he is. I recommend the movie, but if you are very young you will not understand it, even kids of divorced parents do not get it.  I credit the low ratings to that. Some people just don't get the movie because they haven't been there in their relationships. I think it is very insightful into marriages in general. I can say that because I have been happily married for almost twenty-three years.  Unfortunately there are tons of couples that live just like that.The question raised is Can a marriage survive 15 years of marriage?  Yes it can, if Ben and Katie's did.  They took each other for granted most of the time.   My favorite quotes Katie Austin has a turtle that snores.  Ben No one designated you. You designated yourself. KatieYou love who we were, you could not want what we become, somehow you get use to the disconnection. Favorite Scenes When Katie finally recognized that friends are hard to find.

While their children, Erin (Colleen Rennison) and Josh (Jake Sandvig) are away at summer camp, Ben and Katie tell about the highs and lows of their fifteen year marriage, and remember both the good times which seem to bring them closer again and the bad times, which totally tear them apart...again.  Yet beyond the heated arguments between Mr. and Mrs. Jordan, there are Ben and Katie's strong, passionate feelings for each other...which could possibly bring hope in saving their marriage.The Story of Us is a sappy love story for just about anyone!  Okay, it's not the BEST or most brilliant movies I ever seen, but perhaps, this film can teach valuable lessons of what true love is and of course that sometimes the bad times in a relationship of any kind can bring partners closer together...especially if they've been married for fifteen years!!! ) What I liked about this film was the moments of bubbly humour in which some of the characters brought on-screen (i.e. the ever annoying Andy and Joanie Kirby played by Bill Kirchenbauer and Lucy Webb during the I HATE THE KIRBY'S part of the movie), and the senseless fights between Ben and Katie.  One thing's for sure, you can easily see the guilt in their eyes after they fight!  Yet that's kind of cute!  Though it's obvious that they love each other still...this movie still keeps you still on your seat...wondering what might happen next or what crazy little subjects Ben and Katie might fight over again and again!They kind of remind of Ricky and Lucy Ricardo from I Love Lucy only they are living in a different decade...they have more children...and they curse more (well...duh)!  Yet like Ricky and Lucy, they seem to fight over stupid things, which is normal in any relationship, right?  But of course...some of the issues they did fight over were kind of serious and maybe important to them personally.  From Ben's complaints about Dot (Katie's mother) to Katie's complaints about the other woman in which her husband denies.

If you think that one romantic song playing while the word us goes up and down, from one side to the other in the screen is annoying and that the first scene, when Katie (Michelle Pfeiffer) looks direct to the camera, alone, sitting in a sofa, and starts to talk about her wedding as in one documentary, is boring, you possible won't like it. But if you like one or both, as I did, you will for sure love The Story Of Us. The film is about one couple, Ben and Katie. They're married for about 15 or 17 years and they can't stand 15 minutes without one fight. As their children are in a Summer Camp, they're going to use that time alone to see if must stay married or divorce. Their situation is so serious that Ben will stay in a hotel while Katie will stay at their house. Most of the movie are past situations remembered by the couple. And that's the best thing about The Story Of Us. They're always reminding funny and happy situations but at the present time they just fight and fight. So, you have 10 minutes of romantic-comedy then 10 minutes of drama. And you don't even know what to fell. Should you laugh at the funny things or remember that these funny things are being shown because they're missing them, because nowadays they're just the opposite? Michelle Pfeiffer and Bruce Willis were great. I still think that watching Bruce in dramatic movies is a bit strange but as I had already seen his good performance in The Sixth Sense, I'm losing my preconception. And Michelle is perfect (as always) and just like the movie her face is so delicate, she looks sooooo fragile and nice but in fact her character, Katie, is very nervous and incomprehensible. So, that's how The Story Of Us is very realist. Don't expect a super-romantic story but a dense and real relationship with fights, screams, shouts and sometimes, kisses. In fact, that's the kind of relationship that we all have! And, to conclude, is The Story Of Us a highly recommendable film? Well, it's not a everybody-love-movie as The Sixth Sense but I think so.

Add to this the dominance of flashbacks which are chronologically out of order and the viewer is not sure what is in the present and what lies in the past (with the exception of the long-haired Bruce Willis--definitely the past!).  Pfeiffer's speech may have come at the end, but it could easily have been thrown in the middle, so one should not assume her words will stick!  Such is the nature of a long-term relationship, aptly portrayed in this movie.On a humorous note, one could say the scenes were filmed out of sequence, as are those of all movies--then simply left that way!  A rare case where the finished product looks like a rough cut that was accidentally delivered to the distributor!In an attempt to rise above the enormous body of work concerned with relationships, this film touches on well-used concepts, then moves on--notifying the viewer that THIS time around, all hope may truly be lost  As though wishing to adhere to a script, one of the partners says, Isn't this the point where we say this is going way too far and just make up?--nevertheless, the front door slams.  This is comparable to Scream, which was scary because it acknowledged previous devices--e.g., 'dumb blonde runs upstairs when she should be running outside,' 'don't ever say you'll be right back, because you won't'--before moving on to the next murder.However, three traditional elements remain1)  Females are more perceptive.  Pfeiffer has no trouble understanding her girlfriends' advice, but Willis is unable to decipher Reiner's 'top of the legs' analogy.  The daughter is overwhelmed with the realization that her parents' problems have reached the breaking point while her older brother remains blissfully unaware--an indication that when the children mature and find partners, the disparity will live on!2)  The woman is better able to express herself verbally.  This is in spite of her husband's being a writer by profession (albeit one who's been having trouble finding the right words to type into his computer) while she merely assembles fragments into crossword puzzles ('RA' was not only the Egyptian sun god but stands for 'regular army'!).3)  Pfeiffer is emotionally more manipulative.  The couple plan to tell the kids they have  moved apart, but in reality, she holds the fishing rod, hoping he will keep taking the bait.  When he comes over for dinner, he reveals that his low that week was being away from her;  she replies that her low was finding that a new kitchen appliance failed to work as promised.  Also, she continues to upbraid him for speaking intimately with another woman over the phone six months prior while she flirts with another man in her cooking class.All in all, a good combination of old and new ideas.

But, in keeping with his downward spiral, Rob Reiner has managed once again to make a totally joyless and completely bungled movie. The problems begin immediately as the film's first few scenes take place with our leads already at each others' throats, but with no clear reasons for their shared unhappiness. All we know is that what once kept them together now keeps them apart, but whatever this cause is is kept under wraps, the final effect being that because you don't quite understand WHY these things are happening, you really don't CARE. This is hardly helped by the screenplay, which flashes back and forward so much it may be a danger for epileptics! To say it's choppy is mild, indeed! As for the performances, Bruce Willis comes off best he attempts to give his turn with just the right hint of humor and pathos, and largely succeeds despite Michelle Pfeiffer's efforts never once is she on the same level as Willis -- it's as if they're acting on different planets -- and not for a moment do you ever believe they'd be a couple. They share zero on-screen chemistry. It doesn't help that she is painted as utterly shrill. But the worst, undoubtedly, is Miss Rita Wilson (a woman I find very appealing as an actress) apparently taking a cue from her hubby Tom Hanks' Forrest Gump performance (which was about as subtle as one of those black velvet paintings of Elvis), she overplays what is obviously intended to be this film's equivalent of the touchstone 'orgasm in the deli' scene from When Harry Met Sally (Think I'm kidding? Well, in an audience of, say, 2 dozen, there was NOT ONE LAUGH.) The nadir occurs approximately halfway through when, prompted by a psychiatrist's theory that six people are in the marital bed (the couple and each set of parents), our leads imagine their parents beside them; at this point, I was not the only person in the theatre squirming with boredom -- I know because I took a break from all the hilarity to scan my fellow movie-goers for their reactions and I must say I was heartened to see reactions usually reserved for hemorrhoid attacks.

I had some reservations when I heard that the same people who did the screenplay for Stepmom had a hand in this, but thought I'd give it a shot anyway. Guess I should have listened to my gut. The worst was the married couple that Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer meet in Europe. These people acted like a pair of blithering idiots for no other reason than to hang the plot up on another possible resolution between the bickering protagonists. They were not even remotely real as human beings. I can't imagine anyone acting the way these did, and I have met a great many people in my life.A good premise wasted by cheap gags, and even the scenes that are somewhat effective are ultimately sunk by the lousy dialogue. It's hard to care much about people who routinely go into screaming fits in public places, or openly talk about sex and spout the F-word in restaurants. I'm not a prude who is offended by language, but in real life if a group of men or women went to a restaurant and started talking the way these people did, they'd probably be asked to leave. The characters in this film were so shallow and self-absorbed that it was difficult to connect with any of them. It seems that this is what passes for humor and dialogue in movies these days. Doesn't anyone remember the good old days, when humor in a film came from the situation, and how people reacted to it? You could laugh at it because it rang true to life. No, these days screenwriters are content to take the easy way out, with quick one-liners and lazy writing. This wraps up awfully quick, too. Seems like years of resentment and anger melt away in the blink of an eye with Pfeiffer's final speech. Doesn't work that way. Sorry, but I did not like these people.

The plot is about a not-so-happily married couple who attempt a trial separation while their children are away at summer camp.  Throughout the film the two belabor their relationship and are continually reminded by their friends that their unhappiness is par for the course and that they must learn to accept it in order for their marriage to survive. I'll get right to the point now.  I had a lot of problems with this movie.  First and foremost, Reiner has become yet another director to attempt to present a narrative best left in the hands of Woody Allen.  The scattered narrative here is annoying. In scenes where Reiner breaks down the 'fourth wall' we are left watching something that is perhaps mildly amusing, but definately forced.  The plot in this film is hardly believable enough and the characters are hardly original enough for Woody Allen-esque narrative to work.  A scene in which the couple discuss their various attempts at therapy shows them in bed with their parents.  The dialogue here could have been funny if it happened in something like Annie Hall.  Instead, it comes across as crass and just plain silly.Both Pfeiffer and Willis are capable actors, but they don't seem to have what it takes to make this one work.  Pfeiffer's character creates crossword puzzles for a living and Willis is a writer.  I didn't believe for a second that either of them cared about their work, each other or those children. Some of the supporting characters in this film are annoying, not to mention blatant Jewish stereotypes.  Reiner's character (yes, he has a role) is fixated on his bowels. Rita Wilson plays his wife, and I hate to say it, but she should stick to being Mrs. Tom Hanks.  I got the feeling that she took acting lessons from Carrie Fisher.  On the other hand, Julie Haggarty plays a small part, and I was delighted to see her again.  She plays her typical dippy role here, but there is talent in her performance and I kept hoping to see more of her.I had a great deal of difficulty believing the plot.  It's sad to say, but who really stays together for the sake of the children any more?  And if they do, are they really doing the children a service?  If it ain't working, and it can't be fixed, then move on.  At best, this movie might serve as a great 'chick flick', a mildly entertaining film for people who like to weep at movies.  Otherwise, watch American Beauty if you want to see a film about the breakup of a family, or rent Kramer Vs. Kramer is you want to see a realistic film about divorce.  The Story of Us is far too simplistic and way too idealistic to be taken seriously.

What a dreadful disappointment.The trailer/commercials for this movie make it look somewhat interesting, because it gives you a quick snippet of what has happened in Ben and Katie's lives together (with children Josh and Erin sprinkled throughout). You would think when the actual full-length movie is front of you, the scenes would develop what you see in the commercials. Guess again! The life-flashing-before-your-eyes look at life is what we get in the full movie. Instead of developing these moments, we get brief glimpses while the other 100 minutes or whatever (felt like four hours) were filled with redundant plot devices (OK, you've called each other for the sixth time and said nothing but are the kids OK followed by awkward silence ... we get it) and unfunny humor, which is mainly of the toilet manner (literally--the empty toilet paper roll is much funnier in the trailer than it was in the movie; Reiser and Reiner tend to keep the conversation on the subject of the skin flute). The dialogue that I assume was intended for comic relief was as painful to listen to as any of the Willis-Pfeiffer conversations.The acting of Willis and Pfeiffer wasn't bad, but the ending is not believable at all (another case of wrapping a movie up simply because it's nearing two hours and we need a resolution, no matter how flimsy). It was so formula -- I was halfway expecting one of those endings where they give you the summary of what they are doing now. You know, Katie turned her life around and is now donating time at the local animal rescue league. Erin is on the debate team ...; that kind of thing. And another thing My fiancee and I both turned to each other during the climactic scene and wondered why the hell the kids, who had been so nosy earlier in the movie on almost every occasion, hadn't stuck their heads out of the car to see what the hell Mom was going on and on and on and on and on about ....This was painful to watch, and not in a good way. Some movies tug at the emotions, bringing out the tears or joy or anger or fear ... this movie only brings boredom. The bad writing could have been compensated by good timing, but every time the movie attempted to find some rhythm, there would be one of those awful scenes where one of the characters would be in a room by themselves talking to the camera! Another annoying trend of current cinema/television lumped right on top of this scrap heap of a vehicle. Save your money for upcoming releases.

This movie works best if you've been through such a situation yourself, but also works on an emotional enough level to make anyone contemplating divorce cause to stop and think.Bruce Willis sheds his action role suit and effortlessly slips into Ben, a man who after 15 years of marriage, has to adjust to the fact that its over. He does a wonderful job, and clearly some of the emotions regarding his split with Demi show through.Michelle Pfeiffer does her usual great job as Katie.  She too does an outstanding job of portraying a woman dealing with her impending divorce. You lose yourself in her portrayal....with the most shining moment coming during a rambling speech at the end of the movie.Rob Reiner and Rita Wilson lead the supporting cast as Ben & Katies friends....She's a bit brusk and obnoxious, and he seems a bit overly passive and distant when dealing with Bruce's character..but overall they dont detract too much from the movie.

Advertised as a comedy, and even verified as such by the director, this film does not have one semi amusing part in it.  The problem is that there are scenes which are meant to be humorous, not in the laugh out loud way, but in the way that little things can make serious situations  amusing, but they do not work.  This film is about as exciting as watching paint dry- nothing happens, there are no compromises and no one really discovers anything they didn't already know.  In one scene Paul Reiser as Willis' agent states that people who have very little leisure time don't want to read about a persons life that they didn't know, and wasn't famous- it seems pointless. In a few words- we don't want to watch it either!  The filmmakers should have thought about this, because that's what this film is- pointless.  There is some good acting, and it may be true about there being 6 people in the bed - but do we really want to know about it over 90 minutes.

Blow by blow, the movie draws to a predictable Hollywood conclusion with a flurry of flashbacks so ridiculously done and one particular flashback frighteningly and pornographically out of place, that it is all way too little and way too late for any sort of redemption.

Their smiles and joyful expressions make one wonder why no other casting director has come up with the idea of having the two of them star in a romantic comedy before. Unfortunately, Rob Reiner's The Story of Us, isn't about marriage, love at first sight, or happy times, but about an unhappy couple's divorce procedures and how two people can fall out of love in a matter of time. How depressing, indeed. The film consists of dozens of unorganized flashbacks explaining to us the up's and many down's of a married life in America, as well as the two past love birds, Ben and Katie Jordan's, attempts to keep their marital problems from their two young children.The individual scenes featuring Ben and Katie either bonding or fighting are at times quite powerful and involving, as well as some emotionally on target moments along with some funny humor present--but all the good sequences are brief and chopped-up. The story is so uneven it's very hard to become intrigued with anything going on. There is a nice sequence that takes place in Italy where Ben and Katie try to escape from their problems and jump start their love--what they don't realize is that their good old selves will be waiting on the front porch when they return home.  The problem with the film's singular scenes being effective is that they do not all fit together like they should, not to mention the heartache to develop and introduce the main characters through the flashbacks.  That is not an easy thing to do, and The Story of Us is not a smart enough movie to figure out how to do those things properly. The characters are acutely quite the treat. They are wonderfully played by top notch actors, some not commonly known for such roles as these, including Bruce Willis, Michelle Pfeiffer, Rob Reiner, Rita Wilson, and even Mad About You's Paul Reiser. There's much charming romantic chemistry between Willis and Pfeiffer, but like I said, all the characters do is argue and swear at the other. The kids aren't detailed enough to care about, thus we don't care about the turning point in the middle of the film. Pfeiffer's performance at the very end of the movie, where it should be serious and intense, comes off as whiny, sissified, and annoying. I can't figure out how she screwed this one up. She's a good actress, right? The structure in The Story of Us, is anything but ordinary. Author Thomas Pope once said that there is such a justification in the extremely rare case of a movie being about life the structure called life. There are certain incidences here that have a first act, second act, then conclusion, but no outright formula. But in this rare exception, the structure's material is fitting. Life has no structure to it, and for this movie to contain such realism, it must also not. This makes the story believable, engaging, and realistic; this reminds me of what many couples go through in present day in America. The Story of Us, contains such a flawed motive it's hard to imagine how this project could have worked. While I won't reveal the film's ending, I will say that the filmmakers throw their preparation for a depressing finale out the window and give us a conventional, but satisfying, conclusion. Perhaps if the writers would have used the flashbacks in sequence order, or taken a completely different view at the events, maybe through the eyes of the kids, possibly then the movie would have been a success. It is hard to tell, really. I personally think this film was doomed before it got the green light. It isn't the actors' faults, nor necessarily the director, Rob Reiner. It's just everything combined in a negative way.There is a scene in The Story of Us where the meaning of the message in this movie flashes before our eyes. It is a sequence present in the film's trailers, and is made up of Katie's brief, intercut flashbacks reflecting back on all the good and bad times of the their 15 year marriage. The scene works in every way possible. And in some ways, it makes a long story short for us, summing up the entire film's existence. I don't know why this scene is so effective, but I do know one thing if the entire movie was as focused and meaningful as that, we may have had something here.Brought to you by Universal Pictures.
