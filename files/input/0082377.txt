According to the documentary 'The Omen Legacy' the original plan was for 7 total films, but producer Harvey Bernard and Twentieth Century Fox settled on 3. Now this was probably a smart thing to do, because you could only take this story so far until people would be tired of it. 'The Final Conflict' would be the long-waited finale to the series and was much anticipated. To the dismay of many who saw it, it was not the grand finale it should have been. It's sort of a cross between the first two films. On one hand it has more story and less blood and gore, but on the other it seems a bit more concerned with spectacle than telling a good story and ending the series in a satisfactory way. That doesn't mean this film isn't any good, but if you like the first two then you will likely be underwhelmed by the end result.Pros Fine work done by the cast. Jerry Goldsmith composes a different, but still excellent score. Some elaborate and creative death sequences. Moves at a decent pace. Well photographed and nice scenery. A stronger, more layered script than last time. Has quite a mean streak.Cons Lacking in scares and tension. Some things are too underdeveloped. The ending is a letdown for this film and the series as a whole.Final thoughts After a series starts so well you hope the level of quality stays high in the subsequent installments. In the case of the 'Omen' franchise it did take a dive after the first film, but both theatrical sequels are still above average and worth the viewers time. They could have been better, especially this one, but unlike some sequels they aren't an embarrassment.My rating 3.5/5 "},{"Title":"Damien comes into his own.","Date":"2 February 2004","Score":"21 out of 24 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":"   In the first two Omen films, we were presented with a boy learning to adjust to his unusual personality and his future position in the destiny of the cosmos, but in this last film, Damien is in complete control as he prepares mankind for a  paradise of pain.

Even though the atmosphere bounces from materialistic to spiritual, the film still gets a powerful message about corporations and their link to politics to the audience. Again, Sam Neill shows us a flawed, but arrogant man-beast, who pushes his way through without a backward glance. With such a performance, it is no wonder that Sam Neill is a great actor.

It's said that Sam Neill who plays Damien and Lisa Harrow who plays Kate Reynolds were actually falling in love for real as this movie was being made. It really shows! Aside from being just gorgeous, Lisa Harrow was a good actress. You can see that her character has at least three sides to her. As a reporter, she's intrigued by Damien's vast wealth and growing political power. As a mother, she's frightened of his influence over her troubled teenage son. And as a woman, she can't help responding to the sheer excitement of his darkly sexual charisma. But what makes this interesting is that the story line always treats her character with respect. Her sexual feelings don't cancel out her heart or her intelligence, they just make her more mature and sympathetic.

If you haven't seen it in ages, I would suggest getting hold of a copy of the DVD 25TH ANNIVERSARY TRILOGY to sample it again. THE FINAL CONFLICT, like THE BLACK HOLE and TRON in widescreen DVD, looks, sounds and feels better than in their original VHS versions.As always, I won't give away the essence of it, except to say that certain visuals make a lot more sense (the widescreen image does do justice to this, as you see a lot more of the frame) and Sam Neill's portrayal of Damien is even more chilling this time around. Granted, some of the plot points may throw you a bit and logic may win out, but some of the scenes make even more sense than they did initially (Think the complexities of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE'S plot to get an idea of what I am thinking here!!).One other thing which may throw audiences is the English setting of the film, (but THE OMEN was set in London as well!) compared to the American setting of OMEN II, but bearing in mind that the saga has evolved with the characters, this is a strong point. It is also refreshing to have an American-made film which doesn't resort to too many stereotypes like WAYNE'S WORLD and THREE MEN AND A LITTLE LADY didJerry Goldsmith's score is the best he did out of the three films.Take another look - you may be pleasantly surprised.....

The other two were made in the seventies thus bestowing coolness upon them. At the start of the film Damien is sitting in a viewing theatre and is somewhat miffed. Trite, cliched, inane he complains. But enough about 'The Final Conflict' Damien, what about the advert you just watched? The eighties are truly upon us and are apocalyptic. Poor Sam Neill was described as a 'hacktor' after appearing in this but just how do you go about playing the Anti-Christ? Dracula disappears for most of Bram Stoker's novel to great effect and the best move would have been to do a 'Dead Zone' type plot with one man having visions after shaking his hand and trying to off him for the duration with Damien very much in the background. Instead, Neill goes for a hilarious pantomime turn of twitches, eyeball rolling, furtive glances and failed charm. All that is missing are the cape, mustache and tall black hat. His speech is mannered. The daggers are the only thing on EARTH...(pause)...that can kill me. DAN-DAN! Not the only thing, script starvation is another. This portentousness extends to the incomprehensible Father DeCarlo. The mark, 66.....(long pause)...6! Did he forget? It's not like a long zip code, is it? What you also don't want to do is hire a British tv director (Graham Baker) to direct a genre he is unfamiliar with. The action mostly revolves around people coming in and going out through doors and the set-ups are flat. Hey, Graham, horror films have lightening, don't they? So bung them in too in a highly risible manner, knocking a man off his feet in Keystone Cops fashion. Another problem is Jerry Goldsmith's score which makes an old style Ben Hur epic sound like a mere tap on the door. It's deafening appearances during the staid proceedings is laughably incongruous.The devil changes his modus operandi in this film. Why the change from crow to dog? Well, in a recent London stand up comedy act, a comedian found that the duck he hired cost £250 a day, £100 more than the Equity standard actor's pay for a WEEKS work. So he hired an actor in a duck's costume, I kid you not. So the change to a dog is not just satanic, it's smart. This dog is unusual though, it's point of view shot when stalking the American Ambassador in Hyde Park appears to be floating at least a foot off the ground and doesn't disturb twigs. Damien later explains that the breed once marched with the imperial Roman army. Must have been a sight, a load of soldiers with a row of dogs floating in the air. Keeps the sand off their paws, I guess. But a man's best friend is not his dog but his personal secretary. Harvey Dean (for it is he) reminds me of the hilariously inept personal secretary played by Barry Foster in the 'Sweeney!' Film, only going one better and adding baby killing to his CV. The none-too-bright Dean happily twitters on to Damien about family life seemingly unaware, unlike the rest of us, that the devil has a propensity towards nihilism. But unlike Barry Foster, Dean's assassins are competent and it's the God Squad's (on a sacred mission) that are inept. And don't say they're not used to that sort of thing, have you forgotten the Spanish Inquisition? Anyway, one of DeCarlo's priests goes to kill Damien in a tv studio. From, ahem, a gantry. What was he planning to do, jump down, break both his legs then crawl over to Damien and try and stab his toes? Embarrassed by this incompetence, Father DeCarlo tells the other priests that this time they're going to plan things down to the finest detail. So two of them wait in some ruins while another priest lures Damien to his demise. Sadly they get stuck in a hole, doomed to starvation. But hang on, doesn't planning down to the finest detail entail everyone knowing where they were heading thus ensuring a search party? But it's only me who thinks of these little things, such as Damien moaning to Dean that Christians like sticking to the letter of their prophecies. But do they? Killing Damien on consecrated ground and crucifying him with all seven daggers seems to have gone out of the window. Also 'Revelations' states that Christ will do battle with the Anti-Christ but he doesn't. Probably because he's a little short. In fact, he's a baby, a salient point lost on our Damien who stalks through an Abbey yelling, come out and face me, Nazarene! Er, Damien, he's a baby. He can't even walk yet. Do you expect one of the priests to run out and try and nut you with him? Instead, Damien is stabbed in the back by a journalist. Honestly, as the son of Satan he really should have seen THAT one coming.This film bludgeons you with pious scriptures and pompous choirs but is hypocritically exploitative. The series was silly but tapped into superstitions supposedly forgotten in this secular (yes, made it!) age, so it's a shame they went for easy sleazy rather than something thoughtful. What if, as a recent song writer posed, you had to believe in Jesus and the saints? If it was all true? The theological, moral and historical implications would have made for some philosophically interesting films. 'The Final Conflict' throws away the really big philosophical question of history, what is evil? Damien says that true evil is as pure as innocence and that people confuse it with their own lusts and perversions. The trouble is Damien has a statue of Christ crucified the wrong way to a cross and also sodomises his girlfriend Kate Reynolds telling her, birth is pain, life is pain, beauty is pain, which suggests he's a bit confused as well. But Satan, being the father of lies, is bound to produce a hypocrite. The other problem with this film is Damien isn't really, well, evil enough. He's big on hyperbole Grandeur of melancholy, divinity of loneliness, God doesn't lift a finger to do any housework etc, but he's only managed the death of a few relatives himself. What's shocking about being the head of a multi-national corporation nowadays? Thorn produces everything from Nuclear weapons to Soya Beans, but if you've ever been to supper at my mother-in-laws you'll know which is more lethal. Damien involves himself with a coup in Botswana to gain financially for Thorn industries and set himself favourably up with the president, while blithely missing the fact that with a bit more effort he could have stirred some real trouble up in the middle East between two of the worlds oldest religions, thus precipitating armageddon well ahead of schedule. It does at least prove however, that although the devil may have all the best tunes, don't hold your breath for the CD; he's a real slacker. In fact, the most shocking moments in the whole film come when Kate Reynolds (a BBC journalist, no less!) Seems to approve of her son fox hunting and being traditionally blooded and also let's a complete stranger into her house late at night just because he tells her he's a priest. A sobering thought for our non-secular times. Oh, ****!

Taking the position Damien moves to London & becomes romantically involved with a TV news-reporter named Kate Reynolds (Lisa Harrow), however he has bigger issues on his mind as a triangular star configuration signals the birth of the second coming of Christ somewhere in Britain so he orders his worshippers to kill every baby boy born on the same night. If that wasn't enough a group of seven priest's from Italy now possess the seven daggers of Meggido which are the only things on Earth which can kill Damien & are on a mission to do just that, an Antichrist's life is just never easy is it?This English American co-production was directed by Graham Baker & I actually thought it was a decent horror film that passed the time harmlessly enough. The Final Conflict was the third entry in The Omen (1976) series of films & while probably not quite as good as the previous two films I don't think it deserves some of the stick it gets, I mean what about Omen IV The Awakening (1991) for heavens sake? Anyway, the script by Andrew Birkin now has Damien the Antichrist as an adult who has to fend of killer priest's & the birth of the new Christ as well as continuing his quest to wipe out mankind. The one area where The Final Conflict disappoints is that it's not done on a grand enough scale, for a film that supposedly deals with the end of the World & ancient religious prophecy's it all feels very flat, empty & a bit too basic. For the majority of the film the script offers nothing more than a string of novelty supernatural set-piece deaths which are good to watch but they don't really drive the central story forward until the birth of the second Christ but even then this seems like just an excuse for more deaths & nothing significant becomes of it. Don't get me wrong because as a horror fan I love death, gore & mutilation but I must admit I expected something with a bit more resonance. The character's & dialogue are OK but apart from Damien they don't stand out, it moves along at a fair pace & has entertainment value although I did think it was a bit too long & the climax is a big let down.Director Baker does a decent job & the film has a nice basic but quite stylish look about it. There isn't much continuity between The Final Conflict & the other Omen films, for instance according to the original Omen the Antichrist Damien was born on the 6th June 1966 yet here The Final Conflict is set in 1982 & he is said to be 32 years old, not that it really matters though. There's a decent atmosphere although I can't say it's particularly scary or tension filled & that ending is very weak which really hurts the film as a whole because you are then stuck with negative feelings as the end credits roll despite what has gone before being alright. There's some good gore here including a burnt corpse & a great scene where someone gorily has their brains blown out (I then love how his leg twitches!) which is one of those cool film moment bits that is definitely worth watching on DVD & slow-motioning it.Technically The Final Conflict is well made & it obvious had a decent budget. Largely shot in England in London & Cornwall the scenery is nice enough although as a side note Fox hunting as shown in The Final Conflict has since been made illegal so you animal lovers out there needn't worry about such things anymore... The acting is OK but no one stood out apart from Sam Neill in his first starring role & he would obviously go on to achieve lots of success as an actor unlike anyone else in this film. I was surprised to see loud mouth TV show hostess for hire Ruby Wax had a small role in this film...The Final Conflict isn't the greatest film in the World that's for sure but it ain't too bad when all said & done, not the ideal way to round the trilogy off but it could have been worse. I'd say it's worth a watch if nothing else. Also known as Omen III The Final Conflict.

His mother, Katherine (Lee Remick), had been offed by the (literal) nanny from hell, Mrs. Baylock (a remarkable performance from Billie Whitelaw), while his ambassador father Robert (played with classy gravitas by the great Gregory Peck) had been killed by the cops while in the act of attempting to slay his adopted Satan spawn with one of the Daggers of Megiddo. By the conclusion of the film's sequel, 1978's Damien Omen II, the guardians of 12-year-old Damien also lay dead Uncle Richard (William Holden) had been knifed by wife Ann (Lee Grant), while Ann herself had perished in a conflagration. Viewers would have to wait another three years to see what deviltry young Damien would be up to next, but were well repaid for their patience when part three of the trilogy, The Final Conflict, was released in March 1981. The film performed only 1/3 as well at the box office as compared to the original Omen installment and does not seem to be highly regarded today, which surprises me. The picture certainly does up the ante of the previous two films, and while necessarily not as original or fresh in conception, more than makes up for that with some truly shocking developments.In the film, the viewer learns that Damien has graduated from both Yale and Oxford, is now in his early 30s and, as portrayed remarkably well by Sam Neill, is not only the supremely wealthy head of the Thorn business empire, but, in consequence of the Satanically induced suicide of the U.S. ambassador to Britain, is next in line for that august position as well. The film basically consists of two running, parallel plots. In the first, Father De Carlo (the great Italian actor Rossano Brazzi, giving the film's most likable performance), head of the San Benedetto monastery in Subiaco, Italy (which featured prominently in the original film), along with six select priests, each armed with one of the seven Daggers of Megiddo, go out into the world to slay the Antichrist. In the second, Damien searches throughout London to find the newly born Christ child, and to slay him before his own powers are greatly diminished. He is abetted by his personal assistant Harvey Dean (some nice work here by Don Gordon), whose own newly born son may or may not be the Christ child himself, while British investigative reporter Kate Reynolds (Lisa Harrow) interviews the new ambassador and learns a little too much about him. And so, a genuine conflict arises Can Damien kill the newborn Christ before the seven priests kill him?Unlike the previous two films, here, we have a Damien in full knowledge and acceptance of his Satanic lineage. For the first time, the Antichrist doesn't just slay the pesky meddlers surrounding him, but actively goes after Jesus Christ himself! THAT'S what I call upping the ante! As in the previous films, Damien's and his Pops' slayings make for memorable set pieces, and the deaths of the Subiaco priests are brought about most impressively (by fire, knifing, lightning, dog attack and so on). Surprisingly, however, these infernal homicides are not the film's most gripping scenes. Rather--at least, for this viewer--it is the pair of speeches that Damien makes that manages to impress the most. In the first, he addresses a Jesus crucifix with the most shockingly abusive language, calling Christianity a grubby, mundane creed, and declaring ...2,000 years have been enough...Nazarene charlatan, since the hour you vomited forth from a gaping wound of a woman you've done nothing but drown Man's soaring desires in a deluge of sanctimonious morality...I will drive deeper the thorns into your rancid carcass, you profaner of vices.... After which Damien Thorn, a genuine thorn in mankind's backside, does indeed drive the thorn crown on the Christ effigy deeper into Jesus' head, remarkably making the image cry bloody tears! It is a flabbergasting sequence, supremely well performed by Neill. And in his other great speech, Damien exhorts his heterogeneous minions to track down and slay the new Christ child with these words ...Slay the Nazarene, and you will know the violent raptures of my father's kingdom. Fail, and you will be condemned to a numbing eternity in the flaccid bosom of Christ. For the first time, thus, the viewer is witness to a genuinely evil Damien, one who is not only fully aware of his devilish ancestry, but reveling in it. The Final Conflict, besides showcasing some shocking violence and speechifying, is perhaps most startling in its willingness to feature infanticide as a subplot; indeed, by the film's end, no less than a dozen male infants have been exterminated throughout England in Damien's quest to eliminate the Christ child! Screenwriter Andrew Birkin's script certainly does not flinch from taking risks here, and he is ably complemented by some nice work from director Graham Barker and still another fine score from Jerry Goldsmith. Oh...and for all the gals out there who are attracted to so-called bad boys, in this film, they will get to see what a bout of lovemaking with the ultimate bad boy might be like. And for once, we have an Omen film that ends on a happy note--even Damien himself smiles as one of those blessed daggers plunges into his back! Damien may finally be vanquished here, but for those viewers who are interested in seeing what kind of mischief his demon daughter Delia is capable of spreading, there is always the TV sequel Omen IV The Awakening....

And he is fully aware of his unholy destiny as the Antichrist, the false prophet. He has carefully been studying the signs for Jesus Christ's return to Earth and has decided the time is near. He sends his disciples all across Great Britain when an alignment of stars signifies his birth to kill any baby boy born on the morning of March 24, between the hours of midnight and six o'clock. Even one of Damien's closest assistants son is not exempt from this decree.But Damien's human side is getting the better of him as he starts seeing the popular journalist Kate Reynolds and they begin a relationship. He also forms an attachment to her son Peter, whom Damien takes under his wing and manipulates for his own evil.While this is going on the seven daggers of Megiddo have been rediscovered from the rubble of the old Thorn Museum which was burnt down in the last film. They are bought out of an auction and are sent to the Monastery that Damien's father visited when he was investigating the truth behind his son. Seven priests led by Father DeCarlo go to Britain and resolve to finish what Robert Thorn and his brother Richard started by killing Damien and reassuring the second coming of the Messiah. The plot for Omen 3 has a lot going for it but there's a lot of things that could've been done that weren't even touched upon. The relationship between Kate and Damien could've been an emotional struggle to the story, since it could allude that Damien might achieve redemption due to their relationship. Even one of his associates say that Reynolds is dangerous to be around but Damien is resolute in his path and not even 'love' can affect him. The priests are underdeveloped as well. Six are killed off rather quickly and DeCarlo isn't as strong a protagonist as Robert or Richard Thorn. The once brilliant supernatural death scenes that The Omen series is famous for are sort of replaced by intentional murders and accidents. Some are still impressive but they lose the sense of demonic intervention that the other two films had. Instead it is either Damien showing off his power, or one of his disciples that commits a murder. There's not a lot of speculation in them in that they all don't look like they could be common accidents. However, the film does have its fair share of disturbing scenes. There's a scene where a woman sees a vision of her baby burnt. She then takes an iron and approaches the baby and the rest is left to our imagination. Another scene involves Damien on a hunt with a group of Beagles. Two priests ambush him and while he kill one of them off himself, he tells the pack to kill the other and they proceed to tear him apart. The acting in the film is also quite good. Sam Neill as Damien provides a dark and rather frightening performance for the now adult Antichrist and he does an excellent job throughout the movie. The rest of the cast perform their roles well but there's nothing that really stands out in the ensemble. Jerry Goldsmith provides us with another excellent score that builds up suspense and makes it clear that evil is at work. For all three movies his score remains as one of the best in the Horror genre.Overall The Final Conflict has a lot of problems but the film isn't entirely bad. It's worth watching to bring a conclusion to The Omen series but will probably leave a few fans wanting a better ending.

He wants to make sure that the resurrection never comes to be so he starts to have his goons kill all the male babies. As his power grows so does his ambitions of ruling the world. He likes to sit alone and talk to his father about his destiny. But in the end his empire collapses and Damien goes out with a whimper instead of a big bang.I was slightly disappointed by the way the trilogy ended. I new Damien had to go but I thought he would do it with his guns blazing. Oh well they should have left well enough alone because they tried to revive the series with a television movie sequel. That was a bad move on Fox's part. This coaster disc of a D.V.D. can be found in the box set. It's not worth watching. But this one is. It has some nice gory set pieces and Sam Neil's pretty convincing as the Prince of Darkness.Recommended for horror fans.

Now, this is obviously not some all time greatest movie of all time or anything like that, but it really is a well made film, and a good horror film. Considering that I only watch horror movies, and every review I've done on IMDb has been extremely negative of really horrible horror films (hence my name) this being the first positive review I've given is really saying something, at least for me anyway ) In The Final Conflict, our hero (or rather not I guess, since he IS the anti-Christ) Damien is all grown up and using his demonic ways to basically take over the world for Satan. The one melodramatic scene where he gives his little speech to his father Satan is pretty stupid and could have done without (although the scuptlure of Christ in that scnece is actually a pretty amazing work of art), but other than that this is a fine horror film. The atmosphere is great, decent performances. His scene with the president (played by Mason Adams) makes you chuckle and ties in so well how all politicians (as well as everything to do with politics) are so deeply in league with Satan.A couple shocking violent scenes, really creepy atmosphere, great cinematogrpahy - this film is clearly from an analogue age, before digital anything was in use. Perhaps this is part of the reason many don't like this movie, today's horror films are a lot easier to make due to digital advances (which is a good thing) so they appear to have high production quality, but are really terrible made, written and directed. The final conflict is well made, and of course the score by Jerry Goldsmith is excellent and adds much to the film, definitely would have been a worse movie without his score, I can't say enough how good it is. The mix of very old musical ideas with modern ones, (as well as a few tritones of course) really makes the movie in many ways for me.So see The Final Conflict if your a horror fan.

He is also very well aware of his goals and the means through which he must achieve them.Sam Neill is most dramatic in his role as Damien Thorn. He lends an almost Shakespearean air to his performance as the epitome of the antechristian heresy.This installment carries a bit more mysticism along with the dogma this time and makes for a much better enterprise.The movie industry's hype of this production indicated this would be a battle between Damien and god for control of the world. It implied that the USA would be destroyed once and for all in an all out battle between good and evil. Such was not the case.This story centers around Damien taking the position his father (Gregory Peck from the first movie) once held as American Ambassador to Britain and the priests who have found the holy daggers which can kill the Antichrist. If you don't expect what the hype offers, you won't be too disappointed in this movie. I wasn't disappointed at all. Sam Neill is wonderful in this presentation, although the end was a bit trite and way over christianized, but you really shouldn't expect anything more from a premise which is based in religiochristian myth.It rates a 6.9/10 from...the Fiend .

The meshing of the two sides of the story seen from both aspects is well blended.

The Final Conflict, the startling, compelling, and above all, well-made, conclusion to what should have only been the Omen trilogy, is almost as good as the original.As the tagline promises, ultimate evil now resides not in a child, but in a grown man. And while that idea sounds like a let-down compared to the owl-eyed coincidence of the character in the original film, it serves the purpose of a continuing story far better than having Damien as a boy of 12 and 13. It also provides a (semi) romantic subplot, and it means that the task of killing Damien has just become immensely more difficult.Taking up that holy job is the responsibility of a group of priests carrying Bugenhagen's seven knives, led by the ever-talented Rossano Brazzi. But there's another threat to the power of evil the Second Coming of Christ. And most of the movie deals with Damien's twisted attempts to find and dispatch the infant Jesus.The music, cinematography, visual quality, and dialogue are infinitely better than those of Damien, and even the grandiose moments dealing with Christ's rebirth are legitimately entertaining and make sense within the plot. It also allows for the main character to at last expose the true depths of his villainy, and make people talk about how Armageddon is really going to play out.Finally, what completely validates this as a great sequel for me is the ending, which I won't give away here. All I'll say is that, though highly controversial, it really pays off, and the series couldn't have ended any better.And it certainly didn't-- Omen IV The Awakening is too mind-bogglingly awful for words, and the 2006 remake of the original is just plain pathetic. There are only three true Omen movies, and only one sequel worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as the original-- The Final Conflict.

One of the small problems is the fact that this one doesn't seem to go anywhere while he just spends the entire time pontificating on his mission and journey without actually doing much of any interest. These scenes of him going around his office attempting to explain his plans using his connections with the Biblical passages back to his overall plans which aren't in the slightest bit interesting in the long run of simply being too overlong in the first half. The later parts here are almost as bad with the completely overblown love story and the concurrent plot to deal with the children that just tends to drag on for a while as the discussion of the events plods along with barely anything happening during these scenes. As this is understandable considering the particular storyline portrayed in here, this really tends to undermine the whole second half hat really just limps along lifelessly during this half while trying to make the valiant attempts of suspense and mortal terror but never doing anything to do that. That also leads into the last problem here in the film as it really does a pretty lousy job at really delving into his evil business as very little of what he does throughout the film actually manages to make the main characters who is supposedly the Devil incarnate come off like an ordinary psychopath with a devious plan. There's a few areas here that does come off rather nicely which mostly centers on the activities of the priests to stop his plans from coming to fruition which allows this one some rather creepy supernaturally-charged action scenes. The early thwarted ambush at the TV station is rather fun with the actual kill being the highlight, the assassination at the office works nicely with the surprise shock of it and the attempt on the hunting grounds is mostly memorable for turning one of the most beloved dog-breeds into vicious killers in a supposedly chilling scene only for the breed itself to make it amusingly cheesy. About the only other positive beyond these fun scenes is the rather nice way it goes about ensuring the Devilish identity of the main protagonist, holding over the events of the previous film playing off the more charming and level- headed characteristics that would be expected of someone like him which helps keep his identity a secret. Otherwise it's all that works here.Rated R Graphic Violence, Language, Brief Nudity, intense themes of child death and a shadowy sex scene.

Now this is how you make a sequel! The Final Conflict does just about everything right in building on franchise tropes and expectations and growing them to a newer, grander narrative. Damien is in full command of his power here, and it's exciting to see him at the helm rather than the omnipotent hand of Satan. Of course, he still has his minions and another Rottweiler helps him do his bidding, but seeing Damien at the head of Thorn Industries and how he worked his rise to power makes for a thrilling way to move the story forward. Neill is perfectly cast, injecting a combination of winning charm and darker torment behind his suits and smiles. Jerry Goldsmith is back once more for the score, and like with the story, he expands on his earlier work to provide a fuller, more diverse piece. Some of those angelic compositions near the end are show stopping.Omen III centres itself on an epic story where there are plenty of consequences at stake. We knew all along that Damien would rise to power, but now that he's got it, we don't know whether he'll get his ultimate goal of taking over the world. He has colleague entanglements, as he must kill the child of his assistant to rid the world of Christ, he has romantic complications with Kate, at one point disturbingly raping her in a bid to show how pain can be beautiful, and he ultimately has to face off against God himself. There's a lot more dramatic material there than there ever was in the Final Destination-like crux of the original two films. The vendetta the seven kamikaze priests vow against Damien also really puts the anti-Christ at risk, wherein the first two films his safety was always assured. Writer Andrew Birkin (most famous for his Peter Pan writings, of which you can certainly see lost boys aspects here) does a wonderful job of putting it all out on the table(laying it all on the alter?) for one truly thrilling battle for the ages.Not only is the story as sound as ever, but horror fans are really going to like the viciousness of the deaths throughout. With the seven vigilante monks going after Damien, and Damien himself killing off many others who stand in his way, the body count here is quite high, and like with the first two films, the producers don't hold back in staging an elaborate death scene. Since this had the films of the slasher era to compete with, the brutality of the carnage has been upped once more, and some of the deaths are quiet unsettling. The most notable being when the ambassador ties tape around the door knobs in his office, linking it all to his shotgun trigger, so when his colleagues enter his brains get splattered all over the presidential crest. Another sees a woman burn her infant son with a hot iron, and we memorably see the charred remains of the baby's face. One more, still, is when the first priest tries to kill Damien at a TV station, slipping up from the rafters and being dangled and burned in plastic as he melts in pain. The effects work is quite accomplished (done by A Clockwork Orange makeup artist Freddie Williamson), matching the menace of the acts themselves. Even the events that aren't gory still have a sinister quality to them, like when Damien, after killing an adversary at a fox hunt, rubs what he says to be fox blood on the face of a boy in initiation. With that and that uncomfortable rape scene, The Final Conflict certainly doesn't play it safe like a Hollywood movie should.A riveting thriller, through and grue, The Final Conflict certainly lives up to its title and offers Damien a fabulous final send off. The scope is so much larger than the first two films, and more than just a thriller it ends up becoming some grand theological statement of our times. It's pretty ballsy for a horror sequel to depict Christ on screen, but this one goes one further and gives us an ending so grand and fitting that it looks cut from Ben-Hur. As far as horror sequels go, the Omen III is certainly upper echelon. It's a shame it ended when it was just starting to hit its stride, but then again, given what would follow with the ill-advised fourth film, maybe they did good and quit while they were ahead. A must see! THE FINAL CONFLICT is quite an interesting film Damien grows up and the series ends on a satisfying note.

It's badly written, has loads of plot holes and insults anyone who really enjoyed the original film and its mythology. The lead performance by Sam Neill is great and there are some cool scenes, but it hardly matters since this such a letdown.Performances in Omen III are fine for the most part. Sam Neill is fantastic as Damien and gives a wonderfully charming performance. He really sells the fact that he is the Prince of Darkness. Rossano Brazzi and Lisa Harrow make up a decent protagonists and somebody to root for. The rest are just fine and doesn't leave much of an impression.The script is the major downfall of this film. It messes up the continuity, disregards established rules and creates more questions than provides any answers. While the plot is fairly simple and easy to follow but every minor detail and subplot just makes your head hurt. I could spend whole day naming all the plot holes. Its well directed and is an overall improvement in terms of visuals and execution over the previous installment, but Omen III problems are way too severe to ignore. Omen III is a terrible sequel that also is a great anti-climax. The ending is rushed and you feel cheated at the end. Is this what were building up for 3 films? Maybe there were production problems or too much studio interference or what ever. It's really sad to see a great premise with so much possibilities ruined by lousy sequels.For my money, Omen III is worth seeing if you want to finish up the trilogy or are a huge Sam Neill fan. If your looking for a movie from the early 80's I suggest watching Possession instead of this one. It's also horror but light years better than this one and has Isabelle Adjani having sex with octopus creature.

Actually, I watched the not-too-scary TV sequel Omen IVThe Awakening before watching this. The Final Conflict is the most disturbing of the series, for me. Although not as superb as the original, it isn't even as much accurate to the Bible as the first two were. Instead, the prophecy is much taken from the Apocrypha, a non-biblical book not much referred to by the catholic church. But still, it has some moments that are quite based on some Biblical prophecies in the Bible, or in much religious ideas. Like introducing the Antichrist as a government official, an ambassador. It has long been said that the Antichrist would take a form of a high official so as to gain control of the masses.And also the thing about the 2nd coming of the Savior.The Final Conflict was not a classic but still a very disturbing film, depicting events which could be true as it is written in the scriptures. Sam Niell makes an insidious 32-year old Damien Thorn,and British actress Lisa Harrow proves that even if she's not much famous, she can perform well and gets in to her character well.And she succeeds in that. She really is does what a reporter should be Smart and, a real Doubting Thomas.The film lacks the tension from the original, revealing instead a shocking effect to scare the audience. And some scenes are overdone. The merciless genocide of defenseless infants and the mild sex scene is overdone, even if it's just part of the story.Over all I said, this movie is strictly for those who can take it. That doesn't include controversial critics. If you're looking for a film that has a classic touch, then you're looking at the wrong film.

In this connection, beyond the drawing of a few logically plausible inferences, in conjunction with various questions of military strategy, it would be quite an ambitious leap to attempt a clinically psychological analysis of Satan. It's certainly beyond much real doubt that, having lost everything he'd been so abundantly handed, on a proverbial silver platter, he was, again, as Damien so passionately expressed it, in a bit of his own kind of agony; although, for all that, there were apparently no regrets, except for what only his enormous pride, as so well expressed by Milton, had blinded him to foreseeing&#151;namely, the inherent inevitability of his losing the War in Heaven he started. Thereafter, the thought of anything short of taking what he wanted by force had still been no less unbearably demeaning and compromising to him, particularly in the form of his having rather attempted to more honestly earn his rightful place, God's way; although, about as self-compromisingly albeit unavoidably, one can just about hear him, even now, putting his enormous rhetorical skills into action, once they'd been about all he'd had left, by way of personal defense; in his argument to the effect that it was God, and not he, who amounted to the real Tyrant! . . . Moreover, now that Satan has had about six-thousand years to no less incorrigibly continue inadvertently proving himself so categorically dead-wrong, one should not even need the prophecy, so graciously provided in advance, as to how utterly unbroken he shall prove to have been, even subsequent to a yet future one-thousand year period of confinement in the Bottomless Pit of Revelation 201-3!&#151;Which is undoubtedly one important reason, from among others too fascinatingly lengthy to delineate here, why God patterned the prophetic sequence of events in precisely this way, in answer to the logical question of at least a few, as to whether it would have done any good for even the Infinite Compassion of God to have provided some kind of savior, or whatever, even for him; that is, merely assuming, but only in the most academically insoluble sense, that such a thing would have been possible at all; or, at least, somehow provided for, under an alternatively-predetermined Plan, had the Lord foreseen such a fruitfully-redeeming necessity to have been the case. . . . However, either way, one can be certain that God takes no pleasure in having to forfeit any of His most magnificently angelic creations, just as He considered Satan to have been no less personally than symbolically, judicially, and even didactically more than worth the kind of six-thousand-year Trial of the Ages, at human expense, which is now about near its end. Of course, God had been sporting enough, in the process, to have given Adam the choice (as to whether each individual's morally free options would subsequently have to be decided on the easy road, rather than the hard one); one which could have rather resulted in Satan's having lost his wager, right on the spot, thereafter no longer to have been potentially useful for anything, either&#151;other than the Lake of Fire&#151;Revelation 2010! After-all, Adam's choice could not have been a real one, if this hadn't also constituted a correspondingly real possibility. But, alas, it didn't actually materialize, after-all! . . . Finally, there's no comparing the Fairest of Trials having been granted, by the alleged Tyrant, God, to Satan; with the kind of Trial Satan delivered to the Only Begotten Son of God, in return! Additionally, just about anybody worth everlastingly salvaging, by now, should have well-surpassed Satan's continuing level of denial; in his insistence that even democratically, capitalistically scientific competition, the kind which has allegedly synthesized the principle of universal selfishness with a system of lawful checks and balances which externally if not motivationally serve to prevent the unscrupulous victimization of anybody in the process, thus at least potentially opening the way for the individual self-actualization of all, is anything better than the inevitably, decisively unacceptable failure it is still very terminally proving itself to be. . . . And, to be sure, subsequent to his defeat at the Cross, Satan has been utilizing the only real strategy he has left; in that, for about two millennia now, he's been systematically masquerading as the only credible thing remaining (John 167-11), even to the most characteristically, morally-minded of atheists, namely, his Opponent, along with an array of remarkably-interlocking though contrastingly effective results! No Tyrant, after-all, could possibly have demonstrated His point (or, for that matter, Satan's, too) any more effectively, selflessly, expensively, indictingly, and, of course, no less redeemingly!&#151;Than had been accomplished at the Cross!--That is, the total antithesis of everything scientifically socialistic or altruistically hedonistic as well!--Although, for essentially the same reason, His was not the only Time of Jacob's Trouble, to the exclusion of still another, shortly to commence! . . . The Tragic Irony is that one doesn't have to tell ole Cool Hand Luke how compromising to God's Image Satan has inherently demonstrated himself to be, and what a brutally painful Failure to Communicate it's helped to foster; to the point where His Very Existence per se would appear the greatest of every Impossibility in which He claims to specialize, especially for one who's struggling as desperately as even Anthony Quinn's Barabbas to make Him compute! Howard Beale discovered, too, in a manner which didn't turn out to be very funny, after-all, about the kind of Court Jester to which God has been reduced; just as even His Clinically Bi-Polar Sense of Humor is perhaps the most Absurdly Bearable thing about Him, but only if there's really Nobody There to Thus Have to Blame, other than the most Easternly Wholistic or Pantheistically, Adventurously, Amorally, 'Self-Dismemberingly' Ever-Dreaming Culprit of Dostoyevsky's Notes from Underground!

Not as good as Omen I, but a heckuva lot better than Omen 2. There's some emotion here; there was none in Omen 2. Omen 2 was simply a let's keep killing people off while we search for an actual plot film. This production is a bit more elaborate. We see some emotion on the part of actor's portrayals. There's a definite plot.Now that's not to say that this is a top notch film. It seems as if in some scenes the director wanted to go further, but was hampered by the ratings system...probably for the good.Sam Neill has never been one of my favorites, but I always found him acceptable in various films. He was good here in his first big international role. At the time the film was released I remember thinking that he would go far...and he has done rather well.I found Lisa Harrow very good as the female lead. Apparently she and Neill were married (?).It was good seeing Rossano Brazzi, here as a priest, in one of his final films. He did well; seemed believable.If we could just leave out Omen 2 from the trilogy it would be much better, but then again it would be like leaving out a third of novel. Ah well, it is what it is.

He also controls a secret army of Satanists eager to carry out his demonic bidding.

But at least it was better than The Omen 4","Date":"7 April 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":" I'm not really what you'd consider a fan of these movies. The first one is a very atmospheric and suspenseful horror movie, 7/10. The second one was a decent sequel, nothing special - 6/10. Then there's this. I found it to be the weakest of the Damien trilogy I managed to find myself finding it decent.First of all Sam Neill has great screen presence as Damien. For a fact I'm still in the middle of deciding who's better - Sam Neill or Harvey Stephens. The other actors, I have mixed feelings on.The basic plot is that Damien has risen though the world of politics and gained a lot of followers. The Second Coming has happened and Damien uses his followers to kill every child born on the day that three stars collided. While all this is going on there are seven priests armed with the seven daggers to kill Damien.Now I did sort of like this one. I just thought that things could have been handled better. For example, Damien has this big room that he uses only to yell at Jesus. On the big screen and on paper this comes across as ridiculous to some viewers. For a fact when I was told about it I was laughing.So this is worth a watch at least in my opinion. It's at least better than The Omen 4, of which I hated. "},{"Title":"Marginally engaging Satanic thriller; enjoyable for its veering away from moulded formulae, prone to flak for the fact it's so ordinary.","Date":"23 January 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":" The Final Conflict arrives, and for its first third or so consequently develops, with a refreshing sense of change. Gone, during this time, is the framework often rife within the first two films of the series; films revolving around the life and times of an infant boy who happens to be the one that'll lead the world into oblivion on account of the fact he is the Antichrist. Back then, he was too young to really figure all that stuff out and the films were essentially about adults, or more specifically the boy's guardians, spending a good chunk of the feature trying to figure everything out before coming across the shocking revelation and then acting on it. They were, of course, foiled and thus we arrive at this third Omen movie with the young boy having grown up into a man foreplay revolving around this antiheroic creature causing mischief and generally coming to be at odds with the functioning Christian world around him gone, replaced only with a full on acknowledgement that destruction and religious new order is his calling.Alas, there is sadly a point wherein we realise the film appears all too keen to fall back into old habits. The fact Sam Neill is now playing once-whipper snapper Damien Thorn as a grown up, and that instead of engaging in trips to the zoo wherein the animals will bolt at the first sign him as parental figures strive to work it all out, we get a group of priests struggle against finding the character so as to foil him themselves. In doing so, they will need a collection of daggers that have been knocking around since the first film; daggers crucial in Damien's demise and the liberating of the world from his potential evils.The film will begin with the daggers and the merry journey they've undergone over the years via excavations and pawn shops. We're made aware of the daggers very early on; aware of their importance in that the finding and acquiring of them are detailed to us in a way that could only suggest they will play an important role later on. Meanwhile, Thorn is enjoying life as a prophet of the apocalypse under the guise of presidency for a company ironically specialising in the helping and aiding of people, what with its Soya produce and charitable policies. Director Graham Baker would probably like you to read into Thorn's role, running in tandem with precisely what it is Thorn is, as a sort of statement on conglomerancies as a whole &#x96; this one has The Devil running it, although the anti-capitalist statements about these companies being run by individuals out to enslave and rule the ignorant masses gets a little lost, in spite of the fact they're quite good fun to read into.Thorn is a charismatic man. We witness him dominate a television interview just prior to putting his abilities we first observed in the second film (wherein he reeled off a whole number of dates to his history teacher) when we watch him advise the President of the United States, no less, on a delicate foreign situation with a string of facts and figures. There are those, of course, who are out to thwart this character but Thorn's indomitable personality and position of such distinction makes it hard for the group of Vatican priests out to kill him look much more than a gang of religious kooks with a maddening murderous agenda. What is refreshing is that they know what they must do from the off the film one long conquest between these two sides of good and evil; not bogged down by what eventually got to be quite dull in the second film, as his step-father took an age to figure it all out before being granted the odd five minute burst at the end to act on it.With Damien striving to get those daggers himself, thus eliminating any threat of anyone turning the tables on him, and the priests tripping over themselves trying to eliminate the guy, the scene is set for an all out war complicated by a virtuous equivalent to Thorn due to be born in the near future (but wouldn't we all have to wait for him to be old enough to actually LEAD us in the war?) as well as journalist-come-love interest Kate Reynolds (Harrow) propping up proceedings. The film is an amiable failure, a film better than the often tedious second instalment and its procession of periodic creeping around as company takeover bids and grizzly episodic death sequences bogged down what was the continuation of a storyline detailing the impending end of the world. It's one thing to make the sorts of horror and content omnipresent within these films not frightening, another thing to make it all quite dull, but the second one managed it. This second sequel sidesteps said flaws, but is mired by that real lack of horror and hopelessness in its atmosphere often found throughout Donner's original. It's creepier than the second, but goofier than the first; a film with a sharp eye for carnage and what The Devil himself in human form might both do and say in his wry grins and swanning around with all this power, just do not expect an experience as Earth shattering as the nihilistic one threatening to doom all on planet Earth in the film.

Altogether I've noticed that I don't exactly fall in line when it comes to the first three films of The Omen. I really didn't like the first one, thought the second was ten times better, as for this one - well, in my personal humble non-professional opinion a new record had been set. The Omen 3 for me was the worst of them I've seen so far.While the dialogue-acting continued to improve, the physical-acting still required much work, probably on account of undeveloped cinematography. The story, while being dark and compelling, still felt too far fetched for me as a non-Christian. Altogether, the events, Damien's monologues, and in particular the ending - all felt like little more (pardon my rudeness) religious masturbation.And speaking of the ending - what the heck was that?! Were we really expected not to notice that it had absolutely nothing to do with the build up? If that was the way it was going to end - why go through the entire film preparing us for something that never happened?I don't know. It might just be me, but I think the only reason to watch The Omen III is to have another check-mark on the way to finishing the series.

Add to that the bunch of priests who want to turn Damien into a satanic pin-cushion and you've got an action packed spectacular of epic proportions, right?No.After a nifty gunshot to the face, The Final Conflict, just like the film before it, settles in for a languid trip to ho-hum-ville. Sam Neill is fine as Damien, but the priest attacks are pretty lame, the sub-plot about the Second Coming is barely exciting, and the grand finale in a ruined abbey has hardly got a pulse. Only the appearance of a fifty foot Bee-Gee at the end is any good. There's a couple of good scenes Damien rallying his acolytes for the big Herod-style massacre of the innocents, Damien apparently bumming his missus (he is the son of Satan after all!), and the aforementioned shotgun to the face bit, but there's an awful lot of nothing going on between all this. The Omen series must be one of the least interesting series out there. Final Conflict? Not much of a conflict at all, more like a 'slight scuffle'.

Greeting the assembled TV reporters, he told them he was not, in fact, announcing his resignation (the reason they thought they'd been invited) and after a speech pleading for his vindication, distributed manila envelopes containing, among other things, a suicide note to his wife and an organ donor card. Advising people to leave the room if this offends you, he withdrew a .357 Magnum from another envelope, warning Stay away - this thing will hurt someone. Amid shouts of protest, he quickly placed the gun against the roof of his mouth and pulled the trigger. As he slumped to the floor, his heart continued to pump blood through his nose and lips in thick, sticky streams. The entire footage was shown that night on WPVI-TV in Philadelphia, while middle-America sat down for meatloaf.An extreme case of life imitating art, the gruesome episode mirrors a pivotal scene from Omen III The Final Conflict, in which a hell-hypnotised American Ambassador to Britain (or England, according to the screenplay) rigs a rifle to his door handle, Heath Robinson-fashion, calls a press conference to his office, and before a gathering of hysterical journalists (and secretary Ruby Wax), redecorates his back wall with 'Neural Mist' by Dulux. In hindsight, it's one of the few believable elements in the entire shooting match. As lavishly scored and photographed as The Final Conflict is, the remainder's all but bound for Hell in a rickshaw.The final instalment in the Omen trilogy is such a god awful mess it's hard to know where to start, and it's not as if the set-up's exactly complicated. At 32, Damien Thorn (Sam Neill, looking every inch the bad weasel, but every inch the eye-rolling panto-villain in practicality) is chair of the Thorn Corporation, and now turns his wolfish gaze on the senate. Regular Omen watchers will have already gathered something's seriously amiss here Thorn plans to run in 1984, suggesting the film is set around 1982. But The Omen was set in 1976; the timeline has all but collapsed. Worryingly for Damien, there's a stork on the way according to prophecy, Jesus is to be born again, on 24th March on the Isle of Angels, in the body of a baby - as opposed to dropping out the skies, fully-formed, flaming scimitar in hand - only Hollywood would have the audacity to rewrite the Good Book. Also ranged against him are seven vigilante monks, led by Father DeCarlo (an hilariously-accented Brazzi), who plan to smooth Christ's landing by offing Damien with the seven daggers of Meggido. As we've gathered from the previous movies, the daggers must be thrust in cruciform pattern in the Antichrist's back, on consecrated ground, to ensure his elimination; yet flaunting the textbook, each killer hoodie is equipped with just one knife to dispatch him with.These monks (Sleepy, Dopey, Grumpy et al) are worse than absolutely useless in carrying out their mission. The first scales a studio gantry during a live TV interview and trips, turning himself into a charcoal briquette in the process and so leaving one to wonder how he proposed to carry out the stabbing in the first place - surely not by leaping 20ft onto the studio floor and breaking both ankles? Other monks wither pathetically before Thorn's twinkle-eyed gaze, rooted to the spot while Damien sets a pack of hunting hounds on them, or tricks them into mistaking their own number for the target.As if acknowledging his lack of evilness up to this point (this put-upon Antichrist buys flowers for his weedy henchman's expecting wife), Damien pulls a Herod-style stunt to halt the Nazarene's rebirth, ordering his 'Disciples of the Watch', including nurses, vicars and boy scouts, to kill all baby boys born at the appointed day and hour - rather undermining his position as president of the UN's Youth Council. We're later told every baby has been murdered - making a nonsense of the fact the one that counts has actually survived (this only makes sense in the novelisation, in which we learn the Christ child was born to gypsies, masking the usual paper-trails). The climax, in which a power-sapped Damien staggers through a ruined church calling for his rival - presumably armed with a blunt rattle and a sharpened rusk - to face him, is one of the most misjudged in cinema history. With Damien dead, at the hands of a literal back-stabbing journalist (who knew?), a 50ft Christ reveals himself fully-grown, bathed in the glow of mediocrity, to a pious choir. No cochlea-melting trumpets, no Stanley Spencer corpses hurling their coffin lids aside in Cookham - this Second Coming's one fat anti-climax.So what's the Good News? Well, Jerry Goldsmith's score and Meheux and Paynter's cinematography's certainly arresting, and the murders are indulgently gory. The opening, especially, in which the seven daggers are unearthed from the Thorn Museum and find their way into DeCarlo's hands, is a masterpiece of set-up, as the hunting scene is in editing. Damien's exhortations to his father (taken directly from JK Huysmans' novel 'Là-Bas') are just glorious, resembling Nietzsche in party mode, as Damien refers to Christ's grubby, mundane creed with its repellent dogma of original sin. All slightly undermined, unfortunately, by his promise that Satan will condemn the world to ...a brief recession.

Couldn't get enough of them.  But The Final Conflict falls a little short.  There are two reasons for this.  First is that in the original two movies the Antichrist is surrounded by legions of birds, dogs, nannies, stepmothers, etc. that always protect him.  This gives a really creepy edge to the proceedings as it feels like the devil's minions are everywhere.  In this film we see them gather for a while (how silly that a nurse would wear her uniform to a satanic gathering by the way)but there doesn't seem to be that many of them.  This episode concentrates too much on Damien and one evil figure isn't nearly as scary as a whole host of evil - even if he is supposed to be the Antichrist.  Second is the ending which everyone has talked about.  The thing that gets me is that Damien spouts Bible verses throughout the movie, the seven priests are constantly spewing verse, and neither side has figured out yet that christ wasn't supposed to come back as a baby.  It's pretty boring stuff for sure, but you'd think one of these guys would have read the Bible.  Remember that whole coming back with eyes of fire and double edged sword, blah, blah, blah thing.  It's pretty clear that's no baby.  So the big surprise at the end when everyone realizes that christ didn't come back as a baby isn't much of a surprise at all.  And if he didn't return as a baby why is he hiding while the Antichrist gets some baby killing done?  It's all so goofy.  I don't care if it matches up with the Bible, but it might as well match up with itself. How could nobody have known?  Too dumb to get into.  Still a slightly scary flick overall and worth seeing if you're into the other two.

None more spectacular than adult Damien at one point saying he wants to run for the Senate in 84.   Were the producers, director and writers so dense and stupid that they didn't realize that by saying that they were retroactively placing all the events of the first film in the 1950s?  (Gregory Peck's lapels and David Warner's hairstyle, not to mention the automobiles seemed pretty 70s to me!)  What's the big deal with these events in Israel and Egypt that are being talked about frequently yet have no relevance whatsoever to the final climax?   What happened to that child that Father DeCarlo says is now safe and what does it have to do with the climax?   How was Father Spiletto (the priest who saw the birth of Damien and arranged the adoption in the first film) able to confess to Father DeCarlo since we saw in The Omen that he was unable to speak and could only scribble random things with his left hand?  And does the ending truly represent the return of Christ and the final judgment of humanity?   Evidently not, since we were served up a TV movie a decade later that I don't think I'll waste my time seeing.    Watching Sam Neill recite his Satanic prayers evoked howls of laughter from me.    A far contrast to Billie Whitelaw's nanny in the original who truly seemed like a servant of Satan.    I guess perhaps the moral of the story is that its better to depict the anti-Christ as a child than as a man, where the whole sense of unanticipated terror about what the future will bring when he comes to power is still there.   Indeed, the terror of The Omen was in the fact that you could sense that the beginning of the end had arrived but the terror of what was still to come was still in your imagination to fear and worry about.   The Final Conflict, by tackling subject matter that I think is impossible to depict or envision in a credible fashion when the gimmick has already worn out after two previous movies, was in a sense doomed to fail from the outset, though perhaps if there had been some actors the stature of Peck or Holden this time out, the results would have been better.Stick to the first film and the second, and envision your own scenario of how it all resolved itself.   You'll scare yourself a lot more that way than this film ever will.

It's just one of those things. You may even love or hate 'Omen III The Final Conflict' (1981).I don't hate it, but it was clear that, by this stage of the 'Omen' series, ideas and enthusiasm were growing thin. 'The Omen' had the promise of this evil little child causing Armageddon and 'Damien' showed us how he cements the wealth and influence to do this. The failure of both Gregory Peck and William Holden (two box office idols) to exterminate the little brat was a great build up to what should have been a violent, memorable and, yet, graceful finale.'Omen III' largely ignores the events of its predecessor, except for brief glimpses of and references to the Thorn Corporation, Paul Buher and Damien's uncle. Instead, it attempts to retread the more successful road of 'The Omen', albeit placing Damien in Robert Thorn's role as US Ambassador to the Court of St. James as he climbs the political ladder in an effort to secure the Presidency of the United States of America.Trouble is, Damien shoots himself in the foot by feeding the suggestible current President (Mason Adams) false information on the sabotage of the Aswan Dam in Egypt -- implied to have actually been caused by Damien himself. Had Richard Donner directed the film, we might have got a great 'Superman'-style special effects sequence of the dam imploding and bringing Damien's style of chaos to Earth (and/or a more compelling story, one hopes!!). Instead, all we get are reams and reams of boring dialogue from a film that claims to be the most horrifying instalment of the 'Omen' series. And, after having been exposed as feeding the information to the President, Damien isn't even removed from office. After all, who would elect a Presidential adviser who got it all wrong, deliberately or not?The film even tries, in parts, to compete with 'Damien' in providing some pretty gory deaths but, at a push, all I can remember are the messy 'suicide' of the Ambassador preceding Damien, and Don Gordon getting an iron in the face! Each of which are instantly forgotten amongst the tangled plot. This is a shame, since the death scenes were highlights of the previous films and almost always memorable. The less said of the feeble attempts of a group of monks to assassinate Damien Thorn, the better!This failure would be acceptable if the story were compelling enough. Sam Neill as Damien and Lisa Harrow as his love interest and BBC journalist, Kate Reynolds try, kind of, to replicate the great romance that was actually quite a convincing part of 'The Omen'. But Damien is, quite frankly, just weird! And I doubt a woman apparently as intelligent as Kate would want to stick around him after being ass-raped by him and listening to him practically shouting at her that he is the Antichrist!!It is surprising to discover that the film's screenwriter, Andrew Birkin went on to write 'The Name of the Rose' (1984) and 'Perfume The Story of a Murderer' (2006), but this film's problem also obviously lies with the flat direction by Graham Baker, whilst renowned directors of photography, Phil Meheux and Robert Paynter probably provided whatever visual flair there is to be found. And even the Satanist cult is way off this time. Even though there are literally thousands of them, there's no one to challenge the awesome memory of Billie Whitelaw (or even the underused Robert Foxworth and Lance Henriksen of the previous film, for that matter).In the end, when you're about to doze off, things come to a head and, in one of the limpest and most predictable endings ever given to a horror film, Damien Thorn is suddenly dead. Even though the printed script stresses that Damien is on the brink of taking command of the world, there is nothing on the screen that translates that mood. However, as the 1991 sequel shows, they didn't use the Daggers of Megiddo properly and Twentieth-Century Fox, rather than Damien, will return to reap their revenge!A great performance by Sam Neill (who, apparently, has since disowned this early film of his); the consistently epic score from Jerry Goldsmith; a haunting opening sequence; the very, very occasional and instantly forgettable shock-factor about characters we care nothing about, and some intermittently nice and eerie location work are about all that save this film from being a complete waste of time!

Sam Neill is suitably creepy as an adult Damien, but he certainly couldn't overcome the frequently ridiculous dialogue he had to work with here.  I couldn't watch the scene in which he is ranting at a statue of Christ without grinning at how silly it was, which is definitely not a reaction I had to any scene in the original Omen.None of Omen films are intended to be taken too seriously, but the contradictions in this one are hard to overlook.  In the first film, Damien had to be stabbed with all seven sacred knives in a certain way, but by the time we get to The Final Conflict, any one of the seven will do.  And Damien's personal secretary/assistant is nothing like the apostles of Hell from the previous movies, who were totally devoted to Damien and were generally pretty menacing.  This character is about as scary as a teddy bear, and comes across like an average guy who just happens to be working for the Antichrist.  There is also some chat about seemingly important events taking place in Israel that I couldn't even figure out, and seemed to have nothing to do with anything else taking place in the movie.Perhaps a good ending could have redeemed The Final Conflict to some extent, but it is tremendously anticlimactic, a very disappointing way to end the triology.  In fact, if you're a big fan of The Omen (or even Damien Omen II), you will probably be irritated at how The Final Conflict limps to its conclusion.  Saving the world from Satan's last major offensive should be a little more interesting than this.

It is true that Damien has gotten less interesting as he got older, but as with the other two films; this stage of the Antichrist's life has its interesting twists and turns. Rather than simply focusing on the central characters this time round, Andrew Birkin's script takes in ideas of the rebirth of Christ, and given everything on display in this movie; it's clear that putting a script together wasn't an easy task. The film also features a sect that is against Damien, and as the Antichrist's powers have grown; he himself has decided to put together a coven of loyal worshippers, all of whom are more than willing to lay their lives down for his cause. The central plot idea takes form in Damien becoming the American Ambassador in Britain, a placement that allows him to put together his plan to murder all the baby boys born on the day of Christ's second coming; as one of them is said to be the son of God, and Damien's powers grow weaker all the time that he is alive!Sam Neill takes the lead role of The Antichrist himself, and given the two actors that went before him; he really does look the part. His acting is good too, as Neill convinces the audience that he really is dedicated to the cause as he continually professes that evil is a worthy cause. There isn't really a standout among the supporting cast, but it doesn't matter as Neill is clearly the star of the show. Oddly, given that this film was released in the eighties; a decade of trashy horror, the film features fewer and less graphic murder scenes than those seen in the first two films - and that brought it down for me as the grisly scenes in the first two movies provide many of the best bits. But even so; we've still got a man having his face burnt with an iron, and another smashing through a painted glass window; so all is not lost. The plot becomes a little wayward at times, and the film veers off a few times too often; but it's mostly entertaining and there's some nice religious themes thrown in. The ending is disappointing and doesn't fit with the tone of the series if you ask me; but to be honest I'm just pleased that this isn't a complete dead loss.

Establishing the presence of Evil itself in the person of Damien Thorn through two previous movies, the third installment lets the veiwer down in the characterization of Damien as an adult.  Sam Neill does a great job as the charismatic and darkly seductive political wunderkind, but, as with the script for DAMIEN OMEN II, the material isn't there to delve into the tormented soul of evil.THE FINAL CONFLICT attempts to be more in keeping with the original OMEN in terms of style and mood.  The film is informed by the very presence of England itself, complete with its overcast skies and its sweeping country landscape.  After the splash of colour that the second movie represented, the conclusion is wise in being serious as its original.  However, they just don't get serious enough.The build-up to the ultimate conflict between good and evil starts off well. The emergence of religious forces who are determined to stop the rise to power of the anti-Christ leads to Damien, who is poised for supreme world power as the head of the global Thorn empire. Unfortunately, what follows is a series of accidents that follow Damien and set out to be as grisly as possible.  THE OMEN series works well when it suggests rather than gratuitously shocks. This movie tries to shock the veiwer every chance it can get.There are some interesting moments - conversations of apocryphal prophecy between Damien and his loyal assistant/manservant; a nocturnal meeting on the mount between Damien and his legions of worshippers; a confrontation between Damien and the inverted Christ-statue he keeps in a secret shrine; the bizarre lovemaking between Damien and his love interest (played by the beautiful Lisa Harrow, whose resemblance to Lee Remick could have been played more upon to create an Oedipus-type complex in Damien).  The ending is a complete disappointment and rewrites the biblical prophecies that have been followed religiously through the first two films.Throughout the first films, Damien and the evil he represents grew  from a contained existence and more into the outer world.  The third installment should have depicted more of a larger-scale battle between Good and Evil, God and the Devil.  Although understandably a challenge to expect anyone to depict the Book of Revelations on-screen effectively, the third part of the OMEN series disappoints in that it avoids the fight instead of even trying to engage in it.Although it fails to live up to its built-up expectations, the movie is worthy to see, if only to see what isn't done that what is.

Maybe so, as the movie does have a few good sides, including the mostly good effort of J. Goldsmith. But a movie that quotes the bible repeatedly and attempts to show that the book's contents are all true and that it's just a matter of time until Jesus is born again and claims his kingdom is simply PATHETIC. Anyone who wants to watch a thriller/horror on the topic of the Antichrist/Satan would surely hope for more than this rubbish!!! Horrors are no place for Christian bigotry. The way Damien dies and Jesus is shown there in a halo of light... Give me a break! If you have yet to see the so-called third part of the trilogy and you appreciate the first two movies,then avoid this or, at least, be prepared to feel disgusted. I was. And still am.

Aside from Jerry Goldsmith's score, I can't think of anything this film does well. The script is just awful, the characters you couldn't give a monkeys about, and tacking on that pathetic ending as if it were some ingenious twist that Christ won't return as a babe - well it just won't wash. It's a long time since I've been this disappointed with a film. Why'd they give it to a pleb like Baker? A chimp could have made a better fist of this. Absolute unadulterated tripe!!!

At least this third part brings back some of the original film's stylishness as well as the shocking brutality of Damien Thorn's character. Damien was an insufferable teenagers in part two, but as an adult, played here by Sam Neill, the son of Satan once again is a devilishly charismatic and mysterious figure. At the fairly young age of 32, Damien is already the head of the world's largest corporation and his evil powers even arrange for him to become the American ambassador in Great Britain. His main duty now is to prevent the Second Coming of Christ by annihilating all the baby-boys born on March 24rd , and the only persons able to stop him are a group of monks who dispose of the seven holy Meggido daggers. Admittedly, the plot sometimes gets a little over-ambitious and can't cover up some major holes, yet there are a handful of powerfully staged sequences that widely make up for this and the set pieces are thoroughly impressive. Particularly the masterfully choreographed scene in which our beloved Antichrist encourages hundreds of people, among which young boys and elderly folks, to kill for him is very atmospheric and quite petrifying. The Final Conflict also contains several compelling, albeit underdeveloped sub plots, such as the hierarchy of the Monks and Damien's obscure sexual influence on his girlfriend and news reporter Kate. The murders, mostly supernaturally inflicted ones, are effectively grisly and raw. The gunshot suicide near the beginning of the film ranks among the vilest death sequences in 80's horror cinema. Unfortunately what you've read before in other reviews already is true the ending is a severe letdown and pretty much ruins all the positive style & substance elements that were so carefully built up. ** Additional Spoiler Warning ** This is no way for the Antichrist to come to his end! Those who were, like me, preparing themselves for the ultimate confrontation between good and evil will be dreadfully disappointed and maybe even upset.

Omen III, 1981) is a considerable step down from Damien Omen II (1978), which is a step down from The Omen (1976). Sam Neill's performance is embarrassingly bad. Neill's dialogue is atrocious, and it's magnified in its obnoxiousness by his feigned American accent--which is strange, because the boy who played Damien in part II clearly had an English accent (his fictional father having been an ambassador in England). So why was Neill prohibited from speaking with an English accent? The result is laughable, as Neill tries to recite evil lines as the Antichrist. His evil scowls are also quite ridiculous. However the greatest detriment to this movie is that it has no epic grandeur. You would think that the battle between God and the Antichrist would be epic in scope, but The Final Conflict seems much more like rival gangs fighting over a piece of turf. Who cares? Although the script hinted at interesting ideas, I'm sure that the writers simply did not know enough about Christianity to make the movie persuasive. The climax of the film is also rather ordinary, as Damien dies by having a dagger thrust in his back. You mean that's all it takes to kill the Antichrist? Heck, Dracula and Frankenstein are a lot scarier than this guy!

Having re-watched and enjoyed Omen 1 and 2, from which the combination of Jerry Goldsmiths score and creepy camera work left me pretty disturbed, I was looking forward to the third and final instalment which I hadn't seen before.What a massive disappointment.This film is a complete and total waste of so many good talents.Sam Neill is pretty good as Damian Thorne. Sly, authoritative when necessary and pretty twisted in certain scenes. Check out the first scene in his satanic chapel as a perfect example of how the character should be played. Excellently done.The problem here is that the basic premise of the Omen films has been thrown out of the window. I'll admit the writers here did have a challenge. They had to fulfil the prophecy elements stated in the earlier versions and somehow tie all that together with some sort of satisfying conclusion.So many story points are present but have no bearing on the rest of the plot. Damian becomes the US ambassador to the UK like his (adopted) father before him. This seems to have been required in the story because it's stated in the earlier films that he will rise through the world of politics. Damian also becomes the head of the UN's children's program and this point is given a fair amount of attention at the beginning of the film but once again this comes to nothing in the story.The prior two films set this story up and it's quite clear to me how the story was intended to progress. Why on earth didn't they follow this? The story as intended by Damian Omen 2 should run as follows...Damian as head of Thorn Industries has bought up huge amounts of the worlds agricultural land and holds power over food distribution creating famine wherever he pleases. It's through this that he is able to bring the world into conflict and bring about the end of days.Once again this plot point is mentioned at the beginning of the 3rd film but nothing ever comes of it. Such a frustrating waste.The staple of The Omen films is the bizarre, random (sometimes overly complex) death scenes to those characters who threaten the antichrists ascension but once again this core element of the films is abandoned. This was the coolest signature of the films inspiring a feeling of dread in the viewer. You know they're screwed but you don't know when it's coming. The idea was taken forward by the Final Destination films with good effect. That's the fun part... and unfortunately it's missing.Instead we have Rotweilers with hypo abilities (seen in the first film when the nanny hangs herself) and this is massively overused. The whole thing feels like a particularly bad episode of tales of the unexpected.There is also a bizarre scene where Damian addresses his followers. The location is never disclosed and the followers appear to be a collection of Monty Python caricatures. Perhaps the most silly of these are the two boy scouts...I found myself laughing out loud at some of the supposedly terrifying death scenes (especially the one at the BBC which is so silly you can't help but laugh).In my opinion this film needs to be re-made to service the overall story with the ending it deserves. I want to watch each of the various strands of Damian Thorn's devilish plans slot into place perfectly as age of Satan draws closer by his design. Whether he fails or succeeds is irrelevant... We deserved a better ending than this!

Of course, the presumptions about the Anti-Christ and his actions are ridiculous any how, but at least there were some spooky scenes and interesting story lines in Omen I and II. Add a number of strange freak accidents and chilling Gregorian chants and you have some rather efficient scary movies.In The Final Conflict, all of these things are weakened to the point of stupidity. The plot is messy and cheap, the killing scenes are laughable and even the music by Goldsmith is lame compared to its prequels. The scene in which Damien addresses a crowd of wannabee baby killers is so stupid that it must have created some very red faces on the original creators.

To begin with, Damien was fourteen in the the second Omen film, released (and set) in 1978. Three years later, he's thirty-two. How did that happen? Secondly, the film relies far too heavily on shock tactics for any kind of impact. After the early scene of the British Ambassador blowing his brains out in loving, graphic detail after being given the evil eye by a dog(!), we get an anal rape, a string of baby killings (one of which is carried out by boy scouts!), a fox hunting sequence which is, in itself, extremely offensive, and a woman who firstly burns her baby to death with a hot iron and then slams the thing into her husband's face. To top it all, the ending is so anti-climactic as to be insulting. Life's just too short to waste on this kind of heavy-handed, amateurish trash. Do yourself one big favour and watch the Gregory Peck / Lee Remick original again. Come to think of it, even the 'Damien' episode of SOUTH PARK is a million times more interesting and inventive than this tiresome would-be horror.

The characters are flat and unemotional, the plot is vague - did we miss a movie here? - and overall everything is just extraordinarily mediocre. Half the time it's like the Satanic version of the god damn Looney Tunes, what with how those priests set up traps to try and catch Damien. That first sequence with the guy falling off the rafters was bordering on comical, and the rest are not much better.

Basically the anti-Christ Damien Thorn (Sam Neill) has grown up to become CEO of a huge multinational corporation and the new ambassador for Great Britain (Scotland, England & Wales). Of course he is aware of his heritage, and wants to achieve his father's goal to control the world, while meanwhile those also aware of his existence on Earth get ready to go against him. In an auction the seven sacred daggers (you may remember from the first film) as the only way to kill Damien have been recovered, and a seven monks have taken one each to kill him. As Damien has the threat of death coming into his ears, he wants both these seven monks killed and knives disposed, and more imminently the first recently born boy eliminated. Damien is convinced the Christ is due for a Second Coming, and towards the end he finds out is is true when he meets his fate from one of the last daggers in a church, good triumphs in the end. Also starring Rossano Brazzi as Father DeCarlo, Don Gordon as Harvey Dean, Lisa Harrow as Kate Reynolds, Barnaby Holm as Peter Reynolds, Mason Adams as President, Robert Arden as American Ambassador, Leueen Willoughby as Barbara Dean and Worzel Gummidge's Norman Bird. The casting of Neill isn't really that significant or interesting, the story is pretty boring, the death count is much lower, and the ending is like the critics say silly, I didn't pay much attention to every part of it to be honest, so a silly horror sequel. Adequate! "}]
