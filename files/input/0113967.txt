[{"Title":"New Jersey Drive keeps it real.","Date":"7 November 1998","Score":"11 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama","Review":"  I just wanted to inform anyone who may be interested that the the movie New Jersey Drive was my personal favorite off alltime. I admire the work Nick Gomez and Spike Lee put into this masterpiece of a movie. This movie made quite an impression on me because of its realness and its appreciation of detail of life in urban New Jersey. It struck a chord with me, personally, because I grew up with friends like those depicted in the movie. It further made an impression with me because I used to spend time in Teaneck several years ago, so some of the characters were kept real. At times, this movie seemed like a documentary because you didn't know whether or not these were real events taking place. Although movies like Boys in the Hood and Menace II Society grab more attention, I personally feel these movies were somewhat enhanced to appeal to a broader audience. New Jersey Drive was an uncompromising piece of in your face reality. Lee and Gomez covered every detail in this urban drama from the music, clothing, slang, and location.Unlike some of the movies I mentioned earlier, the actors performed as if they weren't actors. Nothing was compromised in order to make good theater. The only misfortune to come from this movie was the fact that many people slept on it. I look forward to more works of art from Nick and Spike in the hopefully near future.

I have friends from New York and New Jersey and this film represents the kind of lifestyle that still exists today in lower income area's outside of the Big City lifestyle.  If you have not seen this movie and ever wondered what REALLY goes on in the urban jungle, check this movie out.  No really big name actors, its as if they just pulled these guys off the street and said act, which adds to the realism of the movie, the performances are FANTASTIC none the less!  SEE THIS FILM!

The film's us vs. the law mentality is underscored by the all-black neighborhood vs. the nearly all-white police force. Here the cops are so bad they seem like caricatures and in one scene they even ambush the boys as they drive by in a car they've just liberated from its owner. It's like a bushwhacking from an old Western, but the contemporary setting makes it look all too real.The story centers on young Jason Petty and his buddies, to whom school is just an inconvenience that takes time away from their real occupation of boosting cars. This happens to be Newark, N.J., a rust-belt city low on jobs but notoriously high on crime. In fact the problem is so severe that the cops all have Car Theft written on their backs, to show that an entire unit must be devoted to this particular crime.The boys use a slim Jim to gleefully break into cars and go joy-riding, as if it's no big deal. They only run into real trouble when the police ambush them. The vicious, Nazi-like Lt. has a vendetta against the boys, seeing them not as human beings who might be worthy of redemption, but as human targets. In fact, he's a little reminiscent of that sadistic Nazi officer of the Warsaw ghetto, who shot down Jews for pleasure in the film Schindler's List. When the boys steal a police car in retribution for the ambush, things predictably go downhill fast. They are severely beaten by the cops and Jason finally ends up in prison. Clearly these are bad boys, who'd steal your car in a minute, but the film wants us to see them as anti-heroes, showing Jason protecting his sister and his friend taking care of his own grandmother. The film left us wondering whose side to take and who to feel sadder for the boys whose lives are going down the drain, the honest citizens whose cars are being stolen left and right and who could be caught in the crossfire of a shootout at any moment or the city of Newark itself, the spirit of whose law is being betrayed by brutal, soul-dead cops.In spite of the over-the-top portrayal of the latter, the film offers a realistic-looking rendering of the ghetto, of the protagonists and their families and of the culture of car theft in a city where there appears to be only 2 career paths - law enforcement and crime. Strangely, the entire subject of drugs is never mentioned.The filmmakers (including producer Spike Lee) are obviously biased against the Newark police, who, we hope, are not as bad they are portrayed here. Nevertheless, they've given us yet another a strong, affecting story about the inner city and black youth gone awry and Sharron Corley is fine as Jason.

As it's supposed to in urban movies, the street atmosphere was definitely there.  The script was good because it showed a crrosroad as Jason's crew and the cops lives crossed paths, I don't wanna give this away though. Sharron Corley gives a good performance as the humble but tough Jason, as does Gabriel Casseus as the knucklehead Midget and Don Faison as Tiny Dime, etc., etc.  It was also wonderfully directed by Nick Gomez and also stars Heavy D and Michele Morgan.authentic street movie 10/10 "},{"Title":"Memory Lane","Date":"25 April 2009","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama","Review":" I lived in that area (Hoboken and Jersey City)for about ten years. This film certainly captures the feel of that time and place. The dialogue is very good, the music is right and scenarios realistic. As another poster said, it looks almost like a documentary.I like the way it humanizes these kids, who probably would have rather have been born in Westchester, but fall into what kids fall into. It just so happens that area is pretty rough.They over-demonize the cops quite a bit, but that's to be expected. I'd say the acting is good all-around, too.It gives the viewer some sense of how this idiocy is caused and gets blown out-of-proportion. Hopefully, the new mayor of Newark is making progress.

It's the most realistic I've seen on urban youth. The actors were great. I will look out for more films by Gomez. I had never heard of the film until someone mentioned it recently. I bought it on DVD. I was impressed. I haven't seen anything come close to life as I know it in Philadelphia. This comes real close - in fact, one scene where there is an accident (I won't spoil and give details), reminded me of a nearly identical situation in Philadelphia. At first I thought Gomez took the scene from that real-life event, but then I realized that he made the film a few years before that situation. I also agree with the point that this film didn't try to broaden its appeal by putting in Hollywood crap. Gomez also directed Laws of Gravity - I am eager to see it.

Car theft and joyriding is a thrilling experience for many teens as they courageously face the mean streets while trying to survive and overcome many obstacles. The story begins by introducing us to Jason Petty, a tough yet decent teen who, like many of his friends, gets his kicks out of stealing cars and having fun. As he tells the story from his point of view, Jason exposes us to how he and most of his friends deal with the unfortunate, every day occurrences in their neighborhood. From gun violence to police corruption to juvenile detention and the death of close friends, there is nothing positive for these kids to look forward to. The acting is incredibly believable if not downright brilliant. Since the film is set in the New Jersey ghetto, the urban vernacular and the overall dialogue is truly fantastic. The cast includes Sharron Corley, Gabriel Casseus, Donald Faison of Scrubs and a cameo appearance of the late hip hop artist Heavy D.333 "},{"Title":"Classic...","Date":"24 March 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama","Review":" Great movie, one of the best i ever seen period...It's raw, gritty, and takes you inside the movie and makes you feel that you're actually there. It's true to life feel is what i think really made the movie. Going to high school during the late nineties era i could definitely relate to a lot that was going on in these young boys life. I too had friends like these but never took the route that they did. The movie is so perfect and so on point it's like everything was meant to be the way that it went. Each character was believable, the music went with the setting, the fashion fits the era and the slang and everything else feel in line with the movie as well. I guess because of the somewhat similar experience i had in high school with my friends really plays a role on why i love the movie so much; when you relate to something it grabs your attention a little more. But overall this is easily one of the most slept on movies of all time, not just hood movie but movie period. It never got bored and kept you wanting more (ooh and the soundtrack is on point as well). If you haven't check this movie out do so, if anyone wants to know what it was like to be young, black, lost and living in the mid to late nineties check this movie out as it perfectly depicts it. I would love to see a reunion of the characters in the movie to see where they're at now with their lives. Lastly r.i.p. Heavy D. he almost single handedly stole the movie with his one line.

It's about The lives of a group of Newark New Jersey urban youth. Newark New Jersey is the car theft capital of the world. (at least the US) Fun fact. Newark alone has more car thefts than LA and NYC put together. That's where the Drive in the title comes from. Anyways, it's a lot like other movies of this period. Ala Juice ..Boys in the Hood. The main difference with this film though is the social message and Density of the characters. Jason..played by Sharron Corley is very good in this. I must say though that Gabriel Casseus who plays midget Takes this movie to another level. He's so good in this. It's no mystery he's a good actor but in this he's amazing. I don't wanna give away too much of the story but basically Jason and Midget get caught up with the world of Car Theft and corrupt cops etc...Although they are criminals, u feel compassion for WHY they do what they do. The cop they call Roscoe is a menace. U actually FEEL for Jason and Midget. It by non means glorifies street life at all. There's one scene that kinda sums up the attitude of a lot of Urban Youth of that time. ( Myself included) Its the scene where Midget gets chased by the cops and they make him empty is beer out. He later returns to the same beer after the beat down by the dopes to finish it lol I think Next to Clockers and Fresh this is my fav  Hood movie. ( Menace to Society and American Me are close behind this) "}{"Title":"New jersey drive little insight","Date":"25 March 2011","Score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama","Review":" This movie is a good over cap of what happened in Newark.

In fact Mayor James refused to have any footage of the movie shot within Newark city limits taking away a good part of the movies authenticity!The movie starts with a carjacking gone bad that ends up putting one of the carjackers Ronnie Lambs, Koran C. Thomas,in the hospital on life support. Lambs and his fellow carjackers unknowingly carjacked tough take no BS Newark cop Emil Rosco's, Saul Stein, car. It was Officer Rosco who just happened to be on the scene when Ronnie and his friends were ambushed in a police string. Shot four times by Rosco Ronnie now in the hospital and no gun found on him has Rosco in deep trouble with the only witness to the shooting fellow carjacker Jason Petty, Shannon Corley, slated to testify against him before the grand jury!This all sets the stage for Rosco hounding Jason all throughout the movie to get him to change his testimony. As for Jason he gives Rosco and the Newark Police all the rope they need to hang him by continuously going out with his friends carjacking cars thus putting his and their lives as well as freedom in jeopardy. Jason's mom Rene Petty, Gwen McGee, knows that her son is out stealing cars instead of going to school but try as she does Rene can't convince him that he'll end up either dead or behind bars as a result of his actions. It's later when his straight as an arrow sister Jackie, Samantha Brown, starts to hang out with the same crowd that Jason does that he throws a fit that almost has him gunned down by her new found Gangsta boyfriend Ritchie, Andre Moore. Ritchie feels that Jason dists him by trying to keep Jackie from ending up like him Out of luck out of work out of school and nothing in life to look forward too! Stealing cars together with his friend Midget, Gabe Casseus, Jason tries to make a few bucks for his troubles by selling them to this chop-chop junk yard operator, Arthur J. Nascarella, in what looks like the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn for pennies on the dollar. Despite all the business they give him the junk yard man almost throws Midget out of his place when he comes unannounced with his latest steal not wanting the cops to connect him, by buying stolen merchandise, to Midgets & Jason's criminal activities! it's later when the law finally catches up with Jason that ends with one of his many carjacking friends being gunned down that he finally realizes that this life is not for him. ****SPOILERS**** Spending 90 days behind bars in a juvenile dentition center Jason finally saw the light and decided to go back to school and put his life of crime behind him. The fact that Officer Rosco was indited in the Ronnie Lambs shooting helps also in Jason now not having to worry about Rosco framing or working him over, which he did a number of time in the movie, to keep him from talking. It was in fact Midget's fiery death is a stolen car chased by police that finally convinced Jason that he was right in his decision to go straight! It was Jasons refusal to join Midget and his friends in this latest carjacking caper that ended up saving his life!
