From the script and the fabulous acting you can tell that there is a history behind all of the feelings that there are. You understand why the characters take certain actions and why the do not make others. You can feel sympathy and joy and love and sorrow for them all at once. You see humanity at its best AND at it's worst. You can relate to the characters because although you may have never been in their exact situations before you see qualities and downfalls in them that you see in yourself. To a certain extent this movie kind of keeps you wondering but then at the end it explains itself and you feel a certain peace and understanding not only in you but for the characters. I will say that I have have never EVER cried so much in my life nor have gotten so much out of something. I implore you to watch this movie and take it's meaning to heart.

As depressing the subject matter was, it was a refreshing change of pace instead of being blindsided with the revelation about a character's fatal illness 2/3 into the movie (Love Story Terms of Endearment, etc.). Meryl Streep, Renee Zellweger and William Hurt give very strong performances that don't go over the edge. The characters they play seem human; they're not perfect people. (Arguably, one might not say that about the Martha Stewart-type character Streep plays but throughout the film, I found her character to be noble in a non-sappy way. She's dealing with her plight the best way she knows how.) One True Thing is an observant, unsentimental family drama in which the tears at the end were well-earned.

Everything about it is superb. While it may appear to be a film which mainly appeals to women, I think that the men should give it a chance too - a substantial part of the storyline is from George Gulden's (William Hurt) point of view, as the father of the family.Through 'One True Thing', we see how a family copes with disease - from everybody's point of view. Although we follow the story from Ellen Gulden's (Renee Zellweger) eyes, it never feels like we're missing out on anything.The strongest point of the film is the superb acting. Hurt and Zellweger give very strong, convincing performances, and the supporting cast are also very good; however, it's Meryl Streep who stands out here. I truly believe this to be not only one of her best performances to date, but one of the best ever. Her work in this film is absolutely astounding. She's everything and anything the film could require from her - and then so much more. What she brings to this role is truly magical; the woman is a genius.

It opens with Rene Zeleweger discussing her mother's death with the District Attorney; sparing us the cheap cinematic shots of a shocking illness and death. From there it proceeds into a look at a family system, in which everyone plays by a set of unexamined rules, and uses the mother's cancer to show what happens when all the rules change. William Hurt as the self-important father, and Meryl Streep as the Suzy Homemaker mother are both superb; nuanced and not what they appear to be. Zeleweger is seething, angry and surprised with herself. Tom Everett Scott doesn't have much to do, but he does it well.The story is predictable, and takes at least one badly soppy turn it needn't have taken, but the performances, and the view of family as a place where anger and love are equally mixed, make it worthwhile.

Those are not the words I would have chosen - not by a long shot. I would choose a word like sombre, sometimes even depressing. Which isn't to say that it's a bad movie. It's actually a pretty good movie, featuring good performances from the leads, with enough uncertainty throughout about what's going to happen at the end that you keep watching. The uncertainty comes from the structure of the movie - it seems to revolve around Ellen's reminiscences of her mother's slow death from cancer, as she is interviewed by the DA. So, we know from the start that something suspicious happened at the end - the questions are what? and who? Renee Zellweger was very good as Ellen - the somewhat resentful daughter who has to give up her life and job in New York to return home to care for her sick mother. Ellen evolves through the movie - moreso than any other character - as she learns to deal with both the strengths and weaknesses of her parents. Her relationship with her father (William Hurt) is quite interesting. My initial impression was that they were quite close, but the warts in the relationship start to show after a while. Hurt was effective as the detached husband - detached not in an uncaring way, but in the sense of being unable to cope with what's happening to his wife, and seeking escape from it in various ways. Finally, Meryl Streep as the cancer-stricken Kate was very convincing in the role, seeking to live out what remains of her life in the most fulfilling way possible, then dealing with the anger she feels at her increasing debilitation. In a way, watching a family deal with this kind of crisis reminded me a little bit of Ordinary People, although this movie was far less emotionally intense. So, not uplifting and humorous (with all due respect to whoever wrote the synopsis on the DVD jacket) but very good in its own way. 7/10 "},{"Title":"The story takes a very realistic view on the illness of a parent.

Ellen is angry the beginning of the movie, but as time passes she ends up understanding her mothers' life time dedication to her family.  She even asks her mom How do you do his, every day, in and out and nobody notices it? That is what women do, a lot of what I call invisible work.

The more we learn of Kate and her character, the more we love her and her strengths.  The same can be said about Ellen, Zellweger's role as daughter who has postponed fast track career to come home to be with Streep as Kate faces crippling and debilitating illness.  Their relation ship at movie beginning is strained to say the least. Going into the theater I was mentally prepared for a very deep and emotional roller coaster ride.  A slow start with character development was actually to the movie's benefit.  In terms of personal growth, the main characters, except for Streep, were not the same people by movies end.  We came to learn them as they learned about themselves.  Zellweger and Hurt appear one dimensional, both focused on their writing and careers, with daughter idolizing father.  Streep the same as a mother content with home making. But as the movie continues to unfold, we get to see all of these characters as real; their strengths and weaknesses both.  Ellen's childhood flashback illustrate happy moments of only father at first, but as time goes on, she relives the same flashbacks and notes her mother's subtle, supportive role. All are challenged to assess their lives in the face of certain death of Streep, whose role as matriarch continues to impress as the tale is told. She was the 'light' of the film, as Hurt confesses.  The bedroom conversation between mother and daughter is exceptional, when secrets are revealed and the realization that potential dreams are left unfulfilled.  I doubt there was a dry eye in the house at this point.  Follow that up with the New Year's Eve scene, a funny breath of fresh air at a difficult and emotional part of the movie. The movie was very good with very good performance by Hurt, Streep and Zellweger.  I wouldn't call it the movie of the year, but consideration should go to Streep and Zellweger for nominations.  Hurt lends his expected strong presence to both roles, and makes both characters all the better. Give it an 8 out of 10.

Such is the case of ONE TRUE THING.  I lost both my mother and sister to cancer and had the agonizing experience of watching them both deteriorate before the end came. Meryl Streep gives the greatest performance of her life as Kate Gulden, whose life has been totally dedicated to giving herself sacrificially to her family.  Now, as this debilitating illness overtakes her, she can't accept the fact her family now has to take care of her.  Yet, it is only in this transfer of power that her family comes to know and appreciate just how strong she really is. How Ms. Streep was overlooked by the Academy is beyond me.  Perhaps it is, as another has said, we just take her great talent for granted.  To watch her character change through the progression of her illness and the resulting chemotherapy was astounding to watch.  She is truly one of the greatest actresses ever to grace the screen. Renee Zellweger is convincing as the daughter who is forced to come back home to care for her dying mother, who she has never been close to.  It is a traumatic experience to, once you have worked so hard to earn your independence, have to return home to live with your parents again.  Even Ellen Gulden is not aware of the family values that have been instilled in her by her mother but, although naturally rebellious at the thought, she is willing to give up her promising career as a writer for a New York magazine to take on this responsibility because It's the right thing to do.  This character trait is revealed again later in Ellen's pursuit of a hot story that could make her career--the expose of a Senator and former classmate at Harvard whose political career is in jeopardy because of a variety of indiscretions.  Ellen gets the interview, but lacks the killer instinct to pull it off, knowing her article would ruin not only his career but his family as well. Renee turns in a really sensitive performance.  Her comedic genius comes through as well in the scene where she attempts to make a luncheon for her mother's ladies' club meeting and nearly sets the kitchen on fire.  For some reason, the women barely touch their lunch, but they are still so impressed by her efforts, they make her an honorary Minnie.  It is then Ellen's greatest fears are realized; she is starting to feel trapped in the very world she tried so hard to escape. William Hurt is the father and husband, George Gulden, literary professor at the local university, winner of the American Book Award.  He is an intellectual giant whose acquaintances include some of the great authors of the day.  He does not understand his wife's housekeeping and ladies' club lifestyle, but finds it a convenience to him and a complement to his own career.  In literary circles, George is a master of words, but in communicating to his family, he suffers inflammation of the sentence structure and hardening of the paragraph.  George was Ellen's idol when she was growing up, but now, as an adult, she sees his vulnerabilities and cannot accept them.  Ellen's entire work ethic was motivated by her dad, now he has become, in her eyes, weak and helpless in a time of crisis. ONE TRUE THING is a story of how a family, so diverse yet so much alike, can be drawn together by tragedy.  In the end, they all learn to accept each other as they really are--flaws and all.  The film and the characters all come across as very real and, yes I cried even though I'm a guy.  Anna Quindlen's story is very moving and thought-provoking. The music in the film really helps to set the mood, the score by Cliff Eidelman, and a very beautiful rendition of Silent Night by the Morrow Memorial United Methodist Church Choir of Maplewood, New Jersey (the film was shot in and around areas of New Jersey, not in Langhorne, Pennsylvania). There is also a terrific song by Bette Midler, One True Friend, sung over the ending credits.  Some of those who leave a movie as soon as the last scene fades and don't stay for the credits don't know what they miss. Unfortunately, neither of these two songs are on the soundtrack CD.  It could have been the greatest soundtrack of all time and they blew it. Bette's song is on her CD Bathhouse Betty for all you Midler fans who might be wondering. Nevertheless, ONE TRUE THING has become one of my all-time favorite movies.

I am not necessarily stating that the film is uplifting, because it isn't. In fact, the movie is down right depressing. I am trying to say that it takes a lot for a movie to generate emotional tears from an attending crowd.I cried in One True Thing, enough to conclude that this is one of the most emotionally powerful movies   of 1998. The characters were perfectly casted. The performances are all guaranteed Oscar Nominees, especially Meryl Streep, who portraits the dying Kate extremely well. Her acting alone was enough to make the movie excel to the point of recommendation, and gives you a new point of view at her. I also thought that Renée Zellweger portrayed a realistic single, free-wheeling woman who has to take care of their own mother. The other cast members including William Hurt & Tom Everett Scott, were also superb. The script of this movie was really fantastic. It is kind of funny how the movie's concept has to do with the controversial happenings in my local area. You see, I live near Lansing, Michigan, and right now a big issue here is assistant suicide doctor Jack Kavorkian's  (excuse my miss-spelling if so) ways have  just been outlawed. The public will vote on this according to their beliefs in November After watching One True Thing it really changed my perspective at this topic, although I have always believed in it. Without revealing the ending of the film I will simply say that suicide is a distant theme in this movie and I think it fits in accurately with the gorgeous story. Overall, this movie does indeed have more emotional  impact than Titanic, Saving Private Ryan or any other tearjerker released in the last few years. I think that is because the main idea of this movie is that this kind of thing happened every day, so it relates better to an audience. And indeed, that this could happening to you.

But none quite as radiant and loving as she does in this outstanding family drama. In fact, I wouldn't have thought this a part for Streep at all (this is Susan Sarandon territory). Streep is the total wife and mother to her English professor husband, and published author (William Hurt), and two adult children who have come home to celebrate their father's 55th birthday. I remember liking this movie a lot when it was first released in theaters. I found a copy of the DVD and bought it and last night watched it. I had an entirely different appreciation for Anna Quinlan's richly observed story of a family in crisis as the result of the mother's suffering from a harrowing illness. This is not a spoiler. You know the mother has cancer from the very first frame. My recollection was that Streep was playing a tightly controlled Martha Stewart-type domestic perfectionist and of course, watching it the second time, I realized nothing could be further from the truth. At first you are lulled into thinking this might be the case. She throws a costume birthday party for her husband and seems ridiculous dressed as an aging Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz, complete with ruby red slippers and a toy Toto. When her daughter, played by Renee Zelwegger is in the kitchen with her mother, she finds herself corrected constantly but only because her daughter has rejected her mother's domesticity and in the family home, she is a stranger in a strange land--inept and uninterested. The day after the party, we learn that Streep's character is being kept in the hospital for surgery, and suddenly Dad is insisting that his daughter take leave from her job as a reporter for New York Magazine, and stay home to take care of her ailing mother. Bristling with resentment, she obeys her beloved father's demands, but this sets up the stage for many shifting changes in the family dynamic. Tellingly, the daughter says at upfront that she was never close to her mother, and was the perfect Daddy's little girl. She emulated her father to the point where she also became a writer, and looks to him for approval, which he is rather stingy with and often with backhanded criticisms. Meanwhile, the daughter takes on the chores of running the household while taking on the duties of ministering to her mother. She makes lunch for her mother's club, The Minnie's, a group of the town's women who do lots of beautifying and other civic chores. She arrogantly assumes, it's not big deal to cook, but can't cook a lick and the badly prepared meal lays on the plates, mostly untouched. But her mother's praise for her daughter's effort is genuine and laced with love. As Daddy's feet of clay become more brittle, the mother's non-judgmental behavior and warmth and appreciation for her daughter begins to open the younger woman's eyes to the reality of her parent's marriage. Daddy's probable infidelities, his vanity, his literary snobbishness and willingness to kiss ass of a visiting writer he idolizes, show him to be less of a hero in his daughter's eyes. Worse, she see that he does nothing in the house to help make his wife more comfortable, and he increasingly stays away as her condition deteriorates. The daughter's resentment builds to confrontation that leaves her confused and more angry. There's a telling scene near the end of the movie when Streep confronts her daughter about her anger at her father. It is in this beautifully staged scene with Streep and Zelwegger playing superbly together, that the mother reveals to her daughter that she knows everything her daughter knows about her father. She has made her accommodations because that is what you do in a long marriage. She neither asks for her daughter's sympathy, or the audience's indulgence. She's not one of those embarrassed politician's wives who have been humiliated in public and then made to feel shame for sticking it out. She has created a loving home for her family. The mother in this film simply plays her part--as does her husband in this relationship. Streep is absolutely at her subtle best here, never never sacrificing the dignity of this dying woman. There could have been plenty of opportunity to go for the emotionally-charged big moment, but Streep refuses to ask us to feel sorry for her. She is totally in the moment of this character's situation and she's utterly fabulous. Zelwegger, an often outstanding screen actress who has become a bit mannered and fussy in her recent roles, shows how this character has matured through grief and anger, and as she begins to see just how great a mother she's always had, we share those revelations. William Hurt doesn't flinch from this unlikeable character, and the final revelation is cathartic. He's never been my favorite actor, often taking on roles that are hard to like. But his work is rich in characterization and he never overplays or reaches for a cheap emotional payoff either. The role of the brother is not very detailed here, nor is Zellweger rather caddish boyfriend. It was nice to see the young Lauren Graham, playing Zellweger's best friend--her delightful Lorelai Gilmore persona in chrysalis. In many ways, ONE TRUE THING is a throwback--an absorbing family drama full of words and emotions, a throwback to the era of the woman's pictures of the 30s and 40s. The three main characters never lose their focus. A very fine movie, well worth your time.

These terms are only general. The strength of One True Thing lies in the way the actors elevate their characters above Hollywood cliché territory.Streep is Kate, the perfect homemaker whose ability to light up a room with her charm is evident in her opening scenes at a costume party celebrating Hurt's birthday. But Ellen has never been close to her mother, and since she graduated from Harvard University, has a certain destain about her- Ellen almost thinks her mother is a simplistic air-head. While on the other hand, she admires her father- who shares a special passion Writing. Ellen writes for an aggressive New York firm, and is almost heartbroken when her latest piece is torn down by Hurt, who seems to be a very lonely figure.To get to the point, as Kate gets sicker, Ellen's perspectives change and she grows closer to her mother and more distant to her father. Hurt keeps making excuses not to be there when the family needs him most, and Ellen assumes he's having an affair. Meanwhile she's given up her desk at work to spend time doing craft activities with her mother's cult group The Minnies, and also learning that her mother isn't as weak as she first assumed.Without giving too much away, One True Thing is a masterpiece in character study. Streep once again turns in a beautiful performance, this time working on a subtle level that starts slow but ends with a brilliant speech on the vows of marriage. Streep earned her eleventh Oscar nomination for this performance. Hurt is also convincing as the father who carries a secret that isn't revealed until the closing moments. But it is Renee Zellweger who steals this movie. Forget Chicago, Cold Mountain, Bridget Jones's Diary or whatever else you've seen her do and rent this movie. She is remarkable in it.

But this screenplay doesn't give men a chance and the title, if nothing else, appears to refer to the fact that you can depend on women, but not on men.For all the men portrayed in the film are failures in one way or another from Zellweger's employer, who mistakes a request to attend to her sick mother as a bid for a promotion, to her brother who is a Harvard drop-out, to her boyfriend who forever seems perplexed when faced with Miss Zellweger's far-richer repertoire of emotions.I suspect that this movie will strike a chord with women who find themselves in an unhappy marriage, or who have separated from a husband for it stereotypes the women as strong and ready to make sacrifices and the men weak, selfish and opportunistic.Meryl Streep's and Renee Zellweger's performances carry this somewhat ponderous movie that runs its course gracefully through the seasons in New England to its rather downbeat conclusion, and while William Hurt is called upon to be shallow, he does this well in what is an undemanding role for him.

The storyline is basically this; a young, driven career woman is called home by her father to care for her aling mother, who has been stricken by cancer.  Meryl Streep, who I normally cant stand, delivers a DEAD ON performance of a woman dealing with cancer.  I personally lived this story back in '97 (my then wife survived, and remains cancer free to this day) and her performance was 100% accurate to what I personally witnessed.William Hurt plays the father, who seems unable to cope with the fact his wife is dying.

I think what stands out about Zellweger's performance is that it isn't movie-real...it's real-life real. I've seen her in some other flicks and she was good, but here she was stupendous.In terms of the other actors, William Hurt turns in a fine performance as the husband. Tom Everett Scott is fine as the son/brother, as is Nicky Katt as the boyfriend.This is what I generally refer to as an absorbing drama. A mother has cancer. Her husband, a college professor, convinces the daughter to come home from her job as a magazine feature writer in New York City, while the father doesn't fulfill his own responsibilities. The daughter is left to be nurse maid and run the house, while dad simply goes about his everyday life...including having flings with a few students (although this is mostly implied). The mother eventually succumbs, with an autopsy showing the cause of death as an overdose of morpheme. Throughout the film a detective is questioning -- though not accusing -- the daughter about the events leading up to the death. However, this is not a mystery. The detective is just a means by the author/director to tell the story of the life the family was experiencing. This is heart warming in spots, incredibly sad in spots, and just life in other spots...in other words, real life.Highly recommended for the serious film-goer.

So off we went.Unlike a lot of men, I don't mind a good sorrowful, thought provoking, dramatic movie.  What does get under my skin is one that is sobby, blatantly obvious, and melodramatic.  Surprisingly, this movie falls under the former category.  I have secretly enjoyed several Streep performances over the years, starting with her moving turn as the divorcee of Dustin Hoffman in Kramer vs. Kramer.  Further, Sophie's Choice was simply incredible. Though Streep does not reach these levels in One True Thing, she comes close.  Aided by the superb William Hurt, subtle and sublime as always, and Zellweger, who, taking a page from Hurt, seems to do more with her actions and expressions than with words, Streep shines as the perky Mom suddenly blasted by cancer.  Anyone with even a semi-close relationship with their mother will feel a twinge in their soul as they see Streep's decline from mother-for-all-neighborhood-kids to a helpless woman struggling with intense pain while trying to maintain dignity. You'll give your own Mom a slightly tighter hug the next time you see her.Technical criticism  Shame on the State of New York!!

It is extraordinary that the most important professional characteristic of the American actor is his or her physical appearance, both for lead and support or character roles. As a result, few of them have much of a range. British leads are not necessarily beautiful, yet a homely appearance does not stop many of them from turning in stunning performances in a wide variety of roles.Meryl Streep, who stars as the mother dying from cancer in this movie, has legendary status in America for playing a raft of different characters and accents (we'll forgive her Lindy Chamberlain imitation in Evil Angels which merely proved that an Australian accent sounds very like London Cockney to an outsider). If she were a British actor her ability to do this ie be an actor would pass unremarked. Yet across the Atlantic she has freak status.That said, La Meryl as Mum is the best thing in this otherwise unremarkable two hankie melodrama. The story is seen through the eyes of her daughter, Ellen (Renee Zellweger) apparently an ambitious magazine reporter though she has the demeanour of a college freshman.  She is closer to her Dad, an upstate New York college professor of American literature. She has never wanted to be like her mother, the wife and mother type who puts all her considerable energies into hearth, home and local affairs. It emerges though that Dad is no saint, and surprise, surprise, Mum knows it. Dad is also something of a phony. His love of literature is genuine but his own creativity is confined to lying about his whereabouts. Mum, on the other hand, is the genuine article, warm, loving unselfish, good fun and not stupid, even if she does first appear in fancy dress as an outsize Dorothy from Kansas, complete with red shoes.I found Ellen's character an obstacle to liking this movie. She is persuaded (ordered?) by her father to interrupt her career and come home and look after Mum, who doesn't really want her to). So naturally she is pretty petulant. But it's almost as if Mum is dying to spite her, which of course she is not. Ellen, in her mid-twenties, seems to regress to being a disgruntled teenager. She seems angry at Mum for having the nerve to die on her. Mum, on the other hand is anxious not to be a burden.William Hurt plays Dad as a seedy, rather repressed and inarticulate man (the literary quips are usually someone else's) who is having the usual mid-life crisis. His wife's illness makes his situation almost unbearable. But the greatest blow is his discovery that his precious novel has made no impact on a famous Harvard contemporary (Oliver Most) who comes to dinner. There's also a brother who wisely if selfishly takes himself off towards the end.At the end of the day, it is Mum who lodges in the memory, her sad decline offset against her earlier vitality. Meryl plays her just right, and I'm sure she'd do the same if a cockney accent were called for.

As Meryl's character, Kate, gets sicker the family's problems are unravelled.Meryl Streep is an exceptional actress and her emotional range in this movie is amazing to see. She goes from a fun-loving, outgoing mother to a more withdrawn and frightened but strong character through out this film's journey. Though the film does focus on Ellen, Kate's daughter, the performances by all the main and supporting actors are very strong. This has remained a top favourite of mine since i saw about 9 years ago.

Renee Zellweger plays an ambitious journalist who, under pressure from her college professor father (William Hurt), finds herself having to juggle her career while nursing her terminally ill mother (Meryl Streep). Zellweger's character initially feels she is living under her brilliant father's shadow and considers her mother to be shallow, and looks down upon her community activities with her like-minded middle-aged friends. Of course these attitudes are destined to change. Forced to care for her mother Zellweger founds herself effectively forced to live her mother's life, accompanying her on her Good Samaritan duties at first until the unspecified cancer develops and she must assume all domestic duties.Although, as I wrote earlier, the story isn't particularly original, the study of these three main characters &#x96; the fourth family member, Zellweger's younger brother, is pretty much shunted to the sidelines &#x96; is quite well written. We learn about Zellweger's parents as she does mother has hidden depths the daughter never suspected, while the father she has for so long tried to emulate reveals a hidden shallowness that opens her eyes to the misconceptions under which she has laboured. The only thing that bothered me about the script was its occasional tendency to make its point in the most obvious ways Hurt asks Zellweger to write an introduction for his forthcoming book of essays then immediately asks her to wash his shirts, for example; on another occasion, when Zellweger tells her doctor her mother doesn't need a nurse because her mother can confide in her the doctor pointedly asks 'Can she?' Considering the number of subtle ways in which the script succeeds in other respects, these weaknesses are both surprising and obvious.It's probably the father's character that undergoes the biggest test, mainly because he attempts to carry on his life as normal while his wife is dying and the mental pressures these place upon him are too immense to conceal for any length of time. Forced to face up to the reality of the situation the script allows us to believe that he has become a better person, able to accept his limitations. William Hurt gives a typically accomplished performance in the role, as does Meryl Streep as the mother. While the film is told from Zellweger's viewpoint, it's these two who get all the best scenes The film does tend to become a series of emotional speeches and set-pieces in the final couple of reels, with each character going through their own revelatory moment. The parents learn from the child (and from each other) as the child has learned from the parents, and the dignity of life, however shallow or bedevilled by secret doubts it might be, is reinforced. If you're one of those people who blubs easily at films make sure you have a box of man-size tissues close to hand because you're going to need them, and even if you pride yourself on remaining dry-eyed during scenes of high emotion be prepared to swallow the lump in your throat every now and then.

Meryl Streep gives one of her most outstanding performances as Kate Gulden, the dying wife of a National Book Award-winning professor of English George Gulden (William Hurt) and uber mother of Ellen (Renee Zellweger) and Brian (Tom Everett Scott). The story is from the viewpoint of Ellen, who must bear the brunt of caring for her mother (and father) while coming to terms with the father she once adored.Renee Zellweger gives a great performance as the ambitious magazine writer torn between her desire to advance her career, and her father's need for her to care for her mother as her death approaches. William Hurt does a great job playing the self-absorbed academic who tries to keep his life going as smoothly as when his wife was well.This movie offers an very real portrayal of the forces and dynamics that shape the relationships of a family and community during a time of hardship and ending.

The script is particular is filled with great dialogue and amazing characters that you really care about. The story itself is a little cheesy and doesn't always hold water but it is none the less good and is defiantly good enough. The direction is quite good but not the strongest point of the film but works just like the story does. The visual effects are very good for a drama like this.

Despite receiving an undeserving Best Actress Nomination, Meryl Streep did not give the best performance in this film. Neither did William Hurt. The best performance belongs to Renee Zellwegger. Renee Zellwegger is easily one of the best working actresses today. She totally immerses herself into the character of Ellen and does an excellent. She should have been nominated instead of Meryl Streep, who received a nomination pretty much because of her name only. Its easy to understand why Meryl Streep was nominated, she plays a woman suffering from cancer (the academy loves that). However, if Meryl deserved a nomination it should have been a best supporting actress nod instead. Its not that Meryl does a bad job, she does a solid job but nothing spectacular. The same thing with William Hurt. The movie itself is flawed. One True Thing is structured in a weird way. Its presented as flashbacks when Ellen is being asked questions. This seems unnecessary and somewhat damages the flow of the film. The film is also a bit predictable. However, I still recommend One True Thing.

What I really liked about this film was that it seemed to be about real people and real situations, rather than something that is so unbelievable that the viewer thinks it could never happen. I suppose it has an element of truth in its story telling and visual style that many films seem to be lacking. Probably not the best film to watch if you want to wind down, but if your after something with some emotional depth and thought then maybe this film might serve a purpose.

It's not that she didn't do a fine job (she WAS incredible)...but hers is actually a supporting role in the story of her daughter.  Not only does Renee Zellweger have more screen time than Streep, but Zellweger's character grows and changes through the course of the story in ways that Streep's does not.  (Streep's performance is not a matter of character development so much as revealing existing but hidden aspects of the character.)

My mother was seriously ill when it was released and passed away shortly thereafter, and I knew I couldn't handle it emotionally until some time had passed.  Now I'm glad I did see it, and really appreciate the message it gives us.There are awkward moments in the beginning before the story really is set in motion, and I don't feel the framing device with the D.A. works all that well, but these problems are more than compensated for by what does work well.  Carl Franklin is to be congratulated for his excellent job of direction, and also the producers and studio for having the insight to select him to direct, as I'm sure he would not have been a lot of people's first choice!I have always found Meryl Streep a difficult actress to warm up to - technically brilliant, yes, but I find something about her chilly and offputting, with certain exceptions of course, like Sophie's Choice.  Well, she demolishes those reservations here with her stunning, deeply felt work.  If another actress, who didn't already have a zillion  nominations like Ms. Streep, had given this performance she would have waltzed off with the Oscar. William Hurt also does wonderfully well with his best role in years.  Renee Zellweger has some problems with her role (I'd say notably an unsuccessful drunk scene) but makes a sincere and serious effort and succeeds more often than she fails.

"},{"Title":"Solid performances, depressing movie","Date":"15 May 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  Renée Zellweger, in a definite departure from Jerry McGuire's ever faithful love interest, plays a newspaper journalist with high ambition and a deep-rooted need to gain her literary father's acceptance.  Streep plays the somewhat flighty mother that Zellweger never understood while growing up, and even looked down on, until Zellweger is asked by her father to nurse her mother newly diagnosed with cancer.  From here Zellweger takes a familiar journey to a greater understanding and appreciation of her mother and something of an estrangement from her father as she realizes his inherent egotism.  The plot interweaves a few interesting sub-plots and themes, such as a brother whose academic life fails to meet his father's expectations, and a brief foray into the realm of assisted suicide, but on the whole retains the offspring/parent discovery plot.  Perhaps the nicest twist in this story is the exploration of a mother/daughter relationship.  Tom Hanks and Jackie Gleason in Nothing in Common, and Ted Danson and Jack Lemmon in Dad are just two of a slew of father/son movies that explore this same theme, but One True Thing has a definite more tender edge, although somewhat distant and cold.Kudos to Karen Croner for writing characters that seem closer to real life than most tear jerkers.  While it takes some time to begin empathizing with any of these somewhat distant characters, they are people you know.  These are not caricatures, there is no one bad guy whose every move is malicious and there is no good guy whose every thought is self-sacrificing.  These are people with foibles and problems and vices and times of weakness. Every character has a dark side and the audience understands that.Of course Meryl Streep shines again, as she does in all her roles.  This time she is completely believable as a mother dying of cancer.  She is warm, human, and never has a false moment.  William Hurt plays a regular William Hurt character-a man so caught up in his own world that he fails to recognize what is around him (a la Broadcast News The Accidental Tourist The Big Chill The Doctor etc.) and completely believable, as well. Renée Zellweger plays a daughter extremely well, and has magnificent scenes with Streep and Hurt, although you never quite buy that she's really a reporter.  She nails the humanity but somehow misses the ambition.In all, the cast pulls together wonderfully and completely engrosses you in the process.  Again, the characters are all distant to us in the beginning, never knowing who to really identify with in the first few minutes.  While many will point to this as an inherent weakness, this is what makes this movie real to me.  We must settle in with these characters.  They are not us, but we know them and it just takes some time to understand where they're coming from.  In this, the discovery is worth the investment.

I do admit this movie had an adequate enough plot; after all a daughter moving back home to take care of her mother is quite alright.  Renee Zelwegger, Meryl Streep, William Hurt, and Tom Everett Scott star in a film that was supposed to be one of the heart and togetherness. Instead, I saw a mother who relied on her daughter for everything, a father that was stubborn and wanted to see things done his way, a daughter who had a life of her own, and a brother who is off doing his own thing in college. This is definitely a well meaning movie with a plot that I can tell needs definite work. It also brings together a fine group of actors. The one thing I would add is the development of family coming together and rally around each other for support as their mother's condition worstened. If there was one part in the whole film that I really liked it was the interview with the district attorney; my opinion was that if the director just had this in the film instead of the acting portion, I could get a mental picture of what she was saying very easily. I can only give this film a weak, marginal thumbs up for this film because it is like reading a severely undeveloped essay that has good ideas but no real thought to it.

I may be wrong, but anyway, it's actually a very simple movie; nothing too special about it.  The flashback method they used wasn't very effective.   Also, what I've noticed about the film is that whenever a really good thing has happened, it'll be followed immediately by something bad.  It sometimes tries too hard for your sympathy.

Karen Croner's screenplay, on the other hand, emphasized the fact that the daughter learns not to take her mother for granted, and I have to say that disappointed me a little.  Not just because it reduced the part that involved me in the novel, but because this is how tear-jerkers are born.However, director Carl Franklin and the actors still make this a great movie.  Part of the reason is we still see the effects of cancer, unlike many other dying movies where the actor's vanity, or maybe the studio's, prevents it.  Streep also isn't afraid to show the psychological effects of cancer, either.  We also see the family dynamic explored very well, so instead of a simplistic Gee mom was right after all feeling, we see how Ellen, the daughter, struggles under the weight of her father while neglecting her mother, and learns that her mother did pass some qualities on to her.Zellweger and Streep are both outstanding, refusing to go for easy pathos, which is another trap of tear-jerker movies.  The overlooked(and most essential) performance of the movie, however, is William Hurt as the father. I can't believe they originally wanted Nick Nolte (a fine actor) for this movie, because Hurt is so perfect as the academic who obviously loves both his wife and daughter but cuts himself off from them because he can't quite express himself there.  The character here is actually more fleshed out than in the book, because we see some of his ambitions thwarted.

What is  the One True Thing?.  A clever use of the  inquisition of Ellen (Zellweger), by the  Assistant D.A., allows the audience to  move back and forth through time with a  fluidness not often accomplished this  successfully. She is not actually accused  of a crime, but the questioning takes us  along as she comes to understand a mother  who, at times, has been her adversary and  always a contradiction. During the course of the movie a wonderful transition takes place as this daughter  finds her way in a family where things are not, at all, as they seem. Very believable dialog and subtle acting,  take us, along with Ellen, as the plot  twists and turns. Don't expect to foresee what is going to  happen before you enter the theatre;  neither be surprised if, after you leave  the theatre, you are still asking is  there One True Thing or was it there all  along.

In that space we can come together and really love each other for what's good in each of us and despite what's not so good.  That's the thing that really counts.As others have said here, the performances were the best part of the film. The framing device of Renee Zellweger's character telling her story to the District Attorney didn't really work.  Some of the relationships seemed underdeveloped.  There should have been more of  the son, and either more (or less) the best friend.  Still, the film definitely transcends the 'disease of the week' genre into which some might categorize it.  It isn't sentimental or schmaltzy.  Much of that is because of the tension in the family relationships here on display.William Hurt isn't scared to play a really flawed person without trying to necessarily redeem him.  Zellweger's discovery that he's not quite the hero she thought and her subsequent anger because of this gives the film an edge it might not have had if this was the story of a less complicated happy family.  But guess what?  Most of us are dysfunctional, and that's what makes us human.  The writer and the director subtly bring these things forward.Renee Zellweger, with her sweet face, takes a little while to make herself believable as the outwardly tough Ellen, but ultimately hers is a really thoughtful, moving performance.  You can really see her character growing up.  During the worst of circumstances, Ellen learns who her parents are as people, not as the images of the brilliant intellectual father and the fluffy suburban mum she's always seen.As usual, Meryl Streep is magic.  That almost sounds unfair, like she's always the same in everything.  But Kate Gulden is really different to any character she's played before.  She really makes this woman a fully realized human being, showing us sides of the character that Kate's children, her friends, maybe even she herself never knew she had.Kate appears at first to be a kind of Martha Stewart/Suzy Homemaker perfectionist who is nevertheless a kind and sweet woman.  And Streep's portrayal gives us the sense that before her illness, essentially Kate was that.  But through her insightful performance, we learn that perhaps that image was what she put out for others to see, maybe even as a coping mechanism to gloss over those parts of her life that she was unsatisfied with.Director Carl Franklin really shows restraint in this film.  It's definitely a tear jerker, but it doesn't manipulate the viewer with a sugar sweet picture of a dying woman and her family.  Instead, One True Thing shows us what this situation might really be like, and invites the viewer to empathize.  The Christmas scene at the town square with the singing of Silent Night is maybe the saddest but strangely also the most uplifting moment of the film.As the outward trappings that made up the Gulden family as they saw themselves fall away during Kate's illness and death, they learn about the nature of love.  It isn't always easy or pretty or deserved.  It isn't even always a choice that we make.  Love just IS, and will carry us on even after those we love have gone.

A couple with two children, both studying, the lady very well but the boy doing someething different of what his father wants from him, the mother as a housewife happy organizing parties and other social activities and also aware of what his husband beside his work is doing. She felt sick with cancer, and she does not want to be helped, she wants to work and to do what every day she does. Her daughter, already a professional inspired in the example of her father who is a professor, started to take care of her mother but also noticed that her father was doing something wrong out of the family. They discussed in a violent way publicly, and the mother before her death asked her to accept the life as it is and his father too. If you analyze the plot you may find that the situation drawn here is common in several other families all over the world. Life goes more or less smoothly until one of the member starts decaying, the family goes well but need all elements functioning, nobody is perfect and it is necessary to co-exist with the problems of the others making the life of each one compatible in the family and in the society. So the content of the film is quite interesting, but we should also acknowledge the acting of Meryl Streep, who in every film shows her extraordinary class, she is probably among the all-time five best actresses of cinema, while young Renée Zellweger did a work even much better than the one she did in Bridget Jones's Diary (2001). Her acting was so natural that at certain point I thought she was real. Certainly she is better to star in dramas than in comedies. William Hurt, as usual, acted also splendidly.

I expected to leave the theater as bleary-eyed as Streep's character was close to her final scenes, but instead felt empty and a bit depressed. In my opinion, for a movie like this to succeed there must be a) characters you warm up to early on, b) enough humor to balance out the extreme morbidity of the plot, and c) a sense that there is some greater reason for sitting through 2 hours of this.  One True Thing did not make the case in any of these areas, so I am calling it a failure.

Hence, he and his stay home wife would be plagued by financial woes, especially when she gets cancer.  Second, Streep is my age, and most women, particularly in her class (educated, white, well off) experienced the feminist movement.  Yet this woman seems oblivious to her anachronistic behavior.  I actually felt that she was a very controlling woman who kept her husband an emotional child by taking care of his every need.The fact that so many people were moved by the film is amazing.

She is the one, not her dying mother, who should be and is--the one true thing. it's not only in the role, in Zellweger's acting, but also in the plot itself.... Until, the plot turns against itself--and makes the mother the one true thing in the eyes of her weak willed, shallow husband who can do nothing right for his wife or daughter. The daughter perceives what the viewer perceives, but such intelligent perceptions must give way to the shallow sentiment of the husband who is blanked out on both the realities of his wife and daughter. To boot, the one powerful scene in this whole movie, when Ellen confronts her father's cruelty, is given the lie at the end. Ellen is just another young strong woman who must be tamed into conformity by a crybaby father. A very flawed movie--so flawed as to be called a bore and not worth the time.  "}]
