Reeves is a machinist in this movie who is helping the scientists build the parts not a scientist. And that matters in this movie because Reeves actually does pretty well for once as an actor. The concept of the movie isn't a new one, an industrial-military conspiracy to control technology because the masses aren't ready to deal with it yet. Freeman actually played the most interesting character. He kind of flip-flops throughout the movie and you're not sure what to think of him until the final scene.Regardless, it wasn't the best movie nor the worst movie ever made. Reeves acted pretty well and the writing was semi-believable. If you're looking for a fast paced movie that you don't have to think too much on - this movie isn't a bad rental to see.

Notwithstanding, Chain Reaction has excellent lighting and set design. There is overall a strong dependency on team acting and multiple scene rotations. This gives the film a docu-drama effect in the beginning. The fast paced scenes may obscure the plot for some. For me the cinemagraphic effects and acting are A-1. Obviously the writing and direction are good, or this film would not hold together at all, and it does. Because there is little character development, the focus is on scene development and approaching plot. This sort of editing technique and direction does not happen by chance and must be recognized as a valid concept. Most certainly a film with character and merit which can be enjoyed by those looking beyond a breadcrumb plot and a gingerbread house script. Good music score (odd, but good) with good sound effects. Forget the trailer, which has little or no correspondence to the film itself, or maybe it does. This is a rather strange film where one has to believe a group of people with unique ideas came together and produced a rather odd film with value. I enjoyed it.

One day, it seems that such a discovery has been made.  Soon after, however, the chief scientist is murdered and the invention stolen.  Eddie and fellow team member Dr. Lily Sinclair (Rachel Weisz) are suspects in the murder and are forced to go on the run.  Naturally, the police and the FBI are in hot pursuit.  Another team member Paul (Morgan Freeman) may have some secrets to hide as well.  Will the truth come out and will the fleeing duo be captured?This movie is mostly a chase picture and a moderately successful one. Much of the action is centered on the capture of Eddie and Lily.  There is an impressive scene, for example, where Eddie is trying to avoid seizure by climbing a raised bridge.  Unfortunately, not all of the scenes are as effective.  The scientific elements are quickly rushed over, causing some confusion as to what has transpired.  As for the romance between Reeves and Weisz, it is nicely subdued.  It's there but only manifests itself in a few embraces.  Although the ending is quite exciting, the overall effect of the movie as an action flick is only partly realized.  There are some missing plot elements that would have raised it to a higher level.  Recommended as a fairly good action motion picture; Reeves fans, certainly, will enjoy it.

Now don't get me wrong - I love Rachel Weisz, her character here was just a little wooden. Almost an agitator character if you will, giving Keanu the motivation to advance the story. Flimsy but functional writing.Morgan Freeman gives his now trademark I know more than you do, and you know it performance as the mysterious benefactor who clearly has his own agenda.Nothing wrong with this film, at least nothing critical, but it wont be at the top of too many must have lists.

Now the love interest story didn't have to be used but, we always need a girl. But under the circumstances of the story, there was no time to establish the love story.This movie for me was a character study. The characters in this film were well developed and convincing. The ambiguity of Morgan Freeman's character was interesting.  For instance, I never knew where Morgan Freeman's character was coming from or what his intentions were with Keanu. And the elevator scene close to the end shocked me. And he was smoking his cigar the entire time.    I liked seeing Keanu play a simple guy. Being a hero accidentally fell on his shoulders to me. When he and Rachael are running from the bad guys (whoever they were) and they go on the ice sled machine, he starts the machine up and it goes out of control for a minute. When she questions him, he replies The best I can. Now I don't know about you but that's impressive for a man to be real and unsure of the shaky circumstances that were dealt.  Its rare seeing a hero in films react like that, just real and honest. They need to do a chain reaction of real non-macho protagonist characters like that in more films.

This is not another sequel to THE FUGITIVE, it's actually CHAIN REACTION; a techno chase-thriller from director Andrew Davis, who also directed THE FUGITIVE. Like in that superior film, Davis displays his skills at staging perfectly exciting yet quite plausible action sequences. Unfortunately, the script this time is built around the action, rather than vice versa.The film's plot, about the discovery of water as a main component for creating a cheaper source of energy, is almost abandoned for most of the film in favor of a fairly ordinary chase thriller that has Reeves running from the FBI after being suspected for sabotage, being the only person alive after the explosion of the lab. And boy does he run! The chase moves from jumping from a bridge to chases in snowmobiles or helicopters. In fairness, Davis stages action very well and the stunts here are just what we expect from the man who perfectly staged the train wreck scene in THE FUGITIVE. Unfortunately, the movie stops being thrilling when it becomes a bit too predictable and rather pointless. It's just one chase after another as Reeves and companion Rachel Weisz dodges the feds for 107 minutes until they unmask the true saboteur (which, I suspect, the audience may have already found out halfway).Morgan Freeman is pretty good in a role that demands more of him, and Reeves is once again more impressive in the action rather than in the acting. But unlike in other movies like SPEED, Reeves fails to even display charisma or exhibit any chemistry with his female co-star Weisz (or is it because their characters really just doesn't have enough time to connect?). And when it all finally comes to a close, it didn't feel quite like the end of a movie but the end of a really long chase (of chase). As cinematic junk food goes, CHAIN REACTION is harmless and watchable, but even other mindless action movies have more meat than this.Rating **1/2 out of 5.

That sequence being the huge explosion that occurs near the start and wipes out a vast area of Chicago, nuclear in appearance. Now this was back in the days when CGI was still a newish weapon and big flashy destructive sequences like this were looked upon as impressive and breaking the barrier.Looking back it is a nice effect but of course its dated and the cracks are showing, but I'm not gonna moan about that. The problem is the rest of the film is really quite dull, visuals are dull, action is dull and the acting is even dull despite a very good cast line up. Reeves is his usual monotone self, Weisz is a complete drip and Freeman now looks pretty clichéd in his natty Malcolm X looking 90's suit and hat. It really does feel like they wanted to show off their CGI destruction sequence so they made an entire film around that one moment.

On the night their work actually pays off, and their experiment is a success, the team has a huge party. Later, an unknown faction basically destroys the building, wiping out eight city blocks. Eddie, who was returning to the building to pick up his motorcycle after seeing the tipsy Lily (Weisz) home, ends up being framed and goes on the run with Lily. Everyone is after them, especially after a police officer is killed, for which Eddie is blamed.This film had fantastic effects, imaginative stunts, and decent performances, with Rachel Weisz being wasted in an extraneous role. Freeman's character is deliberately ambiguous, and he does a good job at keeping us guessing. Handsome Keanu Reeves, not really a great actor, is nevertheless not a bad actor either, so he is able to hold his own.I don't mind a film being derivative, but my basic problem with this one occurs at the beginning. For me there just wasn't enough set-up.

(The exact science is not always clear, but this appears to be some sort of nuclear fusion). Someone, however, obviously wants to sabotage Eddie's discovery, and one of his colleagues is murdered and the laboratory is destroyed in a massive explosion. Eddie and another colleague, Dr. Lily Sinclair, are questioned by the police and the FBI, and quickly realise that someone is trying to frame them for both the murder and the explosion. They are forced to go on the run to try and clear their names and to expose the true culprits.It is not just the science upon which the film is based that is unclear; the plot too is often over-elaborate and difficult to fathom. We eventually learn that the real villains are agents of the Government and of Big Business, who are desperate to suppress Eddie's discovery because they fear that a new cheap, environmentally friendly source of energy would make oil obsolete, force all oil companies into bankruptcy and lead to economic depression and social chaos. In fact, capitalism is rather more adaptable than the screenwriters imagine; a new energy source of this nature, by dramatically reducing industry's energy costs, would more likely lead to an economic boom and huge profits for those companies who could exploit this lucrative new technology. Existing energy companies would probably be among them, just as many stagecoach owners made a fortune from the invention of the steam train by re-investing their money in railway shares. The only people with a vested interest in preventing such inventions reaching the market would be the governments of those countries which possess vast reservoirs of crude oil and very little else, but the film-makers doubtless thought that, in paranoid conspiracy-thrillers like this one, the United States Government makes a better villain than do foreign ones.Keanu Reeves's performance as Eddie is adequate but not outstanding. Rachel Weisz as Lily, in her first starring role in a Hollywood film, is rather muted, and gives little indication that she would later develop into a major talent. Probably the best acting comes from the generally reliable Morgan Freeman as Paul Shannon, Eddie's old mentor who may have a sinister agenda, but Chain Reaction is not one of the really great Freeman films like Glory, Unforgiven or The Shawshank Redemption.The film does have some better qualities. The director Andrew Davis has been praised by his visual sense, and Chain Reaction is visually very attractive. The action takes place in winter and there is some striking photography of a wintry, snow-bound Chicago, especially the scenes set in the grim industrial districts and around the astronomical observatory which plays an important part in the plot. The action sequences are exciting, fast-moving and well handled.Davis has a reputation for specialising in thrillers. His films tend to vary in quality, but he has at least one very good one to his credit, The Fugitive, one of the best thrillers of the nineties.

Production is nothing new and despite Andrew Davis being able to shoot action scenes, he is basically reciting what worked much better in his masterpiece The Fugitive. Keanu Reeves spends nearly the whole film running, and unfortunately he didn't run far enough because he still found his way back on the set. Morgan Freeman should leave the one-liners to the comedians. Weisz is there because the script called for a female and she obviously fits the description. Like Reeves, she spends nearly the whole film running and getting nearly blown to bits. Fred Ward plays a cop on the scene, which is pretty standard, and Kevin Dunn plays his partner. Together they are unable to rescue these roles from the avalanche of clichés. It is a pointless action driven disaster that should be used to test fire crackers on.

One reviewer said that the film doesn't mention sonoluminescence (it does, explicitly), others say that certain things aren't explained ie the explosion in the warehouse. Well d'uh! Hydrogen is not an inert gas and is highly flammable (mentioned a LOT in the film) and people complain about lack of plot then demonstrate they didn't understand it anyway! Chain Reaction is a science-heavy sci-fi chase film where two people who barely know each other are framed for something they didn't do and go on the run. Suspension of why didn't they just go to the FBI and explain aside, it's a ripping good fairly intelligent yarn which isn't dumbed down so it's not all spelled out, especially Shannon's character (Morgan Freeman) who throughout is ambiguous in who's side he is actually on. Aspects of the story are insidious - an environmentally friendly fuel that would revolutionise the world and a Government Agency wants to suppress it and an idealist is labelled a dreamer for wanting to make a difference. It's isn't too hard to believe that is a possible scenario. Okay some of the acting is a little cheesy but overall the performances were perfectly fine. Freeman of course is superior. Dr Alistair Barkley (Nicholas Rudall) was also a lovely actor and character, although not well known, and his monologue at the beginning is just superb and emotive - clearly the writing/screenplay was very good except for the repetition of everyone's names during conversation, that really gets on my nerves. The plot is as simple or as complex as you want. On the surface it's a simple on the run film, but the political conspiracy aspects and science-stuff make it a deeper story, which not being spelled out adds to the mystery. Reeves of course is excellent at the action, and plays resourceful convincingly and easily; I liked his dogged determination to rescue Lily and clear their names. Rachel Weisz's Physicist the too serious Lily is a bit weak, a bit of a drag on the survival given that everything is done for her but perhaps that is more realistic, women don't miraculously turn into gung-ho running leaping shooting and fighting survivalists, but I do expect her to do something but her emotions are very real especially regarding Chen (Tzi Ma). Whilst you see a potential romance on the cards for Eddie and Lily it's nice that the screenplay doesn't dwell on it, and the focus of the plot given the lack of time and Eddie Kasalivich being a gentleman.The SFX in the film are good, especially the explosions, and I'm betting Reeves does his own bike stunts. There are many stunts which are pretty good but they are within the bounds of realism - and this is generally why the characters are relatable and convincing. It's got a tense crescendo to how it runs out, and it's entertaining and adult without resorting to bad language and gratuitous violence - I would consider it almost a family film (older family). I'm not saying it's the best film every made, but I like all aspects of it to have seen it a number of times. I think some people try and read too much into the science, it's not supposed to be an episode of the Open University, it's just a science-fiction that isn't too far from feasible possibility. Just sit back and enjoy for some entertainment.

The only man they think they can trust is Eddie's mentor Paul Shannon but he is in no position as the FBI are watching him almost as keenly as they are watching Eddie and Lily. If they are to survive they will have to get out of Chicago and find a safe way to meet Shannon; all the time avoiding various law enforcement agencies and more dangerous characters working for the shadowy organisation that killed the scientist and destroyed his lab.While this is hardly a classic thriller it is a lot of fun; there are impressive explosions, numerous chases, shootings and a constant sense that our protagonists could be caught, or worse, at any moment. Keanu Reaves does a decent job as Eddie and Rachel Weiss is fine as Lily; however it is Morgan Freeman who dominates proceedings as Shannon; a man we aren't sure whether or not can be trusted for much of the film. Brian Cox also puts in a fun performance as the obvious villain Lyman Collier. The story itself is fairly silly but it is well told and there should be enough action and suspense to keep most viewers entertained well enough.

We've only the beginning and the ending scene where some hydrogen reaction is shown. Rest of the movie is all about catch Keanu if you can!

Keanu seems to easily find his way to a secret, heavily-guarded research facility, to not only rescue Rachel Weisz but also bring the entire kilometres-long facility crashing down to earth! That wasn't convincing. And also Rachel had a really weak role, as compared to Keanu or Morgan. Maybe that was the beginning phase of her career.Of course, it also bewilders me that Keanu also easily finds answers to fix the chemical reactions or even set it to explode if our bad guys don't turn back!

It begins with a professor and his team working out a method of extracting hydrogen from water to use this as fuel. Every time the experiment is run the reaction becomes unstable, until Eddie Kasalivich (Keanu Reeves) finds the correct frequency. After the experiment has succeeded, we see the professor and Shannon (Morgan Freeman) arguing. Later the entire facility is destroyed and eight city blocks are annihilated in what seems to be a nuclear explosion. Eddie and Lily Sinclair (Rachel Weisz) are framed for espionage and decide to run from the police.The movie then falls into one and a half hours of running away from police. One could term this as action, but ends up to be quite dry. What resurrects the dead movie is the mystery of who Shannon is. At first he seems to be a scientist, and then we learn that he is the head of a scientific group called the Moore Foundation and that he has some powerful contacts in the government. He has a huge house, limousine and access to top secret bases. At first it seems that the FBI are the bad guys but we learn that greater powers are leading them around.The main theme here what should be done with cheap electricity. If we find a way for producing it should we keep it hidden from people or should we distribute it all over the world. The industrialists do not want this as cheap electricity base purely on water will cause huge economic chaos. With the petroleum companies some of the most powerful companies in the world, their collapse, it is feared, will bring about a complete social collapse. Beyond this, the owners stand to loose out if their fossil fuel was to become obsolete.Chain Reaction didn't grab me on the video shelf and the only reason I hired it was because Jackie Chan was out and my sister didn't want to watch Lost World or The Saint.

Morgan Freeman isn't served much better, and definitely shouldn't be appearing in junk like this if he wants his career to stay afloat.The plot is minimal, and basically it's all one big cat and mouse movie with some poor CGI explosions. Frankly, the action isn't handled very well so many scenes are repetitive, a surprise considering that director Andrew Davies made some really exciting films with THE FUGITIVE and UNDER SIEGE.

In addition, if you're not able to take a few sci-fi leaps of faith, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Chain Reaction (1996) is very underrated and trashed by critics. I am a big fan of Keanu Reeves and Andrew Davis and I like this film a lot. Before I go into this review I want to talk why I log in and write a review. After watching the new Keanu Reeves movie Knock Knock (2015) I have realized not only how god awful that movie was, but even Keanu Reeves sucked at acting in that movie. In this movie Chain Reaction he at least acted solid and in Knock Knock he did not! He made a fool out of himself and he gave us the worst performance of his life! There was a lot of movies he started it and they weren't that good but they were not awful either. Some people are complaining how god awful Chain Reaction is. Watch Knock Knock (2015) the new Reeves movie and you will see the results. Which is far the worst comparing to Chain Reaction. I rather watch this movie and I am taking Chain Reaction over Knock Knock!!!!! I like this film a lot but not because of only Keanu Reeves but because of Andrew Davis, I have enjoyed his awesome Action flicks and even this film is Rated PG-13 and underrated it still doesn't ruing my likeness for seeing this movie again. I have always enjoy it of watching this movie. Rachel Weisz co stars in this movie as opposite of Morgan Freeman and Keanu Reeves. 9.years later Keanu and Rachel teamed back together in Supernatural horror flick Constantine (2005). Overall I like this movie! I believe it is exactly what would happen if technology like this was released. I think this movie was smart and slick even for underrated film. The technology putting in here was really smart idea and it was fast paced. I still don't know what went wrong and why the critics panned this film?. It held together quite well and the action was perfect for the characters. The message is important and timely (was in 1996 as well). Morgan Freeman does a superb job.Chain Reaction is a decent film to watch and, ironically, it's topic is even more current now than it was back in 1996. Conspiracy theorists will love it. Morgan Freeman and Keanu Reeves make an excellent pairing and when you add such veteran character actors like Fred Ward and Brian Cox, you simply cannot go wrong. Rachel Weisz, while she's a great addition to this movie, seems like an odd pairing with Keanu Reeves. All in all, if you're looking for a great action movie, popcorn movie and conspiracy movie all rolled into one, you simply cannot go wrong with Chain Reaction. This mid 90's action/thriller from the director of The Fugitive and Under Siege features a post Bill & Ted alum Keanu Reeves and Morgan Freeman. Fairly new Rachel Weitz and some other good character actors. Chain Reaction fills the hour & 40 min void with thrilling action and semi-suspenseful drama as this typical cat & mouse game plays out. Government conspiracy or cover-up or perhaps both are involved within this flick. A student machinist finds himself caught in a maze of murder, government cover-ups and hi-tech espionage while working on a ground-breaking scientific experiment. Eddie Kasalivich and Lily Sinclair are part of a team of scientists who have developed a revolutionary new source of energy. But no sooner have they finished celebrating their triumph, than their lab is destroyed and the head of their team killed. Named as the main suspects, Eddie and Lily quickly realize their only hope lies with Paul Shannon, a powerful and foundation head, who may or may not be on their side.That is the basic plot of this movie. It does involves of two students been a fugitives for a crime they did not commit. I am giving this movie a 7/10 it is not a perfect movie the best or one of the greatest movies of all time, but it is still solid and fun to watch!Chain Reaction is a 1996 American action film directed by Andrew Davis, starring Keanu Reeves, Morgan Freeman, Rachel Weisz, Fred Ward, Kevin Dunn and Brian Cox. 7/10 Score B Studio 20TH Century Fox Starring Keanu Reeves, Morgan Freeman, Rachel Weisz, Fred Ward, Kevin Dunn, Brian Cox Director Andrew Davis Screenplay J.

Another on a frozen Wisconsin lake. There are big research lab sets and they're impressive, and two actions scenes involve them.As usual in such movies, plausibility is sometimes stretched to the breaking point and beyond as the hero manages to escape the clutches of his pursuers, who are professionals while he's an amateur. It's a kind of wrong man or framed kind of plot where the hero, Keanu Reeves, accompanied by Rachel Weisz, go on the run with the police authorities from the FBI (led by Fred Ward) on down to local police after them. The music is suitably emphatic and jarring at times. There's quite a lot of running in this movie. Reeves runs and runs and runs on foot. Morgan Freeman nicely plays a kind of high CIA-linked DARPA person. It's all about a process that can produce hydrogen gas from water efficiently, thus promising a clean energy revolution, but Freeman and associates want to control it rather than allow it to shake up the market. They are the bad guys, among them Brian Cox, the ones who murder, so they are after Reeves as well as the cops and FBI.Reeves is reasonable as a long-haired scientist. Weisz is along for the ride. With her accent and modern digital audio, not as good as analog of the old days or perhaps not recorded as well, and with her speaking so softly, some of her dialog is muffled. This is no great loss. She's the only one with that issue.This is a pretty fast-paced movie, drawing from James Bond, conspiracies, Hitchcock and the general action milieu.

The soundtrack is a horrible, bargain basement, cliché score with no tracks to invigorate the film.What this film really lacks is a Tommy Lee Jones level character to do the chasing like in The Fugitive and U.S. Marshals. Instead we are left with a mixture a baddies and cops with a 90's made-for-TV feel to them. This is somewhat surprising as director Andrew Davis helmed The FugitiveThis film is notable as being Rachel Weisz's breakthrough role but the film sadly lacks the talent, humour and charisma evident in her subsequent roles. Most notably of these is where she teams up with Keanu again for one of my all time favourite films Constantine. The science fiction element of this film is negligible and will disappoint sci-fi fans. I would recommend rather watching Johnny Mnemonic or The Matrix. However the concept of the story is very relevant. A new power source like Cold Fusion would be a major economic and political game changer.The constant chase scenes distract from the underlying government conspiracy story, which could easily have been better fleshed out to give us a film more on the level of Sneakers.There is a good storyline to this film.

Ice-covered lakes, stark bare tree trunks that look black against the snow. It gets so cold that at night you hear trees crack when their sap freezes. In upstate New York, I used to stare out the windows during dull lectures and wonder how the Iroquois could have survived winters in such a climate. Here, unfortunately, we have to look at interiors in Chicago and Washington, DC, and even in the exterior scenes the actors have a habit of getting in the way of the scenery.What happens, very briefly, is that a handful of naive young scientists, including Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz, are involved in an experiment which they hope will supply the world with energy that costs almost nothing. They don't know it but they're working on a secret CIA project. The company intends to suppress the results of the experiment because they don't want a world-wide panic when oil becomes nothing more than a paleontological curiosity.It's cheap energy that is the MacGuffin here, but it could be anything else -- a Fountain of Youth serum, the top-secret formula for Coca Cola, a single pill that keeps you high the rest of your life, a draught that turns you into a Priapistic monster in the blink of an eye, the missing National Guard records of an important personage, the tax returns of another -- anything you like.The whole thing is exciting and full of propulsion and is written and directed strictly by the numbers. It could have come out of Screen writing for Dummies. There is intrigue and suspense in the story, but only enough of a plot to link the violent episodes together, or the chase scenes, just as there's enough plot in a pornographic movie to bring the performers physically together.The casting and direction are able to clear the same, very low bar. The evildoers look ugly. The well-meaning but confused FBI guys look well-meaning but confused. The two innocent leads are beautiful. Not a single opportunity is wasted in pumping up the adrenalin of the viewers. If a hero is being chased across the Michigan Avenue drawbridge and it begins to open, he must reach the very end of the tilted structure and dangle from it. If he and the heroine run through a tunnel while being pursued, he must hold her hand and pull her along behind him. They can out-race exploding fireballs.Why go on? It's an effective chase thriller if that's what you're looking for. And Morgan Freeman gives an outstanding performance, saddled as he is with lines like, The world isn't all that simple, Eddie. What's most bothersome is that the problem that should be at the heart of this heartless movie is almost entirely dispensed with. Homo sapiens' place in the ecosystem in which he plays such an important part is hardly dealt with -- not even in passing. Our place in nature seems to be too important to be used as a Hollywood gimmick, a device to hang an uninspired plot from. I don't mean the movie has to be full of gravitas. But even comedies have done a better job of dealing with the kinds of questions this film raises. See The Man in the White Suit for an example.

There is also the disturbing and inevitable Truth that if a source of Free Energy is discovered, the Power Elite will suppress it and destroy anything or anybody who would stop them from keeping it for themselves. It is dangerous being Green.The Movie utilizes these two profound Truths, one undeniable (Suppression) and the other almost a certainty (Clean Free Energy), but the whole thing feels like it is running on Empty.

There's a good story, plot twists, good characters played by good actors, good effects, but it's all kind of 90%. Maybe they were trying to be mysterious and aloof, but it just seemed sort of vague and disjointed, keeping you at arm's length, not really giving enough to draw you in and really care about the characters. After a while you start to care, mainly because of who the actor(s) is/are, but it's that 90% thing. The continuity is spotty at times and some of the action sequences seemed very contrived, almost cartoonish. Then there's the running. Lots and lots of running. When you hear about someone being on the run, this movie is all over it. I got tired just watching all the running. More running than a 70's TV police drama. I think there *might* have been a car chase at one point, but it was mainly foot chases. Anyway, I think 10% more character development would have made this a really great movie, but it's not a horrible movie either. I recommend it for light entertainment, but not if you get upset when everything doesn't fit together neatly and seamlessly. It's a good Saturday-afternoon type of movie to have on in the background doing housework. I give it 2 feather dusters UP!

The movie gathered on it two of my favorite nowadays actors Keanu Reeves (SPEED, THE MATRIX) and Rachel Weisz (THE MUMMY). In My opinion Keanu Reeves is still going strong in every movie  (SPEED was, so far, clearly the best one, followed by THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE and THE MATRIX) The plot is not good for real, but the director Andrew Davis saved it with a thumbs up. Rachel Weisz didn't even try to hide her British accent, that's why she makes the part of a brilliant english scientist that starts seeing her life being framed when she and her partner Eddie Kasalivic (Reeves) are said to be murders and treasers., the scene when they are at the coffee shop, when their photos appear on TV with the 'Wanted' stamp on it, is just great. Morgan Freeman also makes part of the cast, but his performance isn't so good has it was on DEEP IMPACT and Se7en. There is also place for special effects, which are very good when the warehouse explodes. As in every good movie there is always it's step(s) back. 1.-In this one there was when the warehouse explodes, Reeves starts running on his motorcycle and the explosion it's so fast and so big that unexplainably doesn't catch him. 2.- The old story of the helicopter firing at the actors on a roof top and not a single bullet hits them. 3.- When they are trapped in the lab the nuclear blast should have killed them, but instead it doesn't kill and they get out of there alive and half clean, half dirty (so much for the movie supervisors)!

Crippled by a lack of emotional depth on screen and having erased any trace of his comic origins, Reeves relies on the strength of his co-stars to get him through the movie like a vampiric Cary Grant. Point Break (the last Reeves film I watched the other day) had a resurgent Patrick Swayze stealing the limelight and here, it's Morgan Freeman taking top honours. However, neither can salvage this middling action conspiracy nonsense which is clearing trying to emulate director Andrew Davis' earlier smash The Fugitive.Reeves plays scientist Eddie Kasalivich who is part of a team trying to develop potentially unlimited sources of energy using just water and lasers (it's complicated but the equipment looks very good on screen). After stumbling onto the secret, Kasalivich is amazed to find their theories proved correct. But before the news can get out, the team's leader (Nicholas Rudall) is murdered and their lab destroyed. With the FBI breathing down his neck, Kasalivich is framed for the disaster along with fellow scientist Lily Sinclair (Rachel Weisz) and both go on the run to uncover the truth. But their only contact is project funder Paul Shannon (Morgan Freeman) who has motives of his own and may not be all that he seems.Nothing about this film seems exceptional or special in any way at all, with the exception of Freeman's performance. He easily grabs the acting honours from Reeves and Weisz, who run and hide for all they're worth but nothing more. Good support comes from Brian Cox and Fred Ward as the man leading the manhunt. But the film is only really worth watching when there are action scenes on screen - away from the stunt-work and pyrotechnics (which are adequate enough), the film barely seems to move at all. Reeves just can't carry a movie on his own and even when you give him a plot to get his teeth into, he still cannot convey the emotional complexity required to play someone on the run and searching for his nemesis. What am I saying, he doesn't have the emotional complexity to play a piece of driftwood! But the film's other problem, apart from the facially-static Reeves, is a plot which never surprises or challenges in any way. With more passion and enthusiasm, this could have been great instead of average.Chain Reaction is in need of a serious catalyst before it starts reacting with this viewer. It passes the time well enough but without a charismatic hero and a meatier script, it relies too much on Freeman's performance and Reeves' stunt-work to pull it through and it only just does it. There was potential here for a classic but Andrew Davis fluffs it, trying too hard to remake The Fugitive instead of making this film stand out on its own. As such, it disappears into the vast chasm of anonymous films that come and go without really making an impact. There are better films than this with framed heroes on the run - Enemy Of The State or even The Bourne Identity are two excellent examples, as well as The Fugitive. Watch it once if it's on TV but if you spend any money on it (like I did) then you'll likely be disappointed.

If yes, this is a film to put on your Christmas list.Keanu Reeves offers a solid performance as a machinist who stumbles across the key to hydrogen power (a little hard to believe, but it works). While his acting is always a little odd, his action skills are honed here in a manner very similar to what we saw of him in Speed, which I mean to be a compliment.Rachel Weisz was also good, although her role seemed to be nothing more than the pretty lady in trouble. We don't see her being the physicist she plays, and her action scenes are often just Reeves saving her from gunmen and hydro-hovercrafts. But her demure beauty is perfect in this film, so I guess I didn't really notice her shortcomings.Morgan Freeman is Morgan Freeman. His role here is very similar to his detective role in Seven, only now he has a cigar that is always on him but never lit. If you like the dark, mysterious Freeman then you'll love him in this.The action scenes are good, but what really drives this movie is the mystery and conspiracy. The twists and turns are guessable, but not completely predictable. You'll have fun whether you know the results ahead of time or not. Think of this as the poor man's version of Enemy of the State.I approve of this film as a light yet gripping piece, and I want to give one last shout-out to Fred Ward, whose role as an FBI agent seemed absolutely fitting (and if there was ever a sequel, make sure he comes back).

The whole fugitive-secrete agency aspect was the strongest theme in the movie, yet wasn't interesting enough to place you on the edge of your seat. Nor did it leave you satisfied at the end of the movie. The relationship between Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz, makes no progress in the movie, and very little time is given to their character development.And finally besides the introduction hardly any explanation is given to scientific part of the movie.  This is similar to The Saint, which only had a brief lecture by the physicist involved. The concept of sonoluminescence, which is the process of turning sound energy into light energy, was never mentioned in the movie, although that was the basis of the all the science involved. Admittedly even the title of this process is a mouthful, but if a brief explanation were given, then you would have been able to understand the significance of finding the right frequencies and the etc.The movie was also let down by some inconsistencies, such as when Reeves and Weisz were covered in white dust, and then are mysteriously dust free the next scene. The explosion that Keanu Reeves out runs on his motor cycle, (which WASN'T NUCLEAR as many people mistook it to be) looked stunning, even though no explanation was given to it's cause.

Narrowly escaping a blast that destroys several city blocks, Eddie and Dr Lily Sinclair find themselves on the run from the police as someone seems to be framing them for the crime.Director Davis seems to be a man who has worked out a formula in the same way as the scientist of this movie are trying to.  However, we have seen this formula before and need to see something different to be entertained.  Unfortunately Davis sticks to his Fugitive formula here, so we have lots of running, we have conspiracy, we have a charismatic cop hunting him etc.  There is nothing awful about this film, it is just very second rate &#150; and the reason it appears second rate is because it was all done much better in The Fugitive.The plot is a little muddled and doesn't flow as well as it could &#150; I found it best to forget the conspiracy side and just try to get into the action.  However even this is a bit forced.  Chases across a bridge and a frozen lake are just too forced to be exciting, there is none of Fugitive's exciting set pieces and the film generally lacks a real sense of excitement or tension.The cast looks good on paper but the material, the characters and the performances all conspire to foil the line up of names.  Reeves may be the lord of the dance with Matrix, but here he shows himself a poor leading man, he doesn't look like a machinist on the run nor does he bring out emotions of desperation or fear &#150; both of which he really needed to engage the audience.  Weisz is desperately bland and dull.  Freeman's character is muddled and it affects his ability, finally he settles into just being a presence rather than a force.  Cox is a strong actor but his character is not shown to have real teeth, yes he kills people but he is really just a businessman.  Ward takes Jones' role from him; very big shoes which Ward is far from able to fill.  He's OK but everything about his character is the same but Ward can't make him as charismatic as Jones did.Overall this is watchable but it just all feels very average at best.

Just imagine how many people, global interests would like to see a project like this fail ...... but they can't even do that right. It all fizzles out. Yeah there is a conspiracy, but it basically boils down to Reeves running around as the one man discovery team trying to find out what happened, clear himself of any implication in the matter and survive various people trying to plug him in the head. Tell me you haven't seen that before. It's not carried out with a fresh creative flair either. As if the fireball escape sequence early in the movie wasn't a good indication of what route this movie was heading down. Three words. The beaten path.Chain Reaction is just run of the mill.

By a complete fluke machinist Eddie Kasalivich (Keanu Reeves) discovers the solution to make the process work, Dr. Barclay is an idealist & works for the good of mankind wanting the new process to benefit everyone. Unfortunately not everyone shares his views & a saboteur within the team organises an explosion which destroys all their work, Eddie & English physicist Lily Sinclair (Rachel Weisz) are blamed for the explosion & hunted by the FBI, the police & the evil organisation who set them up in the first place & want the secret of the process for themselves...Co-produced & directed by Andrew Davis one has to say that I was slightly disappointed by this rather routine & uninspiring big budget action thriller. The potential for a great film is there, a huge budget, several A-list Hollywood stars (at the time anyway), an experienced action film director & a fun central premise that had the potential to be an intelligent action thriller with a sound moral message about the need for clean efficient energy. Unfortunately what Chain Reaction actually is is a rather lacklustre instantly forgettable by-the-numbers thriller that doesn't even make for a particularly good popcorn action flick. The script by J.F. Lawton & Michael Bortman is also rather messy, there are several issues which aren't tied up to any great satisfaction as far as I was concerned. For instance it's never really made that clear who is behind the explosion & sabotage, sure there's this guy in a suit behind a desk but who is he? Why didn't these people just hire the team themselves under the pretence that they were developing the process for the good of mankind? Surely then after the process is perfected they could have killed them all off? Why did they think that blowing up all their hard work & killing their friends would convince the remaining team members to continue the research? There are too many scenes of supposedly sinister people in business suits trying to out evil each other, please do me a favour. The notion that machinist Reeves manages to solve the problems with the hydrogen energy process all on his own that an entire team of scientists can't by a complete fluke is also stretching the credibility a bit too far. Then the script puts the blame on big business, yet again it's the big businesses & the people who run them that are responsible for everything wrong in our society, seen it all before haven't we? The actual science in Chain Reaction is total nonsense although it does try to present an interesting reason as to why a cheap clean energy source may not be good in that the economy might crash but the idea is not developed beyond a single conversation between two people.Director Davis is more or less remaking his own earlier film The Fugitive (1992) as both feature a leading Hollywood actor on the run from a larger conspiracy & having to prove his innocence while at the same time avoiding capture, sounds familiar right? Here in Chain Reaction the one big difference is that there are two people on the run instead of one, unfortunately Rachel Weisz's character is given virtually nothing to do & apart from look good is totally surplus to requirements. Another disappointment were the action scenes, sure the explosion in the opening fifteen minutes is impressive but there after there's very little here to get excited about, there are a few dull chases which amount to nothing, there's a few fight scenes & another explosion at the end. The most notable aspects of these sequences are the settings which are impressive, from a huge frozen lake to a science museum & it's exhibits to an underground silo to a good looking scene set on a huge split bridge.With a supposed budget of about $55,000,000 Chain Reaction flopped big time at the box-office taking less than $8,000,000 during it's opening weekend. To be fair it is well made with impressive production values & has that glossy Hollywood feel about it. The acting is alright from a cast that is wasted on this, Reeves is OK, I have always liked Rachel Weisz who replaced Mira Sorvino when she pulled out but she looks uninterested & bored here, Morgan Freeman deserves better than this while Fred Ward is miscast as a tough FBI agent & Brian Cox has a terrible accent as the bland bad guy who was originally going to be played by Tommy Lee Jones until he was replaced.Chain Reaction is a throughly average action thriller, it has one or two decent moments & a much, much better cast than it deserves but even that can't lift it above mediocre at best with some poor plotting, unclear motives & a typical absence of logic.

Keanu Reeves is never that believable in his role and I've always thought of him as an overrated actor. Rachel Weisz, in her debut film, adds little to her character as the obligatory female sidekick; she's not that believable as a physicist either. The script is also long on boring plot development, and the resulting character motivations make too little sense at times. There are continuity problems in here also, signifying lazy film making.

Andrew Davis became addicted to this formula. First (The Package &#x96; 1989), then the most acclaimed (The Fugitive &#x96; 1993), and now (Chain Reaction &#x96; 1996). Mr. Davis can make nice action with solid scripts and bright factors. He understood the way Hollywood fares were made, and got a decent career out of it during the 1990s. As for Chain Reaction, it wanted to be a Chain Reaction of a movie. And it did in a way. However, despite the action sequences, the intense orchestrated music of (Jerry Goldsmith), and (Rachel Weisz)'s unquestionable beauty; it's easy to forget, being the least important Fugitive movie Davis did yet.It is nothing but a well-made chase after another, while the in-betweens are filled by some talking between the good guys and the bad guys. So there is not much about the characters, since the whole time is devoted for the run not the runners. It's only the character of (Morgan Freeman) who got a lot of concerning that made it real interesting, compared to the rest or not. Let alone how (Freeman) did it with massive charisma, low-tone, and one hell of stylish costume.The enemy is from inside this time (high people in high places). That's usual since the 1970s. Now it's the flat commercial dealing. Speaking of which, the movie is determined on being just the very pure MOVIE where any much seriousness is out. That's sure turned the time into continuous running in different places with a lead character that doesn't encourage you to interact with. So this episodic, kind of empty, condition made it as another James Bond, or should I say a poor man's James Bond; without the international locations, the super gadgets, the fistfights, the many babies, and most of all the fun. Hence I didn't get wholly into it, doing nothing but watching what ended up as cold thrill. Well, the exaggerated CGI explosion, that would have burned Superman himself, while the lead survived totally unharmed, rather totally illogically from it; CAN summarize fine the feel that this movie gives, as dazzling yet fake!To make things even worse the Fugitive this time wasn't Hackman or Ford, he's the one and only (Keanu-doesn't-know-how-to-act-Reeves) ! Dear (Reeves) wasn't as half interesting as the most boring reeve you have ever met. He isn't a persuasive hero in the first place (so how about playing a detailed-less role !). In fact he was more effective in (Speed) in a way I didn't see it from him to date. But anyway his hair here does move well during the chases! There isn't a thing between the 2 leads. That's not too popular thing to do (No. He wasn't gay in the movie !). But sorrowfully it managed not to be smartly distinct (friends, colleagues, whatever..). And I don't think that that was done for focusing more on the movie's issue; I'm sure they just didn't have the time, plus wanted this movie P.G. more than ever. That took some emotional substance this movie could have had, making it more lifeless on the inside, and leading to the fact that there wasn't a sex scene (bummer I know !); especially while the gorgeous (Weisz) was near to die frozen, needing HEAT to be saved. They even made her shower later WITH HER CLOTHES ON !All in all (Chain Reaction) is one watchable movie but it missed many things to be less forgettable, like deeper treatment, stronger lead, and maybe&#x85;more heat ! Finally, my title is what I think the 2 main leads were saying to themselves while going to the shooting of this movie, and what the makers of it are saying to us through this escapist anyway. However, I saw better Chain Reactions !

Okay Freeman won't be nominated for any awards in this movie but even in a very average role Freeman acts Reeves off the screen , in fact the trees in the background also manage to hold their own with Reeves performance . It should also be pointed out that because he was marketed as an action hero at the time Reeves scientist dude ( I won't bother to write  Character  that would be misleading and might get me into a libel court ) must undertake lots of heroic deeds like getting into punch ups and gun fights with the bad guys .

Eddie has a brand-new project that is going to blow the world away - literally. Because his experiment sets off a chain of events, or CHAIN REACTION -- ding-ding! -- that succeeds in demolishing an entire building, city, and more. But methinks that it has nothing to do with his theories nor experiments -- it all is on-screen so audiences can see things go boom.But of course, if we as an audience wanted to see things go boom without a reasonable plot in the first place, we would just go see an Arnold Schwarzenegger film, which tend to have an amount of fun in them to satisfy anyone's cinematic action tastes. Chain Reaction thinks it's real smart and tries to be real smart by inserting lots of smart dialogue, in hopes that audiences will think it's a smart movie. It's not. It's more ridiculous than anything, and the long stretches of scientific mumbo-jumbo dialogue stand in the way of what we want to see -- fights, explosions, and big booms. And besides, how could the filmmakers possibly believe casting Keanu Reeves as a physicist would convince audiences it was a smart film? A slacker computer nerd who turns out to be The Chosen One, okay, yeah, I'll buy that, but a physicist? Insert guffaw here.Eddie works for Dr. Barkley (Nicholas Rudall), who is trying to extract sources of energy, or power for the layman, from water.

He basically tries to frame them for doing exactly what Bill Clinton did. As Homer Simpson once said For shame.
