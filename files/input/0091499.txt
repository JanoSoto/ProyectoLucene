I view it as a funny and entertaining, B-grade action/sci-fi flick. There's mass destruction and tons of carnage as everything on-screen is blown to bits...plus it's got Emilio Estevez. What's better than that? The movie does require major suspension of disbelief as some of the story elements don't work (for example the honeymooner's car works just fine, but every other machine on earth, from lawn-mowers, electric knives, trucks, and even steam-rollers, go haywire). But then again, this movie is all about fun. The best part of the movie (besides Emilio) is that no one is shown any sympathy...not even kids; in one stand-out scene, a steam-roller comes out of nowhere and completely squashes this innocent kid. Maximum Overdrive is a cool and outrageous cult classic that Stephen King should be proud of. Sadly, I feel that King will never direct again.Note for genre buffs C.H.U.D. alumni Frankie Faison and J.C. Quinn star in the movie. King himself also cameos as the ATM guy.

A group of people trying to stay alive hold up at the Dixie Boy truck stop.

The 'Who made Who' theme song conducts the beginning of the movie excellent when a traffic bridge is starting to open beyond human control. The same goes for the other songs in the movie - they really add. Secondly I like the movie for the humor in it. It's not a comedy but some scenes made me laugh - like the bible sales man who gets mad when his car is hit by a truck and he runs outside the roadhouse - cursing like hell; the truck hits him into a sewer and his shoes stay behind. Or the beginning of the movie in which you see a guy withdrawing money from an ATM and on the screen the message appears 'you're an *sshole'. 'Sugar buns, this thing is calling me an *sshole !' If you watch closely you might also notice just before this scene a digital clock on the building on which the time changes into F*CK YOU. Maybe I'm just simple but I like the movie.

An alien ship flying inside a strange cloud causes the machines on the planet to go haywire and the story focus on a small band of misfits trying to survive.Heading up this band is Emilio Estevez who at the time was a bigger star than his little brother Charlie Sheen. the movie is perfect for him as it's similar to other B-movies he toke the lead on during his hey day like Repo man and Men at Work, which he did with his brother.

For one, its' total ineptitude has an effect of unintentional laughter, and lets face it, thats entertainment. Another reason is that this, 'Salem's Lot' and 'Creepshow' are a few of the first horror films that I have ever seen. (at the tender age of 10 years old.) So I must admit, Stephen King has been with me for quite a long time. If you have seen every King film, or read every King novel, then you are like one of the heroic characters portrayed within them. You have survived! Now with all the banter aside, heres the facts. This movie is a perfect example of a complete ludicrous effort by an outstanding author being talked into directing a film. (and rushed into it as well) There are no words to explain how many plot holes are in this thing. The premise is A rogue comet passes over earth causing machines (except cars???) to turn against mankind. A group of people are stranded in a truck stop by an army of trucks that circle the gas station continuously. The audience is bombarded with some of the most ridiculous sequences imaginable. Lawnmowers drive themselves, electric knives move about by themselves, a rear axle literally spins off of a truck!!!?, people are strangled to death by Walkmans, people are mowed down by giant tractor trailers without seeing them coming!!??, and so on and so forth. Not an ounce of logic or reasoning is attempted during the whole 98 minutes of this film.Now for the good stuff. King purposely designed this to be excessive and vulgar, and that he did! Fans of senseless violence will approve, and it seems like its all done for laughs. Emilio Estevez makes for a good hero type. Vulnerable when he should be, a man of action when its needed. Unsavory and annoying characters get their just desserts. (a mobile military firearm extinguishes half the cast in one scene!), and the AC/DC full soundtrack makes it worthwhile. This is definitely a favorite film among adolescents. A true juvenile delinquent's fantasy. So who cares how bad it really is.

I mean, in the world of Overdrive people's bodies seem to pop like grapes when trucks hit them, so how seriously can you take that?

Unfortunately the elements of the film that are simply, and unpleasantly bad overpower the film and weigh down what laughs there are, which is why I settled on a poorer-than-poor rating.

Maximum Overdrive is based on a short story titled Trucks, featured in his short story collection, Night Shift. In the trailer, he said that he wanted to see someone do Stephen King right. Several years later, he confessed that it was a moron film. Should Stephen King be that ashamed of directing this movie? Not necessary. Sure, it's complicated, it's twisted, and none of these supernatural trucks are explained very well. And sure, Stephen King probably has more to hate about this film than having to play the guy who gets called an a-hole by an ATM machine.

Why, one done by Stephen King himself of course! 1986's Maximum Overdrive was the first and only directing job by Stephen King. Adapted from King's short story Trucks, it presents the tale of machines of all types coming alive all of a sudden to wreck havoc on the human race and in particular, an assorted group of truckers, newlyweds, cooks, and grease monkeys at a roadside truck stop. At the same time, there's a strange, green comet in earth's atmosphere that seems to be the cause of all the chaos and if our heroes at the truck stop can hold out for just a few days until the comet passes, they may stand a chance. Problem is, can they survive everything man-made thrown at them?The film features plenty of gore, death and destruction, and some good performances for a film of this type. Starring in the lead role is Emilio Estevez as ex-con and parolee Bill Robinson in a worthy and street smarts performance, who's forced to work for shyster and all around shady truck stop owner Bubba Hendershot (Pat Hingle in an excellently done slimy performance) as per condition of his parole when the world goes to hell. Joining them is a couple on newlyweds (Played by John Short and Yeardley Smith in a comedic and kind of cute performance), a young, pretty hitchhiker with a switchblade named Brett (Laura Harrington) and a wide assortment of redneck truckers and all around zany characters. Stalking them is anything from big, semi-trucks to lawnmowers, from bulldozers to army jeeps with machine guns. Just about any machine you can imagine turns into a bloodthirsty killer. Hell, even a soda machine turns deadly! But the machine you are probably going to remember the most after the credits roll is the Happy Toys truck, a big semi with the hilarious looking face of the green goblin as its front grill! Helping set the mood to all this is a score and soundtrack by the legendary rock band ACDC, including the song Who Made Who. To be sure, Maximum Overdrive won't win any academy awards or praise from the critics anytime soon! But at the same time, I don't think the film warrants the level of criticism it's gotten either. The film is an outrageous, zany B-movie that's not meant to be taken seriously. It's the type of film you'd see on Cinemax or the old USA Network back in the day. Some parts are you can't help but laugh at (such as when the one hysteric waitress at the diner suddenly bolts out door and yells the famous line, WEEE Made YOOOUUU!), others nasty or bizarre. Either way, the film entertains. Sadly, though, the overall experience of making the film and the reaction it received has pretty much guaranteed that Stephen King will never direct another film again (King admits he was coked out of his mind while directing and based on his appearance in the trailer they made, I believe him!). Still, if you're in the mood for a ridiculous, B-movie adventure, Maximum Overdrive is one film where you can't go wrong. And last but not least, never forget the eternal question Who made who?

Something to note about Stephen King's young characters is that he almost always has one, and the one is usually sharp! The same was true for Deke. Although he obviously came from a not-so-brilliant family or location, he could hold his own with no problem.If you love the 80's and your into horror flicks, check this one out! By the way, the annoying Connie (Yeardley Smith) is also the voice-actress for Lisa Simpson!

I read the short story before I saw the movie, and the short story seemed to be written, to be taken seriously.  The movie on the other hand was written for a campy affect, and that is how it comes off.  People getting soda cans embedded into there skulls, by the soda machines, is a great new way to off a character.  I could almost guarantee that had never been done before.  The soundtrack by AC/DC compements the movie well.  One of the greatest metal bands, writing the soundtrack for a great metal movie.  Some have said this movie was a waste of time.  Well it's probably not the most prudent way to spend an hour and a half, but then again how many movies really are?  One commenter mentioned that it didn't follow the short story, then went on to say that the Shawshank Redemption loosely followed King's short story of the same name.  I have one question for this guy.  Have you ever read these two stories?  Especially Shawshank, because Shawshank was one of the few movies I have seen that followed the original story almost exactly.  Please don't make comments about things that you have no idea what you're talking about.  Thank you.  If you like campy B-movies based on King's work check this out.  If you only like serious movies based on King's work, go watch The Green Mile, it's one of his best.  For a fun no brainer movie I would give this 8 out of 10.

Joe Bob Riggs' comments make the movie hilarious.  Anyway, this movie is a great way to waste time.  I must admit, even though the acting is terrible, this is one of the few films I could watch every single day and not get tired of.  The best scene is near the end when Emilio Estevez and crew are at the boat dock.  One of the guys sees a dead woman in her truck, and she's wearing a wedding ring.  So, the guy completely forgets that the trucks are in close pursuit, walks over to the woman, and takes her ring.  As he's walking slowly back over to the boat, eyes focused entirely on the ring he's just scored, one of the trucks comes out and rams him.  Emilio Estevez then uses a missile launcher to destroy the truck.  The funny part is that everyone starts throwing their hands up in victory and cheering while a very upbeat AC/DC song starts playing.  If you tuned in just as the song started, you would never know that one of their friends had just been killed.  When I saw this scene, I started convulsing with laughter.  I mean, this movie was so wacked out and shallow, that it was I actually enjoying it.  Do not buy it, and do not rent it. Tape it next time it's on TNT's Monstervision.

I adore his books, I think he is one of the most brilliant writers in the history of mankind and I have loved most of his films especially the ones that truly capture the King vibe. Maximum Overdrive does not fit this bill. Ironically enough it is THE ONLY Stephen King film written and directed by Stephen King himself as he touted that the best way to have King directed was to direct it himself. While I admit the film does have some King flare to it...the isolation, the small rag tag group hidden away from some monstrosity fighting against each other and the supernatural but the film itself is campy, and kind of stupid, and despite it's huge special effects and slightly disturbing plot line it just doesn't really fit the scare tactic. It's more corny and laughable than anything. All that being said Maximum Overdrive is not a complete wash. First of all the cast is fairly decent, they seem to fit into the King vibe fairly well and it's action is enough to keep you interested complete with laughs and some chills and some really gory kills. On top of that Maximum Overdrive has to the winner for most gratuitous use of GOD LORD etc and every various way you can use the Lord's name. It stands out like they did it on purpose. Definitely an R Rated film.Eighties super-kid Emilio Estevez takes the lead as the rough and tough bad boy hero. His character is very stereotypical and yet he is watchable in the role and adds enough to the film to keep it interesting. It's just no great acting feat for him and he can act. Pat Hingle is terrific as the snarly, egotistical diner owner who immediately butts heads with Estevez. Hingle's cowboy type villain is one of the best characters in the film. Laura Harrington is the typical eighties eye candy gal but she does get a little more substance. She's rough around the edges, independent and very tom boyish right down to her name but seduces Estevez into bed...well a cot in the back of the diner/gas station. She is a little more active than just eye candy actually putting forth a hero type effort and her and Estevez are not bad together. Not a force of nature or anything. Yeardley Smith (now best known as Lisa Simpson) plays torturingly annoying Connie who is supposed to be that way and man is she ever. She is one half of the Newlywed team stuck in the station and her voice is like nails on a chalk board. She's the damsel in distress type and Smith does play the role I think it was supposed to be so kudos to her I suppose. John Short is her new husband, Curtis. I would have liked to have seen more from his character as he does turn out a rather heroic performance and he's kind of underused compared to the other characters and I think he has a really good character and could have pulled off more to it.Most horror fans really do appreciate a good campy flick and that is exactly what Maximum Overdrive is. I mean you can't help but laugh in horror as all these electrical appliances start murdering people everywhere and these massive transport trucks stage a revolution against this tiny gas bar with these people inside. The kills are plenty gruesome and you almost start to see personality in the various trucks especially the Goblin truck which appears to be the leader of this crew. Somehow the story really does make you feel like these things have individual personalities and you start to feel the claustrophobia that comes from a Stephen King story but it won't ever freak you out because the film is completely laughable and darkly comic but you know I would watch it again because it doesn't try to be anything but. King really didn't do anything spectacular with this one and only directing debut. I mean you can see a little of his style but I think Mick Garris has captured more King style than this film does. I still would love to King come back to the helm for something he is passionate about but until then we can enjoy and laugh off this eighties cult classic. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Will always be a classic to me","Date":"21 February 2008","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Horror","Review":" I liked this movie from the start.

Because of this, machines begin to act violently and want nothing more than to kill, maim, destroy, eliminate, and eradicate those that made them. The movie never tries to take itself seriously, but my problem is that humor is not something you can just snap your fingers and manufacture. This is just not very funny. It was also quite boring. The worst part was the first fifteen minutes or so where we get exposition as to what is happening, meet all our unlikable, thinly-layered characters, and see King in a stupid cameo at an ATM. Really? At any rate I could go on and on about what is wrong with this picture. Look at the other reviews if you want to explore all that. It is mountainous! One major problem is that King, a writer who should have known better, tries to stretch a short story beyond its stretching point. This is just not substantial material for a feature-length film. Secondly, the whole film seems to lack and desperately need a sense of direction. I felt bad for some of the actors. Some are decent like Pat Hingle, yet he was chewing up scenery with an ALIEN-like mouth. It was too much. Most of the other actors are not very seasoned or good. Thank God for Yeardley Smith(the voice of Lisa Simpson herself). Without her I cannot imagine what watching this would have been like. She is about all the only real humor in the entire film.

It's not a comedy, but there are some great little scenes that should make you laugh out loud.The action focuses on a group of people stuck at a truck stop, hemmed in by a collection of articulated lorries/trucks that have come to life. Can they survive the onslaught of the machines, or will they be picked off one by one? You know the answer already; some live, some die.Nearly all the action takes place in a Truck Stop, which is large enough to give the trucks room to manoeuvre, but still locks the humans into a small, claustrophobic building. And for me, the fact that a lot of the action takes place during daylight is a great plus. There's none of the constant jump shots that modern horror films rely on to scare the audience. Instead, this film says, this is happening, what would you do, and then gives you time and space to imagine your own machines turning against you. If that doesn't give you pause for thought and make you a bit edgy, then you've not thought hard enough about the damage all the machines near you could do to your fragile body.Whilst there's deaths aplenty, few of them involve on-screen guts and gore, it's more a case of discovering bloody bodies than splattering the camera. Most of the deaths that do happen on screen are at a medium distance, or have no blood visible at the moment of death. By the standards of the 21st Century the violence, language nudity etc. is very tame - to the point that I'd let any teenager watch this.Of course, there's no explanation of how the machines can sense anything, how they can communicate in Morse code, how they can coordinate their actions, what's controlling the machines, but that helps with the whole claustrophobic feeling and confusion felt by the humans.However, it's the humour in the film that lifts it above the average horror film and makes the film watchable. From the opening scene with the A**hole ATM, through the boy crushed under a steamroller, the freaky Green Goblin toy truck, death by melons and the squashed shoe, there are lots of little moments to cherish.And then there's the soundtrack from AC/DC - perfection.Yes, the film could be better. Some of the actors are unable to bring their characters to life, but there are enough people on form to make the movie work. Given how good Stephen King is at creating a character in 100 words or less, it's a shame that he couldn't bring all of the characters to life as the director of this film.So it's not a great film, but it is very entertaining.

It is about a mysterious meteorite or asteroid (I'm actually not 100% sure which or how) that passed close to earth and then somehow infects or takes over every electrical appliance and machine on the planet.Suddenly, blenders and toasters start attacking people. Pop machines start shooting cans out of their slots like machine guns, mowing people down. Worst of all, all the world's cars and trucks start circling human survivors like sharks, just waiting for their chance to attack and finish them off.Sound stupid enough? The thing is, sometimes the stupidest movies are the most fun, and this movie is definitely fun. The pop machine scene I was describing made everyone in the room laugh so hard that we had to stop the movie and back it up. And when this kind of ridiculousness is intentional (in this case I am certain that it is) it deserves some credit.Emilio Estevez stars, it's one of the campiest and most fun things Steven King has ever written, and the soundtrack by AC/DC featuring Who Made Who is awesome. Well, as long as you like AC/DC, which we certainly did.Check it out if you like horror comedy. It's a lot of fun with some cool and hilarious deaths. "},{"Title":"Great Fun!!

Where else will you see a tyke mowed down by a steamroller? Or see soda cans become lethal weapons? Scripted by the author himself, based on his short story Trucks, it explains its premise of Machine vs. Man by having planet Earth drift into the tail of a comet, which causes most machinery to declare war on humankind. Some of the characters are broadly played and hysterically funny. Most of the actors play it straight faced, especially Emilio Estevez as young hero Bill, but old pro Pat Hingle camps it up something fierce - and is a total hoot - as white trash human antagonist Mr. Hendershot. Christopher Murney as horny Bible salesman Camp Loman and Ellen McElduff as waitress Wanda June have their hammy moments as well. King never, ever shies away from the red stuff, and puts as many gags into this thing as he can - a person killed by a walkman (remember those?), a dog killed by a toy car, etc. He doesn't bother with it making too much sense (such as the honeymooning couple whose car never turns on them), and just encourages us to go with the macabre fun of this endearingly ridiculous enterprise. Other worthy elements include legendary rock band AC/DC's only attempt to date at film scoring, providing some of their big hits and some new tunes and incidental music to the soundtrack. Other inspired musical choices are the uses of Roger Miller's King of the Road and Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries. In addition to the aforementioned actors, we get Laura Harrington as tough sexy hitchhiker Brett, Yeardley Smith - Lisa Simpson herself! - as amusingly annoying, screechy newlywed Connie, a couple of solid character players like J.C. Quinn, Frankie Faison, Leon Rippy, and Giancarlo Esposito, plus none other than Marla Maples as one of the unlucky motorists in the grand opening bridge catastrophe. There's also the appeal of seeing our principal semi identifiable by having the face of Spider-Man's nemesis The Green Goblin out in front. Absolutely priceless lines of dialogue include Don't make me a widow on my wedding day, Curtis!, Yew want a war? Yew got one!, and Yew can't do this! WE MADE YEWWWW!!!! Now, if one can't appreciate the entertainment value of something so unabashedly dumb and raucous, then fine. But those of us who do love Maximum Overdrive love the Hell out of it, as it opens and ends with a bang. King himself makes a cameo appearance as the man at the ATM. Eight out of 10.

This is a cult classic as many have stated! This movie is no worse than Repo Man with Emilio Estevez that's considered a cult classic and has a much higher status. Regardless, I know what people think. Even my father and older brother laugh at me when I watch this movie, not because it's bad but because they say I burned them out on it when I was about 7 and they knew it line for line. Im 26 now, and this movie is still just as good! People tend to get too hung up or in-depth as to reasons why the machines become homicidal. Instead - just go with the flow and enjoy. Even though a reason is offered the first 20 seconds of the movie, people still want a logical explanation. King should be proud so many people love this movie and have such fond memories of it. Have you ever seen a lot of directorial debut efforts? Most come from director's that are fresh out of film school. Considering King jumped from author to director, he didn't do too bad at all - cocaine fueled duration or not.A group of people are stuck at a desolate truck stop, being held hostage by a mob of homicidal 18 wheelers that operate themselves and are thirsty for human blood. How can you not like the Green Goblin truck who is obviously the leader? It's not often you get to see semi's with trailers running over people at high speeds, steam rollers crushing kids, bulldozers, vending machines, electric knives, and more operating themselves in such a fun manner.Granted this isn't King's typical character driven, suspenseful plot - it's just plain fun. The cast is great. Emilio Estevez (after The Outsiders & Repo Man, before Wisdom), Pat Hingle (the asshole boss we all want to die with tons of one liners), & Yeardley Smith aka Lisa Simpson herself. The cast has a lot of inner turmoil, but in my opinion take a backseat to the machines who are the real stars.Regardless, this has been beaten to death in reviews and argued about, it all boils down to opinion, most say it's a guilty pleasure - I say it's a childhood gem that still holds up to this day!

I came in knowing the movie wasn't all that serious.Campy or not, of all the vehicles picked to terrorize a truck stop, trucks were actually the worst choice, with their poor maneuverability and slow acceleration. After the people got a clue what was going on, they should have had many openings to dodge among the circling rigs and run for cover. Those who succumbed seem to have no hearing or peripheral vision, and they kicked out a lot of blood for low speed crashes!Pickup trucks or agile cars might have actually been something to fear, but that leads to another flaw; if you have a whole cache of weapons in the basement, the first logical thing is to shoot out all the tires and/or fuel tanks. And, if among those weapons is a rocket launcher, and you've already killed several trucks with it, why not just blow them ALL up? The piecemeal actions didn't make much sense.I mainly kept watching because a couple of the girls were shapely, and because I generally like Stephen King's stuff. I think the best Stephen King movie (not directed by him) was The Mist (2007). It was one of those rare films that matched the suspense of the story it came from, though the ending could have been less depressing.

He wanted to create a film that was intentionally bad, cheesy and entertaining. Mr. King somewhat produced a film like the one he envisioned. Too bad the end results don't click together like they did on paper. Taking a short story that he written during the seventies called Trucks, Mr. King took the bare basics of that story and made it into a major motion picture, bank rolled by his friends at De Laurentis Productions (who seemed to be putting out a movie based on Stephen King's works every other month) it had all the makings of a block buster smash. It did not.The movie takes place during a few days of an amazing cosmic event. A comet sweeps by Earth covering the planet with space dust. When the dust settles, the machines have come to life and revolt against man. Humans are running for their lives as the machines have seemingly taken over. Only a few survives have managed to make it to a truck stop diner. But when they've arrived, the diner is surrounded by hundreds of diesel big rigs. After plotting strategies for a few days, the survivors , make a run for the local docks and head towards a nearby island to wait out the rampaging machines. Lo and behold, after a few days a Soviey Spy Satellite discovers a low flying alien spaceship and destroy it ending the several days of terror.Why did I give away the movie? Because so many people have trashed it. Stephen King wanted to create a comic book style movie filled with science fiction and horror elements. He succeeded for the most part. But there's something missing from the final product. The acting is pretty weak and the censors cut out a lot of blood and gore from the film. Too bad it wasn't released like that because it could have been something real cool. The music by A.C./D.C. was appropriate for a film like this. Stephen King should have made a few more films.

The bridge raising, the scene at the baseball game in the park and the aftermath witnessed in the suburban neighborhood all come together to give this one a pretty dark opening that sets up the peculiar nature of their behavior here very nicely. That leads into the best aspect of this one, which is the action found within this one as there's a lot of exciting scenes that really have a lot of action here. The truck chase from the abandoned rest-stop along through the highway is great fun, the attempt to pierce their ranks and get inside the compound and the numerous rescue attempts to get around their imprisonment make for some wholly good times here as there's so much going on that the film features a great pace as a result. There's also a lot of great fun in the finale race to the island as there's a lot of action, plenty of explosions and chasing as well as some cool deaths thrown into the mix that really makes this one end on a high note that gives it more than enough to overcome the few flaws in here. The most obvious one is the sheer inability to believe that there's a week of time that transpires in here for the trucks would've had an easy time of it smashing into the facility to get at them. That they go to sleep is the most obvious time to attack, yet all they do is circle the compound and utilize their stupidity to get them, which is another problem here with this one. Likewise, the fact that this one is unclear about why the married couples' car was unaffected, despite everyone else's car being possessed and controlled does come up yet is never really answered. Lastly, the fact that this one does slow-down slightly in the middle when they become trapped there does show-up as the pacing suffers when it's like that. Otherwise, this one was a pretty underrated and enjoyable effort.Rated R Graphic Violence and some Language.

Really Sci-Fi instead of horror though, which I much prefer anyhow. I grew up in the 60s, 70s & 80s (a bit slow to mature, I know) and this was just a great nostalgia hit. It was not at all a movie so bad, it's good. It really is good, dumb, fun. Being a car guy, I especially loved seeing the cars from my youth (they were actually lame, strangled, cars performance-wise, but they had character, unlike almost all of our current mechanically near-perfect transportation blobs). This film also confirms my feeling that in general people themselves really were better back in my youth (at least one study indicated that Americans reached peak niceness around this time or maybe a bit earlier)--it's just reflected in the characters and overall tone of the movie. I often wonder if today's kids are ever going to be feeling any real nostalgia when they get older, given all their bizarre over-scheduling and over-stimulation in our accelerated, explicit, hyper-competitive, hyper-aggressive, immediate-gratification society (hang on a second--the latest mass killing on the TV is distracting me, and, Hey you kids, get off my lawn!)-- I just don't see much innocence in my friends' kids nowadays. Back on track, I also loved the AC/DC soundtrack--I didn't know those songs came from this movie and now the lyrics make perfect sense. If you are around my age, I think there's a decent chance you'll like this movie for the same reasons I did--just a fun nostalgia ride with a workable plot and acceptable acting. For me, tonight at least, it's a ten.

Maximum Overdrive is based on his short story called Trucks and stars Emilio Estevez as Bill Robinson, a short order cook at a truck stop who must save the day from a bunch of evil self driving big rigs.A comet passing by Earth triggers machines to start going haywire. Pop machines shooting lethal cans of pop, Lawn mowers running amok and big trucks out to kill. Yes it's just as ridiculous as it sounds. All played to several songs by AC/DC. The comet is said to remain in the Earths atmosphere for eight days, but will humanity survive? The never ending battle between man and machine is resumed. To quote the waitress We made you, we made you! This is an appalling stupid movie but works as a sort of trashy fun entertainment. The events take place at the Dixie Boy Truck stop in Willmington, North Carolina, and has its share of stereo typical southern characters. The cigar chomping owner who calls everyone Bubba. The slightly retarded grease monkey attendant. There is also the story of an annoying just married couple and a twelve year old little leaguer. There are several characters that I assume came from the short story, but on film they seem quite one dimensional. Estevez does his best with the material but its quite the step down from the previous year of 1985 when he broke out with The Breakfast Club and St. Elmo's Fire. I'm sure he got paid and I don't blame him for cashing in on his new found celebrity.With the Stephen King name this movie gets instant recognition but viewer beware. Surprisingly it's unavailable from Netflix as the DVD is out of print. Although if you still really want to see it go over to Amazon On Demand.

With the passing of Hailey's Comet in the good ole year of 1986, something has causes all kinds of machinery to go haywire and become machines of death. Drawbridges open of their own accord, drink vendors start spewing cans out continuously, lawn mowers start running down kids. Even ATM's are offending open mouthed customers with some blasphemy. As in these situation movies, we end up at a permanent place of location, where a score of people hold out in this servo, manned by a lot of ex parolee cons, and owned by a fat old heartless and ill mannered pig of a guy, who's cheating the ex cons, by adding more hours to their work schedule, where they're really in no position to fight this guy, on the count of ending back in the clink. MO is trashy great fun, but in no way a good film. The film does have a lot of good performances, Ellen Mcduff, Pat Hingle, Harrington too, as the tomboy pickup chick, who a dirty old reverend, tries to have his way with. Lead Estevez, (Razzie nominee here) as one of the cons, who really sticks it to Hingle near the end with an awesome line of dialogue, seems out of his element. I've seen better work from him. This flick is just something to watch, sit back, kick your feet up. It's just such trashy fun. Trucks that circle the station, have never been scarier, and the film does successfully maintain a terror, and scary ambiance of nastiness from it's machines. In some ways, especially the end, where it draws an all too similar parallel, it's very much like the Dawn Of The Dead remake. And like that too, we have heroes, nice people, and a..holes. One of the most trashiest flicks of 86, that can only be remembered for that, where it's bloody guilty fun too.

He criticized other directors for not doing a competent job in executing his stories. He made this movie to prove he could do a better job than the directors he trashed. To make matters worse he wouldn't take responsibility for this disaster of a movie. He even went as far to claim that he set out to make a bad movie. Take what you want from all that. The problem with this movie to begin with is none of the characters are very likable so you have a hard time rooting for any of the human beings. Also this movie can't play by it's own rules. Trucks and Machines running a muck but somehow the newlyweds can still manage to control their own car as well as a few of the other characters. Some of Stephen Kings stories can be a recipe for a good movie this one isn't one of them. A movie called Trucks came out in the 90's based on this same story isn't much better. Saving grace is AC/DC does the soundtrack which gives this a boost. And because this movie blew up in Stephen King's face we don't have to be subjected to him making any more movies like this or hear him trash reputable directors like Stanley Kubrick.

Saying this is a Stephen King movie, you would probably be expecting a macabre movie, but nope, instead you get a lot of trucks, after all it's loosely based on his short story Trucks!, and electronics that just want to kill and a really hilarious and enjoyable movie. The explosions look real nice and some of the kills, the steamroller and the kid as a great example, are just great to look at. For lack of better words there's basically no intricate plot, the characters are a little weak, but it still entertains.

Not because he's got tremendous talent behind the camera but instead because he could have delivered so many more, campy, non-sense movies. MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE is as bad as it's reputation would have you believe but at the same time it enters the so bad it's good range because of how silly it all is. Based on King's short story 'Trucks,' what basically happens is a group of people are stranded inside a truck stop as the trucks outside start to take over the world and go on a killing rampage. This is the type of bad film that everyone should really check out because it's amazing to see how poorly the final product turned out to be. In recent years King has admitted that he didn't know what he was doing and that he was snorting cocaine at the time and perhaps this is why everything here doesn't make since. I think the original story has some major logic flaws but perhaps King just didn't explain them well enough here. I still think there are some very campy and outrageous moments that make this worth viewing and most of them happen early on as the machines start to come to life. There's a coke machine death sequence, which is just priceless and campy. Then we have a steam roller death, which I'm sure looked wonderful before the MPAA got a hold of it. While watching the film I kept wondering if there was any sort of point to any of this. The movie has a very bad pace and it really just seems to go on and on without anyone knowing where to stop it. I think taking out ten or so minutes probably would have also helped it. Seeing people like Emilio Estevez and Pat Hingle adds some charm but the majority of the characters are just annoying.

A majority of the film takes place in Wilmington, NC at The Dixie Boy truck stop. Bill (Estevez) works as a cook at the truck stop who tries to keep his customers and friends close as this all happens.The film reminds me of Tremors for many reasons; it's set in a sleepy town in a desert like area, the things attacked are just out of this world, and the townspeople are similar to those in Tremors. Thats all good with me. Tremors is one of my favorite films.Maximum Overdrive is now considered comedy-horror instead of straight up horror. I disagree. I did find some moments of Max. O genuinely creepy. Despite all the hate it's getting online, it's a great popcorn flick. Doesn't live up to King masterpiece films like Christine or Stand By Me, but it's up there.Starring Emilio Estevez, Pat Hingle, Laura Harrington, and Yeardley Smith. Directed by Stephen King.

At times it also seems like this movie was more going with approach but at others it was just being plain lame and silly, when the movie was trying to more like a typical- and serious genre attempt.They should had known better really. I mean, when was the first or last time you ever saw a good enough genre movie like this one. It's basically being one of those old fashioned B-horrors in which giant creatures turn against humans, with as an only difference that the creatures in this movie are being replaced by large trucks and some other smaller and far more insignificant machinery.The story really doesn't ever make that much sense and it just gets used as a poor excuse to have some big trucks driving around, scaring and killing some people. This might actually still sound kind of cool to some people but believe me, this movie just isn't so at all. And the main problem of this movie perhaps isn't being the fact that it just has a weak story, in which nothing gets explained believable enough but more with the fact that the movie is such an incredible ineffective one.There is just never really any sense of danger within this movie. It never seems likely or scary that they can't escape these trucks. I mean, these trucks are incredibly large (American style), which also means that they aren't exactly very nimble and you can literally hear and see them coming from miles away. why not bring more machinery to live in this movie, who have a go at our 'heroes'. The things that come to live within this movie seem all very random and it seems even more random that they turn against humans and try to kill them in every way possible. Why not exploit your own concept to the fullest. Just seems to me that most people who were involved had no idea what to do with this movie, including its cast members as well.The deaths are also being the worst. First of all, the movie is using some horrendous slow-motion at times, which actually only helps to make it more obvious how lame and cheap this movie is looking. And secondly, most killings aren't even shown. Lots of dead people are lying around and it's just highly improbably that all of them got killed because some type of machinery went berserk. All of the 'dangers' shown in this movie seem to be something you can easily run away from, or at times even take one step to the side to avoid getting killed or even hurt, so how is it possible that so many people got killed all of the sudden, at almost exactly the same time. But thirdly, it's also definitely true that some characters within this movie really do their best to get killed. They literally walk into a truck themselves, or they try to challenge some of the machines in an extremely dumb way.And yes, large blame for all of this can go to Stephen King, who beside writing the story, also attempted to have a go at directing a movie all by himself this time. It was the first and as of yet also the only time he ever did this, which should tell you enough already. It's a really sloppy made and directed movie, which isn't just due to its silly and simplistic story. The story flow is really lacking at times and so is any of the character development, or the directing of the actors. I still have no idea why the movie decided on following these persons, considering that the 'catostrofy' was happening to everybody on Earth, at the same time. Surely there could had been far more interesting places with far more interesting characters for this movie to take place.A typical genre-flick, that got poorly done and is one that you can easily do without.4/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Sit back and get ready for some fun","Date":"21 July 2010","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Horror","Review":" What is the clown-faced truck?

Emilio Sheen, Lisa Simpson, and Stevie-Nix-King head up the terrific cast in this brutal, haunting, and often sad story of man versus machine set in the future (about 2 weeks I think). Based on one of King's most famous works- Cujo, the film follows a weekend in the lives of a bunch of Hicks who are surrounded, tormented, and murdered by their favourite household appliances- microwaves, TVs, Big Blue Pleasure Devices, chair lifts, and of course staples. The main threat though comes from their cars, their motorbikes, their trucks, vans, and hover crafts. They all get stranded in a diner off Route 66, and in classic Night Of Lovely Dead style they argue and fight amongst themselves whilst trying to solve the main problem and escape the nightmare in one or three pieces.Emil Esteves is a loner, a truck driver who just happens to pull into the diner for a burger and a litre of coffee, and perhaps to make a deposit in the traps. He meets an assortment of locals, weirdos, and workers but soon after all Hades breaks loose. One customer is in trap 1, but when he tries to flush it gurgles speech at him. 'Honey, this la-vor-a-tory just called called me an ass hole!' he cries. It retaliates further by spewing forth what he had previously spewed forth in a glorious twist of irony. Soon people are being stabbed, crushed, decapitated, and victimised. This film has what idiots call the likability factor. In other words- you can like it. There isn't much of a story after the first 12 minutes as the final hour is just scenes of carnage accompanied by music by metal band ABBA. Occasionally Yardon Smith (From the Simpson Family programme) shrieks something unintelligibly which would usually make me want to cut out my eyes and replace them with some sort of larvae, but here it serves to increase the tension. With superb actings throughout, lots of killings, and plenty of naked action, this is one of the all time must sees.Best Scene When that weirdo looking freak (whoever he is he should never be allowed near another film again!) at the start trying to reason with a cash machine but it keeps calling him a twatbag!

In reality, Maximum Overdrive is one of the campiest, most fun horror flicks of the eighties. And, it's pretty easy to see that it was intentional when the first scene has an ATM calling Stephen King an asshole.The plot is pretty simple. The earth passes through the tail of a comet and, without warning, all of earth's machines take on a life of their own. Oh, and they are murderous. Can't forget that part. We never actually come into any realization as to why the machines are rebelling, I guess it's technically possible that there are invisible aliens that are driving the trucks around. The main story follows a group of people that are surrounded by circling semi-trucks inside a gas station. These include a pervy Bible salesman, newly wed couple, and a badass ex-con played by the Mighty Duckman himself, Emilio Estevez.Just look at the poster to get a sense of the overall awesomeness of the film. Yeah, I think it's a picture of a well-bearded Steve King breaking through a trailer holding strings attached to semi-trucks like he was the puppet master of so many marionettes. Then you've got Gordon Bombay holding an M16 like he's gone commando while standing next to the female lead.The characters are underdeveloped, the plot is so full of holes it's ridiculous, and the gore is fairly light, but dammit, this movie just works for me. It's such a ridiculous premise and the leads play it completely straight, ostensibly to give the terror some legitimacy. But the cheese that spews forth from Emilio playing a hard nosed ex-con taking on both shitty boss Pat Hingle (who is excellent by the way) and an onslaught of nefarious, sentient trucks is just amazing beyond words. If somebody pitched that movie to me, I would green light it faster than you can say Another Stakeout.At this point, let me go back and address the gore, and say that I have only seen the cut version - word is there is another print of the film that has all the kills in tact. I'm holding out hope that the infamous little kid run over by a steamroller kill gets even more awesome in the uncut version.I also want to discuss a little bit about, at least what I see as, the major plot holes. For instance, why are some machines controlled by the alien force, and some are not. Why does the force not just take over the newly weds car instead of trying to use a dump truck to squash them? It seems like it would be easier. We also know that the force is capable of taking over simpler machines, like guns (as is seen when the rolling machine gun acts as a sentry at the gas station), but in the final act all of our protagonists use guns in an attack against the truck menace. It boggles my mind! I'm assuming that someone of King's caliber recognized this and either didn't feel the need to address it, addressed it and it was cut, or just didn't give a damn.But, the fact of the matter is that none of these flaws make me like the film any less. In fact, I think they are kind of endearing. In reality, I should think that this movie is pretty shitty, and maybe it is, but I happen to think it's awesome.

I was able to watch it with them because my sister is cool like that and man, i was blown away watching my first horror movie.Getting down to the actual movie. I used to be a fan of this movie when i was little. It's about Billy (Estevez) and a group of employees working at a gas station. One day the earth passes by a comet and causes machines to go into Maximum Overdrive. Soon we meet people in North Carolina that start stopping by the Gas Station called the Dixie Boy, where Billy and the gang works, like Brett and Curtis and his annoying wife. While at the gas station the crew are forced to stay inside while the machines surround them and would kill anyone who tries to escape.It's not the best horror movie ever but definitely not the worst. I give it 8 stars because it's a horror movie but it's also a comedy in some ways. I recommend the movie for people who are looking for a movie thats fresh.

Back then, being 9 years old, I thought it was the scariest movie I had ever seen, whenever I'd see a diesel truck I'd feel intimidated, however now at 26 years old, those old feelings have passed. This is a movie that you either love or hate. I really don't see it as a horror movie now, but maybe just as a gory comedy. I can't help but to laugh at some scenes, especially with Curtis and Connie, but it's not a movie that puts any kind of fright into you. I sometimes wonder how it would have turned out, had John Carpenter directed it, since he did an excellent job with Stephen King's Christine, but I guess we'll never know. I haven't seen the T.V. version called Trucks, yet, but I hear it's pretty bad. If anyone knows where I can find a copy of it, or if anyone knows which book Mr. King had the short story in, please let me know. As far as the acting, Emilio did an alright job, however I think they could have found a better actress for the role of Brett, I've seen Laura Harrington in other movies I thought she did a great job in, but she just didn't fit this part. Yeardly Smith and John Short do make a cute couple, and her accent and nagging gives the movie that little something extra to make you laugh. Pat Hingle as Mr. Hendershot did an excellent job, although I think Mr. Hendershot should have been creamed by one of the trucks, I didn't care for him at all. All in all I have to say this movie is good for us twisted minded people, seeing people run down, blood splattering all over, what more can ya ask for? Hopefully in another 10 years they'll have a remake of it, and maybe include the seconds of scenes they had to delete from the original, but this time add whatever it is that's missing that will make this a true horror movie. The Fog has been remade, The Amityville Horror, and a few others have been done, who knows what they'll make over next!

I'll acknowledge the fact that it suffers from a case of the stupids, but I had so much fun watching this. I easily can compare it to Dreamcatcher, which King had no direct involvement with- other than it being based on his novel; and think this is far superior. Dreamcatcher- the novel, is an incredibly over the top, hilarious book with some catchy one liners and an alien invasion launched out of somebody's a**S-hole! The film however, takes itself far to seriously, mutating something that could have been deliberately funny, into that dangerous area of being unintentionally funny... Maximum Overdrive, at no point- pretends to be anything other than it is and that's why I get a kick out of it.*Some spoilers herin* You know from the opening scene that this is not a horror film. King's cameo is hilarious and probably his best to date. And it has all of those wonderful King archetypes; the banding together of characters and story lines and your typical- suburban nightmare setting.There are some really fun and cool lines- such as Curtis, don't you make me a widow on my wedding day... And some cool scenes- like when the kid is riding on his bike and the sprinklers come to life behind him. He senses their presence and turns around, only for them to turn off.Camp, over the top, occasionally violent, off-your face action romp.

Granted, the opening of the movie is priceless, the first 20 minutes is hilarious, and then it slowly runs out of steam over the next half hour leaving the whole last half of the film with no fuel whatsoever - interesting note, this final half is the part of the film transcribed directly from its source material.Perhaps my problem lay in the fact that I really didn't care about the characters at all. Live, die, escape, or wind up with the short story's ending - I didn't care. Heck, I only tolerated these buffoons for the comedy aspect, but by the midpoint of the film that was tired and there's no way in hell I'm taking them seriously.Usually when a film is made from written material, I still find suspense in wondering how the filmmakers will execute the story. For Friedkin's version of the Exorcist, Scott's rendition of Black Hawk Down, and Coppola's take on the Godfather, sure I knew the ending going into it, but I still find myself leaning forward in my chair in anticipation of what came next. This also applies to every new viewing of these films that I've already seen. A film done correctly, never really loses that feeling. Sure, Bride of Frankenstein doesn't scare me, but I still find myself anxious to see the next moment of brilliance. As Maximum Overdrive starts to wind down, the readers of Night Shift know pretty much what will happen and how it will happen. With the comedic punch abandoning the empty ship, do I need to finish this paragraph and describe how I didn't care enough to want to see the rest? Not even a rewrite of the ending could renew my interest, not when my complaints are rooted as far back as the beginning of the film. Nothing could have renewed my interest, which leaves the great question of 'Why bother?' To which I break the laws of good English and answer, 'What the hell? Why not?' Whether or not Maximum Overdrive is a good movie isn't really a question worth pursuing despite some critics who make it a crusade to bash the film by taking it out of context in overly long reviews . . . as if you needed to take the movie out of context to bash it. The real question is 'How much of Maximum Overdrive can you tolerate before it gets old?' And for those film snobs who take cinema too seriously, don't bother with that question. Instead, I suggest reading John (Arrow in the Head) Fallon's review and take careful note of the all caps written specifically for you.

Every rational, film appreciating bone in my body tells me I should feel otherwise, but I just can't help it....I love Maximum Overdrive, and I'm not afraid to admit it.The story is weak, and the acting (aside from that of Emilio Estevez and a select few others) is even weaker, but I can't help but like the simplicity of this movie. It hearkens back to a simpler time when horror movies were a dime a dozen (seemingly being churned out at a rate of two to three new offerings per week) but at the same time you wanted to see every single one of 'em. It's what makes the 1980's the greatest decade for the horror film genre. The offerings were, for the most part, pretty darn good.Stephen King's Maximum Overdrive is no different. Although King may have originally been aiming for something on a grander scale (and he may have succeeded in doing so had his alleged cocaine-induced haze not have incapacitated him so), what he ended up with is something that distinguishes itself from the competition. A somewhat original story idea (although I believe the stuff about earth passing through the tail of a comet may have been lifted from George Romero's Night of the Living Dead) that involves a simple plot and basic character development, but excels in visuals and all-around entertainment.It's a fun movie, and it is just as much fun in 2010 as it is when I first saw it back in 1987.

It's a hunk of pure garbage, but I just couldn't stop laughing at it. I think this was completely made as a tongue-in-cheek comedy not as some sort of horror flick to be taken at all seriously. Most consider Stephen King, as director and writer, the equivalent of Ed Wood with this flick and it's insane premise about trucks and other various machinery running amok killing human beings once a mysterious comet surrounds the Earth. The film's main setting is a truck stop where a collection of workers, truckers, and other passersby are trapped inside the Dixie Boy while diesels circle awaiting some sort of command which later comes when a military jeep, equipped with a machine gun, makes it's way on the scene. The machine gun also serves as the jeep's eyes! Emilio Estevez is Bubba, an ex-con having to work overtime without getting paid extra thanks to Pat Hingle's sonofabitch boss at the Dixie Boy, Hendershot. Laura Harrington is a drifter heading to her family in Florida named Brett who falls for Bubba. Connie and Curtis(Yeardly Smith and John Short) are newlyweds who almost get crashed by a renegade diesel and find their way to the Dixie Boy. Ellen McElduff is waitress Wanda June, who never quite recovers her sanity with a mechanical knife attacks her. Holter Graham is the young kid, Deke whose dad was murdered by one of the trucks at Dixie Boy.The film is full of ridiculous gags such as a bible salesman who gets hit by a truck so hard, the camera pans back revealing his shoes..he was hit so hard the truck knocked him out of his shoes! You have a plane running on it's own as Ride of the Valkyries plays! You have a homicidal coke machine spitting out full cans which smash in the skull of the coach of a little league baseball team while other tykes get hammered as well. One poor kid, trying to escape on his bike, gets squashed by a steamroller, for crying out loud! The most memorable scene to me is when young Deke rodes his bike down a neighborhood where we witness the carnage of the machine attacks as bodies lay strewn all over the place with heads hanging out of windows, laying dead by their hammocks, legs sticking out of bushes, etc. Hell, there's even a dead dog with a toy mechanical car wedged in it's mouth! Somehow, Bubba will have to lead those capable enough to survive out of this difficult situation..perhaps a sewer tunnel system might be an option at their disposal.It's all played for shock value, nothing more or less. What's even more hilarious is when the trucks desire for the remaining survivors left to feed them gas! The damn jeep uses Morse code to communicate with them for petesake! Check your brains at the door for this one! Just see how King explains what might've actually caused the rampage..it's quite absurd really.

The machines target a select group at Dixie Boy Truck Stop. Bill Robinson (Estevez) is forced to rally his crew, to fight back against the machines, or they might be next. I picked this up on DVD years ago, because it was cheap. To be perfectly honest, I've never really cared for this movie. It's never boring, but it's far too brainless to truly enjoy. Most of the time, I can put my brain aside, but I couldn't in this movie. You'd think that evil vehicles wreaking havoc would be fun, right? Not really. This movie doesn't make much sense! There is not enough info for my liking! I wanted to know much more than what they gave us. There are many plot holes as well. Why did the trucks take almost 90 minutes to attack the diner inside the truck stop? I get that the trucks wanted to toy with the characters, but it was a really silly plot hole. Quite frankly, the characters that survived had no business doing so. I did enjoy the mind games from the machines, but it got incredibly stale after a while. The first half is actually rather fun. It begins with a chaotic scene on the bridge, and it's awesome! It cons you into thinking that you may have a good time. It's near the second half when things start to truly unravel. It started to drag and run out of tricks, to the point where I no longer cared anymore. Even the ACDC filled soundtrack begins to get boring. There is plenty of gore! These machines have a mean streak. Kids are killed in bloody fashion (Ouch!) Soda cans destroy people. People are run over by trucks in grisly fashion, and more! That Happy Toys Truck didn't play around. I hated most of the characters in this movie, except for two! Emilio Estevez has that boyish charm in spades! He's one of the characters that I sympathized with. He was a lot of fun and you know what you're getting with him. Pat Hingle plays the prick well, but he goes overboard with it! I got sick and tired of his Hey, Bubba! routine. Laura Harrington plays a likable love interest and I dug her for the most part. She felt like a real human being. Yeardley Smith is fine, but annoyed the crap out of me as Connie. Her nagging made me wanna smack her. John Short is OK, but not much more. Holter Graham is actually non-annoying as the kid! It's great to see a kid character that is enjoyable to watch. Stephen King did an average job of directing. He later admitted that he was really high on coke while directing this movie. Stephen King films are always a mixed bag. I'm pretty positive this movie is a reason Stephen King hasn't directed much since. It has moments that are enjoyable, especially the first half! It just grows increasingly sillier as it goes along and the fun begins to dissipate. Add in a few beers and that will help, but it isn't as fun as it sounds. 5.3/10 "}{"Title":"Plumbing the Depths of Stephen King Cinema","Date":"28 September 2014","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Horror","Review":" Disheartened by a score of sh!tty movies made from his catalogue of novels and short stories the coked up author cut a deal with Dino de Laurentis to direct Maximum Overdrive based on his short story Trucks.

When all this starts going down, several people take refuge at the Dixie Boy Truck Stop and try to ride this attack out. Little do they know that a bunch of semi-trucks operating on their own are on their way to the Dixie Boy and guard the area and make sure none of the people inside leave. After a while, they decide to concoct a counter measure and escape. The plot seems a little lame and the script is atrocious, but this movie doesn't disappoint or impress. If anything this movie is average, maybe a little below but it works. It can be classified in a few genres action, thriller, comedy, and maybe horror. The film has some subtle comedy, but where it is really funny is how incredibly bad it is. I think Stephen King, who wrote and directed Maximum Overdrive, knew that his screenplay was silly and over the top. Granted, he didn't intentionally want it to be horrible, but at this some of his books and short stories were already made into films so the audience knows what they are going to get with a Stephen King movie.Emilio Estevez is really the only big name in this film. He plays the parole grill cook Bill Robinson. His performance was decent considering the script and he delivers most of the one liners. Pat Hingle plays the truck shop owner who is selfish and morally insensitive. His performance could be described just like Estevez's, but way more over the top and annoying. There is also a two minute scene featuring a young Giancarlo Esposito, who you may know as Breaking Bad's' Gus Fring. Other than that, this cast is easily forgettable and full of undeveloped characters. It wouldn't be wrong to say that there would be a character you'd feel sad for if they died. The pace of the film moves pretty quickly and was a few exciting, good scenes. When the machines attack and the opening credit's bridge scenes are among my favorites in the film. Also the ending is kind of lame, but I will not spoil it. I'll leave that up to you to determine. I do like the fact the Stephen King wrote the short story, wrote a screenplay based on the story, and directed the film. It was nice to see the film through the eyes of talent like Mr. King. He also makes a cameo as well, a very funny one I might add. Being known for having a very creative mind, he really just makes this film based on a pretty generic idea. Really, how many movies have you seen about machines becoming self aware and operating on their own. But personally, I still like this idea. He took his idea from Christine and added a bunch of action and traded in the muscle car for a semi. alternate text Look out for the Goblin truck, he'll get ya!!Overall this film is far away from a great film, but not the worst I've seen. If one statement can describe this film it would be so bad it's good. I do think it is worth a viewing. It is a cult classic and you will always find it on cable. But it's definitely better if you watch the uncensored version. This is a fun movie and it has its moments, both good and bad, but it works. I don't think anyone will say they wasted their time with it. It has some cool scenes filled with action and comedy. Like I said, its not a masterpiece but its not downright horrible. Maximum Overdrive is just another ordinary Stephen King story twisted, gory, and thrilling.5 out of 10.

It didn't add up Stephen King had criticized most of the filmmakers who'd adapted his books, so it seemed logical to assume that HE would do better- that HE would show them Hollywood boys how to make a movie... MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE isn't the worst movie ever made- far from it- but now I understand why King referred to it as my moron movie. In the years since the film's release, he's admitted that he was coked out of my mind most of the time he was directing it. That explains a lot.

On Earth itself strange things begin happening, machines & electrical equipment start to turn sentient, almost alive like someone or something is controlling them. At first cash machines insult customers & bridges open & close on their own but soon the machines turns against humanity with cars & trucks running people down, electric carving knives slicing open anyone who ventures too near, vending machines that kill, video game machines that electrocute their players & even lawnmowers that cut up their owners. The Dixie Boy truck stop & Diner is attacked by a convoy of huge trucks that refuse to let the terrified people inside leave, as news of the outside events filter int the Dixie Boy it seems that the trucks have plans for the remaining humans. The trucks need fuel to run & make the few survivors fill their tanks which gives them enough time to work out a plan to escape...Stephen King's name attached to any sort of film seems to be worth money in Hollywood, the amount of his stories or books that have been adapted to the silver screen is testament to that & films with his name attached are still being made, both original works & remakes so he's as popular & well known now as he ever was. Of course he is one of the worlds best horror writers & recognisable names in the genre so why not? Unfortunately you could say that the works of Stephen King have fared reasonably well on the big screen, there's been the odd disaster but most are watchable enough with the odd classic thrown in but most are average. Realising this King opted to adapt his short story 'Trucks' & direct himself with uneven yet entertaining results. Maximum Overdrive is undoubtedly a silly film, some of the decisions the character's make are mind boggling while the story lends itself to some silly imagery & moments but somehow it works on a camp level. To be blunt, I liked Maximum Overdrive for what it is. From the coke vending machine that sends cans flying out with such force that it kills one guy to the opening scene where the cash machine calls a man played by King himself in an uncredited cameo an a hole to the gloriously bad taste moment when a huge steam roller runs over a ten year old kid there are many scenes & moments in Maximum Overdrive that will stay with you, it makes no great sense why some machines are affected & other's aren't while I refuse to believe a huge truck could 'creep' up on someone without them noticing it but again I think there's a real camp entertainment vale to be had here, any fan of junky films will love this. The character's are thin, there's not much of a story to get into but there's a definite watchability to it. At just under 100 minutes it has a good pace & doesn't feel that long which is good, I am sure there are many out there who hate Maximum Overdrive & that's fair enough but I liked it. Some of the dialogue is really bad, the scene set inside the Dixie Boy toilet when Emilio Estevez has to talk to a fat guy on a toilet taking a wet flatulent crap is quite surreal.Maximum Overdrive lacks any great imagination on King's part & the whole film is a little flat lacking in tension or urgency. Considering how skillful King is writing horror books it's surprising to see such a lack of depth to the character's & the really bad dialogue. There's some good special effects work here though, from exploding trucks to some decent gore a lot of which was cut to get an 'R' rating. Apparently King has admitted that he was high on cocaine the entire time he made Maximum Overdrive so that might explain the silliness & almost random feel. An accident on set occurred when the radio controlled lawnmower went haywire & struck a block of wood sending splinters flying & injuring the director of photography Armando Nannuzzi who ended up losing his right eye & ended up suing King for $18 million in damages.With a supposed budget of about $10,000,000 Maximum Overdrive has good production values & looks nice enough, filmed in Wilmington in North Carolina. Australian rock band AC/DC composed the music. The acting is suitably hammy & no-one seems to taking it too seriously.Maximum Overdrive is a film that I enjoyed, whether you enjoy it will depend on personal taste. It's one of those films that only certain people with certain viewing mentalities will get. Apparently Stephen King was asked why he has not directed anything since Maximum Overdrive he replied 'Just watch Maximum Overdrive' which is a quality come back. Certainly not for everyone but I enjoyed it.

King writes and directs the film, which he adapts from his own short story Trucks, and the results are extremely disastrous. And that's being generous. Purely on an entertainment level, this schlock-fest fails to deliver almost any memorable scenes amidst a cast of characters who are unlikable and occasionally outright stupid.The year is 1986, and the Earth is passing through the cosmic dust of a nearby asteroid. Suddenly, machines of all kinds, even ATM machines, are terrorizing humans everywhere. Steamrollers run over kids, lawnmowers eat up adults, and vending machines launch sodas into peoples' genitals and heads. Whilst this is taking place, a group of people becomes stranded at a desolate truck-stop in the middle of the desert, and the local semi-trucks aren't keen on letting them leave. It's do or die in this romp of, quite literally, man vs. machine, and it will be up to Bill Robinson (Emilio Estevez) to lead the group and blow the trucks to kingdom come.Maximum Overdrive stands as a testament on how NOT to make a movie. The premise is utterly laughable even for a science-fiction story. Unfortunately, King's story continually reminds us that while some writing works on paper, it doesn't necessarily work on celluloid. The characters, aside from Estevez, are inherently worthless and some of them bite the dust in such a way that we not only don't feel sorry for them, we cheer for their imminent death! A waitress even attempts to negotiate with a military cart with a mounted M-60 machine gun. I bet you can't guess what happens.The acting leaves so much to be desired. Stephen King himself is the first person to show up in the movie as a confused bystander operating an ATM machine just so it can call him an asshole. Perhaps King was self-aware when he made this drivel? Afterwards, idiot after idiot gets killed off, and none of them are endearing, funny, charming, or even remotely interesting. Estevez practically must hold the picture together by himself in a barren truck stop (thus making the film uninteresting to even look at, let alone seriously enjoy), and even some his line readings betray to us that he knows this film is a joke in of itself.The real crime this film commits though isn't its poor use of a great soundtrack by AC/DC. It is not the bad acting. It's not even the poorly written dialogue and situations. Through and through, Maximum Overdrive is boring to the core. Despite some impressive explosions and car crashes, it feels numbing and joyless rather than exhilarating and visceral. I continually kept looking at my watch to see when the film would finally end and I could go back to doing something worthwhile. When it finally ended, I wanted an hour and a half of my life back. Sad to say, that wont happen.Stephen King remains a viable storyteller as far as his novels go, but he should never be allowed to make another film or criticize a filmmaker for botching his stories. Needless to say, with searing irony, he has proved with Maximum Overdrive that he is far worse at adapting his own stories for the screen than directors like Kubrick, De Palma, or Cronenberg. And that is being generous. "},{"Title":"Why Stephen King Should Stick to Writing","Date":"25 February 2011","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Horror","Review":" Maximum Overdrive isn't a dreadful movie, but neither can it be considered any kind of classic as some reviewers have anointed. At best (or worst), it's just a slightly below average flick by a first-time director. It's only real draw is that it's Stephen King's directorial debut and swansong (or ugly duckling, depending on your viewpoint).If you haven't guessed, King took his classic short story Trucks and fleshed it out into a full-length movie. He also took the directorial reins for the only time.The movie deals with the after-effects of a comet that passes Earth, bathing the planet in its tail radiation for three days. As a result, trucks and other mechanical items come to life with deadly results. A group of survivors gather in a roadside diner as semis besiege them.Some have described the movie as tongue-in-cheek and some of the performances might make you think so. But, the movie, overall, tries hard to be dramatic and kills the humorous side of it early on.The problems here in the movie come mainly from King himself. If you've ever read his stories, he puts so much detail into them that the reader can not only believe them, but imagine that they are part of the tale. Of course, words often work better than pictures because we have to imagine what we're reading.In Maximum Overdrive, King adds in a lot of inconsistencies. Trucks come to life, but not cars. An M-60 not only shoots more bullets than it carries but somehow manages to swivel around on its own. Yet, no other gun in the movie fires on its own.Somehow we are supposed to believe that an electric knife can come to life and chase a waitress. A hairdryer can somehow choke a woman to death with its cord. A Walkman can kill a man by sending...what, a weak battery surge into his ears? King lets us down with his lack of believability, surprising from a man who terrorized us with a demonic dry cleaning press (The Mangler short story).The cast is not awful, but not great. Emilio Estevez as the hero is, well, just okay. Not particularly believable but he gives it some gusto. Yeardley Smith as one half of a married couple is hilarious and it's fun to listen to her, if only to hear shades of Lisa Simpson and other characters she did on shows like Herman's Head, Brothers and Dharma & Greg. Laura Harrington as Brett is so bland she blends in with the woodwork. Oddly, she dresses like Emilio's fellow Brat Packers. Pat Hingle is over-the-top (as usual), but after about 30 minutes you just want to kick his a**. The only person more annoying is waitress Wanda June (Ellen McEldruff), who actually makes you want to see her killed (not a spoiler alert since you know she has to buy it).Fortunately, a few supporting cast members liven things up a little. J.C. Quinn and Frankie Faison as truckers aren't around enough. Look for Leon Rippy (Saving Grace, Eight-Legged Freaks), Giancarlo Esposito (Do the Right Thing, Homicide Life on the Streets), the ever reliable stuntman/actor Dean Mumford and even Marla Maples before she added Trump. King himself has a cameo as a not-too-bright man at an ATM.The trucks here look fairly menacing (when you're not accidentally seeing their stunt drivers), the one with the Green Goblin exterior is especially terrifying. Unfortunately, when the trucks actually attack, it's sort of lackluster because the survivors become rather stupid. So, it seems more like the victims were just idiots instead of the trucks being homicidal. King tries but can't make the trucks as terrifying as he can in his story. He probably could have had he followed his own words. For example, in the story, a man makes a run for the diner and escapes the main truck. He staggers for the door only to have a smaller, faster moving van come from the side and knock him out of his shoes. Such a scene in this movie could have gone a long way in making it scarier.The action scenes are also so-so. While most of us try to figure out why Pat Hingle has an arsenal in the basement of the diner, the survivors don't really put that arsenal to good use. And when they do, it's hard not to laugh. Whether it's Hingle reloading and firing a LAW rocket launcher (a single-shot weapon) or waitress Wanda firing the same launcher almost straight up and having the rocket shoot straight out, it looks as if King thought a few explosions would liven up his dull script.Try as he might, King is totally out of his element. For whatever reason, he cannot re-create the suspense and terror of his short story. He can't impart the sense of foreboding or doom. That said, King does include a killer soundtrack with AC/DC, so you can score him one for that.In the end, we have characters we really don't care about fighting trucks that are about as terrifying as Tonka toys.It's easy to see why King never directed another film.

Soon afterwards, I learned it was also turned into a movie, so I just had to see it. And yes, I liked it. Years later, I came on here to discover most people consider this a bad pretty bad movie. Quite possibly so, as an 11-year-old kid's mind isn't exactly the most criticizing one. Since, in the meantime, a remake got made in 1997, called Trucks (which for some reason I never bothered to watch), I just decided to re-watch the first film again, followed by the remake (to compare things). That was a few years ago, but here's what all comments I found saved on my double bill experience...I still think it's funny that Maximum Overdrive is actually the one film Stephen King himself considers his worst adaptation, since he was the one directing it. After this movie he never wanted to direct again, or so I heard along the years. I guess he just didn't like the experience (or perhaps he couldn't handle the criticism?). A shame, really, because you can see on several occasions that Mr. King does have some directing skills. There are quite a few impressive shots and camera-angles to behold, and the cast never overacts. Seriously, people, Maximum Overdrive isn't really that bad. It's just a fun flick with a crazy premise (that everybody already knows by now, so I won't bother). It hums along nicely and provides entertainment, and there are far more 'bad' films out there that do worse than this. Now that I've re-watched it, I think it's funny how the ending shows a lot of similarities with the recent Dawn of the Dead re-make from 2004 (only that one didn't end as, uhm, happy as this one).Featuring a young Emilio Estevez looking dirty & cool. And some other faces you might recognize from 80's genre films. Lots of machinery going berserk and one very memorable roadkill sequence at the gas station. I honestly think you shouldn't mind all those complaining about this film. Read the short-story and then watch the movie. Don't take it all too serious (the ATM machine gag at the beginning of the film should already be an indication not to do so) and you're bound to have some fun with it.

It had two really great things going for it an extremely cool hard rock AC/DC soundtrack and a great idea for a story. I was then, and am still to some extent, thrilled with the idea and possibilities of machines coming to life. I watched this movie more times than I care to remember in my youth and always had great memories of it. In hindsight I believe there were two principle reasons 1. I was listening to the soundtrack and ignoring the movie, 2. I was a kid and I knew cr@p about good movies! *LOL* Looking back on 'Maximum Overdrive' today, it doesn't hold up very well at all. Among Stephen King films that have been adapted to the silver screen, this one is in the bottom third -- although it is vastly superior to garbage like 'Dreamcatcher.' It seems very heavily influenced by Richard Matheson's 'Duel' -- not necessarily a bad thing but also not offering much new to the 'man versus machine' theme. It's strength for me is nostalgia but there are plenty of reasons not to like this movie. Here are a few 1. Yeardley Smith. She's dreadful here in what is easily the worst performance of her entire career. Picture an extremely aggravating Lisa Simpson screaming non-stop for 45 minutes. If you haven't plucked out your eyes and run screaming to drown yourself in the nearest lake, congratulations. And my condolences. She manages to be so aggravating that every scene she appears in severely damages the film. If you haven't watched 'Maximum Overdrive' yet then proceed by all means. Do yourself a serious favour though and put the TV on mute every time you see her on screen.2. The scares. In this film, King is generally successful when characters are trying to move from Point A to Point B without being wiped out by big trucks. The way he develops tension there is actually fairly competent. Why then he badly cuts his own tension to shreds by 'augmenting' any potential 'scary' scene with an electronica Bernard Herrmann 'Psycho shower scene' score is beyond me. It makes scenes absolutely comical. They were cool when I was a child. Now they're laughable, cheap and derivative.3. The Direction and Writing. I'm a big fan of Stephen King's early work but this just doesn't seem to work. The characters seem like caricatures hypocritical bible salesman, grill cook who's a repentant ex-con, Snidely Whiplash styled restaurant owner, tough chick who hitchhikes but can take care of herself, aggravatingly saccharine newly-wed couple, kid who is smarter than all of the adults, and on and on and on. If given the choice between being punched repeatedly in the groin or meeting several of the characters from 'Maximum Overdrive,' I can quite cheerfully choose the groin punches. Please and thank you. That so many of the performances seem adrift makes me wonder how much guidance King was able to give them. A failure to reign in Yeardley Smith et al and to help some of the other characters and performances develop makes it feel like nobody was in charge. In fairness to Stephen King this WAS his first film. That doesn't mean it was good. Or likable. Or enjoyable.Even with my criticisms and misgivings though, 'Maximum Overdrive' is a film that I'll find myself returning to from time to time. The soundtrack is perfect for the movie and is one of my favorite's. AC/DC do a great job. King has left the directing of his movie adaptations to others and that was probably a wise decision to make. Bad though this is, I stand by my original point that the ideas are really good. I wonder how it would do with remake treatment?

The film should be taken with a grain of salt but also should be studied in film classes and talked amongst film buffs for years to come. I adore this work of writer's art. Stephen stepped behind a camera instead of a typewriter to deliver yet another masterpiece. Highly Recommended. Even if you already saw it and hated it.

Over the long list of lousy adaptations King's work has attracted, this philosophy does make a little sense. However, the reality is that if you really want something done right on celluloid, you have to hire a director and/or screenwriter who can recognise the vision that the story deserves and put it on the screen. David Cronenberg proved that he could do this with The Dead Zone, whereas Maximum Overdrive shows that King himself might be able to write a great story, but making it work in a visual medium is another matter.The story, such as it is, concerns itself with the Earth passing through the tail of a comet. The effects of such an event are highly debatable, but one of King's strengths is that he can make the absurd or ridiculous seem like a matter of course. In Trucks, he focuses on making the characters' reactions sell the phenomenon. Here, visual effects, mostly of the simple trick photography variety, are employed. Incidents involving soft drink machines, steamrollers, video games, and a whole host of other devices are played out in literal detail. However, therein lies a bit of a problem with transferring the short story to the big screen.Trucks is just about entirely set at the truck stop, making the extraneous characters somewhat redundant. The fact that several characters drive to and from the truck stop is also a problem. One would logically assume that since the trucks are affected by the comet, so too would be sedans and any other passenger vehicle with an engine, would also be affected. The logic in the difference is never explained either in film or short story, but the short story has the luxury of never having raised the issue.In Trucks, the characters were a secondary consideration, and often little more than people to see the action through the eyes of. In the film version, they become the primary focus, and this is where the big problems start. Aside from a couple of sympathetic leads such as that played by Emilio Estevez, the cast of characters is more or less universally annoying. What's worse, after watching the film ten or a hundred times, one would be hard pressed to name four characters. Curtis only sticks out in the mind because of how annoyingly Yeardley Smith's character keeps yelling it.In the end, the film is shot down by the fact that it is not horrific or atmospheric enough to be a horror, but nor is it funny enough to be a comedy, in spite of some brave attempts. In the end, it is just mediocre, and that is something no film can be if it wants to be enjoyed. The only reason it has been remembered for this long, in spite of the distributor going out of business, is because of its association with one of the biggest-selling authors the printed press has ever known. If it did not have this selling point, it would probably have bankrupted the De Laurentiis group right then and there.In terms of a rating, the first reel is worth a ten. The massacre in the baseball park in particular is well-realised. When it gets to the truck stop, however, it is all downhill. Which is a terrible shame given the potential of its source material.

Maximum Overdrive was the first and last movie that King would direct to date. After watching the movie I now clearly understand why that has been the case. Maximum Overdrive is supposed to be taken as an action/horror movie but fails; in fact, it does a 180 and is basically considered a comedy by today's horror movie standards.Maximum Overdrive brings a lot to the table for better or for worse. From the beginning you see strange occurrences that are happening with different types of machinery acting up and taking on a life of their own due to Earth passing through the tail of a comet. Once alive, the machines begin to seek revenge on the human race for unexplained reasons. Emilio Estevez, playing the lead role, Bill Robinson, a cook at the local Dixie Boy truck stop. Emilio, best known for his part as the Jock in The Breakfast Club, sadly shows mediocre acting throughout this movie, especially in the lead role. Actually, just about all the acting in general was humorously horrible throughout the movie. The Dixie Boy truck stop is the main setting where the entire cast of characters end up meeting and decide to stay fortified from the murderous semi-truck posse circling the station where they are hiding out. This is when a lot of the movie starts to fall apart and not make any sense. For example a newly married couple's car is not affected by the comet tail and does not act violently towards the couple or any other living creature and can be driven with ease. In another scene the characters come across a vehicle that knows Morse code and is able to communicate with the characters in the truck stop. Mid-way through the movie, you almost want to start cheering the murderous machines on while they try to kill the characters inside the Dixie Boy. The characters are very obnoxious, annoying, and some are just down right predictable. Between the There are only a few thrilling moments throughout this movie when AC/DC comes in with some classic 80's instrumental background music. Also, when the characters fight back against the trucks that are trying to kill them with military grade weapons that have been stashed underneath the truck stop for who knows what reason.I do not recommend this movie if you plan on going into it with a serious mindset because it leaves you more confused at the end then it had you throughout the entire film. It skips all the details and just leaves you with the feeling of disappointment and complaint. But on the other hand, if you are going into this movie with humor in mind I definitely recommend it. Better yet, watching it with friends will add to the humor of making fun of this train wreck of a movie. Between the killer ice-cream trucks, video games, and demonic beverage machines, it's hard not to crack a few jokes.

So, he took one of his short stories and expanded it, unwisely, to a 98 minute length feature script and filmed it, in all its unwieldy glory... glory, I say, with that dose of sarcasm needed. Maximum Overdrive is total trash that's a blast to watch, and I almost would be more forgiving of it if it just wasn't so completely dumb-headed the whole way.The problem is not actually in the direction, oddly enough, but in the script itself, which is troubling for something that should be potentially *intentionally* awesome from King. It's like he cobbled together ideas from the likes of Chrstine and the Stand and the Mist and other works that we all know are just like this and added in trucks and rednecks to give it some flavor (perhaps it not set in Maine is is a saving grace I didn't really notice). He also peoples it with Emilio Estevez, Pat Hingle, Yeardley Smith, and a bunch of other actors you probably will NOT remember, or even care to, gives them some laughable (We MADE You!) and dead-pan-serious dialog that is not entirely laughable (really, did anyone laugh when Estevez made that Eat my shorts! line which was already dated when Bart Simpson said it?) And, finally, the trucks themselves, them like other random electrical devices directed by the rays of a wayward comet that will only be in the orbit, as we learn from the opening title card, for about 8 days, which have a logic that makes as much sense as a turtle solving a Rubik cube in two minutes. I wanted to get with what the trucks were all about in attacking as this random, evil force that comes only in King stories (well, not *only*, but most prominently in the last thirty years), but too long the trucks spend just circling around the diner at the gas station, like cowboys in a perpetual loop circling around a group of Indians, and by the time they crash through the diners me and my friends shouted in unison FINALLY! It goes without saying some of the stuff with said trucks, like the one with the Green Goblin on the front, was cool.But as with so much stuff in the picture, you only go with it for so long until you pretty much say alright, that's it, I give up. If it had been shorter, and this isn't just some 'it would work better as a 25 minute Twilight Zone episode' thing but it's close enough, like a Creepshow segment, it could be potentially amazing. But it takes too long to get where it's going, it retreads familiar ground, and only one or two moments actually POP with the kind of scariness that King himself promised in a direct-address to the audience where he proclaimed I'll scare the HELL out of you!

At a truck stop in North Carolina, a small group of survivors must find a way to get past the driverless trucks that have them trapped.Stephen King is one of the major players in the literary horror genre, writing dozens of books. Some of his novels have been turned into films, with mixed results. With Maximum Overdrive, King has decided to do the adaptation himself. While King has vast imagination that he pours onto the written page, it is strange that his script is full of clichés (the tyrannical truck stop owner, the heroic ex-con, his drifter girlfriend & the morally suspect Bible salesman) & bad dialogue. The script has a lot of plot holes &#150; why is it that some machines come to life & others don't? Or why the truck stop owner has a major weapons arsenal in his basement? The machine attacks are poorly handled, with King somehow deciding to play them over-the-top (the drawbridge scene is a case in point). The attacks are also unintentionally hilarious. The only good thing (besides the laughs) is the soundtrack, with rockers ACDC doing a real good job.

Well there's more campy laughs than scares in this; it's definitely not the horror writer's best outing.It looks like a cross between Duel and Night of the Living Dead. Trucks are animated by a rogue comet replacing the roaming zombie corpses in Living Dead which were re-animated the same way. The large 18-Wheelers roam the highways and truck stops looking for small cars and people to kill. Usually, both good and evil characters in King's stories are developed, sometimes even complex; here he lazily cranks out low-IQ stereotypes, many of which begin to grate on your nerves after a while. Some have Kill me! tattoos on their foreheads, and evoke no sympathy when it happens. Other movies like Tremors have worked the dumb victims approach better.The idea for the story wasn't bad, but the film is sloppy and weakly structured. Plot holes are numerous. Very little is done with the premise to be interesting. Wait'll you hear the cheap throw-away motive for the violent actions of the trucks.

Not exactly highbrow, it is considerably more entertaining that its rating score would indicate; especially if you can connect with the parody element.Written and directed by Stephen King on a very modest special effects budget, the story shifts between idyll small-town and redneck truck stop somewhere in North Carolina. A UFO has somehow gained control over most machines (insert Metropolis here) which proceed to slaughter a considerable number of people. Neither the film nor King's original story seem to have anything profound to say about aliens, humans, or machines. That is probably for the best as deep philosophy would only get in the way of the entertainment value of this thing.Like the farm house in Night of the Living Dead, those who remain alive take refuge in a nearby truck stop. Pat Hingle gives an over-the-top performance as the greedy owner who just happens to have a small arsenal of weapons concealed on the premises. Yeardley Smith as a stressed-out newlywed provides additional comic relief. Emilio Estavez and Laura Harrington provide the story's romantic element. Music is by King's favorite band AC/DC. Although everything from lawnmowers to blow dryers get into the act, most of the focus is on the eighteen-wheelers which besiege the truck stop around the clock. Then again, what do I know?

This is in terms of the confusion it almost inevitably generates with anyone who watches it. I am talking specifically about how and which machines attack people.For example, you may find yourself asking how could that soda machine really do that? Or, why do some vehicles chase after people while others are still obedient to their operators? Not to mention several scenes where a victim could have easily avoided being killed even if only four out of their five senses were working properly.Unfortunately, these aren't the only details overlooked in the movie. The text before the closing credits explaining what events supposedly happen later create more questions, including rehashing the whole why does this machine attack but not this one question.But beyond the lack of explanation and logic, there are other goofs that don't take a very keen eye to see. One involves an old Mack truck chasing a car and driving off an embankment to do the whole car-off-a-cliff exploding thing. This is cheesy enough, but, in this case, the truck seems to start exploding a little prematurely, not to mention the fall doesn't seem particularly far.Another point worth making is that Maximum Overdrive is not so much the scary variety of horror movie as it is the gory variety. So keep this in mind as well as the fact that pets and children aren't spared from the onslaught of King's machines.As far as the acting goes, it varies significantly by character, bordering somewhere along bearable and believable. Some of the comic relief is actually good.More on the plus side, the idea of machines coming alive and destroying humanity is thought-provoking to say the least, especially when one considers everyday appliances and automobiles attacking as opposed to more militaristic creations such as those in the Terminator films. Given the considerable expansion of technology that has occurred in our lives since this film was made, a modern adaptation could be very promising as long as some sort of logic behind what types of machines can attack is developed.Also, the AC/DC soundtrack really fits this film quite well.In the end, if you can stand the gore (I personally recommend watching a television version which is bad enough) and overlook or laugh at the fairly obvious absence of logic, this movie is worth a look. I couldn't bring myself to give it anything above a 4 but, hey, I couldn't bring myself to give it anything less.

Thus far, it has been his only effort in the director's chair, and it is likely to remain that way. The film has been almost universally panned, not only by the critical community, but also by many horror fans. The central concept, of vehicles coming to life and rebelling against their owners, made for a fairly entertaining short story (Trucks), but on film it just looks ridiculous. It is fortunate that King realized this; had he taken it seriously, the results would have been genuinely unwatchable. The film plays with tongue firmly planted in cheek; in the end it's not nearly as bad as expected. Quite silly, yes, but it's actually kind of fun if watched in the proper frame of mind. As a junk movie, it makes for some good late-night viewing, especially if watched in conjunction with mind-altering substances. Highlights include firing missiles at the renegade trucks, the amusing opening scenes (especially one involving a pop machine), and a montage of characters being forced to fill tanks to the tune of an A/C song. There are also some goofy bits with a bible salesman, demonstrating that King at least tried to have fun here.The acting tends to be fairly weak, since King paid more attention to the trucks than the cast. He didn't seem to put much effort into working with his actors; as a result the film's entertainment value sinks a notch, in this reviewer's opinion. Emilio Estevez has some appeal, but he is rarely encouraged to fully display his charisma. Laura Harrington delivers an ineffectual performance, not good for one whose character is the hero's love interest. In fact, when she was offscreen I pretty much forgot about her. Yeardley Smith, best known as the voice of Lisa Simpson, is irritating and deserved to be repeatedly run over. On the other hand, Holter Graham generates some sympathy as a young boy trying to survive the deadly machine onslaught. Other performers acquit themselves reasonably well as various rednecks and hicks. Stephen King himself has an uncredited cameo as a man confounded by the inexplicably foul language of an ATM machine.For a first time director, King doesn't do too badly, given the silly script he wrote himself. His writing style tends to be very visual in nature, and he successfully translates this characteristic, at least, to the silver screen. Given his lack of experience, he does a good job with his screen compositions, including some nice pans and crane shots. However, his pacing tends to be a bit off, especially in the middle. At least he usually makes it watchable. In the end, he was wise to give up directing for good, since his only film is proof that not even writers are experts in cinematically interpreting their own work.** (out of ****)Released by De Laurentiis Entertainment "}{"Title":"The Maximum Turkey.","Date":"14 August 2002","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Horror","Review":"  Totally stupid venture for first and currently only-time director Stephen King (yes, the novelist) as he makes a film based on his equally unappealing short story Trucks.

The first half is focused on gory deaths then the second half is more about the group fighting back and trying to escape.

With him behind the camera, the movie all but falls apart, with no real story and performances that fall flat.  This movie would have had more plot had it been directed by someone else.  However, despite its sheer awfulness, one good thing came out of this film the cool music of AC/DC.  Otherwise, this film would have been a turkey.1 out of 5 "},{"Title":"A Ridiculous Movie","Date":"3 May 2004","Score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Horror","Review":"  MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE takes stupidity to new depths . How dumb is this movie ? On a scale of one to ten it gets A+  that`s how dumb it isThe central plot revolves around the idea that an alien influence is possessing machines in order to rid the world of humanity . Yeah so it`s not documentary material but there`s worse ideas for a movie , but where everything falls apart is the internal continuity of what constitutes a  machine  , weather satellites and motorised boats don`t count but all cars do . Well not all cars because some characters are seen to drive them while other people are being killed by them , don`t ask me why this should be , and please don`t ask me how the cars and trucks are able to  see  human beings because I don`t have a clue either But what really yanked my chain was the lack of logic involved . We see a contraption with a machine gun mounted on it . How could that have been built ? There obviously must of been some metal work involved so do oxy-acelytyne torches and vices count as  machines  or is there some seriously ill thought out writing involved ? I also couldn`t help noticing people lying dead after being attacked by remote controlled toy cars and lawn mowers . Even if they were taken over by some unimaginable alien power a toy car wouldn`t possess enough potential or kinetic energy to travel hard enough to kill someone . Likewise a homicidal lawn mower could run over your toes but to kill someone seems unlikely Strangely for a Stephen King story ( Which he wrote so he can`t blame anyone except himself )  MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE is devoid of characterisation , the characters aren`t characters at all they`re cyphers just there to spout lines . There`s no character interaction and I had a problem remembering most of their names , in fact while watching the movie I forgot most of the characters existed until they got killed , that`s how much impression they made on me There are a couple of clever bits amongst the choking stupidity . If you look closely you can see one of the cards at the clocking on machine reads  Gene Poole  ( Geddit ? ) while I there`s an in-joke of having a van with the letters AC/DC ( The band who did the music for the movie ) crash around on a bridge but this is one of the most stupid movies from the last 20 years that doesn`t even begin to make sense  "}]
