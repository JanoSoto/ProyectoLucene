From the very start when the credits start rolling, the opening music seemed to fit perfectly; instead of the era-splitting noise they have hit us with in recent years. The old wartime, Bless 'em All and, Don't sit under the apple tree, heard in the background, as Dean Jagger, now a civilian, slowly takes a nostalgic walk out onto the weed-covered, oil-stained runway to remember gallant times of the 918th Bomb Group, now past. Gregory Peck as Brigadier General Frank Savage did great credit to this role, and deserved an Oscar. From the moment he enters the base and tears into the guard at the gate for casually waving him through, you know he's going to be a S.O.B. Dean Jagger as Major Stovall, the lawyer in uniform now Ground Executive Officer knows how to handle the paperwork after the first sobering face to face encounter with with Savage. That Jagger won the Oscar as best supporting actor, was well deserved indeed. Gary Merrill as Colonel Keith Davenport, the too popular Group CO, very good. Hugh Marlowe as Lt Colonel Ben Gately, who flew too many missions from behind a desk, placed on the rack by Savage with the other bomb group deadbeats and foul ups, handles his role well. Then their's Millard Mitchell as Major General Pritchard, displaying a commanding presence, and Paul Stewart as Doc Kaiser, also well portrayed. There are no false heroics in this movie. No blood and guts all over the silver screen. And no routine world war two, hard boiled, go-get-'em dialogue to spoil it. The authors, Sy Bartlett and Beirne Lay. wrote an excellent screenplay. They did the film a favour, they deleted General Savage's love interest that appeared in their fine novel. I don't think it would have added anything to the movie at all. Maybe what surprised a lot of moviegoers who had not read the book before seeing the movie, was Savage's mental breakdown; freezing suddenly at the hatch as he attempted to heave himself aboard the B-17. It was so unexpected of him after showing such ice-cold nerves What rounded out this impressive movie was the insertion of the air combat footage shot over Europe during the actual daylight operations. This documentary footage crowned a very fine achievement. One of Henry King's best; a professional effort indeed. The thread of sincerity in this war movie runs deep.The reason I found the movie so engrossing was, as a teenager, on the sidelines of the war, I saw more than one B-17 stagger home and belly in on a wing and a prayer. This movie was loaded with integrity from the beginning to the end credits. I'm sure the gallant gentlemen who flew with the Eighth Air Force over enemy-occupied Europe would be of the same opinion. It is a kind of monument to those warriors.

If you didn't know it, 'Twelve O'Clock High' was once many men's favourite war film of all time. How many people know about this now-obscure movie or realize the weight of its faded prestige, I  wouldn't like to guess. The number certainly decreases with each  generation. To  discover it on late night television, however, is the reward for the patient seeker of 'quintessentially American' films.'Twelve O'Clock High' is essentially the best depiction of a particular theatre of World War II--the extremely hazardous, aerial daylight bombing campaign over Germany. This film is the archetype for that entire lineage of war film. But it is memorable for its strong performances rather than well-directed battle scenes. In fact there are no battle scenes except for borrowed aerial combat footage. Yet few other films have the look of a 'big' WWII film better than this one--even though it is shot mostly indoors or in cramped cockpits.Gregory Peck plays an Air Force commander in England in 1943. His performance here is one of Hollywood's icons. Peck is at his best-- taut, controlled, and powerful;  flawless throughout every scene as a sensitive air commander forced to whip and browbeat a demoralized and resentful B-24 squadron back into peak efficiency. Peck runs roughshod over his new outfit, but he has a secret achille's heel--he fears he will grow too fond of the men he commands, the emotional link rendering him as ineffective as his predecessor (played by Gary Merrill).There are crisp, well-directed scenes where the stiff-necked Peck rides his men with extra fury in order to steel himself against all attachments. Yet as we and Peck learn by the end of the film, it is impossible. Despite Peck's best preventive measures, the squadron continues to suffer heavy casualties, and Peck, no matter how hard he resists, is drawn into an emotional attachment with the young pilots he must order into battle each morning. All soldiers know that comradery is the sharpest of double-edged swords during combat. You can never predict when you will lose a buddy--thus its a common practice for soldiers to keep their relationships light. This storyline has been treated loosely by a slew of later films, but never as successfully as it is done here. Every aspect of the emotional hazards of this type of wartime bond is fully dissected, and the film is filled with scenes containing extraordinary close-ups where the actor's facial expressions alone reveals the character's bitten-back response. This is especially gripping during the film's many vehement, man-to-man exchanges involving discipline, implied cowardice or dereliction of duty.In particular there are two wonderful subplots to the film look for the subtle interplay  between Peck and Gary Merrill (the brother officer Peck is forced to replace) with regard to the filling of someone else's shoes and an actual pair of flyer's boots that they borrow back and forth between them. Then there is another bit of business between Peck and a recalcitrant executive officer, Hugh O'Brian. The scenes between Peck and O'Brian, in particular, will almost make you wince, if you have ever in your life been chewed out by anyone or tried to 'measure up' to what you thought was expected of you.  The relationships between Peck and the other officers exposes issues about the choices men must make about each other and about their duty in wartime; and lays bare the emotions involved when they are forced to depend on one another; as well as what happens when they are forced to fail one another. Its simply outstanding. 'Twelve O'Clock High' stands quietly in the ranks of  the few really great American films, without any ego or hype.  If you can still  remember how important it can be to feel part of a team, even if it was only on a kickball or dodge-ball field that when you last had that feeling then you will admire this film. Dean Jagger won a Best Supporting Actor for his role as the reservist, and there are fine performances from every other actor as well. Millard Mitchell, an absolutely wonderful character actor, is without peer in a role he played often, that of a salty WWII general. And Peck, as we know, walks away with his role. If you have ever pondered  what the real meaning of over-used words like 'loyalty' and 'devotion' mean then this film is for you. The unfettered treatment of these hard-to-pin-down ideals is what makes it one of the few really great war films, for my money (yes, guys, sorry to say, its better than The Great Escape). When you are tired of watching the endless parade of smart slick and funny films, all filled with frivolous, stereotype-mocking characters, rent this one to see the real thing.

There are no weaknesses in this movie. The screenplay is perfect, rooted as it is in the historical reality of the U.S.'s attempt to prove the superiority of Daylight Precision Bombing over the Brits favored strategy of night bombing. The terrible human pressures it placed on young American pilots AND their leaders has never been so well-portrayed on film. Dramatic tension is perfectly manipulated, and the characters are well-drawn, sympathetic and fully developed. Every member of this superb cast gives this great material the great acting it deserves. The usage of actual WWII bombing footage adds to the sense of reality. The psychological drama - what maximum effort does to people - is at the core of the story and supercedes the mere military aspect. And the device of the framing scenes - Harvey Stovall (Dean Jagger) recollecting the story while standing in the abandoned airstrip - is brilliant. It gives the tale an overwhelmingly bittersweet feeling of long-ago  nostalgia. It is so powerful that Spielberg must have consciously had 12 O'clock High in mind when he used the same device in Saving Private Ryan to make that whole film a flashback, just as this one is. To hell with the flashy flamboyance of Citizen Kane; I would have to give 12 O'clock High a better shot at being the best movie ever made. Film buffs &/or devotees of WWII history who haven't seen this one are living a deprived existence.

In virtually every aspect except photography Twelve O'Clock High is superior. The script by Sy Bartlett in particular is vastly superior.Spielberg's film focused on some of the command problems faced by Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) in fulfilling his combat mission, but the treatment and development were almost high schoolish (if I may) compared to the enthralling delineation in Twelve O'Clock High. The problems encountered by Gregory Peck as the bomber group commander were complex, subtle and psychologically demanding, while the resolution was filled with the kind of male social and political dynamics not much explored at the movies these days.Director Henry King's clean, crisp, invisible direction was also superior to the uneven and far too showy pandering from Spielberg. Furthermore the acting, with Gary Merrill and Hugh Marlowe supporting Peck, was also better.Ted Danson in his cameo and Matt Damon at times in Saving Private Ryan were almost laughable. Comparing the two movies makes one wonder how much movies really have improved. Technically they have in every respect, but too often today's film-makers think they can get by with special effects and splashy sets. Pour a lot of blood, show a lot of skin, get people at each other's throat, and it will play, seems to be the attitude. What is often forgotten are the two most important aspects of film, namely, story and character development.In this respect I don't think today's films have improved on the great classics of the past.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

Watching it again I was equally impressed but I turned to this site with some trepidation fearing that a modern audience may find it slightly risible but I was delighted to read the many raves to which I now add my own. Several commentators have noted a thematic similarity with 'Command Decision' released one year prior to this but no one seems to have realized, or at least not mentioned, that these two movies paved the way for a spate of 'stress' type movies in the 50s, Paul Newman in 'The Rack', Tony Hopkins in 'Fear Strikes Out' (actually a true story of the Red Sox's Jim Piersall and his stress-related breakdown) and ironically Peck himself, some fifteen years later would deal with stress from the other side of the shrink's desk in his eponymous role in 'Captain Newman, MD'. But I digress; several commentators have also mentioned the framing device and again I'd like to endorse the positive comments. The movie opens in 1949 in a London street when civilian Dean Jagger leaves a London Hatters (looking remarkably like Bates in Jermyn Street) and after exchanging what seems like an innocuous bit of dialogue with two shop assistants but is really there to illustrate the difference between Americans and English, he goes on his way, stopping briefly to look at his reflection in a neighboring shop window and find himself face to face with a Toby Jug that clearly has vivid memories for him. Having purchased the Jug he is next seen cycling in the country and walking through an abandoned airfield. Although not essentially a visual film - because the talk is the important thing - helmer Henry King obtains a beautifully lyrical effect by leaving his camera on Jagger's face as the sound of airplane engines grows louder and louder and the grass begins to sway dramatically and all at once we are back in 1942 on an airfield at the heart of the still unproved, ergo still controversial 'daylight' bombing raids over Germany. Quickly, economically, we are made privy to the situation that prevails; the station has been having a lean spell, okay, they may be overworked but there are too many planes not making it back, too many elementary mistakes. Colonel Keith Davenport (Gary Merrill) is idolised by the crews not least because he flies nearly every mission himself and is clearly all but burned-out. Brigadier General Frank Savage (Gregory Peck) realizes as much in an informal conversation with his friend, Davenport, and passes on his misgivings to Major General Ben Pritchard (Millard Mitchell). Finding it difficult to believe Pritchard goes to see for himself and what he DOES see leads him to relieve Davenport of command and replace him with Savage. It's a thankless job for Savage, go in playing the heavy because the humane approach doesn't cut it in wartime. We've been here before a thousand times and we KNOW that in the end the martinet is going to crumble and win the love of the guys but as I've said before in these pages and will no doubt say again, it's all in the wrist. Peck, a fine and underrated actor gives arguably his greatest ever performance here, and he gave many great ones but in no sense does he 'carry' the film because he doesn't have to. EVERYONE involved, even Merrill and Marlowe, normally wooden actors, rise to the occasion and deliver career-best performances. Jagger's performance earned him a Best Supporting Actor Oscar and if he wasn't perhaps the Best Supporting Actor that year it is safe to say that there were none BETTER. Perhaps the most amazing thing about this film is that even now, some sixty years later when stress, combat fatigue, maximum effort, etc have long been identified as medical conditions we can still watch this film with first-time eyes and enjoy it to the full. 9/10 "},{"Title":"How did Gregory Peck do so many great films?","Date":"9 June 2005","Score":"33 out of 38 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, War","Review":" In writing reviews for IMDb, I have begun to notice just how many exceptional movies Gregory Peck did.

It is very similar to the excellent movie Command Decision, but goes deeper into the emotional and psychological cost of commanding the bombing campaign against Nazi Germany. Whereas Gable is all alone and hated in Command Decision, Peck goes a step further and actually goes on bombing runs with his men--only to become deeply scarred emotionally in the process. As a result, this movie is a fantastic look at the psychological effects of war--something that only rarely gets addressed in war movies.

It starred Gregory Peck as the Colonel, Frank Savage, head of the 918th Bomber Group assigned to making winged warfare succeed where his nice-guy predecessor, ably played as always by Gary Merrill, had failed. He is aided by brilliant Dean Jagger as Harvey Stovall his exec, his honest Boss Millard Mitchell, and others; but his chief opponent turns out to be the men themselves, not the Nazis...he has to completely turn their thinking around, make them write off survival and think only in terms of getting the job done--so they will have the best chance to maintain group integrity in the air. bomb their targets, and get home safely afterward. How he does this, by stalling their requests for transfer and winning them over to his way--the American way--of making war produces a powerful story. Others in the large, but uneven cast include capable Hugh Marlowe, John Kellogg, Bob Patten, Lawrence Dobkin, Joyce Mackenzie and many others credited and not. This epic was directed by veteran Henry King in what most believe is masterful fashion in B/W. Music was supplied by Alfred Newman and cinematography was done by Leon Shamroy. Art directors Maurice Ransford and Lyle Wheeler deserve every praise for the style they infused into the entire production, mixing actual war footage with their new scenes. Sets such as the large hut where missions are outlined, HQ House, the general's office, the bar, the now-overgrown airfield, the hospital and the airplane interior shots are all memorable achievements. The climax of the film is compromised a bit by changing the original storyline; instead of merely being unable to fly and watching his men get the job done without him, in the filmed version Savage has a near-breakdown from which he rouses only when his pilots begin arriving home. But there is so much power in this film and in its message that self-assertion is better than sloppiness, cowardice, inattention, non-cooperation, defeatism, et al, the film justifiably is still a well-beloved. Frequently, it provides an unforgettable look at how U.S.'s officers and men had to grow up as military operatives in the throes of WWII. To see the men in the film have to watch their Toby mug being turned around, signaling the beginning of another call to mission is moving; the film's opening, when having found the mug again in a shop, tourist Jagger takes it with him, climbs a fence into a field and finds the already-disappearing remains of the hardtracks down which B-17s had so recently roared, carrying the fight to the enemy and men to their deaths or heroisms or both--is frankly a classic sequence; it is also the scene which leads to the film being told as a flashback recounting the events of Savage's vital assignment.

From time to time-although,sadly,increasingly rarely as the years pass-I see groups of elderly men,often wearing windcheaters or old flying jackets,walking slowly but determinedly past King's College towards The Eagle,a town centre pub much favoured by aircrew during World War 2.These men,of an age group so often the target for disrespect and abuse in this country,are the rapidly dwindling survivors of the Mighty Eighth.Their tormentors neither know nor care that if it was not for them and many others like them they would in all probability be speaking German or Russian,depending on which of those two former allies ended up lording it over Europe.The English language would certainly have been verboten or speaking it a Niet - niet. After Pearl Harbour very few young Americans felt the European War had much to do with them.It had already been going on for over two years and Europe was notoriously unstable even in peacetime.The Pacific War,now that was a matter of national pride,why not let the English take care of the Nazis?But still these brave men set off for a cold damp impoverished country half a world away and flew across some of the most heavily-defended parts of Europe in broad daylight,a task the RAF had found far too dangerous day after day,suffering huge losses to be swindled in shops and laughed at in the country pubs.Their story deserves to be told and in Twelve o'clock high it is told magnificently. Nobody goes out and shoots down 6 Messerschmidts before breakfast,there are no idiots flying their planes under bridges,silk scarves trailing in the slipstream,bombing was a dirty,dangerous business and the men who flew the bombers were deadly serious about their business. With frightening casualty rates it was essential to maintain morale at the airbases,get the reputation as an Unlucky squadron and it could easily become a self-fulfilling prophecy. The responsibility for improving and maintaining morale rested on the shoulders of the C.O.In this case General Savage(Mr Gregory Peck). An early proponent of Zero Tolerance,Mr Peck believes that slackness and indiscipline in small areas begets slackness and indiscipline on a larger scale.This brings him in conflict with many of his junior officers.The daily struggle to maintain morale,inject discipline and continuously send other men to their deaths gradually takes its toll on General Savage and he eventually breaks down under the strain. That,reductio ad absurdam,is the story of Twelve o'clock High. But then,as somebody once said,Hamlet is just a story about a man who cannot make up his mind. I have seen this film many times.On one memorable occasion the BBC showed it during the Miners' Strike of 1974 with its attendant power cuts and the electricity was turned off just as General Savage was being introduced to his new flyers.I cursed Joe Gormley and all his works for weeks afterwards. Many of those young men who never made the trip home are remembered at the American War Cemetery at Madingley just outside Cambridge.If you go there and see a small group of old men standing rigidly to attention,their caps off,whisps of hair blowing in the cold Fenland wind,please spare them a silent prayer.

Video wasn't common then; so it was projected onto a screen, I remember, which was a bonus. I wasn't sure about management principles, but it went straight onto my ten greatest films list, where it remains. A few reasons why I think it's a great war film.Following the intro with Dean Jagger, the action gets off to a good start with the B17 crash landing, a man staggering out to vomit, a reference to a wounded man's brain being visible and an account of Bishop's bravery. This is strong stuff for 1949.It avoids a lot of war film clichés. There's no love interest (there's even a nod to the fact that the men weren't always faithful to their loved ones back home). There's no attempt to create a group of men who represent the breadth of society back home. You know the sort of thing - the New York cabbie, the young farm boy, the Texan, the idealistic schoolteacher, the journalist, the architect who's now bombing things that he once built. And it's about failure, it's about men destroying their bodies and their minds for something they don't understand. It reminds me of the colour-sergeant's reply to a soldier in Zulu, who asks 'Why us?'. 'Because we're 'ere, lad. Just us. Nobody else.' If I wanted to sound pretentious, I'd use the word 'existential'.It's about leadership and is similar to Nortwest Passage. Both Spencer Tracy in that film and Peck in this are aware that they are putting on an act. One of the great scenes is Peck arriving at the base. He's sitting in the front of the car. They stop and Peck offers his driver, whom he calls 'Ernie', a smoke. He thinks for a while, then grinds out his cigarette, says, 'Right, sergeant.' His driver snaps open the rear door and Peck becomes the general. Northwest Passage again - Tracy says 'I'm not a man now, I'm an officer responsible for men. If you meet me when I'm just a man, you might have to use a little charity.' Other nice touches the way the fur-lined RAF boots become the symbol of leadership. The way the real-life footage is dovetailed into the main action, a tribute to the war-time cameramen as much as the editor. Notice how they filmed detail like empty shells falling to the aircraft floor.So how could a film about military leadership help a local government manager, of all people. I couldn't bust people or demote them easily, rearrange their duties with a stroke of the pen. I would have loved to set up a leper colony, but the union wouldn't let me. But Peck's stressing of the need for pride in one's group is something that can be transferred to any walk of life.

It deals with its subject from a psychological viewpoint, with little direct action, but is nonetheless an absorbing and compelling film. Gregory Peck is magnificent as General Frank Savage, a tough-talking air force general given the unenviable task of taking command at a beleagured American base in Britain. The previous commander, Colonel Davenport (Gary Merrill), lost his nerve as the toll of bungled missions and dead pilots began to weigh on his conscience. Savage initially whips the men into shape and, although they dislike his frank and uncompromising attitude, the fliers gradually find their morale improving. With their upturn in fortunes, however, comes a series of increasingly dangerous missions - and even Savage finds himself cracking under the pressure as did Davenport before him. Peck is in fine form here (rarely was he better, other than in To Kill A Mockingbird). Special mention also to Hugh Marlowe as a misfit pilot who proves himself to be braver than anyone had ever foreseen, and Dean Jagger (an Oscar-winner for his work here) as an elderly paperwork clerk who occasionally stows away on risky bombing raids. The film explores the effects of high-pressure missions on the men involved, and comes to the disturbing conclusion that even the most iron-nerved of men can fold when the toll of war catches up with them. The psychological state of the characters becomes the main story thread - much more focal than, say, the actual bombing missions - but director Henry King ensures that the film remains thoroughly absorbing. You may come to Twelve O'Clock High expecting a film full of exhilarating aerial action, yet you won't get it. In spite of this, I guarantee you will still come away from the film totally affected by what you have seen. Great stuff.

Anything critical I might say about the film has nothing to do with the real story behind the film, as he and the others experienced it.Actually, I don't have that much to say that is critical.  It's a fine movie.  It had to be made no earlier than 1949 because it could not have been made during the war, dealing as it does with human weakness and disability in our own ranks.  By 1949, a banner year for a second look, with victory safely behind us, we could afford to peer a bit more closely at what actually went on.  But I should also point out that it includes just about every cliche in the book, as does the novel it was based on.  It may be that at the time of the film's release, these situations and bits of dialogue had not yet become cliches.  I'll just give a few examples Peck, as General Savage, says, I'm not here to win a popularity contest with Keith Davenport.  I'd lose THAT one.  I can't imagine how many times that line has resurfaced.  Another one Peck is giving a pep talk to the group.  There's nothing wrong with being afraid.  Fear is normal.  Only stop WORRYING about it.  Consider yourself already dead!  That's a pep talk?  I'll mention one example of this reasoning, the commander reassuring subordinates that fear is normal, resurfacing -- in Flying Leathernecks.  Beirne Lay's novel was a neatly written genre piece and the film follows it closely.  Many of the incidents are drawn from real life (eg., the experiences of the crew in the initial crash landing, with someone trying to land the B-17 with the mortally wounded pilot fighting him all the way and blood frozen all over the windscreen).  At that, the novel had to be tamed a bit here and there.  When Savage visits the officer's club for the first time he is not only insulted by Major Cobb at the bar, they actually get into a fist fight.  The production values are good.  The props and art direction convincing.  The score is evocative.  And the acting generally superb.  Gregory Peck has never been better at radiating principled sincerity.  Dean Jagger certainly deserved his Academy Award.  And the script itself is a grabber.  Savage may not be much of a psychologist -- he accuses Davenport of overidentification with his men -- but he's a human being under that ruthlessness, and his crack-up is moving, even if we don't know why it takes place exactly when it does.  It's still dramatic.  Savage cannot bring himself to swing through the nose hatch of the B-17 although he tries repeatedly.  The engines of all the airplanes are revving up and he holds on to a fuselage that is shivering with vibrations, whipped by wind, in an all-engulfing ocean of noise.The only combat scene is drawn from real footage.  It doesn't last long.  It doesn't have to.  It's horrifying and makes its point quickly and effectively.The losses suffered by the 8th Air Force in England were appalling.  I think it may have been Eaker who was in charge at that period, and he was intent on proving his point that precision daylight bombing would accomplish what de Seversky had been saying it would  the destruction of the enemy's capacity for waging war.  Well, at least as implemented here at this stage of the war, it didn't.  Bomber losses rose to insupportable levels and the program was suspended for a time.  (The British, carrying out night-time area bombing, were no more successful.)  The carefully documented Strategic Bombing Survey carried out after the war, under the guidance of John Kenneth Galbraith and others, should be required reading at all military academies.  The German industrial machine managed to cope with the bombing by various means, until their fuel sources were simply pounded into oblivion and finally taken by Russian troops.  At the end of the war there were hordes of new airplanes and other weapons ready for deployment, but no one left to man them, and no oil to drive them.  Bombs, it was concluded, are great for tearing up cities.  But they didn't weaken  the morale of civilians in Germany, any more than they had earlier in England.  The game was hardly worth the candle.  And if it couldn't break the back of a highly industrialized country like Germany, how could we ever have convinced ourselves that it would work twenty-five years later in a country that had virtually no important industrial targets, like North Vietnam?  There is something tragic about the image of an extremely expensive and effective ordnance platform like a B-52 dropping several tons of bombs and hoping to hit some peasants riding bicycles on a dirt trail through the jungle.But the persistence of that mythos is no reflection on the experiences and valor of the men who flew in the 8th Air Force, or on this film, which turned out to be the fons et origo of so many genre cliches.  It's gripping.

The story begins with Jagger in the late '40s standing on the old division grounds reminiscing. In the story, Peck steps in to take over command from Merrill, who has become too attached to his downtrodden men. They're low on morale and making a lot of mistakes. Peck runs a tight outfit with plenty of training and discipline, advising the men to grow up. Forget about passes, forget about going home. Accept the fact that you're already dead and it'll be easier for you, or words to that effect, he says by way of advice. His toughness works and turns the division into a highly successful one. But along the way, there are casualties, and Peck has to sublimate a lot of his true emotions.This is an excellent movie, both gripping and poignant, with actual fighter plane combat footage taken by both American and German soldiers that is mixed in with the film. The movie really makes you stop and think about what soldiers at war go through psychologically and what they face in battle. Twelve O'Clock High, (the title of which refers to a plane's position in the sky in relation to other planes) makes you care about this division and most of all, about its commanding officer. Try as he might, as tough as Peck is in this film, he somehow manages to convey a warmth and quiet concern - the qualities that make Atticus Finch perhaps the greatest character in movies. Handsome, with an authoritative voice and strong presence, Peck's personality permeates throughout, as it does so often.Highly recommended.

And it's really sad how far down movies have gone in the last sixty years. Watch TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH and compare it to modern movies like the HUNGER GAMES franchise. It's shot in black and white, with minimal special effects. (Indeed the combat footage is actual combat footage.) No poisonous fog or CGI baboons all hopped up on goofballs.This movie starts as a bomber group comes back from a run. They show no blood and guts, but the talk will literally make you sick to your stomach. It's that real, that wrenching. Instead of pretty tributes having their faces in the sky they talk about arms and legs being blown off in combat. And your imagination does the rest, if you're old enough to actually form mental pictures based on the tough, honest dialog.So then, the leader of the group begins to crack up. And it's not funny, it's not some weepy teen tantrum either. It's a grown man admitting that he can't cut it anymore. And then Gregory Peck comes in, determined to get the job done no matter what the cost in human lives. Imagine, a fully grown adult male in a leadership position! This movie is about war, and moral choices. But it's also about the nature of fatherhood. Gregory Peck seems to have specialized in exploring this theme, in films as strikingly different as TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH, and even THE OMEN. In all three films he is the father who has to make the tough choices, torn between protecting his children and forcing them to take on adult responsibilities. 12 O'CLOCK HIGH demonstrates the meaning of tough love long before the phrase became cheapened by popular media. Yet 12 O'CLOCK HIGH shows the price of tough love, just as THE OMEN shows what happens when tough love becomes too tough and becomes crazed brutality. (In a sense Damien was a deadbeat just like the boys in the Leper Colony in this film. Sometimes the bad seed cannot be redeemed.)This movie doesn't glorify war, but it does suggest that without role models, such as father figures who demand respect and insist on discipline, children are likely to remain children forever. It's no accident that in a movie like THE HUNGER GAMES or CATCHING FIRE, the adult authority figures are either villains or clowns. Whether it's the drunken Haymitch or the sinister President Snow or the campy Effie Trinket, only caricatures of adults are permitted in modern films. TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH is the kind of movie they just don't make anymore. Because everyone knows that only teenagers are cool and it's only cool to be an adult if you're trying to stay a teenager forever.

And then I put on TOH to take another look at the style vs Command Decision, and ended up watching the whole movie, and enjoying as much as the first time - a sign of a great film.What struck me about TOH on closer examination was the natural lighting, especially in the indoor scenes, with the high contrast lighting. There was a strong sense of atmosphere; you could almost feel the damp cold of the English weather, what with the rain outside and the coal fire inside. The indoor scenes were often shot wider than necessary to show more of the rooms, particularly the ceilings. The sound recording also preserved a lot of the ambient sounds, and when someone was talking with his back to the camera, the sound was slightly muffled. The result was a strong sense of realism, more so than Command Decision, which, even though it also had contrasty indoor lighting, still reeked of that MGM polish. With CD, you can't help thinking about the great acting, but with TOH there is more immediacy to the experience, and you get drawn into the story and don't think about the acting as much. TOH is also more emotionally gripping, while CD underplays the emotion. However, regarding acting, it was interesting seeing Hugh Marlowe, and comparing this to his role in The Day the Earth Stood Still, which many criticize as stiff, though I think was right for the role. In TOH his performance doesn't stand out, which is as it should be; it is a very natural style of acting. Millard Mitchell, whom I remember more from Westerns, seems a bit stiff at first, as does Gregory Peck, which I suppose might be the way officers behave. We see Peck going back and forth from being very stiff and tough to being very human, the most remarkable example being when he stops his car before entering the base, has a cigarette, and transforms himself into the tough commanding officer. Which is the better movie? TOH is the obvious winner; in fact, I would rate it among the classics like Casablanca and High Noon, which stand up well to repeat viewings. But TOH and CD should be considered complementary, showing different perspectives of the same situation. Dawn Patrol covers the same subject from the WWI perspective, showing that the stress of sending fliers out to face a high probability of death was equally true then as in WWII. I wonder if it is as true today? Another movie that comes to mind in this will they come back genre is Memphis Belle. Compare MB's portrayal of the WWII fliers' immature behavior to TOH. With TOH we get a sense these are just kids who need to grow up fast, but take their jobs seriously. With MB, it seems the Army Air Force is made up of overgrown 10 to 12 year olds. My guess is TOH, being made closer to the war, is more accurate. I watched TOH on TV as a kid, but all I remember was the scene of the air battle, and of Gregory Peck shouting 12 o'clock high! Yet this lone battle scene is only a small part of the movie, I realize now. The rest is about how individuals handle the stress of war, and how they relate to each other, through official rank and as human beings. Most of all, TOH is about the actions of bravery and self sacrifice by young men at a critical time in the war. Yes, TOH is about Americans, and only makes brief allusion to the British nighttime bombing, but the challenges were the same. The incredible bravery of British aviators is portrayed in The Battle of Britain. It was natural for the Americans to take the more dangerous daytime bombing missions at that point, giving the exhausted British a breather. (And what about the Germans? Dawn Patrol is the only one that shows the German fliers as humans, too.)A key element of TOH not explicitly mentioned is the Norden bombsight. When Peck says, Bombadier, you're flying the plane now, that's because the Norden took over autopilot controls, leading the plane to the target. The Norden was the key to precision bombing at 20,000 feet, though there is some disagreement over whether it worked as well as claimed. This is alluded to when Peck orders a bombing run at 9,000 feet. Later in the war, Allied aviators would fly into Germany almost unchallenged in massive numbers, able to carpet bomb cities. But in 1942, bombing Germany probably felt more like a suicide mission. These were true heroes.

Or, more truthfully, a story leading up to a long stretch toward the end that shows battle, drawn in part from actual footage from the war, taken by both American and the German photographers during the war. The gradual development of characters, all with flaws, and all looking out for each other, makes up the first two thirds of this long movie.It's a man's movie, meaning it's about men and their role in the war. Romance and the other usual layers of civilian life are missing. Not that you miss this. The urgency and ongoing action which seems to propel even the lulls between action is heroic and impressive, for sure, but far more important is how tender it is, and tragic, and how much you want to weep through it all. Which for me is a good war movie.But a lot of attention was paid to filming (and editing) the flying sequences, and as an outsider to all that, I found it all exciting in a kinetic, historic, and horrifying kind of way. You can tell what some of the authentic footage is and because it's real it has amazing impact--you know it's not CGI or Hollywood matte shooting. In fact, the authenticity of the non-combat sections is impressive, and comes partly because it was filmed just four years after the surrender of Germany, and the attitudes, language, cadence are all right on. (Compare this to movies made now of that time, as good as they might be in other ways, like Saving Private Ryan for one.) So even when it's slow (and the first half hour is slow) it's absorbing. And the acting is excellent--Gregory Peck just one of many great performers in straight ahead, convincing roles.A note on the tone, the pessimism throughout. Clearly in contrast to the positive films made during the war, and following a trend of introspection and frankly loneliness (detachment, doubt) started with The Best Years of Our Lives in 1946, this movie is consistently dour and tainted with struggle and questioning. No cheerleading here, but lots of sober analysis, probing conversations, or interior confessions of anger or disagreement. This only makes it more persuasive--war, when it's being fought, is psychologically challenging and damaging, and the movie lays all of this open.A final thought about the fighting scenes--the hard core aerial photography doesn't occur until almost two hours into the movie (it's a long movie). So the rest of the time you really do depend on the psychology and the interpersonal drama to float it all. Which it does very well. Director Henry King is no great stylist, but he directed this with great control, and it's taut and rather beautiful throughout.

That it is natural and normal to be afraid but you must subordinate your emotions to the good of the group and getting the job done. Frank Savage in this movie takes over a bomber group that has figured out that at the casualty rate they are going, none of them will survive the war. Davenport tried to handle their fear with compassion and sharing their danger. The strain broke him. Savage, to get the maximum effort, handles it with ice water and his accept that your dead speech when he assumes command. He also handles it with practical measures. Tightening their formation flying with repeated practice (which cuts down on losses) that demonstrate to the men that though he isn't showing Davenport's heart he is taking them all in the right direction.The second is the loneliness of command, the fact that you must control your natural tendency to like the men under your command and want them to like you. That you must be ready without qualm to send them to their deaths and refuse yourself the indulgence of mourning. General Savage, as the exec correctly perceives, is every bit as compassionate as Davenport but to get the job done and get a 'maximum effort' from the crews he must accept becoming an object of their hatred. Notice the way General Savage nervously grabs a quick cigarette before he gets 'into character' as the heavy. He must crush his desire for Billy's friendship, even when Billy publicly offered it by supporting him over the transfer requests. His mock chewing out of paper shufflers when Stovall declares his intention to stall processing those transfer requests to buy him more time to turn things around, even if it means getting in trouble.Gately, a career soldier and the son of career soldiers, saw the price of command and would not pay it. Note how in the early Davenport scenes Gately always seems to make himself scarce whenever there is a problem. The scene where Savage tears into Gately for his abandonment of Davenport has got to be the most visceral chewing out in the history of motion pictures. The scene where Savage visits Gately in the hospital and gives him his honor back is touchingly understated.This is one of the greatest films ever.

They flew by day flying in low to maximize damage to their targets. It also had the effect of maximizing casualties. The British believed in night bombardment just like what the Luftwaffe had been doing to their cities. Fly in high, drop your load approximately where you want it land and hope you hit your target. The British were truly not interested in minimizing civilian casualties as the Germans had shown no inclination in that regard towards them. Americans tend to forget that in debates about the effectiveness of air power during World War II.Twelve O'Clock High broke no new ground here. The same issues had been dealt with before in both versions of The Dawn Patrol and in Command Decision. But we managed in this film to get far more action and far better performances over all than in the other two.The 918th Bomber Group has been having a run of bad luck and it becomes the opinion of headquarters that its beloved commander Gary Merrill is thinking of the men as individuals rather than the mission at hand. Gregory Peck is sent by General Millard Mitchell to take over command and he proceeds to clean house. Merrill is kicked upstairs to headquarters as Peck brings a new discipline to the group. Of course the strain of command has its effect on Peck as we see in the balance of the film. But he gradually begins to win the respect and admiration of the pilots and crews.Gregory Peck was nominated for an Oscar as Best Actor, but lost to Broderick Crawford in All the King's Men. Dean Jagger won the Best Supporting Actor Award that year. It is his memories as we see him vacationing in postwar UK of the events of the film, that is the perspective the film is viewed from.However my own personal favorite performance in Twelve O'clock High is that of Hugh Marlowe. Marlowe is Merrill's second in command and when Peck relieves him of that position he ranks him out terribly. In fact he reassigns him to a plane with every gold brick in the outfit and deems the plane the Leper Colony. For the rest of the film you can see it in his face the hate he has for Peck and the determination to prove him wrong. As the General, Millard Mitchell keeps harping on the fact that the planes and their crews need to produce a maximum effort. Just how much is a maximum effort before men and machines fall apart? Twelve O'Clock High provides no answers, but raises the provocative question.

Later, as a student in Munich in the late 1950s I gained another, different perspective on precision daylight bombing which killed mostly women and children. This was made a bit more poignant when I discovered in 1990 that a cousin of mine had been shot down in his P51 Mustang just over an hour's drive from where I was attending school - on April 14, 1945, weeks before the end, on an extra mission he had volunteered for. Today (2005) in Munich they are still rebuilding churches. This is one of the great aviation stories of all time. And I see it from three or four different perspectives at once.

After buying the cup Harvey drives with his bicycle to the old Archbury Airfield outside of London where the 918th was stationed and reminisces as we, and Harvey, go back some seven years to 1942 when he served in the outfit. Being one of the first USAAF bomber groups to be stationed in England the 918th suffered such heavy losses of men and bombers on it bombing missions over German occupied France that it's commanding officer, sensitive and caring, Col. Davenport, Garry Merrill, was grounded and replaced by hard nosed and hard driving Brig. General Frank Savage, Gregory Peck, to whip the airmen into shape and hardened their nerves since so many were breaking down from the stress of the daylight bombing missions that they were flying. Gen Savage drove the men so hard and was totally uncompromising towards them when it came to getting help for the stress that they were suffering. Like closing down the officers club and not letting them be as ease by being out of uniform when they were back at the base from their dangerous bomber missions. These actions by Gen. Savage made all the airmen of the 918th put in for transfers out of the unit. Gen. Savage soon earned the respect of the men under him by joining them in their combat flights over Europe and also being on the lead bomber the most dangerous place in the bomber formation. Over the long run Gen. Savages hard nose tactics did work with the 918th becoming the most effective bomber group in the entire US 8th Air Force in Great Britian. Even though the airmen of the 918th respected Gen. Savage they still didn't feel close to him. Since he couldn't break out of the strict code that he set for himself as a hard as steel nerved warrior who just couldn't show any emotion to his men or to himself. Feeling that it would take away the edge that he and his men needed to survive the war.The General started to feel a bit of guilt later on in the film when he was told that Lt. Col. Ben L. Gately,,Hugh Marlow, was hospitalized after a bombing mission with a broken vertebrate which was damaged, but he didn't report it, a while back. Lt. Col. Gatley whom Gen. Savage chewed out for being a coward earlier flew three combat missions while suffering from that injury. At the hospital you, as well as Lt. Lt. Col. Gately, could see Gen. Savage clumsily try to apologize to him about what he did in regards of his humiliating him earlier in the movie where Let. Col. Gately asked for an immediate transfer out of the unit to get away from his ravings. For the first time you could also see that the general had blood, instead of ice water, in his veins. Tremendous war movie that doesn't have any action scenes in it until the last twenty or so minutes of the film but is more effective then movies with wall to wall combat footage throughout the entire film. The movie comes to an end with the US 8th Air Force bombing of the German city of Schweinfurt, the major manufacture of anti-friction ball bearings for the Nazi war machine, on Black Thursday October 14, 1943 where it suffered the heaviest single day losses of bomber and air men in the air war over German occupied Europe; 77 B17 bombers were shot down or crashed and were destroyed beyond repair on their way back after the mission with almost 700 US airmen killed wounded and missing.Gen. Savage was on that deadly mission and came back in high spirits ready to go back in the air the next day over the unfriendly skies of Germany. Just as he was about to get on his B17 bomber he suffered a major psychical and emotional breakdown from the stress of the daylight bombing missions, that he participated in, over Europe that left him almost unconscious and hospitalized. Gen. Savage finally realized what the men, that he once called cowards and slackers, went through by suffering the same symptoms that they had which showed him, and everyone else, he was a human being not the unemotional and unfeeling machine that he always tried to be.

But Sometimes Iron can MElt and Frank Savage soon finds himself following the same path as Colonel Davenport and he identifies too strongly with the man. And Savage Crumbles. But not before he's done his job and turned in a Bomber Squadron that can do the job no matter the Cost.Greg Peck dazzles in this movie and so does Dean Jagger.

The movie is more about the psychology of war then actual fighting only in the 3rd act do we really see any true combat action, but what's happening on the ground is enough to keep you in your seat.The movie starts with the former base adjunct officer Major Stovall(Dean Jagger) buying an old mug in a London shop, then you see him visiting the site of the old base at Archball where nature is reclaiming the land where the base was located during the war. You get the impression that given enough time nature will totally reclaim the site and what happened there will be just fading memories. The movie then shifts back in time during the war a bomber group has just returned from a bombing run where they took heavy casualties, one of the bombers crash lands symbolic of what is wrong with the unit. We are then taken to debriefing and the pilot of the plane is particularly shaken. We see many morale problems with the unit mostly stemming from the lead commander Colonel Davenport(Gary Merrill) who's main fault is that he is to emotionally attached to his men thus not looking after the mission first. The next seen we see Major General Pat Pritchard (Millard Mitchell) placing General Frank Savage(Gregory Peck) in charge to kick butt and be a real hard nose to whip the unit into shape. The question is will Savage also get caught up in the men and lose his objectivity. The real antagonist of the story is your inner self and how do you stay focused on a mission without losing yourself.

It even manages to be great without a love interest, or even a female face.The opening 15 minutes of the movie has to be one the best beginnings for a movie ever.  When Dean Jaeger pulls his hat down and faces the sound of a cranking radial engine, then the grass behind him begins blowing, it's extremely dramatic and one of the great moments in film, and an unbeatable way to slide into the story.There are some technical goof's though and some mischaracterizations of how things were.The initial technical goof is that when the fighters are maneuvering to attack by flying around the outside of the formation, you hear the sound of the fighters engines.  In reality, the noise from inside the B-17's, or any bomber of WWII is so great that no one inside the airplane would be able to hear the sound of even the closest flying airplane next to them.During the fighter attacks, several shots of an attacking fighter turn out to be not a Focke Wulf 190, but a Republic P-47.  This is obvious because 1. It's not painted but polished aluminum and no German fighter flew in combat without camouflage paint over the aluminum skin.  2. The pilot is in a bubble canopy cockpit.  3. There are four machine guns firing away from the wing.  During WWII, only one fighter had four machine guns in each wing, that was the P-47 Thunderbolt.This was just a ground filmed shot of the P-47 used in several WWII films.In addition, nearly all the shots of lone attacking fighters, if they were actually in focus, weren't German fighters, they were either Spitfires, or P-47's.  The only actual combat shots of attacking German fighters are obvious because they are jerky, poorly focused and brief, which is entirely understandable given that the camermen were being shot at.In the opening scene when the bombers come in for landing, one of the bombers lands gear up and smashes through a tent.  One can only wonder what the heck a tent is doing out there right next to the runway, I can only guess that it's there for the bomber to slide through to make it seem more dramatic.Finally, the climactic scene in which Gregory Peck succumbs to fatigue and cannot enter his bomber by swinging up through the nose hatch is a bit of Hollywood fluff.  No member of an actual combat crew entered their bomber using that hatch.  It was way too strenuous to do so, they walked around to the waist hatch and walked up through the interior to their positions. But obviously the director used this technique to demonstrate how affected Peck was supposed to be and without it, it would be difficult to dramatize the depth of his collaps.Charles Scott "},{"Title":"A True Leader","Date":"13 June 2003","Score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, War","Review":"  Gregory Peck created one of the true USAF (Army Air Corps) leadership and mentor roles in 12 O'Clock High.

I don't recall the exact year, but it was first seen in the 1970's. Only recently has the film appeared on any of the satellite channels. Then thanks to IMDb, I learned it was available on VHS and hurriedly got myself a copy. And, having a bit of a memory problem, it along with The Longest Day, and In Harm's Way, are films I seldom pass up seeing again.Many of the depictions show the officer's rank properly. As a Brigadier General, General Savage's single stars are worn centered on jacket epaulets. This accurate depiction is often not seen in films of today. Usually on the costumes provided officers of this rank, somebody puts them way out on the sewed-down portion and that is always wrong. It is a location reserved for generals as this rank can easily be seen from quite a long distance. They can then be properly regarded with the extraordinary respect and courtesy shown general officers. I applaud the respect this film shows all servicemen, with the military accuracies.I don't know if it was factual in the war years, but I can tell you as one who sat in briefings and Commander's Calls, I found it an interesting oyxmoron; the outburst by an unidentified man in the Group announcing, I'll take Colonel Keith Davenport anytime . . . .  And the concurring reply, Me too! This flies in the face of reality, at least in the military circles I was in. To me, the only way this would have happened was if the man suddenly took leave of his senses. But I guess Hollywood elements have to creep into the best works.Part of the interest is the black & white rendering instead of the color we see nowadays. I liken it to my hobby pursuit of photography and say that color is for documentaries and B&W is reserved for art. As a work of art, I believe this film will long prevail in the top of films portraying WW II air action. I give it a 5 star vote.

You know you're in for something different when the leading man--Gregory Peck--doesn't appear until about 15 minutes into the film.  When he does appear, he sets the tone of the film that war is an ensemble, not a vanity role, and every man contributes--for better or worse.  In his case, Peck (who never turned in a bad performance) gives a fascinating, well-nuanced character study that he may never have bettered over his long career.  The rest of the cast is equally fine, especially Dean Jagger as Peck's assistant and Millard Mitchell as the Major General.  I have to disagree with the poster who said that he found elements of the film cliche'ed.  On the contrary--I would say that real people often turn to cliche's when they are in uncertain circumstances, just as the characters in this film do.  In fact, I'd say that Twelve O'Clock High manages to avoid just about every Hollywood convention.  It is never maudlin or manipulative.  Its use of music is very spare.  The combat scenes--while exciting--are straightforward yet unpredictable.  There is much about the War that those of us too young to have lived through it can never know.  I felt after watching Twelve O'Clock High that I had a rare insight into the men that were there.

He plays General Savage, a disciplinarian general given the task straightening up a bomber squad during the World War 11. Plenty of tough dialogues and tense situation ensues in his progress of bringing the squad up to shape. There is real footage of dogfight taken from the real war and for its time, the movie is pretty realistic. Peck is great; as usual I learned, and watch out for the Climax where you learn why Gregory is one of the best performers in Hollywood. It could be anti-climax, depending on how you take it. His character is a disciplinarian, bordering on obsession, and when the real thing happens...watch the movie and find out.The best part of this movie is that it is straightforward. None of that romance subplot which has slow down many film (Sinatra's Never So Few comes to mind).  Everybody talks and moves the way they should, with economy of dialogue and exposition.

Standout performances by Gregory Peck, Dean Jagger, Millard Mitchell and Gary Merrill, among others and stark black and white cinematography, make this the ultimate men's film. No modern day cheering or self-congratulation, this film takes a hard, unflinching look at men at the breaking point.

The hard charging Frank Savage is called upon by Mitchell to replace his friend, who's been rendered ineffective by his over-identification with his men. Peck is outstanding as the grimly determined General who knows how to grab the men by the seat of the pants and give them the shake they need.

I then located the book, which was resurrected in paperback for the TV series in 1965, and I wore out three copies (I now have an original paperback). The novel was history re-written as entertainment, and as a tribute, and both authors lived the adventure. With their aid as screenwriters, Henry King magnificently translated the novel into a work of genius.The incidents in the novel, not all of which appear in the movie, were all actual incidents from the 8th Air Force in World War II. Each personality has its counterpart in real life. The main theme of the book was that a small cadre of pre-war airmen, an intimate fraternity actually, teamed with civilians-turned-to-airmen to beat the Nazis, each contributing equally in an army of democracy. The 918th was actually based on the 306th Bomb Group, and the relief of the CO by a member of the commanding general's staff actually happened twice in 1943. The story line is an amalgamation of the two separate incidents. Another reviewer has questioned whether a general would fly combat missions, and the answer is yes--the character of Savage, while based primarily on Col. Frank Armstrong (who took over the 306th under the conditions depicted), also has roots in Brig. Gen. Fred Castle, who took over another hard-luck group. General Castle was killed in action flying a B-17 during the Battle of the Bulge, earning him the Medal of Honor.Lay and Bartlett (who was a screenwriter by trade before the war) worked with both of these officers, who with Lay came to England right after Pearl Harbor to establish an 8th Air Force when there weren't any bases, men, or airplanes available. This small group worked for General Eaker (depicted as General Pritchard in the film) and their love for their story is richly evident in both products.A truly great film, not just for its veracity, authenticity, and psychological drama, but for its Everyman qualities. Twelve O'Clock High had a competitor, much as Saving Private Ryan vied with The Thin Red Line, in both print and film (Command Decision starring Clark Gable). While similar in some aspects, I believe that Twelve O'Clock High is remembered and loved because it encapsulates so well the efforts of the most common man as much as the highest general--which was what World War II was about for most Americans.

This film, done in black and white, would have not benefitted from color and perhaps would not have been as good. There have been comments about the writing, mentioning only Sy Bartlett. This is a disservice to the real writer, Beirne Lay, Jr.  Lay flew B-17s in Europe as a member of the 100th Bomb Group. He was co-pilot of the B-17 Picadilly Lily, also the name of Gen.

It is a shame that Peck did not win, losing out to Broderick Crawford. Acting by the other cast members is excellent. With all the stress shown, there is some comic relief in the interplay between Savage and his driver, Sgt.

Gregory Peck plays an air force general assigned to resurrect the flagging performance of a bomber group.  He succeeds at great cost to himself.  The entire story is a flashback seen through the eyes of the general's aide (played by Dean Jagger).The film presents the horror of war in an unusually subtle way.  At the beginning of the film a bomber crash lands.  One of the crew is missing.  One limb is still in the plane.  Where's the rest of him, one of the cast asks.  In a French hospital I hope, the pilot responds.  When it became obvious that he wouldn't survive the return flight, the crew placed a tourniquet on him and gave him a parachute.  Dean Jagger climbs into the plane with a blanket and soon reappears cradling something in the blanket.Much of the film occurs inside the dingy and dark confines of the quonset hut offices of the air group.  Decisions are made.  Some are promoted.  Others are demoted.  Ultimately, there is resurrection for the group as they come to have pride in themselves and each other.Hugh Marlowe has an interesting role as an officer demoted by Peck early in the film.  He is assigned to fly a plane named The Leper Colony, which becomes the home of all the malcontents and incompetents in the outfit.  He flies unflinchingly even after his plane crashes in the English channel.  His resurrection in the eyes of the general is one of the most touching moments in the film.  He is recuperating in the hospital after flying three missions with a broken back.  The general realizes that he has misjudged Marlowe.  He can't quite come to admit it, but he goes to see Marlowe at the hospital.  When the general leaves there are tears in Marlowe's eyes.There are few action scenes in this film.  Near the end there is a scene that contains some great combat footage from both Allied and German sources.  There is also another scene where a bomber crash lands and takes out some tents.  Apparently, this stunt wasn't originally part of the script, but it was so good that the filmmakers left it in.  I would have done so, too.The psychological cost of war is obvious at the end.  Peck can't fly.  He has a physical and mental breakdown.  Although he can't fly with the group, he can't let go until the planes return.  When they do he goes to bed, probably for a long time.  He is finished as a commander.  He has come to the same point as his predecessor.  It is never clear what happens to him.  It is perhaps significant that we see the story through his aide's eyes.

The film's dedication states This motion picture is dedicated to those Americans, both living and dead, whose gallant effort made possible daylight precision bombing. They were the only Americans fighting in Europe in the fall of 1942. They stood alone, against the enemy and against doubts from home and abroad. This is their story . Gen. Frank Savage (Gregory Peck , though John Wayne turned down this leading role) is sent by Gen. Pritchard (Millard Mitchell) to the combat group after the Bomber Commander Col. Keith Davenport (Gary Merrill) is relieved of duty . As a hard-as-nails general takes over a bomber unit suffering from low morale and whips them into fighting shape . However , the newcomer General also begins to feel the strain of the leadership . This is a story of valiant twelve men as their women never knew them . It is an example of a pilot's enemy position call . During World War II pilots would call-out the positions of enemy airplanes by referring to their bearings via the use of a pretend face of a clock . In this case, 12 O'Clock meant the enemy was directly ahead, whereas 6 O'Clock would mean directly behind. High or Low referred to whether the enemy was above or below the airplane respectively. Even meant that the enemy was level with the pilot's plane. This is a thrilling film dealing with patriotism and heroism , starred by a maverick General and his underlings carrying out risked feats on air and bombing German installations . However , the air battles were cut together from authentic World War II footage . In fact , the opening prologue states  The air battle scenes in this Motion Picture were photographed in actual combat by members of the United States Air Force and the German Luftwaffe . Much of the flick concerns the relentless fight of a brave General , masterfully played by Gregory Peck , to whip his outfit into a disciplined team in spite of heavy casualties . This film is frequently cited by surviving bomber crewmembers as the only accurate depiction from Hollywood of their life during the war . Based on a novel by Beirne Lay Jr. and Sy Bartlett ; being well adapted by these authors , they wanted the script to concentrate fully on the psychological effects of war and the theme of commanding . Many characters in this film were based on real-life people such as Gen. Savage inspired by Gen. Frank Armstrong and many others . Excellent Gregory Peck as the flight commander who takes over an England-based bomber squadron and it helped assure him a place in Hollywood immortality . Very good support cast such as Hugh Marlowe as Lt. Col. Ben Gately , Gary Merrill as Col. Keith Davenport , Millard Mitchell as Gen. Pritchard , Robert Arthur as Sgt. McIllhenny , Paul Stewart as Capt. 'Doc' Kaiser and Dean Jagger as Maj. Harvey Stovall , he won an Academy Award for secondary actor for his fine acting ; most of them inspired on real characters . Evocative as well as sensitive musical score by the classic Alfred Newman . Atmospheric cinematography in black and white by Leon Shamroy , usual cameraman of super-productions . Henry King 's direction is well crafted , though William A. Wellman was attached to direct at one point . Here Henry King is more thought-provoking and inclined toward brooding issues and no much action , as a romantic subplot, which features in the book, was dropped at the studio's insistence . King is an expert on compelling Adventure/Western genre , as he directed classic Westerns as ¨ Jesse James¨ (1939) and ¨The gunfighter¨ (1950) with Peck again . Koster was specialist on Adventure genre as proved in ¨Untamed¨ , ¨Captain King¨ , ¨Captain of Castilla¨ , ¨Black Swan¨ , ¨Stanley and Livingstone ¨and many others . Rating  Better than average .

The General is moved in because the men of the group are starting to believe their reputation as a 'bad luck group'; with inevitable effects on moral. Savage immediately sets about fixing things; starting with the sentry wore waves him onto the base without checking his ID just because he was in a staff car. He then proceeds to close the bar, the executive officer is released from that duty and ordered to fly a plane called 'The Leper Colony' along with any crewman he believes isn't coming up to the mark. Not surprisingly all of the pilots apply to be transferred out. They change their minds after a particularly successful mission where they are the only group to hit the target. It looks as if things are going well as they continue to me successful. There are of course losses and as time progresses these losses start to affect the general until he can't take it any more.When this started I feared this was going to be another 'how the Americans won the war' film as the introductory blurb referred to the USAAF bomber pilots standing alone with no reference to other Allied forces. Thankfully it soon became apparent that it would be nothing like that as the group returns; many crewmen dead or dying and one plane spectacularly crash landing with its wheels up... amazingly this stunt was done for real! We don't see much of the actual combat; only one raid is shown. That raid is incredibly tense though; largely due to the inclusion of genuine Second World War combat footage; the picture is slightly scratchy in these parts but otherwise fits seamlessly into the film. The film is a believable depiction of how war can take brave men to breaking point. It is believable due to the fine acting; not just from star Gregory Peck, who plays General Savage but from the whole cast. Don't watch this if you want gung-ho action but if you want a serious film about the men who serve in war you could do a lot worse.

In line with this we can see a change in how cinema dealt with the war, with a gradual trend away from the idealistic, gung-ho propaganda to a more reasoned and person-centred study. This was especially true in the years following the close of conflict. 12 O'Clock High is a war movie that, excepting a ten-minute airborne sequence towards the end, is not a combat movie. This is a war drama set in mess halls and briefing rooms, and despite its lack of action manages to hold our attention for its two-and-a-bit hour runtime.One of the problems you often get with wartime pictures is that you have a lot of guys running round in near-identical uniforms, and it becomes difficult to get to know characters or remember who's who. Add to this the fact that a lot of their actions are supposed to be uniformly regulated and their words will be specialist military language (At ease, Affirmative &#x96; that sort of thing) making them seem even more homogenous. It is not easy to write individualism into a military scenario. 12 O'Clock High however, adapted by Sy Bartlett and Beirne Lay from their own novel, is different because it avoids militaristic cliché and gives each character a very personal introduction. But it still manages to weave this into regular armed forces business, never once appearing inauthentic.A lot of the picture's strength in this respect is also down to a top-notch cast. The performances here do not exactly sear themselves into the viewer's mind &#x96; this story does not feature passionate speechmaking or blazes of anger &#x96; but there is a general quality of believable humanity from all the men. At the heart of it is a subtle yet charismatic turn from Gregory Peck. It doesn't look like he's doing much, but it's actually the simplicity of Peck's performance that makes the character work. When he has his breakdown towards the end, he makes it look realistically severe, but manages to come away from it with the character's dignity and boldness intact. That is the sort of thing that an actor like Peck can do for a role.12 O'Clock High is directed by Henry King, a highly-respected movie veteran who typically got all the most prestigious projects at Fox. He was obviously very competent, but he was no mere hack, and had a somewhat unique approach to shooting a picture. His outdoor shots are particularly distinctive, making us aware of natural beauty, but not through rolling landscapes. Instead he shows off the outdoors at close-quarters, giving every leaf its shape and detail. This gives a strange kind of intimacy to scenes such as General Pritchard briefing Peck by the lake. Story-wise the scene doesn't need to take place outdoors, so King obviously chose that location with care. There is not unlike the interior scenes, which are dim and often windowless, yet full of unique tone and feature.Apparently, the original novel featured a romantic subplot, which was dropped at the insistence of studio heads. This seems strange nowadays when Hollywood is often accused of adding or exaggerating the love angle in previously chaste source material. To be honest that accusation was probably made by 1940s purists as well. But this picture demonstrates that Hollywood was not simply a factory for lowest-common-denominator audience fodder, and while it was certainly dedicated to producing quality product that sold tickets, it had the courage to do so on the strength of dramatic integrity.

Old soldiers returning to the exact spot on earth where they probably suffered and lost the most in all their lives is almost unbearably haunting and certainly moving to anyone with with a fully functioning brain.This movie is a psychological study of command, and dealing with unimaginable fear and stress.Try to imagine getting up at 400am, if you could sleep at all, trying to eat breakfast when your stomach is in your throat. Imagine putting on a wool and leather flight suit when the outside temperature on the ground is 85 digress, knowing that you'll be at 20,000 feet in -40 degrees below zero temperatures for most of the day to come. Imagine firing a 50 caliber machine gun through an open hole in a fuselage moving at close to 200 mph, 40 degrees below zero at a spec in the sky, coming at your airplane, its own set of huge machine guns firing at you.....When General Savage tells the assembled bomb group to accept the fact that you are already dead, in order to cope with the fear...there can be no more devastating statement a leader could utter....yet the truth of it was all too real. Young men came and disappeared everyday at a bomber base in England. Entire maintenance crews were formed and reformed as the B-17s they worked on never came back, and the 10 man crews were lost.Much has been filmed and written about the foot soldiers, and the sailors in WWII.....very little about the young men who were blown out of the sky at 200 mph, 4 miles up in a dead cold sky...these young men kept on coming...showing up at the airbases....flying missions and disappearing forever...they reduced Germany to rubble, flattened their factories, killing German people by the hundreds of thousands until the only country to have started 2 World Wars and lost both of them, shut itself down and surrendered to the rest of the world for the second time in the 20th century.12 O'Clock High is a masterwork....but Steven Spielberg needs to do a remake using today's CGI tech, to show us what really happened to these boys when the cannon of a FW 190 raked the fuselage of a B-17 full of bombs and 10 very young men. Bodies come apart when hit by 50 caliber rounds, and the the cannon shells of the Luftwaffe were even larger, and exploded when they hit. Take us into the cockpit of a B-17 as it spirals toward the ground, the g-force so strong the pilots cannot get out of their seats.Gregory Peck deserved an Academy Award for his performance....the rest of the cast was superb. I wonder how many actors we could find today to equal the quality of that cast.The belly landing performed by stunt pilot Paul Mantz at the beginning is one of the greatest landings wheels up or down, ever filmed.This is an A-List WWII movie.

Assuming that a classic film is one that stands up to repeated re-viewings, I have to say that this film is classic, and it has become, hands down, my favorite film about World War II in the air.One of the remarkable and striking aspects of this film is that it includes very little combat -- which occurs only at the climax of the film -- but rather covers men before and after combat, so we're focused on the anticipation of what they are in for or the fallout of what they've been through. And really, the best films about war explore how men face up to the stress, terror, and absurdity of combat.Indeed, one of the strongest scenes in the film is watching the ground crew play baseball whilst waiting for the bomber crews to return home. Given what comes ahead of it, the tension is palpable -- almost Hitchcock-like. Likewise, in the last scene when Gen. Savage is grounded with delirium, he's not the only one who is up there with them as we wait with him at RAF Alconbury. And this is the great strength of the film we get a striking exposition of the philosophical and psychological aspects of modern warfare, and I think that's the only reason to make a movie about war. I think in its own way it is comparable to films like Paths of Glory and The Seven Samurai.Add to that not just sterling individual performances from Gregory Peck, Hugh Marlowe, and Dean Jagger, but also wonderful ensemble acting across the board. This is a film highly deserving of wider recognition.

Not surprising, of course, because the actual war sequences in B-17s &#x96; the parts that kids like to see &#x96; form only a relatively small segment of the overall story.However, sixty years later, after a second viewing, there's no doubt this is one of the best films made about American servicemen in World War Two first, the acting by all of the principal players captures the times. And, coming only five years after the end of hostilities surely helped the writers and producers to get it right. And they sure did...Gregory Peck, as General Savage (an appropriate name, given his SOB status at the start of the movie), cannot be faulted with his performance. Hugh Marlowe as Lt. Col. Ben Gately gives the best performance of his career, I think &#x96; even better than his showing in Night and the City (1950). On the other hand, Gary Merrill as Col. Davenport was well drawn, but his performance in All about Eve (1950) was surely better.Well known character actors, Dean Jagger as Major Stovall and Millard Mitchell as General Pritchard provide that extra touch of authenticity to a story that is done so well &#x96; but has also been done before (as all good stories are). John Wayne, for example, provided a US Army equivalent (to Peck's role here) in The Sands of Iwo Jima (1949) with his portrayal of tough Sergeant Stryker, whipping his soldiers into shape.General Savage, of course, is sent to relieve Col. Davenport of command, and whip the 918 squadron into shape. How he does that forms the essence of this timeless story.The script is sparse, tough and believable. There is no waffling, no unnecessary or gratuitous scenes. The film editing is very effective, merging war-time footage with story settings almost seamlessly &#x96; particularly with the interaction between the Luftwaffe fighters and the American B-17s. The realism was so good, it was, truly, almost like being there.I also appreciated the muted sound track &#x96; being composed mainly of old war-time songs and only brief non-digetic music. The rest of the time, the story is music free, as it should be.The nostalgic mood is suitably set with Major Stovall visiting the war-time airstrip where the 918 squadron was based, and there he reminisces about the whole experience as the war-time songs and the drone of B-17s grow louder...Nothing's perfect, but in the context of when it was made, this film rates a nine in my opinion. Get the DVD, sit back, and watch how Hollywood used to do it soooo well.

Now I'm kicking myself for not getting around to it sooner. Excellent performances by Gregory Peck, Dean Jagger and a fine group of supporting players. At the core of the story is a psychological examination of how much a man can take under combat stress, a condition alluded to a number of times as 'maximum effort'. The film deftly examines the relationship Brigadier General Frank Savage (Gregory Peck) establishes with the men placed under his command, following the removal of fellow officer and friend Keith Davenport (Gary Merrill). Beginning with Major Stovall (Jagger), Savage gradually wins the unit over with a firm administration of discipline and confidence building that sets the stage for a series of successful bombing raids, culminating in targets inside German enemy lines. With the picture's set up comes a challenge - how long will it be before General Savage begins to question his own 'overidentification' with the men he's placed in charge of, placing their concerns over those of the mission. It's a skillfully told story with a message that should resonate today, though unfortunately, the passage of time and strangulating influence of political correctness has impacted all areas of society, including the military. With the present day world growing more dangerous every day, it strikes me that what the country needs more than ever is a leader that can stand up and articulate a concept so boldly professed by Peck's character - I don't have a lot of patience for this 'What are we fighting for stuff'.

Gregory Peck dominates this realistic film as Brigadier General Frank Savage. He has the onerous task of whipping a demoralized squadron of B-17 Flying Fortress crews into shape after they lose their beloved leader. Scenarists Sy Bartlett and Beirne Lay, Jr., who flew bombing missions during World War II, adapted their novel for the screen and it qualifies as 'a maximum effort' by everybody, with Dean Jagger and Hugh Marlowe taking top honors behind Peck. Indeed, Jagger received the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role.The strength of this film lies in its persuasive performances by a top-flight cast, King's taut helming, and four-time Oscar winning Leon Shamroy's gripping black & white cinematography. Just to give you an idea how highly his peers thought of Shamroy, they nominated Shamroy fourteen times for the Best Photography Oscar and he received two nominations in the same year for Cleopatra and The Cardinal. Cleopatra clinched Shamroy the Oscar in 1963. Anyway, this war film keeps its heels firmly planted at attention on the tarmac and doesn't physically take off with aerial footage until its last half-hour. Incredibly, King stages everything with such verve on the ground that you don't realize that they haven't gone aloft until they do.The 918th Bomb Group has run into tough times. The group is making horrendous mistakes and its commander, Colonel Keith Davenport (Gary Merrill), does his best to cover for them. The commanding general, General Pritchard (Millard Mitchell of Thieves' Highway) decides to relieve Davenport and replace him with General Savage. The chief reasons for Davenport's dismissal is he keeps an eye on his men like a vigilant mother, flies every crucial mission with them, and the strain of overidentifying with them has interfered with their efficiency. Savage is a likable enough guy until he climbs out of his staff car moments before it rolls into the 918th base. He has been riding up with his sergeant chauffeur and apparently doesn't pull rank until he finishes his cigarette, climbs into the backseat and lets his sergeant wheel him onto the premises. Savage chews out the base M.P. and orders him to scrutinize everybody, even the highest ranking generals before he allows them on base. Once Savage has arrived, he cannot find any of the commanding officers. One of the arguments that led to having Savage step into Davenport's shoes concerned a navigator, Lieutenant Zimmerman (Lee MacGregor), who committed suicide when he was relieved of duty after Davenport was sacked for incompetence.Meanwhile, Savage learns that it isn't going to be a picnic rebuilding morale. The 918th group pilots and crews worshipped Davenport, so Savage pours on the pressure enough that he earns the sobriquet Irontail. He doesn't cut them any slack and makes the men fly practice missions to improve their skills. He relieves Lieutenant Colonel Gately (Hugh Marlowe of Desperate Siege) and accuses him of cowardice for abandoning his post as camp commander and getting drunk after Zimmerman killed himself. Savage forces Gately to paint the name 'Leper Colony' on his B-17 and every member of the crew will be those fliers who screw up. Savage requires that Gately fly every mission. The blood really turns bad when Savage learns that everybody in the group has put in transfer papers. Savage's older adjutant Major Stovall (Dean Jagger of Bad Day at Black Rock) arranges it so that it takes a long time for their papers to make it through the proper channels, thus giving Savage a chance to win the men over to his brand of command.Twelve O'Clock High in some ways resembles a sports movie where a new coach must win the trust and respects of his team before he can lead them to victory. Along the way, the coach has to lay down the law with his men to develop discipline. Bartlett and Lay have done a grand job of having our hero blow in out of nowhere, read everybody the riot act, and then challenge them to accomplish more than they imagined. The only signs of sentimentality that descend come near the end with Savage's breakdown. King and his scenarists manage to pull it off, but they come narrowly close to blowing it. Interestingly, Bartlett has the distinction of flying as the bombardier in the lead plane on the first bombing mission over Berlin in March of 1942. Moreover, he was the first American to drop bombs on Berlin. Bartlett's co-scenarist Beirne Lay, Jr., flew bombing missions over Germany and was shot down in France where the French Resistance helped him escape.Twelve O'Clock High was a new breed of war film that could never have been made during World War II because it deals with the psychological friction among Americans as they rebel against one of their own and the protagonist's efforts to bring them around to his way of thinking even when he suffers a nervous breakdown. Gregory Peck is absolutely spellbinding as a martinet with a human side who must make miracles happen. Hugh Marlowe gives him a run for his money as the discredited Lieutenant Colonel Gately. Marlowe is simply terrific in a role that has every bit as much nuance as Peck's protagonist. Credit must also be given to the Allied photographers who lensed footage under actual combat conditions as well as Luftwaffe footage. King blends them almost seamlessly in with the movie mock-ups of the B-17 Flying Fortresses. Twelve 0'Clock High surpasses its closest competitor Command Descision as a better movie largely because it gets off the ground in his last half-hour.

His job is to get his men comfortable with the idea of dying so that they'll be fearless in the air; but the movie suggests that the price a leader pays for being good at his job is to risk losing his sense of humanity.I always think it's interesting to watch films made in the few years following the end of a prolonged armed conflict and compare them to the films made during. Twelve O'Clock High is a far cry from the patriotic propaganda films made at the height of WWII, more The Best Years of Our Lives than Sergeant York. Henry King's film doesn't flinch from asking tough questions, and even the look of the film reflects a grimmer outlook -- its shadowy style is pure film noir.Peck is superb as the steely general, and he plays his breakdown scene with more restraint and subtlety than you might expect for a film from this time period. Gary Merrill plays the general who Peck replaces and illustrates what happens when leaders try to be friends to their subordinates -- the men feel better but make worse soldiers. Hugh Marlowe is on hand as a dead beat who redeems himself, and old character actor Dean Jagger plays Peck's right-hand man and picked up a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his efforts.The film is rather slowly paced and a bit too talky; director Henry King doesn't take an especially cinematic approach, and too often the audience feels like it's watching a stage play rather than a film.

Gregory Peck excels as the lead, and is eerily convincing when he has to go into a shell shock state. The film begins with the avuncular figure of Dean Jagger going back to see his old air base at 'Archbury', and as he stands on the runway where grass is now growing and cows graze nearby, it all comes back to him, the story of what had happened there five years earlier, in 1942 when he was one of the officers of the group of Americans with their B-17 bombers who had been sent to England to carry out the first daylight precision-bombing of the War, and make the first bombing attacks on Germany itself. The film is based on a novel and involves very profound observations on the nature of effective leadership and the psychology of war. The film is less concerned with the emotional stories of the men who get killed than it is with the psychological questions. This is most unusual for a war film. The cast is also entirely male, and no time is wasted concocting some love interest, as the time is all fully taken up with the business at hand. This is a 'no nonsense' movie. Henry King set out with the same determination to make the movie as Gregory Peck set out to bomb Germany, and nothing was going to get in the way of either of them. Gary Merrill and Hugh Marlowe are both superb in their major roles, as is Dean Jagger. With this strong cast, and all the others equally good at supporting them, an old pro at the helm, and a solid story, this film really makes the grade.

Twelve O'clock High opens with the most beautiful musical bridge I can recall, and Dean Jagger's presence, which dominates the film carries the viewer from his seat in the theater directly into the action of the film. I felt the aching nostalgia that a veteran of those days must have also felt. Henry King's quite direction in those early shots shows us the depth of feeling Mr. Stovall must have sensed when he first say the Jolly Roger mug, and we know that what follows will be exactly what happened those days.Reading the earlier comments validates all the powerful feelings I had when I first say the film in 1950 and in every viewing since, perhaps 25 or 30 viewings. I recommend watching Twelve O'clock High with Memphis Belle to understand how perceptions of that war and those days have changed and also how the b&w tells the story so much better.

In 1942, though, he participated in another first as pilot on the inaugural American daylight bombing raid over France.I asked Gen. Tibbets what the European air war was like in the very early days of American involvement. He unhesitatingly recommended Twelve O'clock High as a nearly perfect depiction of the look, the feel, the desperation of both officers and EM, the camaraderie and conflicts, and the tensions of that early period of the effort. That early period was critical since tactics and doctrines were being very painfully learned and refined at great personal cost to those early participants.Gen. Tibbets would certainly know. That a film could so well capture a point in time and give us such a deep understanding is a difficult task for any film. That it was done so well is a strong testament to Hollywood at its finest.It's interesting to note that, just as depicted in the movie, fighter opposition to bombers was lethal and intense, nearly putting a halt to daylight bombing until the hasty inclusion of the P-47 and P-38 fighters after the early attempts to fly missions with no friendly fighter protection. This film is a depiction of the period in which fighter support was almost entirely lacking.Claire L. Chennault, the American aviator who gained fame as the leader of the Flying Tigers AVG in China, had made a passionate appeal for fighter protection of bombers back in the 1930's. Army Air Corps honchos such as Hap Arnold and Ira Eaker-- here depicted as General Pritchard-- had basically chased Chennault out of the Air Force because their Bomber Doctrine posited the bombers as invincible and unstoppable. Non-team players like Chennault who disagreed vocally were run off. This bit of sad irony, of the Eaker-like Pritchard trying to hold the bombing operation together in the face of disastrously high fatalities, partly attributable to his own doctrinal bias, is uncommented on in the film or in discussions of it since.

I would attribute this to the fact that most people who rate films on IMDb are adolescents, or at least have the typical mindset, and are thus too in love with gratuitous over-the-top scenes of sex, violence, and foul language in the cinema, as if such sensationalism expresses realism. What this folk fail to realize is that the french new wave cinema movement, for instance, was inspired by the realism of such work as Welles' masterpiece... Twelve O'clock High is no different. In fact, the air combat sequences in the film are actually footage from World War II--not that it matters, of course. What makes a good film, if we suppose film is art, and not just entertainment (which we should, as long as we're going to rate films), is a good story, good acting, and good filming technique(s). In more or less words; this film has all three of these things... A very good script, exciting film-making techniques (i.e. realistic battle scenes, variety of shots/cuts, no awkward time gaps between scenes), and an especially moving performance by Gregory Peck, make this film...a very good one. I wouldn't expect anybody to watch films like this one again and suddenly realize the quality of them, but the fact that 12 O'clock High has a rating of 7-something, and films like Fight Club and Scarface are rated higher than it, makes one seriously wonder how we (have decided) to determine what constitutes a good film to begin with.

Peck achieves success against the German enemy and deals with the air corps drive for maximum effort--partly an experiment to find out how much stress pilots can take before cracking. The venue is an American airfield in England during the early days of U.S. involvement before air superiority was established and while B-17 losses were high.Outstanding performances by Dean Jagger as the adjutant/ground exec (for which he won a best supporting actor Oscar) and Hugh Marlowe as the deadbeat son and grandson of distinguished generals round out a terrific cast.

The acting is, in fact, near-perfect... for this particular film, in this particular era of film-making. To question whether the film is technically accurate, similarly, is to forget that it is, ultimately, an entertainment, not reality, nor even a documentary.Looked at as a complete work, Twelve O'Clock High is very close to perfect. It tells a tense, involving story about war... cleverly, without leaving the ground. It creates a mood, a strong sense of time and place. Who cares if that place really existed? It's vividly real to me, every time I see this film. The film establishes it's own logic, and finds a fitting resolution within it. Which is the textbook definition of satisfying drama.Twelve O'Clock High compares well to other unrealistic films like Casablanca; it's not trying to document World War II as such, but the mark that World War II left in the minds of those who experienced it.

He simply was in a comfortable chair, on-stage with an Oriental carpet and a side table and lamp, he spoke at length of his career and experiences, showed excerpts of his films, and took questions from the audience.. Afterwards there was a patron's reception backstage, with about 40 people, along with Mr. Peck and his wife. In addition to a few words to the group, he sat and visited at every 2- or 4-person table for five minutes or so, and posed with anyone wanting pictures. As handsome and in full possession of all faculties as when he made this film 47 years prior, you could never meet an iconic celebrity of his stature who could be more genuinely polite and gracious. Even more evident of this was the way he really conversed with everyone, responded to them, and listened to them, too. This is rare even for polite, gracious persons of this stature. I was a fan of his films as a small boy, and enjoy them today, perhaps even a bit more since this meeting. This film is one of his best. Its date of release - in 1949 - I feel gives it the best perspective possible of WW II; not as patently rah-rah as the John Wayne-type flicks made during the war, and with a more accurate, current perspective than those made later. Peck and Gary Merrill (two years older in real life) are a tad young to have held the ranks portrayed, even in wartime where promotions come faster - but both effect a mature look which obviates this. Dean Jagger, one of the great all-time character actors, performs as would be expected here, and all supporting cast members are believable and engaging in their performances. The noir quality is a strong characteristic, and it would have been a shame for this film to have been done in color. The settings evoke a perfect picture of wartime 1940's England - damp, gray and beset by war (albeit filming was completed at base facilities in Alabama and Florida as well as abroad). This film is a perfect companion to Bridge on the River Kwai Black/white versus color; European theater versus Pacific; American military personnel versus British; lower-key production versus more lavish, although equally effective. In fact, I rate this film a notch higher than ...River Kwai within the excellent category.(The only real criticism I could levy on this film is Peck's character violating the cardinal rule for officers (or civilian leaders) to praise in public, censure in private. This is an emphatic principle in the military services. In this picture, during the first half of the story, Gregory not only chewed-out those with whom he had a complaint in the briefing and debriefing sessions - they usually stood while being admonished. Such criticisms should have been given only generally in meetings, and specifics voiced to the individuals privately. This could be attributed in-part, probably, due to time constraints and scene limitations for the picture, and such rules are more likely to be breached during actual war than during pure training situations. Whatever, this aspect still doesn't keep this from being a truly outstanding film.)

However, in the final years of the war, and in the years that followed, audiences became less interested in screen heroics celebrating the fighting man, with taste shifting toward examining the effect of the conflict on all of those involved. Among these were psychological examinations of the stress that warfare placed on the combatants, a theme and topic that was fresh and relevant to audiences.Perhaps the most notable such film was TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH (1949). Sy Bartlett and Bernie Lay, Jr. wrote the script from their own novel. Released as one of the first cycle of films as World War II began to be examined again in postwar years, TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH reflected the discovery of human limitations. Despite the wartime content, dealing with a bomber squadron, the emphasis is almost entirely on the relationships among the men as seen on the ground, with only one sequence of aerial combat. Both the anxieties of the fliers themselves as well as the responsibilities of their officers are recognized, unlike the emphasis on the upper echelons, as in COMMAND DECISION (1948). TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH was widely acclaimed upon its release for courageously portraying a stark theme which was relatively new to the screen.Brilliantly contextualizing the main narrative of TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH is a framing device. The former secretary of the squadron, played by Dean Jagger, is in London, alone, in the present day. In the window of an antique shop he finds an old mug that used to be prominently placed in the officer's mess. Bicycling out to the flying field, the sights and sounds of the war gradually come back to him. Jagger's character relives in memory--in the uninterrupted main body of the film--the saga of the tenure of a squadron commander, a story in which Jagger is a supporting character.In TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH, Gregory Peck, one of the new stars emerging in the late 1940s, portrays a brusque commanding officer who refuses to believe in any such notion as battle fatigue. He is replacing Gary Merrill, a weary officer who has, nonetheless, retained his essential humanity. By contrast, Peck's character, appropriately named Frank Savage, believes that rigid discipline will solve all, and he is placed in charge of a air squadron with frayed morale and nerves. Ultimately it is Peck himself who discovers the human toll war places on the servicemen; he abruptly finds himself unable to climb into his bomber cockpit and is rendered mute. It is only this uncontrollable physical and psychological breakdown that transforms a martinet into a figure deserving of sympathy and understanding. He must be replaced, since the task of both the mission and the squadron are larger than the individual performing them.TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH was also adapted by Quinn Martin Productions into a television series on ABC for three years, from 1964-67.

Unlike many war movies, which had the soldiers fighting blindly, going grimly into battle without knowing why, this one makes the point that the men perform better knowing what their objectives are. In other words, the whole issue of war as reducing man to his basest state is touched on very neatly.

Gregory Peck, earning a fourth Oscar nomination for the role, plays General Savage of the USA Eighth Air Force based in England. Casualties are high as the B-17's must fly during daylight in an era before RADAR and other technologies. After he dismisses a popular but battle fatigued Commander, chief-of-staff pipe-smoking Savage is re-assigned from his cozy office to the front lines. What results is a study in leadership as Savage instills a vigorous camaraderie among his men and flies with them on bombing raids. But ultimately he succumbs like the Commanders before him to nervous breakdown.Twelve O'Clock Hight is at once a gung-ho patriotic reaffirmation of the good fight, yet also gives an anti-war message about the brutality of a world at war. The all-male cast give superb performances and Dean Jagger (as Major Harvey Stovall) won an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor. Production all round is first-rate including real footage of dogfights and bombing raids and the the most famous (to that day) action stunt of all time when stunt pilot Paul Mantz crash lands a B-17.

The 918th bomber regiment, flying into Europe to deliver their payload to German targets, is a group suffering from low morale and even worse luck, with many pilots coming back dead, injured, or psychologically scarred from their daylight raids that are only growing tougher. Enter General Savage, played by Peck, who believes the problem lies with their CO, Colonel Davenport, a good soldier who has become too close to his men and thus lacks the necessary strong-arm discipline. Savage relieve the Colonel of his command, and brings the 918th under his wing, attempting to whip this hard luck group into shape. The film deals with the theme of leadership under stress, and how a commander will toe the line between protecting his men and sending them to their deaths. For a psychological drama on the effects of war on the chain of command, the film is undoubtedly good. Any military buff or WWII geek will get his worth for watching it. But for those interested in the actual bombing missions, bad news, as there is one bombing run and it only lasts for ten minutes in the last fourth of the movie. It consists of genuine war footage spliced in with the actors, and while it's certainly an effective sequence, it arrived too little too late to save the story, as I had already lost interest. The issue I took with the film was my lack of connection with any of the characters in the squadron, save for Savage. In the beginning, we are introduced to a man we think is the protagonist, who has a flashback to the events that sets the plot in motion; but it turns out he's only a side character who hardly has an effect on the story. If any character is the main one, it should have been Peck's Savage, but we don't meet him until twenty minutes in. There is also a distinct lack of notable personalities in the bomber crews Savage is attempting to win over. Essential scenes that would be obligatory in the telling of the tale are skipped over or told from an offhand source. In a pivotal moment, Savage is convinced his men will transfer out instead of staying. But another officer rushes in and informs him that all the men forgave their transfer orders, and opted to stay with the group. Surely this would have been a case where we should be shown this, and not just told in an anticlimactic fashion. Perhaps seeing the men all threatening to leave, but one brave soul tears up his transfer order, and the rest soon follow in an honourary echo. But because we never see this (indeed, barely see any of the grunts; most of the runtime is devoted to Peck's static character) the result of Savage's salvation is not convincing. Surely this imaginary scene I described would have given me a character in the group with a justifiable personality, who I would later then care about as much as Savage apparently does when they bite the dust at the end. But no, the 918th are just a faceless mass of men who we get glimpses of, but never get to really know. There are a couple choice scenes of men venting about why he's a bad commander, but we never get to see Savage do anything resentful or in any serious conflict with the group. The moments where bonds are forged and brotherhood is found, the battle scenes, are nonexistent except for one. The worst thing we see him do is close the bar for a night. There is also a subplot where he gives command to a deadbeat officer, in charge of a plane called the Leper Colony, and filled with the worst crewmen in the bomber group. Savage threatens to to rub his face in the dirt with this detail. But this relationship is soon forgotten by the director as well. It is at least resolved later in a touching scene at the hospital between Savage and the officer. It is revealed the man went through great personal sacrifice, having had to ditch the plane in the English Channel, and flying three missions with a fractured vertebrae. Again, the film makes a point of not throwing any of this exciting, hair raising action, but are instead just told about it. This starts to make the film bleed into monotonous scenes of indistinguishable sludge after a while. As the movie drags on, we do not get any of the bomber crew members showing up as major characters, and we don't see them struggling to get on with the General even as he flies on offscreen missions with them. All we get is exposition in the officer's club, with the generals and majors deciding on how best to run the unit. It's all very meticulous and cold, but lacks the humanity to make me care. The climax of the film involves General Savage having a nervous breakdown, as he ironically becomes too attached to his men for his own good. Let me go on to say that this is soon resolved in an almost arbitrary fashion, and the ending is as carefree and bland as could possibly be. For a detailed look into a commander's effort to run a regiment, there is much for the war buff. But the bomber crews seem to take a backseat to one man's struggle, and this just isn't enough to keep me invested for a two hour runtime.6.9/10 "},{"Title":"The Best","Date":"21 July 2015","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, War","Review":" This movie is just plain out incredible.

In fact, I was surprised to find that the film wasn't nominated for an Oscar for its editing. The sound was nominated for an Oscar, though, and the film's general level of technical proficiency no doubt helped it to secure a Best Picture nomination.All in all, Twelve O'Clock High is a worthy WWII classic.

He is a no-nonsense, no-excuses, get-the-job-done kind of guy.  The most interesting parts of the movie are the vintage aerial war footage and, more importantly, Savage's interactions with his men and his struggles to find the right balance of leadership discipline and sympathy.Maj. Harvey Stovall (Dean Jagger) is the adjutant (paper-pusher) for the commander, and is a warm counterpoint to Savage's sternness.  He provides the human bridge to the men that Savage needs.  The movie begins and ends with a scene of him after the war, but these scenes add almost nothing to the plot and should have been deleted since the movie runs a bit too long (2 hours, 12 minutes).I found the acting to be theatrical, as was common at the time of the filming (1949), but wore well once I grew accustomed to it.  Conversations between characters seemed forced sometimes in order to abbreviate them (at least once ending with `Well, that's that,' as if that could end most any conversation).

It is 1943, and the USAAF is mounting a major daylight bombing offensive against Germany from its bases in England.  The great advantage of of daylight raids is the enhanced precision, but the toll in lives and nervous strain is high.  Colonel Keith Davenport (Gary Merrill) commands the 918th, a notorious 'hard luck outfit', and though his men adore him, his leadership style simply isn't working.  He is treating discipline too lightly and driving himself too hard.  Over-identification with his men, is how Brigadier Frank Savage defines it.  Savage (Gregory Peck) is a good, kind man with an excellent service record, and when davenport is stood down, command of the 918th passes to him.    Things change instantly.  Savage roasts a sentry as he enters the base because the sentry did not scrutinize his papers closely enough.  From now on, the 918th will be committed to 'maximum effort'.  Daylight bombing might win the war, and Savage isn't going to allow any failure.  In the scene where he tears into Ben Gateley (Hugh Marlowe) for being a slack officer, Savage's stillness is awesome.  He has the might of the Air Force behind him, and he knows it.    Harvey Stovell is the adjutant, and the spiritual barometer of the entire Bomb Group.  Genial, wise Harvey (Dean Jagger) was a country lawyer back in peacetime, and as he draws on his pipe we can sense his emotional balance and homespun goodness.  Like the men, Harvey had a deep affection for Davenport.  He bristles at the methods of the new commander, but gradually learns to trust Savage and to work with him.  He delays transfer requests in order to buy time for Savage, and because Harvey is our yardstick of human decency, we respect Savage along with him.    Some minor quibbles may be cited.  Listening on the wireless to the Benedict Arnold of World War Two, Lord Haw Haw, was a serious criminal offence.  Would USAAF officers allow the broadcast to wash over them so casually?  Did Brigadier Generals REALLY pilot bombers on daylight raids, as Savage does?  It is hard to believe that senior officers stowed away on combat missions at all, let alone with the frequency suggested here.    The airborne sequences are great, making clever use of real-life newsreel footage.  Gregory Peck is marvellous as the strong man who eventually begins to crack.  His attempt to stifle tears, and his faltering failure to haul himself into the bomber are very moving.  The violence of war has ravaged his leadership qualities, and this is symbolised by the backdraft of the propellors sweeping away his cap.  Our relief when the engines stop is a clever comment on the air crews' battle fatigue.    The film opens with a woollen-suited Harvey cycling through peaceful English countryside.  The war has been over for some years, and Harvey is revisiting his old airfield.  We see the runway, hear an ominous chord in the incidental music, and then the roar of the engines.  We have been whisked effortlessly back to 1943, and Harvey is now in uniform.  This visual elegance is symptomatic of a well-made, intelligent piece of cinema.

But I found Peck's depiction of Brig. Gen. Frank Savage too harsh and unforgiving to be believable. Example after a particularly successful bombing raid, a fellow officer suggests to Savage that giving a weekend pass to London would be nice gesture. What? and buy their loyalty? is his response. He ignores similar entreaties from Major Doc Kaiser (Paul Stewart) and the unit's former commanding officer Col. Keith Davenport (Gary Merrill).Early on, after Savage shows what kind of officer he's going to be--busts a sentry for waving his car through, busts a sergeant for not wearing his uniform, closes down the officer's club, etc., every airmen vote with his feet and puts in for a transfer. Savage conspires with his ground officer Maj. Harry Stovall (Dean Jagger) to delay their transfers to buy him time to win them over before the mass exodus from the unit comes to the attention of the Inspector General, which would make him lose his command. The big day comes, and Peck is packing up his desk, assuming that he will be sent back to Washington, but instead, every man withdraws his transfer and Savage stays. Somehow I find it most unconvincing that these men would be loyal to a commanding officer who had earlier told them that they were already dead! By the time Savage has a mental breakdown as he's about to go out on a bombing mission, we're supposed to be sympathetic, but all I could think of was well, it's about time you got yours.I think the movie would have been more convincing if there was some effort to make Savage more of a sympathetic character, a love interest perhaps--there are no women in this film except as nurses and canteen workers. Or if more screen time had been devoted to the airmen as they slowly, grudgingly came to accept Savage. But no, instead we get two hours of Gregory Peck being a jerk. "}]
