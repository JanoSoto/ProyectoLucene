I first heard of Nostradomus when I watched an In Search Of.. special on his life and times. They said he predicted King Henry's death in a jousting tournament and all kinds of other things. I remember watching this film in the 1980s and it scared me to death, especially the part in the end about the third Anti-Christ, the evil Warlord in a blue turban who will start WWIII. When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, I read an article that said he was the third anti-Christ and it scared me even more. I served in Desert Storm with the National Guard and I can remember all the time I was over there I thought the world was going to end just like it showed in this ridiculous film, I about drove myself crazy worrying over nothing! My father always used to tell me that I was foolish even thinking about Nostrodomus. Well anyway, I read a book on this prophet by a man named James Randi and he pointed out that Nostrodomus was really a fraud. His predictions are so vague that they can be twisted and turned to mean almost anything. All right, he talks about something called Hister in his predictions, in this movie they try to make it out like he predicted the rise of Adolf Hitler. But if you do a little bit of studying, you find Hister was the name of a river in France! Friends there is nothing to worry about! In the wake of these terrorist attacks, people have tried to make it out like he predicted those as well. Dont make the mistake I did, its not even worth thinking about. Orson Welles has a great narrator's voice and makes the story come alive, but just watch it and laugh. Looking back, I feel so foolish that I let this film frighten me so much, I should have listened to my father.

Be it a flood, an earthquake, an assassination, or anything in-between, the sixteenth century French cleric wrote about it, somehow, in the midst of his hundreds of ambiguous quatrains. His writings have become the nonbelievers' Book of Daniel and the Revelations of St. John the Divine, reference works almost occult in stature about the future of the human race.As a potential source for a 'cheap buck', his writings are invaluable, as they can so easily be twisted to mean ANYTHING, so low-budget documentaries pop up frequently with definitive interpretations, and THE MAN WHO SAW TOMORROW is, perhaps, the most famous of the lot. Best-known for having Orson Welles, looking suitably Satanic, as the Host/Narrator, pouring over ancient documents and looking up at the camera as if he were 'channeling' Nostradamus' spirit, himself (Once a ham actor, always a ham actor...), the documentary jumps to stock footage of natural disasters, the Nazis, Hollywood renditions of Napoleon, and newsreels of John and Robert Kennedy, all the while stating how dictators ('Anti-Christs'), Popes, Kings and Presidents' lives and deaths were foreseen with unerring accuracy.The problem arises when the 'future' is predicted, using his writings. Whether our world survives or falls into chaos, there has NEVER been a 'fortuneteller' who predicted what lies ahead correctly. It is only AFTER the fact that one can 'interpret' the writings to 'fit' what has happened. It reminds one of the old joke about fortunetellers...if they are so accurate, why aren't they all rich from winning lotteries, horse races, and such? From Nostradamus to contemporary 'visionaries' like Jeanne Dixon, what HASN'T happened that was 'predicted' as coming to pass always trips them up...while their supporters quickly offer excuses that we simply 'misinterpreted' what was foreseen.So don't face what lies ahead with fear, when watching THE MAN WHO SAW TOMORROW...just enjoy it for the cheesy spectacle it is, and perhaps mourn the fact that non-film fans may remember Orson Welles more from his overripe performance, here, than for CITIZEN KANE or TOUCH OF EVIL.Nostradamus probably predicted THAT, too...

I wonder if they still have it, they should be ashamed of themselves if they show it to any more classes, I was just a teenager, but these were educated adults taking this nonsense seriously. I saw it again recently, I remember being absolutely mesmerized by it at the time, I'm almost embarrassed that I was ever naive enough to take this for anything more than base entertainment. The whole production is just so cheap and silly looking, and most of the predictions haven't panned out, I'm sure Nostrodamus was a slick talking con man of his time, sort of like Sylvia Brown now, just say a lot of vague things and hope people overlook it when your wrong. All of that being said, Orson Wells has a great presence, and he almost makes this tripe seem plausible, if you close your eyes.

Michel de Nostradamus prophetized that the people's princess would get killed in a moving metallic object. We just recently passed the 25th anniversary of Grace Kelly's death and the 10th anniversary of Princess Diana's death, both in car wrecks.But there's more. According to Nostradamus, the third Antichrist (the first two being Napoleon and Hitler) would rise to power in the Middle East during the period of about 1994-1999 and launch an attack on a great city near the 45th parallel, which narrator Orson Welles says would probably be New York. How true it all came, even if this is all a matter of interpretation.Overall, the movie leaves it up to us to decide whether or not we believe that Nostradamus was right. Although you gotta admit that they make a pretty convincing case. Welles, speaking in a no-nonsense tone and smoking a cigar, creates a rather eerie feeling...the kind of eerie that makes you truly respect the work that they must have done to put this movie together.So, I recommend this one. While some of Nostradamus's prophecies obviously didn't come true, it's truly scary how accurate others turned out to be. As for the third Antichrist - presumably Osama bin Laden - plunging the world into a massive war, the Bush family's business ties to the bin Laden family have certainly turned the world into a powder keg. As for the future, we'll just have to see how things turn out. Worth seeing.PS this was the second time that Orson Welles narrated a movie. The previous one was the 1975 documentary Bugs Bunny Superstar, a look at the early days of Termite Terrace, padded with nine classic cartoons.

Certainly to no one reading these reviews, and even in 1981, he was getting some of the underground appeal. By the time this film came out, he entered into super fame status thereafter.This film is a great visual piece, and I think it should be of note that even narrator Orson begins by saying this film is not his idea, inferring that he is not sold on Nostradamus.And so, Orson does a fantastic narration, which in view of his denial of belief, makes this a great acting job on his behalf.I was never sold on the prophecies, and neither were most of us in the arts, because we could see how vague the quatrains were. Give enough vague verses, and they have to come true across the globe over hundreds of years.The only amazing thing is that less that 100% of them came true so far, in some interpretation. That would be amazing.The legend of Nostradamus is very akin to Tyrone Power in NIGHTMARE ALLEY. The con approach is to be general enough, and hit upon items that can have many meanings. I practiced this myself around 1990 with some friends, and scared them senseless with one quatrain, which incidentally came totally true on 9-11-01. I wasn't being insightful. I just knew that twin towers, Sun falling, and other phrases could have dozens of meanings. Twin towers could mean basketball players, Minnesota cities, the buildings, and who knows what else.So, it isn't to be taken seriously. It's fun and games, this film is. And it is great fun and games. Very interesting, very well done, very entertaining. Thumbs up.

My copy is so blurry now it is hard to watch. The interesting thing to consider is that this movie was produced in 1981. Half of the movie deals with the past from the 1981 prospective. The movie points out the nearly correct predictions of the past. The producers never said he was dead on every prediction. Rather it was uncanny how he was able to closely describe events of the future and was fairly close on details. What is more interesting now that the film is 34 years old is that the predictions laid out in the movie have indeed happened or are happening. Ignorance would cast these closely described descriptions as smoke and mirrors. For instance the prediction that man made mountains in the new world (there was no NYC when he wrote it) would be destroyed by attacks by the Middle East....hmmm. The movie depicted it as missiles being launched across the sea when in reality it was planes launched from airports in the US but directed by middle east sponsored terrorists....nahh ridiculous right? A third Antichrist, purple turbin, Middle East...ridiculous??? Anyone seen the videos of the ISIS folks beheading, crucifying and burning people? Nahhhh, ridiculous again. The movie is worth considering, not sell all possessions and bunker down but have an ear up for the awareness the film and the predictions offer. It is worth considering. Be careful of the demonstrative individuals who can absolutely assert that nothing prophesied is ever going to happen.

There are a lot of holes in the Nostradamus' predictions so I tend to chalk it up as nothing more than an interesting curiosity.The documentary The Man Who Saw Tomorrow doesn't see it that way. Here is a movie that offers a tiny bit of biography about the supposed prophet, and then cobbles together footage from every source under the sun in an effort to prove his accuracy. Did he have fore-knowledge of the future? Did he accurately predict The French Revolution? Napoleon? The American Revolution? The Civil War? The rise of Hitler? World War II? The Atomic Bomb? The Kennedy Assassination? The Moon Landing? Is he also right in his prediction about World War III and the end of the world? Well, I don't happen to think so, but I am confused about whether the movie does. It spends 90 minutes reiterating that Nostradamus wrote down 2000 years worth of prophecies that came true and then adds a tag at the end to tell us that the producers of this film are actually less convinced of his accuracy than I am.Hosted by Orson Welles, who sits in his stuffy office behind a desk smoking a cigar, The Man Who Saw Tomorrow attempts to lay out all of the major turning points of history by way of Nostradamus' writing. Before diving head-long into his predictions, we learn that Nostradamus was a hard working student who had ambitions to be a doctor but after losing his family in the plague, turned his ambitions toward writing down his predictions in quatrains, hiding his verses in anagrams and secret code in an effort to avoid being prosecuted for witchcraft. Early on, we learn, he kissed the robes of a young Franciscan friar who would someday be Pope Sixtus V. Later he was invited to the home of a dignitary where he accurately predicted which pig they would be eating. Curiously, he forgot to jot those things down.The historical predictions put forth by Nostradamus are interesting, but the methods in which the movie presents them are, in a word, baffling. Nothing is off limits here. There is footage of the Kennedy assassination, the holocaust, The Moon Landing, the revolution in Iran. Then, for events where there is no footage, sometimes actors are used in recreations and other times we get footage from old movies like War and Peace. Sprinkled into the mix also are old newsreels, short films, documentary footage, illustrations and cheap special effects shots from old science fiction movies.The only center of logic in this chaotic jumble is a very brief interview with former astronaut Edgar Mitchell who argues that the future is nothing more than our summation of present events. I think I would have liked to have heard more from him and less from Jean Dixon, who appears absurdly satisfied that she predicted the deaths of both John and Bobby Kennedy. That's before Welles informs us that we can see Nostradamus' accuracy if we simply keep one eye on the quatrains and the other on our daily newspaper. For me, that's just too much work. I think I'll just let the future surprise me.The movie keeps insisting over and over that Nostadamus laid out a historical time line the revealed three men who would try to take over the world &#x96; Anti-Christs he called them. The first was Napoleon, the second was Hitler and the third is said to be a future tyrant who will come from the Middle East. This man, it is said, will plunge the world into a catastrophic war that will last 4 and 20 years, whatever that means.That prediction lays out the film's final act in which Nostradamus apparently predicted that a Middle Eastern Warrior in a blue turban would start World War III at or about May of 1988. That leads to an embarrassingly silly scene with cheap sets right out of Battlestar Galactica, with the governments of both The Middle East and The United States firing nukes at each other until civilization is obliterated. After that, the movie helpfully reminds us that Nostradamus predicted a thousand years of peace before the world ends in 3797.The Man Who Saw Tomorrow is nothing more than a curiosity. Any attempt to take it seriously the requires the kinds of fruitless insights than are often attached to things like The Da Vinci Code, Roswell or Bigfoot. I'm no skeptic but I had to smile at most of this. It is a professionally made film that probably takes its subject more seriously than it should. I find the predictions of Nostradamus to be a curious but not essential element to human history. He seemed to have a good track record even if he did predict that Ted Kennedy would become President of the United States in 1984. Hey, nobody's perfect.

Bush the Senior and Bush the Junior?!) and he'll come in the seventh month of 1999 (Remeber the American Presidancy elections Exit William Clinton and Enter G. W. Bush ??!!), he'll return the legacy of Ghengis Khan the king of Mongols (Bush invaded Afghanistan and Iraq, he's quite controlling Pakistan by controlling Musharaf, and is threatening Iran and wants to invade it and also he's tampering with China) ..don't all that remind us with the way of Ghengis Khan) ..

The smoke from our host's ever-present cigar lends a dignified air of mystery which frames the film well.Much attention is paid to Nostradamus' concept of the Antichrist Napoleon and Adolf Hitler, both Antichrists, and a third whom the seer referred to in his quatrains as Mabus. Mabus has yet to be definitively identified; he could be a mighty world leader or an obscure subversive. (Some have even suggested that Mabus could be the name of a powerful weapon or bomb.) With Mr. Welles' unexpected death in 1985, we lost one of our most impassioned Mabus hunters. In the days that followed, as the world mourned and came to grips with its loss, sadness and confusion gave way to suspicion and conspiracy. Today, twenty years later, the same question is still on everybody's mind Did this Mabus contrive to eliminate Mr. Welles before he could unmask Nostradamus' dreaded third Antichrist?

If you have actually researched Nostrodamus, as I have, you will realize that at the time Nostrodamus lived, witchcraft was highly feared and punished by death. In order to protect himself and yet still document his visions, he was forced to code them by using multiple languages and adding some jibber-jabber. I watched this film many many years ago and have also read Nostrodamus' notes. Certain quatrains were represented differently in the film then what has actually happened. The talks about the nuclear detonation in NYC at the end, or future part of the film have clearly been misrepresented. After 9/11 we can now distinctly see what was being discussed. Also, a 25 year war is mentioned in the film. When I first saw this many years ago It was hard for me to understand a war lasting that long. but now, it can be seen logically that the War on Terror could possibly last 25 years because it is unlike any other war ever fought in the past. Lastly, it was said in the movie that this war will be preceded by a number of catastrophic natural disasters unlike any EVER seen in history. If you have been watching the world news in the past few years, well...remember the devastating earthquake in Turkey in 1999 that killed thousands, the great Indonesian tsunami of 2004, and more recently hurricane Katrina...dwell on that and do as much research as possible before drawing conclusions, and keep in mind this film was made in 1981.

He was reputed to have predicted(through the use of coded writings to safeguard against the church) future events like the rises of Napolean and Hitler, the assassinations of U.S. Presidents Lincoln & Kennedy, and the invention of the airplane and moon rockets, among other things. A bit corny now, even if Welles does a nice job here, but viewer may get the feeling that he really doesn't believe anything he's saying, which kills the whole point of watching!

(Although lumping poor Napoleon in with Hitler is unfair.) Yes, those predictions make sense, if you are really, really interpretive.It's when Welles tries to predict the future that things become dicey. Amongst things this movie predicted- Ted Kennedy would be President. (Pretty unlikely now, eh?) An Earthquake would level Los Angeles in 1989 (um, nope). That a vast war would break out in the 1990's that would result in the rise of the THird Anti-Christ.

I never forgot it and I thought about it often through the years.After reading it, I went to the library and read, or tried to, some books on M. Nostradamus.  Very hard reading, might I add.18 years later, after I brought up the fact, I watched the documentary again with a friend, only to find that since watching it the first time, the earthquake he predicted in CA--came true.  That was eerie.Yes, Orson Wells, with his dark demeanor, does a fantastic job bring the film to life.  Truth or Ficton?  Many of his predictions have come true...you will have to decide for yourself, but what's really amazing is the fact that Nostradamus was born in 1503, he would have had no idea, or no way, of accurately putting into words what he saw in his visions...never having seen a sky-scraper before, or a plane, etc., etc.  Take it for what it's worth.  But keep in mind that perhaps he had those visions for a reason...read the bible, read revelations, maybe he was trying to tell us something.  Maybe we should have paid attention.I haven't seen the movie for two years, although I have wanted to since the terrorist attacks, but it has been rented out.  Did he predict the end of the world...perhaps he did..the end of the world AS WE KNOW IT.

(Iraq)He also mentions that the heir of a previous leader would be in charge at the time. (Bush Jr)He also mentions of a an anti-Christ and that it would cause a 3rd world war that would last 7 years and that an ally from the east would turn on us. (The leader of Russia has a very nasty track record, even banning the media in there country. Also this war with Georgia is due because Georgia made there own oil pipe line for there country not wanting to have anything to do with Russia. Up until then Russia had a pipe line that ran through China that was one of there main cash cows. They cut there supply off to Georgia. Georgia decided to charge less to others in the region, and have been at odds with Russia for years.. Now here is the prediction.. The USA needs to take a stance on this,.. However this could cause a war with Russia who in turn will get aid from China and most likely Cuba and the middle east. This pose's a major threat and with out troops already thinned out, this may cause a major problem for us.) THIS COULD BE THE WORLD WAR 3 he is speaking of that seems to be unfolding right now.HE WILL FEAR THE BLACK ONE. (in a word,OBAMA is all I can think of right now.

Wolper is a marvelous example of the Mysteries of the Unexplained style of documentary film-making (the type that Blair Witch and company enjoy poking fun at).  As a historical showpiece, it's amazingly on-the-mark (utilizing re-creation film pieces, stock Hollywood footage, and actual video/newsreels), while still wowing those casual viewers interested in being entertained (nee, scared right out of your wits!).The Man Who Saw Tomorrow is the amazing story of French Physician/Scholar, Michel de Nostradamus - a pious and learned man who, through some uncanny ability, had apparently predicted the events of the future with startling accuracy.  The film examines many of his key predictions and, through benefit of hindsight (and a fair amount of conjecture and theorizing), examines just how accurate his predictions of the past were... Leading to the ultimate question - what is still yet to come for us all?From the opening credits, the film immediately grabs our attention and, over the next two hours, refuses to give it back!  The opening sequence tells the story of three grave-robbers who unseal the 200-year-old coffin of Nostradamus and find a plaque with the current month and year inside. With the subsequent and predicted death of one of those who disturb the grave, we are immediately intrigued, and demand to see more... and we are not disappointed.The film tells us of the life and death of the scholar, several key events in his life (including a meeting with a future pope, the prediction of the death of the reigning king of France, and a rather amusing happenstance at a dinner party).  We begin to feel for, even care for, this poor chap who seems to have powers and abilities that he does not yet fully understand.  When he begins to write his verses of the visions that torment him, we are already consumed with the thirst for additional knowledge.The story shifts to detailed examination of Nostradamus's writings, and their eerie similarity to actual events occurring decades (or centuries) after his death.  The sequences on the French Revolution, Hitler and the Kennedys give you a shiver... particularly when it is shown that both the Allied and the Nazi forces began utilizing the writings of Nostradamus in vicious propaganda efforts.  By the time we start seeing events from our here-and-now taking shape, the repercussions of the writings become all too apparent.  When the future (from a 1980 perspective) is examined, some of it is laughable (In spite of what Nostradamus said, it is highly doubtful Ted Kennedy will EVER be president.) and some of it is quite alarming (Predictions of floods, famines, earthquakes, global wars, and wild weather have, to my satisfaction, all come quite true... just not on the fully global annihilative scale that we were led to believe.).The narration of Orson Welles (he of the grim rotundity and eternal scowl) is dead serious enough to induce the shakes at certain points.  He's kind of a loving grandfather who is only telling you this for your own good, but he still gives you the creeps.  And the assorted film montages are edited together seamlessly, so it's difficult to tell where the true footage ends and the re-creations begin (although I doubt they had film cameras available during the assault on the Tuileries in 1789).I will not debate what is/is not true based on the information in this film - that is what historians and scholars are for.  And I do not deny that Nostradamus's writings are both cryptic and vague.  I can only say that- When Band Aid, USA for Africa, Farm Aid, and Comic Relief sought to wipe out world hunger, I watched this film again.- When the massive earthquakes hit California in the late 80s, I watched this movie again.- When Sadam Hussein faced off against the world in the Persian Gulf War, I watched this movie again.- When India and Pakistan began dabbling with nuclear weapons, I watched this movie again.- And now that Iran is working on building long range surface-to-surface missile systems - allegedly with help from Russia, China, et al... Where IS that damn videotape?As a piece of historical entertainment, Man is a winner.  As a doomsday warning for the nuclear age, it's a hit.  And as a frightening piece of film-making for those who just want a good scare, this is a bona-fide hit.

Don't you see the world going in the same direction as Nostradamus's prophecies suggest? Whether you believe them or not is irrelevant compared with the fact that these prophecies are warning us of the wrong path we are taking as human beings.

Many of Nostradamus's quatrains had mutiple meanings and referred to more than one event at different times in history...this is because history repeats itself many times. Nostradamus did forsee the end of the world, but he didn't forsee it happening anywhere near anyone's lifetime...in fact, it won't end until millions of years after the human race has become extinct.  His quatrains are mis-interpreted on a massive scale. The documentary is incorrect about his prediction on 1999. It had nothing to do with the Antichrist. Although, he does predict a third Antichrist. The Antichrist is not going to come out immediately as an evil person. The Antichrist will seem to be a peace-maker in the Middle-East and will even receive the Nobel Peace Prize. When the time comes, he will make a drastic turn around and invade Europe. Although, the film was somewhat accurate in its description of how New York City will be destroyed as outlined by Nostradamus. It was actually correct in identifying Century 3 Quatrain 84 with the devastation of New York City. Although, that quatrain does not refer to the events of September 11, 2001...it still has yet to come to pass. It is a very disturbing quatrain which predicts the end of New York City.

This, of course, is different because it tells of a legendary seer named Nostradamus who accurately predicted major world events.

The  biggest problem is telling about the three Antichrists in excessive portions, creating the largest feature of all. In making this film, the producers used quite a bit of stock footage from actual Hollywood movies, which I feel was a disgrace for a documentary.

Other footage came from archived sources, including the segment on J.F.K.; the rest is substandard acting fare.
