I have to say the movie is not as graphic as the second movie, but it has a lot more to it than the first movie in the ways of scares and such and it has a nice conclusion too. Still the movie has to many 3-D moments too to be a really good movie. You know the scenes, pointless scenes where they aim something directly at the camera and such.

One that, frankly, has yet to be adapted faithfully to the big screen. Oh well, maybe some day. Meanwhile, the 1979 film adaptation was followed by one of the biggest slews of sequels in horror movie history. Like with most other franchises, the sequels really aren't necessary, but at the same time that doesn't make them bad films or no fun. This is the case with this second sequel, which took advantage of the 3-D movie craze of the early 1980s. Know what that means? You guessed it, a no-brainer excuse for state-of-the-art special effects to be thrown at the audience. In the case of this movie, that's not a totally bad thing.Pros The pace never drags. Each cast member, except for maybe Tess Harper, gives the best performance they can with the material and at least seem to be enjoying themselves. Howard Blake, replacing 1 & 2's Lalo Schifrin, composes a decent, spooky score. Director Fleischer does a good job of making the old house look menacing and gets a few other good shots too. At least a couple good chilling moments. Some of the special effects are pretty good. A powerhouse finale. Cheesy fun if you don't take it at all seriously.Cons Lacks real scares. The plot is super thin and really just an excuse for the filmmakers to use flashy effects. Loaded with haunted house clich√©s. Some cheap effects, especially that one big fly. Tess Harper is the only actor in the film who seems to be uncomfortable and therefore gives a mostly stiff performance.Final thoughts Won't stand up well to classics like 'Poltergeist' and the original 'The Haunting,' but this second sequel to the 1979 chiller is good clean fun if you're looking for nothing more than an hour and a half of entertainment. Though I enjoyed this on some level, I can see why the subsequent sequels went straight to video because the series was starting to turn into self parody at this point.My rating 3/5 "},{"Title":"Succeeds on its own modest terms","Date":"9 April 1999","Score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":"  Surprisingly, this second sequel to the supposedly fact based thriller The Amityville Horror is a worthy installment in the otherwise wretched series of shockers.  Richard Fleischer, a Hollywood veteran whose directorial credits include such diverse fare as The Vikings and The Boston Strangler, brings a skill to the proceedings that were conspicuously absent from the original film, which was more notable for the laughably bad performances of James Brolin and Rod Steiger than it was for inducing chills.  The performances in Amityville 3-D, or Amityville the Demon as it is known on television, didn't deserve Oscar consideration, but they are professional and, in the case of Candy Clark's suspicious photographer, almost inspired.The movie opens in typical haunted house fashion  a seance is being held in the notorious Long Island house where, in earlier films, toilets backed up (shudder!), marching bands played in the dead of night (shudder again!), and a giant red-eyed pig named Jody roamed the premises and engaged in small talk with children (Babe in an early role?).  The seance produces mysterious apparitions and odd noises, all of which are exposed by two of the participants--a reporter and his photographer-- as a hoax.  The realtor denies any involvement in the souped-up spookiness and explains to the reporter (Tony Roberts on holiday from Woody Allen's repertory company) that the house's infamous reputation is such that he's willing to sell it at a bargain rate.  Roberts, newly divorced and eager for a peaceful environment in which to write his great American novel, buys it, all the while ignoring the warnings of his less courageous colleague, the delightful Miss Clark.Roberts, a stubborn type who sneers at the supernatural, moves in and continues his sneering even as anyone who sets foot in the house experiences terror and, ultimately, death.  But, dumbo that he is, he continues to pooh-pooh any notions that the house is cursed.Some talented performers are on view in this film, and if not for their admirable abilities to keep a straight face, the movie would be a lot funnier than it's supposed to be and sometimes is.  Roberts is his usual non-plussed self, refusing to accept any supernatural explanations for the bizarre circumstances taking place around him.The special-effects are adequate, but they do the trick, and probably worked better in 3D, which is the way the film was presented theatrically.  The process is evident in the use of so many scenes in which hands are extended toward the camera and, in one scene, a frisbee is tossed directly at the audience.Amityville 3D will never take its place beside the greats of the horror genre, but neither will its two predecessors.  However, unlike those failed shockers, number 3 succeeds on its own modest terms, providing, amid the occasional unintended chuckle, a few moments of genuine suspense and a thrill or two.  It's a satisfying spook show on the same level as the William Castle flicks of the late 50s and early 60s (The Tingler, House on Haunted Hill, et al).

This is an entirely different story concocted by the screenwriters and I must say it's the best work of fiction on film that involves the Amityville house.The cinematography is great, the music, while not Schifrin, is still chilling, the acting is very very good. And there are some really scary moments in the film. The overall story I think engulfs the viewer. It's really interesting because the main character believes it's all a hoax, (much like a portion of the people do today) and he comes to find out that things in Amityville are much more unsettling than he thought they'd be.The only thing (as with all 80's 3-D films) is that there are obvious things going on which were supposed to lurch out at the audience. It seems rather silly when the camera stays on a certain image for more than five seconds when it is no longer presented in it's 3-D image. It induces a chuckle when ever this happens, but it doesn't detract from the film itself.

Interesting part with the Ouija and following event to create a continued rift between the father and mother. I will have to say that the house looks better in this one than it did in one and two(New Paint job I guess.) The 3-D was good as I remember it back when it was in theaters(way better than JAWS 3 but unfortunately released after. JAWS 3 ended the very short lived early 80's 3-D fad and probably killed any additional sales for this film by having it be another 3 in 3-D.)Another interesting thing to note is that the writer has added in post Amityville(True story) elements and layered it into the film in subtle ways. The whole aspect of Is this Fraud? is layered as the people performing the sceances in the house and the tabloid writing about Amityville and fraud, though it is kept just towards the medium and her husband in the film. There are real elements about the neighborhood that this house is located in and how the public has not forgotten about Amityville to the point that it made the house and I can't even unload the ones on either side of it difficult to sell or rent. No wonder with tons of people constantly coming by and trampling their lawns, though in the movie it is just because of superstition of the haunting. Later, a team of psychics with the reporter go into the house to investigate the phenomenon. Just like what really happened shortly after the Lutz family left for warmer states. Though this one was promoted even as complete fiction, it is awesome that the writer was still looking for bits of truth to weave into the film, keeping in touch with what Amityville is supposed to be.After viewing the review of Siskel and Ebert on youtube where Rog slams the story as being completely unrealistic because, Who would buy this house after what supposedly happened in 1 and 2? Well, that is what happened!Also, somehow it has circulated on the web that the character of John Baxter, portrayed by Tony Roberts, is really Dr???Steven Kaplan, critic of the validity of The Amityville Horror. The character in this film is in no way supposed to be Kaplan. It is also interesting to note the public's scrutiny of the Lutz family and The Warrens, but lack of interest in checking facts and credentials put forth by Steven Kaplan, who only claimed to hold a doctorate.

He opens the door and finds the room filled with thick clouds of steam. Waving his way through the steam he finds that the faucets in the sink are turned on full-blast with hot water. He struggles to turn them off, and after a few minutes, he does. Then the scene is finished. No ghosts, no blood, no murders, just a plumbing problem. That scene is pretty much a commentary of this terrible movie; it's needless, pointless and easily forgotten, like water running down the drain.Amityville 3-D is like an old Kleenex that missed the free-throw to the garbage can; it's disgusting and disposable. It's the kind of movie that you watch passively as your mind becomes preoccupied with all of the wonderful things that you're going to do after this movie is over. Fun things like laundry and cleaning up after the dog.If that sounds cruel, consider the mean-spirited intent that made this film possible. The two previous entries in this series, The Amityville Horror and Amityville II The Possession were very profitable at the box office, despite the fact that neither was worth the powder to blow them up. Yes, they were bad but you felt that somebody was trying. The problem is that there isn't really much to build on, once you've told the DeFeo story and then the Lutz story, there's really nowhere to go. That's good news for the filmmakers since they have clearly come into this project with no ambition to make a workable movie. The title is a brand name, and so apparently they figure that no effort is needed. Just put that creepy house in the frame, kill some people with special effects and no one has to work very hard. This isn't art; it's commercialism at its most cynical. Worse is that all the press releases for the film made clear in big block letters that this was not related to the two earlier pictures. It takes place in the same house, it has a big 3 in the title, and there are several conversations about the events that led to the first movie.Apparently these crass business people are counting on 3D to save the day. It's a crummy process, blurry and dark that adds nothing to the experience, and is only pliable so that something &#x96; a Frisbee, a metal pole, the movie's title &#x96; can come flying at the screen. That happens about every 15 minutes and it isn't worth the wait.The threading tissue that gets us from one indistinct 3D image to the next is something that might be mistaken for a story. Whereas the second Amityville adventure withered into a pathetic rip-off of The Exorcist, this film withers into a pathetic rip-off of Poltergeist. Tony Roberts plays a journalist from a tabloid rag called Reveal Magazine who doesn't believe in all the hooey about haunted houses. He and his wife (Tess Harper) are separated, and he's taken up with a new lover (Candy Clark). Still he buys the house at 112 Ocean Avenue because the Realtor is eager to unload this turkey as a bargain basement price. Roberts doesn't believe in ghosts and isn't even convinced of the validity of the supernatural claims when the Realtor drops dead on his third floor landing. He's not even convinced when ghouls start popping out of the well down in the basement. There are few things more aggravating than a horror movie with slow-learners at the fore-front.What is most frustrating about Amityville 3-D is that is breaks the first rule of haunted house movies You have to have rules. There has to be some form of establishment so the audience can understand what is at stake and what is happening. Otherwise the movie is just a free-for-all and we get a freak show without purpose. That's especially true when the movie takes the haunted house stuff away from the house. When the characters are killed in their cars miles away from the house, then we are left to wonder why. Are the people cursed? Is the car cursed? Those questions give you an even bigger headache than the 3D.Is there a high point to Amityville 3-D? Actually, yes. There's a brief performance here by a 21 year-old Meg Ryan making her feature film debut. She's bouncy and fun, but on screen in too few scenes.

John is a disbeliever and skeptic of supernatural phenomenon so he's not worried about the house's history. Once he moves in, of course, strange things start happening. Amityville 3-D has a bad reputation and most of it is deserved. The plot is tiresome and the scares are often laughable. Still, I can't help but enjoy it on some guilty pleasure level. Tony Roberts is a stiff lead. He reminds me of a less charismatic Ron Perlman. Yet there's something fascinating about watching this guy work. Maybe it's the hair. Or maybe it's that he clearly believes he is above the material. Lori Loughlin makes her film debut as his daughter. She doesn't get a lot to do but she's good enough so that you wouldn't automatically assume this was her first movie. Meg Ryan (!) plays her friend in one of Meg's early film roles. I was a little worried after Amityville II that we'd get some inappropriate sexual action between Tony Roberts and Meg Ryan or, worse yet, Roberts and Lori Loughlin. But thankfully nobody has sex with Tony Roberts. The often awful Candy Clark rounds out the main cast. She's up to her usual scenery chewing so everybody grab a seat. The best performances would come from Tess Harper as the ex-wife and Robert Joy as a paranormal investigator.Perhaps the most amusing change to the Amityville series here comes from the fact the ghosts can attack someone even if they are miles away from the house. It's silly but allows for some enjoyable shock scenes. Look, this isn't a great movie. It isn't even a good one, really. But it still entertains in a so-bad-it's-good way.

Candy Clark of American Pie fame is in the movie as well and does a good job as a nonbeliever who finally comes around to see the darkside.Another plus of this movie is there wasn't a lot of blood and guts. Perhaps this is why it is receiving the low ratings. Gore doesn't make a horror movie.Finally, this was a 3D film and the payoff in the end is good. There is even a Hitchcockian moment at the end with one 3D effect that gave me a bit of a thrill and then a chuckle after.The movie is far from a bust. Watch it and remember the context in which it was shot. Look for the gems.

I really think this was one of those movies that killed the 3D revival era of the 80s. Along with Jaws 3D, why not take the chance on a movie and make it worthwhile. A recent release in the UK offers the anaglyph (red/blue glasses) 3D version complete with the glasses, too bad the far superior polorization method (grey lens glasses) will not work with home theatre without special wired glasses that are way overpriced. I am hoping with the advent of DVD and increased clarity the US distributors see fit to re-release the 3D version as it seemed to be the only thing to give this movie that extra edge to make it even worth viewing, even if it is only anaglyph 3D. A simple plot, returning to a franchise of a haunted house in Amityville, NY this movie seems to have little to do with the other two movies, only connection I could make with the first two was that the second one was actually a pre-quel to the first movie and this was just another story in the chapter that did not feel like giving you much background on the house, assuming you have seen the other two, there was really no point to re-explain everything that happened in the past. Buy maybe not. I will save the plot line for you to read in other comments. I think poor selection of actors, overacting, common scare techniques, and just plain overdone explains this movie best. Yet, for some reason it can be enjoyed, and again, I think part of the key is experiencing the movie in it's original format, yet that would never change my opinion that this could have been so much better, the script was good enough, just very poorly executed. Not much else I can say on this one, on a rainy Sunday, nothing to do, want to watch some old horror films, hey why not do the trilogy thing. I usually don't comment on other users comments, everyone is entailed to their own, but just a reminder the first movie (and second) was loosely based on actual events, it is a real house that exists in Amityville, NY, which many people consider haunted (or was, if it is still there), and was the actual site of some very nasty murders in the 70s. It had never been proved the house is indeed haunted.

There is even less of a story this time around, merely a string of special effects and strange occurrences with different people reacting to them.There aren't many good scenes in this film. The best is probably the opening moment where a blatantly fake looking s√©ance actually does turn out to be fake. This scene plays with the audience's expectations and therefore it's probably the cleverest bit in the film. Unfortunately, after this finishes, we're back in the realms of clich√©s and contrived happenings.The acting is nothing special, the cast is made up of nobodies, apart from a young Meg Ryan who probably leaves this off her CV these days. It's not that the film is exceptionally bad, it's just identical to many other haunted house films of the time, including the original, so it's just not memorable at all. In fact I find it hard to remember what actually happened throughout the film, other than the supernatural phenomenon.Which leaves the special effect as the best things in the film. It was actually filmed in 3D, which means that at every opportunity something will be thrown at the screen and at the audience. Silly, yes. The one spooky moment is where a man is attacked and killed by flies which swarm on his face. A female photographer notices that his face is obscured - almost mutilated - on the photographs she has of him. This is pretty disturbing.There is a car crash, a rotted corpse and, best of all, at the end, a hilarious big bald demon which sits in a well and looks like an overweight version of Yoda, except with worse special effects. It must have had a flamethrower in its mouth too, judging by the flames which spurted out at the camera. After that, the house, obviously made of polystyrene, collapses and explodes, and, surprise, surprise, there is a whole plethora of bits of debris hitting and flying at the camera.This film is a clich√©d mess, plain and simple, with only some unintentional humour at the poor nature of the dialogue and the effects to while away the time.

But Amityville 3 doesn't even stack up to Friday the 13th part 3 or Jaws 3. It may however be better than Treasure of the Four Crows, but that is hardly a ringing endorsement. Despite what appears to be a strong cast, and an intriguing premise, Amityville 3 quickly dissolves into a tame special effects dominated rip-off of Poltergeist.Having never seen part 2 of this series, I will have to assume this story somewhat picks up where the prior film left off. We begin with a reporter investigating the house of record which is currently occupied by scam artists living off the place's reputation. Once they are gone, the reporter is offered the chance to buy the house dirt cheap. He being recently divorced, and needing a quiet space to write a novel, decides to take the chance. Take it from this writer; solitude can be helpful, provided your house is neither haunted like this one, nor a dump like my old place in Lincoln. Anyway, even BEFORE this guy moves in, people start turning up dead around the place. Still, like all horror movie morons, he moves in. He even sets up a room in the notorious attic for his teen-aged daughter when she is able to visit. By the end of the film, we might as well be calling her Carol Ann.I won't say much more about this plot, since it moves ahead predictably, and without too many scares. Probably the most entertainment one can garner from these early 80s 3D movies is laughing at the obvious prop setups they need to remind you why you shelled out an extra buck or two for the glasses. There are several instances of objects (like the customary flies of this series) buzzing right in front of the camera. Also stationary objects such as arms and technical gear thrust out into a close-up. Oooh! Scary!! This film really does have a decent cast, though. Tony Roberts as the reporter is a talented actor, but maybe just lacks the physical screen presence to be a true star. Ben Stiller has smaller ears! Lori Laughlin and a young Meg Ryan are both competent and pretty. Candy Clark is like a poor woman's JoBeth Williams. Tess Harper has done better work than this. The conclusion will leave you dis-satisfied to say the least. Its one of those endings where it just looks like they ran out of both time and money. Overall, the whole thing certainly should have been the final nail in the coffin of this franchise.

It does commit a heinous crime though by not taking the opportunity to kill Ryan in some gruesome fashion. This movie is one of a handful shot in 3D with Arriflex cameras, and features optical effects by Gary Platek, who also worked on the similar but far superior Poltergeist.

The team of ghost investigators sets up shop in the house and all hell breaks loose. Broken glass, furniture and even a stuffed swordfish fly at the viewer in a 3-D tour-de-force that must have been jaw-dropping in the movies.

What kind of a sick film is this?! This film even came up with the idea How to put the camera crew in the picture, without making them a goof (Crew or equipment visible) Ghost-searcher team. Genius (ironic) The best part was when they blew up that f***** house way up. Oh man, that was beautiful, because it meant the end and finally it was over. No catharsis, no nothing. I was just happy it ended. Too bad that they didn't need the house the make more of these Amityville films...If you see this film on air or in a video rental, don't watch it or spend any money on it. What you would get is hours of boring dialogs, bad acting, non-scary monsters, uninteresting plot, calculable scenes and terrible script.10/1 Doesn't deserves more. I wasn't afraid once.The best thing you could do with this film is gather your friends around, have some snacks, then mute down the film and make the synch yourself, dubbing the original.

As he settles in, his daughter Susan (Lori Loughlin) arrives to help him out. He and his assistant, Melanie, (Candy Clark) start an investigation, and it starts to turn up real strange incidents. As more evidence mounts that it really is haunted, a series of supernatural occurrences freak out the family. When a death sends them all over the edge and is blamed on the forces inside, John seeks the advice of his friend Elliot West, (Robert Joy) to help solve the puzzle of the house.The Good News There's a couple of good things about this one. As is usual with the Amityville films, the house is really sinister and spooky-looking, and its huge attic windows that glare out light eyes, and its huge, imposing figure taking up a large amount of the screen. That is a fundamental part of the success of the series, and the house allows for some great jump moments as well. A great gag with a flying door works perfectly, as does a delayed reaction to a car accident. Surprisingly, some suspenseful scenes work their way in as well. Two deserve special mention the steamy bath-tub and a special photograph both send shivers down the spine. In addition, the flies make a very welcome return in one of the film's best scenes. The build-up before it is a great suspense-builder, with the noises heard off-screen and the history of the house adding to the suspense in the moment. I hate to admit it, but several of the 3-D gags in here are quite good. A flying swordfish is one of the better ones, and a couple instances of a floating orb is pretty nice, as well. Those are the better ones, though, so expect a couple others that are pretty striking. In response to the really slow beginning, the ending is pretty action-packed and full of some great moments. Mixing in some not-so-traditional ideas was greatly unexpected and fun to watch. A touch of violence, and it makes for a great ending.The Bad News Well, some of the 3-D gags obviously look very corny and not at all scary. The titles in the opening credit sequence are a great example, as several of the flying objects later on do as well. Adding all the missed gags together creates a great cheesy atmosphere that many of it's denouncers like to cite against it. It took a while to get to anything, as there was a long wait for something to happen. Bits and pieces of the film work, but they are too far separated by other scenes that take a while to get the film going. Lastly, why would spirits be able to interfere with goings-on miles away? Doesn't really make any sense for them to be doing so.The Final Verdict It's not as bad as some say, but there are reasons for their cause. The gags are in between, with about half of them being effective or not. It's got an undeniable cheese factor to it, so only a fan of those kinds of movies or of the Amityville series will want to check this out. All others should exercise caution.Rated PG Violence "},{"Title":"Not Scary, but Fun","Date":"1 April 2006","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Okay - Amityville 3-D will not go down as one of the scariest films of all time.

Even the new 5.1 DD surround mix is very decent.The disc also have a running commentary track with experts Kim Newman and Stephen Jones. Also included in the set are an informative booklet telling everything you want to know about the movie and how the 3-D effect was created, plus five lobby cards and two pair of 3-D glasses. All packed together in a nice looking slipcase reproducing the original 1983 cinema poster artwork. The discs are housed in a thick robust Amaray double case.This is easily the best this movie has ever looked on any home format since its original theatrical showing back in 1983.

One of these fraudulent psychic mediums just happens to conduct their scamming business inside the infamous Amityville household. He then buys the house dirt cheap after it has been lying dormant for so many years due to poor publicity & the horrible happenings that occurred in that house a few years before. After moving in, he initially scoffs at the existence of supernatural going on's that occurred there, but finds himself surrounded by some pretty weird going on's, flies are manifesting by the dozens in the attic, faucets turn on all by themselves, footsteps can be heard when there is no one else in the house, windows & mirrors freeze up, the place is almost unbearably cold at times & anyone who has come into contact with the house or tries to warn him of the dangers he is in, meets a terrifying end.AMITYVILLE 3-D THE DEMON is a watchable but sadly not as interesting instalment in the AMITYVILLE series. What should be noted is how the film is the only PG rated entry in the entire series, unfortunately that also happens to be the films down fall, due to it's rating, the film is obviously hamstrung from going to far in terms of the scares & murder sequences. Weather this was intentionally done by the film-makers in order to try & put more butts in the seats or just by accident is not know, but regardless of this, the film is nowhere near as atmospheric, suspenseful, dark, bloody or weird as it's predecessor & lacks that eerie sense of dread of the original. AMITYVILLE 3-D does however boast some unique members amongst it's cast, in particular future FULL HOUSE star LORI LOUGHLIN & A-list actress MEG RYAN & the direction by SOYLENT GREEN director RICHARD FLEISCHER is pretty decent, as he manages to come up with a few interesting shots & the film at the very least mentions the DeFeo murders (In the sequel the DeFeo's were called the Montelli's & were missing one kid, since the DeFeo's were a family of seven & the Montelli's were a family of six) & the score by HOWARD BLAKE is just weird enough to tickle any horror fans liking, but the characters are nowhere near as interesting, Fleischer does indeed come up with some pretty good 3-D effects, such as a fly buzzing around, a floating Frisbee, a charred corpse, a floating orb & a tree branch which are the main focus of the 3-D effects. Unfortunately that appears to be the only thing both he & the production crew were really focused on, since everything else including weirdness, jump scares, suspense & tension were sadly ignored. While AMITYVILLE 3-D has some weird moments, they are not executed all that well & lack in the chills department. There's a pretty good demon monster suit that pops up briefly at the end, as well as some grisly ghost make-up seen during a nightmare sequence, but most of these scare sequences are poorly staged & can be spotted a mile away. I also frowned upon the idea that the supernatural presence would make itself known to a ton of people inside the house, who have cameras & microphones set up all over the place, in the previous two films the evil only made itself known to those living in the house, here it just shows up & doesn't seem to mind the fact that there are tons of people present recording it.Known in some area's as AMITYVILLE THE RETURN. In fact if one pays close attention, the name AMITYVILLE is the name of a real town & is therefore in the public domain, meaning that any film company could just latch their waggons onto the title & just make their own Amityville movie, which unfortunately was done a few years after the release of the first movie, as the film- makers & studio's omitted the word HORROR out of the title & just kept the name Amityville, why? because if they were to just call their films THE AMITYVILLE HORROR PART whatever, they would have to pay both JAY ANSON the original books author & the Lutz family tons of money, just to use the title.All in all, while I enjoyed watching AMITYVILLE 3-D, I will say that I was not as engrossed in the story or characters like I was in the first two movies, there was just to many missed opportunities that could have been taken advantage of here & at times the film is a tad sluggish & dull. Regardless of it's many short comings I still recommend this to fans of the series, but if you didn't like the first two than don't bother with this one. It looks at the climax that the infamous house of evil has been defeated for good, since it is destroyed right down to the ground, but such was not to be, as six years later it was followed by a made for TV movie called AMITYVILLE 4 THE EVIL ESCAPES*** stars "}{"Title":"Revenge of the 80's Where's the 3-D?","Date":"5 March 2004","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Amityville 3 (1983) since I saw it on home video I was robbed of experiencing the movie in 3-D.

I've also seen Part II, and The Amityville Curse (1990) (V), which should be part five if its release date is correct. However, the numbering of the titles skipped over Curse, and made Amityville 1992 It's About Time (1992) (V) part five.

The only similar disclaimer I can think of is for Witchtrap (1989), which insists it is not a sequel to Witchboard (1986). OK. But 3-D does make reference to the events of (as I recall) the prologue of the first Amityville movie - the DeFeo murders. And it's followed by Amityville IV The Evil Escapes. It's also in a 1980s tradition of making the third installment of a series 3-D, like Friday the 13th Part 3 3D (1982) and Jaws 3-D (1983).An investigator exposes a phony medium during a s√©ance (phony medium=redundant) in the Amityville house for a publication he works for. The real estate agent offers him a very low price on the house, since he can't sell it. Seemingly, it is also a bribe, since the real estate agent may have had ties to the medium and doesn't want any bad publicity. The agent almost falls into a well in the basement, said to be a pit into hell, but dies inside the house soon after of other causes. Photos the investigator's partner took of the s√©ance appear to show a ghostly figure of the agent, who had not been there.The haunted house also proves it can extend its power beyond its walls when it appears to be responsible for an elevator malfunction and a car crash.Not much happens in the movie, and it's not very interesting, and has nothing to recommend it that I can think of - perhaps it was slightly better in its proper aspect ratio and in 3-D.

In this one, a journalist played by Tony Roberts buys the house. The minute he does, people around him start dying in mysterious ways. This was the first Amityville to trail away from the true stories of the Lutz and DeFeo families. This here is all fiction. Of course, many could argue that parts one and two were fiction as well. I actually enjoyed Amityville 3-D a bit more than part II.The acting in this is pretty bad all around. Meg Ryan debuts, but only has a few lines. Nothing much. The demon in the house looked sort of good (for a 1983 film), but we don't see it until the end. I have to say I would have liked to see it in 3-D years ago. 3-D was the big thing in the early eighties. Jaws and Friday the 13th both used that format around this time.The 3-D objects include 3-D flies, 3-D swordfish, even 3-D spit. The film moves at a very slow pace and I lost interest in it quickly.

The second Amityville picture gave us its rendition of what happened...sort of...with the Defeo family prior to the Lutzes moving in and then out 28 days later. Presumably this trash takes place after both of those incidents. You know you are in trouble when Tony Roberts is your main gate attraction. Trouble indeed comes, but first a brief look at the plot writer for a cheap magazine called Reveal buys house cheap and things happen to people he knows. people start dropping like flies...for those that sat through that..get it. Yeah, I need some levity no matter how small the dose because I sat through a real bad picture. The story has no hold on you at all as things in the house just start to happen. First character actor John Harkins gets flies all over his face and dies belly-up(for him no small feat). Tony Roberts gets in a weird elevator miles from the house. Candy Clark, his friend and photographer, stays waiting in the house for Tony. A fuse is blown and she gets air blown all over her from the basement door. Tony gets home and she screams not to be touched in a truly funny(though not intentionally) moment. Clark later is burned to a crisp in a car. Meg Ryan and Lori Loughlin, both hot, look the house over when Lori's dad Tony is out. Meg talks about ghosts having sex. Yawn. Tony'ex and Lori's mom forbids Lori to go to the house. She does...and, well, things get even more bizarre, stupid, and wretched again. This movie has no real story. The special effects are constructed in such a way that every shot, whether it be a fly buzzing in an elevator, should look 3-d. Roberts as the lead had me laughing as he has virtually no acting range whatsoever. After a couple deaths he looks exactly the same. Like he just got through trading witty barbs(though none witty here) with Woody Allen. Check out the special effects at the end of the film from the water well. Phew! Who came up with that junk? This movie is poorly scripted, poorly directed, and poorly acted. It makes the second Amityville almost look artistic. A truly bad movie all around.

But this time, its murderous days might be numbered.After an enjoyable sequel in Amityville II The Possession, which was essentially a rehash of the original but well-executed, writer William Wales is all too aware that a third trip to the well will need to offer up something different before the onset of serious deja vu. He succeeds in his attempt, but not before the equally formidable onset of serious apathy.Events have moved on since Sonny Montelli brutally murdered his family in 'The Possession'. By now, everyone in Amityville knows the house's reputation and not even a lease no more expensive than a couple of food stamps can convince anyone to move in. So brings the big sea change from the 'innocence' of the earlier episodes - with no unsuspecting family slowly discovering their new home sits atop a gateway to hell, instead, the lead characters *choose* to visit the house precisely because it's haunted as a challenge to their professional scepticism. Soon, they become drawn into events even they can't explain.Amityville III isn't the only horror sequel to take this route. When you've taken the unexplained as far as you can before repetition sets in, the only alternative seems to be to bring in the pseudoscience and the university postgraduate ghostbusters, immediately puncturing half of the atmosphere. 'Poltergeist III' began this descent, and the problem in both cases is we already *know* the explanation is a supernatural one, so unless the determined sceptic is well-acted and satisfyingly dispatched by the very thing he refuses to believe in like Dr. Seaton was with Reverend Kane, it's not very entertaining. This, I have to say, isn't the only 'Poltergeist' parallel the spectral loss of the main character's daughter, his efforts to get her back, the demon of the title and the film's climax all evoke Steven Spielberg's superior first entry in his trilogy - also produced in 1983.But Wales is aware that Amityville can't cruise down Exorcist Street a third time and so everyone who dies here is fully compos mentis. In fact, they don't even have to be in the house anymore. All it apparently takes now is for them to have visited the house at some point, and the building can then exert its malign influence no matter how far away they are. It's not an unreasonable approach, but the whole point of Amityville *was* about being possessed once you crossed the threshold. If you can die anywhere, how it is it then different from say, 'The Omen'? Still, it does allow for at least one fairly good death scene in a car - one of two in this film, the other involving an 'unexpected' ghost. The lack overall of decent death scenes is another of the film's weaknesses. Seriously, when it's time to bring out the killer bees, you either unveil Tony Todd and his leather jacket or you go back to the drawing board.I can't really say the principal cast stood out for me a great deal. Tony Roberts, the film's lead and its chief sceptic, spends a lot of time engaged in 'furrowed brow' acting while Tess Harper as his estranged wife plays a fairly sympathetic character whose concerns are justified, but she just comes across as annoying. Robert Joy looks as though he hasn't slept in a week (is it just the lighting?), but Candy Clark is a welcome presence, able to convey terror very convincingly and a highlight in one of the film's better death scenes. Annoyingly, Meg Ryan's character, who seemed to be around only to remind viewers of 'The Possession's storyline, survives to the end of the film.The film's atmosphere is bolstered not necessarily in a good way by some rather retro-sounding musical cues by Howard Blake (who recently walked in the air with the success of animated feature 'The Snowman'), sounding at times almost like 60s adventure - back when Richard Fleischer directed decent films like 'Fantastic Voyage', while at other times slipstreaming back to the modern sounds of 1983. It would also be remiss not to mention that this is the only Amityville to join the slew of films of the period that were propped up by 3D - presumably to hide the lack of a decent script. Thank god we don't see that kind of silliness these days. The sequences shot for the purpose are glaringly obvious, but then again, sections of the plot were clearly built around them, the aforementioned bee extravaganza being the key offender. I'm sure it was fun at the time.So three movies in and my favourite is still the second. The third really doesn't offer much by comparison by way of memorable characters, scare factor or death sequences, but it has a few key moments and just ticks over enough to hold off serious boredom. It really stands out for what it is - the idea-starved final in a film series that didn't have enough creative input to sustain it. It's either not at all surprising it took 6 years for a 4th effort, or surprising that someone actually went to trouble - can't decide which.

Review Well in a time when 3-d films were the hot thing to do (Jaws 3-d, Parasite) some one decided that another sequel to the Amytiville series would be a good idea. Boy were they wrong.One of the main annoyances of this film is that since it was made for you to enjoy with your 3-d glasses on and not in the comfort of your own home, the 3-d effects just seem very silly on a regular screen, things get thrown into the screen for no reason at all. You'll find your self wondering why the hell are they showing that finger for so long? Then you realize oh, yeah, this is supposed to be 3-d. Not only that but that type of thing just takes you out of the story, and really makes you feel like, oh yes, this is a movie. It doesn't really let you get into the story. So anyhow, that's just one of the things that went wrong with this one. Let me get going here cause I got a long list of complaints.First of the film does open up with a nice spooky s√©ance, with some nice atmosphere, the wind blowing, a dimly lit house, ghostly sounds and lit candles. But unfortunately thats as spooky or scary as this movie gets, it fails to live up to its atmospheric opening sequence.A pair of reporters doing an article on haunted houses find that in the now infamous Amityville home a pair of con-artists have been taking advantage of people, making them believe that they can contact spirits inside the home. Well, the reporters blow the lid on their scam and the elderly couple are kicked out of the house.Enter John Baxter (played by Tony Roberts) an incurable skeptic who doesn't believe in ghosts or the supernatural, therefore he decides to buy the house in spite of the houses bloody and supernatural history. That's were the trouble begins for poor old Mr. Baxter.Unfortunately for us the film never really goes anywhere, nothing really important happens for the longest time and we the poor viewers have to endure this torture of a film.As weird deaths start to happen (wouldn't you know it?) again in the house, Jhon Baxter, the skeptic, ignores it all. He figures that there's always a rational explanation for everything. Even when his reporter friend is going crazy after she's been attacked by the demon. As is common in these types of characters, the skeptic will wait till its waaaay to late to actually accept that yes maybe there is something weird going on. For some reason, just like in Poltergeist III, the evil turns things cold. Why didn't that happen in the other films? Who knows? Maybe the evil likes the cold this time around, I don't know.Most of the film is spent just debating if we should believe in the supernatural or not. Its nothing like the first two films which were actually entertaining and had that supernatural element always present.They also present us with Elliot West (played by Robert Joy) a paranormal investigator, who has got to be Egon Spenglers long lost brother. They decide to move in the house to see if there truly is some psychic phenomena going on. When the phenomena finally does manifest itself, it's in the form of some truly crappy and laughable special effects. I mean come on! One of the visual effects looks like a piece of cloth being thrown in the air. Only thing is that its purple and in slow motion. Huh? Is this what passed as good visual effects in 83? It has a very unsatisfying ending, did they beat the demon? Did they destroy it? Who knows, because that my friends, is never resolved. Unlike The Possession this ending will leave you wondering why you just waisted two hours of your life watching this wretched piece of film.Not even Meg Ryan's, who has a small role in this film can save it. She plays a rebellious and adventurous girl who likes to experiment with the supernatural, she really digs the fact that a lot of horrible deaths occurred in the house and decides to do her own little Ouija board session with her friends. So when a Ouija board tells here some one is going to die, they do the next logical thing....go on a boat ride! Dumb! Anyhows if you want to subject yourself to a really bad film, I suggest you check this out. If not then save yourself from the true evil, having to watch this film!

There has never ever been a well directed 3-D movie and there never will be . In a normal film in general and a horror film in general much of the background is utilised . With a 3-D movie the opposite is put into force where much of the action takes place in the foreground One good example of the above is the man who goes into a room and is attacked by flies . Let's forgot that a very similar scene happened in the first movie which proves how uninspiring this screenplay is and just look at the problem of filming in 3-D . The camera lingers far too long on a swarm of flies as the audience are overwhelmed by the 3-D gimmick then a bloody great fly zooms out of the screen . There's far too many over long unedited scenes like this when objects fly outwards from the screen . I've no idea what an audience watching this in a cinema with their silly glasses on think of this directing technique but watching this at home on two dimensional television you can't help noticing how artificial and irritating these directorial blunders are . Perhaps the saddest thing is knowing director Richard Fleischer directed such classics as NARROW MARGIN , 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA and FANTASTIC VOYAGE . It's obscene that someone this talented could end up working on something so poor . Will we sometime in the future see Peter Jackson direct a sequel to THE AMITYVILLE HORROR remake ? I sincerely hope not , but that's how far Fleischer has sadly fallen The script too suffers from being written around 3-D set pieces rather than being written in a logical and natural manner . There is one aspect at the start that has great potential and that is that the hero John Baxter is an investigative journalist who doesn't believe in the supernatural . One can't help thinking the story should have taken a turning where Baxter should have proved beyond any doubt that the events of the original movie were nothing more than an elaborate hoax where the Lutz family made a lot of money out of a media driven scam .

John and Melanie's plan of entrapment works and they get their story. The next day John and Melanie go back to the house to take some more photographs for the story. The house's current owner Clifford Sanders (John Harkins) turns up and denies any knowledge of what the Caswell's, the previous tenants were doing. Sanders tells John that he cannot sell the property because of the rumours and stigma attached to it. As John is currently going through a messy divorce with his wife Nancy (Tess Harper) he becomes interested in the property and agrees to buy it when he learns Sanders is, and I quote practically giving it away. Despite Sanders suddenly dropping dead for no real reason John moves in. At first everything seems fine, both he and daughter, Susan (Lori Loughlin) are pleased with the purchase. Things don't stay that way for long, however. Strange things start to happen, doors shut and lock by themselves, lights suddenly switch off for no apparent reason and two tragic 'accidents' happen that take the life of two people who recently had been in the house. John decides to enlist the help of his friend Dr. Elliot West (Robert Joy) who works for the institute of psychic research at the State University, Long Island. West and his team of assistants set lots of scientific equipment up in the house and wait. Eventually they find what they've been searching for, potentially with tragic and explosive consequences!Directed by Richard Fleischer I don't really have anything good to say about this film. The script by David Ambrose and William Wales is about as slow and dull as you could possibly imagine, and every single haunted house clich√© is in here somewhere, I mean lights switching themselves on and off? Doors closing on their own? A tap running on it's own? Various 'spooky' noises that turn out to be nothing more than people walking around on creaking floorboards? One character having a very bad feeling about the place but no one else believing them? A innocent s√©ance that turns nasty? Got the general idea yet? The film plods along at a extremely sedate pace until I was almost woken up by a car crash and someone being burned alive inside the wreck, but this sequence only lasts for a couple of minutes and in no way compensates for what has gone before or indeed after. There is a silly rubber monster at the end which is on screen for about half a minute, thanks a lot Fleischer. There is no blood or gore in it, again thanks for nothing Fleischer. There are a couple of unintentionally funny scenes though. At one point Baxter is in a lift that goes out of control. The G-Force on the way up pins him to the floor and on the way back down it pins him to the roof! A very stupid looking scene. As is the one where Sanders is attacked by flies, flies are just not scary or dangerous and all they do is just sort of land on him as Harkins tries to act like he's terrified and that's it, funny stuff. This film was originally shot in 3-D, there are a few scenes here and there which are obviously meant to incorporate this process and stick out like a sore thumb like the pipe through the car window, various things being supernaturally thrown towards the camera and the opening credits which look awful when played flat on an ordinary T.V. screen. It's certainly well made and the acting is OK, look out for Meg Ryan who has a small role as Lisa, one of Susan's friends. Boring, far too long, dull and there isn't a single original idea in the whole thing. I suggest you look elsewhere for some haunted house thrills and chills!

And although I can't really say I was so impressed with it that I instantly wish to watch all the other ones, I thought it was a reasonably well-made thriller with okay effects, good acting and a solid directing job by Richard Fleischer. This was one of the last films by the famous filmmaker who previously brought us modest classics like Soylent Green ,2000 Leagues under the Sea and 10 Rillington Place. The story of Amityville 3-D begins with a surprisingly ingenious sequence in which 2 undercover journalists unmask a couple of frauds that abused the supernatural past of the Amityville house for profitable goals. The skeptic reporter John Baxter then buys the house for a ridiculously cheap price, ignoring all the warnings of his superstitious friends and colleagues. Only after a long series of unfortunate events, he acknowledges that the house has a will of its own and that the well in his basement might just be a gateway to hell itself. The screenplay is nowhere near spectacular and most of the horrific events already featured in previous and similar films (a terminal insect-attack, high-speed elevator rides, demonic winds, ouija board games &#133;). But, it has to be said, it's all atmospherically presented, with an eye for flair and even some tension. The 3-D effects look quite silly when watching this film on an ordinary TV screen (and without the funky goggles) but some of the imaginative camera-work remains saved. The script turns into a complete utter mess near the climax and the abrupt ending almost ruins the film completely. This is not what you'd call an absolute must-see, but it's entertaining 80's trash nevertheless.On a lesser important note men who were forced to endure all those dreadful romantic comedies starring Meg Ryan should definitely suggest watching THIS flick for a change. It's probably the only change you'll ever have to see her star in a film alongside other demons. "},{"Title":"Mostly, I just laughed and laughed... and well... laughed... get it? Three times?","Date":"14 November 2006","Score":"0 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Well, I'm done with the third installment of the Amityville Horror sequels, and may I ask, what's with the 3-D sequels? Is it supposed to add more scare? Well, I guess it just doesn't work as well when you're at home without the glasses and a 16 inch TV. The third installment isn't a bad one, but it's not my cup of tea right now. Although, it was interesting seeing Meg Ryan's first mistakes.Well, a new idiotic family has bought the house, two journalists and their daughter. But of course, strange things are happening in the house, like horrible deaths, moving objects, you know the standards of the haunted house. The mother goes as far as to move out and forbid her daughter from entering, but due to Meg's hypnotizing lips, her and her friends decide to have some fun turning into a typical tragedy, and you can decide for yourself what you've heard before.Well, it's an OK flick, but it's not that good, believe me. So far, I'd rather stick with the second one when it comes to the sequels, but I'm onto the Dollhouse. I'm not sure what to expect, but I hope I get something good out of this series. But judging by the ratings, frankly, I'm afraid... very afraid.3/10-get it? three? ehhh...

This new story has an investigative reporter (Tony Roberts) and his assistant (Candy Clark) busting a couple con artists working inside the Amityville house. After the bust the reporter decides to buy the house since he is separating from his wife (Tess Harper) and sure enough strange events begin to happen. I think the biggest question one must ask when it comes to AMITYVILLE 3 is why on Earth anyone would purchase the house to begin with. Not too long ago I read a pretty good interview with director Fleischer where he went into great detail about the production history of this film and reading his comments made it appear that the film never had a chance. From the pre-filming lawsuits to the various issues while filming, this movie seemed doomed to fail and it pretty much put the nail in the coffin of the franchise before it eventually got started again thanks to TV and DTV movies. The biggest problem with this third movie is that there doesn't seem to be a reason for it being made. I'm also not quite sure who they were making this film for either. The movie was rated PG and it's clear that 1983 was a time for slashers so you pretty much alienated the majority of the horror crowd by going with a clear movie. There are a couple death scenes but they are done without much use of special effects and none of them are overly thrilling. The haunted aspects of the story also come across quite bland and they're certainly never scary. The film was originally shot in 3-D but I could only few the 2-D version and it was rather strange to see that there's really not too much stuff flying straight at the camera. The opening credits obviously do and there are a few other moments but for the most part the film is perfectly viewable flat. In that previously mentioned interview, Fleischer also makes it clear that the majority of the people working on the film had no idea how to properly use 3-D. Roberts is an actor I always enjoy watching and while this material certainly isn't his Woody Allen glory days, I still enjoyed seeing him here. Harper seems incredibly bored with her part and I guess you can't really blame her. Clark has a pretty big role here but her acting leaves a little to be desired. The film is probably best remembered for featuring a young Meg Ryan who gets to show off that memorable laugh. There are certainly much worse movies out there but there are very few where you watch them and ask yourself what the entire point was. I'm sure money was the main goal but the producers didn't get that and the viewer didn't get any sort of entertainment. "}]
