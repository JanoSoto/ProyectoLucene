[{"Title":"An Outstanding Film About Friendship and Adversity","Date":"9 September 1999","Score":"38 out of 41 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, War","Review":"  A friend of mine has been after me to watch Birdy for several months now.  Yesterday we finally had a chance and much to my delight, I found the film to be everything she said it was and more.Birdy, directed by Alan Parker, is a story of friendship between Al (Nicholas Cage) and Birdy (Matthew Modine), two Philadelphia, Pa high schoolers who end up being sent to Vietnam.  It is the early 1960's and Al could very easily be the street hood, but we can see he has a heart.  He is tough (and will not back down from a fight) but plays ball with the neighborhood kids in the field which ajoins Birdy's house.  Everytime a home run is hit, the ball flies over the fence and is scooped up by Birdy's mother, never to be seen again.  Birdy's mother is uncompromising with his father and the neighborhood kids, a source of embarrassment and guilt which burdens Birdy, causing him to feel like an outsider.  He is interested in birds and flight, which becomes a metaphor for Birdy's developing obsession with the idea of flying away from his increasingly unbearable family situation.As a result of a misunderstanding regarding a stolen knife, Al warms to Birdy and sees there is more to this clumsy kid than meets the eye.  Al is experiencing his own troubles with his father but deals with the situation in a different way than Birdy.  The birds begin to fascinate Al and the two develop a close friendship which strengthens in troubled times and blooms in good times.In Vietnam, Birdy finally faces a situation which he can't physically fly away from, which is a hundred times more horrible than his home life.  And Al, although also in Vietnam, is not with him for support.  Here is where Birdy's final breakdown occurs and it's up to Al, who now is dealing with his own physical scars, to bring Birdy back.Alan Parker directed this film (from the novel Birdy by William Whorton, who also wrote the source novel for A Midnight Clear) with a flashback narrative which works beautifully.  Al and Birdy's friendship is fully developed and realistic.  Both characters have depth and are engaging.  Never has Nicholas Cage done as fine a work as his role as Al (his performance in Guarding Tess was close).  His performance as Al made me wish he would choose more roles like this instead of Face/Off and Con Air.  Matthew Modine is excellent as Birdy.  We can feel the emotional pain of a youth who didn't ask for any of this but uses his inner strength of character to stave off mental defeat.Thankfully, the Vietnam sequences, although very well done, are short and few.  This is not a film about Vietnam but a film about Al and Birdy.  Birdy went to Vietnam with a pre-existing problem.  Vietnam made it worse.  There is some commentary concerning the military and the VA but it does not criticize.  Although not always on the right track, the Army Major who brings Al (a wounded sergeant by this time) from Fort Dix to the VA psychiatric hospital to speak with Birdy made the right choice.Birdy is one of those films which haunts the mind. I'm sure other elements and ideas from the film will become more apparent to me long after this writing.  This is an outstanding character study which has been overlooked for too long.

It's about the developing friendship between Al (Nick Cage) and Birdy (Matthew Modine), but it's also about a descent into madness, and the lengths to which Al goes for his friend.The film starts in the late 60's, in a US military mental hospital. Cage has been seriously wounded, and has had reconstructive surgery on his face, but he's been brought in because Birdy is here. He's uncommunicative and appears to recognise no one, spending all day squatting on the floor of his cell squinting up at the window.The story is mostly told in flashbacks, either Al recounting incidents in their growing friendship as neighbourhood kids or, later, Birdy remembering other incidents. From the start the two are pretty dissimilar - Al is athletic, outgoing and popular while Birdy is quiet and introverted - a typical nerd. The two are, paradoxically, brought together by Birdy's love of birds, and the stupid things they do - making suits out of pigeon feathers to befriend more pigeons, climbing on (and falling off) factories trying to capture more birds.Al tries to set Birdy on a 'normal' track; they buy a wrecked car and fix it up, and head off to the beach. But Birdy is just too wrapped up in himself for this to work, and it's a wonder he doesn't alienate Al with his strange behaviour.In the 'present', the doctor is putting more pressure on Al to get Birdy to respond; if he doesn't, then Birdy will be written off and sent to a permanent mental institution. The flashbacks continue, and it becomes clear that Birdy's love of birds has turned into an obsession, and then into the darker realms beyond that.The final few minutes of the film cover a lot of ground; Al finally realises that Birdy is pretty well off the deep end; they both go off to fight in the war; Al gets his injury, while we see the incident that left Birdy in his present state. Meanwhile the doctor finally decides that time has run out, but Al decides he's not leaving.The ending of the film is incredibly powerful, and it should be a criminal offence to give it away. Is it 'appropriate' to the rest of the film? I dunno - but I thought it was pretty damn good.The film stands or falls on the performances of Cage and Modine - and, for me, it stands tall. Cage is excellent in his role, capturing the bravado of his character perfectly; but Modine is simply brilliant. During the flashbacks he portrays his nerdy character completely believably, but it's the way he handles the scenes in the asylum that amazed me. As soon as you know his obsession, it is crystal clear that he's not squatting in his cell, but perching, wishing to fly.Alan Parker has made some great films; this might just be his best.

Well, he spends most of his time with birds, has dreams of flying away from his real-world troubles, and his only friend is a neighborhood tough named Al (Nicolas Cage). So because of his obsession with birds, Birdy has to be crazy, right? So is Al even crazier for befriending him&#133; well, isn't he?It is these questions and many more that make up the central theme of Alan Parker's superb 1984 drama Birdy (adapted from William Wharton's novel), a film about two crazy guys whose friendship is ultimately tested by each other's mental sicknesses. Both of their lives take drastic turns before and after they have done tours in Vietnam, and ultimately wind up in opposite ends of the psyche ward of a state mental hospital, with Al, who's been left virtually unrecognizable by his facial bandages and Birdy, who's stuck in a catatonic state as a result of an accident out on the killing fields.It is also the feelings of isolation between the two that brings them together, as flashbacks during their stay help to emphasize their emotions. Birdy, feeling like he is the only one that understands his bird dream, may in actuality be the only sane character in the whole film. Al, who is injured from a shell explosion, questions who he is because he's not even sure who it really is underneath the bandages on his face. And it is liberation, whether it be physical or mental, that is expressed greatly by the film's ending, and Birdy's eventual coming to grips with his own current predicament.Director Parker has always made it a point of capturing human suffering on celluloid, and this has been the main subject in a number of his films, including Midnight Express (1978) and Angel Heart (1987). Here, his subject matter is fairly lighter than those films, since the audience is spared the really intense mental anguish that accompanied Express and the graphic carnage of Angel.There's a kind of deep spiritual undercurrent flowing through Birdy, which is most apparent by the lead character's fascination with his quarry &#150; birds. To him, birds represent freedom, a kind of freedom that can only be obtained by literally taking to the skies, and soaring high above all his problems (fans of Terry Gilliam's political satire Brazil should take notice here). This of course leads to the film's profound ending on the mental hospital's rooftop, where Al and Birdy must make a desperate choice &#150; choose freedom, or choose confinement &#150; of the body, or of the psyche.I won't reveal any more than those close details but you'll have to see what happens for yourself. It really caught me off guard and in a lesser movie might seem tacky, but the way Parker and the actors handle just makes the on-screen action that much more moving. But you can be sure of this Birdy flies. And Birdy does fly into underrated classic movie status because of its performers and director Alan Parker's direction.10/10 "},{"Title":"Flying Away From Society (a kind of long synopsis of Birdy's themes)","Date":"9 July 2001","Score":"17 out of 19 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, War","Review":"  Note this is best read *after* having seen Birdy, as it contains some general spoilers.`As scary as a bird's life may be, they always have that.  They can fly away.'-Birdy.To say that Birdy is a film about a young man obsessed with birds and flying is to oversimplify a great deal.  Birdy is an extraordinary film that deals with the longing to fly, and everything that such a yearning entails about a person.  It's about people who weren't meant to live in this world, this society, who don't belong, who don't fit in and don't really want to fit in.  It's about the overwhelming frustration of not having asked for any of `this', yet constantly being reminded that no matter how much one doesn't want to be a part of it all, just by being human there is no escape; the world will not let you do as you want, and one cannot fly away. In director Alan Parker's vision, these feelings that are so hard to put into words are articulately and beautifully expressed.I'm not going to focus on plot details as much as on what Birdy is `about', but I will just say that Matthew Modine gives an incredible performance as Birdy.  At moments his greatest power simply comes from his eyes and facial expressions (especially in his scenes in the military asylum).  This is a perfect example of superb casting and an actor just disappearing into his role. Obviously the character of Birdy is central to understanding the film, and his fascination with birds and particularly their flight is his way of trying to deal with a cold, insensitive world while being a sensitive individual.  His growing obsession with his birds and disassociation with the outside world comes with his realization that he is alone and no one understands him, even Al (Nicholas Cage), his best and only friend.Birdy doesn't care about the outside world, and his ideas of what is truly important and what freedom is couldn't be further from the society that tells him to be concerned with superficial things. He is pure to the highest extent in that he is not in the least tainted by the constant pressure the world places on him to fit in and be `normal'.  Al connects him to the outside world, and allows him to share some of his dreams to a certain degree, but Birdy more or less continues to live in his own little world.  And even though Birdy isn't disturbing anyone, it seems that just the little things that mean so much to him are what are constantly threatened to be taken away.  His own mom always threatens to get rid of his birds, and uses this to force Birdy to go to the prom, which he has no interest in. This serves as an example of a relatively trivial matter that is looked upon as some major event in every young person's life.  Here Birdy is  more or less being told 'fit in, or I'll take away the one thing that you have that truly matters to you'.  Similarly, all of Birdy and Al's chances of fun and freedom are taken away throughout the film--their car for example, the closest thing they have to being able to get up and take off. And they get into trouble when they haven't really done anything too bad, showing the ways the uptight, unreasonable society tries to force everyone into line.  How it sucks the life out of people is also shown, especially through adult characters like Birdy and Al's parents. While it's true that Birdy's parents just want better for him, they could never understand what would be better for him.  This idea of losing any sort of idealism and settling down is shown in Birdy and Al's father's jobs.  Birdy's dad is a janitor at his school and Al's is a garbage man.  I think I can honestly make a judgement that no one grows up dreaming of or even expecting to become one of the above jobs.  But time and time again the world crushes ideals and hopes and dreams and forces everyone into some kind of role.Birdy and Al's going off to Vietnam is not only the ultimate example of being forced to do something one doesn't want--- of no escape and no choice--- but also shows the irony of war for people like Birdy, who doesn't want anything to do with this world anyway, and the anti-authoritarian Al. Supposedly they are fighting for freedom; yet is this really freedom for people who never even wanted to be part of this society in the first place? Freedom for the very society that crushes their souls and determines how they will live, to continue to exist? The film is brought to its climatic height in the scene that shows what sent Birdy over the edge.  As bombs explode and men die around him there is nothing he can do but sit and watch as all sorts of species of birds fly away from the horror.  Birdy is sent over the edge with this realization that he *can't* fly like a bird, he is not free and will never truly be on this earth, as a human being.Finally, I guess at this point it's practically mandatory to comment on the much-debated ending.  I personally like it and happen to think its one of the funniest moments in film I've ever seen. But besides, it also fits into the context of the film.  Here we have a whimsical film about quirky people doing quirky things.  So why should a quirky ending suddenly be considered a cheap gag? Sure it's abrupt, but the entire film has been unconventional and has also had its share of  humorous moments. Furthermore, I've noticed a great deal of symmetry throughout Birdy, especially with the `jump/fly' scenes; where every time Birdy gets himself in trouble and it looks as though he's about to fall to his death, and Al gets all worried,  Birdy manages to be okay and land on his feet (sort of). If you watch closely, and also listen (to the music which seems  to signify these scenes) a lot more than you may have expected  will fall into place. I also just want to quickly mention how beautifully and poetically shot some of the scenes are (a great moment is when we fly from a bird's point of view).  Obviously,  a lot more can be said and be gotten out of Birdy, and I didn't use many specific examples because there are just too many to choose from, but here I just tried to best sum up what strikes me the most about this film.  Anyone who's ever felt absolutely out of place in this world and frustrated with being stuck on the ground here will almost certainly be able to make a connection with this film.

It's such a great growing-up buddy flick. Despite the serious subject matter (shell-shocked, catatonic Vietnam vet in mental hospital), the movie manages to be very light-hearted for the most part, without discounting the gravity of the situation that the characters are in. It doesn't seek to use the war as a means of creating the identities of the characters, the war and the present situation in the film (most of the film is flashbacks) are more background to the story of two crazy Philly kids growing up together.The movie is full of laughs that don't occur at the expense of the characters, but rather, bring you closer to them. I personally identified with Matthew Modine's character, and found myself laughing in spite of myself at some of his mishaps and wondering how did I ever survive being a teenager?Modine plays Birdy flawlessly. His character, while strange, is certainly believable and definitely likeable. He's like the visionary mystic friend I never had! Nicholas Cage is equally good as Al, Birdy's more down-to-earth lady's man friend. Their friendship seems unlikely on the outside, but powerful and inevitable by the end of the movie.I think it's strange that some people didn't like the ending to Birdy. I think it's one of the best movie endings for a buddy film ever. It accurately reflects the tone of Birdy and Al's relationship more than any other ending possibly could. It ties their characters in the present in perfectly with the growing-up characters of the flashback sequences. Perfect!

This one, Birdy will surely rank among his best movies. He revives a myth, a desire that always shone in men flying but not with a plane or an helicopter, just like Icare with real wings. This is what haunts a teenager's mind whose name is Birdy. This one devotes all his free time by inventing stratagems or ways so as to be able to fly in the sky. he also has an interest in birds' social life with their habits (it's not a fate that his name is Birdy because there's the word bird in it). Even if he didn't win his best friend's adherence concerning these odd likings, they succeeded in striking up a strong relationship. Above all, birdy is this a story of a friendship between two teenagers brought up in a Philadelphia' popular area. They're sharing jobs, free time, girls before they were parted by the Vietnam war. Parker films this relationship with its joys, its sorrows in a hearty way and make the two actors friendly. Birdy is also a well-regulated movie where Parker knows how to sustain the interest in the past sequences as well as present sequences (Birdy's room hospital). Furthermore, there's not a sequence where one of the two main actors is stealing to the other, the spotlight. But the movie seems easy when it denounces the atrocities of war and its disastrous consequences on young people (Cage's long monologue with Modine in his arms towards the end of the movie). These sorrowful consequences are concrete (Cage's face full of bandages) and abstract (Modine has become dumb and stays immures in his silence). Nevertheless, emotion prevails in the end and you sympathize to the two teenagers' helpless after the war.

Those who perpetrate suffering not only to humans but animals alike can never have the empathy that defines us as human.

He and his friend Al are sent to fight in Vietnam but are shipped back with both physical and mental wounds. As Birdy withdraws into a silent catatonia, can Al bring him out of his dream world ?Based on a book by William Wharton, this tender character study of friendship, madness and the haunting effects of war is extremely well written and directed, and beautifully played by the two leads. How much you empathise with Birdy depends very much on your experiences I guess, but I find his devotion to learning to fly and his bewilderment at many of the ridiculous qualities of people very easy to identify with. He is a lunatic in the pure sense that as his obsession deepens the gulf between reality and his dreams doesn't matter to him, but he's a well-adjusted lunatic who understands other people but simply isn't interested in behaving like them. His concept that birds fly more through self-confidence and a respect for the properties of air (as opposed to more mundane issues like weight and velocity) is incredibly seductive and thought-provoking. The movie really makes you think about the damage society does to people, both on an everyday suburban level (Birdy's mother, Al's father) and a historical/global level (the horrors of combat). If it has a flaw it's that the lengthy scenes in the military sanitarium are grey, talky and inevitably one-sided, in sharp contrast to the vivid slice-of-life sections in Philly, all of which are full of humour and pathos (the dog-hunting sequence is particularly gleeful and horrible). Overall however it's extraordinarily beautiful - Michael Seresin's photography is haunting and absorbing, lingering over dark blue spaces and dirty backyards or soaring skyward as Birdy escapes into his fantasies. Equally powerful is Peter Gabriel's brooding, rich, esoteric sequencer music which (uniquely in film scoring history I think) was culled, reconceived and re-recorded from samples of songs from his previous two studio albums. The music lurks around every scene, mewling and pulsing like some animated force, providing a voice for Birdy's voiceless inner state. Cage and Modine are both excellent, with a fine support cast and a great troupe of animal actors who duly receive prominent credits - this must be the only film to employ a stunt canary. There were a slew of 'Nam films made in the mid-eighties (Hamburger Hill, Platoon, Gardens Of Stone) and whilst this fits that category it's about much more than just what's now referred to as post-traumatic stress disorder. It's about searching for an escape from everything, a point of view which brings extreme clarity and which no-one else can attain. A fine drama.

By the way I couldn't really believe when I had known about the fact of Nicolas Cage's being 20 years in his performance. The leading line is a story about perfect friendship of a pair of opposites and this friendship seems so weird to me because of a great contrast between 2 different persons, but maybe it is attraction of opposites there. But this story is only general background for unveiling such global problems an individual and society and their conflicts, the meaning of dreams for human, freedom, humanity, types of love, human faith and one of the key ideas about People need each other, homo homini amicus est. I don't like making a distinction between Birdy and El as introvert and extrovert, or a man with poor in spirit and a man with a willing spirit, cause both sides had fears and were weakling, thinking that they would run away. Nicolas Cage's character was trying to escape from himself, Matthew Modine's character wanted to shelter from a cold reality under his solitary shell. Unfortunately, they both were egregiously wrong, that's why I reckon that no one was mentally stronger and consequently they were in need of support from each other. Towards the end of the movie it becomes more and more depressive - Cage's final monologue is totally hopeless, 2 crazy men having no way out. However, the final scene so purifies that you will be feeling a huge relief after all, despite a constant exertion throughout the ending. There's nothing to say about brilliant playing of Modine and Cage - they did awesome work, really young geniuses. The Alan Parker's movie is a kind of trip from high-state dreams into the core of the hell called life sometimes .

Though it has a lot of the 80's feel in it (especially in Peter Gabriel's wonderful soundtrack), it aged far less than many films of its time, and while it plays around with various clichés, it refuses to go all the way with any of them, and so manages to be fresh and surprising even now.A lot of that originality may be missed when referring to Birdy as a war film, or a story about PTSD. The film follows two friends and Vietnam vets before and after the wars, through intersecting flashbacks - a familiar tool in war films. But this time the flashbacks are as important as the scenes taking place in the present; the war experience, surprisingly, is only one example - maybe the ultimate one - of society bringing down people that live on its fringes, which is what Birdy is all about. It's a buddy film, a psychological drama, a social critique, a film about friendship and madness and non-conformism, and maybe a coming-of-age story (or a not-coming of age story), but war plays a much smaller part than might seem at first, and wisely, 'Nam flashbacks (which we've seen so many of in so many films) are few and saved till the very end.Special attention should go to the two lead actors - Nicholas Cage and Matthew Modine, both in the very early stages of their careers and both supplying one of the definitive performances of their careers (in Modine's case probably the peak of his career). They create real, full, flawed characters, aided by Alan Parker's sensitive directorial work and by poetic, beautiful cinematography. The film deals with some difficult and very dark questions, but it manages to keep the audience interested and even entertained without compromising its message. The 80's feel does pop-up every now and then, and some of the flashbacks to the 50's and early 60's rely too heavily on well-tried clichés of period films (most jarringly, the use of La Bamba and other hits of the time period in certain scenes, clashing with the beautiful score).

I had never heard of Nicolas Cage and barely heard of Matthew Modine. I was also interested at the prospect that this was an Alan Parker Film. I had no idea what the movie was about and therefore had no preconceptions; which I believe is the best way to go into a movie -- especially a good one! What I saw was incredible. The fact that Nicolas Cage had virtually his entire face bandaged through the current scenes of the film and yet could still evince the feelings of a man suffering with post-war trauma said a great deal about his acting prowess. What really moved me about Birdy was its atmospheric quality. From the Brooklyn mean streets, where the boys grew up, to the asylum, to the first person view of Birdy's pet parakeet, Alan Parker's direction filled these experiences with life and verve. Of course, combine this with a Peter Gabriel soundtrack that was both familiar and alien to the Peter Gabriel fan and you have one excellent film.

It does lend itself to a number of interpretations, most of which say more bout the viewer than the film ).Birdy (Matthew Modine) is a kid obsessed with birds. With the help of a childhood friend (Nicholas Cage) we trace his life from a lower-class urban childhood to the military asylum he inhabits today, looking for the root cause of his trauma.***Minor spoilers ahead***To me, Birdy was about simple people trying to cope with a large, and often cruel, world. There is the recurring theme of authority figures pushing them into roles they don't want. Their parents, the police, the dog-catcher/butcher, and finally the army, all trying to use or control them in some way. Each finds a way to escape the pressures, Cage by immersing himself in typical boyish pursuits like weightlifting and girls, and Modine in his fantasies of flight (a typical metaphor for freedom). For Modine, the inability to fit into the pre-defined roles becomes so overwhelming that the lines between fantasy and reality blur.In the end, they find that the only real way they've coped so far is to draw strength from each other, to say screw the world and grab a few precious moments of shared insanity and freedom (liberating the dogs, attempting to fly using man-made wings and a bicycle, and, of course, the final scene).All in all, a touching and funny movie who's message is sometimes lost on people. I can't guarantee you'll love it, but I did.If nothing else, I thought the film was worth watching for the last 30 seconds (....what?...). Enjoy ).

It's a crying shame that Birdy never got the bravado it deserved then and now simply and I never really understood why. I mean it's well-focused, the characters are endearing and the film itself stands on its own above over-rated and convoluted films that depends on CGI and high-budgeted goodies.It's primary focus is centred on the camaraderie between of two buddies Al Columbato (Nicolas Cage in one of his earliest starring roles) who has recently been returned home from the horrors of the Vietnam War. However his friend Birdy (an outstanding Matthew Modine) who was left hospitalized under psychological evaluation. The opening half of the movie runs at a snail's pace as Al pays a visit to Birdy as he attempts to revive his sanity by going through flashbacks to their teenage years.As the story progresses, Birdy's past is starting to take form and the viewer starts to observe is compassion and curious fixation with birds, that continually increase to epic proportions as he rapidly decreases his association with people and what he's gone through. Birdy now lives in his own world and the only touch of reality he has is his friend who's making strives to get a better understanding of his mind and how it's working.Director Alan Parker expertly touches upon a myriad of touching subjects all into one film. It deals with issues like isolation, questioning one's sanity, how friendship is put to the test, insubordination and connections. Parker succeeds in refraining from making these characters melancholy and grim by making it sincere in studying the characters primarily on the two leads (Cage and Modine). Modine was very believable as the weak and vulnerable Birdy who has strangely adapted to his new world and oblivious to the world in which he lives now.The film also has a gripping coming of age scenario as well Parker avoids from using clichés and we see a simple honest bonding between two friends. The slow pace was a benefit for the development of the characters and the cinematography adds the perfect touch to the creepy and unpredictable mood to the story.and at times some scenes are hard to adjust making the atmosphere quite uncomfortable.Birdy should be highly recommended and has plenty to offer. It's recommended to those you may know who have felt different, a social outcast to society and how it feel when the world out there never fully understand who you really are. It's frustrating and this movie succeeds in exhibiting the kind of predicament everyone may have experienced in their lifetime.

In my opinion, it is a classic that everybody should watch once but I also have mixed feelings about it. The plot is fairly simple. When 2 childhood friends come back from Vietnam among the casualties, one has lost it, the other is disfigured and will try to connect to his friend and bring him back from the crazies. In terms of harsh topics, Birdy is no testing ground for Parker. With this movie, the director deals with post-war mental and physical trauma as well as the struggle to fit in as a high schooler. On one hand, the combination of the Peter Gabriel-made soundtrack and the flying camera shots really convinced me. On the other, I thought it beats around the bush for quite a while. Nicolas Cage's monologues are a bit sketchy even though his overall performance is good. Matthew Modine makes a convincing quiet and deranged bird-lover. As I'm no war-movie enthusiast, I appreciate the fact that Birdy only shows a few war scenes. The plot is largely based on childhood flashbacks.

Through various symbolic episodes, Wharton and Parker sketch the world as a horrible place at worst, illogical at best. Birdy is so dumbfounded by the inanities of human society (and biology) that he turns his nose up to a beautiful girl's breasts. They're just mammary glands, he shrugs.Birdy's desire for flight, for escaping a kind of cruel corporeality, are cut short by the Vietnam war. He's shipped off, sees untold horrors, and then returns to America believing himself to be a bird. He's then locked away in a mental hospital. In other words, the war accelerated Birdy's desire for escape. Vietnam's horrors pushed him over the edge, pushed him into a kind of comfortable fantasy land where he no longer has to confront a humanity he deplores.With Birdy drifting further and further away from humanity, his best friend Al, played by Nicholas Cage, struggles to nurse him back to health. It is only when Al breaks down and confesses his own hatred of the world, that Birdy realises that he is not alone and returns from his self imposed avian exile. The film's point you're not alone, the world violates everyone, everyone suffers, so step out of the box, release your ignis fatuus and hold somebody's hand. Yes, I'm making this stuff sound cheesier than the actual film is.The film is mostly worth watching for Modine and Cage, both of whom turn in a couple of excellent performances. Modine is all internal, invisible pain, while Cage is extroverted, scars on his flesh and tongue. The film is itself a tragi-comedy, a difficult mood to capture. But Parker's does well. He tapes into the nervous energy of youth, the pleasant glow of young friendship, and wisely tones things down when the film ventures into darker territory.8/10 &#x96; Parker specialises in overrated, obvious and overcooked dramas. This film is a bit different, though, thanks largely to Modine, Cage and Wharton. Worth one viewing.

When I watched Birdy I was thrilled by the sheer audacity of the ending; yet while it is undoubtedly funny, it is quite possibly too clever for its own good.  I laughed, but at the same time I at once felt suspicious about the motive of the director, as if the entire film had been revealed as nothing more than an elaborate overture to a punch-line.  The reason the scene works as a joke is because we have grown to take the events of these characters' lives seriously.  From a point of view that is in keeping with the dramatic tone *of the rest of the *entire* movie*, one can ask how the film might (indeed, one may say *should*) have ended.  The answer is *obviously* not the ending we are given, since the joke works because of its surprise factor.  Thus, I must question the wisdom of Parker's decision here, my mischievous delight at a chance for a great 'gag' notwithstanding.  Should the integrity and sincerity of the careful artistry that had gone into the previous 119 minutes *really* be risked on a 'gag' in this way?As one might say Beautiful Girls is only worth watching for Natalie Portman, one might equally say that Birdy is (largely)worth watching for the ending; and that is an indictment of the film.

Opposites attract, and the two are fast friends - almost lovers, although Cage prefers bleacher quickies, and Modine could only make it with a canary (curiously, he names one Al). In the present, Harkins tells the unsuccessful Cage his time is running out, but Cage must help either cure Modine, or lose his own sanity.This is great film-making from director Alan Parker and frequent cinematographer Michael Seresin; hopefully, they haven't tired of working together. Birdy also catches Modine and Cage in perhaps their best young career roles. The supporting cast isn't given a lot to do, but they do it well.

I know several people who don't agree with me, but in my opinion, his performance makes even the worst movie worth a try. Not that it always saves them, but it sure helped me to sit through some of them. However, in this case that isn't even necessary. Ever since I saw Birdy for the first time, I am a fan of its story.When Al Columbato meets Birdy for the first time, he thinks he's a bit of a weirdo. Birdy isn't all that interested in social contacts with other children or young adolescents. All he wants is to play with his pigeons. But after a while Al and Birdy become good friends who have a lot of fun together, especially when they go after some new pigeons for Birdy or when try to fly themselves,... But then the Vietnam war starts and it doesn't take long before both men are sent to this far Asian country. When they return they both have changed. Especially Birdy is in an awful state. Suffering from severe shell-shock, he is in a hospital for mental patients, where he sits in his room without speaking a word while acting like a bird. When Al is asked to help with his therapy by trying to talk to him, he does his best, but even he doesn't seem capable to penetrate into Birdy's isolated world...I know that I've once said that Hollywood doesn't seem to be able to make original drama's which are a lot better than the average TV-movie, but I admit that that was an exaggeration. Birdy is a very good and really original movie which can stand a test with movies like for instance the English drama Spider. Not only is the story very good, so is the directing and the acting. Even though I've heard of him before, I can't say that I've ever seen another movie of Alan Parker, but this Birdy sure proves that the man must be a good director. Also very interesting in this movie were the very young Nicolas Cage, John Harkins - who has more often played in TV-movies and series than in other movies, but who did a good job in this one - and Matthew Modine who hasn't played any big role in an important movie since the late 1980's.The only problem many people might have with this movie is the fact that it is said to be a war movie, but doesn't really show much of the action typical for such movies. It's a part of the story of course, but it isn't as important as some people might want. Also the fact that it is a - for Hollywood at least - quite unusual drama, might cost it quite some viewers. Personally I didn't have any problem with that, I'm already used to watch the 'not-so-average' movie and I must say that this one still stands after all those years. That's why I give it a 7.5/10, maybe even an 8/10.

At worst, it's a blushing admission that in choosing to stray from the original source material, they ran out of ideas of their own and decided to cut their losses then and there. At best, judging from the comments of others, it's a work of unexpected genius. At the end of the day, I suppose it's up to you alone to decide.But, with that one major reservation now out of the way, I can move swiftly onto the praise, and for 99.9% of the time, 'Birdy' really is a captivating, unfairly forgotten gem. I was first drawn to it having picked up the soundtrack in a discount CD outlet, noticing that it had been provided by none other than one of my all-time favourite musicians, the incredible Peter Gabriel. Taking it home and giving it a spin, and, as always with this man, finding myself elevated to a whole other musical dimension, it wasn't long before I was rushing back into the outside world to rent the movie itself. And, having seen it, I was impressed &#150; if they'd searched for a million years they couldn't have found a more fitting picture for him to exercise his audio talents upon, assembling, in typical Peter Gabriel fashion, an evocative, haunting and spiritual score, all virtues which 'Birdy' itself wears proudly on its sleeve.The music certainly compliments it nicely, but it's the strong lead performances from Matthew Modine and Nicholas Cage that truly make this drama, and transfer the characters so vividly and convincingly from William Wharton's original novel (which I decided to tackle not too long after seeing the film). On the whole, I'd say they did a respectable job in translating the non-linear structure of the novel to film, alternating between the contrasting viewpoints of the two young protagonists in accordance to whichever stage of their lives it deals with &#150; the cynical, down-to-earth Alfonso, having returned from combat in Vietnam with severe physical scarring, contemplates the present situation, in which he's been called upon to get through to an old friend and fellow veteran, who's suffered psychological scarring from his own encounters and since withdrawn into his own seemingly inaccessible world. This friend's outlook, meanwhile, is gradually revealed through a series of flashbacks accounting their youthful past growing up together, along with his own lifelong fascination with birds and their ability to fly, a deeply-rooted passion which earned him the nickname 'Birdy'. The world, as seen from his perspective, is positively mesmerising in some scenes, while sharply poignant in others, but rest assured, there's never anything crazy about it. And this is where the true binding magic of this picture lies. Modine's portrayal and Parker's direction make it clearer to us than to any of the characters that Birdy is merely an exceptional kid who's never really been much taken with the conventions and restrictions that come with being a human being, drawn instead to the boundless and enigmatic world of his feathered companions. By contrasting the drabness of the former and the beauty of the latter, Parker ensures that Birdy's stances never seem anything but understandable, and allows us to feel a connection with him right from the beginning. Even before we've learnt the entire scope of his story, in those scenes reflecting more Alfonso's viewpoint, when Birdy resides in an institution, and does outwardly appear to have lost himself, we never doubt him. Parker has also taken full advantage of the story now being visual, employing some truly striking aesthetic imagery along the way. The non-dialogue window scenes in particular, in which Birdy gazes out at the birds flying freely in the world outside, are shot with so much beauty and emotion, they're each worth more than a million words.At the opposite side of the story, Cage also does wonders with Alfonso. In the novel he was drawn up as a much more self-assured, mean-spirited character you only really began to feel sympathy for toward the end. Here, Cage breathes such sympathetic life into the man that it's almost impossible not to feel for him from the moment you lay eyes on him. There's just something about that bandage-clad face that only really speaks to you when it's right out in front of you.There may be a sparse number of scenes that lean more toward the dull and slow-moving side, and which keep it from being perhaps as consistently engaging as it should, but with plenty of others to entrance you, shock you, amuse you and move you, moments that will summon a real lump in your throat and an ending which, depending on how you look at it, will either greatly awe or greatly frustrate you, 'Birdy' may not be an instant classic, but it's a viewing experience unlike any other, and undoubtedly a must-see.Grade A- "},{"Title":"Still a great film.","Date":"1 September 2003","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, War","Review":"  I haven't read through all the comments of others on this film, but most of them are pretty much right on cue, with a few exceptions.  I feel compelled to express my opinions of the movie, since it has always been one of my favorite Alan Parker films, along with The Wall, and a few other notably good films of his mentioned by others.  This movie, along with The Wall, have had a huge impact on more than one person's life in this world, and that says a great deal on its own.  It had been one of my favorites nearly 20 years ago when I was beginning college, and the quest toward independent life, searching for your place in the world, your identity and your own personal meaning in life.  This is what the movie (story) is about to me. There is a lot of generalization about insanity, mental illness, the war, the human bonding of two friends; and they're all true; but there's so much more here.  The symbolism of searching for yourself, flight equaling freedom; authoritarian symbols, from war, to the military, from your parents to just about everything else we question in life.  Birdy is different because he (and those who identify with him) yearn to be free, not just in the literal sense, but as a free spirit, an individual in a world full of normalcy.  Parker does an excellent job of direction, cinematography is in many respects still ahead of its time and acting is top notch.  Parker's use of film as character memory in this film is among the first I encountered and I still find it equal to many other great directors who have used it to tell a story to this day.  I can hardly find better performances by Modine or Cage anywhere in their vast catalog. Cage comes close in many films and probably equals it in others, but for as early as this was on his career, put in context, it's nearly impossible to beat.  It's too bad Cage hasn't had a decent role in many years.  As for Modine, nothing comes close to this performance that I've witnessed.  I find it interesting that I didn't read anyone's comments about the soundtrack by Peter Gabriel, which was borrowed a great deal from his 'Security' release, probably one of his finest, and is easily on par with his work for Last Temptation of Christ, The Rabbit Proof Fence and others.  This is what partly drew me into the film so many years ago, and I'm sure his having worked on it is no coincidence, as he typically only gets involved in projects which say a great deal about humanity. Highly recommended, a very conservative 7/10 vote.

Al also had his tragedious experience in the war.  They both need cures, and helped each other.  Their unique friendship is another delicate point in this movie.

During the flash back sequences, which dominate the film, there is never a real sense of reality.  It looks like two teenage boys who know they are living their lives in front of an audience.  You also know you're in trouble when the most emotional scene in a movie involves a death of a bird.

It's a wonderful piece of nostalgia melded with war-horror, friendship and psychological drama as Cage's character tries to retrieve his buddy from the ultimate retreat into himself. Cage is a bit wooden here, but Modine is fine and the minor changes to the story Parker makes are OK. 8 of 10 stars.

Instead of an ode to friendship, I got a social studies essay on Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome!  The film was too clinical, not poetic enough, and the unexpectedly cheerful ending is both unrealistic and pointless. Movie-makers are terribly uptight about homoerotic implications. To counteract the danger, these words are put into one of the boys' mouth  We're friends, but we're not queer about each other!! What a huge sigh of relief! The movie's unwitting subject was friendship, but the writer was too afraid to admit it to himself. He preferred the illusion of believing he was just telling a story about Vietnam vets.

Some situations are TOO clumsy to be true and actors help to ruin the badly executed scenes. It is, in fact, maybe director's fault, since he is the one who should avoid this kind of amateur scenes.

The direction is excellent, with a great camera managing. Some of the scenes are very artistic and moving, such as those of Birdy inside his room in the asylum, crouched as a bird. Parker really demonstrated his storytelling ability in this film, which is very dynamic, but at the same time artistic and smart.Anyway, and despite of all that's written above, Birdy isn't a great movie. The acting from both of the main characters is quite good, but the movie still seams to lack something. And that's what takes us to the story. Personally, i think it doesn't make up to all the technical aspects of the film. It's a story that isn't meant to be great and to be remembered. It simply entertains.Perhaps some aspects of it could have been more explored by the director, in order to give the film a more personal character, though Parker's hand in it is easily recognizable.

Now imagine they're best friends even though the annoying one doesn't really seem to give a damn and the average one has no understandable reason for his apparent deep love for the annoying one. Throw in some facial bandages on Nic Cage (I guess they want to take his face off) and random scenes of animal abuse, you and you have Birdy. This movie is mostly charmless and pointless. Even the score, which was composed by Peter Gabriel, sounds like some rinker dink low talent crap. This score suits the movie, it's lame and unmemorable. I guess the music did sometimes bring a heightened tension to things; even though nothing would actually happened in a scene, the thudding drum beats still quickened my heart rate a little.I don't have many good things to say about Birdy. It was slightly interesting at points. Nic Cage did a fairly good job of delivering a relatively normal character, but the story gave the character so little motive or meaning. The ending could have been worse /Spoilers/ I actually liked that Birdy didn't fly to his death, even though that would have been a rather fitting way to end the character, it would have been depressing and just made the movie seem like an even bigger waste of time. /End Spoilers/Mainly this movie annoyed and bored me. I was unable to relate to much of anything. Certain animal scenes disturbed and troubled me. I don't feel there is much point to this movie. So unless you just like watching an obsessed birder get freaky or you just really want to see Nicolas Cage play what may be his most restrained role, I recommend you skip Birdy.

There is a graphic scene involving the death of an animal. I never take animal deaths well, but I can usually make it through a film even if it has animals dying.In Birdy though, I got so wrapped up in the unlikely friendship between Nicolas Cage and Matthew Modine and the insight and history of Modine's character, that I was just so invested in the film, that when this very unsettling graphic death of an animal occurred, I couldn't take it anymore. I had to immediately turn it off and not finish the film.What makes this worse is the fact that I was enjoying the characters and development and interesting story. After talking with a friend who had previously seen the movie and recommended it to me, he said the version he saw didn't have that scene and that it really doesn't add anything to the story. So apparently they made two versions of this scene, one that is watchable and one that isn't.I'm supposed to take to heart that this was fictional and no animals were harmed in the making, but it was still a very upsetting film viewing experience. If you have no heart, perhaps then you can make it through Birdy. But I think it's time to start protesting the use of graphic violent deaths just to increase controversy and turn people off. I'm turning off Birdy and will never recommend it, just because of that one scene.

Alan Parker directed in a keen, outré manner, but also with a very heavy hand; several sequences which might have been strong (a surprise visit to a slaughterhouse, a bird's death after flying into a window) instead become extreme examples of Parker's preening style, teeter-tottering madly between vulgar bravado and sappy, false sentiment. Modine is a strong, focused actor, but this leading role is rather woebegone--culminating with an exceptionally uncomfortable scene where Birdy has a flying wet-dream (many viewers might give up on the film right there). Cage's role--the sensible one--isn't as showy (or obvious), yet he's the one keeping this flighty material grounded and he comes off better than Modine.
