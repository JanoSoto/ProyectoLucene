Great acting.","Date":"10 June 2003","Score":"53 out of 61 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  Don't rent this film if you are the kind of movie watcher/goer who doesn't like to have their brain engaged. (i.e. you only want car chases, explosions, bouncing boobies and bathroom humor.) You will be very disappointed.I adored this movie and will purchase it as soon as I can get my hands on a copy. Why do I adore it? A few reasons.First, it is not your run-of-the-mill story. The time travel concept is handled in a very interesting way. The back story, the photograph, the father's phone number -- all keep you wondering as they do Ruby (Tomei's character). Too, I appreciated the way the viewer is never quite sure (until the end -- and I won't give it away) if Sam (D'Onofrio's character) is really telling the truth or really is mentally/physically ill. I had a roommate for seven years who was bi-polar and borderline psychotic. It was scary how true this movie was in terms of what happens to the people who are dealing with (at least supposedly) mentally ill individuals.  The writing and Tomei's acting portrayed the enabling, co-dependant thing perfectly and how these types of relationship can spiral into dangerous places.Secondly, I liked the fact that the whole movie (except for a few brief shots at the beach and the ending) was filmed with a hand held camera. It gave it an almost documentary-like feel. I think the intimacy of the hand held kept the viewer's focus on the characters, rather like sitting in the room and looking back and forth between them. It also underscored their emotions, thereby grounding us in their reality. It just sucks you in. Because of this I never got a sense that this movie was trying to be a SciFi flick, and I don't think it was intended to be. The jerkiness of the hand held also was a reminder, subtle or not, of the shakey ground these characters were treading both separately and together.Third and last. D'Onofrio's performance. Outstanding. Man, he continually blows me away! His Sam had to be completely gentle and innocent on one hand, but very threatening and creepy on the other. Sam was so engaging and sweet at first but towards the middle of the film, while retaining those qualities, I was really beginning to wonder if he was a physical threat to Ruby. A fine edge to walk as an actor. And all the future and time theory babble was handled with apparent ease. I believed him. D'Onofrio has the ability to just melt into a character's skin, to completely transform himself. He gives it all.(On that note, there have been many in these reviews who say he usually plays evil characters and are surprised by this performance. He has done a few bad guys, but it is his other roles I love best. If you enjoy his work PLEASE check out - if you have not done so already - The Whole Wide World, Household Saints, Steal This Movie, and Good Luck. All good movies made GREAT by his performances. In my opinion he's one of the best out there and very under-rated.)The only thing I didn't like in the film was the score. It just didn't work for me.I felt it was intrusive and much too jarring. It seems like a misguided afterthought. For me, if I notice the score over the performances or it interrupts my ability to follow the story, it isn't doing it's job well.

This movie successfully ventures into interesting and largely untested ground.The story is about a man (Vincent D'Onofrio) who becomes romantically involved with a woman (Marisa Tomei) who has a history of co-dependence and failed relationships.  He claims that he is from the future. The plot takes us on the journey of their relationship and her questioning of the truth to his claims vs. whether he is another in a string of loser guys that she seems to cling to.The plot synopsis sounded a little odd, but it was my hope that these two talented actors could pull it off.  Both Tomei and D'Onofrio turn in excellent performances.  They present complex, interesting and flawed characters who engage our interest.  The writing is very good and enjoyable.My only complaint is the the story sags a little about 2/3 of the way through.  A little tighter editing of about 10 minutes of essentially redundant scenes would have made the movie a more engaging.I rate it a 8/10 and encourage those who like well-written, character-driven movies to check this one out.

It's romantic dramedy at its best, with two memorable characters portrayed by highly skilled and REAL actors.   In fact both Tomei and d'Onofrio are close to perfect in these roles.It's a premise that continues to develop over the entire span of the film, never becoming predictable or plot-driven.It offers striking supporting performances from Holland Taylor and Jose Zuniga, and a flat-out GREAT scene with Tovah Feldshuh that's driven by subtle and moving screenwriting.It offers memorable and witty cameos from Mike McGlone and Anthony (just call me Michael) Hall.

This romantic comedy plays out beautifully on the screen and the element of time travel is handled with a refreshing spin of originality.Both Tomei and D'onofrio provide captivating performances the range of emotions they both convey make their chemistry on screen very pleasant to watch and their characters very believable.I also found the score to be an interesting touch that adds a light air of wonderment and mystery in just the right spots. My favorite spots were the flute solo in the beginning after Sam (D'onofrio) meets Ruby (Tomei) outside her apartment, it adds a feeling of innocence to a situation that ordinarily would not be described as such. The second is at the end when they meet at the intersection of Chrystie and Delancy after the much anticipated moment passes.Please rent this movie and discover your own reasons for falling in love with it.

This one failed to disappoint, especially because of the superb acting and camera shots. Vincent D'Onofrio(still the bug from Men in Black in my mind) did a wonderful job of stepping out of that role and into one that's believable, despite Sam's odd story. The first time I watched this, I was intrigued by the possibility that Sam may be telling the truth. Fortunately, K-Pax hadn't managed to ruin that scenario completely for me. The ending was a complete surprise and there were some nice twists.I picked this up again to see if it was still as intriguing and to my surprise, it was. Even knowing Sam's true identity takes none of the emotion out of the film. I saw that this movie is not just the audience deciding whether or not to believe Sam, but Ruby deciding as well. It's a terrific inner conflict for her, as she struggles in the face of love and honesty after a string of horrible men. Haven't we all met someone that we loved and wanted to trust, but we didn't know we could? The time travel aspect makes this movie impossible but the characters are so real and deep, then the movie feels real and you find yourself thinking if only for a moment that it is perfectly possible. That's why I say that even if you know the ending, watch this movie for the quality that it is.

I had never heard of it before through the mass media; perhaps that's because nothing gets blown up in the movie, no guns are drawn, and only a few punches are thrown. Instead, Marisa Tomei and Vincent D'Onofrio mostly interact with each other (as aided and abetted by Tomei's therapist and girl-friends). (Nowadays, does that make it a chick-flick?)One cautionary note If you've seen K-Pax, you may feel Happy Accidents is a bit derivative, almost like a trip back into the past, but hang in there. If you're a fan of either Tomei or D'Onofrio (probably most famous for his role as the bug from Men in Black), or even if you're just looking for a pleasant way to pass an hour and fifty minutes, catch this the next time it comes around on cable/satellite -- you won't be disappointed.

He lands in the Village, in Manhattan! What a natural setting for a movie that wants us to believe there is a chance for romance between an evolved man who has lived in the future, and a single young woman struggling to make a go of a career and to find the love of her life!Brad Anderson, a director we have admired before, is at the helm of this sunny comedy that connects two dissimilar people as they find one another and fall in love. Ruby a teacher from Manhattan one day meets Sam in a park, casually. Sam is taken with her and goes looking for her to return the book she left behind. Sam, who acts strangely, reveals he has traveled backward in time, something that Ruby can't digest too quickly, but his charm and good humor wins her over in a romance that could only happen to people like them.In spite of their differences, and the many questions in Ruby's mind, the relationship between these seemingly different characters, are never quite solved, but it's easy to see why she is attracted to a man that clearly loves her. In fact, Sam makes a dire prediction about Ruby that fortunately never comes true. In the end, one realizes these lovers are made to be together in spite of the times they have seen.Ruby is played by Marisa Tomei with the proper skepticism. The Sam of Vincent D'Onofrio is also right because he gives the character a whimsical quality that wins Ruby's love. The two actors have the right chemistry on the screen to sustain the comedy and our interest in it. Holland Taylor is delightful as Ruby's therapist. Tovah Feldshuh is seen as Ruby's mother, in a winning performance and Nadia Najani plays Gretchen, the best friend anyone can ask for.Happy Accidents shows Brad Anderson at his best with his inspired take on love at the end of the millennium.

But it's great enough to want to buy the DVD and keep it in your collection forever. I just stumbled upon it on the Blockbuster rack.It seems implausable at first. How could a romantic comedy be based on a whacko guy who thinks he's a time traveler from the year 2470? But surprisingly Marisa Tomei and Vincent D'Onofrio not only manage to pull it off, they make it credible and memorable. No small credit should go to the movie editors and director who made it all work with just the right amount of revelation at the right time, so when the movie ends it all fits together. Back in the old days they called that coming to a dramatic climax. Ya gotta see this one beginning to end.Maybe it was the R rating only for langauge that turned some folks off to this flick when it first came out. Truth is a little editing could have made it a PG-13 easily and could have earned Marisa another Oscar. D'Onofrio was just so darned likeable in this flick, you'd want to nominate him for an Oscar too.I guess this is what happens when great little movies get lousy advertising and promotion when they come out.

It is a strong character-driven story about a man named Sam Deed who traveled back in time from the year 2470 to avoid prosecution for his sister's accidental death, to resolve the issues of his life and to find himself. In our contemporary society, he meets and falls in love with Ruby Weaver, a woman who has had much bad luck with men. Sam seems to be a good guy but as this site's summary says someone not of this world. She thinks he's delusional (but I cannot blame her, as anyone would if someone claimed to be from the future--- I mean as time travel is not possible, as of yet anyway!). However, Ruby goes on to appreciate Sam for himself and wants to stay with him, making for a definite good story line for a great film.One of the greatest things of this film, at least in my opinion is that it is a contrast to many futuristic-style stories in that it has a somewhat happy tone. I will not risk spoiling the film here for those who haven't seen it by telling the major plot details or the ending, but it is a wonderful contrast to most stories involving the world of the future. Everyone knows the type, the futuristic sci-fi cinemas talking about in sometimes graphic detail of evil corporations and totalitarian governments and world dictatorships; the kind of films that seem to be designed to drain the hope from people. This film is a wonderful story of adventure, romance and hope and grand possibilities. The kind of film which can uplift one's spirits rather than drain them with evil forecasts for a future of world dictatorships and universal totalitarianism. Therefore, I have to give this film a 10!

In the end, my not knowing the plot allowed him to slowly reveal -why- he's so darn weird. Why a woman would accept this behavior is another matter, and I'm not sure if this is explained to my satisfaction, but the performances by D'Onofrio and Tomei resonate so well as to melt my cynicism. These are two real people, and they meet the final test I was perfectly willing to accept the main character as crazy, time traveling, or whatever else he turned out to be, and to let the chips fall where they may accordingly. All is in place to let this story go either way,(up to the last revealing scene with the therapist), and the acting itself has no cheap giveaways. Even the 'death' scene, which would have been unlikely if no time traveling had actually occurred, was at least -remotely- possible on mundane level due to the actions of D'Onofrio in traffic and with the cabbie.

However, when we piece everything together, maybe it wasn't an accident at all, maybe he knew exactly where she would be that day. You see, he claims to be from the year 2470, Iowa on the Atlantic coast, where they have learned the art of back traveling.some SPOILERS -- Like K-Pax the viewer has to decide whether the main character actually was what he claimed to be, or just crazy. As the events unfold most of us decide that he really is a back traveler, for several reasons. First, he appears to know that she will die on a certain day, at a certain intersection in NYC, run over by a taxi driver. Second, he meets up with someone he claims he recognizes from 2469, who must have back traveled a year earlier. And third, it appears near the end of the film that Tomei's shrink is also a back traveler. more SPOILERS - A side-effect of back traveling almost 500 years is that you have some residual oscillations which occasionally make things continue go backwards for short periods. The film actually begins with people and traffic in the street moving in reverse, then forward, as he watches from a window. Later, he gets nauseated during a dinner with her parents when he is watching food come out of the mother's mouth, re-assemble itself on the fork, then move onto her plate, not yet eaten. This ultimately works to his advantage when, in spite of his warnings, she leaves the apartment and is about to cross the street at the fatal intersection. He gets there and, as the speeding car is about 6 inches from mowing her down, he is able to back travel for a few seconds, just long enough to clear the path and save her.D'Onofrio and Tomei are two of my very favorite actors and both are fine in this film. The story is captivating and very believable, within the context of a science fiction film.

Tomei throws a hissy fit every few minutes and acts like she severely needs Prozac. She's in therapy for her co-dependency, quotes what her therapist tells her to do, and recites affirmations to a mirror.I tried watching it with my boyfriend and we turned it off after 10 minutes because neither of us wanted to see an overly dramatic, nutcase whine for 90 minutes. I decided to try watching it on my own. I adored Next Stop Wonderland, so I wanted to see more from the same director/writer. Happy Accidents isn't as polished as Next Stop Wonderland and I was very surprised to find out it was made after Next Stop Wonderland.After the first 10 minutes the film gets very strange. It is definitely not a typical romantic comedy. All of sudden turns into a sci-fi movie about 15 minutes into the film. I knew nothing about the plot before watching it and I think that really helped my enjoyment. I can usually predict where a film is going, but not this one.The pace is a bit frenzied. Instead of exploring dating like in Next Step Wonderland, Happy Accidents focuses on one relationship. The film is actually quite funny. I convinced my boyfriend to give it a second try and he really liked it after the character Sam Deed enters the picture. Vincent D'Onofrio is perfect in the role and the script is very creative.The over-acting in the film is a bit over-the-top for my taste and there are some weak points in the plot, but Happy Accidents is really worth watching.

The idea seemed good going on the DVD cover, but the reality is tedious and at time irritating.It could have been OK if only the scriptwriter hadn't had verbal diarrhoea and if the female lead hadn't acted the part far too often in a fit of hysteria. We have to endure groups having arty conversations that have very little to do with the plot - at times nothing at all that I could see, and worse, are excruciatingly boring.The heroine is irritatingly dim. She's had a history of loser lovers and when you watch her you aren't going to be very surprised about that. When her futuristic lover turns up, she's unable to listen to him trying to explain his situation because she's just too thick to understand anything much of what he's talking about. She doesn't have to believe him, but she could at least have some grasp of science and time so that the guy could feel he's talking to a woman with a brain. In other words, these two characters are totally unsuited - unless the futuristic visitor really wants just a bimbo? It's somehow not surprising that she has to keep visiting a shrink though she doesn't seem to improve from the visits.The most worrying thing is why this futuristic guy bothered to come back to find Ruby, but I guess it must be that man thing we women hear about that men fall for a girl's looks, not her intellect. This girl doesn't have much intellect. I have to say this may be due to the frenetic way the part is played. Perhaps the actress could have interpreted the script with something more measured than that style which Americans call zany. Perhaps it was all meant to be hilariously funny but I love funny stories and I didn't find much in this movie that's really funny.The hero tries, he really does. He acts the part pretty well. You can feel for him. It would have been good to hear more about his future time but we're told so little it's infuriating.There are a few interesting touches in what's mostly pretty long-drawn-out and disappointing. I particularly liked it whenever we were introduced to other time travellers, particularly the shrink - yes, that was a surprise to me, very clever. But those intro's were so rare and so brief. Once I knew there were others around, I was waiting for them and a few more would have helped liven up the movie.The solution to saving the hero from his problem re how to stay in now is one of those tedious ideas that love will do the trick. It was so, so cheesy. For all we know, it may really be the solution to everything, but I hope not the way it's put over in this movie. This is a movie based on a quite clever sf idea but the s has nearly all gone missing and it's very short on any interesting f.Vaguely watchable if you are desperate for something to see and take a liking to the casting.The issue of what happens if you change history by going back in time is always intriguing. A pity it wasn't treated more seriously in this tale, but I think this movie isn't aimed at sf fans.

Am always a bit wary about movies who have that hand-held independent feel to them, so was bracing myself for something grainy, shaky, aggravating and surreal, with long-winded and disjointed diatribes, but it was far from that. Rather it was tight, smart, captivating and likable, with a fresh and elegant twist of romance, sci-fi and drama. A thinker's love story, if you will, and SUCH nice change from all the painfully dull, perfectly-coif-ed Jennifer Aniston-esque piles of cardboard crap. It even held my boyfriend spellbound for 2 hours, which was amazing, since he usually needs deNiro or Jason Statham to do that job. Of course you can rarely - if ever? - go wrong with d'Onofrio or Tomei, nor Holland Taylor or Nadja Dajani, and seeing them cast together was a huge draw. Great flick!

Sam is a little odd, but nice, and kind, and we learn early on that Ruby has terrible choice in men. When Sam begins to treat her well, she starts falling for him, even as her friends alternately chide and tease her about it.Then Sam drops the bombshell &#150; he's really a time traveler from the year 2470, and he's escaping a hopeless future to live out his life here, in a more settled and peaceful time. Ruby thinks he's nuts, but there's just enough credibility to his story that you can almost believe Sam (and some of the details are hilarious and very well thought out). When Ruby's therapist explains that most of Sam's 'evidence' can in fact be explained away by a rare mental disorder, Ruby doesn't know what to believe.Most of the film lies in the performances. D'Onofrio is excellent here, really sharp, rendering Sam in warm, if confused, tones. It's easy to like him and you want to believe him all the way down the line, even as Ruby sinks deeper into doubt. More importantly, you want to believe *in* him, and there is the movie's triumph; despite being handed a perfectly rational explanation for Sam's behavior, you want him to be from the future. Tomei matches D'Onofrio's performance; Ruby is both needy and skeptical, flawed herself, and she has to decide not only whether Sam is ill or not but whether, since he loves her so well, it really matters. Tomei sketches the vulnerability of the character perfectly.I don't want to spoil how it ends &#150; indeed, I feel like I've spoiled too much already &#150; but the ending is the strongest, best part of the film; so many times we are led around a mystery, and when it is revealed, we're almost always disappointed. Not so here; all the build up pays off wonderfully, and the whole film comes together in a perfect instant. It may have indeed been a happy accident I found this picture, but you should make a point to seek it out; it's worth a viewing, definitely.

It's ostensibly a contemporary love story between two misfits, but he laces the plot with science fiction elements that seem contrived at first until they start to affect the characters tangibly. The irony is that these far-fetched plot developments are what make the movie resonate emotionally. The two people at the center are Ruby Weaver, a single woman with an unfortunate track record of enabling men to meet her lowest expectations, and Sam Deed, a stranger from Dubuque who may be either mentally ill or a time traveler from the year 2470. Ruby is immediately drawn to Sam's sincerity but when he confesses to coming from the future, she inevitably feels like she is recycling old behavior by trying to save him from his delusions.It reminds me a bit of John Carpenter's 1984 Starman (where an alien takes the form of a woman's dead husband) and a touch of Hal Ashby's 1979 Being There (where an insulated gardener tries to make sense of the world around him). However, Anderson puts his own idiosyncratic stamp on the movie by making Sam's seemingly insane assertions credible and Ruby's attraction alternately frustrating and empathetic. The acting by the two leads helps considerably here. Suffering from premature Oscar ejaculation, Marisa Tomei has slowly recovered her acting credentials, and this performance is among her best as she dexterously brings out all the hesitation and vulnerability in Ruby. As Sam, Vincent D'Onofrio tempers his trademark intensity with a genuine sweetness that makes his child-like wonder believable. Holland Taylor effectively tones down her sassy persona to play Ruby's impervious therapist, while Tovah Feldshuh grounds the film with warmth and sensibility as Ruby's mother. The ending is clever with a nice use of stop-motion photography, even if it felt slightly derivative of the legendary Star Trek episode where Bones is stopped from saving a peace-loving missionary (played by Joan Collins, of all people) about to be killed. This one is more infectious than you may be assuming from the set-up.

It has all the marks of an artsy-fartsy independent film--the handheld camera moves, the jumps in time, the improvised scenes--but it works. The fact it works is largely the result of the excellent leading performances by Marissa Tomei and Vincent D'Onofrio. Tomei makes her character (who's a bit of a doormat and whiner) into a likable, realistic person. If there's a better actor at playing characters who can't quite fit in their own skins than D'Onofrio, I haven't seen him. He's splendid in this film, and very funny and touching by turns. He's particularly good in the scene where his character dazzles a classroom of children with his language skills.The writer/director/editor Brad Anderson seems to be a bit self-conscious in his work (some scenes shout Look at me! I'm a quirky independent movie! I'm art!), and some of the film is frustrating. Is Sam Deeds, D'Onofrio's character, really a time traveller? Is he insane? Does it matter? Anderson never really seems to care about this. Then again, this ambiguity is one of the film's strengths. Perhaps the point of HAPPY ACCIDENTS is that love is what matters, rather than time, space, or mental health.It's far from a perfect film, but I'm happy I gave it 2 hours of my life, and I'll probably give it more time in the future.Wardicus "},{"Title":"Fantastic romantic movie with time travel!","Date":"9 August 2003","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  This is one of the best romantic comedies that many have not seen.

The main reason I think this is a bad film, inferior to Session 9 is because it is so banal. The dialogue is banal, which, if it wasn't because of the good acting by both Tomei (despite playing a very annoying an pretentious character) and D'Onofrio, would be obviously ridiculous and pretentious. Even the science fiction element is bad and unimaginative. Of course, it is very difficult to get new ideas on science fiction topics, moreover on time travel, but, at least be a bit mature about it (the anarchist colony idea was kindergarten stupid, if you ask be, an idea that was explored and already ridiculous in the 50s. And a bar-code ID? I didn't think they used that idea anymore! ). It is funny though, in a Jay Leno way, recycling old jokes and situations that have been used a hundred types before about dating, finding Mr. Right etc, and the common paranoid new yorker, reminiscent of Woody Allen and Seinfeld. The film's intelligence is only superficial, those ponderings on the nature of love and relationships are from the mother templates; nothing new.The direction is good though, especially the lighting. Some of the doorway shots are interesting. The interior monologue style of narration is rather fresh (though making it part of a psychiatrist visit  is an often used idea, from 'There's Something About Mary' to 'Timecode').Overall this is lousy story and script.

My one criticism, and I don't think it's a small one, is that the camera work is occasionally awful.  Like, public access television awful.

Vincent D'Onofrio and Marisa Tomei were very very good in this movie.  Marisa plays the type of girl that any woman could relate to, the down to earth, dysfunctional at times, normal single woman.D'Onofrio plays his part to a tee.  If you ever saw Feeling Minnesota, then you can get an idea of what his character is like in this one, the two aren't too much different.Basically he meets Tomei in a park one day, then courts her in the most unusual and humorous fashion.  Now Marisa and her friends have a long history of attracting psychos, and after getting to know him, she realizes that he just may be the king of all the psycho men that she has dated yet!  But psycho in a cute way as opposed to a dangerous way, or so she thinks, but isn't really sure.After probing him, he admits the truth to her about his past, however it is so unbelievable that she just thinks he needs help.  However, this fantasy world that he seems to be living in keeps the relationship from ever getting stale, so rather than dumping him on several different occassions, she decides to keep him around just to see where it leads next, not to mention that there is something about him that she is attracted to. I don't want to give anything away, so I'll just say this.  If you ever saw Kpax, then this movie kind of has the same format.  Spacey in Kpax claims to be something so ridiculously unreal that at first it just seems like he needs mental help.  However, he has an answer for every question that anyone asks him, and by the end of Kpax you are left wondering if he really was telling the truth or not.  Well this is very similar to that.  While D'Onofrio doesn't claim to be from another planet, his claims are just as ludicrous.  Overall, I'd give this at least 4 stars, but seeing how I had absolutely no expectations for this movie that I had never heard of, it far exceeded what I had hoped for, and I really don't a have problem with any of it.  I thought it was very entertaining and time went by fast while watching it, and that usually doesn't happy with me.  I give it 5 stars!

Here's the neat part D'Onofrio's character may or may not be from the future and may or may not be mentally unstable.Shot almost entirely in Brooklyn, Happy Accidents utilizes a grungy, urgent style. The film does well to keep us guessing as to whether or not D'Onofroi's character is insane, and several of the film's mysteries have a fine resolution.While more psychodrama than comedy, the film does have a number of witty lines. It's core idea is also rather funny just when Tomei, who has had limited romantic success, finds Mr Right, he turns out to be completely nuts. Or is he? 7.9/10 &#x96; Worth one viewing.

Sam Deeds (Vincent D'Onofrio) is in love from afar and willing to travel a long way to meet the woman of his dreams--Ruby Weaver (Tomei). Sam is gentle and kind, funny and reliable--in other words, much better than the other jerks Ruby has found herself with over the years. However, he also has a strange tale to tell about the aforementioned journey. Is it true, or is he sick? And does it matter to Ruby? Ruby's friend, Gretchen (Nadia Dajani), her therapist, Maggie (Holland Taylor), and her mother (Tovah Feldshuh) help her figure it out, and each lends her own grace to the film. Tomei, an actress whom I love, leads us through hope, despair, fear, rage, and finally love for Sam. The moral of this engaging story is, of course, that a good man is hard to find--so don't cut bait too quickly. And I have one question that feisty guy at the gallery reception was he or wasn't he?!

The plot takes us on the journey of their relationship and her questioning of the truth to his claims vs. whether he is another in a string of loser guys that she seems to cling to.The plot synopsis sounded a little odd, but it was my hope that these two talented actors could pull it off.  Both Tomei and D'Onofrio turn in excellent performances.  They present complex, interesting and flawed characters who engage our interest.  The writing is very good and enjoyable.My only complaint is the the story sags a little about 2/3 of the way through.

At first his little quirks his fear of dogs, his spells, his drawings amuse her but as she questions him about his life, his story becomes stranger and stranger.

It provides laughs, romance and the ability to take a leap in the realm of the slightly off-beat. It is a magnificent showcase for the talents of the beautiful Marisa Tomei and Vincent D'Onofrio. Why is that a man as talented as D'Onofrio, who keeps on putting in great performances 'Whole Wide World', 'Men In Black', 'The Salton Sea', 'Full Metal Jacket' to name a few is not a star? There are many lesser actors out there winning Oscars and receiving millions of dollars per role and yet the average Joe can't even pronounce D'Onofrio's name? The rest of the cast are also excellent, especially Holland Taylor as Ruby's shrink and a greatly timed cameo from Anthony Michael Hall.

She's a bit of a flake and he's just plain out there.Sam has come back in time to save Ruby from a certain death. As a half-hour `Twilight Zone,' `Happy Accidents' could have been a memorable romantic/science fiction teaser that left you wondering if Tomei ever could get D'Onofrio to the church on time.  As it is, the time traveling motif takes itself too seriously with too many hysterical Tomei scenes and too few of D'Onofrio explaining the delicious differences between the 21st century and the 25th.As a love story, however, this is a keeper.  The two lovers are oddballs whose caring natures get them in and out of trouble with affection. When Tomei's mother confesses her sex life with her husband died when he went on the wagon, you get the idea this romance could also derail if the protagonist weren't weird.  So it's good he might be from another time and she is lovingly out of her own time.If I judge correctly from  `Next Stop Wonderland' as well as `Accidents,' Director Brad Anderson likes these romantic comedies where you wonder if the lovers will really make it.' I do know this from those works the best chance for successful love comes from the souls that are, not the lovers you wish to make them be.

There wasn't much they didn't have. At first I got ideas for films from titles I could remember. Then I consulted IMDb and did searches by actor of director, etc. to get titles.About a month ago, after I ran out of my remembrances and IMDb's cross-references, I searched the public library's catalog by year and media type (DVDs). Browsing through the results, in one recent year, I came across a title that seemed familiar and I right clicked it to find out more. The lead male was Vincent D'Onofrio, an actor I had seen in bit parts in film and TV, but who also was featured in a episode of one of my favorite TV series of all time 'Homicide Life on the Streets'. Yeah, I know. Stupid title. But I swear that show was one of the finest I'd ever seen on TV (bear in mind, I've never had cable). The best cinematography, best editing, best screenplays with the best dialog delivered in the best performances on TV I had ever seen. The episode I saw D'Onofrio in was an episode that was also featured in a two hour PBS documentary 'Anatomy of a 'Homicide Life on the Street', which was also excellent. D'Onofrio did a marvelous job in that episode. So good, I thought I'd like to see him in another lead role. When I came across it in the library catalog search, I decided to order the film even though the library catalog blurb read A single girl with an obsession for fixing the emotional problems of oddball men finally meets a guy who seems normal. The only snag is that he says he came from the future to save her life. Sounded kinda a smaltzy romantic comedy we recently viewed - Kate & Leopold. It even had Marisa Tomei in it.Unfortunately, it arrived with another movie I wanted to see more and so I just saw the first two minutes before I returned it to the library. But that first two minutes was so hypnotic and enticing that I added the D'Onofrio film to the another batch of library requests.Tonight I viewed it. I reran the first two minutes twice and it really wasn't as good as I kinda thought it was a month ago in it's first aborted viewing - it was better. About ten minutes in, I was beginning to think this might turn out to be my favorite film of the last year. About twenty minutes in, I was beginning to think this might turn out to be my favorite film in the last 5 years. About one hour in, I was beginning to think this might turn out to be my favorite film in the last 10 years. By the end of the film, I was beginning to think this might turn out to be my favorite film.This film has some of the best cinematography, best editing, best soundtrack, best sound editing (since The Conversation), best screen writing with the best dialog delivered in the best performances I had ever seen.

I was really pulled in and when I try to describe this movie to others, they think I'm crazy, but how can you not love this movie? It is strange and funny and the actor's are superb. I wish that this movie had gotten a bigger response because it truely is original, but great. The script is so in depth and incredible. How Anderson came up with this world that Sam lives in is beyond me, it is so deep and involved, I wonder how people come up with this stuff...

Thepremise of this film - time travel romance - sounds like something we'd discard as February-release-filler.  For all I know, this movie was released in February. But it actually works!  Marissa Tomei is one of those Oscar winners who didn't really deserve the award and thus quickly retreated from prominent roles. But she's back and does a really nice job.  Even more impressive is the solid,realistic, non-fantastical script.  They let the guy direct it, which I think was really wise.I guess I saw it long enough ago that I don't remember a lot of details, but I highly recommend it.  This is the kind of movie that I normally wouldn't take a chance on, but it was recommended by a good friend and she was right.

Vincent D'Onofrio pulls off one of his most complex, hilarious performances I've seen to date.  Marisa Tomei proves that her Oscar win was not a onetime performance and that she's actually grown as an actress.  The story pulls the rug out from under you about a third the way through going from cuddly to captivating.  Moments of the film are utterly hilarious.  Parts of it border on downright sinister.  I won't give away any details about the ending, but it's a beautiful revelation worthy of some of the best in cinematic history.

Wrong! It may have been a chick flick. But I thought it would never end. It was much too long for the plot. And while I'm knocking it, let me also say that it was much too complicated. I never did completely understand why Sam came back to the present time and the call that Ruby made to Sam's dad. Btw...my husband didn't like it either. He fell asleep early on.

This leads to a number of scenes where the alleged madman or time traveller oscillates between very imaginative/narrative (he tells her about the future), very charming (he tells her he picked that year and place because of an old beautiful photo of her), very crazy (he has moments when he sees time flow backwards, this is the equivalent of jet-lag for time travelers).All in all this gives a number of scenes of unequal quality involving the girls, the guy, the girl's girlfriend, the girl's shrink (also a time-traveller, who came to evade taxes), all in present-day New-York. The scenes are of very unequal quality, and in my view a good number are so weak that they could have been cut altogether.In the end guess what, the girl very nearly gets hit by a car precisedly on the day the guy said she would, and before that she sees a photo of her that looks his drawings of his memories of that future photo of her - so yes, he is a time-traveller indeed!Could have been a charming, non-tech time traveller film. But the editing should have been much stricter. Also, D'Onofrio, with that face and build everyone remembers in either The Cell, or Men in Black (where he was the Cockroach), really does not fit the bill - completely miscast.I gave the film a 6. With a better cast (mainly replacing D'Onofrio), a better pace (thanks to better editing), it could have been a 7 or an 8.

Happy Accidents did absolutely nothing new - too bad - some of the lines were funny and I think the actors were fine but the whole mind-twisting element is one of the flatter versions out there. Ultimately a dull film.

Where to start? This movie is so slow it practically atrophies, none of the characters are interesting or sympathetic, there's too much silence (and when there is music, it's atrocious), the performances are uncomfortable and there's absolutely no hook, no reason to keep watching.I love romantic movies, I love independent movies, and what I love most is quirky independent romantic movies. It's logical to assume that I should have loved this. The problem with this movie is that the screenplay is resoundingly weak - the dialogue is, at times, laughable. The concept - an interesting one - is totally wasted. This could have been a funny/cute little fish out of water flick, but Sam isn't fazed enough by the world 400+ years ago, apart from a fascination with smells.There are no laughs to be had in this movie. It's dreary dreck, and the writer doesn't have the skill to pull off the musy, navel-gazing dialogue he tries so hard to effect. It's embarrassing, frankly.For a good fish out of water movie, try Enchanted. For a good independent movie, try Little Miss Sunshine - after this, we put it on, and tried to understand just why it's so much better than this horrible film.I'd give it a -1 if I could. Had I seen it in the theatre, I would have walked out. Thank God all I had to do was hit stop.

It was such a popular film there they added an 3rd screening  Marisa Tomei and Vincent D'onofrio are in an interesting relationship. Thats all I will say about the plot. A very witty script, good characters, interesting editing, plus a cameo by one of the brat pack (A.M.H.) all add up to an entertaining story. See this movie!!!  "},{"Title":"Stupid movie. Period.","Date":"1 December 2006","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" Have you ever watched a movie without natural dialogues? Would you rather see something with lines only novel writers would use? How about a movie clearly made by amateurs that pretends to talk about time travel, but which ends typical Hollywood style? Now, would you watch a movie that carries unsympathetic weirdoes who even the most troubled person would avoid in real life, such as the unprofessional therapist and one of the more obnoxious guy you'd ever meet? If you were told you'd die in an accident tomorrow, would you eat packaged food brought from the store today? I could go on and on, but I should stop now before I waste even more time than I already have.

Therapist that doesn't know psychology, a best friend who is not.What kind of New Yorker would be OK with someone who finding out where they lived, then followed them to work? Then there is a PhD in physics who gets mad at being called a time traveler? This movie could be good if you love Star Trek The Next Generation. You would love people making up what sound like technical creations and then rattling them off with a bunch of non existent words.If this is a movie you need to pay attention to in order to understand it, then we live in a short attention span country.Side note Some of his theories of time travel are true. Bending time, in order to time travel, does exist.

Both movies were much too long for the tiny bit of plot they contained but this film was by far the worse.  At best the entire story could fill 30  minutes while still maintaining some flow.  Stretching this over 100 minutes makes for sureme tedium.Do avoid! "}]
