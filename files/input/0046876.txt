[{"Title":"Why we like the Creature.","Date":"4 February 2003","Score":"75 out of 86 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" Today, The Creature From the Black Lagoon is considered a classic. The film itself has become a cliche for the man-in-a-rubber-suit monster movie, and the gillman is now included in the pantheon of classic movie monsters -along with Dracula, Frankenstein, and the Wolfman.I was a teenager when I first saw this Sci-Fi/Horror gem on television in 1965--the film was already ten years old by then--and I loved it. Surprisingly--even after a decade of watching technically sophisticated, state-of-the-art, unbelievably realistic prosthetic, animatronic, and computer-generated movie monsters--today's teenagers still love the old rubber prototype of all swamp monsters -The Creature From the Black Lagoon. This is especially true of teenage boys. Why? Perhaps every adolescent male can relate to the film's star the Creature is horny, inarticulate, moody, misunderstood, not pleasant to look at, and is unbelievably awkward with girls -the ultimate teenage geek. We all remember this classic scene in the movie the film's beautiful heroine (Julie Adams) decides to take a dip, unaware that the Creature is swimming below her. The image is archetypal  the powerful masculine, and the overtly seductive feminine, beautifully juxtaposed in a stylized sexual union. Then, from the murky bottom of his lagoon, the Creature leeringly watches Adams as she performs an erotic underwater ballet, and he knows that, for the moment, he can only look, not touch. (Is the scaly one shy and insecure? Or does he simply have a Catholic upbringing?) Indeed, much of the film's imagery lends itself to Freudian interpretation.OK, so it's not exactly Beauty and the Beast -the Creature's passion is purely primal and elemental. But still, the fact that he restrains himself, satisfying his carnal curiosity with a simple caressing of Julie's ankles, and then retreats back to the gloomy bottom of his underwater sanctum to secretly watch her react in bewilderment, suggests he may be more human than he appears. But, alas, as any good Freudian will tell you, repression often leads to disfunction. And later in the film, in a brief, but beautifully filmed underwater scene, the Creature savagely drags the tantalizing Playboy centerfold down into the Freudian depths to his subterranean grotto -perhaps to hide her under his bed...where his mom can't find her. (I apologize for the metaphor. It's getting stale, I know.)The Creature From the Black Lagoon was directed by Jack Arnold (The Incredible Shrinking Man), who (from 1952 to 1960) directed a series of fantasy/horror films for Universal Studios, including Revenge of the Creature -this film's sequel. Arnold would certainly object to us reading too much symbolism in his gillman, but the Creature may not have achieved such enduring status in monster-mythology if not for the fears and anxieties of the movie-going audience of the '50s. Arnold's dramatic use of the Creature succeeds, of course, by exploiting the human fear of the unseen threat lurking below -a very primal, deeply embedded in the human subconscious, and one that's been ruthlessly exploited by filmmakers in countless horror films. But Arnold's beast may also represent a more intellectualized fear. In the 1950s (and beyond), the threat of nuclear annihilation was very real, and like the creature in Shelly's Frankenstein, Arnold's lagoon creature represents an elemental force of nature that, once discovered and awakened by science (even well-intentioned science), cannot be controlled -perhaps like the newly tapped, but untamed, power of the atom. Or (and this may sound like apostasy in one of John's pretentious, sophistical, over-intellectualized movie reviews, in which I've constantly and digressively wandered into the Freudian morass) perhaps the Creature is not a mataphor for teenage angst, forbidden knowledge, or cold-war anxiety. Perhaps the Creature is nothing more than a guy in a scary rubber suit chasing a pretty girl around a movie soundstage. But where's the fun in that?The Creature From the Black Lagoon is still fun to watch. Actors Richard Carlson (the sophmoric, but noble-minded paleozoologist) and Richard Denning (the ambitious financier) play off each other well. And Julie Adams is simply gorgeous in her custom-made swimsuit. Also, the beautiful (albeit black & white) underwater photography by James C. Haven is appropriately surreal as the men begin their search and descend into the black depths of the lagoon, they intermittently twirl and hover amidst penetrating shafts of sunlight from above; and as the camera pans the peaceful bottom-landscape of the lagoon, the gillman suddenly springs from clouds of disturbed sediment, thrashing through curtains of shimmering air bubbles and drifting weeds, determined and unstoppable in his persuit of the human intruders. But one of the best things about the movie is the music. Some of the themes--written by Henry Mancini and Herman Stein--are quite beautiful; for example, as the expedition slowly makes its way up the dark Amazon, an ensemble of gentle woodwinds can be heard -a soft, subliminal prelude that lets us know we are entering another world, a primeval world. And who can forget the Creature's signature theme--the brassy, bombastic, three-note progression of DA DA DAAAAA!--whenever Creech appeared on the screen?Of course, the best thing in the film is...the Creature. Jack Arnold suggested that the design of the gillman suit be based on the graceful form of the Motion Picture Academy's Oscar statuette. (Really!) The suit was designed and brilliantly crafted by make-up artist Bud Westmore, and there were two versions -one suit for filming on land, and another for filming underwater. On land, the gillman was played by Ben Chapman. Olympic swimmer Ricou Browning wore the gillman suit in the underwater scenes. The dry suit that Chapman wore was beautifully colored with iridescent greens and blues, and mottled with many other marine hues. The wet suit worn by Browning was a bright yellow -the marine hues chosen for the dry suit photographed too dark when filming underwater.Yeah, I really love this movie. I'm not sure why. Perhaps it's just one geek relating to another. You see, in the final reel, neither of us got the girl.

I loved it from the start. I now own the DVD collection and I find all the movies entertaining. The first of the series was, of course, Creature from the Black Lagoon. Richard Carlson, Whit Bissell, Richard Denning, Nestor Paiva and Julia Adams are awesome in their roles. A fossil is discovered of a prehistoric gill-man by a Dr. Maia. He enlists his scientist friend(Carlson) and the research team he works for that is headed by Denning. They travel up a river that ends into an area known as The Black Lagoon. Looking for more fossils, they discover the Gill-Man is alive! The Creature is captured and then escapes but is shot and severely wounded at the end. He sinks toward the bottom of the lagoon but don't worry; he made it back for two more sequels. The team of Jack Arnold(director), William Alland(producer) and Joseph Gershenson(music director, with help from young composer Henry Mancini) help make this film unique. The photography and locales are beautiful. The acting is superb and there is enough action and suspense to keep you at the edge of you seat. This is required viewing for 1950s sci-fi/horror movie fans.

And seen today in standard black and white, the film is quite enjoyable. But it doesn't hold a candle to the original 3-D format, which I was fortunate to see not once but twice during the 1970s and 1980s. Simply stated, BLACK LAGOON's cinematography was probably the best of all 3-D movies to date. As with most 3-D films, there is plenty of coming at you cinematography, and many viewers will be able to pick out such moments when seeing the film in standard black and white--but in addition to these, the film used 3-D in a remarkably subtle way; virtually every scene in the film is designed for 3-D, and the effect is exceptionally memorable in the underwater sequences.I remain disappointed that the 3-D version of BLACK LAGOON--not to mention such other 3-D films as HOUSE OF WAX, IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE, and DIAL M FOR MURDER--has never been released in 3-D format on video or disk; instead, we must make do with such bottom-budget 3-D flicks as THE MASK, CAT WOMEN ON THE MOON, and the like. Admittedly, the impact of the format is lessened by the small screen and demands some careful color adjusting, and the effect requires the use of 3-D glasses--but it is a shame that we must settle for ghosts of the originals when we could easily have the originals instead. In 3-D format, BLACK LAGOON would easily be a ten-star film.Gary F.

Considering that this film is considered a trend-setter, it's amazing how many rules this film BREAKS by today's standards.  It breaks the notion that full shots of the creature and lots of blood and violence are needed to create a scare.  In this film, all you need is a shot of the creature's hand and that piercing three-note musical motive played by brass instruments, and let the imagination fill in the blanks.  It shatters the notion that monsters MUST be computer-generated--a guy in a suit CAN be scary.  And it proves that black-and-white photography can be just as rich  as color photography.  The underwater sequences especially are both beautiful (almost surreal) and eerie at the same time.	And then there is the Gill Man himself.  It's as if the writers took the best qualities of his predecessors and combined them into the last and best (IMHO) of the Universal monsters.  Like The Mummy, he has lived long after he technically should have died; like Frankenstein's monster, he appears to be savage, yet shows intelligence and appreciates beauty; like Dracula, he is seductive.  Just check out the scene where he swims with Julie Adams (unbeknownst to her, of course).  I believe this is why he has achieved the status of a genuine icon, and deservedly so.  Here's hoping he swims the waters for a long time.

It's better made. Just by the title we know there's a monster lurking about. Yet, for the film's first 24 minutes we don't actually see it, only one of its claws. And that holding back of the monster's appearance fosters suspense and mystery. In addition, the film's B&W cinematography is good, for its time, with lots of credible underwater shots. And while the dialogue does contain lots of exposition, the film at least tries to educate viewers.There's nothing complex about the story. A scientific crew heads for the Amazon to do an archaeological dig, after a large fossil is found. The crew ends up at the Black Lagoon, a place of serenity, with its still waters, surrounded by palm trees and the sounds of monkeys and exotic birds. Through much of the film the peaceful setting together with soothing background music actually makes for a rather relaxing movie. Even when we see the monster, it seems lonely and hardly threatening as it glides gracefully through its watery home.I suspect that the film's popularity when it was first released relates to the creature's distinctive appearance, with those moving gills and those bulging dark eyes. And of course, back in those days, the film was made for 3-D viewing, a novelty then that made the monster seem more real. Today, the film has an ever-so-slight environmental theme, given that at least one of the scientists prefers that the monster not be harmed, and given that humans obviously are encroaching into its habitat.Because so much of the plot takes place underwater and therefore lacks dialogue, and given a runtime of only about 78 minutes, there really isn't that much to this movie. But what there is of it is interesting for its historical significance as a precursor to later sci-fi films, and for a monster that's not only photogenic but also alone and arguably lonely in a world that has passed it by, after eons of time.

I think the creature movies from the 30's and 40's were absolutely great, but the 50's have something extra in my humble opinion. The most lovable monster movies were made during this decade and Creature from the Black Lagoon belongs to the absolute top ! My father keeps asking me why I show so much interest in movies that were made before even HE was born. Well...how could you not be in love with this era ??? Every single monster movie from this period gives me the shivers. They're just great. Creature from the Black Lagoon is part of the great Universal collection. It's almost half a century old, but it still hasn't lost a single bit of magic and the impression that it makes on people is still amazing. Like I said...one of the best. Dr. Carl Maia is on a scientific expedition somewhere deep in the jungle, near the Amazone river. He and his team find a fossil of something that appears to be a man-fish. The thing is a hand with gills. To find the rest of this extraordinary body he seeks help and finds it by other respected scientists Dr.David Reed, Dr. Mark Williams and Kay Lawrence. Together the travel to the place where Dr. Maia found the fossil. It seems that his crew got killed and it looks like they're about to find much more than just a fossil ! There still is a living fish-creature living in the legendary Black Lagoon. Soon the scientific expedition changes into a battle to come out alive of the Black Lagoon The location of the Black Lagoon really is one of the most breath-taking settings I've ever seen. The images of the wild, unknown jungle and the horrible noises of the animals makes you feel like your in the jungle yourself. The acting performances are outstanding and there's even a little room for comedy in this film. The character of Lucas ( captain of the ship Rita) breaks the tension from time to time by saying very funny things. The actress who plays Kay is one of the most beautiful woman who ever came on the black and white screen...heck, even the creature seems to think so ! Her name is Julie Adams and she played in a lot of good old-fashioned westerns like The man from the Alamo I recommend you check her out...you won't regret it. The Creature from the Black Lagoon was directed by Jack Arnold. This guy certainly knows what he's doing. He's also the one who gave us Tarantula, another great 50's monster film worth checking out. This film received 2 sequels. I haven't seen the second one ( the Creature walks among us ) but I can surely recommend the first sequel, which was also directed by Arnold. Revenge of the Creature only came out one year after the original and lives up to it. The only think that got lost was the tense atmosphere.

For a small budget Science Fiction/Horror movie of the fifties, this is a great show.  It's well paced, well acted, has great music to accompany the action, and Bud Westmore's Gill Man is a marvel to enjoy.  Originally this was a 3-D movie, and thankfully, it looks so much better in regular flat screen.  I never really did catch the 3-D craze.This is a terrific adventure of Man out of his element fighting a Monster in his element.  The Gill Man is a thinking being, but, still a monster, who remembers the injuries done him by man and seeks retribution.  If the scientists had left him alone, he'd have left them alone. They were the invaders.And, thank goodness that they didn't have a scene of the kidnapped Julia making friends with the now peaceful Gill Man (to show his human side), only to have the heroes show up and kill him.  She was taken as bait to lure the humans into the Gill Man's lair.It spawned two sequels (yes, there were sequels even back then), and both are good in their own right, they just didn't achieve what the original did all the way around.

This discovery can be the the very first link to what turned out to become the human race.Getting an expiation together and going into the uncharted, and undiscovered, Amazon Basin Prof.Maia together with a crew of scientists lead by Dr. Mark Williams, Richard Dennings,get to his campsite. There they find that his two Indian guides were butchered by some strange monster from the deep. It turns out that this creature has been living in the lagoon for millions of years without any contact with the outside world. Now that his domain had been invaded and disturbed he's out for blood and won't stop until all those who trespassed into his kingdom, the Black Lagoon, are eliminated. The Gillman at first is a bit confused of what's happening and just goes out in the water to observe what the humans are doing. When it becomes obvious that their out to get him,dead or alive, and bring him back to civilization, as the scientific find of the century, he goes bananas and sets out to attack and kill everyone on board the science ship Rtia. The Gillman has just one weakness, he gets distracted by the beautiful assistant of Dr. Williams Kay (Julie Adams)whom the Gillman, or creature, wants to keep alive all for himself as a playmate as well as a mate. Even though Dr.Williams wants to go as far as killing the creature the sensitive second-in-command of the expiation Dr. David Reed, Richard Carlson, is dead set against it. Dr. Reed wants to leave the creature alone and just bring back photographic proof that he exists. This causes great friction between the two explorers. The creature meanwhile barricades the Rita into the Black Lagoon by blocking the exit route ,with logs and tree branches. Setting up the movie's finale conflict between man and beast or creature. The creature goes on the attack killing a number of Rita crewmen and almost rips Dr. Thompson's (Whit Bissell), another member of the expiation, face off Later the creature is put to sleep with the underwater knock-out drug Rotenone that Dr. Reed sprays in his face in a tense and deadly underwater encounter. Put in an underwater cage, on the Rita, the creature easily breaks out, after the effects of the drug wears off. Goes back into attack mode the creature has it out in an underwater battle royal with both Dr. Reed and Dr. Williams who he ends up killing. By dragging him down to the bottom of the lagoon and cutting off his air supply.The creature finally gets what he's been after all along, Julie, by boarding the Rita and snatching her up, while everyone else on board is looking the other way. In the end the effects of the Rotenone and a number of spear-gun wounds have taken the wind out of The Gillman, or creature. After taking Julie to his secret hideout or pad, an underground cave, the creature just about had it staggering along the shore, like a drunk, and plopping into the river with David and the crew of the Rita letting him get away. Eye-popping underwater photography makes the movie The Creature from the Black Lagoon one of the best horror films released in the 1950's. The Gillman does return in two more sequels,  Revenge of the Creature in 1955 and The Creature Walks Among Us in 1956, until he was finally put out to pasture, or sea, by the Universal Pictures Studios.

The eponymous creature was played by Ben Chapman on land and Ricou Browning for the underwater scenes. The cinematography is by William E. Snyder and the score is composed by a trio of men, Henry Mancini, Hans J. Salter & Herman Stein. The story sees a scientific expedition at the top end of the Amazon encounter a Devonian Period amphibious creature. As the creature starts to defend its turf by attacking members of the expedition, in fighting begins to take a hold as the men argue about the best course of action to take. Should it be killed, or should it be captured for scientific research? Either way they need to act fast as the creature has taken a fancy to Kay, the sole female member of the expedition group.One of the better creature features that surfaced in the 1950s, Creature from the Black Lagoon was one of the film's made as part of the 3D craze that filtered out of Hollywood in 53 & 54. However, unlike many of those film's that were made in the format over those two years, this one has rightly managed to break away from its gimmicky beginnings to become regarded as a genre classic. There are many reasons why it is still well regarded and taken in appreciatively by newcomers.The story of course is nothing new, the old beauty & the beast theme can be traced back to the daddy himself, King Kong. But much like Kong, Arnold's movie thrives within the endearing story by getting the audience to sympathise with the titular creature. He is after all only defending his territory, he was happy wallowing down in the depths, remaining undiscovered for many a moon. That he is fascinated by the considerable beauty of Kay Lawrence (Adams sexy and gorgeous), is no crime either. The amount of sympathy garnered for Gill-Man is helped enormously by the illogical actions of the humans; who in turn go diving and swimming where legend has it men get eaten! This coupled with their bickering about pro science or trophy hunting makes it easy to side with the amphibious one.It also helps that the film is pretty brisk and only runs for 80 minutes, there's no sags or pointless filler. Too many similar film's of its ilk labour until the monster shows up and all hell then breaks loose. But under Arnold's (It Came From Outer Space/The Incredible Shrinking Man) astute direction, atmosphere and unease is built up by ominous talk and sightings of the Black Lagoon-and only initial glimpses of the creature's scaly webbed claw; accompanied by the attention grabbing theme music. And when the creature finally reveals itself it doesn't disappoint for its an impressive creation. A half-man/half-fish creature covered in scales, resplendent with gills and with cold, dark featureless eyes. It also has great characteristics with a distinctive swimming style in the water, and a lumbering Frankenstein thing going on when on the land. A definitive monster that would be merchandised for ever after.There's also technical accomplishments away from the creature itself, notably with the memorable underwater photography by Snyder, who uses a portable camera to flow with the swimming sequences, while his shadow and light work down in the depths is memorably mood enhancing. The three tiered score is also one of the best to feature in a B movie schlocker, three different composers, three different emotional strands; nice. Then there's of course the definitive sequence, the sexy underwater flirting as Gill-Man swims below the shapely form of Kay, beguiled by her, it's love at first sight. He's not the only one beguiled, we all are, as was Steven Spileberg, who would homage the more dramatic part of the sequence in his opening for Jaws 21 years later. Whilst last but not least it should be mentioned that there are little asides to ecological issues in the piece, something Arnold was want to do. Two sequels would follow, Arnold would return for Revenge Of The Creature in 1955 and then the John Sherwood directed The Creature Walks Among Us would round off the trilogy in 1956.It's the original that still holds up today. 8/10 "},{"Title":"Julie Adams how do you keeping so nice in the jungle?","Date":"20 October 2006","Score":"11 out of 13 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" First the less than serious part That grungy boat sure had a very good powder room, curling iron, and closes iron.

At the end when all hell was breaking lose, she managed to change clothes twice.Now, it is time for the serious part of my review. The true story in this movie is an environmental one. There are two scientists. One of them is trying to preserve Gill-Man while researching him. The other wants to take Gill-Man to the lab at any cost - even the death of the new species. The movie is interesting because of the conflicts between the two men. That is what keeps the story going and keeps the story great. The other part of the storyline is pretty the typical beauty and the beast story. That part is done well too, but I liked the environmental theme aspect better.As for other aspects of this movie, the underwater cinematography is excellent in this movie.

In some ways the structure and feel of the film resembles that of James Whale's version of FRANKENSTEIN where the brooding menace of the monster hangs over the film even though it hasn't been properly introduced .

Richard Denning has an obnoxious character and manages to be just as annoying. And the 3D effects lack sharpness and look rushed and somewhat dated too(look to the Vincent Price version of House of Wax to see how 3D in a horror film could be done well). Despite these flaws, and these are all personal feelings not objective, it is genuinely scary and a lot of fun and regarding monster movies of the 50s-60s it is one of the better ones. The underwater sequences are beautifully shot and very memorable, and the sets and locations have a great deal of atmosphere as well as looking quite exotic. The monster is essentially a man in a suit, you don't care here actually because unlike other monster movies of the era the suit looks great and the monster actually has a personality, managing to be menacing and poignant. The music score fits perfectly, the bombastic monster theme is creepy and not too predictable while at other times the orchestration is nicely understated. The story is simple(and perhaps somewhat by-the-numbers), not too simplistic but easy to follow, but doesn't ever feel ponderous, is suspenseful, has enough in the story and its action to keep entertaining and has a real sense of fun- and legitimate fun rather than guilty pleasure fun- to it. The most memorable and most genuinely scary was the scene with Julia Adams swimming alone with the monster lurking underneath watching her, it is frightening to a kid and adult as it plays on anybody's fear of venturing into the sea and to what is underneath lurking. Steven Spielberg's Jaws also explored this and to even greater and creepier effect. Creature from the Black Lagoon is smoothly directed and has some good characters. The acting has much criticised, but personally it didn't come across as that bad apart from Denning, Julia Adams is the most noteworthy but Richard Carlson is also a competent and likable lead. In conclusion, flawed but fun, has a great monster and has moments that do unsettle, which makes its reputation as a monster movie classic justified. 7/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"Old-fashioned man-in-a-monster-suit fun.","Date":"18 September 2008","Score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" My Take A classic for its day.

Plot concerns a rouge swamp beast (Ricou Browning and Ben Chapman sweating it out in the decent monster suit) who falls for (what else?) a beauty on board a research ship, while the men find good fortune in capturing the beast and saving the gal (whose only real requirement is to scream her heart out). Those who remember stepping into the drive-way while the weird eerie music played on the opening black-and-white titles brings a sudden memory of being a wee bit scared if that rubber monster you now find cheesy so much nowadays.

When members of a previous expedition go missing, Richard Carlson and Richard Denning smell something fishy and lead a new expedition into the Amazon to find out what happened. They discover the Gill Man, a prehistoric link between amphibians and man. The Gill Man has been without a Gill Woman for a darn long time which may account for why he kills everyone he comes in contact with. The Gill Man spots shapely Julia Adams on the ship and recognizes quickly that she has something he needs. She's a babe in a one-piece and Gill Man falls gills over fins for her.

This creature is neither tragic hero, nor unstoppable villain. He's just a living being, a prehistoric half-man, half fish, behaving as his evolution has conditioned him, attacking invaders to his Amazonian paradise, attracted to the female human. The film is full of mind numbing exposition, mediocre acting, low production values and heavy handed staking out of its ethical positions; the humanistic scientist that wants to study and understand the creature versus the base desires of the expedition's financier who wants to kill the thing and bring it back to the world as a trophy. But there are sequence of power and even poetry, as the creature swims silently beneath the team's female scientist (and eye candy). There are moments her that Spielberg would echo in Jaws years later, but here the threat is more eerie and complex than terrifying. And watching the creature pathetically gasp for breath like a fish out of water is a sad and strong image (actually, a lot of the creature's movements, especially under water, are surprisingly convincing as something other than a man in a latex suit).While not, for me, the classic some see it as, it's still a solid cut above the dumb Saturday afternoon entertainment that has lead to our forgetting most of its cinematic cousins, but keeping this creature alive.

Certainly there is much less poetry than in Cocteau's classic, but there is something quite good going on here.First off, there is the lovely young actress Julie Adams. She is ridiculously beautiful in this movie. Ms. Adams had true star potential. That she arrived in the era of television is a shame, because the old Hollywood star system could have made her quite a hot property.I'm always reminded of the reference to this movie in The Seven Year Itch, where Marilyn Monroe's character confesses 'feeling sorry' for the creature. I also had the same feeling.Maybe it's because the creature seems almost noble compared to the dogfight shenanigans of Denning and Carlson. Denning, the antagonist, wants to bring the creature home for a 'trophy'. Apparently, he feels the same way about Julie Adams, even though she is obviously more interested in the Carlson character.But Carlson's character, for all of his goodness, is fairly dull. There's the vague feeling that Julie deserves much better than either of these two lummoxes.Enter the creature (and the nice score by Henry Mancini!) and suddenly there is excitement.And although he severely mangles one of the ship's crew, the creature is ever so gentle with our lovely Julie.Frankly, this movie would not work as well without the presence of Ms. Adams. And the film holds up well these many years later. The creature's make-up remains credible (not laughable as so many old movie monsters can become).I always want to see this movie again....like I said, there's something good going on here.

I love the idea of 3-D movies but haven't had too many opportunities to see them on the big screen. I'm willing to bet that this was quite the theatrical experience in 1954. And for being over 50 years old, the costume is still pretty impressive. Sure it's just a rubber suit, but it's a good looking rubber suit (I love the updated look Stan Winston's crew did for The Monster Squad). The story is rather simplistic. An archaeological dig uncovers the skeletal remains of a creature who may be a missing link in the evolutionary chain from the time when creatures came out of the water to walk upon land. An expedition is led into the heart of the Amazon where the team finds more than they bargained for a living specimen. After a few failed attempts to capture the Gillman, the surviving members decide to flee the area. They might be done with the Creature, but the Creature isn't done with them. He's blocked the only exit from the lagoon and has his eye set on the lovely Julie Adams. It becomes a basic story of survival at that point. Soon after the Gillman struck, the nuclear age came about and it was all about giant spiders and such during the late 50's and 60's. I strongly recommend any creature aficionados catch Creature from the Black Lagoon to see where many classics are strongly rooted.

Dr. Mark Williams, (Richard Denning) who found the claw, agrees to an expedition to find more such pieces of evidence. Tagging along is Dr. Reed's assistant, Kay Lawrence, (Julia Adams) and together with a scientific team, tread into the jungles hoping to find the mysterious Black Lagoon, home of the fabled fossils.

When they find that the creature has a strange attraction to Kay, David and her decide to help get the creature to safety, while the creature terrorizes the men aboard the expedition.The Good News In Universal's stable of monsters, the Creature is one of the most highly-regarded yet oddly not as critically accepted. I think this is one of their better films in their catalog. The Creature is one of the most recognizable faces ever, with the reptilian features, large external gills on the side of the head, and extremely emotive face make him an extremely likable monster. The best shots of the creature are no doubt him underwater, as the creature is simply beautiful to watch underwater. The graceful ease of movement of the monster underwater creates what are the quintessential series of movement and mannerisms that make the Creature so believable. He isn't as threatening as others make him out to be, and instead is a simple being defending his turf. This places him squarely in the King Kong model of beasts, and the similarities don't end there. The men wandering into a forbidden area, is driven by curiosity-turned-greed to capture and extract a remarkable being from its environment, a romance between the species, and a final conflict ensues between meddling man and the instinctive, misplaced animal are also themes common between the two films, and these only make it more endearing to audiences. Rooting for the creature is much easier than rooting for the humans, and that is precisely what the film must place a priority on. It wouldn't be fun to root for the humans in a film like this to wipe out the creature, and to put the audience into league with the monster is a great feat. It moves at a very fast clip, another plus as it's never a taxing watch, yet is pure and simple a popcorn movie in the same context as recent ones. It's never a boring watch. The setting is also quite inventive and unique, with the action taking place in the Amazon. A nice switch from the usual time-period films of the other monster movies, yet also one to allow a spectacular series of shots setting up the gorgeous locations. This is one of the best-looking films in Universal's stables.The Bad News I don't have any real begging complaints about this one.The Final Verdict This is a really great film that I can't find a whole lot wrong with. It's an exciting monster movie from the studio that pretty much invented them, and is one of the better films to come along.

The story revolves around the search for the remainder of a fossil from some sort of gillman that apparently lived in the Devonian era. Of course, the expedition discovers that gillman is still alive and quite capable of wreaking havoc! I thought this lacked a bit of the atmosphere that Universal's earlier stuff had in abundance, but the story was pretty good and, although there were a couple too many speeches from scientist David Reed (played by Richard Carlson) the performances from a largely unfamiliar (to me, although I think I remember seeing Whit Bissell in a Star Trek episode) cast were not bad. Director Jack Arnold did a pretty good job throughout of building suspense (there are a lot of scenes in which you expect something to happen and nothing does.) The whole monster falls for beautiful girl (in this case played by the admittedly lovely Julie Adams) is perhaps a bit cliché in this type of movie, and I did find it passing strange that the creature, who lives in this environment and should be perfectly adapted for it, didn't seem to swim any better than the scientists who were after it!

Whit Bissel, playing Dr. Thompson was believable and Julia Adams, playing Kay Lawrence wasn't bad. Antonio Moreno, playing Carl Maia was so-so. I thought the stunt men and divers playing the creature stole the show. The scene of the clawed hand coming through the tent in the Amazon was phony and so was the clawed hand coming in the porthole of the boat, menacing Dr. Thompson. I counted 12 costume changes for Julia Adams from the time they got to the Amazon to the end of the movie (if you count one being when she took off her top and dove in the water off the boat when they were in the Amazon). The bat in the cave was phony and when the creature picked up David Reed was pretty phony but most of the rest of the work the stunt men did of the creature throughout the film was believable. I thought Henry Mancini did a great job with the music in this film. The scenes of the creature grabbing Mark Williams under the water and dragging him down was very believable and the music by Henry Mancini during this was pretty good. I believed the struggle that the stuntman, playing Mark Williams, made. I've watched this movie probably near 100 times because my girlfriend is in love with it and every time I ask which VCR tape to put in the VCR, she says, Creature from the Black Lagoon or just, The Creature.

Creature from the Black Lagoon is a thrilling movie in 3-D. An enormous amount of time is spent underwater because this was the first time the murky depths had been enhanced by 3-D. Without 3-D, it's just another boring parade of swimmers swimming the creature swimming, Polly Burson and Ginger Stanley swimming, Richard Carlson and Richard Denning swimming. If that sounds uninteresting (and it is&#151;we never even get a good look at either Polly Burson or Ginger Stanley, because both, for obvious reasons, are always filmed in long shots), Creature from the Black Lagoon is bound to disappoint unless Universal decides to dust off those 3-D specs. Even the Creature himself seems far less menacing when viewed flat&#151;thanks not only to the lifelike depth of 3-D but the fact that the film was designed to pass through two filters to reduce the brightness of the image. Only the climactic scenes in the caves (designed specifically for 3-D but still fairly effective flat) and two or three shots when the Creature stalks Julie Adams still come across with any punch. Mind you, Miss Adams is a lovely, lovely girl and she also proves dazzlingly effective in any dimension.Available on DVD through Universal. Quality rating a reluctant ten out of ten. Why reluctant? Well, the image does break up once, but it's not an important sequence. My main complaint is that&#151;for 2-D viewing&#151;the image is too bright. What I would have done (and I'm surprised this didn't occur to the Universal boys) was to print it in sepia. Oh, horrors! I can hear fanatics exclaiming. The original presentations were in black-and-white, not sepia! Wrong, boys! The film itself was processed in black-and-white sure, but the effect, when viewed through the polaroid glasses (and the projection filter) was that it was actually in sepia&#151;and the movie was photographed by both Bill Snyder and Scotty Welbourne with this effect firmly in mind.

The film follows many of the staples of previous Universal offerings, except this time the film doesn't follow an already established story (like the likes of Frankenstein and Dracula did) and the location is a much more important element of the story in this film than it has been in other Universal monster movies. Director Jack Arnold puts us firmly in the Amazon jungle, and all the foliage and animal noises combine to ensure that the action is set firmly where it's supposed to be. This location effects benefits the story immensely, but it also does something more important than that - it represents a triumph over low budget, and that always impresses me. The way that the action is kept mostly in one place helps this too, as it gives the audience the impression that the scope of the film is larger than it really is. Like all good monster movies, the story is thin and easy to follow; and it basically just follows a bunch of explorers/scientists who travel to the Amazon to do research after finding a half-man/half fish fossil.The script and acting in the film are less than brilliant, but by the same standards; aren't bad either and certainly passable for this sort of feature. The creature itself is, of course, the star of the show and it's design is both inventive and even somewhat realistic! Of course, the monster is purely fictional so it would be impossible for it to be truly realistic; but if there was a missing link between man and amphibian, I reckon it would look something like the creature in this movie. The idea of an undiscovered creature coming from the depths of the sea, an area still largely unexplored to this day, is fascinating; and arguably more terrifying than the idea of some unknown entity coming down from space, as the sea is a big part of our own planet. The film doesn't have much in the way of depth and themes, but there is a somewhat muddled comment on the idea of hunting and taking things out of their natural habitat. On the whole; this is an excellent creature feature and one of the best films that Universal ever produced during their golden age. If it's monster movies you want, you could do a hell of a lot worse than this!

Henri Mancini's score, is striking but he would later be known for making the catchiest songs he ever composed, the theme song to The Pink Panther and Inspector Clouseau. I enjoyed it, but does this movie deserve to be remade? No! There is a good reason why. Great movie monsters such as Frankenstein, Dracula, The Wolfman,, The Mummy, and The Phantom of the Opera (not to mention the big guys like King Kong), got remade a few times and I think that they have faced enough abuse to see them exploited and have comical/animated iterations of them.

Guillermo Del Toro said he loved it, but refused to remake it. Great thinking Mr. Del Toro. It has been 60 years, and it is still an iconic classic, that didn't get remade. Bottom line Great creepy creature classic. I highly recommend it. Rated G, but there might be some scenes that are too violent and scary for children under the age of seven. Parental guidance is advised. This has been another Matthew Praises.

Plus as they go deeper, the waters turn much darker. Plus fish are swimming around. Plus the vegetation looks and maybe is real.The Creature is among the best of Universal's creations. The story has the neat element of the Creature being intelligent. Besides being quite aggressive in trying to expel the human intruders, he blockades the craft that has brought these explorers into his back yard. And he wants Julie Adams for his own, shades of Frankenstein wanting a mate. Above water, there is an ongoing squabble between Carlson the pure research scientist who wants the Creature alive and Denning the research financier who wants it dead. The courage of these two men in diving into the unknown waters to hunt for the Creature is exemplary.The name of director Jack Arnold is always a sign of a movie you can count on.

These modern films take their inspiration from 2 seminal classics. One is King Kong, the original 1933 King Kong, not that crap from Peter Jackson. We shall not discuss that one here, but rather the other seminal eco-horror film, 'Creature from the Black Lagoon.' The creature does not venture into the civilized world, dwelling only in the wilderness. He only attacks in response to the desecration of the fossilized body of one of his ancestors, and in response to actual attacks on his physical person. His violence is the natural response to man invading his territory and man trying to capture or kill him. The plot indicates a deep, subconscious understanding on the part of the script-writers that someday man would experience his comeuppance for abusing the natural world.This is a solid, entertaining and fun horror movie, and you can watch it with a 12-year-old without fear that you are damaging the kid for life. It's tight, disciplined, and moves fast with no fluff. The damsel, played by the beauteous July Adams, is quite splendid. If you like B/W horror and monster films, you will find this one very enjoyable, comparable to the original Godzilla in terms of quality.I just saw this film at a revival showing in its original 3-D.

I have not seen the flick in ages, but the charm and polish was still there to considerate one of my all-time favourite Universal monster flicks. Originally, it was distributed in 3-D, but even without that gimmick it stands up marginally well. There's something crisp about these b/w Universal features and Creature from the Black Lagoon is no exception.It's stoutly directed by Jack Arnold with extremely potent cinematography (especially the superbly executed murky underwater shots) and a robust to melodious patchwork music score. Though it's the star of the production were the limelight sticks on. The creature was thought-up through Universal compared to their other monsters that were found through literature. Bud Westmore's astounding rubber design for the beast was vividly crafted and had an imposing figure and personality about it. Rounding off the solid production were credible performances from Richard Carlson, Richard Denning, Antonio Moreno and the simply gorgeous Julie Adams. No wonder why it's love at first sight for the creature! The to-the-point script rounds out the characters and situation they are in a durable manner. A King Kong aspect definitely shapes the premise, Beauty and the Gill-Man. And the leisurely story doesn't lean to far from its traditionally planned framework. In patches streamlining a certain eroticism found in some sequences breaks this mould. Director Arnold kicks away from sophistication to rally up genuinely compact suspense and an atmospheric air from its surroundings and natural sounds. It does have that uplifting feel of the scientists being out of their comfort zone, and we the audience acknowledge it too.One of the best monster flicks of the 50's era.

Some of those changes are within minutes of each scene that take place withing the same time frame give or take an hour in context. Even as the men around her are mutilated and massacred, the lovely Kay doesn't let that detract her from a quick outfit change, LOL.

I also remember seeing it on TV, and I have to say the experience is very different. It's still a good monster movie if you see it on television (or home video), but there's something about the large screen and the 3-D glasses that really gives it that extra jazz. I found it amazing that this movie from 1956 managed to entertain an audience made up of mostly 20-to-30-somethings. The entire audience applauded wildly when it was over, something I never see at the movies anymore.Sure the film is badly dated and more than a little campy, especially the opening narration that brings together theories of creationism and evolution in an awkward crash-course in the beginnings of the planet. But once the action gets going, you really start to lose yourself in the weird world of the film. Absolutely none of it takes place in surroundings that are familiar to the average moviegoer. The early scenes take place under the ocean and in an aquarium observatory full of large fish (sharks?). Then the action shifts immediately to the exotic locale of the Amazon (heh heh). The scenery is outstanding, and I was really impressed with the slow approach of the camera as it glides over the very still water of the titular lagoon. I had to wonder what Kay was smoking that made her want to jump into that water and frolic around.Once the characters are onto the fact that they're in deep water with the gill man, the real fun starts. There are a lot of hoary monster movie clichés, including some funny stuff as the creature reaches its hand inexplicably out of the water to feel up...the riverside? In between monster attacks, there's a lot of humor, both intentional and otherwise. The audience I saw it with was quick to pick up on the sexual tension between David and Mark (!), and the character of Lucas delivers some amusingly memorable lines.But it's not all jokey, either. The underwater photography is truly exciting, especially in 3-D. For some reason I was taken by the part where David and Mark descend into the lagoon to collect rock samples from along the bottom. Just the idea of them swimming down there into unknown waters was really creepy, with or without the creature. The creature costume itself is great, too; I loved the scenes of him lurking in the plants along the bottom of the lagoon.If you get the chance to see Creature in a theater, in 3-D, then by all means don't miss out on it.

Originally produced in 3-D, The Creature From The Black Lagoon (1954) arguably represents the American Monster Movie of the 50s more than any other film, and may be referred to as the last of the true Universal Horror Classics. Though I would not personally rate it as en par with Universal's absolute greatest Horror films such Frankenstein (1932), Bride of Frankenstein (1935), The Invisible Man (1933) or The Mummy (1932), this film is also an absolute must-see for any motion picture lover, which once again presents a tragic monster.With this film and its eponymous monster, Arnold created a cinematically new kind of monster. Though the great H. P. Lovecraft is not credited, his brilliant works about ghastly fish-people definitely served as an inspiration. Universal Horror films always were forerunners in terms of effects, and this one is no exception. Especially the underwater sequences are absolutely astounding, and the monster-costume is awesome.After an ancient fossil which might explain the evolutionary link between sea- and land-creatures is found in the Amazon jungle, a bunch of scientists including Dr. David Reed (Richard Carlson) and his beautiful young fiancée Kay Lawrence (Julie Adams) go on an expedition into unexplored territory. In spite of warnings from locals, they enter a part of the Amazon from which no one has yet come back alive, and soon are confronted with a creature beyond their imagination... The eponymous creature is a classical example for the tragic monster. Though deadly, the creature is not terribly malignant, especially since the humans are the ones that are invading its habitat. The scientists' behavior is actually quite an interesting time-document at times (I simply cannot imagine any scientist throwing cigarette stubs into the unpolluted Amazon in a present day feature). The monster looks cool, and the costume is very-well animated. Though not particularly scary, the film is very tense and suspenseful. Julie Adams is drop-dead gorgeous, and I have full understanding for the creature's falling in love with her.Creature from the Black Lagoon is an essential Monster Movie Classic that shouldn't be missed by any lover of cinema. I have read that famous Swedish director Ingmar Bergmann loved the film so much that, after first seeing it, he would watch it on every single one of his birthdays. A remake is due in 2011, which of course is gonna suck as all the crappy remakes of classic Horror films that we are being annoyed with these days.

Escalante, Ricou Browning, Ben Chapman, Sidney Mason, Rodd Redwing....Director Jack Arnold, Screenplay Harry Essex, Arthur A. Ross, Maurice Zimm.Universal Pictures, the studio behind the great horror classics like Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy and The Wolf Man, were still at the height of their success when they released their Creature trilogy, beginning with Creature From The Black Lagoon. In 1954, cinema was the new wave of entertainment and people left their homes and TV to escape into the movies. As a bonus, many of the more over-the-top sci-fi films were in 3-D, allowing audiences to really feel the action. And so audiences came to now the Gill-Man, a half-man, half-aquatic creature that became an icon of classic 50's drive-in horror movies. Directed by Jack Arnold, the film takes place in South America, on an unidentified lake simply known as the Black Lagoon in the Amazon River. A team of marine biologists and fossil-finders are in search of new forms of aquatic life but little do they know the horror that await them. Richard Carlson portrays David Reed, the head scientist, Julie Adams portrays his beautiful wife Kay, Richad Denning portrays fellow biologist Mark Williams, Antonio Moreno as Dr. Carl Maia and Nestor Paiva as their Spanish guide Lucas who tells them of the legendary Gill Man. The Gill Man is the last of its kind, a prehistoric creature still lurking in the river. The legend becomes all too real when they find themselves in the mercy of the Gill Man (portrayed by Ben Chapman and Ricou Browning in costumes for the land sequences and underwater sequences). A human touch can be seen in the scaly monster's eyes and body and even more when his voyeuristic tendencies take over. He spies on the swimmers and scuba-divers and falls for the beautiful Kay when she goes swimming alone. They attempt to capture the creature and sedate him but he goes on a murderous rampage before he is finally vanquished. Or is he ? Besides the exciting adventure plot, there is also the gorgeous cinematography by William E. Snyder. Filmed in the beautiful river wildlife of Florida, you'd hardly know it. Then there's the Creature himself, long associated with American horror cinema just as much as Frankenstein. Behind all the sci-fi and horror, there is a sense of poignancy to the tragic tale of a nearly extinct creature who is, after all, part human, seeking to understand the human world but belonging to the savage world of pre-historic man. This was the first film in the series. Revenge of the Creature and The Creature Walks Among Us were filmed in a hurry and released in 1955 and 1956 using different actors but same location and same formula. This first installment is the greatest of the three, with a terrific script, fine acting for this kind of film and not to mention dramatic almost dissonant Stravinsky like music by an uncredited Henry Mancini early in his career as well as Hans J. Salter and Herman Stein. Sit back, grab some popcorn and get ready for one of the all-time greatest horror classics from the 1950's, a decade full of horror/sci-fi film in 3-D.

Adams takes a swim in the AMAZON????); the movie was shot in 3-D...and it shows (countless scenes of the spear gun pointing at the audience).The good things  beautiful atmosphere; great music score; incredible underwater photography and an impressive creature. Also it is short (79 minutes) and really kicks into high gear during the end.This is now considered the best 1950s monster film--but I can't agree.  I did see it in 3-D in the early 1980s and I remember being very impressed then.  So, maybe with the 3-D it works better.  Still, worth catching.  I'm giving it a 7.

Plot and characterizations are pretty basic (Julia Adams' heroine is a soppy wimp who screams at the slightest provocation and is barely able to function under duress without the presence of fiancé Richard Carlson), but the technical credits are superb, and Arnold pulls off more than a few classic set-pieces, notably the iconic sequence when Adams takes a swim in the lagoon and her movements are mirrored by the creature as it rises from the depths. Viewers are urged to seek out the original 3-D print, a masterpiece of dimensional photography and composition, especially the underwater sequences (supervised by Charles S. Welbourne), where characters appear to be suspended in vast spaces deep within the frame. Followed by REVENGE OF THE CREATURE (1955), also in 3-D.NB. Though photographed in Universal's dual-strip process, the movie was exhibited theatrically in single-strip Pola-Lite format, with the left-right images configured side by side on the 35mm film, vertically aligned, creating a 1.661 aspect ratio.

My personal favorite monster of all time though has to be Godzilla the true king. But because of Godzilla I've been introduced especially more recently to a lot of other older monster movies including this one. I just watched this movie for the first time about a week ago with some of my family and as I'd expected I was really the only one who liked it which is pretty understandable. I mean these kinds of movies are definitely not for everyone and are really more of an acquired taste I think. I really don't have a whole lot to say so I'll be keeping this review pretty short.First off as far as cheesy monster movies go the acting in this movie was pretty good. Everyone played there parts well and did what they needed to do to make this an entertaining movie with a bit of heart. The set designs were all pretty good looking (for the time anyway). In particular I liked the scenes that took place inside the caves. The effects were of course terrible by todays standards but thats fine with me. The creature still looked interesting though at the same time pretty ridiculous to me at least but again thats just because here in 2014 I'm used to better effects so that sort of thing in no way took away from the movie. The creatures design is very interesting and unique looking at least compared to other monsters that I have seen.The plot is simple but more than enough to keep you entertained. A group of scientists discover a strange creature and it begins killing them off one by one. The creature takes a page from King Kongs book and falls for a good looking girl who is just kind of along for the ride. Which is something I always thought was weird because I just feel like a monster like Kong or the creature from this movie falling for a human is like if a human went to the zoo to pick out a lover but thats just me.

But if the Mole Men are largely forgotten today you sure can't say that about our friend from beneath the waters.

One might be that he crawled out of the Primordial Ooze and also shares Human Physiology. This is a quiet Monster Movie. There is much going on here that is essentially an Underwater World that seems to anticipate Walks in Space. Man's reach for the Stars and the analogy of undiscovered depths right here on good old Earth is mentioned a couple of times.It is a Romantically rich Film that tugs at the Heart. A combination of subtlety and terror that is never heavy handed. A welcome change of pace from most of the eras Fright-Films.

Nosferatu and other fair starring Lon Chaney, Sr, were some of the earliest mysteries, suspense, and horror films. But unlike the movie-musicals and romantic dramas which launched the talkies in the 1930's, genre films have often been relegated to B Picture status, and each decade has seen its offerings of whatever genre caught audience's fancies. The 1930's was the era of the gangster film and the horror film, a la Public Enemy, Little Caesar, Dracula and the Mummy, the 1940's was the era of film noir thrillers, such as Double Indemnity and The Postman Always Rings Twice, and the 1950's was the era of the movie monster. In the 1950's, movie monsters splashed upon drive-in theaters reigned in which the monster itself was the star of the show, inspired by the first bona fide King Kong feature released in 1933. Them, which starred giant Ants, Tarantula starring a giant spider, and the biggest of them all, Godzilla, a freak of atomic science creating a reptilian creature the size of Mt Everest, caused many a female movie goer to clutch their date in rapturous fright.One of the better installments from the movie monster era is Creature from the Black Lagoon. Despite the rather predictable dialog and cookie-cutter characters, Creature is still a decent viewing, for reasons other than the masterful script which, in certain scenes, almost rings of screen writing nearing the genius threshold of Plan 9 from Outer Space. However, what saves Creature is the creature itself and the plot if you're willing to suspend your 21st-century movie-going sensibility for about 90 minutes.The story begins with the discovery of an ancient fossil, a claw no less, surviving from several million years ago. Unlike most fossils, the claw appears to be both man-like and amphibious. A strange missing link between humans and frogs, I guess. An unlikely entourage of scientists, three male and one female, decide to survey the Amazon for more fossils on small expedition boat. Of course two of the male scientists have the hots for the one female, a manage a trois which isn't quite as romantic as King Arthur, Guinevere and Sir Lancelot. The lucky boy who currently has the girl exhibits the desirable trait of being the only voice of reason when the Amazon Lagoon may be their last stop. The other male, the female's former lover who got dumped a few years back, is as hot-headed and uncompromising as an oven set to 425-degrees. The female is supposed to be a scientist too, although her reason d'etre is more about her skimpy outfits than intellectual discourse and contribution, which is so typical of these genre films.Instead of finding more fossils, the team is invaded by a living example of the amphibious man creature. The love triangle between the scientists becomes a love rectangle two men, one woman, and one creature. What saves the film from becoming ridiculous farce is the monster himself, who, in retrospect, has much more character than any of the other males, except for possibly the Latin American captain of the expedition boat. The monster's motives are a bit typical grab anything that looks human with his man-crunching claws. And in later scenes, his presence allows our only female character to engage her vocal chords which, in retrospective, are designed to indicate the very complex and subtle emotions often associated with terror.The best aspect of Creature aside from the creature himself are the superb underwater sequences. When the rival males decide to battle the Creature, instead of each other, they take their gear underwater. The creature glides easily through the lagoon, making him a very believable amphibious creature. My understanding is the creature was played by a professional swimmer in the underwater scenes. Scenes on land and on the boat were another actor.All things considered, a fine 1950's low budget horror flick which may have lost some of its punch over the years but not its charm. The dialog is campy; one of my fav's is We didn't come here to fight monsters, we're not equipped for it. The young lovers squabble over who gets the girl and the scientific fame like junior high kids arguing over who gets to play quarterback. But the monster is still quite a site, constantly opening his strange mouth to breathe when he's on land. And this film inspired many later films with better scripts and bigger budgets like Alien and Jurrasic Park. The film has continued to be part of American b-movie culture with the creature making cameo appearances such as in Marvel comics and the Simpsons. A must-see for horror movie buffs.

Besides its age, the film was shot in B&W, which is a huge turn-off to me, simply because color has a way of making pictures come ALIVE, no matter the age.I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the film holds up quite well. I thought the creature itself was going to look like a guy in a lame rubber suit, but that's not the case. It's clear that the filmmakers put a lot of effort into the appearance of the creature and the way it gasps for air, swims, walks, etc. In other words, there's a reason why the Gill-man is so iconic.It's easy to sympathize with the creature,as David Reed (Richard Carlson) does at the very end, since the Gill-man's just existing in its native turf. In other words, the humans are the invaders here. So, we can understand the creature's hostile reaction, killing many, and we can also understand why it hesitates to harm Kay (Julia Adams) and, indeed, wants to take her back to his grotto! Why? Because Julia Adams is totally gorgeous in the film! In fact, it's well worth catching just for her as she fills out those short white shorts perfectly, lol! There are some quality underwater scenes shot in Wakulla Springs, Florida, particularly when the creature swims underneath Kay unbeknownst to her, symbolizing sexual union. The rest of the film was shot at Rice Creek, Florida, and Universal City, California.FINAL WORD Although understandably dated, The Creature from the Black Lagoon stands the test of time.

The creature is one of the best looking monster-suits of its day and it still looks great; the music is good; the underwater scenes were probably mind-blowing back in the day and still are; the theme of science vs big game hunter is great; the camera work is superb; the ending is sad but we are not sure why...what a brilliant film! Part of the fun is to watch for the wonderful monster movie genre conventions of the 50s as the film unfolds. One of these conventions is that someone remarks that the hero or heroine looks too young or attractive to be a scientist (watch for it twice in this film). Another convention is the respect and awe given to science and scientists, and the necessity of explaining and understanding any creature in scientific terms (usually combined with some really wacky notions). Probably the most fun convention is that the very top of the social pecking order is occupied by young, hunky, testosterone-intoxicated scientist men - the alpha males.On the surface, the plot is about a scientific discovery of a creature living in a remote area of the amazon, and what to do about this discovery. The main subplot of the story, which ends up almost taking over the surface story, is about Kay choosing between two men. Both are alpha male scientists, but one (Mark) is wealthy and successful the other (David) is dedicated and scientific. Because there are subtle relationships between these three people and the creature, the film ventures into deeper waters (so to speak) than most simple monster films.I like to think of Kay Lawrence (Julie Adams) as the main character of the movie. Yes I know that the guys get all the macho lines, do all the hero things, solve all the problems, while Kay may at first glance appear to do little but scream and faint and look pretty. But on closer examination Kay is shown to be independent, intelligent, adventurous and courageous. She is more fun, forward-looking, alive and human than either of the two alpha males. Kay dominates the camera shots too, which indicates the pivotal nature of her role. Note that in each scene, who Kay stands next to, and where she is placed in relation to the others is always important within the subtext of the story. The two alpha males don't quite behave as most alpha males of the genre. Usually, the alpha male is unambiguous and aggressive (if not predatory) toward the female. Here however, we have one male bitter and obsessed while the other is oblivious and dedicated. The males are more interested in competing with each other than winning Kay (watch how often the two men are paired in shots, but listen to their dialog as well). In most movies of this genre, the woman is decisive in choosing a mate. Here, because the two males are inaccessible, Kay's choice is necessarily ambivalent, and great complications develop as a result. In the end, Kay ends up with one of the alpha males, but it seems to me she is left with a socially acceptable but emotionally unsatisfying partner. It feels like she deserved better. Hollywood fell in love with Freudian psychoanalysis sometime around the 50s. This can be seen in many films where subconscious evils become physical monsters (Forbidden Planet is an example). This theme is used, if somewhat loosely, in the Creature From the Black Lagoon. Once the adventurers enter the Black Lagoon area, the creature can be interpreted psychologically as Mark's monstrous shadow, or double. Mark is embittered by Kay's rejection of him, he is murderous enough to kill for her (watch for the first appearance of the spear gun), but instead he tries to kill the beast (his lust for her), but is himself killed and the beast triumphs (lust wins over rational ego), so the beast attains full freedom to seize the girl (Kay is abducted only after Mark is killed). The film shows us what happens when two alpha males fight for dominance and the woman does not, or cannot, fully connect with one of them. Kay's hesitation to fully ditch Mark is what brings out the creature. At critical junctures Kay sympathizes with Mark, and the creature immediately appears. This is seen on the boat after the men return from their first dive - Kay expresses sympathy for Mark, but Dave is concerned that Mark might try to take her away from him (note how for David the focus is always on competition between he and Mark). After this scene, Kay goes for her famous swim and encounters the creature.Then at night, after the creature is captured, Kay has a bizarre conversation (in which science attempts to arbitrate love!) with Dr. Thompson about the growing tension between Mark and Dave.He says, Once you admit the simple fact that you are in love, which you have, then it becomes good idea to be the scientist about it. She replies, It's not as easy as you think and goes on to explain how she owes her success and her job to Mark. Right on cue, the creature breaks free and attacks. Again we have sympathy for Mark followed by an appearance of the creature.There are more points to be made about this love triangle + creature, but they remain beyond the scope of this review. Next time you watch Creature From the Black Lagoon, try seeing it from the perspective of Kay as the main character, and the creature as the dark side of Mark's passion. You might be rewarded with fresh insights, and an enriched enjoyment of an old favorite.

Thanks are mostly due to it's director, the craftsmen who worked on the title creature and the charms of leading lady Adams. Deep in the Amazon, researchers find a fossilized claw that leads to an expedition up river to The Black Lagoon in order to locate any other remains. What they find, however, is a living example of the species and he isn't particularly pleased to have been discovered! One scientist, Carlson, wants to pretty much leave the creature alone and just study it and collect more information from the area. Another one, Denning, wants to capture it and bring it back to the US for experimentation and exhibition. Once the creature lays eyes on Adams, what the men want no longer matters as he begins to attack anyone who gets in the way of his courtship. The film (originally presented in 3-D, which doubtlessly enhanced all the shots of his claw coming out from behind rocks and other various items coming towards the camera) is almost quaint when compared to the slice-and-dice flicks that have come about in the half century since its release. It's more fun than scary, yet there remains some suspense and it's enjoyable viewing no matter what (and the first underwater encounter is still creepy as the Gill Man appears against some rocks and then juts out.) Carlson and Denning are both bland in their roles, though Denning, as the nastier of the two, gets a little more to work with. Adams is gorgeous and gives a performance that is surprisingly natural in that era of intense artifice. Somehow the film manages to be both campy and serious, schlocky and high grade all at the same time. The Gill Man's suit is a remarkable creation and the swimmer inside gets surprising mobility and speed going. It is ridiculous, however, when the humans are able to out-swim him. It's not possible for a man with a tank, face mask and flippers on to out-paddle a creature who lives underwater! The view of the scientists is fascinatingly bizarre. They explore this completely untouched area of the world and proceed to flick cigarette butts into the river and then poison the water, bringing scores of dead fish to the surface! Also, Adams hilariously changes clothes for every scene, apparently inspiring Ginger Grant from Gilligan's Island to make sure that no boat trip occurs without a steamer trunk of apparel. (Look for the scene in which Adams' ponytail wraps around one of the ropes on deck!) By the time she does an Esther Williams routine (in the Amazon River?!), as lovely as she is, the camp factor is in full swing. Other unintentional laughs occur when Denning and Carlson are duking it out below deck while a fully bandaged Bissell lies on a bunk, powerless to point out that the creature's hand is making it's way through an open porthole! Still, enough skill exists in the film to overcome most of the goofy aspects. The music cue that blares almost every time the creature appears is at once amusing, yet startling, and thoroughly memorable. It's odd to say that a horror film is pleasant, but that's just what this is. It's short, compelling, fun, captivating and endearing.

It demonstrates much less of Arnold's poetic style than his other films (especially `The Space Children', Arnold's personal favorite).  But the creature itself is one of the screen's most effective full-body monster suits, designed by two ace make-up men, Bud Westmore and Jack Kevan.Richard Carlson (`It Came from Outer Space') is the star, Richard Denning (`The Black Scorpion') co-stars, and gorgeous Julie Adams provides the cringing heroine in the bathing suit.  William Alland handled production chores, and Hans Salter composed the famous and effective blaring-trumpet musical score.  Swimming champ Ricou Browning wore the creature suit in the underwater scenes (which he also directed),  and Ben Chapman played the creature on land.  Whit Bissell  (`The Time Machine') plays the bandaged scientist whom the creature malls.  Filmed in 3-D because of the success of `It Came from Outer Space', the previous year.   Screenplay by Harry Essex and Author Ross.The movie was successful enough to inspire two sequels (`Revenge of the Creature' and `The Creature Walks Among Us').  Today, `The Creature from the Black Lagoon' is equated with the great horror classics from the 1940s such as `Frankenstein' and `The Wolf Man'.

So he goes after one; so he runs off with a girl (he is a gill man isn't he?). He didn't start it. When I was young I saw this for the first time in a regular old fashioned movie theater. The suspense and terror were wonderful. Even though you can see the SCUBA tank on the back of the creature under his costume, the fact was that he was always lurking somewhere. Like so many poor souls, he is destroyed for doing what comes naturally. I always wonder about these sorts of creatures.Did they have mother or a father? Where else would he come from? What happened to them. Was he loved? We will never know because he never got a chance to defend himself. I look at this film as a classic of its type and I'm glad someone made it, even though it stands the test of time less well than others. I may comment later on the sequels which are pretty bad.

Now I see it again and am struck by how simple and crude it is by modern film-making standards. I am also struck by how callous the scientists are portrayed.The story is set up well. A scientist displays a hand and a team goes back to the Amazon to find additional relics of this prehistoric creature. There is a decent discussion about arrested evolution and the possibility that this creature might still be alive. Digging in rocks turns up nothing, so they hire a boat to take them down a tributary to a lagoon where they surmise artifacts might have been carried by erosion over the eons.Diving, they don't find artifacts, but encounter the creature himself.  We know it is a he because of his attraction to the lady swimming above him, and lesbianism had not been invented yet. He obviously is lonesome, not having seen a woman in thousands of years, so he is intent on carrying her away and both living happily ever after. Sort of like an underwater Tarzan.Unfortunately the divers don't understand this, and they want to capture the creature and bring him back for study. So they get this bright idea of spreading rotenone in the water, hoping for him to float to the surface like fish do.  But the creature doesn't. So they shoot him with spear guns, and later with rifles until he staggers into the water and is shown sinking, motionless, presumably dead. However, there was a sequel which I didn't see, so maybe he survived.The lady, played by Julia Adams, was along just for creating romantic tension on the expedition, and later for the attraction of the creature. She was 28, and quite attractive. She later had a full TV career as Julie Adams. The underwater scenes were shot in various clear water springs in Florida. Two different actors played the creature - one for underwater and another for those out of the water. Black and white, marginal sound, just OK acting, still a fun watch because of its historical film significance. This was pretty scary stuff back in the mid-50s, before space travel, Star Wars, Alien, and other movies with strange and often scary creatures.

The underwater photography posed a big challenge along with the creation of a full functioning creature with underwater acting capability.  It was obvious that the creature was an actor in costume, but the retrofit for concealable scuba gear was a huge challenge!        The underwater filmwork was all black and white, which for the most part, was more simple than the color filming, which had not been perfected at the time.      There is a lot to appreciate in this film for those two items (creature & filmwork) alone, since today, we rarely see either an actor costumed for underwater acting, or filming for long segments or sequences underwater.  Most films in these categories today are special effects, mechanical creatures, and some shorter segments and scenes that barely do the job.....very lame when compared to Creature from the Black Lagoon.  The Gillman creature was very original and artistic.       The acting and directing on this film was very well done, and carried the viewer through the drama.        Wakula Springs, now a state park, was host to other films including Tarzan with Johnny Weismuller.

The brilliance of the Creature's conception goes beyond the grace of Ricou Browning's underwater performance to the elements of his predecessors that he combines.  Like the Mummy, he has lived long ages beyond his time, is immensely old and alone; like Frankenstein's Monster, he seems to be a savage brute, yet shows gleams of intelligence and the appreciation of beauty; like Dracula, he is an abductor and seducer, who craves human company for inhuman reasons. Yet at the same time he's unique, as alien as any space creature, a mystery from the deep. Giger's elegant Alien and Sil (Species) are surely his descendants. And he's darn scary too! with his unpredictable temper and long razor claws. All this resonance plus a creepy, lyrical river journey into deep mysterious jungle, gorgeous black and white photography (including Haven's glowing underwater work), Julia Adams' beauty, Richard Carlson's square-jawed scientific integrity, and Antonio Moreno's entertaining character turn as the stout captain of the RITA.

Creature from the Black Lagoon is one of the best-known examples from the fifties. It was filmed in 3-D, one of a number of such films produced during the brief 3-D craze of 1952-54. The plot is a simple one. A group of scientists are taking part in a fossil-hunting expedition to the Amazon jungle. While there they are menaced by an amphibian humanoid creature. Several members of the expedition are killed by the creature and the only female member, Kay Lawrence, is abducted. (Many critter movies, most famously King Kong, were based on the assumption that monstrous creatures are romantically or sexually attracted to human females, especially young and beautiful ones). Of course, Kay's fiancé David has to be on hand to save the day. This film has become something of a cult movie, although it is admittedly no classic. Its main fault is that it takes itself too seriously. To modern audiences, looking back at the fifties though spectacles tinted by twenty-first century postmodern irony, its over- the-top style can look very much like a deliberately camp and cheesy affectation for the sake of comedy, but I suspect that in 1954 we were all supposed to take this sort of thing at face value. Although the film is not otherwise religious in tone, it opens with the Biblical line In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth, and to film- makers from the fifties taking the name of the Deity in vain for the sake of cheap laughs would have seemed uncomfortably close to blasphemy. The opening section of the film is a brief (and none too accurate) lecture on the geological history of the Earth and the evolution of life. (The scriptwriters could have done with a bit more information on these subjects, otherwise they might have avoided the embarrassing goof of having a supposedly expert palaeontologist suggest of a fossil from a Devonian rock formation that it might be a Pleistocene man. Only some 350 million years out, but what's 350 million years between friends?). The film's musical score is exaggeratedly dramatic and portentous, as is most of the acting, with the most banal lines being spoken in a tone of voice more appropriate for a recitation of a Shakespearean soliloquy or the Gettysburg Address. The monster is reasonably convincing during the underwater scenes, but on land he is all too obviously a man in a rubber suit. And yet the film has some good points which raise it above the level of most critter movies of this period. Despite the over-dramatic style of acting, the characterisation goes deeper than in most films of this type. Admittedly, the lovely Julie Adams as Kay has little to do beyond what is normally expected of the heroine of a critter movie, namely to stand around looking sexy in a swimsuit or pair of minuscule shorts, to scream loudly whenever the script requires her to and to be rescued at the end by her handsome, hunky boyfriend. Some of the characters, however, are more developed, such as Lucas, the crusty old captain of the steamer on which the expedition is travelling, and the expedition's leader, Dr. Mark Williams. Williams is in some way an unsympathetic character, willing to put his colleagues' lives at risk in his quest for scientific glory, but he does finally redeem himself. Even the monster is made more sympathetic than the average critter, with a suggestion that the humans are as much to blame for the fatal confrontation as it is, and that it only kills in self-defence.Many critter films have become famous simply for being bad. There are too many to list them all, but any film buff will have his or her favourite so bad it's funny example; mine is the British-made The Blood Beast Terror from the sixties, a prime candidate for any list of the worst films ever made. Creature from the Black Lagoon, however, is a cut above that category, a critter movie one can watch for reasons other than the desire to laugh at it. 5/10 "},{"Title":"Decent but falls short of being a classic","Date":"31 October 2011","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" This slightly repetitive film will always have its fans - it probably works best in the original 3D - but once the creature is unleashed it becomes a fairly pedestrian affair, with good underwater photography but not much plot.The story concerns a scientific expedition's investigation of the Amazonian Black Lagoon of the title.

Richard Carlson, dependable as ever, is soon confronted with this Devonian survival - a six foot Gill-Man of fantastic strength and murderous intent.

As they travel deeper into the Amazon, they disturb the titular creature (variously Ben Chapman and Ricou Browning), who takes vengeance on the invading scientists.The film is most memorable for its exquisite underwater scenes, which equal parts haunting and horrific. The scene in which Kay swims in the lagoon (mirrored, unbeknownst to her, by the Gill Man beneath the water's surface) is beautifully balletic. Contemporary audiences will be struck by its similarity to the scene in WALL-E where WALL-E and EVE engage in a stunningly-executed space-set dance. It is easily the most memorable moment in the film, which brilliantly captures the creature's fascination with the engaging beauty of Julia Adams.The Creature is himself reasonably realistic-looking. Assisted by the lagoon's enshrouding flora and aquatic shadows, the Gill Man appears shockingly otherworldly (despite the film's very rational explanation for his existence). The moments where The Creature is half-surfaced (or, if you'd prefer, half-submerged) are when The Creature is most striking - both frighteningly alien and deeply sympathetic.For its numerous positive qualities, the film is sadly very average. The acting, directing and writing are all rather utilitarian, never touching on the excellence or originality of other classic monster movies (such as 1922's Nosferatu, 1931's Dracula, Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, 1932's The Mummy, 1933's The Invisible Mane and 1941's The Wolf Man). It is certainly worthwhile, but hardly more than merely noteworthy.

The script by Harry Essex & Arthur A. Ross certainly moves along at a nice pace & at only just over 70 minutes in length it moves along briskly, however the script still manages to paint some decent if a bit clichéd character's with everyone coming across like they should, for instance there's the misguided one who wants to take the monster back to civilisation at any cost & then there's the hero who saves the day & manages to do what's 'right'. Of course no-one is going to sit down & watch this for it's character's, dialogue or deep storyline are they? No, we want to see the creature from the black lagoon itself & in this respect the film doesn't disappoint. The monster itself is rather good & even somewhat credible, well as much as it can be, & to start off with we just get to see it's clawed webbed hand but when it does finally appear it's quite a neat monster. It does the usual monster things like fall in love with the pretty girl, kill whoever gets in it's way & generally causes problems for everyone. The script makes good use of the monster & at giving it a human quality that tries to make the audience feel some sympathy for it without overdoing it & overall I thought it was an enjoyable monster film the likes of which they don't make anymore.Director Arnold does OK, everything is kept within the realms of possibility & he resists going overboard to create a nice tight little tale of mismatched love. Originally shot & shown in 3-D the DVD I just watched was definitely presented flat so I don't know if there is any opportunity to watch this how it was intended but I think it would have been interesting to see how it used the effect as nothing stood out as being 3-D apart from a scene when he monster sticks it's hand through a port hole & tries to 'grab' the audience. The black and white photography is good especially some of the underwater scenes which are well shot. The special effects are good & the monster suit is surprisingly pretty impressive, I've seen a lot worse in much more recent films that's for sure.Technically Creature from the Black Lagoon is well made although don't expect the big budget production value's & special effect of more recent Hollywood productions, you have to remember this was made over 50 years ago. The acting is decent & better than the usual stiffness from casts of this period who appeared in this sort of horror/monster film.Creature from the Black Lagoon is now considered a solid gold classic, while I won't say that I think it's the best film ever made it certainly still deserves to be seen & available & hopefully the recent DVD will keep it alive, I liked it & I think it's well worth a watch.

The Creature resides in the Amazon waters; he's smart enough to consistently outwit a group of scientists and crew members on-board a vessel (he climbs aboard ship without being noticed several times!) and is powerful enough to rip through a fishing net, yet he's rather pathetic with his fish-mouth half-open and his webbed hands held out in front of him like a sleepwalker. This Creature seems rather docile...so where does his rage and strength come from? The plot takes on a who-will-be-killed-next? theme, which is fine, but the Creature's attraction for Julia Adams is a puzzler (sure, she looks good in her bathing suit, but does he really have the sexual drive of a human male?). As the leader of the expedition, Richard Carlson gets all the hoary speeches about science versus greed, though he and Adams both look good soaking wet. For a low-budget monster movie, the photography is surprisingly good and there are some nicely staged, scary sequences, always underlined by melodramatic fright music. The grotto where the Creature presumably spends much of his time is a curio (the characters always enter underwater, yet they exit by foot on land) and the macho vying for the woman is dumbly amusing (she doesn't seem to mind). A tighter, smarter script might have made this a masterful thriller. Still, it's far more engaging than most of Universal's monster movies, including the two sequels which quickly followed. **1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"Special-Effects Laughable Now, But Photography Is Still Great","Date":"21 March 2007","Score":"12 out of 23 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" Only some pretty darned good photography saved this monster film from the '50s from exiting my VHS collection, as far as I was concerned.

The creature was hideous-looking and the head was extremely well-sculpted and dark green, with working gills and lips. (No bright-red lips as shown in the posters) The original does not play for intentional laughs, but some are obvious. (Terrible fake accents throughout.) The mostly-unoriginal music, patched together from several Universal films, is at it's worst when playing The Creature Attacks 3-note chorus. (Da-Da-Da) It is used every time the gill-man attacks, which kills the element of surprise. There is even a water ballet between the monster and the blonde bombshell, which is sensual in nature. Julie Adams (a Marilyn Monroe look-alike) looks unclothed in a white bathing suit underwater! (She isn't.) It's also not lost on me that the Gillman digs women! Best of the series, as #2 (Revenge) is just a big plug for Marineland. Walks Among Us has unoriginal themes about rehabilitating the monster, like 1940's Frankenstein sequels. Good video transfer, but my copy is not in 3D. It's a B movie with great 3D cinematography. All of the victims are insignificant characters except for the co-star!

As a dessert to the creature cake, it turns out a damn tasty course, even though in many respects it's a poor man's King Kong. It's also an interesting transitional movie between Universal's classic studio monster movies of old and the typical creature feature science fiction films of the Fifties, courtesy of Jack Arnold, one of the most prolific directors of the genre in this decade (his other works include It Came from Outer Space (1953), Tarantula (1955) and The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957)). A band of scientists stumbles on the remains of an 'amphibian missing link', a Gill Man (never mind actual science here). However, the animal was not the only one of its kind, since a live specimen starts stalking the group, in particular the beautiful girl (Julie Adams) among them, resulting in an (in)famous underwater swimming duet between the pair. Sadly, the romance is one-sided as the creature finds out when he tries to get a little closer to the object of his fascination but is instead met with fear, violence and eventually greed as the explorers mean to capture the beast and take it back to civilization. However, the monster has some thoughts of his own on that subject and doesn't surrender so easily, with deadly consequences. Beautiful &#x96; and for that time, spectacular &#x96; underwater photography, a solid cast (including fan favorite Richard Denning, who starred in a number of Fifties' Sci-Fi flicks, not all of them as good as this one) and an excellent balance between drama, action and romance. One of the first movies to be released in 3-D during the short lived 3-D craze in the Fifties with which Hollywood studios hoped to lure audiences away from the new medium of television (unsuccessfully it must be said).

Directed by Jack Arnold, the film finds a crew of scientists, researchers and crusty sailors embarking on a journey into the heart of the Amazon. Here they encounter and battle a strange aquatic monster.The film would prove a huge influence on Steven Spielberg's Jaws - also released by Universal Studios - which essentially borrows its score, plot, POV stalking shots and several sequences. Both films, for example, feature iconic shots from the monster's point of view as a woman swims directly overhead, both feature similar aquatic attacks, and both feature similar action sequences with cranes and winches.Lagoon's plot is bare-bones, and it won't scare modern audiences, but for fans of early creature features, it is some kind of goofy classic.

Yet, whenever they make a movie like this it seems some or all of the regular folks in the show are hell-bent on wiping out all trace of these potential money makers. It's really like looking a gift horse in the mouth! In CREATURE, a guy name Mark swims around for most of the movie trying to see how many spears he can shoot into the poor creature!

You think about the time this was made, what that audience's reactions must've been like and instead of being bombed with over the top CGI effects, we get when men used to get their hands dirty making a film. With the classic Creature from the Black Lagoon, we had a man dressed in a suit who not only acted scary but could hold his breath for minutes under water and got some incredibly beautiful shots ever to be put on film. In the 1950's, it was a time to be obsessed with outer space creatures or things not of our world. Creature from the Black Lagoon was the last of the Universal Monster pictures to come out besides the sequels that followed. I think this was the underdog judging by the ratings here on IMDb because this is one terrific film with a tragic creature who just wanted to be loved&#x85;I mean can you blame him when he was checking Julie Adams out? But man against nature takes place again making you wonder what you should just leave be but letting your curiosity get the better of you.A geology expedition uncovers fossilized evidence from the Devonian period of a link between land and sea animals in the form of a skeletal hand with webbed fingers. Expedition leader Carl Maia visits his friend, Dr. David Reed, an ichthyologist who works at a marine biology institute. Reed persuades the institute's financial backer, Dr. Mark Williams, to fund a return expedition to the Amazon to look for the remainder of the skeleton. The expedition consists of Dr. Reed, Dr. Maia and Williams, as well as Reed's girlfriend, Kay Lawrence, and another scientist, Dr. Thompson. When they arrive at Dr. Maia's camp, they discover that his entire research team has been mysteriously killed while he was away. Lucas suggests it was done by a jaguar, but the others are unsure. The creature, curious upon seeing the expedition, investigates the camp site, but when its sudden appearance frightens the members, they attack it, and in response, the enraged creature kills them. Now the creature has it's eyes on the expedition, the crew members and the lovely girlfriend and to give them a true taste of what they've been looking for.I give this film a lot of credit for the make up and the under water shots. The creature suits were very effective and looked so flowing under water, it looked incredibly real. Much kudos to the actors who played the creature on land and under water. For the 1950's the under water shots are just amazing and look flawless. The actors did a good job, especially Richard Carlson playing Reed, a strong male lead and had such a presence on screen. Julie Adams was just beautiful and a wonderful character, despite being a female in distress, those were just the days, I get a sense of feistyness from her still and such intelligence. There were some good intense scenes, you really get the chills when you realize that the creature could be watching the crew any time and anywhere. Creature from the Black Lagoon was the end of an era and a good way to end it creating a great monster and gave us a reason to stay away from the water. Jaws may have taken the crown, but the Creature just gave him some good lessons.8/10 "},{"Title":"Be seeing him again real soon...","Date":"11 October 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" That line above is from a song by Dave Edmunds on his Tracks on Wax album named after this very film - both are great fun and recommended.

It's a pity the monster looks so, well, unmonstrous but if you can suspend that disbelief, there's much to enjoy in this better than-average B-movie. The little-known actors all suspend their own disbelief throughout and acquit themselves well even as a fishy game of And Then There Were None is enacted in their midst. The underwater sequences are well shot too and the director keeps the story moving in the short running time. However you can always tell when the Creature's about - the orchestra takes it up a notch or ten, plus it's invariably behind you, always the last place our intrepid heroes look.

Part of the reason they wanted to make several is because of the excellent(and thus not exactly underexposed) suit. This, like King Kong, another classic that this bears noticeable resemblance to, has had an immeasurable effect on the world of cinema. It is easy to see what may quite possibly be the inspiration for Jaws in this, for example. This was directed by Jack Arnold, who also gave us the good Tarantula and It Came From Outer Space, as well as the outstanding The Incredible Shrinking Man. We are treated to another misunderstood monster, with the nifty twist of us being the invaders. The Creature does not come to us, we enter his territory. This has anti-xenophobic undertones, and it isn't sexist, if it is a tad racist. The characters are credible and well-developed, save for the obvious villain. Acting is solid, and this is well-cast(kudos on Julie's legs). This was shot in 3D, but it doesn't feel strange without the third dimension to it. The FX are nice enough. This has early underwater footage, and they look great. The music is marvelous and varied. There is a little mild violence and disturbing content in this. The DVD comes with a well-researched, funny and informative commentary track by film historian Tom Weaver, 11 and a half minutes of production photos and a 4 minute trailer.

There he is, minding his own business, swanning around his lonely lagoon, probably ruminating sadly about being the last of his species, when this boatload of nosy busibodies roll up. First of all they completely destroy his peace and tranquillity, then they titillate and tease him by having this young hottie go flaunting herself by swimming around in a skimpy (for 1954) white swimming cossie, then they pump tanks full of drugs at him, and finally they shoot and kill him. Not exactly cricket, is it? What's a Gill Man to do? I doubt that this scenario was fresh even back in '54, but it was a good deal fresher than it is now, nearly 60 years later. So one must try to look at this movie from a viewpoint which is not totally wearied by the movie industry endlessly recycling plots which work. Although once can perceive a certain naiveté in the presentation in this case, there is sufficient energy and imagination for this not to matter.The current flush of 3D material will, in my view, bring 3D to a much wider audience, ultimately by making home 3D viable for the first time. When that happens, I hope that the better 3D features from the 1950s 3D fad will be retooled for the new technology - I have only seen bits of Creature in 3D, but what I saw made very good use of 3D.The film as a whole has two major things going for it. One is the design of the Gill Man, one of the very best man in a monster suit designs. The other is the celebrated sequence where the Gill Man is swimming along below Julia Adams - a sequence of beauty, grace, menace and sensuousness unrivalled by anything on screen before or since.Addendum 1 October 2012 I have just watched the 3D Blu-ray newly released, and I must say that the 3D is stunning. There is only a minimal amount of jabbing things at the camera (thankfully) but the rest of the film makes excellent use of beautifully deep 3D, much more effective than many of the current movies released in 3D. Even the shots against a back projection screen work well. I doubt the movie looked this good when it was first released.

Already, we as filmgoers had seen The Thing, experienced the great robot in The Day The Earth Stood Still, penetrated The Unknown World deep within the Earth and noticed Them and suffered invasion when It Came From Outer Space. Now,it seemed to movie-makers the right time to start creating monsters. Many were gigantic--Godzilla, Reptilicus, The Beast From Twenty Thousand Fathoms and the Deadly Mantis; but a few were variations on a more-human or anthropomorphic scale--Mighty Joe Young, The Blob, the TeenagedWerewolf and the Creature From the Black Lagoon. I trace this idea in general to the excellence of golden-age sci-fi authors' imaginative works; and to the challenge to the false postmodernist false certainties of both republican statists and democratic altruists, ideas which had been soundly repudiated by the Nazi and Communist threats to a stable and safe world order. The film begins simply as an elderly scientist (Antonio Moreno) is told of a fabulous monster in South America. While he is investigating near the site, the so-called black Lagoon, and studying a fossil of a webbed and clawed hand, his party of assistants, bearers and guides is wiped out. He assembles a well-equipped team, including scientists Willaims (Richard Denning), Reed (Richard Carlson), KayLawrence (Julie Adams), Thompson (Whitner Bissell) and skipper Nestor Paiva as Lucas, owner of the boat Rita. They go to the Lagoon, wary but hopeful. Paiva has heard the legendary tale, and adds details as to what they have been told. It may be more intelligent than anyone realizes., he warns them. The creature attacks and proves to be very powerful and extremely dangerous. This is after it had spied on Kay while she swam in the lagoon. Carlson is all for leaving; but even when Thompson is injured, Denning, his rival for Adams' affections, insists on their staying. They devise a knockout potion that affects fish and should work on the gillman Creature. With some difficulty, they do capture it. But it breaks free and escapes. The Creature then uses a log to block their exit from the lagoon for the small ship; in the attempt to free it, Denning is killed. And then Adams is kidnapped that night by the Creature who takes her back to his underground cave. The others follow, and, at the end, rescuing Adams, they shoot the Creature who staggers back to the Black Lagoon and seems to have been killed. But of course it was to return for two sequels, so we are left with some doubt. The cast is very good in this unpretentious and very powerfully-made thriller. Carlson is intelligent and sensible, Adams is lovely and bright. Denning at his best as the fame-obsessed Williams; as Lucas, fine actor Nestor Paiva has one of his best movie parts, while Moreno does well as the elderly doctor and dependable Whit Bissell is also very good as always. The music for the film was done by Henry Mancini and Hans J. Salter; the cinematography by William J. Snyder and the art direction by Bernard Hertzbrun and Hilyard A. Brown. Russell A . Gausman and Ray Jeffers did the set decoration, and Rosemary Odell supplied Miss Adams' wardrobe. Veteran director Jack Arnold deserves the major credit for the fast-paced directing; the script was provided by Maurice Zimm who is credited with the story and Harry Essex and Arthur A. Ross who did the intelligent screenplay. This is a very effective and much-copied film, as well-made a B scary film as one can find.

The rickety, old boat chugging down the Amazon only to be stalked and then trapped by the Creature was a classic method of stranding both the characters and the audience in the middle of nowhere. The music was perfect for the story and the four note Creature intro remains one of the most haunting and jarring in the history of fright.While the sequel was arguably as good as the original, the third film lost just a step. It is well that another, fourth movie was not made at the time. The sight of the, now mostly human gill-less man, looking longingly out to his ocean home from the top of a beachside cliff and the his walking out to the sea and certain death ( since he can not longer live and breathe underwater) is a fitting way to end the trilogy.I only hope that if Universal should plan a remake of this American Classic, they will not computer generate a Gill Man, and will choose to retain the man in the Creature suit. I believe the audience subconsciously picked up on the human mannerisms of the actor playing the Creature and wanted it to be safe and to live on.

It's a classic because it is so watchable time after time.If you watch The Creature From The Black Lagoon to critique the acting performances and the special effects, you are going to miss the beauty of this film.  It's all about mood and atmosphere.  It's all about the actors succeeding in their roles as corny scientists who buy into the silly notion of evolution in their intentionally confident wooden  performances.  It's about the music coming to a dramatic crescendo when the you see the webbed hand of the creature.  It's about the shadows and light in the photography. It's about the eyes of the Creature.  It's about going into the world of 1954 where these folks are on an expedition in hopes of making a scientific discovery and they end up in a creepy place but try to take it in stride.  In all of these areas this film succeeds brilliantly.  It uses visual images to spark the imagination and take us back in time to 1954 when these scientists considered themselves to be analytical and sensible.  Their world and time was different than ours.The Creature From The Black Lagoon is near the top of 1950's campy horror movies where the creature is a tragic character and the other actors play straight man to the creature's campy performance.  It's Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart's African Queen, science fiction style.  The interesting thing about the Creature From the Black Lagoon is that it doesn't let itself get bogged down by implausibilities because there are none in the minds of the characters.

Quite a lot of very good, though ultimately boring underwater swimming scenes.....the movie must be about 30% underwater swimming...No credit at all for whoever played the gill man monster, obviously a stunt man wrapped in a rubber fish suit roughly the proportions of a man, but with a fish face head (but two arms, two legs, and who swam like a guy underwater, but with no aqualung).The movie was clever, and not badly done (relatively speaking).The premise was that a prehistoric throw-back gill man monster was found in a back-water location in the Amazon jungles of Brazil, and scientists went to 'bring him back.'Well....they got theirs. The gill man fights back.....gets captured, but escapes, gets speared several times, but just breaks off the spears stuck in him and swims/ runs away.Problem the movie didn't quite solve was how to stretch the simple premise (monster loose in the Amazon Brazillian jungle waters) into two hours worth of non-boring movie...how to keep the movie going, interesting.....Well.....now 84 year old Julia Adams was 28 when the movie was made, and she swims around in her one piece white bathing suit and fabulous, Pammy Grable style legs (insured by Universal Studios for $1 Million! so the publicity of the times went). Lots of tits and ass shots from Julia from the start of the movie all the way thru....they couldn't have kept people interested without her and her legs and screams.Pretty good low key acting from the two main guys, Richard Carlson and Richard Denning, and also from the comic boat captain with his Frito Bandito accent and sense of humor.The whole story takes place on a small boat and in the water (under it), and that's a lot of time in small places....made the movie cheap to make...important!Music was well done and important, and so was the editing often showing fragments of the monster gill man (esp. his webbed hand with BIG fingernails....big hand, come to think of it, considering the gill man was the size of a normal male dressed in a fish suit!).....I dunno.......The question (well...a question) is how to do TWO HOURS and keep it all going without spending BIG money of special effects (as in JAWS 1975 or KING KONG 1933)?CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON (1954) became famous and made a lot of money....but it was and is not work of art....just an icon of pop culture...no high water mark in cinema culture at the level of CITIZEN KANE or CASABLANCA. --------------Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.

But that's just my opinion. And I like him. He seems more intelligent than many of the big creatures in the movies, has a motive for all that he does, and the costume works. So that's my take on the creature himself.The movie around him also has its charms. A scientist discovers part of a fossilized skeleton of an unknown creature and leads an expedition back to the site to try to find the rest of the fossils. They are amazed when they come across a living specimen of the fossil and surprised when it fights back when they try to capture it.The filmmakers have done a good job of building and maintaining an element of dread throughout the film, while still keeping up the pace so that it never gets boring. I mean, you know the creature is there, just not when it will strike. The underwater scenes are incredible, especially when one considers that this was filmed in the 1950's.Overall, it's not my favorite of the Universal classics, but it has a high re-watchability factor and has enough action and suspense combined with good pacing that one's interest is maintained.

Yeah, it's a guy in a rubber suit but Jaws was fake fish that got the point across pretty good too. This film spawned a couple of sequels in Revenge of the Creature and The Creature Walks Among Us but I don't recall ever seeing the third installment from a different director. Jack Arnold directed this and the sequel. He had previously directed It Came From Outer Space and would be responsible for a lot of 50's sci-fi flicks like The Incredible Shrinking Man, Tarantula, This Island Earth and Monster on Campus before a successful television directorial career in comedies and dramas that took him into the 1970's. Cinematographer William E. Snyder who had done such legitimate films as The Loves of Carmen, Blue Skys and The Flying Leathernecks photographed this film. Look for bad acting from Richard Carlson, Julie Adams, Richard Denning and Antonio Moreno but the story moves along OK. I see that Universal has plans for a remake with Gary Ross, who wrote Sea Biscuit, Big and Pleasantville, doing the screenplay. It's a beauty and the beast type theme and a good example of 50's monster movies and I would give it a 7.5 out of 10.

And this 1954 Universal Film certainly delivers on that score, the legendary creature earning his place among the pantheon of Universal's all star lineup - Frankenstein, Dracula, Wolfman and The Mummy. The story however doesn't hold up as well as it's earlier classic counterparts, partly for it's lack of an enduring name star (Karloff, Lugosi, Chaney), and partly for it's more modern look, having been released in 1954. The film sets up the dramatic tension soon enough, within minutes we are treated to a quick glimpse of a fan shaped, webbed claw that eerily emanates from a swampy pool. In discussing the skeletal remains of an unknown creature discovered on a prior expedition, lead scientist David Reed (Richard Carlson) makes a prophetic statement about spaceships someday traveling to other planets. With financing provided by Mark Williams (Richard Denning), the scientific group heads off to the upper Amazon Valley to try to unravel the mystery. Among the group is Reed's fiancé Kay Lawrence (Julia Adams), providing the obligatory love interest for both Reed and the Creature. In fact, the Creature's obsession with Kay is craftily handled from the outset, it's first encounter resulting in a synchronized swim in the river and a playful tease of Kay's feet before she ever sets eyes on the monster. The underwater photography is deftly done, particularly since so much time is spent there. What does get somewhat annoying though is the persistent bickering between Reed and Williams on the goal of the expedition. Taking the scientific approach, Reed wants to catalog virtually everything to do with the Creature and it's habitat, while Williams wants nothing less than to capture the monster to make his mark in the scientific world. All bets are off though when the Gill-Man kidnaps Kay from the boat and brings her to his underwater grotto. In pursuit, Reed emerges into the grotto and is approached by a giant flying bat - did anyone else get the impression that it was about to turn into Count Dracula?In somewhat of a standoff, Reed insures that the Creature is not harmed by the overzealous armed crew, as it makes it's way back into the safety of the lagoon. It appears to descend lifelessly into the murky depths, but even back in the 1950's the final fade seemed to scream sequel. And so it was, in two Creature follow ups, 1955's Revenge of the Creature and the 1956 film The Creature Walks Among Us, neither of which brought back any of the principals from the first film.

But what about the rest of us?After all, Creature from the Black lagoon really seems to have very little going for it. Presented by a troop of career B and B- actors, the most remarkable aspect of the cast is how good looking the protagonists are. The dialogue is wildly over-dramatic, and the plot has been used and reused hundreds of times before and after COBL in monster flicks of every shape and size. A paleontologist finds a new species fossilized in Paleozoic rock which appears to have characteristics of a fish and a primate. The science terminology and concepts in COBL is off, but not as bad as most of what I have seen out of Hollywood. What our paleontologist doesn't know is that his new species is still lurking around in a nearby lagoon. An expedition is launched, including two handsome young men and a young woman who are entangled romantically. The would-be lover of the beautiful but not very courageous Kay (Julia Adams) is also her employer (Richard Denning) and her actual lover is played by Richard Carlson. As opposed to a mere distraction, the interplay between these three, though not very well acted or scripted, helps build tension throughout the first half of the film - as the creature tentatively approaches the boat and begins to scope out his human prey. The story is essentially a well-constructed version of King Kong, Alien, It Came from Outer Space, and several other films, set in the Amazonian rainforest. The Director, Jack Arnold would later write and direct several hit TV shows - but what can be seen in COBL really just hints at his talent. Some of the cinematography is spectacular. the underwater scenes are all excellent - even the seemingly pointless swimming scenes are gorgeously shot and interesting, and the actor who performed the title role of The Creature did a wonderful job of stayng in character and inventing an inhuman personality. The creature's costume is terrific! When I first saw this film, I found the score startling and creepy. Today, its somewhere between annoying and hilarious.Creature from the Black Lagoon is a better film than it should be and not quite as good as its reputation. It is, however, a true classic and most definitely worth seeing. Popcorn and alcohol recommended, however.

David(Richard Carlson)is the head scientist, and love of Kay's life, who was called to the expedition by Carl(Antonio Moreno)whose village help assisted in finding the fossil hand. Mark(Richard Denning), who is funding this expedition, becomes obsessed with catching the gillman because not only does it provide proof of existing undiscovered life, but sure to bring a heavy profit.Yet, one by one members of the Rita boat crew are being killed by the gillman as do various members of the scientific team which bring David to an unfortunate decision..leave their locale for safety forgetting the new discovery. Complications ensue when the creature blocks their passage out with a massive tree and Mark's desperation causes conflict. But, the major suspense comes from the gillman's desire to steal away Kay posing quite a threat as he tries to sneak on board various times.The underwater photography is magnificent, the rubber suit is excellent providing us with quite a monster, and the film is well acted. The fact that this film is intelligent made by a group of filmmakers desiring to make a good film, not just some sort of hokey nonsense to make profit.

The scene with the dead fishes, throwing the cigarette on the water or the the fate of the creature in the end of the story illustrate this lack of concern with the environment. In the present days, it would be considered politically incorrect. Further, the unappropriated clothes of Kay for a dense jungle are very funny. The scene when Kay is swimming in Amazonas river and the creature is following her underwater is amazing.

I can remember that Marilyn Monroe likes this tender creature -Richard Carlson is very worse- as she says to Tom Ewell at a sequence of The Seven Year Itch. I can imagine that the Black Lagoon Creature, a amphibious fish fallen in love for Julie Adams, must be very horrible by his time (1954) and that Julie Adams looks very erotic in her shorts pants. Today all that is very ingenuous.

This is arguably one of those movies. Plainly, nothing that occurs above the surface is of any interest -- this is painfully bad 'man in a rubber suit' schlock (there's one slight exception). The egghead/photographer debates with the promoter/hunter over what to do with him.However, once underwater there are key visual bits. Most famously is the creature-perspective view upwards towards a water-treading Adams. She's not allowed to be nude, but it's suggested. This was blatantly stolen by Spielberg for Jaws.This seems to spend half of the running time underwater, and they successfully film the critter/man without a single air bubble escaping. Once above water, he's rather clumsy. He's even burned and has to extinguish himself in the lagoon -- note that this was the template used for the immolation scene in Scorcese's Cape Fear.The creature attempts to kill all of his masculine 'rivals', so he can kidnap and possess the girl -- a narrative straight out of King Kong. This sort of unrequited sexual attraction distinguishes the monster flicks from the slasher flicks (the Psycho-styled bad guys are emasculated and have to plunge knives).

This is true and boy, did they go out with a bang!This is my review on The Creature From The Black LagoonNOTE I do NOT believe in millions of years or the evolution theory so I'm just leaving them bits out, just like I ignored it in the movie.The plot goes like this; Scientists find a fish like claw sticking out of a rock down a tributary of some river in South America. They are curious to know what could've owned this strange hand. One suspects that the rest of the skeleton might have been blown downstream. He and the rest of the scientists head downstream into unexplored territory- The black lagoon. during their research they find out that they are in the habitat of a fish-like monster. Out of all the universal monsters (Wolfman, Drackula etc) The creature is probably the most diverse. The story feels more like a sci fi than a horror and there are no haunted mansions, creepy graveyards or bleak dungeons. Instead, the movie takes place in a very dark lagoon. Lots of the movie takes place underwater. There are scenes were the scientists go diving for bits of rocks to compare with the skeleton (Don't ask me, I'm no scientist!) Also is shows some very interesting scenes of the monster darting through the water towards it's prey. These scenes are phenomenal for a 50s film and it is evidence that you don't need CGI for everything which films now-a-days seem to have. I personally haven't a clue on how they filmed all these scenes. It's hard to describe on a written review but when you watch the film you will no what I mean.The acting isn't top notch but it's OK. The main character aren't really that memorable, but they don't need to be! it's the monster you watch it for!For a 50s film, the monster looks rather frightening, certainly for younger viewers. Even I found some of the scenes quite creepy. The monster hunts down all the scientists who have been travelling into his lagoon on a bust-up old barge. It's interesting to watch the monster react to the humans as if he could understand them. The man the the suit needs an Oscar! Constantly in the film, no matter how many times the scientists try to stop the monster, it just keeps coming back for more. This chemistry never gets old for me and it's just a joy to see the many attempts of the creature.The final 10 minutes really tip the scale of this little gem. We've got underwater battles with the creature. We've got the creature kidnapping a damsel in distress. We've got a got pursuit with guns and...erm.. claws. The last scene is just worth it alone. They finally hunt the creature down and, unfortunately, kill it. For me, this was rather sad that a fantastic movie monster was killed of in it's first film. If you are like me, don't fret! There is 2 more movies to sink your teeth into however I have not got round to seeing them so Icannot say wither they are good or bad.All in all, probably one of the best universal monster classics with great monster, fantastic hunt, an under water battle and some of the best cinematography ever filmed. There is evolution in it which I don't agree with, but bypassing it this is one of my all time favs. "},{"Title":"This Is a Universal Classic","Date":"11 August 2011","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" A strange prehistoric beast (Ricou Browning) lurks in the depths of the Amazonian jungle. A group of scientists try to capture the animal and bring it back to civilization for study.Various writers claim credit for this film, though Tom weaver (the expert) gives the bulk of the credit to William Allen. Apparently an earlier script, or maybe even pre-script, had an additional bad guy character and some sequences which are very much a retelling of the King Kong story. William Allen, the writer, freely admitted he was writing King Kong on the water. From director Jack Arnold, the Gill Man has since become one of the Universal monsters (though probably second tier, as he is not nearly as popular and appeared twenty years too late) and has achieved his own Legacy collection box set. You have made it to the big time, Gill. And, to be fair, even second tier Universal is better than most other monsters out there. Universal keeps trying to make the Metaluna creature a Universal monster, but... really?I met Ricou Browning, who plays the creature underwater, a few years ago. Great guy. Why do I mention this? Because he has been so forgotten, and I think he should be called out. Is he on par with Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi or Lon Chaney? No. But the fact he is not even credited is a sad comment on how he was treated.Why is this a classic? To be honest, I am not sure. It was a fine film, but nothing spectacular and really on par with much of Arnold's films. I do not know how this became a minor franchise... but hey, now we have it, and soon there will likely be a remake. As I understand it, the reviews at the time were not favorable, and appreciation has grown since.Howard Maxford calls it tame, but having effective underwater sequences. That is not a bold statement and one I must agree with. Perhaps this underwater stuff made it a classic? I mean, I guess people did not see that much before Jaws. Who knows? Mike Mayo claims the only reason this film succeeded was sex, the then-racy bathing suit by Julie Adams. I like Mayo's theory...The Creature plot anticipates the Italian cannibal film, which is interesting. We go from King Kong to the Creature, both sympathetic in their own way and wanting to be loved. But then we also have these white folks in the jungle going down the river, an image that exists in pretty much every cannibal film. Was it a conscious homage? Probably not, but I say it's there.Oh, and the film is educational, too I learned what rotenone is and how to use it against sea monsters. It's an odorless, colorless, crystalline isoflavone used as a broad-spectrum insecticide, piscicide, and pesticide. Science!

They get the funding they need, and take a journey aboard a steamer along with a ragtag gang including Dr. Williams (Richard Denning), who may be in love with Reed's lady Kay (Julia Adams). When arriving at the site, they find the former camp decimated, and a dead body. An ancestor of the fossilised 'gill-man' may be lingering in the water with murder and terror in mind.Of all the monster 'creature-features' that flowed out of the 1950's, that mainly consisted of a man dressed up in a badly made suit or a leftover from a previous films' wardrobe department, the most iconic has to be the image of the gill-man carrying Kay, or coming out of the water. These films were quick and cheap to make, always had an eager marketplace, and were ripe for over-elaborate posters that were usually always far better than the film was ever going to be. The gill-man image is well remembered not only because it's a pretty cool costume, but also because Creature From The Black Lagoon is actually a good film.The creature-feature genre is always restricted to its formulaic plot devices and tick-boxes of screaming girlfriend, square-jawed hero, and a generally non-threatening monster than you could easily run away from if in real-life or had at least half a brain. But what places Black Lagoon above the vast majority is the fact that it makes the most of these restrictions. The monster itself, although clearly a man in a suit, is genuinely quite creepy. The scene where he watches motionless from his underwater cage, his mouth slowly opening and closing like that of a fish, is unnerving.The Amazonian backdrop is captured with a flair that goes beyond the film's budget limitations by cinematographer William E. Synder, something of a B-movie regular, and the underwater shots are mysterious and sometimes beautiful, as the two lead macho men battle with the gill- man and each other's testosterone. But most importantly, its riotously entertaining stuff, which differs from most pictures in the genre that usually have one entertaining scene surrounded by bad acting and boring plotting. It was never going to be anything more than very good, given it's limitations, but it is, and makes me sad to think that modern films will never be able to capture this sort of innocent charm.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com "},{"Title":"Even I, BA_Harrison, have heard the legend of a man-fish.","Date":"14 April 2010","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" On the surface, Universal's Creature From The Black Lagoon hardly looks like the stuff that classics are made of a low-budget B-movie monster flick that borrows the age old 'beauty and the beast' theme from King Kong, opts for the 'man in a rubber monster suit' option, confines its action to virtually a single location&#x97;the Black Lagoon of the title&#x97;in order to keep costs down, and throws in the gimmick of 3D to get bums on seats. Dive in, however, and you'll discover a film that is rich in excitement, teeming with action, and alive with adventure.Under the guidance of ace director Jack Arnold (Tarantula, The Incredible Shrinking Man, It Came From Outer Space), this potentially hum-drum creature feature becomes a hugely entertaining exercise in minimalist B-movie horror, a little light on logic perhaps (only one gill-man?), but never offering a dull moment Arnold's deft handling of his derivative tale ensures that boredom is never an option; Bud Westmore's brilliantly conceived monster suit creates a lasting impression; the stunning underwater cinematography adds immensely to the atmosphere of the film; and as if that wasn't enough, there's the gorgeous Julie Adams in a swimsuit, whose ample curves understandably send the prehistoric gill-man on his hormone fuelled rampage.7.5 out of 10, happily rounded up to 8 for the lovely Ms. Adams, who kindly braves a swim in the Amazon to provide gratuitous eye-candy for us guys.

The movie has one idea an amphibious creature swims about in a lagoon. Oh, and it's a black lagoon. From there the writers were clearly stuck for something to happen, because nothing does, and the movie takes its time about it.The poor actors wade through the kind of pseudo-scientific dialogue typical of '50s sci-fi (the sort of thing that Whit Bissell is never far from), before they set off to find the hideous gill man, a lengthy and intense search for a monster from the dawn of time that consists of them paddling down a river for a while. The movie then repeats the same scene over and over again as the creature rises from the depths to attack the boat, an ear-splitting 'Deeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!' honking on the soundtrack each and every time. The design of the gill man isn't too bad, although he is a bit of an ungainly swimmer for an animal supposedly at home in the water, and his face is a tad gormless. It looks as though every last scrap of underwater footage shot for the film was used, plenty of straggly weeds getting in the way of the creature flailing about in the dirtiest water this side of the toilet in 'Trainspotting'. It's a typical genre movie of the period, and it's unfortunately one that's no fun at all. It's repetitious and boring.

Some of them get away.That's about it for the plot, which I'm sure must be adequately described elsewhere. Just a few rambling comments seem called for.In Samoa there are tidal pools sprinkled among the jagged lava rocks of the coast, ranging in size from goldfish bowls to bathtubs. The natives have a substance similar to the one used in this movie to disable the gill man. I forget what it's called in Samoan but it's English name is something similar to rotinone. You scrape it into the water from a seed the size of a walnut. The Samoans use it to make the fish jump out of the pools. It doesn't make them groggy, as in the movie. It irritates the hell out of them and prompts them to leap out of the pool. This is both good and bad. Some of the tropical fish are colorful and shaped like boxes. I hated seeing them so irritated. But the mud skippers, an inch or two long and of an undistinguished gray, although they look exactly like fish, act more like tiny frogs. They don't need any initial prompting. They pop out of the pools and sit on rocks and look at you with their goggle eyes. I didn't mind their being irritated. Those eyes -- those staring eyes! Of course I realize there are good and bad among mud skippers, as there are among humans.Fossils. The scientists discover a fossil buried in a river bank. The fossil is rubbery. That means it is no fossil at all. Fossilization is a very complicated process in which each cell of the original tissue is replaced by a mineral compound, I think mostly some compound of calcium. Any real fossil is going to be made of rock. It won't flap when you wave it. And after a couple of million years it would have been disarticulated.But they got the fingers right. Five on each hand, or flipper, or pseudopod. A host of creatures probably crawled out of the primordial sea and were complicated enough to develop endoskeletal limbs. Some may have had two fingers, others ten. They all died out except the ones that just happened to have five digits. Now everything that has a skeleton and limbs with digits have five digits -- from humans to horses to bats to whales. The gill man may have been an evolutionary dead end but his family tree didn't branch off from the trunk until after those five digits had become the received number, early on. He has a thumb too, but it's not opposable like ours but rather more like an orangutan's. He'll have a good power grip but no precision grip. He may be a terrific swimmer but he'll never fix your TV set if it requires a screwdriver. And he'll have to hold a pencil like the handle of a hammer.Julia Adams. Why does she insist on wearing these tight shorts that simply serve to emphasize her succulent rear? No wonder the gill man is after her. Any normal male would immediately want to jump on her and pinch her. But then, as far as that goes, what did the gill man have in mind for her? Cross-generic reproduction isn't possible. Had the same problem with King Kong.For 1954 you weren't likely to find a sexier scene that Julia Adams with her dark, Audrey-Hepburn eyebrows swimming along the surface while the gill man swims in a suggestive position beneath her. The gill man may be a primitive evolutionary dead end, but he's nobody's fool.And what is he doing all alone in the Black Lagoon? Is he the last living specimen? If not, where is the breeding pool? The plot is full of such holes.For what it's worth, the heavy here is not so much the gill man as Mark (Richard Denning), who wants to kill him and bring him home as a trophy and as proof that the creature exists. The same argument is advanced now -- in real life -- about Bigfoot, if it exists at all. And Bigfoot, if the tales are to be believed, is a primate. Just like us.Back to the movie. It's an original, directed by Jack Arnold, king of the monster movies, and brought out by Universal Studios. I enjoy it on those occasions when it's on. It lacks all pretension and is simple minded, yet it's engaging. There isn't a dull moment in it and very little complexity to befoul our enjoyment of this simple cartoonish tale.Well worth seeing.

They show little teasers--such as a hand coming out of the water or catch a quick glimpse--but you KNOW it's coming! And, interestingly, at first you feel a bit sorry for the creature, as Denning is determined to kill it and bring it back to America to gain fame for himself. Later, however, the creature appears to be the hunter--and the film becomes tense and exciting.While the plot of this film is amazingly simple, there is a lot to like. While crappy sea monsters abound in horror films of the era, this one is far from it. Even today, more than 50 years later, you have to marvel at the costume that looks almost real. Heck, even the gills on the monster's neck flare in and out, as the special effects masters really pulled out all the stops. Additionally, the film had lots of amazing underwater cinematography--and it didn't end up looking like some back lot swimming pool, either, but a real freshwater lagoon!

I don,t even have creature from black lagoon in my video collection,that,s how little i care about it.The only thing this movie is better than is a trip to the dentist.So if you are looking for a night of movie entertainment that gives you thrills and chills that you can,t stop talking about,DON,T watch creature from the black lagoon.You will never get that hour and a half of your life back.

The best example of this is the monster itself The Gill-Man, it is so obvious that it's a guy in a rubber suit that now days it is laughable! But does it really matter? No, it doesn't, in a way it makes the movie irresistible.The story itself is simple and weak and is basically about the Gill-Man that comes out of the water every now and then to kill a person. For a horror movie it just isn't scary enough so I see it more as an adventure movie instead.There are some nice characters in the movie and the acting was way better then I expected. The underwater scene's with the Gill-Man are beautiful and very well done. Another thing I like is the Typical 50's B-monster film mood music that creates a nice atmosphere. The biggest mistake the film makers made is that they showed too much of the monster, they should have showed less so he would had been more mysterious and maybe even scary.Not a classic, but still very amusing and watchable and highly recommendable if you like old monster movies.6/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Not Universal's best","Date":"22 May 2015","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" Well Universal's monster movies tend to be good, interesting story and characters, character development, so you actually get sympathy for them. I have seen this in Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy, Wolf Man, King Kong, The Invisible Man. I couldn't find that in Creature of the Black Lagoon. I understand how iconic the monster is and what an influence it must have been of later movies with water creatures however I couldn't help to be quite unimpressed by the boring dialog, the paper thin plot, the one-dimensional characters. Even with some 75 minutes duration I found it quite tedious to get to the end. The points I give it are because the monster looks good and threatening and the nice underwater scenes.

The one above water is the human world of story-noise, explanations and cheap jump-scares , the world of bad storytelling and bad horror. Everyone bickers and fights, and with the exception of the woman, they are simply unappealing to spend time next to. The rubber creature looks much more fake in broad daylight, and we see a lot of it in closeup. Everything is off.As part of those explanations is the shoehorned reminder that outer space beckons with mystery, new worlds rife for discovery. That was a time when the excitement for space was much more urgent than it is now, when a lot of it has petered out by a better understanding of the practical difficulties and long-term planning required. This does not take place in outer space but is about about a similar desire to explore.The second world that is explored is one of inner space, discovery and submerged eroticism, the film simply lights up every time we swoop down there. The creature in its natural environment is imbued with magic of sorts, looks wide-eyed and curious. There is no talk, no story. Light is scarce, gauzy. Character is crystallized in the flow of action killer, photographer-explorer, dancer.Not all of the underwater photography is stunning, but some of it really is quite beautiful. The underwater ballet of anticipatory touch between awestruck instinct and swanlike female grace on the surface is sublime.That is a world where hallucinatory smoke rains down from mysterious beings above liquid skies, this is an actual scene in the film when the hunters try to gas the creature below, and one of the most poignant I have seen in a film.

In fact, it goes nearly twenty-five minutes before we even get to see the creature's face. A more thoughtful offering than usual, its aquatic missing link musings may win the hotly contested most clumsy use of exposition in a Universal horror award but are still commendable. However, as is the problem with most of the studio's later output, there is little beyond the initial premise to keep things moving. Once it's established that there's a half-human monster at the bottom of the lagoon there's nothing to do except sit it out and wait for the creature to get killed. The laborious pace isn't helped with interminable tracts of nicely directed yet ultimately dull underwater sequences. The breaks between attacks are there to build suspense, though merely contribute boredom. While it shows commendable ambition for the studio, having 18 minutes of the film's brief runtime underwater means that a huge percentage goes without dialogue. Research reminds us that the movie was released in 3D, explaining this stance somewhat. Yet this is not an issue when you're watching a non-3D video release, highlighting the shortcomings of the script.But the biggest problem is the creature itself. Frankly, it looks ridiculous. Underwater, helmed by James C.Havens, it's passable, but on land under Jack Arnold's direction it's just a silly old man in a rubber suit. Okay, this is rather a shallow judgement, but then this is rather a shallow film. The incidental music is even more repetitive than the plot, and where is the creature's family? As a mammal he'd have to have parents or offspring, wouldn't he? Maybe the two sequels revealed this, or why he should have a soft spot for Julia Adams. I doubt it though, and I'm certainly in no hurry to watch them to find out.If this was made as a tongue-in-cheek parody it would be understandable, but the whole thing is performed so seriously - almost pompously - that it's impossible even to laugh with it. Did people really find this sort of thing scary fifty years ago? Creature from the Black Lagoon. No moral. No meaning. No point.

He doesn't know that the species still exists at that site. He returns back to the States. He convinces David Reed (Richard Carlson) and Kay Lawrence (Julie Adams) to join him and find the rest of the skeleton funded by Reed's publicity-minded boss Mark Williams (Richard Denning). Meanwhile back at the camp, the creature attacks and kills everybody. The team arrives and assumes that there had been a jaguar attack.This is a simple low budget B-movie horror. The acting is stiff and the directing is limited. It's not anything unexpected from a B-horror other than the vast amount of underwater work. It's got the great title. It's more compelling as a concept than an actual movie. The movie is quite slow. The underwater shots are interesting but not exciting at all. It's not scary but it's a good 50s horror.

A group of people like Dr. David Reed (Richard Carlson) with his fiancée Kay Lawrence (Juliee Adams), Dr. Carl Maia (Antonio Moreno) and others have discovered a bizarre fossil as they go into the Amazon jungle to see if this kind of creature still exist, yet a Gill-Man is still alive as it sets his eyes on Kay as he falls in love with her and kidnaps the woman yet her boyfriend with others must try to save her.One of the greatest sci-fi and horror films ever and the last Universal monster icon movie ever in the franchise which began with the 20's versions of Hunchback/Phantom of the Opera then with Dracula in 1931. Universal had box-office success with the 3D Sci-fi joint It Came from Outer Space and they decided to do something different, Jack Arnold who directed this film had a concept for a film that is inspired by South American legends of gill-men and the 1933 classic King Kong especially the old story of Beauty and The Beast. The performances with style and atmosphere are superb, not only those but it gave an iconic monster in both the sci-fi and horror genres as the Gill-Man has became a beloved icon like the other Universal monsters making him a hit character as he is in merchandise over the years and even had a popular show in Universal Studios. The film was a box-office hit and one of the first major 3D films, this movie is a great work of horror/sci-fi cinema that is very influential "},{"Title":"Barely watchable","Date":"2 November 2002","Score":"5 out of 19 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  This is one of those movies that almost everyone has heard of, but few people except die-hard Universal monster fans have seen.  I now know why...IT SUCKS!  The acting and dialogue make you cringe (and not with fear), the plot is boring and repetitive, and the music is so over-the-top it gets annoying about 30 minutes into the movie.  Honestly, the main purpose to the film seems to have been to show off underwater cameras...which may have been novel in 1954, but quickly lose appeal for a modern audience.SPOILERS AHEAD...if someone can watch this movie and not get ticked off at the hero for insisting no one harm the creature, even after it kills multiple people and swims off with the heroine, I'd be impressed.The only really good thing about this movie is the Gillman costume.  Oh, and the fact that you can see the influence it must have had on Spielberg when he made Jaws (think of the winch straining to pull up the net).If you aren't a complete film geek, and just want to watch an enjoyable old horror movie, Frankenstein, Dracula, and King Kong are a hundred times better than Creature From the Black Lagoon.

Probably due to the fact that nothing really happens. The plot can be summed up in a couple of sentences1. A group of people travel to the black lagoon to find an undiscovered aquatic humanoid animal 2. They find the undiscovered aquatic humanoid animal 3. The creature attacks them 4. They fight back and win 5. They leaveExtremely simple plot. This could have easily been a short film, but it is stuffed to the brim with pointless filler scenes to make it a feature. The characters are all just your cliché, average cast of action heroes that you'll see in every movie. 90% of the film is just pointless underwater footage of people scuba diving and the creature watching them. The scenes go no where and last several minutes. They also seem to be quite common.Finally towards the end, the creature eventually attacks and we get a little bit of dull, cheesy action that only lasts a minute or so. Then, in the last 5 minutes, they try to squeeze in the most underwhelming, dissatisfying climax in the history of mankind. Creature steals girl. Man goes after girl. Man shoots creature. Man rescues girl. Bam! Movie's over, credits roll.This might be the worst paced movie I have ever seen...and I've seen Birdemic Shock and Terror. "}]
