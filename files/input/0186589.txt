[{"Title":"All the nice that's fit to print","Date":"8 October 2001","Score":"27 out of 32 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":"  A high school cheerleading squad robs a bank in order to support the burgeoning family of one of their own. They get the idea watching the Keanu Reeves movie Point Break and then watch movies like Reservoir Dogs and Dog Day Afternoon to figure out how exactly to pull the caper off.Now, I know what you're thinking. Sounds like a cutesy family movie, right? The kind that warms the cockles, wherever they are. Well, almost. It's a dead-on, surprisingly hilarious comedy, with perfect off-center performances and a crisp, honest script.The last cheerleading movie I saw (and quick, can you name more than a couple anyway? Didn't think so) was the Kirsten Dunst comedy Bring It On. This one blows that out of the water, out of the atmosphere, and out of the solar system. There's no moralizing. There's no good-girls-are-right, bad-girls-are-wrong lesson. Heck, we're talking about teenage girls pulling off a robbery! And one thing that could have sunk this movie early on was a character change. You've seen movies in which a character, faced with a new set of circumstances, does a 180-degree turnaround on how they've behaved up to that point. In this movie, you'd expect the girls to suddenly become flawless professional robbers. Not so. And while their plan has its faults, it's still a plan, buoyed by the vacant aphorisms of their leader, the pregnant and chipper Diane (Marley Shelton). Sing-songy and ebullient, the kids squabble among themselves but, in the true spirit of cheerleading and gosh-darn Girl Scout-like togetherness, they pull together as a team. Hip! Hip! Hooray!Decent cheerleading movies are hard to come by. Come to think of it, so are any cheerleading movies. Oh, not that I'm looking, but I can name only two off the top of my head Bring It On and the legendary, overlooked (okay, just kidding) 1977 opus Satan's Cheerleaders. But the latter's pep squad was in college, so it's different. But I digress.Truth be told, there's not a dull moment in the movie. Diane's knocked up before the prom by her dimwit football-hero boyfriend. This guy's so stupid he gets himself fired from such seemingly unfireable jobs as fast-food employee and other glamorous retail employment opportunities. See, in the real world, he'd be upset that the luster had worn off his diamond of an image, having to work with geeks at the video store. But he's a dope, blissfully ignorant. He knows but one thing - that he loves Diane - and being such a dullard is supremely helpful to the film (and isn't easy to do; kudos goes to James Marsden in the role).In short, a real hoot. We've seen many bank robbery movies with their own twists and idiosyncrasies; this one's one of the better ones to come down the pike. Go team go!

I loved this movie- to me it was like Clueless meets Point Break. It was amazing, and i thought all performances were great.This new line cinema film, may have been a low budget one, but it was brilliant. Marley Shelton's character of Diane Weston, may not have been the perfect protagonist for this kind of movie,but she was sweet and funny- what i found good was Rachel Blanchard's portrayal as Hannah. We saw her before playing Cher is the unsuccesfull 'clueless' TV series, and in Road Trip as Tiffany- well though those were just inconsiderable, this performance was something different. Mena Suvari made a really good Kansas. Her partial sweet/tough looks, made her seem the perfect casting decision.All in all- this mix of comedy and drama, makes this movie a great film for all teenagers. The famous pose of the 6 girls at the police station, is certainly unforgettable.

I have no idea why. I mean, if bigger flop movies like Say It Isn't So and Josie And The Pussycats (-Was only released in a couple of cinemas though.) were released here than why not Sugar And Spice. Anyway, it was out to buy on DVD over here on Monday, so I brought it straight away. (The DVD contains no extras, just the movie trailer.)Sugar And Spice a was comedy movie mixed with crime. It was NOTHING like cheerleading flick, Bring It On though. Yes, Sugar And Spice was about cheerleaders and there was the odd cheer at the high-school but that's it.Now, Sugar And Spice, is about a group of high school cheerleaders, who are all the best of friends, and they would do anything for each-other. When one of them becomes pregnant with the star quarterback's child, she finds herself in need of some desperate cash, so with the help of her friends, they coy up a plan, to rob a bank, so she can get the money she needs.The cast which includes the likes of, Marla Sokoloff, Marley Shelton, Mena Suvari and James Marsden are all quite good here.The movie itself was interesting, but it could of been a little better. And, at only 78 minutes long, the movie definitely could of been a bit longer. Sugar And Spice was still a good movie, and if you're into teen movies, then I'm sure you'll enjoy this one. I give Sugar And Spice a 7/10.

I didn't think it was terrible, yet I came out feeling dissatisfied.  Maybe I was in a bad mood.  Who knows?  Well, it was Free Preview Weekend on Starz, so I checked this movie out again.  And I watched it all three times they showed it.  This time I had a lot more fun!  Sugar and Spice is far from great, and is certainly no gem, but it's enjoyable teen fluff with some good laughs.  And let's face it, it centers on five sexy, scantily clad cheerleaders.  If you're a guy...how much more can you ask for?  This is the type of film that is made to satisfy both male and female viewers alike, kind of like Coyote Ugly.  The girls enjoy the dynamics of the female characters, the guys enjoy the beauty of the female characters.  This is not as sexy as Bring It On, but I'm still satisfied. The humor is sometimes lame and heavy-handed, and the characters are all caricatures, but I never reached the point where I wanted to croak.  The movie is overall pretty harmless.  And there are some funny moments, including one where Mena Suvari goes to visit her mother (Sean Young) in prison.  She asks her Mom for advice on robbing a bank.  Her Mom blushes and says, This is like asking me for help on your homework.  And I have to give this movie credit  the teen characters aren't as dumb as they are in most of these movies.  Sugar and Spice is cute, lightweight entertainment and enables you to see five hot babes in short skirts.  Sweet!

The whole situation is laughable when the team captain of the `A-Squad' cheerleaders at Lincoln High School is pregnant and what she does to make the situation more livable.James Marsden (Scott Summers/Cyclops in `X-Men') is the too-good-to-be-true boyfriend of Marley Shelton (Diane Weston in the film) whose innocence, sweetness and naivety makes you want to believe that there really are people like that in the real world.Mena Suvari (late of both `American Beauty' and `American `Pie') is a study in contrasts as the girl that `was born in prison.'  There has been a spate of cheerleader movies this last year &#150; but this one owes much more to `But I'm A Cheerleader' than it does to `Bring It On.'  There is a tension and sense of surrealism that isn't in `Bring It On.' When all the cheer leaders don their `Betty' masks it becomes very surrealistic &#150; almost spooky.There is no big opening to this film  just an introduction to the characters; but there is a nice end to the film &#150; explaining what happens to the major characters after the end of the film.I enjoyed this film much more than I thought I would &#150; give it a chance &#150; you may enjoy it too.

It is not, because it's not making fun of teens or teen movies, but has that slightly over the top smiley attitude that pushes you to that laughing place where you don't take things too seriously. Those who didn't like that movie didn't get that vibe. It is quite fun.Now, it's not a perfect movie, the subject matter is treated very lightly, but the story, the dialogs, and the characters are all very entertaining. It doesn't bring anything new, per se, to the table, but it does it with flair, and laughs. The girls are beautiful, but not plastic perfect. The acting is simple, but sincere and adorable in certain cases.One of the scene, when they announce they're getting married, is the perfect example of the quality and tone of the film. It and its followup scene in the car are hilarious.If you want to see a good little known teen flick with an adult mask, that would to it.

I was guilty of wanting to see it (hey any movie about cheerleaders that go on a crime spree has my vote of wanting to see it), but mostly because it seemed like it would be nevertheless enjoyable. Well, when sitting down to watch it I won't lie in saying that expecting it to JUST be enjoyable wasn't enough for me. I wanted to have the mind to like it (I love dark comedies, and especially ones they aren't afraid to poke fun at themselves), and you know what? I loved this movie.I will say the moment Sugar and Spice opened I leaned back in my seat, preparing myself to be disappointed. The movie has a very simple (yet perhaps appropriate) opening, and they immediately were jumping into story. Usually I don't fly with that, and even in this movie case I didn't immediately. Then when they started to crank up the cheer leading routines I thought Great, they have this great premise, but they're going to focus more on the cheer leading than the plot. Thankfully- they didn't. What made it start to click for me was the realization that all the characters were going to stay in character. I'm so glad they didn't do the typical cheerleader mean girl, but instead did poke fun at the dim witted head cheerleader (and football star), but keep them on that level where they don't become annoying, too over-the-top, but instead make them likable. This film was hilarious, and you love these girls so much that you want to see them prevail in their life of crime. You feel sympathy for these girls (in particular Marley Shelton's lead character, whom you want to see achieve the all American dream), and they're enjoyable to watch as they are to laugh with.Sure this movie has it's cutesy, almost implausible moments. Plus like I said this movie opened (and perhaps ended) very simple, and for that I wish this movie has been slightly longer. I'll admit that they sort of milked this story as far as it would go without starting to become annoying or TOO over-the-top where it becomes annoying, tiresome, or even embarrassing. The film is very funny, extremely enjoyable, and is a very dark treat.

The material was not rolling on the floor, laugh out loud hilarious, but it was enough to where you get tons of continuous little chuckles and I always had a smile on my face, always. That's why I loved this movie so much. It was able to make me grin and laugh all the way through at such little things, such as the Betty masks and whole robbery ordeal, and little lines and scenes, tons of which are through out the entire film.The performances were wonderful for their characters. Marla Sokoloff, Marley Shelton, Mena Suvari and James Marsden gave my favorite and most memorable performances of all, but everyone was memorable in their own, special way and I really just had an all out pleasurable experience with this joyous film and the joyous characters and essence it brings.In the end, as I've said, I had an amazing blast with Sugar & Spice. It was fun, fresh and though it's not for everyone, it certainly was for me, because I saw it as much more than most would for it's eccentric and zany sense that was very different in ways from other films of it's caliber. If you can enjoy films like these for what they are, try on Sugar & Spice for it is really just non-stop delight from start to finish with lovable characters and a screwball, surreal plot. I enjoyed it greatly.

The casting is perfect - Mena Suvari as Kansas and James Marsden as Jack are the standouts among an exceptional cast. This film is cheesy in the greatest way. I mean, it's about a high school cheerleading squad robbing a bank to fund the cheer captain's pregnancy! The characters are really well developed and are the driving force. They all have little aspects of them that make them unique and hilarious - I find Cleo's obsession with Conan O'Brien to be particularly funny. The film is narrated by a very snarky and obviously jealous B Squad (junior varsity) cheerleader. They do a good job of juxtaposing what she says with what is actually happening, but the lines blur a little as you get farther into the story and you start to wonder what to believe. It truly does have surprising little twists and turns, but nothing overwhelming. This is a great movie to just relax and watch with your friends or in a bubble bath or something. Witty, memorable, and ultimately a story of the power of female friendship and a satire of high school politics and stereotypes.

After watching 'Point Break', Diane has an unlikely idea. To get a gun, they have to include the criminal's daughter Fern Rogers (Alexandra Holden) in the squad.The movie is deliberately quirky. The problem is that the main cheerleaders are not that funny. They aren't comedians and fail to deliver the humor properly. Some of it works. The funniest potential is actually Sokoloff. She could be the overly paranoid, jealous and ambitious lead like Tracy Flick in 'Election'. This movie has a great idea on the surface but fails to deliver the laughs.

Shelton is well cast as the pregnant ditz out to secure her future in the most illegal fashion possible. Marla Sokoloff narrates her anger when refused on the cheerleading squad.

For instance it delayed till the end of its first half to hit its point of attack (the idea of the heist) to have us for quite some time watching just the problem which led to that !. Plus, what's the need for an extra girl (the daughter of the weapons' dealer) where she did nothing to the story or the comedy ??, or what's the need for free nasty scenes like the big black worker woman at the prison who looks lustfully to the young girls' short skirts ??!! Actually I suspect also how the 2 minutes of where are they now? part was added just to lengthen the movie's running time which's originally a 73 minutes long only. Let alone how its third act (the robbery itself) wasn't as hot and ironic as it should have been. However, it's fresh comedy, with smart conflict where the unexpected always happens. The cast was totally cute and comic with great sense of humor to mock scornfully at the teen girls. The hidden satire gives it a little deepness that could make it live longer; you must rob to survive, the perfect role models aren't that perfect after all, and it even shows how the dirty money financed the politicians, or how the politicians themselves can be so dull (to have a gang's head as a wife, and know nothing about it !). It's a good little crime comedy that assured how the unfair society must be robbed, and how the teen polished girls can plan and achieve the perfect crime. It looks like some revenge on anyone ever sees that girls are weak or less intelligent than men. No wonder I suppose, since it came from 2 girls already  director Francine McDougall, and scriptwriter Lona Williams (Mandy Nelson is an alias Williams used). (Williams) is the one who wrote (Drop Dead Gorgeous) 2 years earlier, where she illustrated how the girls got sugar and bad spice, here she clarified the existence of the good spice anyway.

It is very funny and also captures many aspects of life. For the guys, there are six really hot girls (Rachel Blancard, Melissa George, Mena Suvari, Marley Shelton, Alexandra Holden, and Marla Sokoloff) and one okay looking one (Sara Marsh). And there is James Marsden (X-Men Cyclops) for the ladies.  I don't really see why people seem to compare this Bring It On, as this was not only made before that film, but it is much, much better. I know I, for one, cared about what happened to all of these characters more than I did for anyone in Bring It On. (I did like Kirsten in Spidey, though.) A sort of sad thing about this movie, though, is that it does seem to be somewhat heavily cut. Indeed, a half an hour or so seems be missing. Granted, it is still a great film as is, but I think it is too bad that the other footage was cut (probably because of Columbine like things) and I would like to see it, possibly on a future expanded DVD. Another thing I like about the movie is that a good friend of mine is an extra, as it was made in the area we live in.    All in all, a great film!

The characters were fun as well as the entire movie.  I feel the soundtrack was fun as well with some cool rock & roll tunes.  I bought both the movie on DVD and the soundtrack on CD and would recommend this movie to anyone who has not aborted their sense of humor and can just leave the critical part of the brain at the doorstep and just watch a movie for the fun of it.  We can all pick things to pieces with critical thinking but this is not that kind of movie.  Very few movies involving teenagers and adults can put a story together that tries not to be condescending or serious for either generation and that's what makes this unique satire such a hidden gem.  If you haven't seen this movie but like movies that are fun just for the sake of being fun then this movie is for you!About the movie  The entire movie is told in retrospect by a second string (B Squad) cheerleader named Lisa (Marla Sokoloff).  The movie starts with Lisa at the police station looking at a lineup of suspected Bank robbers she witnessed.  The bank robbers are the A Cheerleader Squad Team.  The captain of the A Team is Diane Weston (Marley Shelton) whom upon meeting a new boy Jack Bartlett (James Marsden) the new football quarterback, gets an instant crush on him and then is asked to the Prom dance by him.  They fall in love and she gets pregnant.  After being rejected by their parents they find a dump of an apartment and make the best of it.  While the A team is at Diane's watching Point Break it occurs to Diane how she can get the money she needs for her family-to-be.  MONEY, money can give you what you want?  They can rob a bank?  After a few moments they go hands in on the deal and make a pact with each other.  Each watch a movie like Reservoir Dogs and Dog Day Afternoon and Heat as well as The Apple Dumpling Gang by one of the girls who's from a Christian home who can only watch G movies.  They make a practice run by stealing the schools lunch money and build a little self-confidence.  The bank robbery looks like a combination of all the movies they had watched.  If you want to see how it ends then you just have to watch it.  If you like looking at pretty girls then this is a pleasing movie for this as well.  When the movie was made the girls actual ages ranged from Mena Suvari being the youngest at age 21 and Marley Shelton being the oldest at age 26,  The girls all pull off playing teenage girls quite convincingly and appear to have all had fun making this movie and working with each other.  If I had any gripe at all it would be that the soundtrack for this movie did not include several songs heard in the movie and the soundtrack is only 36.5 minutes so it's not like there wasn't room on the CD.  Anyway, watch the movie and have fun.

For the majority of the film, it sounds like her testimony is intended to indict the six cheerleaders who pulled off the robbery.  However, at the end we find out that head cheerleader Diane made a deal with Lisa, so that she would provide their alibi.  Since it was Lisa's evidence that made them suspects in the first place, why would they believe she would change her story?  According to her testimony, they were sitting in her car in the parking lot while the store was robbed, and they were still there when she came out.  If that were the case, she would never had thought to suspect them, cheerleader-type dismount or no.  Also, if the deal was made before the testimony, as it would have to be, she would have nothing to gain by telling the story of Diane's financial problems, Kansas' convict mother, etc.  It also makes little sense, since she was not present for most of the scenes in the film.  It's like her story is an afterthought, since the point of view for the film is REALLY Diane.Basically, whatever the flaws of the films, and there were others, nothing sinks this film more than a weak, illogical narrative device.

Combine Heathers (1989) and Set It Off (1996) with last year's blockbuster Bring It On, and you've got a good idea what cinematic heights Sugar and Spice aspires to but never scales. This cute but contrived black comedy about gun-toting high school cheerleaders that knock off a supermarket branch bank fares better as an audacious social satire that eviscerates its perpetually sunny pep squad protagonists than an as amoral but amusing crime caper applauding amateurs that beat the system. Essentially, apart from its devilishly gritty girl-gab and occasional insights into angst-ridden teen dilemmas, Sugar and Spice pours on too much sugar and not nearly enough spice. Although audiences may guffaw at the felonious antics of these heroines, the conspicuous but incompatible 'crime pays' message repudiates the picture's light-headed lampoonery. The consequences of promiscuous behavior beget criminal conduct, and Sugar & Spice surprisingly endorses both as legitimate while it ridicules authority figures.Our amiable heroines are five anorexic airheads who comprise the cheerleading A-team at Lincoln High School. Diane (Marley Shelton) captains this elite squad that consists of Cleo (Melissa George), Kansas (Mena Suvari of American Beauty), Hannah (Rachel Blanchard of The Brady Bunch movies), and Lucy (Sara Marsh). So tightly knit is this gaggle that they get their monthly visit from Aunt Rose at the same time. The terminally optimistic Diane literally flips head over heels for hunky new football quarterback Jack Bartlett (X-Men's James Marsden) at their first pep rally. Accidentally, she kicks him in the head, and they fall hopelessly in love. Unfortunately, Jack gets Diane pregnant. When the elated couple informs their folks, their stunned parents show them the door and give them the boot. Later, when foul-mouthed Kansas suggests she abort her unborn twins, Diane refuses.Jack and Diane apply for a bank loan but are flatly rejected, so they take jobs during after- school hours. Jack gets fired from a couple of fast-food restaurants before two nerds at Lincoln High who tend register at a local video store hire him if he will share his girl-getting secrets. Meanwhile, Diane works at a grocery store bank. They rent a cruddy apartment and struggle to make ends meet on minimum-hour wages. Sadly, Diane concludes the Beatles lied; people need more than love to survive. The mastermind of the bunch, Diane proposes they rob a bank, so the gals study old heist capers, chiefly Heat, Point Break, and Reservoir Dogs. Eventually, they decide you can learn more about sex than robberies from Hollywood.First-time director Francine McDougall and scenarist Mandy Nelson have more fun skewering their stereotypically ditzy cheerleader protagonists than weaving an engaging, suspenseful yarn about the trials and tribulations of modern-day crime from a teen perspective. Imaginatively, they frame the story around Lisa's confession to the FBI, paying homage to those film noir thrillers from the 1940s and 1950s. Sugar and Spice turns incredibly sour during its final quarter-hour with a message as morally bankrupt as its improbable, anti-climactic ending. Pallid plotting and half-baked humor blunt the edge of Nelson's flaky satire. Characters behave not only inconsistently but also unrealistically. Further, the level of toxic sarcasm required to bolster this black comedy is woefully missing. Clocking in at less than 90 minutes, this saucy but superficial satire stimulates interest as an off-beat example of social commentary that rewards its protagonists for illegal acts that Hollywood usually condemns hands down. (Anybody remember the equally subversive Idle Hands whee marihuana was used to destroy the demoniac forces of evil?) Had the comedy been as compelling as the commentary, Sugar & Spice might have been more naughty than nice.

You have to feel for them though. What is a studio to do with a movie that overtly makes fun of the exact same audience they expect will throw down money to see it?  This is the audience - the A-group high school jocks and cheerleaders - that movies usually shamelessly suck up to.  You also have to feel for the A-group teens who got blind sighted by it.  I would have loved to have seen it in the theater and looked around as they shifted in their seats, suddenly uncomfortable at seeing the values they hold dear held up to ridicule.  If you don't like it, I suspect  it hit a little to close to home. This is not at all a `cheerleader movie`, folks.Marla Sokoloff narrates as Lucy, I mean Lisa, the cute embittered B-squad cheerleader who relishes in spilling to the cops all she knows about the A-squad, (just arrested for armed robbery).  The first few minutes of the film are an absolute riot as Lisa introduces us to the girls (we first officially meet them as they step out of the bathroom stalls after sharing a box of tampons), the school and the inevitable relationship between the new jock and head cheerleader (They're such a cute couple everybody swoons).  The script is top-notch filled with pop culture jabs and juxtaposing timely current event issues onto the teen movie cliches.  In it's best moments it's reminiscent of Alexander Payne's brilliant Election (check out the Homecoming King speech scene or the way the video store geeks droll over a Paul Metzler-type James Marsden). Sokoloff's narration is filled with as much bite, insight and venom as Christina Ricci's in The Opposite of Sex.  Get ready to remember some great quotes.  Sokoloff herself plays against type wonderfully and gets to show more range than previous roles have allowed.  The movie takes a slight dip as her narration fades away and the girls take over the story. The cheerleaders, including Marley Shelton and Mena Suvari, play their 1-note stereotypes to a T.  Beyond making some hilarious quips and quirks (Conan O'Brien obsession anyone?) they are all appropriately kept at a distance - for if they became real people and the movie started relating to them the satire would be blown. The music is bubbly and appropriate but nothing really distinct.  The ending is a huge cheat. The filmmakers chose the easiest and most obvious way out and it's a let down to the messages and characters. Had they done something more imaginative we could have had a really great movie here.  However, it's almost made up for by the end title character wrap up which is, I must say, nearly brilliant.  All in all, fun and funny. Highly recommended for those likely to get it.

Decent premise, but not enough for a full-length movie. Even at 80 minutes the film feels long (also paying $9.00 for an 80 minute movie is ridiculous). The script is unfunny and obvious--although I did laugh out loud a few times. Also the entire cast is way too old to be playing high school---James Marsden (Jack) is 27! The pluses are a good soundtrack and a cast all giving 100% to their roles. Especially good is Marsden--all grinning and full of charm and energy. Still, it isn't enough. It's boring and silly.

Unfortunately, it wasn't half as funny as I thought it would be. The funniest parts were definitely mostly shown in the trailer (and even they weren't *that* funny).  Parts of it seemed to linger too much on the dumb cheerleader stereotype.. So much so that it became too dumb to be funny.At the beginning of the movie the characters were introduced and the audience was given some background information about them.  Although the idea may have seemed good on paper, the timing was definitely wrong.  I found that the information given wasn't of any use to me, as it came too soon to process.  After that brief introduction, the character development seemed to stop and just revolve around the cheesy romance of the two main characters.  I felt like the whole movie was about getting through the plot in the allotted time space.As I said in the beginning, the script had potential.  Unfortunately, it just wasn't written in the right way.  It could have been so much funnier. I'd give it a two out of five stars for the attempt.

The movie isn't so concerned with the cheerleaders themselves as it is with the classic what if? scenario of the captain of the squad becoming impregnated by the captain of the football team.  And where to go from there?  Why, rob a bank, of course.  They have the finesse, they have the ability and, most of all, they have the grooviest disguises (All-American Dolls) since the Ex-Presidents in Point Break.What stood out is the performance of Mary Shelton in the role of Diane, the cheerleader captain and mastermind.  She does a wonderful job of keeping a positive attitude when her life starts to crumble around her.  And, as her polar opposite, James Mardsen does a great job of portraying the clueless jock Jack.  Mardsen has cluelessness done to a T, especially when failing to realize the stigma of having to work at a video store.  While it's nice to see that the stereotypes are not being limited to just the popular people, is it really necessary to have them at all?The rest of the squad, however, only fall into the aforementioned stereotypes.  The cast does their best to overcome them, but there are only so many cheerleader jokes you can do in a feature.  Mena Suvari does look like she's having fun, though, as the bad girl cheerleader.  And Rachel Blanchard does look pretty as the morally upright cheerleader.When the robbery comes, it's almost a non-event.  But it does come with quite a few laughs.  What the film needed to show more of is the aftermath. How does it affect their lives immediately after?  Sure, there's a recap at the end, but it would have been better to see those events unfold than to just read about them.  Maybe New Line didn't like the first cut of the film and had it pared.  Given the 83 minute running time, that is likely.However, this is the best film with a January release date since Jackie Chan's First Strike.  The photography is arid yet striking.  The cast is game, the screenplay does have some great laugh out loud moments and it's nice to see a film that shows the many uses of cheerleader athletics.

The original script (Sugar & Spice & Submachineguns) had many parts toned down intentionally because of the overriding high school violence in the United States.  Saying that, there sadly isn't enough of the script left to produce a compelling movie.The premise of a gang of high school cheerleaders pulling off bank robberies is fresh and intriguing concept.  However, this concept isn't taken farther than one rather horrible attempt at robbery. It would be interesting to see this plot device expanded on.The acting isn't what it could of been either, with the young actors in this release confined to typical cookie cutter roles.  The two dimensional writing is apparent form the opening credits that show the characters names and their titles within the Gang.The only interesting sub-plot is that of teen pregnancy.  And once again this isn't taken far enough to become compelling or even worth thinking about.Finally this movie isn't even a good Cheerleader movie!  It isn't an exciting bank robbing movie!  And it is quite hard to actually care about the characters in this movie.Out of a possible five plugs i would like to give Sugar & Spice one plug, just for trying, but i can't.

Melissa George, Mena Suvari (AMERICAN BEAUTY), Rachel Blanchard and Alexandra Holden also give solid support.  The only weak link is  Marla Sokoloff as the squad's nemesis. Even with her work, she barely registers compared with the other girls. Also, the film is slightly marred by an abrupt, though reasonably plausible (for a satirical farce) ending, `Sugar and Spice' delivers the goods.

Girls went to see the film since it was a girls story, guys went to go see it since it showed girls shakin' their charms.  Now imagine BRING IT ON, just more darker and a bit more humorous, and it's called SUGAR & SPICE.  And quoting one of the other user comments, it's not bad for a January release.      SUGAR & SPICE's story is told by the very jealous Lisa (Marla Sokoloff) as she is speaking to federal agents.  Lisa is on the second squad of the cheerleaders, and has been overlooked for so many years.  Her peers known as the 'A' squad are popular, smart, and pretty.  Then when a new quarterback moves into town, Jack Bartlett (James Marsden), Lisa and the rest of the female students have a crush on him, even the cafeteria lunch ladies!  But Jack has his eye on Diane Weston (Marley Shelton) who made a strong impression when meeting Jack, by doing flips and accidently kicking Jack in the face.  When they see eye to eye, it's love at first sight, which leds to dating for homecoming, and Diane announcing that she is pregnant with Jack's baby, and they are getting married.  But in order to get married, Jack and Diane need to live on their own.  They can't get any bank loans, and not being a high school graduate yet, Jack can only get evening jobs at either fast food restraunts or Video Update with geeky clerks.  Diane takes a job as a bank teller at the brach adjacent to a grocery store.  And it's one evening when Diane along with her cheerleader friends are watching POINT BREAK, that Diane gets an idea that her squad should rob the bank and get the money.  There's Kansas (Mena Suvari) who is the rebellious cheerleader, she speaks her mind and is sort of the leader of the squad.  Kansas goes to the state prison and gets bank robbing advice from her mom, Mrs. Hill (Sean Young, with no make-up).  Then Cleo (a very hot and beautiful Melissa George) who is the glamorous member, who is the only girl who doesn't have a crush on Jack, because she has a crush on Conan O' Brien!  Lucy (Sara Marsh) is the brains behind the group who gives second thoughts to this robbery fearing that it will cost her the Harvard scholarship that she's working on.  And Hannah (Rachel Blanchard) is the religous zealot who is very worried about doing the heist for both parental and religious reasons.  The girls watch classic heist movies to learn the film character's mistakes, that way they won't make the same mistakes.  Classic crime movies like RESIVOR DOGS, HEAT (1995), and APPLE DUMPLING GANG are the films watched for homework.  Can the girls pull off the heist and not get caught, or will Lisa, who witnessed the heist will give the girls identification away to get on the 'A' squad?      I found SUGAR & SPICE to be a surprise!  It was very funny and enjoyable.  It's the kind of movie that doesn't praise or show the excitement of the teenage life like CAN'T HARDLY WAIT, CRUEL INTENTIONS, or SHE'S ALL THAT.  Na, instead it makes fun of it, the dopey personality of Jack.  The crush on a major celebrity of Cleo, the loud mouth and vulgar Kansas, the religious worried Hannah, and the constantly studying Lucy.  These are the characteristics of modern teens, not who's going to take me to homecoming? or will I win that boy's affection?  I knew more cheerleaders in high schoollike the ones featured in SUGAR & SPICE, than BRING IT ON, or other teen flicks.        The humor in it is quite clever.  A example would be Jack's job at Video Update, where he works with two teenage geeky clerks.  They hire Jack because of his popularity at school, and they also want to hear his sex stories with Diane.  It's like a twisted version of SHE'S ALL THAT when you think about it, but it's more realistic.  And the robbery scene at the bank is without a doubt the funniest bank robbery since George Clooney did his in OUT OF SIGHT.        And the acting is also done very well, all of the girls do a good job playing teenage cheerleaders, when all of them are old enough to legally drink!  I personaly enjoyed Melissa George, her character crush on Conan was quite funny, and did I mention how beautiful she was?  I also enjoy the dim-witted performance of James Marsden who proves that he's a good actor, after being Cyclops in X-MEN, he can show his acting talent even further.      SUGAR & SPICE is a enjoyable dark comedy, it's the kind of movie that people who already graduated high school would enjoy.  That's because teens in high school now won't get the jokes since they either act like that, know people like that, or it's too witty for them.  But for those who remember the wanna be's, the pretty girls, and the idiots in school, SUGAR & SPICE is a treat!

As an American journalist wrote about Stephen J. Cannell, the only real similarity between Baa Baa Black Sheep and The Greatest American Hero is that both shows involve flying.That said, this movie is still the lesser one. One of the problems are that writer Mandy Nelson and director Francine McDougall don't seem too sure about what kind of tone it should have; it seems to want to be darker but can't summon up the nerve, its characters veer from one-note (particularly Cleo, the Conan O'Brien obsessive) to semi-real (Diane, the cheerleader captain whose unwed mother plight launches the plot), and having the movie be narrated in flashback by a rival rule-obsessed girl suggests we'll be seeing it from her POV, but it's not until some way into the story that she actually plays any kind of a role.The movie's intentionally uncomfortable to watch, but also never especially funny - and it doesn't help that with the exception of Alexandra Holden as Fern, most of the cast aren't too believable as teenagers (and why do so many of them have first or last names that begin with the letter M? Marla Sokoloff, Marley Shelton, Melissa George who, incidentally, I thought was playing Diane until the credits set me right, Mena Suvari, Sara Marsh...). It passes the time, and at least it's short - and give the makers credit for not trying to gloss over problems of young couples - but Kirsten Dunst and Eliza Dushku are ultimately the short-skirt-wearers of choice in this milieu.Sugar & Spice could have used more of both parts of its title.

In fact, it got more laughs than the initial `American Pie' screening I attended. Written by Mandy Nelson (`Drop Dead Gorgeous'), it's got enough one-liners and sight gags to keep the most ADD of us interested. It's about an obnoxiously sweet high school couple named Jack and Diane. Jack (James Mardsen of `X-Men') is great as a naïve star quarterback and she's the leader of a group of hot cheerleaders whose lives are turned around when Diane (Marley Shelton of The Bachelor') gets pregnant. Disowned by their respective parents, they attempt to work through it by getting jobs only high schoolers and bored senior citizens would take while living in a ghetto fabulous apartment. Finally losing her upbeat attitude, Diane gets her cheerleader friends (including the beautiful Mena Suvari of `American Beauty') in on a plot to rob the bank she works at to give her family a better life. She is almost foiled by Lisa (Marla Sokoloff of `Whatever It Takes'), a jealous wannabe who would love nothing more than to break into her clique. They study heist scenes from `Point Break' and `Reservoir Dogs' for inspiration as the climax leads them into the bank in full all-American doll costumes. The only real flaw is the obvious attempt by the director (Francine McDougall, a documentary filmmaker) to be like Amy Heckerling (`Fast Times at Ridgemont High', `Loser'). Originally called `Sugar and Spice and Semiautomatics (a better title for the film!)', this would make a great renal, but you wouldn't feel totally ripped off if you go to the theatre. And with a running time of just over 80 minutes, you won't feel like you've wasted any time there either.

SPOILER ALERT","Date":"13 August 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":"  When I first saw the trailers for Sugar & Spice, I deffinetly did not want to see it.  I thought it was just going to be a bunch of ditzy cheerleaders robbing a bank, similar to the comedy Airheads, starring Brendan Fraiser. So I didn't go see it.  So one night at blockbuster by dance-fanatic sister decided that she was going to pick the movies.  She took Cast Away, Remember the Titans (two of which were excellent movies).......and Sugar and Spice. So I ended up watching it.  I was wrong to judge the trailers.Ok, so yeah, I was thinking of the funny and cheesy film Bring it On when I first saw the previews of Sugar and Spice.  What I got was a cool, original, and funny comedy about cheerleaders robbing a bank.  On the back of the videocassette cover, I saw the plot summary and I thought it was going to be terrible.  Supposedly, the cheerleaders where going to rob a bank and they have to make it on time for the big game. That does sound cheesy, right?The plot summary is actually this  Lisa (Marla Sokoloft), a cheerleader from the B squad of Lincoln High, narrates to a bunch of police the whole story of the A squad, which she is totally jealous of.  The A squad have always been like sisters.  The captain is Diane (Marla Shelton), then there are the other ones, Kansas (Mena Suvari), Cleo, Hannah and Lucy.  Diane falls for Jack (James Marsden), and they are both in deep love.  On the homecoming dance, Jack asks Diane to marry him in front of their parents, and Diane says that they will, after they have their baby.  This causes major shock for their parents, so they are kicked out of their homes and forced to have a home of their own.  Now, things aren't going very well. Diane's pregnancy is getting hectic, and her friends are really trying to help out.  So one day they decide to rob a bank to get money.  After all, money is all they need to make their dreams come true.Mena Suvari is hilarious as the rebel cheerleader.  Cleo is obssessed with Conan O'Brian.  Lucy is the smart cheerleader and she is afraid that she will lose her scholarship if she robs the bank.  Hannah is very christian and does her best to help out. While preparing for the heist, the girls need guns, so they go to a bug exterminator that happens to sell guns.  They can't afford them though, so they promise to bring the exterminator's daughter Fern on the A squad.  Fern is very skinny and she is sweet.  Marla Shelton does a great job at portraying Dianne, in a funny pregnant cheerleader kind of way.  James Marsden is good as the always-optimistic dad.The whole experience of Sugar & Spice is actually very surprising and unpredictable.  The screenplay is very good, and so is the choreography, even though there aren't too many cheerleading cheers here, just a bunch of cool characters who are very unique, trying to help a friend.  There aren't to many beautiful people, because this isn't a usual teenage comedy. Actually, there aren't any stereotypes, and this is a relief for everyone.This film was deffinetly underrated because this is a unique comedy.  No ariheads, no stereotypes, and no dumb humor.  It might be called brainless comedy, though.  After all, this is cheerleaders robbing a bank.  But it's not brainless comedy like in Dude, Where's my Car.  Dude, Where's my Car was just plain stupidity.  Sugar & Spice was actually very effective as a brainless comedy, and it deffinetly made my top 5 of best comedies of 2001.  Actually, there aren't a lot of comedies made for 2001.  Saving Silverman was excellent, and so was this.  Ok, so it's one of 2 best comedies of this year.Needless to say, rent or buy Sugar and Spice right now.  It's worth your money and the 1 h 24 minutes in your VCR.  Trust Me.  You'll love the characters, but you'll love the idea even more.8.5/10 (Excellent Comedy) "},{"Title":"Annoying lead characters despite a good idea","Date":"28 July 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":"  While having a group of teenage cheerleaders rob a bank is an interesting and different idea, this satire's one major flaw is its character writing. Kansas (Mena Suvari) and Lisa were the only characters that came across as believable. The leads, Jack & Diane (named for the John Mellancamp song?), are star quarterback and head cheerleader respectively, yet their characters are merely airheads living a gooberful life. James Marsden, who plays Jack, portrays his role well when compared to his big role as the serious, pragmatic Cyclops in X-Men. Moreover, the characters who fill the roles of the brain and the Christian girl are completely antithetical with what they are supposed to be.All in all, while this film has a good plot, good satire, and plenty of sexy gals (*sigh* Mena&#133;), the characters are annoying and completely distracting.
