[{"Title":"One of Mickey Rourke's best performances in a darkly funny film","Date":"15 January 2006","Score":"50 out of 57 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Barfly was a fairly successful film when it was released and garnered generally favorable reviews. Roger Ebert gave it four out of four, and along with Angel Heart, it helped solidify 1987 as the Year of Mickey Rourke.However, almost twenty years later it isn't talked so much about anymore, and I feel it deserves to be. Rourke gives one of his finest performances as Henry, a loner who walks hunched over like the Hunchback of Notre Dame. Henry works at a bar as a runner - delivering orders and such. But he's always getting into drunken brawls with the bartender, usually losing.One day Henry's life takes a turn when he meets a downtrodden woman (Faye Dunaway) and they embark on a relationship.Barfly is a great film. Rourke was vocal later on in his career about his dislike of director Barbet Schroeder, but Schroeder's direction is part of what makes this film so good.However, the absolute best aspect of the movie is Rourke's performance. Embodying the late writer Charles Bukowski (whose work this was based upon, and who had a brief cameo in the film), Rourke is unrecognizable - like Billy Bob Thornton in Sling Blade, his entire demeanor and physicality seems to change.I highly recommend Barfly - it's funny, dark, witty, touching and downright enjoyable. One of the best films of the '80s.

Mickey Rourke is excellent as Henry Chinaski, a writer and habitue of skid row who isn't so much slumming as soaking in it. The real surprise here is Faye Dunaway as his love interest it's easily her best performance since Chinatown and proves she still has it.

A great picture. That's what we can say. A friend of mine recommended Barfly to me. I watched the start and it said Some people never go crazy, what truly horrible lives they must live! After that I was hooked, I knew this guy Bukowski wrote from the gut. I bought as many Bukowski books as possible. Pulp, Hollywood, and Women (my favourite!). I like his novels and short stories more than the poetry. But some of the poems are intense! The movie is also excellent. The two leads are great-Faye Dunaway is in high acting form here. So is Mickey Roarke who seems to have gotten under Bukowski's skin for the role......a side note he did the movie sober! This movie is directed by Barbet Schroeder who also did Reversal of Fortune. He also made the 4 hour Charles Bukowski Tapes (which I own) and it is good, but way too long! Bukowski drinks and reads poems. Back to the film-good supporting actors in this one. The beautiful Alice Krige (from Haunted Summer) is in this as well as David Lynch regular Jack Nance. Lynch was actually on set one day. Bukowski has a funny cameo a barfly in the bar where Mickey meets Faye. I heard that Dennis Hopper wanted to direct this and have Sean Penn star. Schroeder fought hard for it though. Hopper states Schroeder couldn't direct traffic! I guess he proved him wrong. Schroeder went into a production office with a power saw and threatened to cut off his pinky finger if they didn't put more funding into the film. Obviously a labour of love. So check it out if you can, the writing is top notch stuff.......Highly recommended. Thanx.

As a matter of a fact, I often find it the downfall of some biopics, where the physicality may be captured, but the meat and potatoes of the character's are often left by the wayside. Not so in the instance of Barfly. Rourke nailed Bukowski/Chinaski's crazy, alcoholic, free spiritedness brilliantly, I felt. There was a humor, a tenderness, a coldness, a twisted romanticism, and a bleakness, all wrapped into a greasy, overweight (Rourke pulled a De Niro, gaining weight and not bathing months before the film's shooting) package you could almost smell from the theater seats.Faye Dunaway as the aging, sad, beautiful barfly Wanda, gives a performance that yet again reminds us why she is a cinematic legend in her own time! She plays the subtleties and intricacies of Wanda with such aplomb, offering even this - the most pathetic of her roles - a dignity and a sad beauty that not many actresses can pull off.The casting of this film deserves a round of applause! I've tended bar and worked in the sorts of joints where these all too real people can be found, and I felt as if I was right there again, pouring shots of bourbon, polishing glasses, and making certain that the brawls boiling in the bar get taken to the streets. Frank Stallone's swaggering, bully-of-a-bar tender, macho-man Eddie is hilarious! Gloria LeRoy as Grandma Moses the ancient prostitute infamous for her ability to swallow paste is priceless. I could go on and on, but I won't! Bukowski's male character counterpart is a macho, beer swilling, bare knuckle fighting, farting kind of man who some may not appreciate, considering that outside of the seedier bars in North America, these types of fellas are a dying breed. With males being force-fed the over-sensitive, turn the other cheek, annoyingly metro sexual kinds of roles models and ideals these days, it must be a strange look back over the evolutionary shoulder for some men to see the realities of people like Bukowski! Don't get me wrong - I'm not applauding all of the Chinaski character's behaviors, but I think that some guys could learn a thing or two about themselves from the worst example of the diametric opposite of what they've been told they should be. Sometimes a fight has to be - sometimes it's just plain pathetic, and both examples can be found in Barfly.Bukowski has always dared to put to page whatever entered his head, and did so with a twisted lovely flourish.Barbet Schroeder, the man behind such brilliant and critically acclaimed films such as More (1969), his work with director as Jean-Luc Godard, his contribution to French Nouvelle Vague or New Wave cinema, and his more mainstream flicks such as Single White Female, places him in a category above many directors working in North America today.With Barfly, Schroeder captures the gritty realities of lives given over to the excesses of substances and circumstances in a true-to-life way, as he did with his first film More, a flick about heroin addiction done at a time when the subject was still considered very taboo. The musical score for Barfly supports this film perfectly, too, with the Hammond organ whirling out Booker T. Jones' Hip Hug Her as we P.O.V. our way through the film's first scene, past the bar sign, to the bar's door, and into the world of Henry Chinaski. This is all counter-pointed wonderfully by the use of Mozart and Beethoven under Rourke's voice-overs of Chinaski's writing.To sum it all up - as much as I dig and respect Bukowski, I have to say that even though he wasn't a fan of the flick (long after its release I may add, and he was on set as an adviser and unaccredited cast member - why didn't he say something at the time?), I look at this movie as a wee gem and as a masterpiece daring enough to capture life's underbelly with an acuteness and accuracy many wouldn't dare to put to screen.~T.Paulwww.t-paul.com "},{"Title":"A NICE ONE!","Date":"20 August 2002","Score":"18 out of 21 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Perhaps Mickey Rourkes' final great performance, BARFLY sees him as  prolific writer/poet Henry Chinaski who rejects conformity in every day society and believes it to be frustratingly fake. As a result, he is a drunk, and prefers to hang out with 'all his friends' in a regular bar by getting into fights whilst the crowd pays the winner (no guesses as to what he spends his money on) until he meets a 'strange girl' at a bar- Wanda (Faye Dunway). The two instantly click- both are intelligent indivuals who reject over regularity in every day passive conversation (Dunaway- 'I hate people, don't you? Rourke- 'I don't mind them, but I seem to feel better when they're not around'). The two form an instant freindship/relationship because of one major primary function that can keep them together- drink. A researcher who picks up talented writers like Henry enters the frame and falls for him due to his prolific writing and offers him a place in 'the good life' with her- but Henry rejects this when she tells him he will 'grow into it' (Rourke- growing is for plants- I hate roots).BARFLY manages to do something profound that so many films fail to do- in showing us that conformity isn't suited to intelligent, open minded creative individuals like Henry. Rourke excels himself in this role, it's as good a performance but a completely different one from his role in ANGEL HEART (starring in 3 great films, including RUMBLE FISH, really doesn't do him justice- he was the best of his generation in the 80's). He plays Henry not unlike how Jeff Bridges plays Jeffrey 'The Dude' Lebowski in THE BIG LEBOWSKI (I'd be very surprised if the  Coens didn't take inspiration from this film, and fans of that particular film should also check this out) as some one who you would consider to be an every day loser but is probably a darn sight more smarter than you believe them to be (as well as having a self serving purpose for the life they have chosen to live). Faye Dunaway, as usual, is uniformly excellent as Henrys lover/drinking partner, managing to convey an aura of sassiness and casual sophistication, and who has also chosen to take this particular path in life for a reason- the same as Henry's. The chemistry between these two leads is astounding, and the script is pitch perfect with dozens of memorable lines (Dunway- 'Whatever happens, don't expect me to fall in love with you', Rourke- 'That's ok, nobody has ever fallen in love with me anyway'). To me at least, Rourke's performance as Henry is the single most likeable character created in any film, and it stays with you long after the film is over. Touching, funny and profound- a minor masterpiece, a 'nice' film, I RECOMMEND IT!

Even the bar where Henry normally hangs out at, The Golden Horn, has the same dreary, smoke-filled atmosphere that you'd find at any tavern, bar, or pub.  A fitting tribute to anyone who goes to any bar.That part of the movie that works wonders is the camera work of Robby Muller (To Live and Die in L.A., Ghost Dog Way of the Samurai), that captures the typical scene in a bar.

Experiencing Barfly is like finding a jewel in a trash can or meeting Scarlett Johansen alone in a cheap motel room...Mickey Rourke, portrays Henry Chinaski, a barfly buzzing around from a waterhole A to a waterhole B. For the bartenders, among them Eddy, the one he fights every night, Henry is a real pain in the ass, how ironic that he also walks as if he had one. And with his Brando-like eyes, Henry seems to look at both nowhere and everywhere, ignoring but understanding the real world with real as the derogatory synonym of obviousness, dullness, hypocrisy ... and when he meets Faye Dunaway (no wire hangers this time, but some priceless hangovers I guarantee) it's the perfect cocktail of cynical poetry and endearing trashiness served to you, on the rocks. Still this is the only alcoholic experience that doesn't leave you with a bitter taste in your mouth, for the film is so wasted you wish you could have wasted more time watching it.The movie is written by Charles Bukowski, one of the most original authors of the last century, a man who gave to the trashiest and lowest life of American streets the letters of an inner nobility that no one could see, except the unfortunate (or were they?) misfits who belonged to that gripping underworld. I wish I could have said that from my readings of some Bukowski's poems or novels, but it's been my whole life since I just knew about this man, and if one thing, Barfly is my first immersion in the world of this poet who stinks the sweet perfume of truth and not the one that awakens some repressed suicidal tendencies through a solemn voice over. In Barfly, truth is delivered through Henry's nasal voice with a musicality singing that life is too serious to be taken seriously &#x85; and the genius of the script is how unpretentiously but seriously hilarious it is.You literally savor the script like a sweet, red and juicy appetizer, starting with the most significant quote, the film's tag-line Some people never go crazy &#x85; what truly horrible lives they must live! Henry is not right because it's naturally better to be crazy, his sentence exceeds his own personal comprehension of craziness, the point is not to be crazy like Henry, but the way we'd love to be every once in a while. The taste of life differs from one person to another. Henry's nonsense speaks true statements about human nature with the same lucidity that governs our hearts when we've just taken one drop too much. Realization is the first step in the road for wisdom while most of us resist to the blinding flash of realization, Henry can't think of what he wants to be, because he's already too tired of thinking of what he doesn't want to be. Henry subtly mirrors our condition as people who not only know but actually ARE what they don't want to be.Henry can do nothing but drink, sleep, fight and write... still, he's not a loser, hell, how can you be a loser if you've got nothing to lose? The rest of his life consists on a bunch of can't but aware, he is, and care, he doesn't; while our masochistic registration to a mediocre formula of life deprived us from the same kind of free-spirited awareness. We try to forget our condition by reassuring ourselves with an ersatz of normality, just to be accepted by the boring majority. Anyone can get a job. It takes a man to make it without working. Henry's eternal drunkenness injected in his brains an extraordinary view on life so insightful and pertinent, he's the kind of modern prophet you'd constantly wonder what he'd think about anything. And one thing for sure, you'd trade the three quarters of your Facebook friends for one night where you could cheer with Henry, while he raises his glass of scotch and shouts To my friends! And that's the true spirit of Barfly, it doesn't trash your life and talks to you in a patronizing way, it doesn't tease your brains, again it doesn't take itself seriously. That's what cruelly lacks in today's films, I'd rather watch a movie where a bunch of true losers are having a good time than a bunch of dangerous losers creating a sort of fascist 'fighting' group to show the world they exist. What's so important in today's world anyway to seek the pride of being part of something, of belonging, networking, socializing? Why the need to collect friends and masturbating over an artificial popularity when all you can have are ephemeral but sincere moments of fun with authentic human beings.Barfly doesn't take itself seriously but doesn't lie either, the ways of truth are impenetrable and often choose the least likely avenues. And Barfly works like a reverse fantasy attracting us to the bottom, finding the inner beauty of life in the freedom of action, of spirit and more than anything, belonging to nothing but a true community of ephemeral friends for ephemeral pleasures. No class, no social category, no people, no bourgeois, being an outcast, and even a disgrace, is a luxury providing the most honest vision on the world, not diluted by personal or political bias. You can't be an artist if you're not an outcast and on that level, Chinasky is more than an artist, he's a genuine genius &#x85; So, if only for Rourke's spectacular performance, for the witty script, for the so enjoyably cheerful mood and its gallery of colorful and likable characters, not to mention the beautiful shots on Dunaway's sexy legs &#x85; this movie deserves to be consumed without moderation.

The plot? Mickey Rourke plays Henry Chinaski, an alcoholic who bounces from one menial job to the next. Though intelligent and highly attuned to his surroundings, and though he's adept at writing poetry and prose, Henry spends most of his time sucking booze and hanging out with night owls and barflies.The film's second half watches as Henry strikes up a relationship with Wanda (Faye Dunnaway), a fellow drunk, and Tully, a high flying publisher. Along the way he feuds with Eddie, who represents everything Henry deplores superficiality, shallowness, self-promotion, work, success, money etc. Henry's last act choice is thus familiar. He's asked to choose between either intoxicated anonymity or a writing career (which he perceives to be selling out). You're trapped in a cage with golden bars, Henry tells others, but how much is his own cage a product of his own personal fears and more self-destructive traits?Charles Bukowski's prose has a certain rhythm to it; it flies off the page. Indeed, Jean-Paul Sartre would declare Bukowski the most important American writer of the 21st century. But whilst Schroeder's film contains a number of great lines and some good dialogue, he can't quite capture the distinct tempo of Bukowski. Unsurprisingly, Bukowski himself was hugely critical of the film.7.9/10 &#x96; Worth one viewing.

According to Bukowski he slammed down the phone the second he heard Will you write a screenplay? Schroeder calls again moments latter only to get the same result however, this time Bukowski throws in a F*** You! for good measure. On the third call Schroeder manages to say a little bit more, Will you write a screenplay for $22,000.00? This time Bukowski stays on the line.In a film that has countless problems I think this is the most outstanding. The script fails to capture the same unrefined vigor and beat of Bukowski's writing. The stylized verse is there but the foundation is not. Watching the film I wondered if Bukowski really wrote it, the film feels more like someone attempting to write a Bukowskiesque character study.Barbet Schroeder claims that Bukowski is his favorite author but his film seems to entirely miss that nail in favor of the clichéd and asinine. The true potential of this disjointed narrative can only be glimpsed at in short-lived scenes The bookend opening and closing sequence, Wanda placing a crucifix under her pillow, and Chinaski cleaning his wounds with Scotch. These sequences play out wonderfully but scenes with similar potential are squandered by Schroeder's unambiguous attempts to make certain the audience gets it. The scene with the Pegasus is destroyed in this fashion.Faye Dunaway and Mickey Rourke turn in inconsistent mediocre performances. Rourke's interpretation of Bukowski is below par and superficial and Dunaway (Wanda) comes off like a stock character.The Biggest disappointment for me was Robby Müller. Films like Breaking the Waves (1996), Dead Man (1995), Mystery Train (1989), and Paris, Texas (1984) are just a small sample of Müller's cinematography. Barfly is a visual failure compared to the level of work Müller is capable of delivering.I don't know if the shortcomings of this film can be credited to Bukowski's selling-out or if the blame should be placed on Schroeder.

So here, I give you the little seen gem from 1987, Barfly.Mickey Rourke in the title role, takes method acting to a whole new level. I'm not sure what happened between takes, but I feel that he might have stayed in character, didn't shower, probably wore the same clothes, and went by the name of his lead, Henry Chinaski. He drinks like a fish, inhabits the slumming L.A. bars, and gets into fights with a bartender named Eddie (played effectively by Sly Stallone's brother, Frank Stallone). When he's not fighting, failing to pay his rent, and aspiring to be a writer, he gets the attention of a beautiful older woman (another drunk played by Faye Dunaway as Wanda Wilcox). They form an interesting relationship that anchors a large majority of what's on screen. As they wallow in their drunkenness, Henry is pursued by a detective and a women news writer who wants to publish one of his stories.Almost feeling like a film told in a dreamlike state, Barfly is a character study that revels in irony and self-loathing. It's dirty, free forming, and harbors grubby, all too realistic performances. The side characters are people who you'd find in an alley and kinda look like homeless vagabonds. This is truly Los Angeles at its most depressing and most hideous. The script is based on the writings and life of the famed novelist Charles Bukowski. And the short running time sort of ends and begins in the same exact way. There are some quotable lines, an honest, demented take on the concept of dying, and a cameo by the screenwriter and novelist himself.Ultimately, it's Rourke's shining moment and Barfly succeeds because of him and almost nothing else. During the first half of the proceedings, his inebriated Henry utters the line, don't worry, no one's loved me yet. Well this critic loved Mickey's realistic, balls out performance. Forget his Oscar nominated turn in The Wrestler. This is bar none, his best work.

Charles Bukowski isn't my favourite writer by far, but perhaps he found his medium in film. Barfly is an excellent blend of working class ennui and love, and down-and-out philosophy. Henry Chinaski, Bukowski's alter-ego, is a lovable bastard, although the other characters in the film are ill-defined. But then, they're barely real to Chinaski, so I guess it works. The pace and anti-climactic ending may not be for everyone, just as Bukowski's alcoholic existentialism is an acquired taste, and a few of the actors (in bit parts) seem to struggle portraying their rough, lower class characters. But overall, it's a great film, definitely recommended for people who enjoy low-key, slightly skewed, films about interesting people.

I didn't even know who Charles Bukowski was at the time, I just thought the trailers looked good and I guess, was a fan of Mickey Rourke, whom I had just seen in 'ANGEL HEART' . This is one of those movies you get absorbed into, that when it ends, you don't want it to - you want to stay IN the moment, as if you're a part of the characters and your life is ending! Very few movies do this to me, but this is one of the first that did. The highlight of the film I think, is when Charlie wins an alley brawl and gets a few bucks from the bets (says to Jim, his confidant, What do you think I am, a bum?) and walks into a sleazy old bar down the street called the Kenmore. There, he first sees Faye Dunaway, looking pretty good, yet no man is sitting by her, hitting on her, etc. WHY? he wonders...so, he asks the bartender Who's that? 'That's Wanda.' Well, why's she all alone? She looks some some sort of distressed goddess! - She's crazy. With that, 'Henry' goes over and introduces himself to Wanda and they go home together after 2 scotch & sodas! CLASSIC! You can't beat that with a stick! They then co-habitate and go through their various trials & fights, but one has the feeling it works out for them both in the end....but we never get to see it, coz the movie ends before we can see it happen! That's the only down-side to it. It's a short movie, under 90 minutes, and some would say it's depressing to watch....but I loved the hell out of it and would venture to say it is possibly Rourke's & Dunaway's best work. And they certainly won't look that good again anytime soon. Those days are over! Old-age sucks. But they were in their prime at that moment in time, 1987. Go get Barfly! Or become one.

Having spent a fair amount of time on bar stools at seedy joints (when I thought they had atmosphere) it is very difficult to see Rourke blowing his money on all his friends. Friends? Yeah, right. Both movies also prove that no matter how much of a lowlife one is, there is always somebody willing to go down with you. I'm only glad I saw the light and gave all of that up.

So yes, Hank wrote the story, and Schroeder shot the movie. It results in a beautiful movie, absolutely not dark or mean, but just kind of joyful. The characters played by Rourke and Dunaway just give the impression they pass through life without noticing it, their ambitions being all but to get some more drinks at the next corner's bar, even if they can't pay it. Rourke and Dunaway performances are incredible, in fact, and it's also so funny to watch at Stallone's brother as a macho bar-tender...

Along with Angel Heart, this is possibly Rourke's finest performance. As Henry Chinaski, he stumbles from drinking den to bar fight and back again, occasionally scribbling notes and poems decrying the state of humanity to the music of Mahler. Seemingly impervious to the influence of others he meets Dunaway's Wanda Wilcox, herself an almost mirror image of Chinaski's desperation and dirty purity. Filled with many memorable scenes, liberating the contents of a neighbours fridge, running from the police after stealing corncobs, eating the fat man's sandwich, falling about the plush apartment of literary agent Alice Kreig, their attempts to find any gainful employment... even the peripheral characters are a joy.

Faye Dunaway plays a perfect 'stress goddess' and co-drinker with Henry, the alcoholic poet. The gritty street scenes and back alley brawls superimposed on the gilded 'cage' of poetic and literary stardom that could be Henry's make for a great story that is somewhat biographical of the cult writer Charles Bukowski, whose life is used as a template.I recommend this as a modern day tale of our century's Poe, with drinking, debauchery, and just great quotes abundant within.DLC "},{"Title":"Ah, its a togh life...","Date":"22 September 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  I'm a great fan of Bukowski.

Rourke plays Bukowski really well - just about as I thought about him...Faye plays well too. But I don't believe that Bukowski had that kind of women on his mind. Also, Bukowski reached stardom in his 50's not late 30's (as Rourke looks). Another great thing in this movie is that Alcoholism is not showed as a good thing. Drinking was not main theme.

It may sound depressing, but it really isn't. Chinasky goes around doing unexpected things, keeping himself moderately drunk constantly.I like the film and it gives me the same kind of smile as Bukowskis books give me. The only annoying thing is that Rourke isn't much of a Chinaski. Chinsaksi is supposed to be 40-50 years old and I don't think Rourke portrays him very well. But in overall it's still a good film that I strongly recommend. See it!Bukowski later wrote a book about the making of this film. Its a good introduction to Bukowskis writing, and paints a not always positive image of Hollywood. The Rourke character in the book is described as a spoiled kid, with an ego larger than an football stadium. Read it, the title is Hollywood. Visit your local library today!

The guru of the Actors Studio would scream at his fledgling actors, Stop acting, when they got carried away. Would that Barbett Schroeder the director, gave the same advice to Rourke, Dunaway et al. Rourke does a funny walk as Cinaski/Bukowski, and a funny way of talking that almost reduces his role to slapstick.          This scenario that takes place mainly in a low class bar, is supposed to be Bukowski's life, when everybody knows HE WORKED IN THE US POST OFFICE FOR MANY YEARS, untill he started to make money writing. Yes he was a boozer and a brawler in dives like this, but he was also a 9 to 5 prole like you and me.           One has to wonder what Brando would do with this part. Lots of us thought Rourke was on his way in the Brando tradition, His carrer seems to be on hold.

It has many familiar scenes and ideas presented in his catalog of short stories and novels, which were always partly autobiographical.

No halfhearted vows to quit and get himself together.  No trips to AA only tofall off the wagon.  And best of all, no self pity.  Rourke's characteramiably goes about his sordid existence and even eschews any attempts tobring him out of the muck.  He does not even seem upset when he is flatbroke and hence unable to procure more booze.  He is cheerfully assuredthat something always comes up.Other reasons to like this movie Rourke - although I kept wishing hewould take just one shower, but I suppose that's the point, isn't it -and his unusual, almost beatnik line delivery, Dunaway, who plays Wanda,somebody who was obviously beautiful at one point but has drunk all thatbeauty away, the fact that it translates well into the next decadedespite the fact that it was made in the dread eighties.POSSIBLE SPOILERI also like that the movie does not take itself too seriously.

At this moment, while I was watching, I knew that somebody involved in the production really, REALLY knew what it was like to be a certified Drunk.  At last!It's not the attractive drunk, as we have had before in an infinite number of films before this (The Lost Weekend, gripping work that it was, didn't make Ray Milland look all that bad).  Mickey Rourke plays a character whom, if you saw him order a Big Mac, you'd head over to Burger King.  If you saw him sign up for the Peace Corps, you'd enlist in the Marine Corps.  If you...you get the idea.  He's very nearly the filthiest film character I've ever come across, and I've seen some trophy-winners.  This movie is not an ad for alcoholic beverages by any stretch of the imagination.And yet Barfly is funny, compelling, and extremely watchable--almost compulsively so.  Rourke's character is a poet, and (key plot element about to be revealed) a damn good one.  He's so good that--you know how songs byfictional musicians in the movies are usually crap?--not the case here. He's so good that Alice Krige (later featured as the Borg queen...nevermind) BREAKS into his apartment to verify that the writing her publication has received is indeed from the same zoo creature she discovers (no--uncovers) in the local bar down the block.But Rourke (too lazy to find his character name) has his own little planets in orbit, even if they're crashing together.  He's got something to prove to the overgrown barkeep (none other than FRANK Stallone), and plenty of no-brainer adventures with his current hitch, played by the luminous Faye Dunaway.It's this kind of story that I like the best  wayward genius must choose between living by his emotions and whims, or taking responsibility and getting on with his life.  I liked it when they made it as A Thousand Clowns, and later on with Good Will Hunting.  I like it because, except for the genius part, that sort of story pretty much sums up my own life.

Henry (Mickey Rourke in an incredible performance) hangs out in a run down bar where no one likes him and he constantly picks fights (and loses) with the night bartender, played by Frank Stallone. After finally winning one of the brawls, Henry hooks up with Wanda (Faye Dunaway), another Barfly who has her own reasons for consuming too much alcohol.  They develop a special bond, much like the relationship between Nicholas Cage and Elisabeth Shue in LEAVING LAS VEGAS.  Two individuals who genuinely care for each other and accept each other for what they are.Meanwhile, a rich literary agent is pursuing both Henry and his work. Through her he can change his life around if he so chooses.  What the agent does not understand is the way he lives his life is the reason he can write such powerful words. Rourke's portrayal of a loser/genius who sees the world differently than most is a knockout.  Highly recommended. "},{"Title":"Crazy, drunk, aimless and..................

Faye Dunaway gave a exceptional performance, but of course, Mickey Rourke stole the show.  Everything from his walk to his loooong drawn out vocabulary struck me as brilliant.  Though the film seemed to drag on at parts, I felt myself dragging right along with it.  It made me question, Who is really 'crazy'??  Though Mickey's character, Henry, is labeled as crazy, others look at him as a poetic genius. Probably my favorite part of this film is the tough guy attitude of Sylvester Stallone's brother, Frank.

He disdains one of the bartenders named Eddie (Frank Stallone) which results in frequent fistfights which Henry typically loses. One night, however, he manages to beat up Eddie and because of it he is ejected from the bar. Needing a new place to satisfy his alcoholism he wanders into another nightclub where he meets Wanda Wilcox (Faye Dunaway) who is just as alcoholic as he is. Naturally, they hit it off right away. When she tells him she dislikes people in general, he responds by saying that he doesn't dislike them so much as he simply feels better when they're not around. Anyway, rather than spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it, I will just say this isn't just a film about barroom brawls and drinking. Instead there are some philosophical points made in the midst of the squalor that even Tully Sorenson (Alice Krige) may not quite understand. At any rate, while I'm not a huge fan of either Mickey Rourke or Faye Dunaway, I have to admit that they both put on a good performance in this film. Above average.

His books are always rapidly paced but the films based on his work are usually slower. Barfly is no exception. This is definitely not a good starting point for discovering the man. The film plays him as sort of a charming yet idiot drunkard. You don't get any of the feel for his writing through the film. For all of its flaws, Factotum had the brilliant device of having the Bukowski alter ego Chinaski narrate the story, giving the audience an idea of just how great Bukowski was with words. Barfly needs a narration very badly. Fortunately, the screenplay was by Bukowski so all the lines are golden and tragically human, which fans have come to expect from him.That being said, the film is certainly entertaining even though I can see why Bukowski was incredibly disappointed upon viewing it. Mickey Rourke is over-the-top and doesn't really capture the mannerisms of Bukowski, but is always amusing and does a good job at making the character likable if a bit dumbed down. Much better is Faye Dunaway as his lover. She turns in a painfully realistic performance and doesn't go for laughs like Rourke often seems to. The film is a bit too comedic, but it is very funny in spots.In all, people with no interest in the author will certainly be entertained. Novices need to look elsewhere, and die-hard fans' opinions will be divided. Personally, I enjoyed the film even if it wasn't a true representation of Bukowski. Both Crazy Love and Factotum are better, but Barfly is an admirable try. Even better are the interviews Barbet Schroeder conducted with Bukowski to prepare for the film. Entitled The Charles Bukowski Tapes, they're a collection of brief interviews running a total of four hours. Trust me, Bukowski is one of the few human beings worth listening to for that duration of time. Long a bootleg favorite, they have recently been released to DVD by Barrel Entertainment.

Bukowski questioned conventional attitudes towards success, materialism, love and prosperity and, incredibly, managed to live the destructive life he wrote about and achieved a reasonable measure of literary success, especially in France.Barbet Schroeder's film is based on Bukowski's own script and captures a short period in the writer's unconventional life. Mickey Rourke's performance as Henry Chinaski (Bukowski) is very convincing; Rourke makes Henry accessible without resorting to cliché and typical drunk actor histrionics. Faye Dunaway, as Henry's love interest, Wanda Wilcox, delivers a moving, nuanced performance that equals Rourke's for its intensity.Schroeder fills Henry's world with colorful, damaged and brain dead characters, each representing a recognizable social, cultural or racial type. Henry's brief, failed liaison with publisher Tully Sorenson (Alice Krige) says everything Bukowski wanted to say about class division.The film is surprisingly optimistic and never less than a fascinating look at a curious sub-culture.Bukowski himself cameos as a barfly in one scene.

Give Roarke credit for choosing to appear in such an unflattering role, but this is no ordinary bum. He's a philosopher drunkard who listens to Mozart and Mahler when he isn't picking a fight or puking in an alley after one drink too many, a man whose total freedom from responsibility gives him the power to be completely spontaneous.

There is a scene in the movie where Charles Bukowski himself sits in the bar drinking his beer and smoking his cigarette staring at his silhouette..

Any class.","Date":"1 September 2002","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  I'd like to comment on this film, and dispel a few things as noted by the previous reviewer. For one, I'm not sure this movie should have been viewed by the general audience. This film was a love letter of sorts from every REAL Bukowski fan to show the world that even Hollywood can stand up and make one righteous film, and NOT for Tom and Janie at the multiplex, who have the mental capacity of lab rats, as their idea of 'art' and 'culture' is when Britney takes off her kit again. Hank Bukowski (as his fans knew him) was one of the greatest American poets EVER, who escaped death's grip more than a few times, fought everything through actually living his life, struggled with demons and drank gloriously, doing it all with a style that the ooh-la-la middle class would give their BMWs and little white picket fences to enjoy, if for only a moment. This film is a semi-biography of sorts, based on his play of the same title. You should really read this first to understand all of the characters, from aging whore Grandma Moses, who can 'suck the paste right out of you like a Hoover vaccuum', to the sad on his way down himself bartender called Eddie, who finds a thrill in proving he can beat up a bum - and Henry is the center of his hurricane. The one really depressing part is when Tully, a rich woman also looking for her sad middle class version of a Van Gogh type in the bars and kitchenette apartments, reaches down from her ivory tower and pursues Henry to the point of nauseation. It figures that the middle class, ANY class, always has to look to the misfits they tortured in high school for art, any art, to justify their dull dull dull existence. These are the same people, Mr. and Mrs. Jones, if they saw their former outcasts on the street, would get back into the safety of their SUV's and go back to the Gap. However, it cannot be denied that in the world (and in this film, recreated very well in the skid row section of L.A. - don't look for it now, it's all strip malls, boutiques and Starbucks) there will always be the ones who didn't make it, and have to end up somewhere. This is the world, and the film, of Charles Hank Bukowski, who could out-write all of those poser 'beat' poets of the 50s. If you really compare them, they had about as much originality as a Tom and Janey. Sadly, in the colleges of our world, our kids are forced to believe guys like this were just a footnote to this 'beat poet generation'. It's a TRAVESTY. About the actors this was NOT Mickey Rourke's 'finest hour' (as his chameleon-like acting can grate at times), but I have to admit he was pretty darn close with the slow drawl, the introspective ways, and the power in which a BUM (and he loved to be called this, not the politically correc t HOMELESS invented by the liberal bleeding hearts) could command a bar, a room, a woman, anything he tried to touch in his life. This man lived a life 50 yuppies could never understand. Faye Dunaway is interesting as Wanda, one of the many women in his life. Who hasn't met a woman like this in a bar, desperate, wanting, but always going about the wrong way in which to get it? Women have it worse than men in life, here he shows us that for a bottle of booze, you could least have a woman's attention for a little while. A last footnote The title of this film BARFLY does not refer to any one person specifically, but the entire subculture of lowlifes, bums, whores, and those so down they can relate to this life, drinking to escape, to feel and laugh one more time, to hope and dream, and to get just one more round down before closing time. The suit and ties only WISH they could feel this alive, even when sucking down their $5 beers and trying to act like they're living, even though a few of know it's all a giant beer commercial. Bukowski wrote this to show that people like this do exist, and can survive, somehow. Give this film a chance and show your kids, if you dare to. They might just surprise you in that maybe they will connect with this film, and are just as disaffected as Henry was, but the video games and cell phones and credit cards you've bought them have rotted out their minds so badly they don't know how to vocalize their frustrations. Kinda like lab rats. This film has STYLE, and if you want any other suggestions on films about the REAL struggle in life, go check out Tales of Ordinary Madness, or even Paris, Texas.

Most of the movie is dull and stilted and some parts are embarrassing to watch. Faye Dunaway plays Henry's lover, but even she cannot bring any magic to the screen. The problem with 'Barfly' is that it does not allow any kind of spontaneity or improvisation from the actors.I could tell while watching it that the characters were reading lines from the screenplay and not coming up with anything original on their own. When people are getting drunk at the bar, they can say some pretty ridiculous, funny, or even profound things. This movie had none of that. The filmmaker should have gotten the actors drunk and then filmed what happened. The might have been more interesting than what the screenplay had to offer. 'Barfly' had some interesting ideas to explore, but it failed miserably at every single one of them. Also, the movie has a happy ending.

I know this because I once had a friend ( Hope you read this Ange and apologies in advance ) who was a massive fan and if it wasn't for her I'd never heard of the guy who is totally unknown in Britain and if it wasn't for this film adaptation of his semi autobiographical novel BARFLY he'd be even more obscure , but even then this film is half forgotten and I was totally convinced that it was a star vehicle for Jack Nicholson and Meryll Streep until I saw it again today and I'm not surprised it's somewhat forgotten . Some people have criticised it's lost something from page to screen . Well I think that's happens to drunks . We've all heard of the vodka diet -  I lost four days in a week  One can perhaps see the appeal of the black comedy elements as Henry Chinaski and Wanda Wilcox as they drink themselves in to nightly oblivion . There is of course strong autobiographical elements to the story with Chinaski being Charles Bukowski in everything but name and the character arc of Chinaski mirroring that of Bukowski . Chinaski is an urban anti-hero but if there's a problem with anti-heroes they've a peculiar idiosyncratic character quirks that makes them unlikable to a degree . The degree of unlikability to Chinaski is a bit too extreme . He's not a courageous quixotic existentialist figure fighting against a world of indifference but one who is happy to live life through alcoholic soma . As someone who grew up in a drinking culture in the West of Scotland surrounded by drunks I can state without fear of contradiction that drunks are almost universally worthless degenerates amongst the lowest examples of humanity . Disagree ? If someone's ambition extends no further then their next drink then how is that different from an insect whose whole DNA instructs it to have no more ambition to nibble the nearest leaf ? No difference at all from an intellectual point of view . Let's not also forget that in Victorian Britain all drugs were legal and yet literature chronicles that the worst drug of the masses was alcohol . More addictive than heroin , more mind bending than magic mushrooms alcohol along with religion are the worst thing the human species has invented "},{"Title":"Mickey becomes Bukowski","Date":"9 January 2007","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" I saw Barfly when it was first out not knowing anything about Charles Bukowski. After reading Bukowski and watching him recite some of his work on You-Tube, I gained a renewed appreciation for Mickey's portrayal of Bukowski. He talks like him, acts like him and demonstrates the values of Bukowski. Maybe his best role ever. A truly artful movie - you can almost smell the bar smell - and Bukowski. You can feel the view Bukowski has for the world around him. I'm glad he was able to achieve some of the notoriety in his life before he passed in 1994. This movie is a glimpse into the lifestyle of bar-life and of a man who lived in, knew well and wrote about the underbelly of that life. I can't think of anyone else who could have done a better job than Mickey. Mat Dillon tried in Factotem but he's too pretty to be Bukowski.

I was just sitting with my sister and her boyfriend, and I brought up Bonnie and Clyde and how I liked Faye Dunaway, without hesitation her boyfriend started laughing and said to watch this movie he pronounced BARFly, which I still don't get how that's funny. But he said to take a look at it.Barfly is about a violent alcoholic poet who meets another female alcoholic, they have a strange love connection and start some kind of romance, if that's the proper way to say it. But they feed off of each other and their addiction, but as usual, it turns out that they need each other more than they realize.Over all, it's not a bad movie, just I wasn't too into it. It was slow paced and had o.k. performances. But don't shy away from it, this is just one person's opinion. But Faye Dunaway, I wasn't sure if my sister's boyfriend was trying to change my opinion, but she's the only decent actor in the film.5/10 "}{"Title":"eh","Date":"14 February 2002","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  I think that after seeing this movie I'll have to put Bukowski atop my list of great writers that are just incontrovertable to movies. The simple fact is that Bukowski doesn't write intricate, entertaining plots. Really he just writes a series of monoscenes. They're repulsive and realistic and most importantly employ fantastic language. The things that back it fun to read Bukowski just don't show up in a movie. It was interesting to see as a curiosity for a fan though. I also hoped there'd be a lot more insight into his writing and inspirations. Despite what he writes about, he does spend a huge amount of time reading and writing. You know those nice quotes at the end of certain scenes? That's what Bukowski writing is.

It's almost impossible to convey how let down I am, now that I've seen it. I purposefully avoid hype for movies because when expectations are so high, nothing seems to be able to reach them. I usually avoid the hype train whenever possible. That said, I was jacked to see this movie and was fully aboard the hype train. It couldn't be helped. So, I was certainly open to intense disappointment had this movie not been good. I'm so unhappy to report this has happened.The only word I can think of to describe this movie is dull. It's unexceptional work and everything that I had hoped it wouldn't be. It's not entertainment, to be sure. It has none of the nuances a drinker wants to see. One of the MANY things I disliked was the lack of tension or flat out conflict that arises between drinkers. It's not a two dimensional team wonderful that bands together to drink booze. Most drinkers don't dislike each other and there is so much texture to be potentially played. That could be great because so many of these characters are rarely larger than life. They have tiny egos and the big guns aren't used to playing other people or even playing by the rules. In this film they are all thrown together in an unbelievable fashion. Again, much less than I ever dreamed possible.The entire cast didn't really deliver. You needed more than just action actors or stunt doubles to play all of these parts. The pathos isn't there, and nor is the timing and truly deep performances. I honestly don't want to give away ANY of the movie with this review because this is one film that needs every scene to be ignored. Do yourself a favor and remain unspoiled. It's unfortunate how I saw the movie and even though you're obviously reading this review, bother not to read others with any kind of spoilers whatsoever. Experience the awesomeness of not seeing it for yourself. "}]
