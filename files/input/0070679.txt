[{"Title":"Whitey's perspective","Date":"19 June 2000","Score":"19 out of 24 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Crime","Review":"  As an urban white kid in the 1970s, I just sort of ignored the Shaft movies. Too ethnic, too threatening &#150; the usual crap.  Afterwards, they were just sort of forgotten.  But the fictional character John Shaft, who was once a scary black icon for many white Americans, now seems to enjoy almost universal affection as an indelible part of American pop culture.After all these years, I finally got around to watching all three Shaft movies for the first time, all in one weekend, from the new and excellent DVD editions.  On buying these DVDs I noticed the video store clerk smiling at them, which prompted me to suggest that John Shaft is a bad mother&#133;  He immediately answered with the expected response `Shut yo mouth.'  We had a laugh over that, and it occurred to me that you could probably say that line on the Great Wall of China and still get the expected response.These transfers look fresher and sharper than they probably ever looked on the big screen, even in the 1970s.  A real treat!  No extras aside from the trailers for all three films, which are certainly fun to watch, but the films themselves are so much fun, why complain?  A lot has been said about the significance of the Shaft films, and their effect on the black and white communities and their perceptions of each other.  I don't feel particularly qualified to address all that, but I will say that these are damn good thrillers by any standard.  `Shaft' and `Shaft's Big Score' are gritty urban thrillers showcasing New York City circa 1970s, untamed and unapologetic. They involved dueling gangsters both black and white, hardass NYPD detectives, and of course super-cool, super-bad brother man Shaft caught in the middle, looking out for himself and his buddies.  Watch them both back-to-back as I did, and you'll find yourself involuntarily speaking in 1970's slang by the time you're through.  Yeah, it's a little cheesy, but so what?  It's great fun too.  `Shaft in Africa' is a radical departure, wherein Shaft becomes involved in cracking an international slave trading operation.  This takes him from New York, to Africa, to Paris for a final confrontation with a James Bondian foreign villain played nicely by British actor Frank Finlay.  The colorful locales (Ethiopia, Paris) and badass action make it a great finish to the Shaft trilogy, and needless to say, Richard Rountree brings it off to perfection.  Anyone who enjoys the older James Bond films should enjoy Shaft in Africa, as they have a lot in common stylistically.One more point  these films were made in the early 70's, which means that when Shaft `gets it on' with a lady, as he inevitably does, we do not see ten minutes of graphic sex.  The camera moves away tactfully and we move on to the next scene, much in the style of the old James Bond films of that era, but with a bit more skin visible.  The sex scenes are tame by today's standards, but the films were R-rated in their time, and the old trailers for them warn the moviegoer that if you are underage and want to see the film, `you gotta ask yo mamma.'

'Shaft In Africa' sees director Gordon Parks and creator/writer Ernest Tidyman replaced by John Guillermin and Stirling Silliphant, a safer more Hollywood team which would hit pay dirt the following year with 'The Towering Inferno'. It doesn't have much of a blaxploitation feel to it, it's more of a James Bond thing with a black Bond, but that's okay, it's entertaining enough, and a definite improvement on the lacklustre 'Shaft's Big Score!' Richard Roundtree once again plays super cool private dick John Shaft. This time he is coerced into going undercover in Africa to try and break a slavery ring run by the evil Amafi (Frank Finlay). Roundtree is one cool mutha, and this movie features more sex and violence than the others, so it's easy to watch. Vonetta McGee ('Hammer', 'Blacula') plays Shaft's main love interest, but he also finds time to bed Amafi's sexy and amoral mistress Jazar (Neda Arneric) along the way. It's a pity that there weren't more Shaft movies after this as you could see the series having a lot of life left in it. Instead Richard Roundtree made a TV series which lasted a couple of years, and then his career started to slide into obscurity. By the 1980s he was mostly playing supporting cop roles in dumb action movies. Why this happened is anybody's guess as Roundtree was, along with Fred Williamson, the coolest and most charismatic of the 1970s blaxploitation stars. Both actors deserved a lot more mainstream success.

It all starts with the title, Shaft in Africa. The concept of Shaft going to Africa and the cover alone are reason enough to get it. Plus, it is inexpensive and can be found at most retail stores. Ok, lets break this film down shall we. First, while watching this movie I laughed harder than I ever have before. The second time the man with the staff broke down Shaft's door, I was in tears. The first time was hilarious, but again? Pure, unadulterated genius. Shaft is like James Bond minus all of the silly innuendo and sex jokes. Plus, you actually get to see NUDITY, albeit some is Richard Roundtree's bare rear end and a fat hooker, there is an extremly hot vixen NAKED. You can never tell what is going to happen next whether he be riding a camel or the whole, triangle shirt-waist factory inspired, building fire minus the locked doors and the slaves actually running UPSTAIRS. To sum it up, this movie has it all. Sex, Violence, Gore, Explosions, Stick fights, door breaking, but sadly, features a dog getting killed which NO ONE wants to see. I seriously think the only reason the dog was there was so that Shaft could utter the Only one man died today, and two dogs line, which wasn't that amusing. No one wants to see a dog getting killed. This movie rocks my socks off. Period.

Some of the more explicit content includes a rather frank conversation about female circumcision, the senseless death of an innocent pooch, and villain Amafi's nymphomaniac girlfriend Jazar (Neda Arneric) becoming sexually aroused while watching black workmen digging up a road (she also questions Shaft about the size of his phallus, who eventually satisfies her curiosity by shagging her).Directed with zest by John Guillerman, a film-maker well versed in African adventures (he previously helmed two Tarzan movies and war movie Guns at Batasi, and would go on to make Sheena Queen of the Jungle), Shaft in Africa is a fun film that moves along at a more than reasonable pace with plenty of action. It is, however, a far cry from the seedy world of pimps, pushers and prostitutes that one usually associates with the blaxploitation genre. As such, it failed to satisfy existing fans of the character, was a failure at the box office, and signalled the end of the franchise.

That's his turf, and putting him in a robe with a stick is just too much.This film just went too far, past where the imagination can stretch, in letting Shaft win.

John Guillermen takes over from blaxplotation maestro Gordon Parks as director and excellently brings freshness to the whole thing, with Richard Roundtree's supercool private eye being sent to Ethopia in order to infiltrate and bring down a ruthless slave-trading scam. This entry is wonderfully self-concious in the fact that it all smacks of the Bond saga - even Shaft says it when he finds himself handed a couple of gadgets for his mission.  Therefore, there's a strong and largely satisfying formula behind the whole affair.  The action is still a little clumsy and quite excessively violent, but in general this is bigger, brighter and funner than what came before it.

This requires him to travel to where the slave business begins&#x97;Africa. Now, as far as the movie is concerned, while Shaft may be in Africa he is totally out of his natural environment--and this film suffers as a result. To further elaborate, Shaft's greatest strength was his ability to negotiate the urban landscape of New York City using his considerable experience and attitude to their fullest advantage. Unfortunately, both of these skills are negated once he is taken out of his element for which he&#x97;and the movie itself&#x97;has to compensate for by relying almost solely on his physical prowess and blind luck. At least, that is how some of these scenes seemed to play out to me. In any case, in my opinion this movie fails to compare favorably to its famous predecessor Shaft or to a lesser degree with that of Shaft's Big Score!. Even so, I liked the performance of Richard Roundtree and having Vonetta McGee (as Aleme) certainly didn't hurt either. In summation, this wasn't a terrible movie&#x97;but it wasn't nearly as good as it should have been and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly below average.

The issue of female circumcision is mentioned by a black African woman who is westernized but wants to embrace the ways of her ancestors and enter into a 'relationship of honor where there would be no sex involved.' I find that a really unnecessary nod to ways that are best forgotten as they are essentially disgusting practices-that have been forced on young women in Africa who suffered because of it in the modern era. Shaft casually used the F bomb to talk about the sex act which is very tacky. Only sh*** use that kind of language in todays world-sh*** and hookers with really low IQ's. Towards the end of the film a guy with a submachine gun misses Shaft who is standing in the open not 30 feet away from him. Can you say there's no way that would happen in real life-yes-I knew you could. Plus some white guy has dark makeup all over his face to play the part of some white guy who has lived in Addis Ababa a long time-yet he also appears later in the film as a bad guy sans dark makeup. Kinda wonky. The issue that the film talk about via its plot is modern slavery-kudos for talking about some serious sh** no kudos for doing it such a f***** up way that it really does't mean a whole lot. It was made ages ago. So who cares. Maybe its still worth 'discussing' somewhere-like here. I think people liked it because it was Shaft but I also think it not a very good film.

In Shaft in Africa, New York City's coolest private eye infiltrates a modern-day slave trader's operation from its source in rural Africa and follows it to metropolitan Paris, France. This blaxploitation actioneer lacks the jive of previous Shaft thrillers primarily because Ernst Tidyman who created the character and penned the first two was no longer on board the franchise. Our seminal African-American gumshoe has really scaled the ladder of affluence by this time. Now, he resides in a sumptuously appointed apartment and drives a BMW. Indeed, Shaft is no longer either freezing his fanny off in Harlem or tangling with trigger-happy Italian mobsters or profane black gangsters. Out of the blue, strangers assail Shaft, take him hostage and force him to cope under some of the worst conditions imaginable as part of a gauntlet to test his mettle. Eventually, Shaft learns that he has been chose to perform a task what nobody else has been able to accomplish go undercover to expose modern-day slavers. Tarzan Goes to India helmer John Guillermin takes over the directing from Gordon Parks, and MGM sends Shaft out of the Big Apple. Talk about a change of place and pace! Shaft has to rely on his prowess with a walking stick because he isn't allow to carry a gun. In this instance, he lives up to Teddy Roosevelt's dictum he walks quietly and carries a big stick. This is no simple but one that has a microfilm camera hidden in the staff. Guillerman and In the Heat of the Night scenarist Stirling Silliphant thrust Shaft into some of the most unusual predicaments, whether he is thrashing a man nearly to death for killing his dog or getting the drop on a pistol-wielding assassin with a silencer and snapping his neck, Shaft is every inch the alpha male here as he was in the earlier Shaft epics. The exotic scenery, the culture, and Shaft's tenacity with surprises occurring every twenty minutes make this opus a high point in a series that went into a nose-dive afterward and never recovered. Roundtree is good as the eponymous private eye, and Frank Finlay makes a dastardly villain. Spaghetti western bad guy Aldo Sambrell plays Angelo, one of Finlay's gunsels who kills without a qualm. Shaft has an interesting sexual encounter with a nymphomaniac Jazar (Neda Arneric of Breakdown) who rigs up a tape-recording of their coitus so kinky her boyfriend can listen to it. Guillerman never lets the action slow down for a breather and something exciting is happening throughout its 106 minutes.

The plot left something to be desired as it came across with some lulls. There is plenty of sex and violence and if that's your bag, then Shaft in Africa is your movie. The bad guys know he's coming as Shaft snuffs out numerous attempts of his life as he carries out his mission. Richard Roundtree does a good job of portraying the indomitable John Shaft. Frank Finlay plays the main villain (Vincent Amafi), who heads the slavery racket. The women of John Shaft are the educated and beautiful Aleme, (Vonetta McGee) plus the alluring and one track minded Jazar, (Yugoslavian actress Neda Arneric). McGee plays the daughter of the Emir, who hires Shaft, and is Shaft's main love interest. Arneric is Amafi's mistress, who offers her assistance to corner Shaft by diverting his attention. Arneric steams up the big screen with her provocative seduction scene as she entices Shaft aboard the slave smuggling ship. Shaft senses this is a trap as he makes sure the coast is clear and interrogates Jazar, before he finally relents to her persistence and they make love in her cabin. The movie does have a strong ending as Shaft makes his way to Paris and saves the day,as he shuts down the slavery racket. There were other books written by Ernest Tidyman however this served to be the last Shaft movie made during the 70's.

It only approaches the true gravity needed to convey the nature of these crimes a couple of times in the film. Most of the time Shaft is being the wise ass jawbreaker we all know and love. That's OK...this isn't PBS. Frank Findlay is under-appreciated on these shores, sort of the way Charles Dance is currently. Vonetta McGee was as hot as any starlet back in the day.

Unfortunately, the sequels (SHAFT'S BIG SCORE and SHAFT IN Africa) were major disappointments--mostly due to really bad writing and lots of ridiculous story elements. In SHAFT'S BIG SCORE, Shaft has a gun battle with about a dozen crooks. They have a machine gun and tons of pistols as well as a helicopter. Shaft has a shotgun and a pistol and manages not only to win but shoot down the copter!!! Sadly, it only got worse in SHAFT IN Africa.The main plot idea isn't bad. A group of concerned officials want to infiltrate an evil mob that sneaks illegal workers from Africa into Europe and treats them like slaves. A timely topic now as well as then. However, having Shaft be the guy to infiltrate was just silly. While the film was set in East Africa, Shaft looks little like one of these people--mostly because almost all Black-Americans trace their ancestry back to West Africa--on the other side of the continent. In addition, he didn't really try to use an appropriate accent throughout the film--only once or twice--and he didn't shave or cut his hair to blend in with the slaves. He simply looked like Richard Roundtree Movie Star amidst the poor unfortunate villagers. Unfortunately, about the only thing going for the film is the action and extreme violence (for 1973). Sadly, even the great tune Shaft was gone and the music was rather bland throughout the film! By the way, although it looked cool, why did Shaft bother to blow up the bunker at the end of the film even though the bad guy and all his men were dead?! It just seemed like a silly excuse for pyrotechnics.

According to some reviewers, this is the best of the Shaft films so far. If that was the best of Shaft,  I sure would not waste my time with another Shaft film..Richard Roundtree does a fair job of acting, but the rest of the cast do not show much talent.

Let`s examine the evidence where the black hero dude is a funky sex machine ( Notice how the soundtrack sounds exactly like porno muzak ? ) and where the hero says brother , cat and baby a lot  as in  Yo brother  ,  she`s a hot cat  and  Start talking baby or I`ll break your other arm  , and lets not forget that this movie has black and white villains with the bad guy`s moll having a fetish for black men . You really do get the feeling that if the Nazis had won the war we`d never get to see a film like SHAFT IN AFRICA . Fair enough it`s guilty of playing up to stereotypes but I actually like to see stereotypes now and againThe actual storyline feels more like a James Bond movie than the previous urban thrillers featuring Shaft , it`s somewhat episodic and very bloodthirsty with the hero surviving a muder attempt by a white guy then surving a murder attempt by a black guy then surviving a murder attempt by another white guy . As I said I did enjoy the political incorrectness and the high body count . It`s far better than any of the other SHAFT movies and I`m including the recent Samual L Jackson version      "}]
