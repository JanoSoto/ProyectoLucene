The Rapture tells this story with fascinating insights into the modern Christian perspective and what scares the public about its predictions. Mimi Rogers (in a heart-wrenching performance) plays Sharon, a telephone operator who leads a tedious and extremely boring life by day, but resorts to group sex and orgies to add excitement to her nightlife. She discovers Christianity through people pamphleting at her door and other employees in her office she never cared to talk to before. They use the imagery of a pearl to describe their experience of being saved, and Sharon longs to discover what it is about this religion that can bring fulfillment to her own life.     David Duchovney, before his stint on The X-Files, co-stars as Sharon's boyfriend and later husband she meets through her reckless dates, and whom she induces to join her spiritual quest to find God. After their marriage and birth of their daughter, her faith is tested to intense extemes in ways I would not dare describe, but can honestly say are truly harrowing.      I was surprised that, even though I am a devout Christian, I was not offended by this film, what can be seen as a blatantly sacreligious movie. I think every religious individual should see it to get a better understanding of what they conspire to, as well as how others may conceive of their faith. The Rapture is not a tame flick, and does not shy away from controversial discourse, but all in all, this is a rewarding picture that gets its viewers to think about their lives and what they believe in. No doubt you will be entranced.        Rating Three stars and a half.

Fortunately by then you are so fascinated to find out how it will all end the shortcuts are easy to ignore. This is one you remember. There's a certain type of convert - to religion, politics, you name it - who is so sure of him or herself they just can't ever stop and question whether they've substituted an arrogant certainty where faith and humility should reside.Seldom is this zealotry depicted in film, and if it is usually some secondary character wears the label, all the better to comment on or contrast with the actions of the main characters. Here that character is front and center. The sin of pride born of absolute certainty is Mimi Rogers real co-star. Rogers is so effective here because her zealotry is low-key. She is soft spoken and serene, a lovely woman. Only gradually do we see how deep rooted is her need to understand God in her own way and how convinced she is that she's doing it absolutely the right way.Movies never, ever take a certain type of religious conversion all the way to such a logical conclusion. For me, that's what makes this movie such a stunner. I've always been sorry this film never got it's due in the theatrical release, but the subject matter, coming after an opening act glimpse of Rogers' empty sexual adventuring, probably made it a double whammy for timid theater owners. If it were released next week somehow I don't think it would be nearly as ignored as it was. I only made an effort to see it because Roger Ebert paid it some special attention in his review, and I'm glad I did. This movie needs a DVD release, because it definitely is an overlooked and memorable film that should prompt many a conversation about worthwhile matters of the spirit.As I write this there is a certain amount of criticism of Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby coming from various corners, including one film critic who claims that Hollywood dislikes religion. The Rapture seems to me a perfect example of a movie designed to start useful discussions about what it means to be outwardly religious in an us vs. them mindset rather than truly, inclusively spiritual. I don't recall any public commentary about this movie when it came out at all, yet I'd say it is far more the provocative of the two.

She is incandescent in her belief, and in the movie's final scenes, takes on the epic proportions of a Job or  King Lear.

The film takes on a HUGE subject (the price of devotion) in a very direct and simple way, and truly brought me inside the heroine's world. I think a lot of us can identify with Sharon's yearning to get something more out of life; I mean, who can claim this is really the best of all possible worlds? (Look around!) The scene where Sharon breaks down after showering in scalding water, weeping that she's tired of all the pain and emptiness, is unforgettable. Mimi Rogers plays the part with complete conviction, and I especially like her glowing serenity in the middle section in which she's saved. (The actress' delivery is occasionally a bit flat, but I actually think that's brilliant. Roger's isn't playing a rocket scientist, just a lost, ordinary woman.) As for the poster who made the brilliant observation that the character looks just as bored and unfulfilled by random group sex as she is by answering telephones all day, um, that's the point. In the first group sex scene Sharon enjoys herself, yet she eventually leaves the swingers scene when she feels unfulfilled.I also love the sequence where the born-again Sharon is at work, proselytizing The Word to people who've only called Directory Assistance for phone numbers. (Well I'm sure you're in a hurry, but don't you think you could take time out to get to know your Lord and Savior?) The scene where Sharon tells her old party pal that she's met a really great guy (Jesus) is priceless as well, and the scene where she's pulled over by a cop near the end and breaks down is extremely powerful.The film does look a little low budget, especially near the end, but it's a movie about ideas and emotion, not spectacle. It's a thoughtful and thorough film, with an articulate point of view that doesn't judge its characters who enjoy evangelical faith...which is rather unlike the judgmental view of the God we're usually presented with.

But what would be EVEN MORE frightening what if the religious zealots depicted in the film, what if they turned out not to be misguided or wrong in their beliefs but to be RIGHT that the Book of Revelations actually WILL come true! This is what makes the film so terrifying.The very final scene where the 2 remaining characters, Will Patton and Mimi Rogers are in Heaven, shows that in the end even though the world has ended and the coming of the Apocalypse has passed, and the Second Reign of Heaven has come, that in the end, the Mimi Rogers character finally realizes that in spite of her previous choices, that she decides human free will and the right to question, to choose (i.e. free speech) must be paramount, EVEN if this means she is condemned to purgatory forever.So she chooses NOT to embrace God, this is why Will Patton suddenly vanishes, he chooses to and goes to Heaven, but she allows her earlier doubts, about how God can allow evil and suffering, to prevent her from accepting God as the Saviour. She accepts He exists, but will not follow Him.So THIS is the film's ultimate message that human freewill may triumph even against the strongest powers.I know this may be hard to accept, but it does not make the film anti-Christian but thought provoking.I am Catholic and was not offended by the film at all, as it raises important issues. What is sad is that it is clear from previous comments on this site is that it went straight over many people's heads.Read more, attend more University courses, is my advice.

SHAME, SHAME, SHAME on you for marketing the home video of this very important film as if it were a soft-core sex romp. The original artwork for the film captured its essence very well (the soundtrack on CD has the original artwork), but the VHS video box cover on the front shows Mimi Rogers looking like she had the biggest...well, you know...sexual thrill of her life. The back cover shows a shirtless David Duchovny (but with a look on his face like a deer caught in the headlights). The cover says exploring a woman's sexual and spiritual awakening. Excuse me, but Mimi Rogers' character seems to already be well educated in sex by revealing that she likes to swing with friend Patrick Bauchau. Sure, there is some sex in the first part of the film, but the story as a whole is 95% about the spiritual part. I'd love to yell at the person who got the job of marketing that cover and say how it really is an insult to people's intelligence in general. The Current DVD cover unfortunately makes it look like a religious family film...a big mistake. Should have kept the original artwork (again, see the soundtrack CD cover for that).NOW, for the praise. The Rapture is one of those rare films that refuses to compromise and doesn't apologize if it offends one's religious beliefs. Mimi Rogers is a telephone operator with a very unremarkable life. Even her sexual experiences with her friend seem to be boring her. She eventually overhears co-workers talking about The Boy and she is intrigued by the secrecy surrounding him. She eventually gets involved with this religious group and as time passes, gets married, has a daughter, and continues her religious life. Then things get a bit....bizarre. It leads to a conclusion that may anger those who are devout and get a a lot of respect from those that feel there are many things we just shouldn't settle for in our existence.I'm not an Academy Award nut, but the fact that Mimi Rogers was overlooked for a nomination is sacrilege...excuse me, but in reviewing something like this film some puns are inevitable! The one scene that most everyone I know refers to specifically is the one where Mimi confesses a crime to policeman Will Patton on the side of a road. Watching her emotional pain as she cries out how she can't love God anymore tears me up every time I see it, and it leaves you in a weakened state for the rest of the film. And the rest of the film will have you in a state of amazement right through to its fade. I was so impressed by the uncompromising conclusion and while some may feel that maybe Mimi didn't really win in the end, I feel she did. I too want to know why people think God solely has us here to worship, worship, worship -- at one point Mimi even asks co-workers Isn't that a bit selfish? While we don't get the answers we seek in this film, at least it challenges our minds and gets us talking. I can't recall any other film that has an effect to such an extent as The Rapture. Whether you are very serious in your religious beliefs or are open to all sides of discussion, The Rapture will unnerve, exhilarate, and leave you truly touched in some way.

Since I had never heard of this film before I saw it, I did not know what to expect. It started off very bleak, with amazing dialogue, and as the film goes by it's tone changes. The film also forces us to hear it out, to witness the distressing things that this woman does, yet she is not a villain in any way. The scary thing is that there are actually people like this out there in the world. Here we go back to the focus of the film, God. Obviously a film like this will never get unanimous approval because of the religious subject matter, and because people always have different opinions. Some will agree with the lead character, some might see where she is coming from, others will completely despise her, and in terms despise the film. However, one thing is certain, the film is coming from a group of very talented people. Technically, the film is brilliant, the cinematography very focused and 'normal' at the right time and in the end it shows us another side of the film.I do not really understand the ending, but this is a film that goes where rarely any films go, and should be seen by anyone. I am surprised I had never heard of it, and while many will disagree because of the actual focus of the film, I think it is really something great.

I've always thought it was as much an indictment of fundamentalist Christianity, as pro-Christian. Consider this if it is such a pro-Christian film, why does the protagonist unapologetically refute Christianity at the end? And ask yourself will this film really convert any non-believers? (Mimi Rogers' character begins the film empty inside, and ends the film just as empty-- that will hardly convince anyone who is looking for answers.) The Rapture presents a simplified version of the millennial view that fundamentalist Christians believe and so fundamentalists see it as pro-Christian. Conversely, if you come to this film as an atheist or agnostic you will get all the bitter distaste religion already gives you in spades. I suspect anyone with a purely open mind (including non-fundamentalist Christians) will come away confused, and ponder the film for some time (indeed, that's how I felt the first time I saw it).This film was the first to give me the notion that fundamentalist Christians have essentially given up on this world, and can't wait for The Rapture Mimi and her co-believers have a bunker mentality, they gather together, listen to the young prophet, perhaps try to convert others, and are filled with joy that the world is coming to an end (are their lives that empty that they can't wait for the world to end?) I was reminded of this again recently (in 2006) when Israel attacked Hezbollah in Lebanon, and hundreds of posts appeared on Christian message boards from Christians who felt like dancing because they thought it was the beginning of the end. Such a small view of God. I would think God was infinite, and thus the universe were infinite, rather than revolving around one tiny planet, with everything predetermined, and the end coming like a carefully crafted stage-play, with the true believers cowering before the Lord, praying that their sinful neighbors all go to Hell.

It tells the story about Sharon, a telephone operator who lives in a free relationship with a man named Vick where swapping partners has become their only pleasure. All of the sudden Sharon begins questioning her immoral lifestyle and after meeting some evangelists who claims that the lord is about to return and that Armageddon is coming, she begins feeling empty inside. In an attempt to find something to fill her void, she decides to try an achieve salvation through joining a religious subculture.Subtly and intimately directed by American filmmaker Michael Tolkin, this finely paced fictional tale which is narrated mostly from the protagonist's viewpoint draws an engaging portrayal of a woman's sudden religious awakening. While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions, fine production design by production designer Robert Standefer, cinematography by Montenegrin cinematographer Bojan Bazelli and use of light, this character-driven and narrative-driven independent film depicts a dense study of character and contains a prominent score by American composer Thomas Newman.This scrutinizing depiction of religious faith from the early 1990s about a free-spirited woman's limitless spiritual journey which is an at times comically exaggerated and somewhat satirical mystery drama, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, substantial character development and the involving acting performance by American actress Mimi Rogers.

Despite the fact that the film is based on Revelations this is NOT a preachy film. The events are almost as mundane as her 411 operator job. People still going to work, swimming in the pool, going to meetings, driving on errands. This is a film about what might happen if the end of the world took place today but in a low key fashion.No dramatic, splashy special effects, no public panic with people running and looting.

Meanwhile, Mimi began to grow suspicious of the cult, eventually quitting Scientology altogether. Tom's cult handlers, of course, begin to get worried. They tell Tom to divorce Mimi, which Tom obediently does. To keep things quiet, the cult then pays Mimi 10 million dollars hush money. Mimi takes the money and smiles. Tom was getting kind of freaky anyway. Several months later, Mimi meets Michael Torkin (who penned The Player). Together they make a film about the falsity of religion.In The Rapture, Mimi Rogers plays a woman called Sharon. Sharon's life is existentially empty, she's depressed, unfulfilled and every night she has wild sex with a different stranger.Everyone in Sharon's life speaks of a mysterious pearl. A pearl that pops up in their dreams and promises them access to heaven (so long as they wait patiently). But Sharon remains outside of their club. She's never had this dream. She's never seen the pearl. She's never been touched by the hand of God. One day, Sharon is approached by a pair of Christian evangelists. They are happy and content and both wear smiles on their faces. Sharon wants their happiness, and so she begins her journey to grow closer to God. She starts reading her Bible and within a matter of weeks, becomes a die hard evangelist. She's a different person now. A smiling robot, devoted to Christ, always thinking and talking about baby Jesus.Flash forward 6 years, and Sharon has a family. Her husband and child are both ultra religious, believing that the end will soon come. They eagerly await being taken up to heaven. Unfortunately, one day Sharon's husband dies. This devastates everyone, but Sharon remains calm. This is all part of God's plan, she believes.Sharon gets a message from God, telling her to go to the desert. She takes her kid and together they wait in the wilderness for the creator. A sheriff finds them, alone and starving, and offers to take them home. But Sharon turns him away, her faith strong. God will come, she says. God will come! Sharon waits and waits and eventually it becomes apparent that nothing will happen. She decides to force God's hand. She takes out a gun and sacrifices her child, killing her daughter so that the girl at least may go to heaven.Sharon is in jail. She still believes in God, but now has a total hatred for him. God is a bastard, she says. She is sitting in prison when the Biblical Rapture occurs. The jail doors open, a horse gallops in and she's taken to Purgatory. Here she has a choice love God and be granted access to heaven, or deny him and remain in limbo. She chooses limbo, because she can never forgive God for the grief and hardship he caused her. The film ends.5/10 - The film's first 15 minutes are great in a sleazy sort of way, but then things get preachy. Why make Sharon a total whore at the start of the film? Where's the subtlety? Judging from The Rapture and The Player, Michael Torkin sees himself as a bit of a satirist. The problem is, he has no concept of abstraction. His films have no distance from reality, instead they're realistic satires, treading this awkward ground between smug preaching and realism. Either ditch all the heavy handed allegories and mystique and treat Sharon as a realistic character or go all our and embrace the silliness of the subject matter.Either way, the film is best watched and understood as Mimi poking fun at Scientology for ridding her of her fruitcake micro husband.

They are just confused by the acid bath of the secular influence of the ME culture we all live in. I think we are all too eager to accept any excuse to indulge ourselves, me included, and we tend to mistake PRIDE as rugged individualism which we naturally find virtuous. Sharon can't understand that her sexual indulgence and her pride in her new-found virtue are both flights from the acceptance of the higher power that is the only way to the almost unknowable Divine.The last thing in the world that concerned me in this film was the running out of money in the latter scenes. I think the whole film could have been shot in a black box stage like DOGTOWN and been just as powerful. The sound is particularly wonderful. And Mimi Rogers performance was astonishing.We Christians of all denominations are all too eager to accept cheap grace and forgiveness without racking our brains and heart to do our best to accept our own failings... and some of us like Satan and Sharon prefer to pick a fight with God as a last resort to facing our pride.I found the film mesmerizing. If anything can remind us of why Christ's sacrifice was necessary in the face of human intractability, this film can. There is no way we can redeem ourselves without accepting it.It is a classic Medieval Mystery Play set in a comparable 20th century medium showing everyman in torment as Sharon with her soul in peril. And this viewer was as humbled by it as a superstitious, illiterate peasant in a feudal age kept from the mysteries of the high altar by the rood screen and given a revelation through a popular cultural event it was thought correctly he would better understand. It was truly art in the service of the mystery of the Holy Spirit we can only see through a glass darkly.But I have no doubt that the Hound of Heaven will visit Sharon many times in many ways in the cold eternal Hell she has condemned herself to, for grace abounds... and this story is far from over as the film ends.

After all it is a movie about religion. Note that I said, this is 'about religion', this is not a pious 'religious film' that is set about by one fundamentalist idea and then closes the door.The movie features one of the best, bravest performances I've ever seen. It is provided by Mimi Rogers as Sharon, a telephone operator who works in the new world of global communication &#x96; infinite communication with the minimum of personal interaction. Her nights are just as impersonal, she cruises cocktail lounges with her lover looking for partygoers to swing with. They have wild sex parties with very little personal interaction.One day around the office water cooler she overhears coworkers discussing a strange dream about a floating white pearl. She also learns that those who have had the dream have huddled around a young black boy who is speaking about the end of the world.Sharon throws off her swinger lifestyle (done in a scene where she gets out of bed and changes the sheets) and is born again. Years pass and she marries a former lover who also finds God and they have a child together. Now, for any other film this would be enough but Tolken is just getting started.After a devastating event, Sharon thinks that she has received a sign from God telling her to go the desert and wait there. And she waits and she waits and she waits. Scorching under the hot sun Sharon and her daughter grow impatient. After several weeks, Sharon eventually tests God in an act so shocking that I wondered even up the last second, if Tolken would go through with it.I won't say anymore but I will say that the movie goes all the way in its literal depiction of the rapture (Tolken is at the mercy of low budget special effects but we get the point). The ending of the movie is confounding. Not in a bad way but in a way that leaves people in a heated discussion. Many directors would have taken the easy way out and compromised with over-sentimentality.After seeing the movie that first time in late 1991, I sat outside the theater and tried to figure out what I had just seen. I eventually chose 'The Rapture' as the best film of 1991 because what I had realized was that I had seen a movie that didn't enrage, frustrate or challenge me like any other movie.

That movie does both things really, which also does make the movie more or less unpredictable, which is however also a positive thing though of course. Perhaps this was also exactly what the film-makers were aiming for; confuse its viewers so that they can openly question and think about things and get into discussions with each other.

This is a great power that this movie has and the foremost reason why I actually ultimately ended up liking it, even though I didn't always understood what was going on exactly.This is a bit of a problem with the movie. It gets a quite messy one at times and due to its storytelling, we have to take a lot of things for granted. Not everything feels- and flows naturally, which doesn't always make this the most believable movie.But perhaps it feels a bit off and odd just because the movie is taking such an original approach and features an unique concept in it. Because of that it is hard to compare this to anything we know and are familiar with. It's just a one of a kind movie that you should also take that way.

A pre-X-files David Duchovny brings depth to the potentially-thankless role of the former thug that Rogers becomes determined to save, a role that is fleshed out immeasurably by Duchovny's disarming matter-of-fact portrayal. The delightfully smarmy Patrick Bauchau is hilariously smug as Rogers' fellow swinger, while fresh-faced child actress Kimberly Cullum handles several extremely difficult, emotionally-heavy scenes with a deft authority that betrays her tender age.The film makes the unusual transition from gritty character study to full-throttle apocalypse fantasy, but Tolkin manages to keep everything feeling realistic and believable. The film contains an array of discrete-yet-stimulating optical effects and scene compositions, all of which enhance the human story instead of distracting from it. Praised by open-minded critics and audiences, but shunned by many conservative types, THE RAPTURE is a moving and thought-provoking experience that manages to be dark, humorous, touching, and disturbing. It has a sort of brilliance that we see too little of in the film-world today.

Among these are an even rarer breed, films which mesmerize the viewer, sometimes for no other reason than the provocative subject matter. I suppose, since such films ARE so rare, this creates the attraction for the viewer in itself - something different, something rare, something we're not used to seeing. Nowadays, such rarity is a product of some new, unseen special effect, some new computer visual. In this film, however, it's a rarely viewed idea, an unrealized thought, a theory or premise never before presented. It, the idea, revolves around religion, which, even more so than politics, is usually cause for arguments, killings, and all-out war. For most viewers, potential and past, the story can be at least slightly disturbing and even frightening. It goes to the core of existence - its meaning or lack thereof. Such a concept, as already mentioned, is not something most film-watchers are expecting and may not even be prepared for. You are forced to think by the time it's over.If your main goal in life at the moment is finding out how many characters you can kill in your new video game, this movie is not for you. Even so, this may be the type of film which could awaken certain thinking processes in an otherwise blank slate. It's confounding in a way because anyone from a devout Christian to a steadfast atheist can view this and gain some appreciation for what the film is trying to say. I'm not going to go into the details of the plot as anyone can get that elsewhere and, besides, I believe it's better for any individual to see this without too many preconceptions or slanted viewpoints beforehand. Perhaps this is why it is so confounding you realize we ARE all individuals, with our own fears, desires and beliefs, when such a film generates different reactions & debate from each viewer. There may be similarities, sure, but there is always at least a slight deviation in each person's outlook. And there are so many layers to all the questions and facets of the film the relationship between God and human beings; the limits, if any, of human responsibility vs. that of God; the nature of human sin - is there any actual sin? These are just for starters, beyond the more basic questions of what actually happens to us after death.The lead character here (Rogers) undergoes an odyssey and a personal evolution beyond anything ever seen on film. It's a character arc, I would think, any actor would sell their soul for. Rogers carries it off and it's astounding that not more people are aware of this performance. By the end, the viewer is stuck with her, mesmerized. What's her next move? If you're a Christian, you may lean towards the theory she's in hell, baby. If you're an atheist, you may think, she's hallucinating all this out of grief and madness. Either way works, doesn't it? Confounding.

Mimi kills her kid to send her to heaven, rather than waiting for the rapture that's supposedly just around the corner anyway, and then gets PO'd at God.

I understand that this movie has many different interpretations, and is seen as a disturbing and confusing film, but I had a very clear take on it from the beginning. I'm not saying my take is right, and it certainly will be opposed, but since an opinion like mine doesn't seem to be posted yet, I thought I'd add it as a new way of looking at The Rapture. Basically, religious fanaticism is bad. Mimi Rogers is unhappy because her life doesn't bring her close to anyone, and that's how a lot of people turn to being fanatical about religion ...which she does. (Heck, we even hear what her reasons are; That she wants something more from life, and doesn't know how to get it until she's reminded about the idea of Judgement Day. Can the message that turning fanatical is a weakness be any more clear...?) Then, she preys on another victim; David Duchovini, who's weak-minded due to the guilt of murdering someone and, therefore, is easily convinced. (This is made clear by her Christian propaganda advertising over the phone, right?) Moving on, she totally can't mourn his death. She's spaced out in spiritual dogma. You know this is trouble, and it's only confirmed by her own hallucinations. (What, you think those pictures of David Duchovini in the desert were suppose to be real?? Like there were actually photos of her husband in the desert in the store somehow?? They were imagined by her from being unable to mourn! She's losing her marbles, obviously! How else do you explain that?! Come on, what other explanation do you have? We know it's not a glorious sign from a good-natured God, because of the conclusion to such a siting.)Now, we all know taking a child to a desert for weeks straight is a terrible idea, but she's already in the hole that is devout Christianity, and would have to be a weak character to get out now. But the hole of devout religion is much deeper than this, because it demands that she starve the child while waiting, set a bad example by stealing from drive-thru in front of the child, forcing her child to live off of candy bars in neglect for proper tooth-care, sacrifice her child like Abraham in the Bible was willing to just to end the young one's suffering, and bear the pain of living with that guilt ultimately to give her heart to the Lord that put her through this. That's what I think the movie is saying - That the price of dedication to religion is too high a price for reality, as we know it, to bare. I mean, what choice does she have? If she's faithful, she'll go to the desert, or else she's just 'ignoring God's sign.' But if she goes to the desert she's obviously screwed. So, what choice does her faith give her? Basically, if she believes in it, she's screwed, like so many people have become on the news in those trials of court.Next, we get a final confirmation that fanaticism is unhealthy for the individual and society. The devout Christian who always pleas his last attempt with, Watch, you'll be sorry when Judgement Day really comes!, is silenced. In this story, Christianity is real, Judgement Day does come, and we see the ultimate horrors and cruelty that religious fanatics have been advertising to us as 'good.' Mimi Rogers not only has to think well of killing her child, but do the impossible which is let God into her heart. She has just been given the impression that God is some deceiving, merciless, despotic tyrant, and she must let him into her heart in a limited amount of time immediately proceeding her tragic sufferings. Why? Oh, because Judgement Day has 'conveniently' occurred on that same day, and as we've been told so many times about Judgement Day, God will wait for no one by then.So, I'm not badgering religion or anything. I believe all religions can be good or bad, depending on one's interpretation of it. But, for reasons just stated, I feel this movie is attempting to show how extreme religious views are impossible ideals that can never bare fruit, even IF they end up becoming true. I give this movie a 10 because not only do I agree with this statement, but because no other film expresses this so powerfully.

It will never attain the accolades heaped upon high profile successes like Chinatown or 2001, but, in terms of ambition and achievement this film belongs in their company. Like those other films, The Rapture is an uncompromising cinematic exploration of spirituality and existence in late-20th century America.Through the central character of Sharon, writer-director Michael Tolkin examines the jaded ennui to which many succumb. Sharon seeks solace in the arms and loins of others the way some people turn to chemical dependence or fundamentalism. Finding the embrace of her lovers lacking the vitality she needs, Sharon finds God in the vision of a rotating, heavenly pearl. Flash forward--the apocalypse is nigh and, following the death of her husband (another reformed sinner), she treks to the desert, daughter in tow to await Jesus's return. Ultimately, Sharon finds herself on the precipice between paradise and eternal loneliness; she chooses solitude.What is ultimately remarkable about this film is the way in which it doesn't reject the tenets of fundamentalist Christianity; it engages these beliefs in a respectful but critical dialogue and leaves the viewer to decide where they stand. Belief in the rapture is not dismissed--Tolkin buys into it for the sake of his film and allows his characters to encounter the end days. A lesser movie would have undermined the final 20 minutes by explaining it away as delusion. Tolkin does no such thing. In The Rapture, the verity of the apocalypse is never explicit, but there is little within the film to offer a notion that it's simply Sharon's imagination. Or a lesser movie would have found Sharon reuniting with her deceased husband and daughter. She would have chosen to submit herself at the end, ascending, like Deputy Foster.That's the point of the movie, though, and the mark of Sharon's progression as a character--she moves away from submission to independence. At the beginning, she is a slave to men, following Vic out on his nightly prowls. Finding that lacking, she turns to another man--Jesus--in the hopes that he will fill her with the sense of purpose she desires. Upon killing her only child, she realizes that this man too has left her empty and caused her to lose the only thing in her world that mattered. In the end, Sharon chooses independence and stand alone, surrounded by the void. It's an incredibly liberating denouement (for women) and an intriguing premise.It's all the more interesting in that it does this without taking pot-shots at religious faith. In my reading, the movie does not fault Christianity or any religion--it faults the people that blindly look to some crutch for happiness in guidance before finding it in themselves. In other words, first know thyself, then know God.

He has a very interesting possibility relating to the role of religion as yet another alternative to drab existences. He also has an opportunity to delve into the compelling world of religious fanaticism and the kinds of forces that would prompt a mother to kill her child. Tolkin's movie offers tip of the iceberg glimpses of both themes but ultimately fails to deliver real satisfaction on either score.I'll address the religious theme first. Many reviewers seem to think that the religious group that Sharon (Mimi Rodgers) joins is a fundamentalist Christian sect, portrayed in a non-judgmental way. Some of the beliefs depicted in the film do share points of contact with American fundamentalist Christian groups, but nothing more than that. The emphasis on the importance of the mysterious child, for example, is not something that any fundamentalist Christian group would espouse. Similarly, the lengthy exposition of the pearl of great price is not a major point for American fundamentalists. Therein lies part of the problem with Tolkin's take on American religion. He seems to want to portray a fundamentalist sect, but gets the details rather garbled and ends up with a mishmash of ideas and beliefs which individually can be found in some identifiable Christian groups, but are nowhere found in the combination in which they are presented in this film. Rightly, many fundamentalist Christian groups were highly offended by this caricature of true believers. Sharon is a born again Christian in no sense other than the sense created by Tolkin for purposes of making the movie. Being true to a particular version of American Protestant Christianity is beside the point, however, and that's why Tolkin would have been better advised to avoid some of the mangled theology he attempted to present and focus instead on the dynamics of fanaticism. Clearly, there is no more fanatical act than killing one's own young child for the sake of religious belief. Yet that theme is not only present in this film, it also presents itself in one of the oldest recorded tales of the Hebrew Bible (or Old Testament to Christians). In the book of Genesis, the story is told of Abraham being ordered by God to sacrifice his son, Isaac. Abraham does not understand the command. God gave Isaac to Abraham and his wife, Sarah, in their old age and promised Abraham that Isaac would carry forward the promise of God to Abraham to make a great people of Abraham's descendants. In the biblical story, God tests Abraham and Abraham proves faithful. He carries out every preparatory step to sacrifice Isaac to God, but then God calls off the killing of Isaac and provides a lamb for sacrifice instead. In Tolkin's vision, God does not call off the sacrifice. The question is, did God call for it in the first place? Of course it was the little girl who came up with the idea, but what kind of adult would agree to the scheme?There's the religious story of this movie that Tolkin leaves largely untouched. For the sake of space, I won;t launch on the rapture itself. Suffice it to say that Tolkin chose to depict those events in a manner fairly close to the literal unfolding as presented in the Book of Revelation. I am curious as to what Tolkin thought was happening in those scenes. There are many fundamentalists who adhere to the notion that a literal unfolding of the events depicted in Revelation is bound to happen. They also maintain, however, that true believers will be taken up into heaven either before anything bad happens, or in the midst of the evil events, or not until the very end (pre-Tribulation rapture vs. mid-Tribulation rapture vs. post-Tribulation rapture). While Tolkin could not let himself get bogged down into those sometimes obscure details, Sharon's continued presence on earth would suggest to the pre-tribulation rapture believers that Sharon was not a true believer at all. Finally, I wanted to address the other theme in this movie that Tolkin failed to follow through to its conclusion. That is the theme of monotony. At the beginning of the film, Sharon is depicted as being stuck with a mind-numbing repetitive job with long-distance information. In an effort to bring some excitement in her life, she engages in a random acts of sexual adventure with multiple partners. But in the main scene depicting such an encounter, Sharon looks just as bored and unfulfilled by random group sex as she is by answering telephones all day. Into that mix comes this life-changing religious conversion. The fascinating question would have been whether that new life would also have bogged down into monotony had it carried on for a time. Tolkin does not probe that issue, suggesting instead that perhaps religious fanaticism is the answer to boredom in life.

First, the movie will come off as nothing but gratuitous, casual sex flick with a God message in the end.  I have seen it multiple times and I have to say that it is the underlined message that one has to realize is there before one can really engage into a conversation of debate about this film.  Acting set aside, this comes off as a B-rated Cinemax late night film.  I personally get a message of a person who is so lost in her life that she doesn't care about anything..her life is a one-way to nowhere..no matter if she is a swinger, phone operator, or what..it's still nowhere, so why care.  The bible-beater door-to-door people open her eyes to something better. Whether or not it is..remains to be seen.  For someone who has seen rock bottom, there only one way up, so why not God?  Suddenly, she has a new respect for herself and for others.  She feels something for the first time..she realizes love, compassion, and empathizes.  Her new life is wonderful until the mysterious God decides to throw a wrench into the works.  Or fate..human nature of free-will gets in the way, however you'd like to look at it. Husband is gone and the church sends her out to wait.  Waiting can be so unbearable...ever waited for a restroom and decided it might be better to go behind a building?  Her compassion and faith is running thin and without food, water, money..her struggles make her think there is only one way out. Daughter gone..and she decides if I do it, I'll go to Hell (according to the bible) or is she just chicken because our own personal life is one that we don't like to give up to easily.  So, what's her next thought..I have lost faith..if there was a God..how could I have done this?  Why me?  Apocalypse is upon us (which I thought was neat how the effect was brought on) and the concept of I believe that Jesus died for our sins..God made me and loves me no matter what..will let me into Heaven. Up we go..we are saved.  Aren't we saved when the door-to-door bible people come to us and ask and we go to their religion openly?  The whole kicker of the film is How long will you wait?  There is no answer..can we say that to..how long have wars gone on in the name of God..how many times have we lost faith (not necessarily in God, but in our own lives, family, friends..etc)  This movie can be taken on so many levels..especially if you avoid the blatant religious aspect.  How long will it take us to forgive ourselves for something we cannot expect to be forgiven?  Main question, main plot of the story in my opinion.

What we also get is a lopsided sermon on the hard-line lessons of the Bible, without much in the way of counterpoint.Which warrants a warning to all non-believers this movie will beat you over the head with the line 'Love God', along with other arbitrary notions of religion (e.g. Mommy? Where's heaven? In the sky.). As such, sitting on my couch felt like being trapped in a cultish, Can I Get an Amen sort of rural church, with my mom holding my wrist down so I couldn't flee out the back door.What this movie lacked, and which Mimi Rogers demonstrates so well in the final act, is the notion of faith in the face of overwhelming doubt. Instead of portraying Sharon as the insightful and thoughtful Christian, Tolkin asks her to embrace the ultimately doomed notion of blind faith. Ironically enough, that tends to be the quickest way to see the light--that of cold reason and reality.To have painted Sharon as a more compelling traveler on the road to faith would have quickly turned this into a masterpiece.

Hollywood is as un-ambivalent as it is unapologetic on this point Women who are incapable of looking younger than 32 are consigned to one level or another of TV Hell commercials (Why is Janine Turner selling pills on TV every morning?!), made for TV films, supporting roles in remakes of old TV series, and perhaps at its grisliest, in Watersesque grotesque parodies of aging housewives and minxes.

I thoroughly enjoyed this nonsense.Why nonsense? Tolkin sets up the story of a confused, unintelligent, very gullible, emotionally unstable woman (suffering possibly from depression or even worse mental illnesses) who one day decides to join a rather silly religious cult which only the most desperate among the mentally weak ever would. We watch her plummet into ever bigger depths of stupidity and lunacy, and then &#x96; voilà &#x96; as if witnessing a truly zany Loony Toons cartoon, a bombastic (joke?) ending wraps up the proceedings. Yes, an ACTUAL Armageddon. So it turns out she was right all along. O tempora, o mores!So far so good, right? If Tolkin wanted to make a pro-Christian drama (sort of like the extremely idiotic but well-made Song of Bernadette) then he did a very solid job, all things considering (i.e. the monumentally impossible task of bringing all that millennia-old illogic together to make any kind of sense). Right? Wrong. As if the Armageddon itself weren't goofy enough, Tolkin took it one notch further, going as far as to totally deconstruct his own logic, or whatever purpose he might have had (and only God knows what that may have been). Mimi finally gets the end of the world which she so craved (and BTW, why do all these religious nuts look forward so much to billions dying in a flashy apocalypse? isn't that kind of blood-thirsty?), but so utterly disgusted was she with the murder of her daughter that she cannot forgive God and refuses to even utter a simple lie (yes, I love you God) in order to have her eternal fun in Paradise.So what is there to conclude from this bizarre turn of events? There are only a handful of options.1) Tolkin was high when he tacked on that goofball ending.2) The movie was one big joke, Tolkin trying to see how far he can take a nonsense ending without too many people noticing it.(No? Well, then (3) is the only explanation left.)3) The message of the movie is the following even though God does exist, and Christians were right all along, and young black kids who whisper things into adults' ears about the Second Coming of Christ are always right and never deluded - in spite of ALL this - you should NOT kiss the a** of the Almighty One when you find yourself in purgatory. What Mimi essentially does is give God the middle finger for putting her through all that mental anguish during her earthly existence. But couldn't she just have lied to God about loving Him, as her dead daughter had begged her to do? Well, no. It was a matter of principle, you see. Mimi is nothing if not a woman with a stern moral sense. (How else could she kill her own daughter?) She chose an eternity in the purgatory (read ETERNITY) just because she wouldn't kiss the Almighty's behind one last time! I mean, it's not as if she hadn't been kissing it for the six previous years, dozens of times every single day, so why couldn't she just go past her hurt feelings and bitter disappointment (that God is just a tyrannical old geezer) and tell God she loves Him so she could join her daughter and Duchovny in Paradise?Questions upon questions, questions which Tolkin could not possibly answer. The movie contradicts itself on so many levels (much like the Great Book itself, nice touch), that it makes a mockery of any serious point that it could have possibly wanted to convey, whether pro-religious or anti-religious. Ultimately, TR should be mocked by both believers and non-believers, not praised, because it sends mixed signals. I have no doubts that Tolkin isn't an utter moron, but it's just as abundantly obvious that he isn't the great intellectual mind that any of us should be going to in order to find any kind of answers to some serious age-old questions. Tolkin's message must be this the Christians are right, yes, God does exist, but pleeeeease don't kiss His exalted b*tt when you die because He doesn't deserve it. He tortures us during our brief time on Earth and then actually expects us to do that again when we die! To that Tolkin says F*** no! No way, Jose! Not me!You have got to love the little girl's simple logic. She presses on about the most basic Christian dogma, asking tricky questions no religious fanatic parent wants to hear, exposing the dogma's nonsense to the (intelligent) viewer (though who the Hell knows what Tolkin was thinking), and poor, ever-suffering Mimi is at a loss for words, unable to respond to her daughter's demands, such as the one that they commit suicide, thereby taking a shortcut to Heaven. Well, Mimi is so utterly disturbed, lost and confused by this point (six years without any medication may have brought her over the edge), that she ends up taking her daughter's suggestion at face value, and blows her brains out all over the desert.Which brings us to the (remote) possibility that the entire fantasy-based Revelations/Armageddon/White-Horses-Stomping-Around Grand Ending was all in Mimi's mind, that she'd imagined it all. In this case Tolkin would be absolved from all sin, at least the sin of writing an absurd ending, which is usually the greatest sin of them all in Movie La-la Land, at least to those of us who care about logic. Nevertheless, Tolkin also achieves the most important aim in Movie La-la Land, and that is to entertain the viewer.Mimi Rogers has a spectacular pair.

In Mimi Rodgers' stunning performance, we are given a protagonist who goes from a joyless, orgiastic life of group sex, to a rigid, conservative Christian belief, and ultimately, an angry rejection of that belief. Every viewer will interpret her actions and the story's theme differently, but one way of looking at it is that her character Sharon gets mad at God for not doing things her way, completely overlooking the possibilities of free will, human evil, and just plain bad luck. The fact that the events near the end of the story take place in the desert, combined with Sharon's bitter remark that she will give God one more chance,suggest the New Testament story of Christ's temptation in the desert. The devil proposes a series of challenges, and Jesus responds at one point by quoting an Old Testament verse about not putting the Lord thy God to a foolish test.Later, Sharon bitterly denounces God for supposedly having broken his promise, but the fact is, she is responsible for all the suffering endured by her daughter and herself, and blames it on God.It is possible to see her as a person who has so denied her grief over her husband's death, that she has become delusional. The people in her religious group ask her how she can be sure that God is calling her out to the desert, and if it might not be a false vision of the devil. One interpretation is that she never really had a mature understanding of her faith to begin with, but had adopted a dogmatic, self-satisfied view of her Christian lifestyle, and was too proud to admit having made a mistake. This is a powerful film that demands a lot from the viewer. It is an unforgettable performance by Mimi Rodgers, and a thoughtful, challenging invitation to ask hard questions about faith.

Without abating the serious gravity of the religious problem too much, these are the sort of logical deductions one encounters in The Rapture, a 1993 film directed by fiction writer (winner of the Edgar Allen Poe Award), Michel Tolkin. A surface-only glance at Tolkin's highly conceived, The Rapture, will invite associations with the not too dissimilar film-making stylistics discoverable in the low-studio-budggie, yet entirely for profit, commercially slick in pitch and tone, and even in the pleasantly familiar cast of, yes indeed, a late-night Skinamax special. But The Rapture, don't let it fool you Girls, is a well wrought little exercise in philosophical reflection on the quest for religious meaning in the context of post-modern US America.Mimi Rogers plays Sharon, an empty-sexed swinger who works in a call-center cube-farm. Approaching forty and dating Vic, a likewise sexually vacant and older by at least a decade balding man that exudes wealth; Sharon is more or less that loopy, a little better than marginally attractive 40ish gal with whom you inadvertently find yourself in the middle of a gleefull but entirely awkward encounter there in your fluorescently lit tenth-floor corporate breakroom lobby; perhaps you're having an all-out bizarre discussion about, oh, I don't know, Have you seen the Pearl? So keeping up with sex-parties (just what is this woman at the desk next to me into?) long enough to meet, David Duchovny, who apparently plays himself in the film, a man with a past and whose best year was 1976, protagonist, Sharon, manages to sway young David, despite his well reasoned, overly rational objections (Some people use heroin. You use God.) over to her religious transformation reform scheme and finally let go of those dirty times before. The two justify their own lives by marrying, having a child, and playing out this drama of a generally boring and implausible suburban lifestyle which stands in direct contrast to the vicissitudes of, how do you say, uh, real life and the kind of visual material you catch on the evening news.It could be that the fulsome couple already played their hand with devil and guess who's back to roost?

While some films contrast black against white in the usual fashion, THE RAPTURE is instead gray all over. Those of you looking for the conventional good conquers evil story will be confused. The morality portrayed in this artistic film is at times murky below sea level and at other times sparse as the desert sky.Several employees at a dark 411 call center experience visions of a pearl in their dreams which they interpret as a sign from God. I can't recall reading anything that associates pearls with conventional Christianity, but I think that's the point. The religion depicted in THE RAPTURE is anything but conventional, and the existential faith adopted by the characters is something you might find in play by Tom Stoppard or Jean-Paul Sartre.Speaking of plays &#x85; How many of you out there are into post-modern stage production? I mean the live on-stage type thing with real actors? If you are, you might be familiar with the nebulous, uneasy feeling of being confronted with dialog that's disjointed and doesn't quite make sense. The acting is based more on the over-emphasized feeling each actor gives to the words than the words themselves. The play culminates in a ritualistic dream sequence that would have even Shakespeare scratching his head. At the end you leave the theater not knowing whether good conquered evil and your head is full of strange thoughts about life.THE RAPTURE incorporates many of these thespian elements on film, and I wonder if it's actually an on-screen adaptation of a play. The sets are normal, bedroom to bedroom to office, and there are rarely more than two people in one shot. There's no stylistic cinematography to speak of, and the cuts and audio track are nothing special. That being the case, I would say that THE RAPTURE would undoubtedly be more effective on stage than on screen. The main reason being that the audience is posed with the question &#x96; is Mimi Rogers going insane? Is she dreaming? What the hell is going on? Now, in Hollywood, dream sequences are a dime a dozen. Anyone with plenty of time on their hands, a computer, and a microphone can pretty much do anything they want on screen. That's why when you rent a movie, you're expecting something artificial. With a theatrical play, on the other hand, what you see on stage is actually happening. The pyrotechnics is real fire. The actors are living breathing human beings.When we step into the Shakespearean theater, although everything you see is a fictional story, the events are physically happening for real in front of your eyes. That's what makes on-stage theater eerily dreamy, because what you're really seeing isn't really happening. With the only thing separating you and the actors being the stage lights, the dream sequences are even more unsettling than their cinematic counterparts. Like a child you sigh, I think I see an angel coming down from heaven, and it's more lifelike and three-dimensional than any possible CGI-rendered figure.My point is, THE RAPTURE attempts this same eerie feeling, but since it's only a movie, it can only do so much, even with its appropriately orchestrated score. It's a question of format. If you ever get to see THE RAPTURE on-stage, don't pass it up. If you're tempted to rent it on video, beware that it might bore you. The suspension of belief and the dues ex ma-china just don't appear.JYJimboduck-dot-com "},{"Title":"A spiritual search in a world of despair","Date":"1 June 2003","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":"  This is one of my favorite movies because it's so unique.  A lot of films dramatize the central character's search for the truth, but The Rapture is different because the truth isn't all that well-defined.  You think you see it, but there are so many false leads, and the movie avoids the normal saccharine ending where conflicts are settled and all is well in the world.Mimi Rodgers plays a telephone operator in Los Angeles who cruises the bars at night with a roguish friend looking for casual sex with other couples.  Her life is empty and eventually she's steered towards becoming a born-again Christian, but does she really make the conversion?  When her husband is murdered and she's directed by the boy prophet in her prayer group to go out into the desert because God has something in mind for her, her beliefs are challenged.  She and her young daughter expect that God is ready to summon them up to Heaven, but after weeks go by and nothing happens, she begins to despair again.  Her daughter wants to die so she can be with her daddy again, so Mimi shoots her but chickens out and can't kill herself.This movie works on several levels, because there's an element of ridicule towards the fundamentalist beliefs of the Christian faith.  There's something absurd about a person believing it's OK to shoot your daughter so she can go to Heaven.  In the strict confines of biblical doctrine, this might be true, but when you see the killing carried out, you naturally pull back and question it.  The boy in the group's prayer circle also seems to be a false lead because his prophecies are cold and misleading to the other people.But, the movie ends with the Apocalypse, with the blowing of Gabriel's horn and the summoning of all the believers to Heaven, so it's not an outright rejection of the fundamental teachings of the Christian faith.   It raises many questions and doesn't answer all of them, which is cool because too many films try to wrap everything up neatly at the end.Mimi Rodgers is terrific as the woman who despairs of the life she's been leading and who tries to find faith in God.  Will Patton plays a kindly police officer who encounters Mimi and her little girl out in the desert and tries to help them.  His innate kindness and willingness to accept what life brings helps him to make the conversion at the end.  But Mimi is still bitter about everything, about being misled to kill her daughter, about her husband's death, about all the rules she has to follow to get to Heaven, that she refuses to let go.There are some very eerie scenes in this movie that stick with you.  The galloping horses of the Apocalypse, the blowing of Gabriel's horn and the jail disintegrating, the little girl pleading with her mommy to accept God, and then Mimi standing all alone in the darkness as she realizes that she's spending forever in the emptiness between Heaven and Hell.I recommend watching this movie late at night when there are no distractions because it will definitely get you thinking.

This film opens in a telephone boiler room where the heroine leads a boring dehumanized existence as Operator 134 who is expected to spend no more than 15 seconds per call. Complaining of emptiness, we watch Operator 134 become a sex addict, but she finds that sex is also empty. Operator 134 then becomes a religion addict.Although religion does lead to her finally becoming Sharon, a person, at work, either work or religion drive her crazy. We see Operator 134 twice point a pistol at her head (a classic workplace joke). She is told to see a therapist, but does not. She is told to see a deprogrammer, but does not. Operator 134 continues her descent into madness and finally murders her child, and appears to wish to murder God.The movie ends with Operator 134 in jail turning over to sleep while asking Who forgives God? (presumably for creating the boiler room and for killing her little girl). The rest of the movie is her dream or nightmare.While the crisis in floss scene is too funny, the scene where the Horseman of the Apocalypse is chasing Operator 134 on a motorcycle is inspired. This film deserved many awards and one hopes that all who see it will be kinder to Information Operators.

She encounters thousands of people a day, most are people she will never know except for their voice. At night Sharon, along with her boyfriend, are going to various bars trying to track down other swingers to bring home for group sex. To Sharon this is the perfect life.She has no problems to deal with and no questions about her life.One day while at work Sharon overhears a group of people talking about the second coming of Jesus Christ. At first she plays this off but while in bed with a guy named Randy (David Duchovny) she begins to think about something. She isn't quite sure what that something is but she rushes to the shower to cleanse herself when it hits her that she should be living her life for Jesus. Within the next six years she eventually marries Randy, has a child and is eventually called to the desert where she believes Jesus will make his second coming and take her home.The Rapture was written and directed by Michael Tolkin and the film is constantly asking if God is just using humans as some sort of plaything. That's one of the key elements to the story and while watching the film I kept asking myself if Token was using the viewers as a plaything. The film opens with casual sex and then leads us on a journey, like life, that is full of ugliness as well as redemption. Up until the end I kept wondering if the director would go all out with his message or if he's leave the viewer at a standstill but thankfully the film manages to ask questions as well as give answers.Since the begin of movie-making there have always been films that dealt with Christianity but quite often I found them to be rather poor money gimmicks that give us answers without asking any serious questions. The Rapture on the other hand takes a very serious look at Religion and those who believe in the power of that it promises. There aren't any cute scenes with Moses nor any scenes with God racing in to save the day but instead, the film makes each person watching make up their own minds. Everyone is going to have a different reaction to the film, the questions it asks you and the answers that it gives.The worst thing in life and in film is that quite often people or directors are so timid that they are afraid to really be honest about anything or ask any questions that they might not like to know the answer to. My grandfather was a preacher and I grew up in a church so it's rather refreshing to see a film like this that shows both sides of the coin without putting either side down. In most films, if you believe in God then you are a saint, no questions asked. If you don't believe then you're automatically looked at as something evil, no questions asked. With this film both sides are looked upon as equal trying to figure a riddle out where there might not be a full answer.With a film like this it really doesn't matter if you agree with what the characters are doing. Again, we're all going to have our own beliefs just like Sharon does in the movie.To say this film reaches a personal level would be a bit of an under statement but I think it's important that each viewer takes away their own answers to the questions asked.Director Tolkin paints a very depressing and sad picture of a woman who changes her life expecting to find something better but finds out that the same problems happen on both sides.Mimi Rogers is an actress I've never really been a fan of but she's does a remarkable job here in a role that could have been one-dimensional. When we first see her she's a bored phone operator who at night is swinging from various sex partners. Rogers does a very good job at showing the careless life the woman is leading but this isn't done with words but instead various body movements as well as a look in her eye. When Sharon is eventually saved we get a different look in her eyes, which makes us believe the characters is having a different look on life. The same can be said in the third act when Sharon enters the desert waiting for the second coming of Jesus.The Rapture is a very bold film in many ways and much like a recently released religious film, it will certainly effect people in different ways. I'm sure many will leave the film hating Sharon and wishing the worst fate upon her while others might believe in what she's does in that final act. It's really impossible to keep your personal beliefs out while watching a movie like this and even though I personally don't agree with some of her choices, that's still not enough to dampen this incredible film that at the very least should get everyone's respect for not playing sides and actually making the viewer think.If religion is suppose to make one think then I can only be thankful that the film allows the viewer to think for themselves and doesn't try forcing a message down our throats.

David Duchovney and Will Patton provide strong support as, respectively, her devoted husband and a compassionate cop. Some very strong scenes, including the murder of a child. The ending arrives a bit unexpectedly, and is open to interpretation. Either the world has literally come to an end or the woman has gone completely bonkers. Either way, it is a surprisingly strong finish, done with a minimum of fuss and money (the budget was running very low at that point, according to published reports).

Starring Mimi Rogers as Sharon, in a film her ex-TC would have no doubt prevented her from doing back in their day, Rogers' character is the stereotypical information operator by day/swinger sin-sister by night. The extreme binary of her character makes for hysterical lines when she decides to convert to a cultish Christianity based on the notion of prophesy. With David Duchovny in an early semi-naked role as the firm, young, stud whom Rogers cavorts and later marries, and Will Patton as a sheriff who encounters the demented Sharon who has followed her faith into the wilderness, the male balance to this film is one of flesh and reason made secondary to literal interpretation of scripture in vacuous gestures of uncritical blind faith without rationale.Frankly, other films have addressed questions of faith and belief in more sophisticated ways than the heavy-handed approach of The Rapture, and it is far more satisfying to compare those with this attempt. While Rogers is lauded for this performance, it is a complex character but the actress interpretation is shallow and so pulled back that it makes for an uneven and superficial read, however, I think this is more the fault of the director than the actress. On first viewing, I thought this film was intriguing, but after several viewings in the interim years, it becomes more laughable and comedic than worthy of intense reflection or serious attention.

Let's see. God and Satan were having a conversation and God claimed he could test any believer without breaking him. I don't remember why he picked Job, a devout man, but, boy, did God test him. (Woody Allan might ask why God didn't give Job a written exam instead.) This is a kind of Job story. I began watching it because, frankly, I was hoping Mimi Rogers might uncover part of her magnificent torso but I stayed because I got caught up in this complex story of a rather simple belief system.Mimi is put to the test too. And there is a sort of cultish group thrown in, made up of people who have seen the light. What does the light look like? According to the script it has something to do with a dream about a pearl. I am being a little vague on this point because the film is vague. (Also I don't know how pearls figure so markedly in a mythos with a desert background.) And the version of Christianity the film present us with is truly primitive. There are constant references to Jesus Christ, although the acts of God we witness reflect the temper of the angrier God of the Old Testament more than the merciful God of the New.How can you be saved? It's easy. You love Jesus Christ and do whatever God orders you too. A reasonable person, as the spouse-swapping Rogers is at the beginning, might ask, The Buddhists seem to get along without Jesus Christ, and the Hindus and Moslems too, and the converted come right back with a smiling answer, But they are not saved. I guess that leaves out the Jews too, although Christians worship the same God, but only through an intermediary, and with different rituals.The movie was especially gripping when Rogers apparently has a vision in which she is to take her daughter to the desert and wait for the end of the world. She takes only the necessities -- no money and no food -- expecting the arrival of Gabriel and the rest at any moment. Her date stands her up. She turns more raggedy with each day and finally does something terrible and is brought to jail by a sheriff's deputy (Will Patton in a sympathetic role for a change).Then the world ends with a minimum of special effects. Her daughter and Patton wind up in heaven, but Rogers is bitter about having been disappointed by God and evidently winds up spending eternity in Purgatory.That's it, folks. I don't know whose side the movie is on -- the born-agains who glow with the inner light of sanctimony, or people like Rogers who find that a God capable of such cruelty is not worth loving unconditionally. I suppose if Heaven is a good idea, it's better to surrender to God, especially if you're looking for an exclusive neighborhood to live in. Yet we're left admiring Rogers for having made up her own mind. She believes fiercely, first in God, and then in her distaste for Him.All the while I kept thinking that this movie deals with the kind of Big Issues that European directors are so fond of. I have a feeling that if it had been shot by the French, the story might have been very similar, beginning with all that ontological Angst, but that the central question would have dealt not with God but with Marx or Marcuse or somebody.

Ever watched the 700 Club? Ever attended a Baptist church service? Ever heard the stories of the addict tell of how Jesus saved him from those chains of death? Ever been quoted John 316, For God so loved the world, he sent his only begotten son, whosoever believeth on him shall not perish but have everlasting life? Yes, the message is that God saves sinners who ask him to be saved, to be either taken up into heaven upon death or be raptured before the beginning to the Great Tribulation.The movie, The Rapture, dramatizes the path to salvation by a female sex addict. The movie asks whether it was a truly spiritual experience or whether it was psychological. Her friend, played by Duchovny, eventually comes to realize that her change was due to an actual experience with the Holy Spirit. He also becomes saved; that is, he accepts Jesus Christ as he Lord and Savior as per John 316. They marry and become witnesses to their neighbors. Even after he is killed, she still retains the faith. She tells her neighbor at a dinner party that God indeed is a comfort in cold and uncaring universe. The implication is that since it is a cold and uncaring universe she had no reason not to stop being a sex addict in the first place. Because, you see, as Bill Gaither wrote, Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.Well, eventually her daughter asks the questionIf God lives in heaven, and since daddy is in heaven, why must I stay here on earth? How come I cannot go to be with daddy and God? Indeed, why not she's got a mansion just over the hilltop  waiting for her, with a room specially prepared for her by Jesus himself, after all. Her mother dispatches her forthwith. Cruel? But to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord is the prize towards which Christians covet.She loved her daughter enough to grant her her wish. She's arrested for the crime. But, keeping true to the faith, she hangs in there, converting her arresting officer. While in the jail, the trumpet blows. Her faith is validated as being the honest and goodness truth. Yet, even with that knowledge she still has the courage to turn God down. On the border between Hell and Heaven, she judges God for not being God enough to be more of a mentor of mankind than judge. She refuses to tell God she loves him just because that's her ticket to Heaven.Any lost (unsaved, not born again) person can find any number of Internet sites (Billy Graham, Jack Chic Tracts, Southern Baptist Convention, 700 Club, just to name a few) to find out how God can put together your meaningless, messed up life resulting from engaging in sin and depravity, from having no purpose or meaningful goal. Upon accepting Christ, you too can be saved, meaning put into your life, and possessing through Christ your one-way ticket to heaven.All you have to do is tell God you love him in the name of Jesus.

I can see a certain amount of positive value in the movie, but also some overwhelming limitations.The key problem with the film is that it presents a profound misunderstanding of the Christian faith.  This is most clearly revealed in three direct statements, all of which occur near the end of the film. Being careful not to reveal anything about the plot, the daughter utters a direct contradiction of a most basic tenet of Christian faith.  She says, God loves us because we love him. (I think that is an exact quote.)  But if you read 1 John chapter 4 (among many other passages in the Bible), you see that this is exactly reversed from the truth.  1 John 4, verse 19 states it most directly, We love, because He God first loved us.  Now, to be true to the passage, the We love refers to our love for other people as well as for God -- but the point still stands.The second revealing comment comes from the main character (Mimi Rogers). She states that God has too many rules -- and that is true, for her confused understanding of God.  But then the film fails to present any corrective to that confusion.  The actual corrective is that when we see that God truly loves us, then we can trust him and we *want* to please him, and his rules become our desires... albeit imperfectly, in this life. Not to mention that she had a bunch of rules that didn't come from God.The third failure is that the movie portrays entrance into heaven as the result of a magical incantation.  If you just *say* I love God then, BAM, you're in!  Now, certainly the Church itself often presents this fallacy, so it is no surprise to find it in a film such as this.  But nevertheless, it is a gross misunderstanding.There are other theological problems with the film script.  All the supposed Christian characters are attached to what is clearly a pseudo-Christian cult -- complete with a divine oracle who utters prophecies that contradict Scripture.  None of the Christian characters have any problems (except for Rogers, who obviously needs psychological counseling as well as spiritual healing).  All of the Christian characters exude an other-worldly serenity -- except perhaps Rogers' boss.  And the pearl dream thing is just plain bizarre OK, maybe having missed the first part of the movie hurt me on that count...but I doubt it.But at the same time, the film's writer(s) clearly know a lot of the terminology of Christianity, and even have some insights into some of the perplexing issues that arise in Christian theology.  This, I suspect, is what makes the film disturbing to many people.Dramatically, I think the film has moments that work and others that fail (sometimes fairly pathetically).  Perhaps the split between those who think the film is good and those who think it sucks arises from how high each viewer's tolerance is for the theatrical willing suspension of disbelief. Personally, I found that I could accept (on a dramatic basis) all but the most feeble scenes.  I found the music rather monotonous, but that is a minor gripe.In conclusion, I think the film can be valuable in that it does raise some important issues and can therefore be the basis of significant discussions. However, if you're not a Christian, this film is surely not going to help you get an accurate grasp of Christian beliefs!

A thought-provoking presentation of a controversial issue is one that gives a fair presentation of both sides. This film has many characters who are portrayed as born-again Christians. Name one who is presented positively. As with most Hollywood portrayals of Christians, they are all either creepy weird or homicidal lunatics. (Well, maybe Mary, the daughter, could be considered not insane. But then she isn't in the movie to be one of the Christians she's there to be the victim. Maybe possibly the policeman is supposed to be a positive Christian character, but he's only a Christian for about 3 seconds of the movie. Besides that he's a good, nice, upstanding atheist.) Name one Christian character in this movie who makes you say, Yes, I want to be like him. Or even, If that was what Christians were really like, I could get along with them. In a balanced, thought-provoking movie, there might be an atheist character who is intelligent and noble and makes a good case for atheism, and a Christian character who does the same for Christianity. Or there could be a positive Christian character and a negative Christian character. But all the Christians in this movie are absurd stereotypes of Christianity. They are all what orthodox Christian churches have always been against, not what we are for.Yes, it ends with heaven and hell and the rapture turning out to be real. This does not make it a Christian film. When a horror movie makes the man-eating monster turn out to be real, that does not make it a pro-man-eating monster movie. Indeed, that is exactly what the end of this movie is This is a horror movie. The whole point of the ending is that, What if those crazy Christians really are right? What a nightmare! We would be faced with a choice of eternity in hell or submission to a cruel tyrant.

The idea of rapture in the Christian sense is such nonsense and, I'm sure, responsible for the kinds of demented action of many of the misled Christians we hear about who murder their families, or end up like David Koresh and his people at Waco. If it was the story of a demented, lost woman who's trying to make sense of her life, or trying to find some meaning then that would be great. What it is, though, is some nonsensical Christian rubbish aimed at the naive and shallow thinking. How it got itself made as a regular movie and not just some Christian channel low budget thing is beyond me.

Not being a born again Christian I wasn't coming to this movie as a believer and frankly I can't see it converting anyone.Good performances though from all the actors involved I thought. Just didn't really think the storyline made alot of sense. I hope that real Bible-thumpers don't really believe that this is the way God will act in the final days (whenever those are supposed to be). Personally I doubt there will ever be any final days.I realize that depicting the end of the world is hard enough but when you have a restricted budget it requires a lot more creativity. Some of these special effects work and some of them just don't. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse just didn't cut it for me. LOL. Too cheesy. Good idea to avoid actually showing the riders though. That helped alittle.  That way you don't have to purchase Halloween masks.Didn't really see why Rogers character would be so persuaded by the young boy prophet? I've seen lots of people just like him who spout Old Testament and Revelation quotes. I mean, I could do the same thing and it wouldn't mean I am a prophet. There have been wars and rumors of wars since the dawn of time. Just think how many wars there have been since this film came out? And I suspect long after we are done in Iraq there will be numerous more countries we end up fighting in over one thing or another.Also could have benefitted from a slightly larger cast (especially at the end where Heaven looks to be extremely vacant...where are all the others that have been lifted up in the Rapture? Shouldn't they be mingling all around and heading over towards Heaven?).  And why did that Sheriff's Deputy get spirited up since he never said he had faith?Also where does Jesus enter into this whole concept? He is mentioned early on but by the end he seems to be completely forgotten. Everything seems to revolve around God and her unwillingness to love God blindly. I don't believe that is the way God works so that sort of made the film unbelievable to me.

It started off slow, and had a very powerful ending. This isn't exactly a spoiler, but the ending is seriously messed up, and left the distinct impression that god is a complete a**hole. My perspective as an atheist is probably very different than those of religious people, I'd be very curious how they would react, I'd imagine they wouldn't like the message very much. I'm actually not sure exactly what that message is, and I'm very curious. If you like happy endings, or you're a Christian who doesn't like their beliefs challenged, then you probably won't like this movie, but otherwise, I'd say it's definitely worth watching.

I apparently viewed this film from a somewhat different perspective than many other IMDb voters. I don't know the director's intent, but I felt the film exemplified the drawbacks and pitfalls of extreme positions and/or lifestyles. The central character, vividly portrayed by Mimi Rogers, leads a very loose lifestyle in the initial stages of the film and converts to an overly rigid lifestyle in the latter stages after becoming disenchanted and seemingly depressed with what was transpiring in her life. Viewers can judge for themselves whether one type of extremism is preferable to the other. In my opinion, many types of groups or cults (politically or religiously inspired) capitalize on people searching for a person or group who can dramatically change what they perceive as an unrewarding existence. This film may draw, intense positive or negative, response from people with extreme religious positions. Not placing myself at either end of that spectrum, I was deeply interested in the film but felt that it lost some of its impact and possibly a couple of rating points, over the final half hour of the presentation.Mimi Rogers gives a strong performance in a film in which she is required to shoulder the burden. It's not that the other actors give sub-par performances. It's just that the film is so primarily structured around Mimi's character that she is required to carry the load and does so extremely well. In my opinion, an IMDb rating of between 3 and 8 would seem to fit this religiously provocative drama. I personally gave it a 4 out of 10 and would recommend it for viewers who are not offended by loose sexual lifestyles or exploring intense religious attitudes.

All of a sudden, Mimi Rogers,(Sharon)The Gunman,'04, desires to seek the Pearl and advance to a higher spiritual level in heaven. Sharon decides to become like a Moses or John the Baptist and go to the desert for the Ending of the World. The Holy Trinity, God, Jesus (Son) and Holy Spirit are her main interests and she becomes converted along with a husband and child. When I first started viewing this film, I thought I must have selected a Holy Rollers documentary, but some of the subject matter was too graphic and the ending of this film is very very much what the Devil would appreciate every human being choosing the path that Sharon finally decided to Take !

Sounds exciting but this movie makes the end-times a real snore.Lousy ending, but till then this show is enthralling. Mimi rogers does a great job as the beautiful loony.

The biggest problem is the writing, which in part wants to be an affirmation of faith and also maintains an urban cynicism on the action.

We thought that the whole thing was puzzling and way too profound for a crazy sleepover. However, we liked it a lot, because it made us think, and we didn't even watch out r fourth movie because we got into a heated argument over the nature of religion. Then a month or so later I saw it on the IFC during the day. I didn't like it nearly as much while I was in my right mind. Nobody was acting at all, really, and the little girl was the most irritating little dummy. Also, after Mimi Rogers's character stops having sex with everyone it seems like the movie should end soon but then it trails on for another hour or so. I do like the jail scene where the bars fall down, and I think the horsemen of the apocalypse are cool, and I like the fact that one of my least favourite actresses is stuck in limbo for eternity. However, on the whole, I recommend seeing it after midnight with a bunch of teenage girls, or not seeing it at all.

I went into it thinking it was going to be a thought provoking film about Christianity and the ramifications (or lack thereof) of utter belief, and instead I saw a film where the dialogue feels like it was written by a teenager and the acting felt like a high school play.Mimi Rogers has shown herself to be an excellent actor, as well as Will Patton. But their acting in this film was almost laughable. Was it the fault of the director? And there needs to be no excuse made for David Duchovny, as he has proven to be only good when portraying Fox Mulder. The most excruciating acting though came from the little girl, whose acting was so wooden and annoying, I was happy when she died.I love thought provoking movies about faith, films such as Agnes of God and The Apostle, but this one was just not one of them. Take your $3 and go rent Agnes of God. You'll come away from it filled with awe and wonder, as opposed to nausea.

One must either conclude that the film is utter garbage or that there is some subtle allegory that has evaded one's perhaps inadequate sensibilities. Which view one takes, depends of course on one's evaluation of one's abilities. If one regards oneself as not being a complete imbecile, one is apt to come to the former conclusion.There are however two things for which this film may be watched. The first is Ms. Rogers' acting. Ms. Rogers is a consummate actress, and her performance is very good. One is sorry to see it thus wasted.The other thing is that the naked flesh in the movie, including Ms. Rogers' is, rather nice. The latter may be contrasted with the American filmmaker's tendency of displaying underfed women with minimal charms in the buff. Remember Ms. Paltrow in 'Shakespeare in Love'? Three women are shown partially or completely nude, and they do not disappoint.What the movie is trying to say is difficult to determine. It certainly is not a simple story, told straight. This is primarily because there is not much by way of a story. It fails to make any interesting points about God or faith. Granted, saying something new about the gent upstairs is difficult. This should not however, have prevented the director from trying.

In the ending where Sharon and the Sheriff got to choose whether or not they want to go to Heaven or Hell just by saying they love God is simply not true at all. The only way that anyone can be saved and get to Heaven is to choose to believe in Christ and have faith alone in Him alone (Acts 1631, John 315-18). Unlike the movie portrayed, this is absolutely not a decision that we get to make after we die or the Rapture comes; it is a decision that has to be made while we are still alive and on this earth. What should have happened in the ending if this movie was portraying truth from the Bible is that since Sharon believed in Christ earlier in her life, she should have been allowed to enter in Heaven and the sheriff,who by his own choice, did not believe in Christ, would be the one staying in Hell (called the Lake of Fire in the Bible, which is eternal separation from God). Even if someone chooses to only believe in Christ for one second of their life and then completely changes their mind, chooses to get angry at God and then, chooses never to believe in Christ again for the rest of their life, they are still very much saved and going to Heaven. That is God's grace and the wonderful, just, fair, loving, true God that we really have, Who freely gave all of us the very best Heaven had to offer, His only Son,The Lord Jesus Christ, Who died and completely paid for all the sins of the whole world, not the false god that was portrayed in this movie.
