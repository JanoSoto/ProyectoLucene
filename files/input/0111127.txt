Unfortunately, people are dropping like flies around her! Could this perfect mom be a serial killer? Serial Mom is a ridiculously charming and clever film that never really received the credit it deserved. It is John Waters' best mainstream film, and its tongue-in-cheek portrayal of suburbia, domesticity, the media, and conventional gender roles is delightfully subversive. Kathleen Turner was criminally underrated--this was her best performance to date. The dialogue is hilarious, the murders are wickedly funny, and the overall atmosphere of the film is disturbingly bright and shiny. Co-stars Waters regulars Mink Stole, Ricki Lake, Traci Lords, and features a dynamite cameo by grunge goddesses L7.

While that film took itself way too seriously, Serial Mom manages to get Kalifornia's attempted message across by a far more successful means humor. It is a John Waters film in the purest sense, in that it's entirely IMpure. More edgy than his last movie, Cry-Baby, but not nearly as extreme as Pink Flamingos, Serial Mom is filled to the brim with his trademark over-the-top gross-out humor -- but this time it has a purpose. It tells the simple story of a conservative housewife (played indelibly by Kathleen Turner) who murders whomever is unlucky enough to get on her nerves. While her husband (acclaimed actor Sam Waterston in a different light) and two children (Matthew Lillard and Ricki Lake) begin to suspect her criminal nature, the suburban town's death toll rises as more and more people make the mistake of p***ing her off. Turner's performance does for suburbia what Al Pacino in Scarface did for the mob it wallows in its outlandish excess (Oscar snub, anyone?). The murder scenes themselves are so outrageous (they range from stabbing a man in the back with a poker and removing some anonymous inner organ to lambasting a woman with a pot roast) that the film can't help but NOT be taken seriously, and this is where it makes its point. As Stanley Kubrick did with A Clockwork Orange, Waters rubs our faces in our own inner obsession with violence -- but unlike others who have attempted this feat, he remembers to do more than just condemn his audience. Rather, he exposes us for what we really are -- and shows that he wouldn't have it any other way. While others might have stopped as soon as Turner is caught, Waters keeps the story moving throughout her trial -- which features the most entertaining act of courtroom self-defense since Woody Allen in Bananas. One of her killings involves dropping the stage lights at a concert on the head of her son's friend and then proceeding to set him on fire while the audience applauds her sadism, but Waters doesn't glorify the act during the trial, the prosecutor displays photographs of the burnt corpse, but everyone in the courtroom is distracted by the presence of Suzanne Somers. Critics who have attacked Waters for being gratuitous are mistaken he DOES show the consequences of the corrupt acts he depicts -- but he also reveals the sad truth, which is that no one really cares anymore. Along with taking on our culture's passion for depravity, the film also addresses our OTHER potentially dangerous problem repressed conservative housewives. Having no life outside of the home, Turner is so obsessed with doing the best for her family that she's willing to (permanently) get rid of anyone who gets in the way. Rather than being frightening, her killings are just examples of how soccer-mom perfectionism can go too far. In one scene, a future victim of hers is watching Annie and singing along to Tomorrow while her dog licks her feet now THAT'S frightening.Grade B+ "},{"Title":"A kitschy classic","Date":"19 October 2000","Score":"29 out of 32 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Thriller","Review":" An uproariously witty satire on petty bourgeois American values, John Waters brings his own distinctive madness to the screen by focussing on cardboard cut-out caricatures of pop culture Americana.Turning his outrageous gaze on an archetypally perfect housewife and mother from the Baltimore suburbs in Maryland, supportive to her loving husband and teenage kids and possessing a real tlent for cooking, it appears that she is everything a stable, hard-working business man could want. However, there is a slight catch. She is also a serial killer.Mom's tendency to take bloody revenge on any poor neighbouring housewife who fails to observe her rigid socially acceptable guidelines, like not recycling rubbish or driving too fast, is so barmy you are sure to find it absurdly and darkly funny. Kathleen Turner, alternating between dizzy, unquestioning devotion to her family and clinically cool, yet psychotic anger to offending neighbours, either appears to possess a martyr's yellow halo above her head, denoting divine lightness and freshness, or a focussed smile as she carefully contemplates her next victim.If you are on the lookout for some perfectly vibrant, yet malicious black comedy, subscribe to Serial Mom, one of the most ruthless, patronising skits on good manners and nosey, voyeuristic neighbours ever to hit the screen. If you like Waters' latest irreverent venture into visceral, cutting black humour, then get all his other movies, because they are all even more extreme and grotesque - Pink Flamingos, Hairspray, Cry Baby - all kitschy, underrated classics in their own right.

I've just seen it for the first time as an adult, and it turns out that I'd forgotten just how good this film really is! It's certainly not to everyone's taste, and if you can't handle high camp, you definitely don't want to see this; but if you like your films wild and wicked, Serial Mom is a treat indeed! The film follows a slasher plot line, but it's clear that director John Waters didn't want to merely make a slash flick. The film is a parody of life as a housewife, the media and modern society in general; with a heavy dosage of sick humour and a very unique mean streak running throughout. Serial Mom is the sort of film that puts a smile on your face, and it follows the story of a not quite so normal American mother. While her fellow housewives are cooking dinner and cleaning the house, Beverly R. Sutphin is out dispatching people that have got on hers and her family's nerves in a variety of nasty, yet hilarious, ways. Her kids think it's cool, and her husband is duly worried...Kathleen Turner takes the lead role, and does an excellent job of performing in a serious, yet jokey way; which does the film no end of favours on the parody front. She looks the part, acts the part...and really, I cant think of a better middle-aged actress to take the lead in this film. The support cast, which includes Matthew Lillard and Ricki Lake, is good; but it's the director that's the real star of the show. John Waters has made a name for himself by creating odd and twisted films, and although I haven't seen a great deal of them; Serial Mom is his best as far as I'm concerned. It's one of those films that constantly make you laugh (providing you've got a sick sense of humour), while poking fun at society and offending all the right people all at once! I love originality in movies, and this really is one unique film. The nineties saw the release of lots of obscure social commentaries that were lost under films like Schindler's List and Fight Club, and Serial Mom, along with Francois Ozon's 'Sitcom', is one of the best 'under the radar' films of the decade. It's not a film that everyone will like, but everyone should see it just in case!

I first saw it several years ago on network TV, immediately liked it, but also realized that a fair amount of critical flavor had been bleeped out of the movie due to editing it for television. So just recently I purchased the DVD version, which gave me the opportunity to watch it in all its unedited glory.Kathleen Turner is awesome as mad housewife Beverly Sutphin (where DO they get these names?). I can't think of a modern actress who has such a commanding presence on the screen as Kathleen Turner, and here she uses it to full advantage. I don't know if it's her supreme confidence in the delivery of her lines, or her captivating facial expressions, or just the way she carries herself as a woman not to be trifled with, but somehow she grabs you by the ears and doesn't let go.There is a goodly dose of carnage in the film, including a particularly gory scene where a guy gets skewered in the men's room with a fireplace poker, resulting in his liver being torn out. But in the capable hands of John Waters, plus the presence of Kathleen Turner in the scene, it all just seems so natural, and perfectly hilarious. Here I couldn't help thinking about the great film Harold and Maude (1971), where Bud Cort's character fakes his own suicide various times throughout the film, and by golly, he made suicide actually seem FUNNY! You get the same reaction from Serial Mom, where Beverly Sutphin's murders come across as being somewhat on the level of laugh-inducing college pranks.The cinematography is superb, the co-stars (Sam Waterston, Mink Stole, Ricki Lake, Matthew Lillard, Patricia Hearst, Traci Lords, et al) are spot-on well cast, the pacing is excellent, and the film wraps with a very satisfying denouement. Granted, the film is not for the squeamish, nor for those who are averse to John Waters. But for those who can deal with a whimsical horror film, I would recommend seeing this &#150; and get the DVD version if possible, as the director's commentary by John Waters is worth the rental price. I actually purchased the DVD, as I want this one in my permanent video library. I only wish they would make a sequel. Perhaps, Serial Mom joins the PTA.

Maybe, a little too respectable so that when someone speaks ill of one member of her family, Beverly is ready to kill to defend her family!Only one filmmaker seemed designated to shot this highly entertaining black comedy John Waters, the king of bad taste and extravagance. In Serial Mom, most of the comical situations are structured about the two quoted characteristics. The whole is condensed in one hour and a half. You don't get bored one moment and you honestly laugh in front of all these murders. In Serial Mom, you also recognize Waters' strong taste for bloody, gore and horror movies.

John Waters once again demonstrates his unfailing ability to tap into our fear of the gross and disgusting, and, perversely, help us to face our fears - we may know someone who picks his nose, but Waters gives us an obnoxious woman who lets her dog lick her feet clean after a shopping trip. Maybe your mother caught you jacking off when you were younger, but Waters brings a whole new dimension of toe-curling embarrassment to the scenario in the brilliant sequence where Scotty 'enjoys' (ahem!) a Chesty Morgan video. Waters also throws in close-ups of people eating noisily, a dentist's drill in action, a messy impaling (made hilarious by Kathleen Turner's flawless performance), an ankle-nibbling rat, signed photographs of Charles Manson and Richard Speck, respectable middle-class housewives swearing like construction workers, an all-female rock band called Camel Lips and a Pee-Wee Herman doll - still in the box! All this would mean nothing if the film wasn't incredibly funny, and thankfully, it is. In fact, it's one of the most subversive and inventive comedies ever to come out of a mainstream studio, and you'll be quoting the dialogue for weeks to come. And in case you think it's improper to laugh at serial killers, consider this - how often have you wanted to blow away an irritating gum chewer, a teacher who gave you bad grades, a careless driver, whoever stole your last boy or girlfriend, or pretty much anyone who got on your nerves? Serial Mom is the perfect escape valve for all those negative emotions, and is the perfect film to unwind with at the end of a stressful day.Are those PUSSYwillows?

We all have our bad days.","Date":"2 October 2007","Score":"6 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Thriller","Review":" Black comedy can be a difficult genre to get right, in the cinema as well as in the theatre. We can, I am sure, all think of films which were intended to be gross but hilarious and ended up as simply gross. There are too many examples to list them all, but high on my personal list of offenders in this regard must be The Sweetest Thing, Beautiful Creatures and Drop Dead Gorgeous. On the other hand, when black comedy succeeds, the result can be superb. Two of my favourites are Kubrick's Dr Strangelove and Scorsese's King of Comedy, both of which derive humour from serious subjects (nuclear war and crime) but do so with a brilliant satirical wit.John Waters's Serial Mom is not quite in the same class as those two films, but is one of the better black comedies of recent years. The main character is Beverley Sutphin, a middle-aged, middle-class Middle American housewife. Beverley, happily married to dentist Eugene with two teenage children, Chip and Misty, lives in an affluent, idyllic suburb which looks as though it has been taken from a fifties sit-com. (Like most of Waters's films, this one is set in his home town of Baltimore). There is only one thing which disturbs the peace and tranquillity of the area. Beverley combines her role as a housewife and mother with a part-time career as a serial killer. Her first victim is Paul Stubbins, a teacher who makes some unkind remarks about her son at a PTA meeting, and she progresses to her daughter's unfaithful boyfriend, a couple who are rude about Eugene's dental practice and various people who commit minor social gaffes such as failing to rewind rented video tapes (the film predates the coming of DVD), failing to recycle their garbage, and wearing white shoes after Labor day. (This last is, apparently, regarded as a major fashion crime in America). Eventually she is arrested and put on trial.Waters has the reputation of being a director to whom the notion of good taste is quite alien, and, with a plot like this, Serial Mom could have ended up as nothing more than horribly tasteless garbage. It is, of course, horribly tasteless and not a film to see if you are at all squeamish- Waters does not spare us sight of plenty of blood and gore- but is saved from ending up as garbage by two things. The first is an often very witty script, displaying a refreshingly cynical sense of humour, which includes some great lines such as He killed people, mom- We all have our bad days. and Jesus said nothing to condemn capital punishment as he hung on the cross, did he? (the local priest is preaching a pro-death penalty sermon).The second is Kathleen Turner's manically over-the-top performance as Beverley, alternating between a model of bourgeois domestic virtue and a bloodthirsty maniac, and playing both with equal relish. My favourite parts were the courtroom scene where Beverley conducts her own defence with great brilliance and the scenes where she makes obscene phone calls to her neighbour Dottie, a woman who can be shocked by a phrase as seemingly innocuous as Are those pussy willows? Turner is an actress who has somewhat disappeared from view in recent years, but in the eighties and nineties she was one of Hollywood's best known leading ladies and gave some excellent performances in films like the neo-noir thriller Body Heat and The War of the Roses, another very good black comedy.Like most good black comedies, Serial Mom has some serious points to make. The mores of suburbia have been fair game for satirists ever since the first suburbs were built, and here Waters is sending up the culture of middle-class conformity which all too often attaches to such places. Beverley is far from being the only all-American soccer mom who looks with horrified disfavour on her neighbours' minor deviations from accepted norms; all that distinguishes her from millions of others is the extreme lengths to which she will go to punish such deviations. The satire, however, is not just aimed at Beverley, but also at her victims, some of whom are such obnoxious individuals that it is impossible to have any sympathy for them, despite their horrific fates. There is one grotesque scene where Emma Lou Jensen (she who fails to rewind her videos) sings loudly and tunelessly along to Tomorrow from the musical Annie while allowing her dog to lick her feet all over suggesting she is, to say the least, a somewhat strange person. Stubbins, who suggests that Chip is in need of therapy because of his love of horror films, is the sort of arrogant, self-important teacher who thinks that he is paid not just to teach maths but also to control every aspect of his students' lives, down to their taste in films.Serial Mom may not be the best cinematic satire on suburbia of recent years (that must be Sam Mendes's American Beauty), but it is, for all its lapses of taste, a witty and entertaining black comedy. 8/10 "}{"Title":"We all have our bad days...","Date":"8 August 2000","Score":"12 out of 18 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  I am a hardcore John Waters fan, but this is not my favorite film of his. I can't really think of anything I would want to change about it, however, other than maybe setting it in the 50's or 60's so Van Smith could have worked his costume magic. I personally consider this film and Pecker to be his weakest. However, even my least favorite Waters film beats most movies. If another director, say Robert Zemeckis or someone had directed this, then based on the subject matter, I probably wouldn't have had any interest in seeing it. But hey, any movie containing the credits Written and Directed by John Waters (in this case, the credit is superimposed over an image of a pulverized fly who has just been swatted by the title character...he always picks the best shots for his credit, doesn't he?) well, I'm there, no matter what the premise is. Waters' films often center on 'troubled' but lovable female characters, and this one is no exception. Kathleen Turner does a great job portraying Beverly Sutphin, a June Cleaver-esque, devoted happy homemaker who doesn't even allow gum in her house, but has a short fuse and keeps a secret scrapbook (I wonder if it was from Waters personal collection) of clippings about serial killers.  We don't know how long she's been killing, but the first half of the film follows a week in her life and the various neighbors and acquaintances she dispatches simply because they pi$$ her off. Ever momentarily had an urge to kill someone when they stole a parking spot from you, badmouthed a member of your family, or committed an obvious fashion violation? We don't act on it (well, *I* don't anyway, maybe some of you have and I just don't know about it) but Serial Mom sure does.Again, only Waters could have pulled this movie and subject matter off. If you're a Waters devotee, then you are well aware that criminal behavior, trials, and serial killers are subjects near and dear to his heart-this is a man who is a self-confessed trial groupie.  With any other filmmaker, it could have been boring. Many probably would have been extremely offended by a movie about a lovable serial killer played for laughs (especially those who knew the victim of a violent crime) but the tone of the movie is so light and over-the-top that only people with no sense of humor could think it might condone murder. Who else but Waters could think of a victim being bludgeoned to death  with a  slab of pork chop (because she made the mistake of not rewinding a movie before she returns it to the video store) while watching a videotape of Annie? This is not the funniest Waters movie I've seen, but it has its moments. Among the funniest are the scenes where Beverly torments her neighbor Mink Stole with hilariously obscene phone calls to drive her over the edge. Also very amusing are scenes where Beverly's whitebread manner (oh honey, the only serial I know anything about is Rice Krispies!) contrasts with the horrified stares of her family and neighbors. Turner is best in the moments when she goes from a harmless Donna Reed to Charles Manson within seconds when someone makes the mistake of annoying her- just watch her face. Waters fans should also watch for cameos /small roles by Alan Wendel, Traci Lords, Susan Lowe, Mary Vivian Pearce (I only recognized her from her distinctive voice) and though he doesn't appear in the credits, Waters manages to work in Don Knotts.This is one of the few Waters films that I rent from time to time rather than own, but it's still lots of fun. I'll take one of Waters less memorable films over a teen slasher flick or anything starring Jean-Claude Van Damme any day of the week.

The various strategems she uses to distract witnesses at her trial are delivered with the precision of a knife and she does more acting in the defendant's chair than most actors manage in a typical Hollywood flick today. I gave it a 7 rather than something higher because the action around her is okay but delivered more as a set-up for her various exercises in family values, and the plot itself doesn't seem driven by anything other than her proclivities for a particular problem solving approach.

He's a sort of campy, joyful and irreverent filmmaker. He's not too much of a serious artist -- at least not from what I can tell here -- but he's a heck of an entertainer. He is, well, a master of schlock. He's nowhere near as creative as the Coen brothers and not as uproariously funny as the Farrelly brothers, but we're almost in a state of awe watching the movie, smiling, but wondering if we should be when an overly-sweet, caring mother beats a woman to death with a leg of lamb. Thing is, it never seems bad -- it's not even morally reprehensible the way Waters shows it. It's like when you've just watched a gag in extremely poor taste done pleasantly with such giddy amusement that you just shake your head and say, That is just wrong!Kathleen Turner plays the mother who, underneath her thin veil of perfect mother normalcy, has a latent desire to murder those who offend her sensibilities. Sam Waterston plays her husband, a good-natured dentist who stands by his wife as long as he can. It's an interesting pairing of Sam Waterston and Kathleen Turner, two actors blessed with raspy, gasping voices. Ricki Lake and Matthew Lillard play the two's children. Lake, the daughter in search of a boyfriend, is the first to suspect her mother's dark side and Lillard, the son with a love for classic gore horror movies, is interested when he's told his mother may be a killer.It's sort of like a David Lynch movie, if you were to focus only on the gee whiz part of America and replace all of Lynch's darkness with campy situations, like a punk rock band called Camel Lips.A lot of the dialogue and the satirical jabs were pretty obvious, but I wasn't quite sure whether this was just unsubtle comedy or if the joke was in how obvious some of the stuff was (I made a killing!).The acting by Turner reminded me of Annette Bening's in American Beauty, but demented instead of one-note. All the leads are fine, but the big chuckles come from the supporting players like Mink Stole as poor Dottie Hinkle, the victim of a crank caller. Or Patricia Hearst, as a juror who's not in tune with what Turner sees as a fashion faux pas.I had a big smile plastered on my face for about the first half-hour, which is the best part of the movie, and while the last half-hour loses some steam, it's still a joy to watch Turner and especially Mink Stole. It's not really a criticism, though -- most movies start with a great premise and have trouble resolving it. It's not so much that there's no satisfying resolution, it's that some of the more shocking moments come in the beginning and middle of the film.The best way I can think to describe the movie is that it exists in a realistic place populated by unrealistic characters. It's a satirical, farcical black comedy that, despite its gruesome murders, is perpetually cheery and without a trace of mean-spiritedness. (Any modern movie that still uses wipes for editing...) With no pun intended (well, maybe some), it's a movie definition of queer.I think I'll have to go look for Cry-Baby and Hairspray now. And if I can find it (and be able to stomach it), I probably owe it to myself to see Pink Flamingos, which may help me understand the filth label Waters is often given. This movie isn't filthy or vile; I had a good time and it's a nice break to see a movie as demented as this and not feel as if you were just subjected to watching a director stomp on someone already on the ground.*** "},{"Title":"A Classic","Date":"22 January 2003","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  This movie is one of the best black comedies of all time.

There's also that dark side of the norm that the Cleavers and Ozzie and Harriet didn't show, and its depicted in this 1994 John Waters film.Beverly Sutphin (Kathleen Turner) is your typical suburban housewife and mother--she keeps the perfect home, recycles, cooks the perfect meatloaf,loves her dentist husband Eugene(Sam Waterston), loves birds, and keeps tabs on her two teenage kids, daughter Misty (Waters mainstay/veteran Ricki Lake) and son Chip (Matthew Lillard, in his breakthrough role).  Did I mention she was also a crazy and vengeful woman hellbent on serial killers and killing for vengeful purposes?  That's right, she's a serial kiler.Beverly will do anything for her family, even if it means murdering someone.  When someone rubs her the wrong way, she immediately plots revenge on them by killing them.  Even if its for the smallest infraction to her, it often results in the brutal slaying of someone who was just brutally honest.  There's her son Chip's math teacher, Mr. Stubbins, who says that Chip needs more focus due to his high interest in horror and gore films (Chip's the assistant manager of a video store), Misty's ex-boyfriend Carl, who stood her up, Betty and Ralph Sterner, for no apparent reason, Scotty, (Chip's friend) who just aggravated Beverly, Lu-Ann Hodges, who forgot to rewind the video tape, and Juror #8, who wore white shoes after Labor Day.(sorry, this may be a spoiler!), not to mention the obscene prank calls to neighbor Dottie Hinkle (they were so bad, I won't even say them here!).Ok, this is just a strange movie, and when I first saw it two summers ago, I was shocked by it.  Not only was it outrageously rediculous, it was almost sickening what this woman would do for revenge.  I watched it again last night with my brother (who happens to LOVE this movie) and my best friend (who had never seen it), but for some reason, I was enjoying it (scary thought on my part, since I thought Hairspray was strange, and Crybaby was almost unwatchable).  Kathleen Turner puts on an almost memorable performance for this role (I'm wondering how many cartons of Camel cigarettes she smoked prior to making this film, because her voice is SO HUSKY now!) as the murderous mother.  How old were Misty and Chip supposed to be?  I knew that Lake and Lillard were both 24 at the time this movie was released, but was Chip only supposed to be in high school?  Matthew Lillard certainly looked young enough to be in high school, and we noticed it.  What a stretch for Sam Waterston, playing this gullible husband.  How much did they pay him to do this, coming from an actor on Law and Order?!  Whoah, that's guts.My favorite scenes from this movie are The prank call scene between Beverly and Dottie, the Ted Bundy Tape (oh my god, I cracked up watching this!), the part where Beverly kills Lu-Ann Hodges to the tune of Tomorrow from Annie (we were crying during this part, it was so funny), the video store scene where Hodges brings in the video without rewinding it, and Chip informs her of the $1 charge for not rewinding, and when he asks her why, she informs him I didn't FEEL like rewinding!  My brother particularly enjoyed this line, because he works in a video store (and they don't charge for not rewinding!), and the serial mom scenes, when Beverly acts out her revenge.  I LOVED Matthew Lillard in this film (he is so funny and talented, and this was a great start for him, as he has made some memorable performances!)This was an unusual movie, and may be too strange for those who don't appreciate campy farce.  John Waters has done it again, in typical John Waters fashion, and for some reason, this film works. I couldn't begin to tell you how it works, but it does.  This may take two watchings to actually enjoy it, but its not bad, just strange.  This acting is decent, and this film is a real scream at times.  I recommend this film to any John Waters fan, as it is one of his own creations.  Don't do anything to make Beverly Sutphin mad, you'll pay for it later!

If you don't recycle, chew bubble gum,or refuse to rewind your video tapes you could be on Serial Mom's chopping list. Also if you have anything negative to say about her family, your days are numbered. Compared to Pink Flamingos this is much more mainstream. However, Serial Mom is still campy and outrageous and John Waters fans of his earlier work can still dig this as his style is distinct and has'nt changed much. There are HG Lewis and Bloodfeast references thrown about all over the place. Beverly Sutphin's son Chip is a horror movie freak that has a job at the local video store. Her daughter, Misty is played by Rikki Lake and she loves to flirt with the boys. Kathleen Turner's performance as the wholesome, some times deadly, but always shaggable Serial Mom is perfect.

This is a messed up film, but that doesn't stop from being a little funny, kind of creepy, and just a fun film in general.John Waters's film is about a middle-class, suburban housewife who seems content with her family, friends, and neighbors. But those who begin to disrespect her and her family, she brings out her secret identity and begins to terrorize them.The acting is quite good especially by Kathleen Turner. Many actresses would not have taken this role, but Turner did. She brought a new name to the word bipolar. One moment she has a sweet aura, the next moment she's a homicidal maniac. Turner was very brave in tackling a role like this.Overall, this is a pretty funny film that spoofs the law and order. The court scene in the end is a prime example of that. Some people may find this film sick, while others may find it funny. I thought it was pretty funny despite the gruesome murders. But I find it a good spoof of the American life and I loved how accurate Waters got all these details. I rate this film 8/10.

And if murder is the method in which she either corrects these behaviors (or simply eliminates them altogether), that's just too bad, because like fellow John Waters heroine Edna Turnblad (Hairspray), her diet pill is wearing off, and like Francine Fishpaw of Polyester, she just can't take any more heartbreak! Imagine if Divine had lived long enough to do this movie. The obese drag queen would have added a grotesque image to the character of Beverly Sutphin, suburban Baltimore wife and mother who doesn't allow her children to use the brown word, has a police officer remove the gum he's chewing, and treats her hard-working garbage men to mini-bottles as she comments on neighbor Mary Catlett's refusal to recycle. Then, there's the Annie watching video store customer of her son's who refuses to rewind (taken care of deliciously to the song Tomorrow, much like the art patron bludgeoned in A Clockwork Orange to Singin' in the Rain), the math teacher who considers her son a wastrel, and the patient of her dentist husband who upsets her even more as she plots his and his wife's demise by eating cute Cornish hens.Taking care of all of these ne'er-do-wells (in her mind) is Kathleen Turner at her most beautiful, her husky voice perfectly suited to an obscene phone call to obnoxious neighbor Mink Stole, and deliciously rubbing it in later on in an extremely funny court scene where she wins over one witness by doing a Basic Instinct Sharon Stone impression for him. She also gets to visit a men's bathroom in a hysterically gross sequence where she takes care of daughter Rikki Lake's boyfriend who has dumped her for none other than Tracy Lords.Sound like another visit to Stepford? This is one woman who hasn't been robotized for her man (Sam Waterston), even though she goes out of her way to please him much to her children's discomfort. Turner rocks in this film, and while it definitely continues her camp quotient, it also as a quote quotient of hysterically funny memorable lines that have ended up as sketches in various drag shows across the country. John Waters adds just enough bad taste to keep the film amusing throughout, and you will not soon forget it. In fact, you may find yourself watching the film over just as soon as you've finished it to make sure you didn't miss anything the first time!

Kathleen Turner shines in one of her best roles as Beverly Sutphin, a beaming suburban mom with a loyal dentist husband (Sam Waterston), a lonely daughter (Ricki Lake), and a horror genre obsessed son (Matthew Lillard, warming up for his not dissimilar role in Scream). The trouble is, Beverly is easily annoyed, and any person who offends her sets of values or threatens the sanctity of her family will find their time to be extremely short. Eventually, she's caught, and her trial is turned into something of a circus, with tie in products being peddled such as a book adaptation and T-shirts. The portrayal of the way that killers can become a part of the popular culture is really spot on. Serial Mom goes so far as to make a point of the inevitable made for TV version of the events, with Suzanne Somers, doing a cameo as herself, tapped to play Beverly and hanging around as the trial unfolds. The delightful tongue in cheek approach shows how people start rallying around Serial Mom and find the actions of those she hates - such as not recycling - much more heinous than anything she does. Waters's wicked sense of humour is just great, especially when he has a victim bludgeoned with a leg of lamb while the song Tomorrow from the 1982 film version of Annnie serves as accompaniment. Waters has fun with his methods of murder, not taking them too seriously and not having any two alike; as a result, there's not much in the way of gore. (Although there is one priceless darkly comedic gag when it comes to the heart of one victim.) Waters maintains a likably self referential approach, and clips from movies such as The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Blood Feast, and Double Agent 73 show on screen, making this movie a treat to watch for cult film fans. The acting is enjoyable, from Waters regulars such as Mink Stole, Patricia Hearst, and Traci Lords, with Patricia Dunnock a delight as Lillard's gal pal. The movie has good energy, maintaining a nice off the wall sensibility from start to finish. It's just too hard to resist. Eight out of 10.

This wonderfully subversive black comedy depicts an apparently PTA mom who begins swapping flies and then graduates to cold-blooded murder. As Beverly Sutphin, Turner kills anybody who offends her dentist husband, gorehound movie buff son, and her hopeless romantic daughter. Nevertheless, Bev is pretty far gone before the spree unspools. The police are canvassing the neighborhood for an obscene caller initially when they poke their inquisitive noses in at Beverly's house. Waters ridicules everything from gory exploitation movies to culinary habits. Nobody escapes notice in this outrageous laugh riot except perhaps gay people. Beverly racks up seven murders to her credit, killing her victims with everything from a knife to a leg of lamb to a toppled air conditioner. Interestingly, Beverly's last victim is none other than Patty Hearst. Throughout it all, Turner similes and slays. Ultimately, of course, our leading lady is charged with murder and lands in court where she dismisses her attorney and conducts her defense. Serial Mom is such a bright, shiny, polished epic that it is difficult to believe that it is so bloodthirsty. Mind you, the language gets rather profane at times. Lots of pop culture references spring up, ranging from Suzanne Somers to Bill Cosby movies. Despite all the carefree blood and gore, the most agonizing scene occurs when we are forced to watch a couple as they gnaw on fried chicken. One of the most taboo scenes takes place when a concupiscent teen masturbates to the Chesty Morgan soft-porn spy movie Deadly Weapons. Chesty is determined to kill the dastards who killed her man so she smothers them with her ponderous breasts.

For some reason-- which is, fortunately, never explained--, she takes everything too personally, murdering people all around for futile things they have done or said. Actually, Turner's character can NEVER be vexed, or the capital sin appears in the way. In the first scenes, Serial Mom strongly reminded me of 1990's Edward Scissorhands, maybe due to the very American neighborhood both movies have designed. The most funny aspect of this movie is how everybody reacts when they find out Beverly is the lunatic; instead of getting scared, her relatives just try to help her out. In real life, obviously, people wouldn't react that way, and that's makes this a hardly black humor of a picture. The coolest scene to me, moreover, is the rock show; the band playing on stage is sooo junkie that they don't even notice what's going on in the crowd.

Evidence mounts that Beverly is the caller of obscene telephone calls to neighbour Dottie Hinkle, and the murders of several people in their neighbourhood who have crossed their family in some form or another. Beverly laughs off such suggestions, but even her family members end up believing she is guilty of all the murders, with possibly more to come. Those accusations end up being not an issue to most in the Sutphin family, who use their fifteen minutes of fame to their advantage. Even Beverly believes that she can clear herself of all charges despite the overwhelming evidence against her..........When John Waters wants to shock, he gives us Pink Flamingos. Now while this movie tries to go down the route of shock and bad taste, a lot of the performances feel forced, forced to be self-deprecating, forced to be tasteless, forced to be shocking, and forced to be be a parody of the fifties stereo-typical house wife.Yes, I'm talking about the titular character, and the way Turner portrays her, or doesn't as it appears in this movie.It sounds like a double negative, but it looks like she's forcing herself to be restrained in her role, whereas the film would have benefited her from being plain bonkers, rather than squint her eyes every time she gets miffed, and then then do the old breathe out and smile trick.The first ten minutes shows her more maniacal side, especially when she is making the crank phone calls, but the rest of the film sadly falls flat, and no amount of Waters trademark humour can resurgence the boredom.Not a bad film, Turner aside the performances are fantastic, but when the titular character is the boring one in the film, you couldn't care less about the rest.

While it is very much her movie she is ably supported by Sam Waterston, Ricki Lake, Matthew Lillard and Patricia Dunnock amongst others. The violence isn't too gory; in fact the way it is portrayed is fairly funny in a bad taste sort of way!

The horror/comedy about a sweet housewife that's a combination of June Cleaver and Donna Stone. But she may be suspected of fowl play. The police show up at the Sutphin house one morning to show a note (that contained...language) that was sent to Dottie Hinkle, who also get's obscene phone calls. Unbeknownst to everyone, it was Beverly who sent those notes and made the phone calls and all because one day, just as Beverly had found a parking space, Dottie took it first.                        That day, Beverly went to a meeting with Mr. Stubbins, son Chip's math teacher. Stubbins inadvertantly insulted Chip and Beverly got even with him by running him down with the car. Police detectives Pike and Gracey are certain Beverly was involved but husband Eugene says otherwise. The next day, while Eugene (a dentist) was called away on an emergency call, Beverly discovers that her daughter Misty's boyfriend stood her up. She gives him his just-desserts at the flea market but shoving a fire poker through his gut. But the mayhem didn't stop there. Beverly went after the Sterners, Ralph and Betty, because Ralph was the one that called Eugene away on the emergency call. She took them both out.                       Eugene, Chip and Misty began to suspect Beverly as the killer. Chip has a job at the video store and when a customer, Ms. Jenkins, is incredibly rude to him, Beverly hunts her down and beats her to death with...Would you believe a leg of lamb? It was. She was soon arrested and during her trial, she was quite convincing in her speech on how she was innocent. She got everybody to believe her, and was found not guilty.

Thankfully, both talents are used exquisitely and we get a pleasant turnout from one of the most daring and provocative filmmakers of our time. Using words like exaggerated and unrealistic to bash Serial Mom is like criticizing water for being colorless. It's supposed to be like that, and I don't think that registers with a lot of people.This is a difficult film for the public to swallow, but not for fans of Waters. He knows how to create a film from the ground up, and choose specific films that don't have blueprints to their name. He can make an original story, the problem just stems from marketing and MPAA agreement. He's lucky to be understood since his first film, or else, he'd be living the Babs Johnson lifestyle.The story revolves around Beverly Sutphin (Turner) a mom living with her husband and her son and daughter. The family resembles something of a Hallmark commercial, or even an ad for burgers or Sunny Delight. Everything is colorful, vibrant, and dripping with satire. Beverly is hiding that she is really a serial killer, hellbent on giving comeuppance to anyone who annoys her in the slightest way. Whether it be her kids' (Lake and Lillard) teachers, a short fused customer, or Mink Stole playing the perfect nervous neighbor, Beverly will find a way to get even with them.Serial Mom doesn't take itself seriously, and knows exactly what it is; a silly satire built on top of cutesy characters who couldn't possibly do anything wrong. The family is almost perfect, with the exception of Sam Waterson as Beverly's husband who seems he was never let in on the joke of this being a satire. Mink Stole, like stated before, is wonderful and wickedly vulgar much like her performance in Waters' trash film Pink Flamingos.This could also be established as Waters' second stab at the mainstream market with the first being Cry Baby. This is when Waters started to loosen his grip on the trash element of his films and focused on making more appealing films, but still incorporating his unique spin on things. If anything, I commend him for changing his style (we can't all stay hooked on perversions and sick characters to make films can we?)I recently watched and reviewed Waters' tour titled This Filthy World where Waters went film by film discussing the fun and hard times he encountered which each one. When talking about Serial Mom he concluded it was a movie about how much fun it would be to kill people and get away it. Serial Mom understands that statement impeccably because we've all had that sick, sadistic desire to just kill someone who is just aggravating us or simply doesn't know what they're doing. Haven't we? Or am I just a sadist? Starring Kathleen Turner, Sam Waterston, Ricki Lake, Matthew Lillard, and Mink Stole. Directed by John Waters.

She's perfect she's the Brie Van Der Kamp of the 90s. And one might think, that she takes her parental duties a little bit too seriously. Is she? The basic core of the movie is for a viewer to confess didn't you ever want to kill your neighbor? Of course, one might say, but I'd never do it. Didn't you ever want to kill that bitch from across the street? She's never been nice. Of course, but I'd never do it. The victims of Beverly Suthpin aren't nice people they're fake, they're nasty, they're everything that's wrong with the world. In some people's eyes, they should be eliminated. And that's where the true genius of the movie emerges the silly comedy has an actual moral discussion going on under the layers of ridiculous rage and gore. Waters is a genius he knows exactly how to play with all of the ingredients of his movies. He places words in right situations as it was a breeze; he puts some black humor when it gets too serious and just a little bit of scare and creepiness when it gets too kitschy. He's always one step ahead of the viewer he knows his stuff. Or maybe he doesn't care and just goes with his guts?

All this serenity carries over into the opening of the movie, where the Sutphins are sitting down to breakfast. There's some ribbing, but nothing not seen in any family setting from a 50s sitcom. In fact, it was clearly the families out of 50s sitcoms that inspired this family. Dad's a doctor, Mom's a housewife with perfect hair at 700 in the morning, and the kids are good-natured and lovable. They have some issues, but perhaps nothing that wouldn't normally have been solved in under 30 minutes.So we have all this peace, when Beverly (played to perky perfection by Kathleen Turner in the last good role she's had to date) kills a fly with a flyswatter. Now, it creates a moment of tension, but this is still pretty standard fare. The calm that was created initially is only broken when 2 detectives come to the door. They have a note written to a neighbor with cut-out magazine and newspaper letters (like a ransom note) that they caution sweet Mrs. Sutphin contains language. It does indeed, and the note is the first big laugh in the movie. Mrs. Sutphin is shocked, of course; she's the perfect sitcom mother. But later on, she calls the person to whom the note was sent (played by Mink Stole, who has appeared hilariously in other John Waters movies but has never been better than here) and threatens her, using the same offensive word as in the note (among others). She is also a typical sitcom stereotype, as are most of the characters in the movie. The thing that's so impressive about this is how, as the movie escalates, Beverly rarely loses that perfect sitcom mother cool, even as she's killing people for eating the wrong things (her husband is a dentist), not wearing their seatbelts, and not rewinding movies. In another hilarious scene, Beverly is at an L7 concert where she just killed another character. Shortly after doing it, she sees her son and his friend in the crowd. She smiles, waves at them, and puts her hands over her ears and scrunches her face in a comically mock expression, as if to say It's too loud in here! Perfectly cool and natural. That's the genius of this movie. The cast is perfect, ironic in much the same way as the cast of The Brady Bunch Movie was. A lot of regulars return, including the aforementioned Stole, Patti Hearst (yes, THE Patti Hearst), Traci Lords, and Ricki Lake (who was always at her best in John Waters movies). Sam Waterston plays Dr. Sutphin, Beverly's exasperated husband, and he is perfect in the role, trying to keep his cool even as he's terrified of his wife and what he has recently discovered she's capable of. Suzanne Somers has a funny cameo as herself.Serial Mom is one of the most twisted comedies to come out in the 90s. Ironically, I think it's also John Waters' most mainstream movie, even given the material, which suggests he should make more movies like this.

Beverly uses murder like other housewives use cleaners, to get rid of life's little nuisances. She overreacts. Metaphorically, she uses a bulldozer to kill a gnat. She resents people who do not recycle their garbage, and she takes a dim view of drivers who do not wear seat belts, among other things. In an early scene, she announces to police officers who arrive at her spotless home I'm sorry, but we don't allow gum in this house.Despite the promising script concept, the film's main problem is that most, though not all, of the humor falls flat. Since Beverly has some psychological issues, we feel sorry for her. It is therefore hard for us to laugh at someone like that. Still, the plot does have its moments, like when Beverly dutifully puts on her seat belt as she gets into a stolen van to chase down a guy for not wearing his seat belt.The film's plot takes place over a two to three day period, during which the weekday and time are displayed on the screen, to give the plot a diary feel. Then, the plot jumps forward several months to a courtroom sequence. Here, the judicial system and the media coverage of famous criminals are heavily lampooned.Color cinematography is conventional, except for the use of split-screens in the first half. Kathleen Turner makes a great serial mom. Production values are credible. I did not care for all the gore; but I guess it is to be expected, given that this is a John Waters film.Serial Mom is worth a one-time viewing, mostly for the terrific story concept. And the film does have its moments of humor. It's mostly a dark comedy, a fictional satire on contemporary American culture, which unfortunately rewards outlaws who find ways to become famous.

It tells the moving and inspiring story of a suburban Baltimore housewife called Beverly (played by Kathleen Turner). The film stands up very well almost as an analogy for what it is like to be a brave woman in the French resistance. Like women looking to liberate their homeland, Beverly bravely decides to stand up and take matters into her own hands against what she would no doubt see as her own equivalent of rampant Nazism around her. Be the Nazis in this case schoolteachers or people who steal parking spaces, forget to floss, refuse to rewind video store tapes or insist on wearing white after labor day (a sin I'm sure Hilter himself was probably guilty of!), Beverly is always ready to put on her brave face and become a proud one woman resistance movement with a variety of lethal weapons at her disposal (she even gets help from the brilliant girl rock band L7 for a particularly fiery version of justice). This is a brave and inspiring part of this fine film, but the story gets more harrowing for it's third act, when Beverly gets captured by fascist authorities and put on trial. I don't want to spoil the end of the film for those who have not seen it, but this is far from the end of Beverly's courage and ingenuity in the face of her enemies and the way she defends herself in the courtroom is a inspiration to us all. This is a very beautiful and well crafted drama and I hope that one day John Waters will return to the same kind of story and set it in Nazi occupied France this time. C'est magnifique! Everyone should see this stirring and beautiful movie about how to stand up for what you believe.

It's the serenity of suburban Baltimore, the setting of the story, that gives the non-Waters fan a comforting frame of reference.John Waters' movies changed the course of cinema and of gay life. To say I'm a fan is putting it mildly. While a lot of hardcore Waters fans may not care for this movie because it's more conventional, I like it a lot just for that reason.My favorite scene in this movie is one that points up every facet of Waters' take on modern life and demonstrates his masterful direction. It's set in a strip mall parking lot, after Dottie Hinkle has just beat out Beverly Sutphin for a parking place. It's the incident that starts Beverly on her quest for revenge on Hinkle. Just observe the shot of Dottie (played exactly right by Mink Stole) as she gets out of her car. As she straightens her poncho we can see the sign for a JoAnne Fabrics store in the background. It's absolute perfection.Don't miss this movie!

But she has a very dark side, when anyone offends what she considers proper behavior. The first incident we see is her talking very dirty to a neighbor, and we don't know why. But we see a mental flashback and realize it is because that lady had stolen a supermarket parking spot that Beverly was about to take.But that is very mild compared to the later incidents. Things as simple as failing to rewind a VCR tape brought back to the rental store, or a person failing to wear seat belts, or a teacher saying something negative about one of her children, all reasons in Beverly's twisted mind to kill them. The final scene plays out in the courtroom, where Beverly chooses to act as her own attorney, and in a mock trial for the movie wins a 'not guilty' verdict. Overall a waste of time.Sam Waterston is her husband Eugene Sutphin, Ricki Lake is her daughter Misty , Matthew Lillard is her son Chip, and Justin Whalin is a friend, Scotty Barnhill, who doesn't wear seatbelts.

The actress definitely has a cool, casual demeanor (as written), but there are no fanciful notes in her throaty voice, and no natural sparkle of dementia in her manner. Waters enjoys tickling his audiences by putting otherwise-serious actors in incredibly gaudy situations and encouraging them to go for broke, and Turner was apparently enticed enough to tear into the project with relish. Unfortunately, though her approach to the part was probably what Waters wanted, she's too clear-eyed and focused for the pulpy material. One can sense Turner trying to find a comfortable niche here, trying to be wicked and silly, but it's mismatch of whacked-out visual humor (stunt humor that probably doesn't go far enough) and a star who weighs heavy on the punchlines like an anchor. ** from **** "},{"Title":"Dark Humor, Yes, But......","Date":"18 April 2006","Score":"12 out of 25 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Thriller","Review":" Is warped a good word to describe this film?

Serial Mom is perhaps smart and engaging for about five minutes its opening of a perfect family in a perfect American urban neighbourhood is enough to make any far right capitalist gush in delight at the world he wants to think he's helped create in fact the only thing that was missing is a white picket fence but perhaps Walters went against the inclusion after Lynch's Blue Velvet, from several years earlier, had already included it. This opening and the way it was shot, scripted and acted had me thinking that it was taking a huge swipe at the 'perfect world' environment &#150; soon did I realise to my absolute horror that it was actually sort of serious since these conventions stuck for the rest of the film.I suppose the comparisons to American Psycho should run thick and fast when talking about Serial Mom; the book had been written but the film was half a dozen years away from release and Serial Mom sort of resembles the whole 'psycho in a perfect environment'. Both Beverly Sutphin (Turner) and Patrick Bateman have high standards, expect everyone else to conform by them, live in perfect surroundings (the home and the office, respectively) and hide their mask of insanity amongst all the daily things they get up to &#150; what else they have in common is that if someone steps out of line just a tad, they end up as sausage meat. The major difference between American Psycho and this dross is that American Psycho is believable. I think someone could go mad and become a 'Bateman' in the world they live but do I think a housewife with a husband, two kids, a car and big house would crack? No, I do not. American Psycho was also a brilliant take on getting 'one up' on friends and how Capitalist professionals live their working lives, go out and party and basically give their money back to the state through clubs, restaurants and gyms (the more expensive the better). Serial Mom is just a housewife gone nuts &#150; that's it.I know Bateman gets away with a lot of murder but the ending is left open and that's the genius of it &#150; did it really happen? In Serial Mom; Sutphin commits some shockingly obvious murders in some very public places a MALE toilet, a courthouse, someone else's home yet she gets off the hook by.........slightly spreading her legs? It's ridiculous. Serial Mom is a brainless exercise in comedy that doesn't exist, scenes that are more groan out loud than laugh out loud (a masturbation scene) and violence that is not only needlessly over the top but also corny and unoriginal she uses things like a knife, some scissors and a fire poker and doesn't have to worry about fingerprints or anything. Bateman, since he's in the privacy of his own apartment uses nail-guns and chainsaws once his lust for blood gets to a certain point but of course he starts out with knifes and axes as he gets into the 'spirit' of serial killing &#150; there is thought and a hierarchy behind it whereas in Serial Mom, Sutphin grabs whatever item is nearest and does the job &#150; no thought, no real 'feeling' that this is could be real or is planned out.I also found the Ted Bundy references ironic. It has been said that Patrick Bateman was modelled on Ted Bundy and here, Sutphin has received tapes from Bundy, models her spree like he did (perfect world with person gone nuts) and hell, she even defends herself in court like Bundy did. But Serial Mom suffers in overall production value since it's sort of ugly to look at, the logic completely goes out the window nearer the end when Scotty is being chased by Sutphin yet runs for the safety of a rave instead of a police station! Also, after Sutphin's family burst into Scotty's house as the police do; the Sutphin's don't seem to need to offer an explanation as to why they were there (they thought Betty was going to kill Scotty next); topped off with the fact the film basically re-tells us everything from the opening 90 minutes during the court scenes as the story is re-tracked.

Not because the movie is scary, but I get frightened from time to time when I think how humanity can go so wrong, it is so disturbing that you can't even switch it off. I was praying with all my might that the actors would just stop, look at the cameras and say something along the lines of I can't continue making such a bad movie, sorry John, but it never happened, it continued going, with the terrible acting/story, and quite possibly the worst ending I've seen. Ever.The whole movie seems to be played in fast forward, where people change their mind every 3 seconds and decisions make no sense... Hey everyone, I know we're having dinner, but I'll be right back, going to the store.The whole cast seems to support the Serial Mom as well, killing is OKAY! It made me as a viewer, angry. It could have worked, but the non sense on this movie reaches the limits of everything, it's too cheesy and random at times it's just not enjoyable.The scene in court is just appalling, the arguments the 'mom' presents and how the crowd supported here almost made me want to flip my TV over.Those who really liked this movie, I can only ask that you watch some real black comedy...

Kathleen Turner has no flair for comedy at all, and the rest of the cast isn't entirely successful either.  I hate this movie! "}]
