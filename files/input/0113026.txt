They've juxtaposed and cut great songs, and tried to make a small ensemble effort into a large Hollywood extravaganza.

Even making allowances for the fact that he was 63 when he made the movie, his performance was remarkably lifeless and his singing was unremarkable, even strained at times.  Brad Sullivan as Hucklebee was even worse, flat performing and flat singing.  Joseph McIntyre as The Boy turned in a passable performance, though he didn't really do the role justice.  Jean Louisa Kelley as The Girl was perhaps the brightest spot in the lineup, delivering an adequate if not inspired performance.Jonathon Morris was sadly miscast as El Gallo.  He had the agility and strength needed for such a physical role, but lacked the proper menacing  look needed.  His acting was, if not totally flat, at least rather plastic.  And the one song he needed to really carry -- Try to Remember -- he didn't have the voice for.The staging was the most inspired part of the movie.  Simply filming the minimalistic stage production wouldn't have worked, but the movie's set -- two homes and a carnival set in the prairie -- was sufficiently minimalistic to honor the play's concept while still bending to the requirements of the big screen.  This facilitated devices that helped to  flesh out some of the more ambiguous scenes in the play.The script was unfortunately a Bowdlerized version.  The song substituted for The Rape Ballet was incredibly uninspired and inconsistent.  It was almost as if the writer wanted the substitute to be bad, in retaliation for pulling the original piece.  In addition to The Rape Ballet substitution, several other songs were changed from the original, generally not for the better, and the delightful Plant a Radish was omitted entirely.Perhaps the saddest change of all from the stage play was that the role of The Narrator was essentially omitted, and with it some of the most enchanting poetry in the script.

Some are voraciously against this adaptation, these all seem to be those that are purists of the original stage play. Some are rabidly in love with it, these are primarily families and those that love Joey (sorry, Joe) McIntyre. But the majority, of which I include myself, simply like it.I watched this with an open mind since I love the original play and had to watch it a second time to really see how I felt about it. Some of the modifications are admittedly baffling, such as the rewrite of Metaphor, but by no means really detract that much from the original. If there is one thing you can see from this production it is that Hollywood does not know how to deal with a musical anymore. They all panic about marketability and political correctness which can ruin a great show. That being said, I still really enjoyed this production. The addition of the Carnival allowed for a fanciful feel while still grounding the main characters in reality. The character of El Gallo is allowed more freedom to orchestrate the romance between Louisa and Matt by taking a theatre convention of the omniscient observer and applying it to a film. We in the theatre are used to seeing a character come on and off stage, setting scenes and so forth, yet it is a convention rarely used in film but can be done far more effectively since the character does not have to worry about getting set pieces on and off and can simply be a mystical figure. The performances are wonderful, though Joel Grey is woefully underused. Jean Kelly is fabulous as she always is (Uncle Buck, Mr. Holland's Opus). Joe McIntyre is not the greatest actor but his lack of skill adds to the awkwardness of Matt that is revealed once reality sets in. Jonathon Morris is a fabulous El Gallo, much more charming and witty than some of the salesman-like El Gallo's I have seen. All in all the things that differ from the original play do not detract from the film itself. All they do is differ from the play. Would that this filmed production were done on stage it would be a mere shadow of the original stage version, but that is why this is a movie and that is a play.

In this film, that title is the only line from the original song that makes it into the film.  That's because an alternate title of the original song is Rape, the word being defined in the musical as abduction, not the darker meaning.  That explanation, curiously, remains in the film, but the other lyrics, describing different kinds of rapes are excluded.  The exclusion of those lyrics is not surprising--what seemed only risque in 1960 now seems not only politically incorrect but surprisingly callous and insensitive.  The fact, however, that one song from a 1960 Off-Broadway musical cannot fit into a 1995 movie, doesn't necessary mean the rest of the musical can.Much of what was classic in the past no longer fits into contemporary thought.  Updating, however, cannot necessarily preserve what made it into a classic in the first place, and it is not just It Depends on What You Pay that's been updated.Speaking of the original Fantasticks as a whole, the score is something I fell in love with 34 years ago.  The simplicity of it--scored basically for harp and piano--was a revelation compared to overscored Broadway shows.  It also accentuated the music's occasional harmonic surprises, which seem to look forward to Stephen Sondheim.  More than this, the minimalist staging--no real sets or props--also was very foward-looking, and assisted in making more timeless what might now seem like a very timebound story.  I think the fact the original play has run non-stop for 41 years verifies this.All this is lacking in the film.  Jonathan Tunick's updated orchestrations are good, but they blunt the impact of the score.  In place of a bare bones stage, we now see location shooting and a huge carnival set.  Other songs are abridged, and dialogue omitted.  Maybe this had to be done to adapt the musical into something that didn't seem just a filmed stage event and adapt it for modern audiences, but it isn't really The Fantasticks anymore, and it shows on the screen.  The film comes off hopelessly hokey and contrived.  Worse, it comes off as the very thing I believe I remember Luisa asks God not to make her in the play's introduction to Just Once ordinary.Perhaps this is a film that should never have been attempted.  And perhaps someone will have the foresight to release the 1960's TV version on video soon.

This is a weak and butchered rendition of my favorite musical, but it still retains enough charm and humor to convey the perfection of the original. The excision of three songs is bad enough, but the removal of a verse of one song (I Can See It) and the replacement of a verse of another (Metaphor) is downright bizarre; in Metaphor, the entire rest of the song depends upon the rewritten first verse, and so it makes no sense, and in I Can See It, much of the dramatic tension is lost with the missing verse, which they seemed to have cut because they couldn't figure out how to choreograph it. The movie had one really creative idea -- the carnival, and then apparently shot its wad. The Boy and The Girl are wonderful, as is Barnard Hughes and Teller as The Actor and The Man Who Dies, but Joel Grey is surprisingly weak, and Brad Sullivan as the other father is just a total mistake. Much of the material removed is that which suggests that El Gallo is some kind of mystical figure, engineering the whole thing, and this weakens the story considerably.

True, but most of the screenplay versions have become classics in their own right--and for good reason. That reason being that the screenplay itself is an excellent adaptation and it is quality work. Not so with this disappointing movie.This movie had great potential with a good cast. I think that Jean Louisa Kelly was the bright spot, quite good actually, and the actor who portrayed El Gallo was the low spot.Ironically, the movie was like the story. Once Matt and Louisa had the freedom to see each other and empowered to make their relationship and fantasies materialize from abstract to concrete, the magic was gone. I felt the magic of the play was gone because much of what was the magic of our imagination and imagery gave way to too many concrete images on screen via sets, props, and what not. It simply didn't work.I remember the intimacy of doing this play in high school. I was not on stage, but I was one of the pit musicians. We did it in 3/4 in the round. The theater seated 70 people.

I kept saying to myself several times during the viewing, I don't remember this, or I thought something else happened (or was said).No, I'm not going to cut this some slack just because a movie version is going to differ from the staged version.

Personally, had MGM/UA marketed this film properly instead of assuming it would fail and had they not foolishly re-edited it, the film might have fared better. One gripe I have is that the only use of Try To Remember is the reprise at the end of the film. Granted, the excised footage and alternate ending are extras on the DVD but, it would have been nice had the film been restored to the way it was originally intended to be seen and released on DVD.

But even given that, one certainly could have done a better job than this.  I rate this at the bottom of the pile of stage to screen transfers along with the dreadful Bye, Bye, Birdie and Paint Your Wagon.First, why cut Try to Remember (the one song that practically everyone knows) from the beginning of the picture (and trim it at the end).  It establishes the whole mood of the show - calling the audience to remember back when they first fell in love and the magic of that moment.  This show just opens with Bellamy sewing (?)Then, because they wanted to make it more like a traditional movie musical, they cut the narrator - and with him went most of the wonderful dialogue much of it spoken in poetry and verse (note the absence of the speech before Soon Its Gonna RainYou wonder how these things begin...; trimmed down is the Curious Paradox speech the most important part being cut out; gone is Louisa's self-description that sets up Much More as well as Matt's intro to Metaphor; and most important of all the speech opening the second act is gone which explains much of what the story is about).Gone also are all the wonderful metaphors (the whole idea behind the song of the same title)that prevade the show - the gardening metaphors are gone (hence why Plant a Radish was cut, though one wonders why they left in This Plum is Too Ripe); gone also is the metaphor of the wall (one of the most important in the show, leading to the most significant, if not most enigmatic, line in the play Leave the wall, you must always leave the wall.)Not surprisingly the mute is cut, but other characters are changed as well. With the narrator gone, the motive of El Gallo is unclear.  Why is he doing these things?  Why does he say the curious paradox speech if he is not going to explain why he hurt them (and himself)?  Only the part of Henry remains fairly faithful to the original play (even Mortimer is given over to Teller as a non-speaking role).  Louisa is played too simperingly sweet rather than as a self-absorbed teenage girl fascinated more with the idea of being in love than actually loving Matt. Her transition at the end (from I am love originally in Metaphor to You are love at the reprise) makes no sense in this version.Yes, most of the songs are there.  But they are often trimmed down, replaced with safer songs (like the absolutely horrible Abductions replacing the clever It Depends on What you Pay) or the lyrics are completely rewritten(Metaphor). I know the arguments for replacing Depends, but I have directed the show twice and played El Gallo once and have not ever heard a complaint about the song - you simply have to introduce it correctly.One wonders why they even decided to film this show if they were going to change it so much.  I believe a fairly decent film might have been made if they had stayed with what they had.  Instead they decided to go Hollywood with it and the result is nothing like the original story.  No wonder it stayed in the can for 6 years before being released.  It probably should have stayed there.  One big disappointment.

After all, what made the show memorable on stage was the fact that it was so intimate, it just didn't feel right for the screen.

To anyone reading this review if you've seen and enjoyed a stage production of The Fantasticks but haven't seen the movie, don't bother; if you've seen the movie, but never the stage play, do yourself a favor - see the stage play if ever you have the chance, and also buy the original cast album to learn what the music is supposed to sound like.

There's no back story for El Gallo, and no real history of the two fathers and their kids. As originally written, this show would not make a compelling movie - although it's a wonderful live event. So I didn't really mind that they opened it up and created an actual location for the story to take place, in this case the San Rafael Valley of Arizona, apparently sometime in the Depression. The two families live in quaint little houses in the middle of nowhere. Fine so far. And in order to beef up the chamber-style accompaniment of the play, they hired the wonderful Jonathan Tunick to orchestrate it probably the best decision made by the producers.In order to give El Gallo some background, however, the writers introduce an entire traveling circus that for some reason chooses to set up in a neighborhood containing only four people. It's a little creepy, and more than once reminded me of Something Wicked This Way Comes. The casting is the next problem. Hughes and Teller seem right as the players. Joel Grey is good as always, but Brad Sullivan is a dud. (Try to picture Bert Lahr and Sterling Holloway in these roles - they were in the 1964 TV version. Now THAT was a cast.) The young couple is OK - Jean Louisa Kelly is charming, and she was about to make a splash in Mr. Holland's Opus. El Gallo as played by Jonathon Morris, seems to be trying to channel Cary Elwes from Princess Bride and has an unimpressive singing voice. Too bad they couldn't have cast Kevin Kline or someone with a real voice as well as charisma.So it starts with questionable raw material, then falls apart when they begin trimming songs, creating phony new dialog, and even substituting a lifeless new song for the biggest number of the musical. The lackadaisical approach to the original material spoiled the show.If you've never seen The Fantasticks, please go to see it live, even if it's just done by the local high school. Then you will capture the poetry and simplicity that made this a huge hit off-Broadway.

Yes, folks, as of this date The Fantasticks is still playing. There was a short interim when the Sullivan Street Playhouse was torn down to make way for a high rise in 2002.Most of the reviews of the movie are indicative of two views. If one hasn't seen The Fantasticks on stage or heard the original score in its entirety, the movie ain't that bad. However, after more than 50 years running, and after thousands of international and summer stock productions, the play has had a lot of critically biased audience when they view the film. It might have been better if the makers of the movie had just filmed a stage production. The results might have been the least expensive and longest running film ever produced.

For those who don't know, it ran off-Broadway for nearly 42 years and now is back and has been playing for about another four years. The musical has its detractors but I am not one of them. While the show does lose its luster in parts during Act Two, some of the songs in this musical are among the best ever written for musical theater. Other than the wonderful classic, Try to Remember, this show includes the hilarious It Depends on What You Pay and the beautiful and haunting They Were You among others.The movie version has a good cast. The two leads (Kelly and McIntyre) are very good and you also have Joel Grey in the mix, but this version falls flat. The direction and the editing are very bizarre (especially during the father duet Never Say No) and the movie leaves the show's most famous song which opens the musical, the previously mentioned Try to Remember and leaves it for the very end as an afterthought.A lot of the magic is lost in this version and I can see why it was shelved for five years.

Although the DVD includes the edited film they have included these extras as bonus material. The only thing better would be a restored version.The cutting was just senseless. To take out Try to Remember in any way, baffles me. I also thought the fathers characters were trivialized and reduced by taking out Plant a Radish. This was a shame since the movie featured Joel Gray as a father. I didn't much care for the Abduction number. The DVD shows you a filmed version of It Depends on What You Pay, that would have obviously been much better. They also managed to edit out much of the character of El Gallo.

As a newcomer to The Fantasticks I really didn't know what to expect. I'd heard parodies of the songs, and seen and heard allusions to the play, but I'd never seen the actual production itself... until now.I've heard critics pan the stage play production, and based on what I've seen in the film I think I can understand their perspective, but not really agree with it. The merits of the adaptation aside the basic premise of a rogue carny bringing two you hearts together has a certain charm, but I think what the critics want is to understand are the wherefore's of El Gallo's motivation. But the answer to that is obvious; if one thinks about it enough.To the film; I liked it, and I understand why there seems to be a lot of dissatisfaction with this film. Some of it comes from the process of adapting a stage play to the screen, but the other aspect is method. And by that I don't mean style, rather I mean some fundamentals in film making techniques.That aside the film is actually well shot and well acted, and the set design and art direction is some of the best I've ever seen in a film. The fact that it was shot in winter is even all the more amazing, as I was truly captivated by the world presented For myself this film, stylistically, has a lot in common with One From the Heart by Francis Forc Coppola (though Coppola's film deals with a pair of hearts that face a more matured theme dilemma). There's a lot of implied intimacy in terms of style, which help conveys the overall gist of the film's message.The musical numbers, for what they are, are a bit hit-and-miss (song depending). My personal favorite is the Abduction song. A lot of energy when into its performance. That and it's the one number that seems to have an underlying logic to it.Overall I enjoyed it. It's light entertainment. It may not fulfill the wishes and desires of those familiar with the stage production, but it has a cinematic quality that can be appreciated.I'd recommend this film for those who are looking for a more traditional throwback to the Hollywood of yesteryear, but with a modern-production bent. I'm not sure I'd recommend it to all fans of musicals, much less the play, but, if the viewer is patient enough, they may find something to enjoy and savor.A decent watch.

The Fantasticks is the longest running Broadway musical in history. It's not for teenage girls because you'd be hard pressed to find a teenage girl who understands the musical. It's a complex plot about the loss of innocence and how that enriches ones life after the pain subsides. The music cannot be matched and the lyrics are exquisite. The actual movie production didn't work as well as the stage version because it was written for nothing but a platform on a bare stage. That simply doesn't work in a movie.

I think I know the show well enough to say that this movie is a complete disaster.The Fantasticks, as written for the stage, relies on several devices to carry its message.  The entire production is fantastical in that just about everything is realized in the audience's imagination.  Things like the wall between the houses (a pole), El Gallo's tree (just a ladder), the suspension of disbelief of Matt and Louisa as they're manipulated throughout the play.  Every time the movie does one of these things literally it breaks down the magic of The Fantasticks.  Without that intimate magic none of it really makes sense.The movie has a botched script too - every now and then a glimmer of the real show will surface and get the attention of those who know it, but then it falls apart again.  As a result none of the characters really work.  We don't believe in the kids - Matt and Louisa's character development must have ended up on the floor in editing.  The fathers appear to be more clowns than anything.  And El Gallo isn't mysterious or charming enough to woo a preteen in this version.  Worse, this script relies on heavy handed use of editing from one setting to another during several of the songs.  It's okay once or twice, but this movie is all over the place.  In a deleted song, the fathers jump instantaneously to the porch roof for no good reason.  It's really preposterous.As far as the cast goes, all disappoint except Louisa (Jean Louisa Kelly).  She has an excellent speaking voice for the role, and a lovely singing voice.  Several of her soprano lines were cut, alas, but she does a credible job with a lousy, wandering script.  The rest of the main cast appears to be doing a junior class play.  El Gallo in particular appears more angry/anxious/wishing-he-had-a-real-job than the suave/confident/paternal figure he's supposed to be.  He just throws away several of the key lines in the show like he's reading them for the first time.  And if you watch the deleted opening Try to Remember you'll be squirming in your seat has he drives his truck while smiling to the camera (the effects folks held back on the little dazzling star flash on his teeth, fortunately).  Ugh - a real pity.Several other reviewers have offered the advice to see the stage play and forget this movie.  They're right.  Watching this movie will leave you wondering why you wasted your time.

The stage play uses absolutely no scenery, and often we are completely unaware exactly where the story is taking place. It inevitably changes when opened up for the movies and is given specific, brightly colored settings. So the film, like the 1972 film version of Man of La Mancha, will not please everyone.La Mancha received a disastrous reception as a film when it was released, but it did have a fairly decent run in movie theatres. No such luck with this film--M-G-M/UA let it sit on the shelf for FIVE YEARS, and even then released it to only a few theatres, where almost nobody saw it. It is currently making the rounds on cable, and upon seeing it, the cowardice of the studio becomes even more evident,especially when one realizes that the script, with one major exception, is an extremely faithful rendering of the stage work, and that unlike the film of Man of La Mancha, this does use legitimate singers in most of the roles. Apparently, the film was re-edited by Francis Ford Coppola, who proceeded to cut some of the songs, but if the re-edited version is the one currently making the rounds on cable, certainly did not cut as much as is thought (I have seen it onstage). It is true that Try To Remember, the show's one huge hit, is saved for the end of the film, but in the version I saw, it is sung complete, and not cut down.The musical victims are Plant a Radish (which I frankly don't remember), and the now very politically incorrect  It Depends On What You Pay .(the substitute, Abductions is completely inoffensive, but totally unmemorable as a song.) Every other song is included.The acting is pretty much what is required--no Oscar-worthy performances here, but Joel Grey and Brad Sullivan (who, mercifully, does very little singing) are hilarious are the two fathers. Jean Louisa Kelly, who first sang on screen in Mr. Holland's Opus, can act reasonably well, has an excellent singing voice, and has the right kind of sweetness (without ever becoming sticky) for the role. Former New Kid on the Block Joe McIntyre has a fairly decent voice, but he is not the greatest actor around.Jonathon Morris, unlike the original El Gallo-- Jerry Orbach-- has long hair and a British accent, and the right kind of sympathetic, gentle cynicism needed for the role. He does not have a rich, Robert Goulet-like voice, but it is still an attractive baritone, although, for some reason, he chooses to croon Try To Remember rather than sing out as if he were doing The Impossible Dream. Through digital technology, the singing has been done live rather than lip-synched, and as a result does not look stilted.The photography is gorgeous, full of bright colors perfect for a light musical fantasy, and the story is never allowed to become schmaltzy through bad direction.Those who would dismiss this film should give it a chance.

It is logical that at some point a movie version would be made, but the movie version being bad is not unexpected. The musical is strictly a stage play. The actors have to speak to the audience a lot and much of the set is seen in the abstract. Visualizing it and making it into a movie would be an extremely difficult and only good it if was done by a gifted director. RENT managed to do it pretty well, but even that didn't go perfectly. In this case, the director seems strictly average and he couldn't control it. They also took out some the best songs. The worst exclusions by far are taking out Plant a Reddish and truncating Try to Remember. Another one that bothered me was taking out the Rape Ballet, while I realize that the song sounds strange and might be awkward, but adding the horrendous the Adbduction Song is atrocious. They also decides to unnecessarily add new lyrics and take out great ones from songs, which makes the song seem less powerful from Beyond that Road and Metaphor. The one ingenious twist was adding in the carnival and if this were a better movie, it would have worked wonderfully, but it is not handled well. It ends up stilted and doesn't make much sense. It goes past the funny- because-it's-so-fake point and goes straight back to ludicrous and ridiculous. My biggest surprise was. How disappointing Joel Gray was. He is normally great, but his performance is forced is this. His dancing is also disjointed and looks untrained, even though it isn't, but is looks awful. Their El Gallo is my least favorite piece of casting i nthe entire film. It doesn't quite hit my personal ten worst miscast in film history, but it's close. The character has to be mysterious and sexy, but theirs is ugly, exaggerated and doesn't have a very good voice. Mortimer's part is also reduced and his monologue in the play about becoming the man who dies is one of my favorite parts and it is completely cut. The one good thing in this is Jean Louisa Kelly, she has the perfect blend of naiveté and dreaminess is perfect.

It's not that we were brilliant, but Brad Sullivan was so completely god-awful that Joel Grey (who at least is competent) was completely sandbagged. Why in the name of David Merrick would you cast someone in a major musical part who can't carry a tune in a bucket? I lamented that Plant a Radish was cut from the movie until I saw it as a DVD extra. Oh. That's why they cut it. The singing sucks.The young lovers were OK. Jonathon Morris acted wonderfully as El Gallo, danced well... and his singing was OK but breathy. None of the power associated with the role.The best ones in the movie were Barnard Hughes as Henry & Teller as Mortimer... so of course their parts were heavily trimmed, prompting the heading on this review. Apparently when Francis Ford Coppola was editing the movie, he was shocked and aghast at Teller speaking. Teller is now silent in the film.Some of the changes from play to film are clever, and there is some beautiful photography. But in a musical, without the voices you're sunk.

Yes, we all know and love the stage production. Can't you simply enjoy the movie for what it is? Frankly, I thought it captured the mood of the play quite well. It was filmed on the praire of Arizona and has a very nostalgic,theatrical feel to it. El Gallo is not the best, but Louisa and Matt are charming.Especially Louisa. She is beautiful. And it's got Joel Grey, for gosh sake. Anything he's in is worthseeing. So stop complaining. Don't grade on a scale of 1 to stageproduction.  Appreciate the movie for what it is. I know I did.

Even as an adolescent myself, I can't relate to the young lovers torn apart by 'feuding fathers', who are really just pretending to do so, in order to arrange the marriage of their children. It's a cute concept, and it's very lost here. After hearing the original cast recording of this musical, I can understand why some reviewers here have said The Fantasticks was butchered on screen. With just a harp and a piano, there's the sort of nostalgic charm that Try To Remember creates when used as the opening number.  That's lost somewhat in the movie version, which leaves the 'first act' rather lifeless and idiotic; Jean Louisa Kelly is surprisingly bad, Joe McIntyre is totally unlikeable, and I have no love of any of the songs performed.  Even Joel Grey, who I loved in Cabaret, is unenjoyable. After 'This Plum Is Too Ripe', the story picks up somewhat.  There's more of a focus on El Gallo, the very mysterious and very charming carnival master who orchestrates the 'abduction' that brings the lovers together in the first half of the movie.  While he was a welcome spark of life in the boring first half, even he was subdued there as compared to the second part of the story, where he charms Kelly's character and seduces McIntyre into the bright lights of the sideshow in order to teach them both some valuable lessons. You could say that maybe I haven't learned what Louisa learns in the film, about the seductive effect of illusions and where it really leads you, but I can completely understand why she finds El Gallo wonderful, even as the tents of the sideshow are crumpling and lightning is striking at a snap of his fingers.  He's both captivating and cynical, a welcome bit of charm and life, and I would have welcomed the bigger role I've heard he has in the original stage show as the narrator throughout.  I'm surprised there aren't a thousand shrines to this wonderful performance, not to mention a cult of El Gallo fangirls. Only from his 'real' swordfight with McIntyre's character Matt onward did I become interested in this movie, but once I was hooked, it was addictive. The simple but wonderful monologue that begins 'There is a curious paradox...' nearly set me crying; I can't think of a single person who can't relate somehow to those words.  Even with my lack of love for the teenage leads, I enjoyed them finding each other again through my appreciation of that message. But to everyone who wants to see The Fantasticks buy the DVD version; some of the best scenes were cut, as well as The Rape Song, which was one of the few songs I genuinely enjoyed.  All the funniest moments from the beginning were cut, which was probably a large part of why it felt lifeless. And finally, the end of El Gallo's monologue, cut from the movie entirely (including the DVD) and beautiful in itself to make me whisper 'wow' a second time ...I do not know the answer, I only know it's true.  I hurt them for that reason, and myself, a little bit, too.

It is simply terrible for many reasons, chief of which is the musical interpretation and deleted songs. The charm and excellence of the show's music is its pizzazz, its upbeat tempo. In this turgid film version, the music flows like molasses. Each song is performed in seemingly slow motion. The orchestration is also very poor. The theatrical version has a pianist and a harpist (who also plays percussion). In the movie version, there is a small orchestra which cannot come close to matching the vibrant quality of the theatrical version. And, amazing as it may sound, the director, Michael Ritchie (who ought to stay away from anything musical), decided to eliminate three of the show's songs as originally presented. He deletes Try to Remember from the beginning of the show, the awesome Rape Song, and the cute Plant a Radish. What in the world was he thinking about? You can get these songs and performances in the special features of the DVD, but not in the film itself. This is pure madness. The role of El Gallo is poorly cast. The kids, however, are cute and have good voices. But their efforts are lost in this very bad film. Just buy the original cast recording and avoid this film like the plague.

I thought Luisa sang beautifully in that Disney fashion, that Matt was not that good, and I was mesmerized by El Gallo.  The story has a funny premise that intertwines innocence with a haunted surreal quaility.  The fathers' characters were good, but incidental, although I appreciated their first number about 'saying NO to kids'.  The carnival setting and Jonathon Morris conveyed the surreal, while the two kids conveyed the innocence.  I wish I had seen the stage show, if this is viewed as a lesser product. And, I'll be watching for Jonathon Morris in future productions.  I recommend this highly as wholesome family fare and will add it to my collection at some point soon.

After sitting through the usual bombastic trailers I was utterly charmed from the first scene on. The setting, sets, carnival lighting, characters and actors, I loved it all. It's very simple, but with a few twists.  You have to buy into it in the way only exquisitely wounded souls can, and I did.  Not as grand as the Sound of Music, but in the same mold.  Not as dark as Francis Ford Coppola's One From The Heart, but there is a sheathed knife here.  The boy-girl story may be fairly shallow, but the surreal imagery of this film is haunting.  If it's been moderately cut from the original non-released version, I would say some more could and should have been left in.  Not for everyone, but almost.

I attended a pre-release screening, and can happily report that director Michael Ritchie has beautifully accomplished the near impossible feat, translating the simple  heartwarming stage musical into a simply stylized film musical while retaining all of its charm.The show on stage is performed without sets and with a lot of poetic suggestion from the script and imagination from the audience.  On film it is not exactly transported to reality, but would more accurately be described as surrealistic, which fits the musical format perfectly. The film is set in the 1920s, a relatively more innocent time, at least in our memories, and thus makes the innocence and naivete of the young lovers easily palatable. The characters, let by Joel Gray as one of the fathers, live in the middle of a barren desert, their houses situated side by side and separated by a white picket fence.  A mysterious carnival sets up shop nearby, run by magician/illusionist El Gallo, whom the fathers hire to arrange an abduction that will bring their children together.  The story plays itself out pretty much the same as on stage (the original writers were wisely retained), and due to its strange, surrealistic quality it all makes sense in a dream-like way, even when the characters break into song.All but one of the beautiful songs are in the film--the Plant a Radish song is gone, but is not really missed, as it didn't advance the story that much.  The Rape Ballet song from the original version of the show has been changed to a more politically correct similar song that didn't use such an ugly word as rape but serves the same purpose.  (I'm told that several years ago the original song had been replaced by this one in the stage show as well, though I'm not certain. The show has been playing Off-Broadway for 40 years.)  Perhaps the most well-known song from the show, Try to Remember is not sung at the beginning as on stage, but rather at the very end, which is quite fitting for the film as selected clips of the preceding film are intercut like faded memories.  The Metaphor song is cleverly staged at the carnival in front of a silent film of romantic scenes. Soon It's Gonna Rain is sung under a big tree with El Gallo hiding in the branches while sprinkling glittering rain onto the love-struck couple, and performers from the carnival hiding in the bushes providing vocal accompaniment--a skillful melding of the theatrical and cinematic.The vocals of the actors are all superb.  Musical arrangements which where just a piano and harp on stage are now fully orchestrated, but not overdone and work well.  Finally, in keeping with the theatrical spirit of the piece, the cast actually does a curtain call from the carnival stage during the end credits.Theatre purists should not be wary of this film.  Fans of the show should not be disappointed as long as they are not expecting a mere filmed stageplay.  Understandably, it is not really a commercial picture to compete with the special effects action flicks popular with the coveted teen audiences, so it will just have a limited theatrical release in big city art houses.  In fact, the picture was film five years ago but languished on the shelf as a difficult-to-market film.  Thankfully it will finally introduce millions of non-theatregoers to the wonderful story and songs, and will probably do most business on home video among traditional musical lovers. One hopes it will get a DVD release to take advantage of the wonderful score and the ability to search for favorite songs at random.See The Fantasticks.  Especially if you are an adult.  It will remind you of what it was like to be young and innocent.  You will want to revisit that feeling over and over again. As this work reminds us, that innocence is something none of us realize we have until we have lost it.  There's no other way to know it.  Kind of bittersweet, but a paradox of life.

I'd love to know more about why it wasn't released theatrically in 1995 and am curious about the extensive re-editing done for the DVD in 2000.
