Mistakenly wanted for murder by the police and wanted for robbery by a gang of crooks, Hatchett's only hope to clear his name and get out of this mess is a television reporter named James Russell (Sheen).This movie was just a good time.  After seeing Rush Hour with Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan, I wanted to go back and see earlier comedies with Chris Tucker in a starring role.  (I already saw Dead Presidents, The 5th Element and Friday, but they either weren't comedies or he wasn't a starring character.)Again, this movie was a good time.  It doesn't deserve to win any awards, but it's just fun to watch.  The entire cast offers great performances, while it's always good to see Paul Sorvino perform. While Tucker's character isn't exactly the nicest guy, the audience feels bad for him.  The audience is made to feel that he does what he does because he has to.  In his situation, I don't think many people would do otherwise. While he does take things to extremes, the movie wouldn't be as fun if he didn't.I would recommend this movie to any comedy fan, buddy movie fan or fan of the actors.

But as far as I'm concerned, Chris Tucker - who earlier that summer had starred in The Fifth Element - is always funny enough to merit at least some recognition; and anyway, this sort of flick is supposed to be silly. While Charlie Sheen is far less entertaining in his role, Paul Sorvino played such an interesting character that I agreed with one of my friends that he and Chris Tucker should have gotten more scenes together. Truth be told, I'd actually never heard of Vic Damone until I saw this movie.OK, so maybe we could be cynical and say that Chris Tucker just gets the same role in every movie. I still consider him funny, and I wish to assert that Money Talks is good for a few laughs. Worth seeing if only for that.

In his first starring role, Tucker clearly wants to imitate Eddie Murphy. Co-starring Charlie Sheen as a frustrated news reporter, a persuasive supporting cast, featuring Paul Sorvino and Heather Locklear, and crackling direction by Brett Ratner in his debut, Money Talks is nothing but rambunctious fun. The key to Money Talks is whether you find Chris Tucker either entertaining or obnoxious as a whiny-voiced dynamo whose motor-mouth never stops.If you've seen the doper farce Friday or last summer's mega-budget science fiction saga The Fifth Element, you'll recognize Tucker by his bulging cue-ball eyes, pouting bottom lip, and beetle brows. Acting like Buckwheat with a subversive attitude, Tucker's trademark is his helium-pitched, fast-paced delivery with profanity between every other word. He can rattle off a line of dialogue faster than a Federal Express commercial. When Tucker isn't dodging bullets and careening in cars in Money Talks, he is jive-talking and wise-cracking with the kind of brazen effrontery that either makes you laugh harder or aggravates you to no end. The screenplay by Toy Story scribes Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow uses the classic theme of mistaken identity. Franklin is raking in some cool bucks as a scammer who fences stolen property at his car wash. Along comes scoop-hungry television news reporter James Russell (Charlie Sheen of Platoon) who gets Hatchett arrested for soliciting goods. The incredulous Hatchett winds up shackled to an unidentified Belgian crook. Nobody recognizes the infamous Raymond Villard (Gérard Ismaël of Spécial Police). During a routine bus transfer, Villard's henchmen blow up the vehicle and rescue their boss. Franklin survives by virtue of his being cuffed to the evil Villard. Aboard their escape helicopter, Franklin learns about a cache of $15 million in diamonds. Before the villains can kill him, our hero bails out of the chopper and splashes into the ocean. But Franklin is only leaping from one frying pan to another. It seems the L.A.P.D. has accused him of killing the fourteen prisoners and two police guards on the bus. Hatchett contacts Russell because he believes the news reporter might help him. Russell agrees to harbor the fugitive so he can get an exclusive as well as convince his British boss Barclay (David Warner of Titanic) to re-hire him. Even that backfires when Russell finds himself implicated in Franklin's crime.Although the Cohen and Sokolow screenplay adheres to a predictable formula, the story generates enough thrills and chills as well as a neatly planted surprise or two to pass muster. Basically, Money Talks amounts to a chase thriller with all the villains pursuing Franklin. They're prepared to kill Franklin as well as anybody else who gets in their way. Meanwhile, not only must Russell keep Franklin alive, he also must humor the wealthy parents of his bride-to-be Grace Cipriani (Melrose Place's Heather Locklear). Happily, the plot confines both Grace and her catty mom Connie (Veronica Cartwright of Alien) to their mansion. A lesser script would have involved them in a kidnapping plot. Most of the time, the film focuses on Franklin's center camera efforts to negotiate with his various enemies and adversaries. Freshman helmer Ratner supercharges the action with such momentum that it rarely let up on it fast and furious pace. If the second to a winning comedy is maintaining a lively, timely, breakneck clip, Ratner succeeds in spades. Money Talks careens from one plot twist to the next with marvelous abandon. Ratner nimbly directs a genuinely exciting chase scene, an explosive assault-on-the-bus scene, and the gunslinging pyrotechnical finale at the Los Angeles Coliseum where everybody wields a weapon. When he isn't proving his talent helming these second-unit action scenes, Ratner has fun playing Tucker and Sheen off each other.The solid, dependable, square-jawed Sheen makes a convincing straight man for Tucker. He is a news reporter with aspirations to join CBS-TV's 60 Minutes. Sheen's scenes with Tucker crackle with live-wire energy as the two spar with each other. The fierce, pugnacious camaraderie between these guys recalls the feisty relationship between Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte in 48 Hrs, and that's what makes Tucker and Sheen such an offbeat and hilarious pair. Wolfish Gérard Ismaël turns in an appropriately guttural performance that captures the hard-edged notoriety of the Belgian antagonist. The rest of the cast, including Sorvino as Russell's future father-in-law, Veronica Cartwright as the sneering wife, and Locklear as Russell's pretty bride acquit themselves well in peripheral roles. In minor roles, Paul Gleason of Trading Places stands out as a sympathetic but suspicious Lieutenant Bobby Pickett and Michael Wright as one of Franklin's schoolyard chums.Money Talks compares favorably to the old buddy comedies of Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder because it only wants to be a rollicking barrel of monkeys. If Chris Tucker can keep making agile comedies that click like Money Talks, then Eddie Murphy has something to worry about.

Charlie Sheen plays a reporter who is trying to reveal con artist Chris Tucker. Tucker escapes police custody when the transporting bus explodes and several cops are killed. Tucker is blamed and a manhunt begins. Sheen, looking for the ultimate story, uncovers the real story thus landing him in alignment with Tucker. Typical formula with a climax to match although production pays off during the stadium sequence. Story functions around Tucker's wild antics and unnecessary elements such as Sheen's engagement to Heather Locklear. Director Brett Ratner handles the action with decent production. This is more or less a stage for Tucker's antics but he and Sheen collaborate very well. Locklear is never involved in the plot. She is simply a prop for Tucker to make some sort of embarrassing impression upon during a public event. It might have been practical had Sheen's character not been involved with anyone thus sparing viewers a lame subplot. Paul Sorvino plays Locklear's father and even that role isn't worth him even showing up for auditions for. While the film is well made technically, money is all talk in advertising this mediocre action film.

While Franklin is transported to jail on a prison bus, the bus is intercepted by mercenaries and Franklin is dragged onto a helicopter while handcuffed to another prisoner. When Franklin hears a plot to locate a cache of stolen diamonds, he manages to jump out of the helicopter when the mercenaries also plan to murder him. Franklin must also evade the police following his escape from custody as well as being framed for the murder of several police officers. Franklin enlists the help of James Russell, the reporter who initially put him in prison, for protection and to clear his name.Chris Tucker was a standout for this comedy. He was hilarious! Chris Tucker would also reunite with Brett Ratner for the Rush Hour trilogy.

A mildly entertaining, but repetitive flick for a late-night, TBS watch. It's odd how Charlie Sheen went from starring in one of the best war films of all time (Platoon) to silly movies like this. There are some laughs here, but most of the comedy is centered around Tucker's stereotypical urban blackness. Chris Tucker's only role in this movie (and others) is so that middle-class, white people can laugh at those silly black people. Sheen is a local TV reporter whose report on a local hustler (Tucker) helps get him arrested. When Tucker's character is framed for a murder he didn't commit, he turns to Sheen for help. If there's nothing else on television, give it a shot, but don't spend money on it. I recommend the similar, but better (still by no means fine cinema, but funnier and more entertaining than Money Talks) Rush Hour, also starring Tucker along with Jackie Chan.

When I saw the commercial for it, I wanted to see it because Chris Tucker was in it. Then years passed by, and no one really talked about the movie. Well I finally decided to see it, and boy am I glad that I punched myself in the face afterwards. This movie is very stupid. You learn the story in the first five minutes, that is to say you would learn the story if there was one.Chris Tucker is loud and obnoxious the entire movie. The funniest line in the movie was PHAT - Pretty Hot and Tempting. Unfortunately, they showed this line in the commercials for the theatrical debut. This movie is not funny despite the amount of profanity used. I'm usually a big fan of profanity, but it just wasn't working here.Basically the movie is one and a half hours of non-stop action. Here's something I don't get Tucker was seen associated with the bad guy, and so he thought he was framed, but why doesn't he clear his name? How is chasing after the bad guy and risking your life for no reason going to clear your name? Why do all the cops shoot first and ask questions later? This is in no way a portrait of real life, and I didn't expect it to be, but the amount of exaggeration in this movie is appalling and insulting. There's a difference between a good action movie, and a bad action movie. Just because there's a lot of action doesn't make it a good action movie. The action wasn't even that good.Tucker is a low-life hustler in this movie. How did he manage to be the coolest guy at the banquet? Why would the father of the bride actually believe he was someone else without looking at an ID or something? How could he possibly believe he was Italian? I suppose that could be funny if it wasn't outright stupid. Why does Tucker keep hustling? His home and his wife should've kept him straight, but I suppose it's because he was hustling that he has a wife and a good home. I shouldn't over analyze this tripe, after all it's just a comedy/action and it's not supposed to be taken seriously. It's best forgetting this movie was ever made.

However there was potential that I waited from the scriptwriters of (Toy Story &#x96; 1995) and (Goodbye Lover &#x96; 1998) to use, while they didn't. There are situations where the comedy could have been produced better (the party), or produced (the arm dealer's lair), but the action was the main point I guess, so it sure lost more chances for laughs.The buddy formula couldn't be felt. I mean (Charlie Sheen) wasn't given much of a character. All the lights are spotted on (Chris Tucker). Over and above, (Sheen) didn't do anything more than his usual Siberian performance and combing his hair well. They could have easily replaced him with a cardboard cutout !Although he's not that charismatic, and too annoying in many places, (Tucker) proved that he can be a star in a movie. I just hated his method that whenever the camera is rolling; I must not stop talking and talking and talking to an extent where they should have renamed the movie (Chris Tucker Talks)!.. It's not funny at all. Anyway, he sure looked better, and talked less in director (Brett Ratner)'s next movies (Rush Hour). But maybe it gives you a hint about the reason why (Tucker) doesn't work much out of that franchise. The start is really good and inspiring. And there is fair action, especially at the third act. However the second act went astray a bit. Some violence bothered me as well, but not like the very last scene, where the 2 leads accept a portion of stolen diamonds for themselves, even the clean-cut reporter. It's a matter that will inflame more loud objections 2 years later in another action comedy; (Money Train).In 1997, the buddy formula was sizzling. I believe it's the (Lethal Weapon)'s effect. Many buddy comedies were released  (Out to Sea), (Fathers' Day), (Gone Fishin'), (Good Burger), (Mousehunt), (Nothing to Lose), and (Trial and Error). Many buddy action too  (Men in Black), (Double Team), and (The Edge). I think (Money Talks) is a reasonable action, somehow far from being a comedy, and originally not a complete buddy movie, being so close to one man show. Not bad man, and not excellent show either. Well, averagely entertaining is the word then.Seriously there was nothing super but that chain of explosions at the end, which if there was more like it; it could have fit as better buddy for (Tucker) !

For example James Russell was very stern about befriending and even being spotted around with Franklin, but Franklin's personality was so outrageous that Mr. Russell just couldn't resist. Chris Tucker did an amazing job playing the role of Franklin, Chris Tucker is the star of the movie, and his jokes were just so crazy and funny!

The plot is good enough, I guess, but it seems like it was mainly just written to do a buddy comedy pairing up Tucker and Sheen, and comes off as a little forced. The film has a decent pace, but the main reason for watching the whole thing is, you guessed it, Tucker's performance(which is disappointing, since Sheen and Locklear both are known to be humorous and entertaining in other productions). The acting ranges, and at best is pretty good. Pretty much everyone but Tucker seem a little bored with their roles, and don't do very much to bring their characters to life. The characters are well-written and mostly credible. I did find the mix of characters somewhat humorous and thought out, even if a few of the major characters seemed to be clichés or stereotypes. The humor is pretty good, though some of it seems a little forced. Most of Tucker's scenes are good, though, and he mostly manages to entertain you. The dialog is fairly well-written and entertaining. All in all, for a failed attempt at a buddy comedy, it's decent. Tucker's performance pushes it just above average. The action is decent, as well.

All this movie is is a stage for Chris Tucker to perform on.  It's not out to win academy awards, it's out to entertain the 18-30 year olds, and that's exactly what it does.  As far as the profanity goers, how many of you have watched an Eddie Murphy movie on network television?  Kiss my gosh darn foot.  And suck my toes isn't funny.  Kiss my Motherf***ing a$$.

James Russell (Stone-faced Charlie Sheen, looking anemic in his business attire) is a determined, ambitious news reporter for Channel 12 who is more than interested in scooping out the best stories in the heat street. Both Hatchett and Russell inevitably collide with one another...and  like   two   positively    charged   ions...they do not have a very amiable relationship. However, when the two both happen to stumble upon a stash of valuable diamonds...no sooner do they find themselves in the midst of a sophisticated conspiracy involving international terrorists. Also, when murder and mayhem comes into play...the two end up running from the law as well...The two must put aside their differences if they are to work together. Unfortunately, that is going to take a lot of work.MONEY TALKS is Chris Tucker's first starring role.    He   is    great as a vituperative funnyman and a marvelous comedian. Tucker controls the scene and grabs all of the attention from the audience. This hyperactive comedian who shows an in-your-face fashion style is undeniably fabulous. He shows plenty of alacrity and self-assurance beneath the out of control exuberance. In short, Chris Tucker's  performance  makes   this  film bearable.It is a shame that the same lauds cannot be given towards the film as to Chris Tucker. MONEY TALKS is a silly, often pointlessly impudent film. The harsh profanity in this movie is enough to make both Howard Stern and Jerry Springer shudder. Even without the profanity, MONEY TALKS has very little strengths to redeem this film besides Chris Tucker of course! The plot is hackneyed, the characters (except for Chris Tucker's role as a cunning car washer) are uninteresting, and the bad guys are ludicrously stereotypical. Sheen himself is horrendous as a moronic news reporter. His acting fails to convey any depth, or any personality in contrast to Tucker's wildly vacillating performance.There are some exciting scenes with the myriad of shoot-outs, car chases and car wrecks, explosions, and the grand finale inside a football coliseum to keep the audience awake with the punctuating loud noises and blood boiling. The show stealing Chris Tucker is memorable and hysterical.  Still, MONEY TALKS becomes a tiring action-comedy, formulaic and paltry. Some plot elements in MONEY TALKS evidently do not make sense. Instances include incidents when it is so obvious that the bad guys have murdered innocent bystanders...yet the bone-headed cops happen to place all the blame on our two leading heroes. Also, why is it that the bad guys are always one step ahead of both Tucker and Sheen?It is sad to announce that the chemistry between Tucker and Sheen doesn't seem to balance... Sorry, it's just that the two are from completely different worlds. Chris Tucker is too motivated while Charlie Sheen is annoyingly...priggish and rigid. Sheen just doesn't have a sense of humor!In summary, MONEY TALKS is pure idiocy, but somewhat entertaining. Chris Tucker is the only saving grace and watch this movie just to see his astounding leading man debut. This mediocre action-comedy is enlivened by Tucker's way too enthusiastic performance. Otherwise, MONEY TALKS is incredibly unexciting. Again, if it was not for Chris Tucker, MONEY TALKS would have been a depressing movie.  MONEY TALKS is a satisfactory film to an extent, but not great by any means. An undistinguishable motion picture from hundreds of cliché buddy pictures.RATING ** out of ****.

This began with Lethal Weapon. There the comedy balance was divided between Glover and Gibson. But a lot of versions have come after, including the 3rd Die Hard, that thing with Rodman/Van Damme, or this film. It's as lame and short sight as any formula, but it worked for while. It doesn't anymore, and now while we see this, we wonder how it ever worked. This can only have a mild appeal on 2 levels.you saw the films while you were teenager, and so they become part of larger memories of your evolution, and seeing them is a wink at yourself..you assume how lame they are, and watch them on that base, as much as you watch a b film, filled with bad sets and laughable story lines, and assume that for the duration of the film.I did both of the above. But i know there's nothing here.There's actually an attempt to create a competent ending, the idea of a literal stage, where all the characters are brought, and all conflicts resolved, using the multiple possibilities that mise-en-scène allows. But it's all worked out through a vulgar shootout, and a few body fights with no history.My opinion 1/5http//www.7eyes.wordpress.com "},{"Title":"A Classic Funny Comedy","Date":"12 February 2003","Score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":"  Chris Tucker shows his amazing skills agian,Charlie Sheen also playing a great part in this.

He works at the local car wash. But he's also into ticket scalping. One day, a reporter, James Russell, comes to interview him and results in him getting arrested.         Franklin is loaded on to a prison bus with a man named Raymond Villard. Well, the bus ride to prison is smooth until some agents who work for Villard caused the bus to stop, then they boarded and killed all the prisoners, except for Franklin, who followed Villard and his right-hand man Dubray aboard a helicopter. Franklin escapes when they try to kill him. James Russell goes to find Franklin in order to interview him for sweeps week and perhaps clear his name. Franklin doesn't really trust James but it was better than staying out on the streets with the posibility of being killed.         Franklin must accompany James to dinner at his fianceé Grace's. Franklin disguises himself as Vic Damone Jr. Apparently, Guy, Grace's father was old friends with Vic Damone Sr. But before they can enjoy themselves, Franklin and James leave--and get chased by the cops.They then try a club in town where European people often hang out. They tail him and end up getting framed for the murder of a liquor store owner. They next go to a friend of Franklin's who deals in guns. Franklin got word that $15,000,000 in diamonds was hidden under the dashboard of a Jaguar at an Auto Expo. He had to get it before the bad guys did so he talked Guy into going down with him.       Franklin escapes Villard and Dubray again, who kidnap James and will trade him for the diamonds. They meet at the downtown colusseum at 3 AM where a giant battle ensues. In the end. The bad guys get their commuppance and Franklin and James are no longer criminals.        Funny movie. Chris Tucker is funny. Charlie Sheen is good too. If you liked this movie, I recommend Nothing to Lose. It's pretty much the same concept. Continuous use of the F-word and S-word by Tucker and Sheen is hilarious! But anyway, do see this movie.

Charlie Sheen is an investigative reporter that ends up interviewing Tucker, only to catch him being arrested by two undercover LAPD detectives.  He later ends up handcuffed to a French terrorist/diamond smuggler, a la Murphy's Law, where Kathleen Wilhoite (as a trashed-mouth hoodlum) and Charles Bronson (the framed cop that is implicated a la O.J. Simpson) were handcuffed together.  I wouldn't quit laughing at Tucker's jokes and comedic overtones, and after viewing the film, Money Talks is more of a modernization of 48 HRS.  Heather Locklear and Paul Sorvino have supporting parts in the film, but the finale in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum was a twist, where a loan shark (Damian Chapa of Blood In -- Blood Out fame) and his goons, the French terrorists, a crooked cop, and Tucker's homies have a showdown. I liked the scene where Tucker imitates Al Pacino's Cuban accent from Scarface, since he had sampled a few lines in his previous hit Friday, with Ice Cube.  Cool thing that he ended up with an Executive Producer credit, since all of his comedic lines and Jerry Springer-esque jive were incorporated.  Unlike Martin Lawrence, Tucker stands out as the Eddie Murphy of the 90s, since Beverly Hills Cop.  This film would later land Chris Tucker in another hit, Rush Hour, since his comedic lines with a tirade of profanity would make Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor legends.

This character's behavior is identical to his later character of the Rush Hour line (trilogy?) with one exception...he was still a bit in Ruby Rod mode from the Fifth Element. That fact alone lends at least some amusement to this almost workshop attempt between Charlie Sheen and Chris Tucker. Thankfully, Tucker hit in with Chan whose personality kicks it with Tucker's over the top, sometimes flamboyant, mostly big mouth style. Sheen played it too close to the vest. His character here is rather silent, but that's better than the few scenes in which he actually speaks, as Sheen's dialog delivery here will make most audiences cringe. It seems as though he's attempting the quiet brooding bad guy persona of Mel Gibson in the Lethal Weapon franchise, but Sheen just doesn't seem to pull it off. Nor does he pull off the hip bad boy persona he attempts on again and off again, throughout this work. Sheen must have been off his game here, as we all know that the bad boy is something he CAN do well..or could, at least, when he was younger. This was filmed in 1996/1997, so I have to assume he was just off his game, as that was the heyday of his nefarious bad boy personal life.This work is still a bit entertaining, if you can manage to ignore Sheen, and just enjoy the fun story line, the awesome performance by Paul Sorvino and funny man Chris Tucker, and the somewhat decent action/comedy blend.All in all, if you're bored, this is a fun choice, but if you have to make time for it, it may be somewhat of a disappointment.It rates 5.9/10 from...the Fiend .
