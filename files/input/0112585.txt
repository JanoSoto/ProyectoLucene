It is a conventional wisdom that a good story needs a beginning, a middle and an end, yet 'The Brothers McMullen' seems to be all middle - and engagingly so.  Burns gives us a glimpse into the lives of these three brothers as they struggle to find their way through personal emotional turning points and re-evaluate their belief systems.  The film is dominated by perceptive, sensitive and realistic dialogue throughout.  The dilemmas of these three brothers are instantly recognisable to anyone in their twenties or thirties, their inner conflicts easy to identify with. This film is beautifully acted, and particularly likeable is Mike McGlone as the youngest brother who desperately tries to hold on to what he believes is his genuine Catholic conviction whilst searching for 'true love'.  Burns' script is witty, warm, honest and wonderfully unpretentious.  Burns himself turns in a great performance of the ever-maligned man who is 'afraid of commitment', yet somehow manages to remain intensely appealing and prevents his character from appearing to be a clich√©.  A rare gem among contemporary movies - one which is fuelled by words and not actions. Refreshing.

I have to say that I liked it in spite of its flaws. It just had this superficial, breezy feel to it, like it's really not a movie but a pilot for a sit-com. All it's missing is the laugh-track.The stories about the three brothers were well done, especially Barry's story (the middle brother). But I kept thinking the most interesting character in this story is the dead father, and he's not even in the movie. The brothers mention their father several times, usually in some disparaging way. You don't find out many facts about him, except that their mother never loved him. Apparently the sons didn't love him either.The three brothers are desperate, each in their own way, to not end up like their father. The dead Mr. McMullen was characterized as an alcoholic, wife-abusing, stern and unhappy man. And yet Mr. McMullen had no trouble committing to one woman, which apparently Barry can't manage to do. Mr. McMullen remained faithful (apparently) in a 35 year marriage and raised 3 sons, which oldest son Jack can't bring himself to do. Mr. McMullen remained true to his religious and cultural upbringing, which youngest son Patrick is about to turn his back on when he splits for California.So maybe that father wasn't such a failure after all. The sons won't realize this until they become husbands and fathers themselves. But they haven't reached that point yet, they're still growing up and figuring things out. It's nice to see how they help each other and take turns giving parental advice to each other.I'd like to see this same story with these same characters, told 20 years before, and 20 years after the time of this movie. I'd like to meet the mother in Ireland as she greets her American grandchildren. Now that would be an interesting sequel.

He has the ability to make great, touching movies about REAL characters, and the humor is never far away. This is a very funny movie, with some unforgettable scenes (e g see the Summary). The actors do their jobs with a presence rarely seen on film. They never once overact, and everything they say or do seems natural.There is one major flaw in the movie though, but I'm not going to give it away. I can say this though It has something to do with the time.I saw this one after I saw She's the One and there are some similarities. However, this doesn't effect either movie in a negative way. In fact; I love both of them equally. I just wish I could get hold of No Looking Back. It hasn't been released here in Sweden yet (not even on video).Well... anyway, if you for some reason haven't seen The Brothers McMullen - or She's the One for that matter - I suggest you run the the nearest video store right now and rent it (preferably both), or better yet buy them!

The story is about several weeks in the lives of three bothers. Circumstances (what they are is unimportant) have caused the two younger bachelor brothers to move in with their older married brother and his family. The script explores the relationships between three loving Irish Catholic American brothers, each with a distinctive personality, and the relationships each has with the women in their lives. It's about real love and romance (not the sappy romantic comedy type), fears of commitment, and the twists and turns these men go through in dealing with that aspect of their lives. Their Catholicism has a lot to do with the story. At one point Patrick says to his Jewish girl friend, I go to Church every week; you go to Temple only once or twice a year. She replies, Yes, but your religion is crazy. Although the most religious of the three, Patrick, goes against the Church's teachings in that he uses condoms; but, he worries about going to Hell should he commit other serious sin. Marriage to all of them means a life-long commitment. Their mother's life set the standard for them. She had lived 35 years in a forced, loveless marriage until her husband passed away. That freed her to go to the man she had been in love with when circumstances caused her to marry the boys' father. Abortion was out of the question, as was divorce.Ed Burns is credited with writing and directing the film and he also is very credible as the middle brother. While the entire cast made their characters seem real, the actor who in my mind stood out is Mike McGlone, who plays Patrick, the youngest brother who has a kind of altar boy personality. Perhaps Ed Burns' choice of camera angles gets some of the credit for making his performance particularly memorable, but McGlone brought something special to that part.

For those reasons alone, this film holds a special place in my movie-loving heart than others I have seen before.Having said that, you don't have to be Irish-American or even male to love this movie. Sure, it looks grainy even on DVD, but any movie fan can tell you that it's not how clear a movie is or how much it costs, but how good the characters are or the story is. For this movie, both criteria was met.Edwards Burns wrote this film brilliantly, for starters. Burns wrote himself as the funnyman, and he did a great job with that role. He has some very memorable lines, most especially the part where he's talking to his younger brother Patrick (Mike McGlone) about women's ways while using a banana. Other writers would have stooped really low with such a prop, but Burns used it metaphorically in a way that was both funny and smart. He also had great chemistry with Maxine Bahns. Of course, Burns didn't leave all the funny lines to himself.Mike McGlone is also very good as Patrick, the younger brother who uses his Catholic upbringing as an excuse not to marry his longtime girlfriend. His character is perhaps the most interesting because he's so complex and has many contradictory qualities he loves but is afraid to commit, he's religious but abides by the rules when convenient, and he's smart but does really dumb things. Contrast that performance to his role in Burns' followup, She's The One, and you'll see that McGlone is one of the most underrated actors working today.Of course, with the movie centering around the three brothers, not mentioning Jack Mulcahy as older brother Jack would be blasphemous. Mulcahy played a very good straight man to Burns and McGlone. The movie makes you believe in the beginning that he has everything together, but he eventually loses it. However, he does so in an understated way that seems very realistic in a lot of ways. You'd have to see the movie to find out.There's not too much else to say about the movie it just worked! The dialogue was brilliantly written and perfectly executed by the entire cast, the situations were entirely believable, and the on-location shooting in New York was a brilliant move on Burns' part. It's as if New York was its own character. Being from New England, seeing the New York Yankees clothing some of the cast wore got under my skin a little, but I won't get too picky.Although Edward Burns got his due for this movie (Winner of Best Picture at Sundance, Two Thumbs Up from Siskel & Ebert), he hasn't really gotten the respect he deserves since this film was made. He's directed eight movies as of the date this review has been written, and my guess is that in another ten years, he will earn the same respect as Woody Allen and Albert Brooks from film critics and fans alike. He had a great start as a young independent filmmaker, and I know he'll make more good films as a director as well.

It has the intimate immediacy of MARTY, another such tale about a lonely Brooklyn butcher looking for true love and the right marriage prospect to end his bachelor days.In THE BROTHERS McMULLEN we have MARTY compounded by three--namely, the Irish brothers on Long Island who seem to indulge in endless dialog about life, love and the pursuit of happiness while sipping their favorite beers, each involved in a troublesome relationship that has them questioning their inner conflicts born by a Catholic conscience.It's not exactly up to the Woody Allen standard of such tales, but the dialog is fresh enough and natural, the modest settings are appropriate for the story and the jaunty Irish music on the soundtrack does its job.Nothing complex here. Just a warm, engaging, occasionally funny tale of average guys struggling with their fixed ideas of moral values, each unable to come to terms with inner conflicts--and two of them simply unable to make commitments to the women they love.The film is really carried by the three brothers EDWARD BURNS as the one least able to commit, and JACK MULCAHY and MIKE McGLONE as his troubled siblings.Summing up Nothing really special, but it did win a couple of awards at film festivals.

So really it's an unbelievable effort to produce a movie for this amount of money and win a Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival in 1995, as well as recognition for Ed Burns as an all-round director/actor/producer/writer extraordinaire. The end product being The Brothers McMullen; a project made literally in his own backyard, using his own friends and associates as his crew (such as his 'then' girlfriend who is his girlfriend in the film and his friend).The protagonist is Burns' character Barry, the middle brother, who is the wittiest, has the sharpest lines, and many would think the film is partly autobiographical because of this. Barry is a writer, jumps from woman to woman, makes wise guy remarks, and then he meets Audrey, played by Maxine Bahns, and is forced to get over his fear of commitment. How does he deal with it? Jack, the older brother, is a middle-aged teacher, who's quieter and loves his wife, but has to deal with the feelings of infidelity. How does he deal with it? Then there's Patrick, the younger religious sibling, a do-gooder who's soon to get married into a Jewish family, but he gets cold feet. Then hot feet. Then cold feet. He then gets his fianc√© pregnant. Then he meets someone else. He then has to deal has to deal with the guilt. Or does he learn not to? Three very different brothers, the three Irish New Yorkers feed each other their advice and wisdom of love. It's not an original plot, but it works. Conversations flow from JFK, women, families, love, alcohol, their violent father, to family bonding, with a whole lot of swearing in between and Irish fiddle music in the background. Burns is something of a Plastic Paddy. Nevertheless, there's a lot of great word play, the plot isn't pretentious or trying to be too clever. It's heart-warming, without being soppy.Minus points one can appreciate Burn is an all-rounder, but he should maybe step outside his own box and become a character in the movie &#150; stop writing and starring as himself &#150; it's a bit egotistical. The acting was a bit amateur, especially Maxine Bahns &#150; though this can be forgiven for the fact they were at the time just that - amateurs. The editing was a bit disjointed in places. It doesn't flow as well as it could do. Then again, it only cost, as stated ¬£15,000. It has to be expected.I appreciated it a lot. A debut movie, that cost ¬£15,000, cannot get much better. If you like Irish-American culture, take pleasure of budget movies and enjoy witty rom-coms &#150; try this.

The story is utterly banal, the characters are banal, thinly drawn and not just unsympathetic but entirely uninteresting and self-absorbed, and the direction childish.  The camera and lighting is not just amateurish but seems nearly to be deliberately self-sabotaged. Now let's get on to the illustrious Edward Burns - who has derived such attention and acclaim for this little gem of a film.  In watching other films in which he appeared (Saving Private Ryan, 15 Minutes), I was struck by just how inexpressive, wooden and plastic-like his characters were.  Yet he was said to be excellent in this film, so I tried to keep an open mind as I watched this film.What did I discover?  That Mr. Burns was no better in this film than he was in the others.  I learned that Burns' sole talent is staring into the camera trying to pretend to convey meaning through his sad-sack eyes, yet he isn't capable of conveying ANYTHING - the man is essentially a mute when it comes to any sort of meaningful communication to the audience.I can't imagine how any person watching this film could have come away with a positive impression of it - there simply isn't any part of it that I would recommend to anyone else.

Written in the tradition of other no-budget classics El Mariachi and Metropolitan, Burns manages to do something that those films couldn't. While Robert Rodriguez had sharp and witty dialogue, it was the bullets and blood that made El Mariachi as exciting as it was. While Metropolitation kept you on the edge of your seat for the first half an hour, my interest lagged as the film progressed. The Brothers McMullen, on the other hand, uses a completely dialogue driven script to excite the audience for the complete duration of the picture.

When i saw that Edward Burns had written, produced and directed movies himself, i thought, hey, why not! I never thought movies like this could be so good. It was such an entertaining piece that i had to recommend it to people. I loved how Burns showed the realistics of modern day relationships, how some marriages can overcome problems, and some can't, and how people are afraid of commitment until they are in love. Filled with great dialogue (the banana scene) and good plot, this is a sweet movie for those hopeless romantics, or those who just want a good laugh.

However, the similarities ended when an abundance of profanity and sexual dialogue were added to them as well as casts for the MTV generation. The Brothers McMullen is a prime example of all of this and not a very good one at all. Weak and contrived. Writer-director-star Edward Burns tries to be another Woody Allen but hasn't quite gotten there yet.

It's truly horrible. I mean what was the point? Lapsed Catholics are troubled people? None of the male characters is the least bit interesting or sympathetic. They are all total zeros. Given that the three brothers are absolute jerks, the contrived, blissful happy ending which is completely predictable is not in the least bit warranted in any of the three couples lives. The profanity is on a par with the number of beers consumed. I think I should have had a few before sitting down to this. The wife of the eldest brother who is married is about the only interesting character in the movie. She should apply for sainthood for sticking with a cheating husband. As far as I am concerned this is just more Catholic bashing from that Hollywood can not get enough of. Don't spend a minute watching this dreadful film.

The Long Island Rail Road station was Gibson. It brought back a lot of good memories. The movie captured much of the essence of the times and the neighborhood. I loved it. The characters seemed to be just like the people living there. I know many of the actors were from the area though I did not know them. His father being a NYPD Sergeant and his Mom working in the JFK Airport were indicative of many of the people living in this area. The Irish factor was also a sign of the area. My father was also Irish and worked as a Policeman in the same town where the film was shot. Great work. I am so appreciative of the movie. "},{"Title":"No Schulz, Yul Brynner is not in this one! That's THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV!!","Date":"23 February 2009","Score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" HAVING heard so much about this Film from our 2 Daughters (Jenn & Michelle Ryan), we never did make the trip to the Cineplex or to Classic Video Rental to actually see it for ourselves. Time went by and with the hum-drum of day to day work and survival; it went back onto the back-burners of memory; only to occasionally be put ever so briefly into the spotlight; via its being listed in the Weekly Movies on TV listings.FINALLY last evening, Fox Movie Channel had it on. It was Saturday, February 21st, In the Year of Our Lord 2009. Quite appropriately, this was Oscar Night Eve. We would not only have seen a great, low budget film; but also it provided an excellent way of contrasting a brilliant piece of Cinematic Art, as opposed to some of the out and out schlock that passes for a Movie nowadays.TODAY'S sacrificial lamb and Ryan Film Hall of Fame Inductee, THE BROTHERS McMULLEN (Brothers McMullen Productions/Marlboro Road Gang Productions/Videpgraphy Productions/Fox Searchlight Pictures, 1995) is a great example of a precursor of great things to come. Though the film has specificity of both setting and ethnicity of the principals; and yet, the story, the incidents and the final outcome of the story are all truly universally applicable to any and all segments of this or any other society.BEING a practicing Catholic of at least half Irish Descent (the other 50% being of the Teutonic Persuasion), we were able to truly identify with the characters, setting and situations in the movie. Our background was in Blue Collar (Proletariat to you Left Wingers), Parochial (Catholic) Schools and Democratic Political affiliations*. As a 14 year Irish High Schooler, old former Altar Boy,** it was a joyous day when JFK got the Democratic nod and nomination in 1960; with ever even more ecstatic days ahead when he and running mate, LBJ, won the election that November.ALL of the previous exposition was necessary to lay the groundwork for the proof; being that we understand everything here. So, we get it! Enough said already! EXPERTLY mixing all of the problems that we all face as we are growing deeper into adulthood and leaving the days adolescence far behind us, the Writer-Director-Co-Producer-Lead Actor, Edward Burns, manages to touch all of the bases in the slightly over 1 ¬Ω Hours Running Time (98 minutes, to be exact). Adding fuel to the fire is the lack of any real family support; with the McMullen Clan being ever so dysfunctional. It is revealed that following the death of their abusive, alcoholic Father that their Mother split, going back to Ireland. It appears, as she confided to her Sons that there was someone she truly loved there. She had married Old Man McMullen because he had knocked her up! (Hell, where were these Colleens when I needed them!)SERIOUSLY though folks, Mr. Burns manages to blend all aspects of life with generous helpings of love, self-preservation, sex, acceptance and security being related in serious, humorous and even in pathetic moods. There seems to have been a natural instinct driving Mr. Edward Burns in his piecing together this jigsaw puzzle.AND to think, Mr. Burns reportedly brought it all together for a measly $17,000.00; which wouldn't pay a catering bill on a weeks worth of shooting on a major film. This BROTHERS McMULLEN project has proved his worth as Actor, Writer, Producer and Director.MOST importantly, this film proved young Burns' talents in possibly the most important area; that being 'the Bottom Line' A$ we all know, thi$ i$ probably the mo$t important a$pect of making the Movie$ a$ it concern$ all of the $uit$ back at the Big $tudio$ and Di$tributor$!NOTE * In viewing things in a generalized manner, some have sized me up as 1. Irish, 2. Catholic, 3. Democrat, with a 4. City Job (Chicago Cop for 35 years). Although I am only half Irish (the other half of the pedigree being German), a Conservative and a card-carrying Republican. Ma & Pa, the Late Clement and Bertha Ryan, both loyal New Deal Democrats, are surely resting quite uneasily with what their Democratic Party has become and what these socialists are trying to do with our Republic.NOTE ** Yeah, I was an Altar Boy, at St. Theodore Parish in Chicago, circa 1957-59. And just to set the record straight, honest, Fr. Chambers, I never drank any Altar Wine.POODLE SCHNITZ!!

They each deal with true love, marriage, and infidelity respectively. Whenever you see that dreaded buzzword highly acclaimed or worse darling of critics, you'd be best advised NOT to get your hopes up. If you do you'll be let down time and time again. Such is the case with this film as well. If however you go in expecting a mediocre movie you're still be let down but not nearly as much. This starts off OK, but gets too long winded. And whenever a character has an internal monologue it becomes laughably bad. Overall I wouldn't want to spend time with anyone in the film. So in that way it's like Seinfield, but minus the laughs. However, it still is good for an indy film.My Grade C+ Where I saw it Starz Classics "},{"Title":"Aspiring filmmakers take note","Date":"25 July 2004","Score":"1 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" I'm a big Edward Burns fan, since he's shown time and time again that it's possible to make an interesting film on a low budget that simply focuses on people and their relationships with one another. I always feel that the best movies are ones that I can most relate to. The reason why I don't even have a slight urge to see any of the Lord of the Rings films is because what is there to relate to in those stories? How am I supposed to connect with characters who are saving the world from monsters? However, I can relate to the characters and situations in Edward Burns's films. I feel like I'm part of their lives. And most importantly, they talk like REAL people! Burns has a knack for sharp, yet realistic dialogue. The movie was shot on an extremely, and I mean extremely, low budget. I learned a lot from Burns's DVD commentary and he gives a lot of confidence to aspiring student filmmakers like myself. Most of the locations are either in someone's house, in the park or on the sidewalks. There ya go! No permits, no shooting within private property--yet is it sacrificing the integrity of the film? Not one bit. The film stock itself isn't the best of quality, but that goes to show audiences that a movie doesn't have to be visually spectacular to be good. Good script and good actors--that's what you need.End of story! Burns could've shot the whole movie on an old video camera, and that wouldn't have made the finished product any less effective. Now, onto what didn't work about this film. Low-budget doesn't exactly translate to low quality, but there's usually at least a few sacrifices to be made. For example, some of the acting in The Brothers McMullen is wooden. What surprised me was that Jack Mulcahy is the only actor in the cast with previous experience, and he's the worst of the bunch! He delivers his lines with hardly any emotion and rarely changes his facial expression. Maxine Bahns, who basically was hired because she was Burns's girlfriend at the time, isn't a great actress and proves that she's not much more than a pretty face. Mike McGlone gives the best performance, as he seems the most natural and comfortable with his role. People tend to criticize Edward Burns as an actor, and he's no Robert DeNiro, but at the same time he's good at playing an extension of himself. Some actors, or performers I should say, are good at playing one type of role and there's nothing wrong with that. The Brothers McMullen is not a brilliant film, but it's very good for its budget and serves as a fine escape from all these corny special effects extravaganzas.

Jack is happily married but is falling into a reckless affair, Barry is scared to commit and is threatening to be a bachelor for life while Patrick is a devote catholic who is struggling with the idea that his Jewish girlfriend has mapped his whole life out for him.  Can they work out the differences between men and women and get their lives in order.This was Burn's first feature and was made on a total shoestring budget.  However the grainy film style is not a bad thing and the film is made to feel lively by the rough nature and witty dialogue of the characters.  The story is not exactly rocket science (men and women are different) and the &#145;happy' ending is a little pat, but overall it works well.  The stories are littered with plenty of wit and humour and is amusing if not fantastic.The performances are quite rough and ready.  Burns is not great in the lead - he feels like a sub-par Woody Allen as he makes his observations etc.  Mulcahy is OK but not great while McGlone is probably the best of the bunch.  Connie Britton (best known for Spin City) holds her own and is good.  But lets not forget this was never a top-notch film with the best cast available.  That said, Burns and the rest's proximity to the material make them appear quite natural.Overall it's not earth shattering - it's quite slow and is rarely laugh out loud funny.  At times you get tired of hearing the cast complain about their relationships all the time, but for the most part it has enough charm and wit to keep the interest. "}]
