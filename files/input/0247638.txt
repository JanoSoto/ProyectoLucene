[{"Title":"Entertaining","Date":"24 February 2004","Score":"59 out of 63 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Romance","Review":"  I will admit that when I first heard a Disney movie called The Princess Diaries was coming out, I thought it would be corny. But upon actually SEEING the film, I found (as is usually the case when stupid judgmental people make up their mind about films without watching them, I won't name names, you know who you are...Tom!) that it was in reality a charming, original, humorous and thoroughly entertaining family film.The plot is fairy tale in nature Mia is a social misfit with terrible hair and no self-confidence. Her only friends are eccentric activist Lilly and rock band headliner Michael (played by real-life rocket Robert Carmine of Rooney) who has a little crush on her. Then, who of all people should turn up but Julie Andrews to tell Mia that her father (who she hasn't seen since she was tiny) was actually royalty and that she, Mia, was princess of a country no one's ever heard of. What it comes down to is this She has until a big embassy ball to decide whether she wants to give up the crown (and basically open the country up to a hostile political takeover) or take her place as princess. After a makeover (at the hands of funnyman Larry Miller), some training and at least four horrendously traumatizing incidents, she decides...well, that would be giving it away, wouldn't it?This is not a movie for little girls dressed in tutus who want to be princesses when they grow up. For the first time in the studio's tenure (I'd wager) this film depicts the responsibility of royalty. Mia tackles with the pressures of ruling a country. But for my money the best part of this movie is the love story. No, not Mia and the uniquely attractive rocker (although, that is great). A second, unscripted love story exists between Andrews and her chauffeur, Hector Elizondo. That's terrific.It's about being yourself and bettering yourself. It's about knowing who your real friends are. It's about living up to your own expectations. It's about smushing an ice cream cone on the blouse of a bitchy cheerleader who deserves it. And maybe that sounds corny to all y'all (rustic expression) but I know a lot of adults who could use lessons like these.

As a parent I often have to suffer through books my children read to me, music they like, and television shows & movies that I have no desire to see. The previews made this movie look like the standard Disney channel fluff I occasionally have to endure. However, I found that I actually enjoyed this movie.Garry Marshall basically redressed his PRETTY WOMAN storyline for kids. He even brought in Hector Elizondo, the hotel manager in PW, as the head security officer for the Queen of Genovia, who is played by Julie Andrews. The story also has aspects of the LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY novel in it.The story is not all that original. A long lost heir to the throne of Genovia has been identified as a klutzy teenager who lives in San Francisco. The Queen of Genovia goes to San Francisco and attempts to persuade her to come back to Genovia and take her place as a princess of the realm. From their the typical hijinks ensue. The princess gets an education in proper royal behavior & procedures. The Queen learns to loosen up and relax. Princess Mia also struggles between dating the school jock, who ignored her before she became famous and dating an unpopular guy who has been her friend for years.The story is predictable and hold no real surprises. Despite this I still found myself enjoying the film. Julie Andrews did well in her role as the Queen and it was a treat to see her in another Disney film. I was surprised by how well Anne Hathaway did in her role as Princess Mia. She held her own against such performers as Andrews and Elizondo. This movie could have come off as cheezy but thanks to the director and skilled actors it proved to be a real treat. I remember back in 1990 when PW came out that girls thought it was so romantic that a hooker could find romance, true love and wealth. In my opinion PD is a much better role model. I'd rather have my little girl wishing she that she was heir to throne than a hooker who happens to find true love. Anyway, thanks to my daughter I discovered a film that I really enjoyed It is also because of her that I just saw the sequel, PD-2. It was even better than PD.

One day, on the contrary, she was told to be the Princess of a country, which is very opposite to her former expectation. What a big turning to her life ! What she will undergo ? Mia is my very first and memorable impression about this movie. Anything about her comes from Anne Hathaway's virgin performance. After deeply understand the character-Mia, Anne let Meg's story vivid on the screen. Her acting is natural and every detail show a combination of her own understanding of the character and the shining of the character itself. I noticed some details about Mia,which is very sophisticated. Mia's school uniform represent the 1950's elegance. The black socks and ties. What a copy of Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's. Mia's smile remind me of another famous actress-Julie Roberts, who has become a mother recently. The beautiful big smile is very eye-catching and also memorable. Oh,I remember another person who also have those big smile. She is Am√©lie Poulain. The Story is philanthropic and extraordinary.It's not simply a Cinderella story.But, a great story about grandmother and granddaughter, a education-valued story about mother and daughter, a special story about father and daughter,a ever-sweet story about first love, a beautiful story about friendship. Above all, it's a growing story. Based on Meg's classic story The Princess Diary, the motion picture make her characters believe-like in another artistic way. Just like having read Margaret's story (Gone With The Wind), you then watch O'Selznick's GWTW movie. Your feeling will be like I seemed to be a part of the story. Those characters are just and always around you! Clarisse The Sound of Music is recognized as a movie that is priceless, so, this also recognized the supporting actress's performance is priceless. Julie is an actress that could act well on any characters. The governess,the grandmother or on Broadway, etc. Helen (Caroline Goodall) played a vital role is Mia's growing period. This daughter and mother is a good role model. Because they show the grand respect for each other. Anyone can't grow without friend, the princess,too. From the friendship with Lilly, Mia knows how to tell the truth, how to apologize and how to deal with something that is uniquely occurred in teenager, which is called Growing Pains. Like other reviewers, I also feel the last sentence Mia told Michael is Soooooooo...... Cool ! -O You saw me when I was invisible. Why we feel cool ? Because that's what true love is. And, especially, that's what true love is to a princess !! Joe is a person we can't ignore. He acted as a imitate friend to Mia. He told her what she should be. And he is virtually the bodyguard. Oh, by the way, he is a very very special one ! Some of the songs in The Princess Diary is also memorable. A Summer Song remind me of those romantic school kisses. The final song Miracles Happen is special designed for this movie, for Mia and also for all of us. Now, I am recommending this movie to YOU from my heart.

There's nothing here that would cause you to blush even a little bit as you watch this with your 8 year old. The strongest language used is shut up - and it was quickly explained to the Queen that in America shut up doesn't necessarily mean be quiet; it might just mean wow!There's a strong cast. Hathaway put on a very good performance in the lead role of Mia, moving from shy and awkward teenager, to sudden celebrity causing her to have to deal with being popular not for who she is but for what she is, to - finally - elegant princess. Julie Andrews was - well - Julie Andrews. She didn't miss a beat in her portrayal of Queen Clarisse, and Hector Elizondo handled the role of Joseph - Mia's driver and bodyguard - with great style.It's a fun movie. Nothing heavy, nothing that will cause you to think too much. Just nice, light fun.

I think that Julie Andrews completely made the movie and that Anne Hathaway also did an excellent job. The movie is great for people of all ages because it has a simplistic plot yet has great one liners and great repartee between the characters of the Queen and Princess Mia.

In the end, this movie ranked no.19 in the top 20 movie list of the year 2001, grossing more than 100 million at the box office&#133;.something which it completely deserved. Julie Andrews, makes a sudden re-appearance as Queen Clarise. Though she does fit perfectly to what the casting director's envisage of the Queen, there is something that does not fit, to make it perfect. However, that does not stop anyone from not enjoying the movie and having fun. Mandy Moore's debut performance&#133;well was HORRIBLE (listen to her cover version of 'Stupid Cupid'- its even worst than her acting)! But because Anne Hathaway's character was brought out with a lot of strength, all these minor faults seemed invisible. Hector Elizondo was equally good as the chauffeur Joe. He had wit and the personality. Heather Matarazzo always plays a freak, and in this case, it is still the same.This may be a kiddie movie, but I believe it was made for everyone to enjoy it- and it did serve it's purpose. I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH and would make a great recommendation, for anyone who just wants to make movie night fun.

In my opinion, it's not the acting that totaled it, it's the stupid plot/corny dialogue that threw the last dirt onto the grave.****SPOILERS*****Basically, Disney dumbed the entire plot of Meg Cabot's series for the twelve-and-under set.  Instead of Mia's father having testicular cancer, and Mia's parents never being married, Mia's father divorced her mother and then died tragically.And then there's the whole Grandmere scandal.  In the novels, Grandmere is the antagonist a scary pain in the ass grandmother who Mia constantly struggles against. In the movie, Mia and Grandmere suddenly become best friends.Plus, what's with the yoga?  And debate class?  Mr. G and Mia's inability to do Algebra and sports are comic reliefs in the book.In my opinion, had they followed the books more and NOT Disney-ed it up, the movie would have been okay.I loved the casting for Michael & Lilly Moscovitz, as well as Lana.

Basically socially awkward but bright San Francisco 15-year old teenager Mia Thermopolis (debuting Anne Hathaway) raised by single mother Helen (Caroline Goodall) discovers that she is related to royalty. She can't believe that she is the daughter of the deceased Prince of Genovia, with his wife Queen Clarisse Renaldi (Dame Julie Andrews) as Grandmother, who tells her she has to decide whether or not to take his place. For a while Mia tries to live normally with this revelation being secret, even after being primped up, but she is being stalked by the press when the truth is blurted out. It looks like she is convinced of saying no, but changes her mind after reading a letter from her father, and she is a real princess by the end. Also starring Hector Elizondo as Joe, Heather Matarazzo as Lilly Moscovitz, Mandy Moore as Lana Thomas, Robert Schwartzman as Michael Moscovitz, Escape to Witch Mountain's Erik Von Detten as Josh Bryant, Sandra Oh as Vice Principal Gupta and Larry Miller as Paolo the Hairdresser.

The film is warm, sweet and fun. It also has the obligatory moral message about egocentricity being bad. Mia also makes the point of her being the same person before and after being a princess. I think it is an important point, as contrary to popular belief, status does not really change who you really are.

I was an intensely tomboyish preteen and pretty much against all media with the word Princess even associated with it. Needless to say, I was not super excited when my cousins came over and popped this bad boy(err..girl) in our VCR. I honestly didn't expect much Disney, princess, tiaras, romance, please.But as I began watching it, I soon realized that I identified completely with Mia,(Anne Hathaway) an extremely awkward teenage girl who was rebellious, weird, unpopular, and yet, was offered the one thing that almost all teenage girls dream of princess-ship, complete with new looks, limos, balls, gowns, hot guys, and power. Whoop!Yet, she practically had to be dragged into it kicking and screaming. Forget preppy hair do's! Just leave me alone! Here was a princess story I could relate to! Mia wasn't some whistling girl with a pure heart who caught birds on her fingers while working at a terrible job, that really wasn't that terrible because she made it fun! She was an ungraceful chick who had learned to cope with the hardships of life, but not in the usual way. Everything about her was weird, and she liked it like that.But Mia had to grow up during this movie. She went from awkward to awesome in a matter of two hours. I loved the transformation were she went from laughed at, to applauded for by the end when she slams ice cream all over Lana's(Mandy Moore) cheer leading outfit(something I personally loved because I was not particularly fond of cheer leading at this point..) Overall, great chick/ teen girl flick. It makes you believe that no matter how messed up your life is or you are, you still have a chance to be some super cool girl. And who doesn't want to be a princess? Really.

Because of all this, you would assume that I would hate THE PRINCESS DIARIES--I sure did. But when my oldest daughter insisted we buy this film and watch it together, I was genuinely shocked that I found myself enjoying and being sucked into what is essentially a teen and pre-teen girls' film. Due to terrific writing, very good acting and a fairy tale-like quality to the film, I was very, very impressed.The movie, by the way, reminded me of a much better retooling of the old Grace Kelly film, THE SWAN. However, unlike THE SWAN, this film was really engaging and sweet.FYI--SPOILER ALERT!!! I have never seen the sequel to THE PRINCESS DIARIES and have no desire to. That's because the fundamental message in the first movie is that you need to be true to yourself and your friends and no matter what the pressures were, the new princess did not forget her friends or nerdy boyfriend. However, the main plot idea of PRINCESS DIARIES II is that she's in search of a prince to marry--what happened to the message and happy ending to PRINCESS DIARIES?!

Definitely not part of the target audience (though I do consider myself young at heart!) I was charmed by Ms Hathaway's naivety and photogenic presence and the always reliable Julie Andrews who wonderfully never takes herself too seriously, poking fun at her family-friendly screen persona. Garry Marshall demonstrates his talents of sweet irresistible romantic comedies in what could be called his follow-up to his 1990 smash Pretty Young Woman. And with Hathaway, he has found his 21st century young muse.The storyline fits perfectly into the soapsud daydreams of all young ladies. Never the popular kid graced with mawkish looks and a geeky personality, Mia Thermopolis resigns herself to a life of miserable loneliness and school bullies. However, in a moment of emancipation, she is uncovered by her Grandmother Clarisse Renaldi and when told that she is the last remaining bloodline of a royal family, she must take over the throne of the idealistic kingdom of Genovia. Cue Cinderella-like transformation and plenty of vivacious trying on of clothes and groovy pop tunes.The film has a simple but great (even hackneyed) message at heart, to be true to yourself and never forget that your friends and family can be the most honest and important in your life. It could have come off contrived and cheesy but the film still conveys heartwarming moments and a sincere semblance.There is great energy in the film and some of the scenes in the palace and garden are quite picturesque and dreamy. The storyline can be pretty thin considering the good-guy-bad-guy syndrome but Mia's closest friends are still commendable and mature young people capturing the trials and tribulations of teenage fitting in, first loves, peer pressure, pressure from Mums and Dads and realisation of adult responsibilities.I had a really fun time with this film, absorbed in it's fairytale story lines and taking myself back to when I was young and naive. Thanks to the irresistible company and chemistry of the two female leads I was able to totally identify with their dilemmas. This film has Disney written all over it. A good simple message at heart and fully of quirky side characters and a charismatic underdog. Lovely to look at and listen to (I went out afterwards to check out the soundtrack!), this one always brings a smile to my face whenever I catch it on TV - I had a good time.

Lots of reviewers and critics are not happy with what they see in The Princess Diaries what I say is what's wrong with it?. I'll agree that there is hardly any action or violence in it but isn't it about time that movies these days ought to be softened up a bit? Pirates of the Carabian and the Lord of the Rings Trilogy were successful and they are disturbingly violent and rather grim. This film is very easy-going. The story is simple, Mia (Anne Hathaway) is a self-conscious teenager who wants to lead a quiet, happy life but when her abrupt grandmother (Julie Andrews) travels from Europe to America to tell her that she is a princess of a large country. Mia is totally shocked and her grandmother expects her to be calm and think nothing of it - how harsh is that? Mia's warmhearted mother makes a compromise that she would attend princess-lessons and if she really doesn't want to accept becoming a princess then she doesn't have to. The Queen still isn't impressed but this helps Mia feel better about attending Princess-lessons and reluctantly does so. Being an all-American, rather an affected-by-hormones kind of girl things don't go to plan especially when Mia thinks she has won the affections of a teen-aged boy she is sexually attracted to who goes to her school but she doesn't know that she is being used in order for him to become famous. The Queen is very angry about how much she let the royal family down. Mia tries to explain that she didn't do it deliberately but the Queen won't listen. A few days later the Queen comes to Mia's house and apologises. The night the grand ball takes place for Mia's speech, her heart is telling her that being a princess would be the right thing and so she announces to everyone at the ball that she will be the new princess of the European country. Now hearing the story I've briefly explained, how is that rubbish? It's interesting, fun, romantic, extremely funny, heartwarming and all it has missing is the violent action and horror audiences today expect from a good movie, and to me that is a very good thing. I advise you to give it a go - you might be surprised.

However, Pygmalion got its own remake with a new title 'My Fair Lady' with Audrey Hepburn.As Queen Clarisse would say to a comment regarding Pygmalion to Princess Diaries ... tosh!And I am inclined to back her up. So,if you have nothing nice to say about anything then ... do what Ronan Keating does... say nothing at all!!

The words 'Now A Major Motion Picture' were right across the front. I decided to buy it and read it, since the movie looked interesting enough and the short description on the back of the book sounded good. A week after I read it, I saw the movie and was highly disappointed. The book was a very well-written story meant for the younger teen set. The movie was a piece of fluff designed for those ages 5-9. The movie lacked any kind of depth, and it's the kind of film that makes you wonder if the screenwriters even picked up the novel.Julie Andrews was good as the airy-fairy You Will Prevail grandmother, but the grandmother in the book (known not-so-affectionately as Grandmere) was--for lack of a better word--a complete bitch. The romance that Mia's mother had with her algebra teacher Mr. Gianini in the book was cut down to a single date with Mia's debate teacher in the movie. And the biggest skewered plot point of all in the movie, Mia's father is dead, which is why Mia has to step up as princess. In the book, her father is very much ALIVE, but he can't bear children, so Mia (his illegitimate child) must reign.Let's just put it this way if you want a cheesy puff piece with little to no character development or plot, see the movie.

One day, her estranged grandmother (Andrews) comes to visit with a proposal for her  She would like Mia to be her successor and become Princess of Genovia.  Hilarity ensues because Mia is pretty much a regular teen who is clumsy, awkward and in desperate need of a professional makeover, so she spends the next several weeks in etiquette lessons, getting re-done and trying to decide if being a princess is what she really wants in life. The film was cute, at times extremely corny, but watcheable.  It featured surprisingly decent acting by Hathaway, who made up for the horrible Mandy Moore.  I especially enjoyed Hector Elizondo, a good character actor who was kind of hilarious doing his best Shaft impersonation as the Queen's head of security.  Heather Matarazzo who was also featured as Mia's best friend, continues in her quirky girl tradition, but still can't live up to her role in Welcome to the Dollhouse.

It was so predictably awful that I can't believe it did even relatively well in the box office.  My only surmise is that a lot of people thought it would be good and by the time they discovered it wasn't, it was too late to get a refund.The story had potential, but as usual it was taken to such extremes as to defeat the original purpose.  The melodrama and the predictable bad lines were so consistent that we actually started a betting pool to call what would happen next.  It was the only way to survive watching the film.If this is the sort of thing we allow our children to watch, it is no wonder they grow up with their minds made of mush.  There was absolutely no substance to this movie - nothing you could wrap your mind around and think about.  There are good movies out there aimed at teens, such as 'Ten things I hate about you' and 'She's all that'.  These movies center around fairly normal people with normal problems, mixed in with good lines and imaginative plot twists.  But this movie seems to say that your life will wind up perfect only if your grandmother happens to be a queen and you wind up being a princess.  The only thing you might improve by watching this movie is your ability to groan.

Well, after her wonderful part in Strike! - she was definitely even better than Kirsten Dunst or any other of the teenage casts there - I never saw any other movie of Heather Matarazzo. Now here she is back again, and I was surely happy about seeing her again !However, the movie itself failed completely.Well, no question, there was a good cast, good acting, very nice background. Especially, I liked Heathers part (closest friend of the princess) and the queen, and the funny house the princess lives in. Camera and directing itself wasn't bad, either. And about that Mandy Moore - she was just as evil and stupid as her character should have been, I don't know what else people expected from her.But the story itself was narrated in such an unbelievable boring and lifeless way ! The characters showed nearly no development and appeared lifeless in an unnatural degree. The storyline offered no surprise whatsoever and always took the most obvious way.Interesting smaller roles occur sometimes but offered no surprise either. For example, the neighbor of the princess, I always expected that something will happen with him, but he just stays a little weird, with no further characterization.Or the other pupils in school. They just stay the same throughout the whole movie ! Any REAL girl who would switch to such an attractive outfit would get masses of attention from boys. But again, the other pupils just stay lifeless around and treat her nearly as if nothing has really changed. That was so unnatural !Same with the princess. Her behavior was so damned predictable all the time.In short, the writer of the script absolutely had no clue about real people, and made most, if not all characters appear flat and super-stereotype. Many parts of the script also smelled like an old man's phantasy.There where still some nice little jokes in the script, for example when the princess should give an address to her school class, or how she damaged some statue. As such, the movie wasn't really pain to watch - but I didn't felt very well entertained either.Strike! was a masterpiece, I liked it even more than Matrix, but this one here is just plain boring.

It was the big screen breakthrough for Academy Award winner Anne Hathaway. And even if her character is the undisputed lead here, they still chose Julie Andrews (whose character really anybody could have played) as the first credit. Pretty ridiculous if you ask me, even if Hathaway was pretty much a nobody back then still. But lets talk a bit more about the contents of the film. It is a nice story from ugly duckling becoming a beautiful swan and even a princess later on. Of course, it was pretty difficult to make a stunning actress like Hathaway look bad in the first third of the movie. The first genre description here on IMDb is comedy and I think there are some funny moments, but overall I would really see it more as a family film, maybe even a romance movie. Sadly,t he romance part is as uncreative as predictable.Some good moments in terms of Hathaway's performance and in terms of the script also make this one work. Nonetheless I must say that the entire royalty story was not really necessary here. It did not add too much for me. Instead, I would have preferred maybe a film that would have run for 90 minutes only and been more of a high school comedy. The movie actually attempts too much and sometimes it seems a touch of try-hard in achieving genuinely funny comedy. And there are many occasions when they do not succeed. I would say Hathaway is almost too good of an actress (also back then already when she wasn't even 20) for the material here. This is a decent film, but not one that could not have been better on more than a handful occasions. A sequel was really not too justified. Finally, before I finish the review, I don't want to forget to mention Mandy Moore. I am a great fan of her and it is always nice to see her, especially her Stupid Cupid performance. This one may have been among the main reasons why she got cast in A Walk to Remember, one of my favorite films of all time and there she plays a completely different character to the vain spoiled school girl here. As a whole, I recommend The Princess Diaries, mostly for Anne Hathaway's star-making turn.

Julie Andrews steals the show (as always), and Anne Hathaway does a good job, except she seems too grown-up after the makeover bit to pass for a teenager. Mandy Moore is clearly destined to be a teenager living in California for the rest of her damn life (sorry, Mandy). The storyline flows in a reasonable manner Mia Thermopolis is a teenager living in San Francisco with her mother, who is an artist and has raised her with the financial help of her absent father. Her best friend is Lilly, and Lilly's older brother, Michael, serves as the token love interest. Mia's main concerns in life are the fact that she doesn't have breasts and she has a hopeless crush on Josh, a popular classmate who looks like he belongs at a country club rather than the beach. Mia finds out her dead father was actually a prince, she is the heir to the throne, and the entire plot consists of Mia trying to be a princess and having to decide if she actually wants to be royal or not, while dealing with the humiliation of her mother dating her teacher. Good, right?Except, if you've read the books, you realize that there is more to this story that should have been included, and that serious changes were made. In the books, Mia Thermopolis is a teenager living in New York with her critically acclaimed artist mother who specializes in still life. Mia's concerns are the environment, failing Algebra, and the fact that her mother is dating her Algebra teacher. Lilly Moscovitz is still her best friend, but her parents are psychoanalysts, and she is actually a lot meaner in the books than in the movie. Michael is actually a genius, as is Lilly. Mia's father is still alive, and is not a soft-spoken version of Billy Mays, but a bald, European prince who bribes Mia into attending princess lessons. Mia's grandmother is not Julia Andrews-esque, but is more akin to the likes of Cruella de Vil and Emily Gilmore. This woman has tattooed eyeliner, smokes like a chimney, and has an ugly dog named Rommel. Joe the chauffeur is now Lars the bodyguard, and Mia has more friends in the book than in the movie. The books offer a juicier story, more relatable and believable characters, and definitely is not a film that Disney would have wanted to make.The movie alone is okay, but compared to the books, it needs to be shelved in the let's not ever do that again of book-to-movie classification.

Not that it shines with wisdom or depth, but it's an easy, comfortable movie to watch, even if you're not into the whole royalty-kind stories. At some point, it kind of makes you dream about having an estranged grandma that comes with a throne, which, I guess, we can all relate to. It was nice to see Anne Hathaway again, but the true delight of the movie has to be Julie Andrews. The woman rocks! And the royal parts suit her best, she does have a regal attitude. A true Dame, indeed. So yes, I could watch this again and again, and still enjoy the princess's makeover like I did the first time.

To be certain, my friend and I had plans to see Rush Hour 2, and we couldn't understand why TPD was playing on more screens (fortunately, we managed to see RH2).Anyway, now that I've seen TPD, I'm going to offer a weird analysis of it. Probably the most confusing thing about is that Garry Marshall directed it. Who's he, you ask? The creator of Happy Days. Yes, the man who gave us the coolest greaser in history now gives us a story of a benevolent but awkward teenage girl who learns that she's actually the heir to a throne, and has to learn how to behave like a princess, with mixed results. Maybe the fact that Marshall gave these dissimilar pieces of work says something about the duality of humanity.This is the sort of movie that I usually only watch to heckle like the characters on Mystery Science Theater 3000 do to really crummy movies. I didn't heckle this one, however. I guess that since Anne Hathaway has done a number of more serious roles - Brokeback Mountain, The Devil Wears Prada, Rachel Getting Married - since then, it's much easier to accept her as more than just another pretty face (although I do find her quite attractive). The movie itself is totally predictable, so I still hold that Happy Days is Garry Marshall's best creation. As the Fonz would say I knew dat!

I personally don't care because if it's a good movie, then it's a good movie whatever the genre is. If there's one word to describe this movie, it's Ann Hathaway. All the movie's goodness owes to her. She's convincing as a princess, and she really is an interesting character in this movie. My eyes were pretty much glued to her all through the movie. Much like Julie Andrews attracted attention when she was younger in The Sound of Music, she carries the movie with her presence. Julie Andrews by the way also appears in a supporting role in this film.The movie definitely made Ann Hathaway a star. She's probably deserving, because she still has nice presence in a more recent movies like the Dark Knight Rising.In any case, this is a good movie, and is definitely worth the watch.

I admit that sometimes it does become a little trite and clich√© at times, what with the overdone stereotypes, but it keeps the viewer intrigued so it's not at all negative. It might even make you chuckle believe it or not! However this movie, like many other movies, is not for everyone; rather, this movie is better suited for tweens and teens. And when I say that, I am in NO WAY belittling it or putting it down, because to me 'Princess Diaries' is and always will be an enjoyable, funny, and at times childish film. (Not gonna lie--most guys will probably find no joy in watching it, but that fact does not a bad movie make.) I've seen this movie numerous times, and it seems I can never get tired of it. Cheesy?

In the movie, you can easily see how she progresses and builds confidence in her role. She delivered something entertaining to the audience, which is obviously great.Julie Andrews is brilliant as usual. We've seen her in titles such as The Sound of Music, Mary Poppins and even Shrek and it was wonderful to see her in this movie. She was the perfect choice for her role and I think she was the heart of the movie.As I have said, what makes this the perfect princess movie is the fun factor. This mainly focuses on the jokes, which is part of what delivers in the entertainment. There were some really funny ones such as Mia's reaction to her being a princess and the royal dinner with all the posh people. But also, this film has this light-hearted feel to it which is one of the reasons why I love it so much and one of the reasons why it makes me smile.Overall, this movie (I can't believe I'm saying this!) is by far the best Princess movie I have ever seen.

Though the film does belong to Julie Andrews as her grandmother, the wonderful actress who brought us classics such as Mary Poppins and Sound of Music. Hector Elizondo is also fun as Joe. The film has some lovely locations and costumes, and the two actresses are well supported by some very talented co-stars, such as the lady who played the bitchy Lana. The film also has a feel-good nature about it, that just adds to the film's appeal. However, the film isn't without its flaws. The story had an oft-tendency to become predictable, and the script while very funny on the most part, had some clich√©s here and there. There were some scenes that were a little, and that word I am putting a lot of emphasis on, slow and could have been developed a little more.

Unlike many people though, Hathway gets more. A LOT more when it is revealed to her that she is, in fact, a princess and needs to be educated in the ways of royal formalities before a very important upcoming event that will decide the fate of her, hitherto unknown, principality (or empire or kingdom or whatever the most appropriate word is).Helping, and sometimes hindering, her along the way are her grandmother (the current royal ruler, played with grace and wit by Julie Andrews), the main royal chauffeur/companion/butler (another great turn, this time from Hector Elizondo) and her schoolfriend, played by Heather Matarazzo. Then there are the dignitaries to be met, the people who end up fussing around the potential princess and those who just want their moment in the spotlight (including Mandy Moore, good here but even better in Saved! for those who are interested).It's a standard comedy of manners, awkward duckling trying to become graceful swan tale and yet it fills each scene with so many decent actors (Hathaway herself has great presence and is eminently likable, doing well alongside the veterans of the industry) and jogs along at such an agreeable pace that despite the familiarity of it all and the very Disney-ness of things it becomes more comforting than irritable.Despite my very male-ness, I couldn't help but enjoy this. It's perfectly crafted family entertainment.See this if you like Anne Hathway, My Fair Lady, Dave.

There's a real paucity in good acting from the high school support cast and the adults are recklessly awful as well. What did Sandra Oh think she was doing?Alas, Julie Andrews has played this one all wrong herself. All the straight bits come across perfectly well (an English accent = European aristocracy, no actual acting required) but the stylised/comic moments are foul.

Rebellious wallflower Mia eventually learned poise, sophistication and concern for others, though she risked forgetting  who her real friends were.  For a newcomer, I thought Anne Hathaway did quite well.  One example  in the 'Wonderful World of Disney' presentation of this movie on ABC, we were given a behind-the-scenes look at the movie.  It seems that one of Hathaway's many falls was unintentional, but she recovered quite nicely.  Her best performance came toward the end.  The physical comedy was good. Of course, learning how to be 'proper' and look attractive was one of the main themes, carried out quite well by all involved, especially the man who fixed Mia's hair.Julie Andrews did a magnificent job as the Queen, with her best work coming after a traffic accident.  She was proper and sophisticated but never completely out of touch with the needs of her granddaughter.  She, too, could be 'cool'.Hector Elizondo also did a great job as the chauffeur.  He could have easily played the King, if there had been one, but he made the most of his role, coming across as quite intelligent and caring.At times, though, this movie got off track.  I didn't particularly care for Lilly, but that didn't necessarily mean a bad performance from Heather Matarazzo.  Perhaps I disliked her because she was so good.  I'm going to say that the movie might have been just fluff without introducing some of the other plot twists.  Then again, those very plot twists might have added to the impression of fluff.There was one curse word in two hours (including breaks).  Anything else that could have come close to being off-color stayed within the bounds of decency, though one gag just barely did (no pun intended; see below after spoiler warning).I didn't care for a lot of the music, but then I'm not in the movie's target audience.  One song I did like was played when Mia would fantasize about kissing.It wasn't the best Disney movie ever, but I was pretty happy.COULD BE A SPOILER A possible red flag  a prank by Mia's so-called friends when she was changing clothes.

Mia (Anne Hathaway), a young teenage girl discovers she is a princess and has to decide whether or not to accept the throne. She attends princess classes under the tutelage of her grandmother (Julie Andrews), as well dealing with a plethora of normal teenage problems. However, the screenplay is poorly developed and does not invest enough on the changes that take place inside Mia. While things like posture and presentation are important assets, Mia's inner journey should be even more important. Anne Hathway manages to make us care about her final decision, particularly in the final third of the film. Julie Andrews as her grandmother, the queen, is a delight - absolutely charming and graceful, with a fine grasp on the responsibility she has as a royal and the lessons she learns about becoming a grandmother. Perhaps the relationship between the queen and the character Joe could have been developed more; there are a few hints that never really come to fruition.The other thing that lets this film down are the production values, which seem little better than TV quality. Indeed, the whole outing feels more like a television pilot episode or a television movie from one of those 1980s and 1990s Disney offerings like NOT QUITE HUMAN or A BRAND NEW LIFE. Tweenagers will probably enjoy this one a lot.It's a pity, as this film has the potential to be everything it claims to be 'hilarious, hip and heartwarming'. Especially as the people involved have a lot to offer. But on this project, they don't quite manage to pull it off.

The only thing from the books I think is most of the names and the fact Mia is a Princess.  However, putting the book aside, just as a movie it's one of those to watch when your feeling depression/having a sleepover/are ill.  It's a comfort movie (kinda like comfort food).Anne Hathaway was brilliant but the way she portrayed Mia (and the way she looked) was not quite how I imagined.  I have never been a fan of Julie Andrews but even I think this was one of her weaker roles.  She didn't shine.Basically it's watchable but very annoying if you've read the books.

The other people who didn't like couldn't even use correct grammar and punctuation. The latter are often who complain about (gasp) morals like prude people complain about S&V. Its really funny when a person uses words like sucks or even stronger words and expects to be taken seriously. Profanity and idiotic slang don't make you sound any cooler, just very immature.Getting back to the subject, when I go to a movie I only concentrate on the story and try and get caught up in it. I was entertained and didn't get bored. So overall I thought it was a cute, funny, movie. Actually the reactions of a few of the characters were quite realistic. I read one comment that said any teenage girl would be ecstatic if she found out she was a princess. I am around the main characters age and I know if I found out I was a princess I would be scared stiff and horrified. Also, many of my friends would not want to have a make over even if they did have frizzy hair and groucho eyebrows and would be angry if their best friend had it done. Of course many other girls would act completely different from the characters, but it really depends on the individual. I can't help but wonder if a few of the reviews on this website were written by childless 30 something year old males who think they know exactly how a 15 year old girl would act. Or else by normal parents with normal kids who are good looking, trend following, and non-geeky. A lot of commenters only went to this movie to hate it. They're long time anti-disneys who love writing bad reviews. They look for every single flaw imaginable. But really, you don't go to a movie to nitpick, you go to a movie to sit back, relax, get caught up in a story, and (in this case)have fun. This still won't be every person's cup of tea, and its definitely not the pervy comedy that most movies are now a day, but that doesn't mean you have to loathe it. Just don't watch the movie again.

With the excellent Julie Andrews playing the Queen of a made-up country in Genovia, and a decent supporting cast, 'The Princess Diaries' becomes a decent entertaining Disney flick. It still retains the fantasy-like aspect (though politically correct) of a glorious kingdom within a foreign land to the U.S. without singling and misrepresenting the people of a real nation. Anyway, I don't really take the Genovia aspect too seriously as this is story involving a far-fetched fantasy about growing up by becoming a Princess of a distant land! Who cares if the writers make up a country? Hector Elizondo (Pretty Woman) plays Joe, the Queen's bodyguard and mentor to Mia and as usual he's always likeable in that department. Mandy Moore was decent as the nemesis, and Heather Matarazzo (Scream 2) was funny as the supportive friend. Worth checking 'The Princess Diaries' out, and don't take it too seriously.

But it is a great role model for children, showing them that the popular thing isn't always the way to go.  Mia's encounters with Josh and the cheerleaders is a perfect example of why popularity is not always cool.As for the plot, its decent, but could use a little flavoring.  It's kind of corny that she is a princess (the title is probably the most corny part of the movie), but the story flows along smoothly.  The comedy is great and the irony is remarkable.  I enjoyed the constant predicaments Mia had to work her way out of (or into), including the press.The actors are all good, and I was impressed by Anne Hathaway.

She looked so beautiful, and so elegant, and it thrilled me to just see her, healthy and happy on the screen once more. The main thing to keep in mind with this film is that it is a Disney movie for kids. It's not supposed to be a mature adult comedy, so don't expect it.

It's pretty much typical Disney -- why does the word hijinks come to mind whenever I think of this kind of movie?  The story, with its parallels to Pygmalion (and hence My Fair Lady) and Pretty Woman, was predictable, but I suppose I was in the mood for predictable because that didn't bother me.  It seemed like half the supporting cast of Pretty Woman was in it; I noticed Hector Elizondo, of course, and the man who played Mr. Hollister as the (rather odd) beautician, as well as Dennis the elevator operator as the neighbor, and even the man from the French restaurant with a repeat of his it happens all the time line.One endearing thing about this particular homely-girl-becomes-attractive script was the way Mia (played quite well by newcomer Anne Hathaway) would lapse back into her pre-princess-lesson self under pressure.  Well-done.  However, I would *love* to see a movie where the homely girl stayed homely and people learned to like her anyway.  Or even one where you couldn't tell from the homely girl's first scene that it had taken a great deal of work to make the beautiful actress look homely.  I have never liked the two-faced Hollywood treatment of looks -- they give lip service to the fact that it's a person's self who matters, and not his/her appearance, but everything from Beauty and the Beast to She's All That has as a pivotal moment the transformation from ugh to wow. All in all, this is a good movie if you enjoy the likes of The Parent Trap and its remake.  By the way, if you've read the book, you'll want to forget that while you watch the movie, or you'll spend the whole time being bothered by the MANY changes.

Garry Marshall directed Princess Diaries. In an earlier time he brought us Pretty Woman, was involved with Laverne and Shirley,, and over the years has been involved in many, many high-profile films and TV shows, as a writer and/or director. His director's commentary on the DVD's bonus features is probably the best I've ever heard. He comes across as such a warm and caring individual, and he manages to imbue his films with that feel.Most critics gave fairly low ratings for Princess Diaries. However, for anyone who likes to be entertained this one does it. Some complained that it has mostly recycled ideas. So, what film doesn't? Anne Hathaway (same name as Will Shakespeare's wife) carries the story exceedingly well in her first role, even though she was a few years older than the 15-year-old Mia she plays. Mandy Moore demonstrates really good acting chops as the pretty and spoiled popular school cheerleader, a role totally different from her next film, Walk to Remember where she plays a spiritual girl with a fatal illness. And what else can be said about Julie Andrews, here just perfect as the Queen of Genovia, situated right between France and Spain!  -)The film has one, very simple message.  Maturity comes when we quit thinking about I, and start thinking about how we can use our talents to help others. That's Mia's challenge in this film. Mia has thick hair and eyebrows, is clumsy, gets sick when faced with talking before a group, and by her own admission, her biggest goal in life is to remain invisible. She was doing a pretty good job of that when her grandmother, the Queen showed up. Seems that Mia is the only blood heir of her recently deceased father, and she is the rightful future Queen of Genovia. The second half of the film deals with her new-found fame, flocks of reporters, her training to be more polished and graceful, attending a state dinner, and most importantly deciding whether she will accept the role as Princess of Genovia. Ready to formally reject it, still thinking of I, she reads a letter her father had written, and in the end she flies to Genovia to start her new life.The writing and directing make this a fun movie. Even though the theme has a serious note to it, the whole thing is presented in a very humorous manner. Much of it obviously tongue-in-cheek. The antics on the P.E. softball field. The neighbor Mr Robutussin. The evil-looking, hook-nose woman set to become Genovia Royalty if Mia rejects her title. The policeman and cable car engineer who end up at the final party, smiling over their honorary titles Knight of the Rose. In total, one of the more entertaining films we have seen recently. Garry Marshall's commentary selectable on the DVD is distinctly different from all the others I've heard. He nevers wanders way off the track, but stays with what we are watching. You can hear the big grin on his face as he tells how the filming was done, points out specific story-development shots, discusses the various actors and what films they have been in, why it was shot in S.F. rather than N.Y. (his grandchildren!), and interesting insights throughout the film. And YES, Anne (Mia) did accidently slip and fall on the wet bleachers, but it turned out very fitting for her character, and she was not seriously hurt. But, when she was rubbing her right hip while going back up the steps, she had a real reason to do so!!

There were actually some unexpectedly funny moments.     People have complained about the transformation of Mia.  Well, they could have done without the face makeover, I suppose, but that nest of hair had to go.  I can't believe her mother never took a hairbrush to her before she slid down the pole to go to school.  (They live in a converted firehouse...the mother was some kind of beatnik once.)   Julie Andrews is so cosy and reassuring as the Grandma, and keeps saying the word Genovia with such conviction and such a straight face that you want to believe it exists.  It was also cute to see the little romance going on between her and Joseph...a queen and a chauffeur!  There's hope for everyone.     Now I'll nitpick what was with the blond boy Mia had a crush on?  His face looked like melted plastic.  Every time he had a close-up I was startled, and lost track of the plot.  And why, oh why, is the dramatic final scene always done in the rain?  That has got to be the tiredest shtick ever trotted out in Hollywood.  Why do the writers think that the defining moment of a movie is more dramatic if the character making the speech is dripping wet?   But in the final analysis, I recommend this movie.

What results is a tough decision for someone in her position.The extremely awesome supporting cast includes Julie Andrews, Hector Elizondo, Hathaway, and Heather Mattarazzo. The comedy, while not drop dead hilarious, has it's kid friendly chuckle moments. The dialogue is completely devoid of any profanity, but, there are a few jokes that grown-ups will get.

Mia was cute and I can't see how this country was so regal that she couldn't be herself. I didn't mind too much when she became hot in a G-rated way (and she looked even more hot in the sequel, too).

The plot seems like it would be geared toward 11 and 13 year olds, but it's unfair to say it doesn't appeal to an older audience, I'm almost 19 and I enjoyed it, so did my sister AND my mother, in fact she's the one who convinced me to rent it. The acting isn't mind boggling but it isn't so bad where you're rolling your eyes at it. Julie Andrews was excellent though and she looks good for her age too. I think some parts were cliched and a bit predictable, but who cares? It was still a cute movie. I don't think anyone should write off this film just by it's appearance, like I did, cause you'll be pleasantly surprised.

Its a Pretty Woman story about finding the beauty within yourself...not just physical beauty, but the beauty of courage, appreciating yourself and doing things for the good of being good rather than the good of being popular. That being said, it is directed at children, because youngsters get very little of that kind of message today...sometimes I doubt if even parent send it. Society today doesn't often present anything to the younger generation other than eye-candy movies that insult their intelligence. This is not one of those. There have been those that look at this movie and see a dangerous message about having to be physically beautiful...perhaps that is a valid argument, but I don't think so, that is the argument of the hypochondriac of the movie world...this movie is a harmless touching comedy with a good message underneath for anyone who cares to notice  "},{"Title":"Wanted to see it again and again","Date":"17 March 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Romance","Review":"  I saw it with my family, which is the right thing to do since this is a family film.

Perfect for the would-be royal in all of us, the film is suitable for the whole family.  Julie Andrews shines as the queen in a modern day Pygmalion story.  She mentors her granddaughter from the clumsy, shy teenager into a sophisticated young lady capable of expressing herself.  Based loosely on the Meg Cabot books, the film's setting in San Francisco leads to beautiful scenery and some great fun at the expense of those pesky hills.  The cast does a great job, despite being largely young, lending a fresh, light atmosphere to the time honored story.   It is definitely a feel-good movie that kept our whole family laughing.  Highly recommended for the romantic at heart.

Not all of what comes out on the Disney label is appropriate for the under-14 set.  So with just a touch of skepticism, I asked around about it after hearing a good review from another source and I was surprised to find everyone liked it well enough to recommend it.  So I took my daughter on a date to her very first movie, complete with popcorn, Coke and candy.  And I only had to take out a modest bank loan to cover the concession costs.  But I digress...The Princess Diaries is a movie that everyone over 5 can enjoy.  Remarks that explode the left coast's loss of touch with reality may sail over kids--and some adults'--heads (i.e. a high school PA system asks, Would the Feng Shui club please stop moving the tables on the lawn?).  As with Garry Marshall's other recent film, Runaway Bride, Hector Alizondo comes away with some of the best lines and certainly the best delivery.  Julie Andrews pulls of the role of Queen nicely, although the emotional separation she feels is a bit underplayed.  The kids can really relate to Mia, who comes off as, well...a princess.  A happy ending seals the deal.  Others have said the acting is mediocre, but what can you expect from a mouse?  I stand up and applaud this movie, if only because it provided a wonderful date for me and my baby girl.

Forget the critics and academy who phonily nominate  artsy, serious films like shakespeare in love, english patient's wife or this years's beuatiful mind year in year out for academy awards, this is the best I've seen in a longtime. The very very best! Anne Hathaway, a relative newcommer who had one brief tv series, sparkles and radiates and does everything else a princess does in the starring role of a nerdish girl who learns she's princess of a far off mythical country named Genovia. Julie Andrews shows why she is a dame , perfect, sassy and fittingly sophiscated every step of the way. Even Hector Elizondo gliters through his relatively small role as the bodyguard/chauffeur for said Genovian royalty. I believe Elizondo's young daughter also has a brief, cutesy cameo as a Genovian royal subject. Heather Matarazzo, from the well received bizarre Welcome To The Dollhouse about a prepubscent trying to fit in at home, school and the love business, is the quiessential best friend portrayer, the daffy, delightful, witty Lily. Mandy Moore shows her ability to handle acting well in her first filmed acting performance as the bitter, jealous, conniving Lana. Lastly the woman who plays Mia's ( Anne's) mom is fine too as a would be bohemian artist/sixties holdover. All in all the film is so well paced and easy going, likely mostly owed to the genius of producer/director gary Marshall who according to the dvd featurette comes across as so well liked. To me Marshall is as much the genius as is Coppola, Speilberg or Altman. The story also is fast, free flowing and fun- and funny, often funny. Lots of amazing slap stick andd gags exist here in tihs movie and Anne Hathaway in particualr is so god naturedly a natural at pratfalls.

An Icon who helped make Walt Disney Pictures something more than a bastion for animated specials (not that these haven't been wonderful, consistently avant-garde, and unforgetable), we have the Lady back once more in the role of a mentor -- and she does this so well -- this time not for a proper British household, nor for a large family on the brink of the impact of a world war, but this time for a young girl who simply dares to dream. And daring to dream is something we ALL need to do.Anne Hathaway is an outstanding find and I hope we see more of her; it took a lot to encapsulate essentially two personas for a newcomer. She was equally successful at both and the results are no less than noteworthy. The audience is kept entertained throughout the film, truly a feel-good adventure in a time when the world most needed one, and excellently supported by Hector Elizondo, Heather Matarazzo, Robert Schwartzman, and a surprise cameo by ... (go and see the film to find out !!!).Not since Victor Victoria has Julie Andrews thrilled audiences like this, and said film garnered her third ocsar nomination along with a basket-full of others (6 more). That was 19 very long years ago.Treat yourself to a fabulous performance by a Veteran and Living Legend, a thrilling newcomer, a wonderful story and chance to feel good. The film's only draw-back, although it was pulled into the humour effectively, was the dialect of the city in which the story takes place.  But don't let this stop you. Rating is 4 stars (on 5).

It was directed by Garry Marshall, who also directed the much-loved Pretty Woman, the film had a good cast, plot, some very funny moments and brings up one of the most original ideas for a film in ages. The movie also gets by without having any coarse language, violence or cheesy moments whatsoever. Okay, maybe some critics out there noticed the movie can be repetitive in places and some may find the story a little far-fetched, but I found this family comedy to be a delight. The movie stars Anne Hathaway as a nerdy girl at school who suddenly finds out she is princess of Genobia. This girl has curly hair, glasses and ugly shoes. So the transformation begins to turn this dork into a member of the royal family. And what a transformation it is! Anne Hathaway plays both sides of her role astoundingly and manages to bring up one of the most enjoyable performances by a young actor so far in the year. Julie Andrews is typically engaging, giving a really believable portrayal of a Queen whom must be someone who people look up to as well as trying to fit in grandmother-granddaughter time. The film's script is brilliantly original and has lots of great laughs, moments of intense family poignancy and each of the characters has something in them that we can all relate to. This movie has been labelled as `a chick flick' but I think, I hope, boys and men will find something in this movie that they can appreciate, and I hope everyone can find the time to see this movie because it is truly fun to watch, even if at times it can sort of repeat the meaning it has just brought up a few shots ago. The movie has some great costumes and very good makeup for Anne Hathaway and as a whole, the movie is just really likeable and enjoyable, and I could not of wished for a better Midday watch.

Julie Andrews decides that she is to be the one to educate the gawky teenager ( which is a hard act to follow especially as Julie has a perfect speaking voice and stands as straight as a die!).All in all of cause everything works out okay and everyone lives happily everafter.

For the parents, you have Julie Andrews and the many jokes that anyone will find funny. But most of all, this can be considered a movie for teenagers. Being sixteen myself, I am happy to say that I found the characters very easy to relate too. I found myself really feeling for Mia. And being a male teenager, I found the leading lady to be gorgeous.

Julie Andrews is, well, Julie Andrews. What a classy dame! She delivers everything you would expect, and more. Hector Elizondo is his usual solid self, teen singer Mandy Moore does a funny turn as the nasty queen of the in crowd, and there are strong supporting performances from Heather Matarazzo and others. But the surprise is probably Anne Hathaway, in only her second or third film, whose performance as the duckling-turned-swan is completely on the money.

Although some have said it gives mixed messages about person worth and value, it still manages to remain more positive than not. I think far too much emphasis is placed on the importance of films as social commentary and instruction.The first criteria are, as always, does it entertain. This fine film from Garry Marshall does just that. Anne Hathaway is wonderful in her role as the title character. I really enjoyed her all to short run in the TV series Get Real and I am glad to see she will continue to be around. With her obvious talent, charm and beauty she is an actress that should be around for a very long time. Julie Andrews added the perfect counterpoint to Hathaway's klutzy teenager. She is beautiful and elegant as always. Hector Elizondo did a great job with his character, with the just the right subtlety. The appearance of the singer Mandy Moore in a film probably aimed at young people is not a surprise, what was refreshing was the avoidance of the obvious type of role these performers get. She was cast as a heavy, Hathaway's nemesis and a cliche but all too true cliquish cheerleader.Anyone out looking for an enjoyable trip to the theater can't go too far wrong with this.

Why indeed, she was born to play a queen.  Her grace, elegance and charm gave the movie a sense of excellence that could not have been achieved otherwise.  Anne Hathaway, the talented 18 year old who plays Mia, walked the fine line between portraying the fairytale'ish princess and your everyday 16 year old teenager with exceptional skill.  Her clumsy screw ups and other social gaffes were charming and endearing.  And who could forget Hector Elizando?  It is his acting that gives the movie the touch of humanity that so perfectly complements everything else in the film.Indeed, this is a movie that everyone will enjoy.

This is a good one to see with the daughter, niece or little sister if you want to look like a cool dad, uncle, or older brother.

Heather Matarazzo, already mildly annoying, makes this character even more annoying.

The plot of this movie was interesting, and it was a little long, but overall pretty good. Girls age nine and under at the theater were going crazy for it.

Sometimes, a G rated film like the Princess Diaries comes along, and you wish just once, that those horrible kids you took to better G rated fare would quit begging to go and see this made-for-TV-movie hidden on a real reel.Too many times during this film I caught myself rolling my eyes and wishing I'd wake up in something as innocent and charming as Legally Blonde, a similar but superior chick flick.  Both stories are about outsider girls attempting to become insiders than enjoying their outsider-ness.  Well sort of.  See, Legally Blonde did have an actual point.  Sadly, the Princess Diaries either had no point, or was trying to say, even if you neglect those people closest to you, you will always get a second chance at being actual royalty.A lot of this movie seemed to be about how cool it is to be famous or have a famous friend.  A little of this movie seemed to be about how much responsibility being famous is and how pretty much anyone can handle the job.Allow me to point out some of the sadder inconsistencies for a moment. 1. Hector Elizondo (a Garry Marshall regular) plays the Genovian National Security Adviser to the Queen/lovable limo driver to the new princess. 2. No matter how famous you are, self serving people will first try to climb on your bandwagon, then for some reason try to destroy you, and once destroyed, they will try to destroy you again. 3. Even the meanest of cheerleaders never see you coming at their pearly white cheerleader uniform with a chocolate ice cream cone. 4. Celebrity can solve all of your problems, even slamming into a San Francisco trolly full of people. 5. Girls always dump on the guy they eventually fall in love with because the guy they hung out with instead of the nice guy was actually a real jerk. 6. Every hairdresser has an entourage, is available at a moment's notice, is flamboyant, and always brandishes their hairdressing equipment like they were guns in a John Woo movie. 7. The prettier of the outcast friends will always be the one you are so charmed by.  She gets the guy.  The other one gets to still be her friend. 8. Somehow, you can pay for a pizza before it arrives, and have the pizza have a note written in M&M's even when you are racing against the clock to make it to a royal ball.Needless to say, this movie falls flat early, and never re-inflates.  The ending is a real DUH ending.  Take your stupid friends kids to see it or something like that.  And I was appalled to learn that something as haphazard as this story was actually a whole book.  I'd call it a cliche, but I don't even get what was going on, ever.  It was that bad.

The whole thing played like a bad 80s film, only without the kitsch factor. Avoid this film like the plague.

I love Julie Andrews and Anne Hathaway, so it seemed like just a fun little movie that I could watch before I fell asleep. I have to say that The Princess Diaries is a modern day fairy tale and that it is absolutely charming. It had cute laughs and is perfect for a teen audience, I could see some adults enjoying it as well. The actors were wonderful and the plot was reasonably good.Mia is an average girl in San Fransico, her goal in life though is to remain invisible by keeping her frizzy hair, bushy eyebrows, and clumsiness to push everyone away. She has a couple of friends, Lily and Michael, who genuinely care about her and her mom. But one day her long lost grandmother, Clarisse Renaldi, who is the queen of Genovia comes to tell her that she is the princess and must learn how to behave like one to rule the country. Mia takes the lessons and decides that she will find out if she wants it or not. But there comes a price when the school finds out and starts to love HER publicity a little too much.The Princess Diaries was very cute, my only problem was that it was extremely stereotypical and at times a bit too predictable. But seeing where this movie was aimed at, I'd say it did a job well done. Julie and Anne had great chemistry, they are such wonderful actresses that they really made this film enjoyable. This was a cute film, I would recommend it to others for an afternoon watch. It's just a harmless film that I'm sure anyone could be touched by, even if the ending was extremely cheesy.6/10 "}{"Title":"Royally Lousy","Date":"8 July 2006","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Romance","Review":" I knew this movie wasn't going to be spectacular, but it was even worse than I thought it would be. It had the potential of being a really funny fish-out-of-water movie, but instead it is very bland and contains both shoddy directing and editing. It didn't really feel like there was that much of a stretch from the protagonist being a nerdy student and then being a princess. So basically what we're watching is not a movie - but just an extremely long and drawn out makeover movie. It's very predictable - even for a predictable movie. And Julie Andrews, as the queen, can't seem to figure out whether to overact or underact. I mean for God's sake, she talks to the main character in an office, not even from a throne. Whoever made these weird decisions really dropped the ball. Even if you have very low expectations for this movie, which I had, you still will be disappointed.

'The Princess Diaries' is a film about a socially-awkward teenage girl who learns how to act like a proper lady in order to take on her title as princess. This film is definitely targeted at young girls, and it has plenty of comedy and charm to keep entertained. The film teaches girls that, deep inside, a princess is waiting to come out, and every girl has the opportunity to become a princess and become beautiful, even if she is socially-awkward and clumsy. The film has little to be desired, and it is just one of those films with little substance but some comedy and a storyline aimed at young girls (and older ones too).

It is the lowest value creation ever to come out of Hollywood. There was not one redeeming quality. Oh, sure the casting is not without its charm. Everyone will pay to see Julie Andrews, and Anne Hathaway is proving to have some nice talent - just watched Nicholas Nickleby tonight and quite enjoyed her in that one. But the cast can in no way make up for the horrible experience of watching this disaster. I am seriously disappointed in every member of the cast and crew for allowing themselves to be a part of such a disservice to mankind. The ill-conceived plot hangs together by a thread. The story displays absolutely no evidence of research or intelligent insight into either the factual or the fantastic. Not only is the story bad, it is poorly told. There are no thrills, suspence or even concern stirred in the audience about the fate of the characters, nor is there any hint of humour. I would have enjoyed it more if some Rambo-like character had burst in at the end and killed everyone. The film has nothing to offer but a mediocre moral - I believe that if you watch this film, you will get the same value out of it as you will from reading the following lineNice people can make people smile and clap, especially if they get a makeover.There, now you can save your money. And I'm not exagerating or joking in any way; it really is that far away from having any substance or entertainment value.If you want to see something of about the same genre and quality with significantly more entertainment value (this REALLY isn't saying much) watch Fran Drescher in The Beautician and the Beast. If you don't like it (I really had to force a positive attitude to find some amusement) then you will HATE the Princess Diaries. HATE.I would give this negative stars if possible.

Is it just me or have I seen this movie not once, not twice, but at least a thousand times in my mere 16 years of life?This giant mistake of a film revolves around the film's protagonist, Mia Thermapolis (Anne Hathaway) whose entire existence depends on remaining invisible. With an exception of almost vomiting on an audience full of not so innocent spectators one can say that she's going a bang up job of it. That is until her long lost grandmother (Julie Andrews) pops up and reveals that Mia's father was the prince of a the nonexistent country of Genovia. For the simple purpose of there being a movie, Mia's father completely ignored the necessity of procreation to secure the family blood line and only had one daughter. And this makes Mia.get ready.princess of Genovia!It turns out that her mother knew all along (how could she not), and thus Mia has a chance to throw a hissy fit. As you know, no movie of this caliber is complete without at least one of those. Ms. Thermapolis and Mia's father divorced when Mia was very young, and her mother thought it would be in her best interests to lead a normal life. You know, one where she lives in a firehouse, slides down a pole to get to the first floor, and occasionally throws darts at large boards covered in balloons filled with paint.Mia's not too keen on being a princess, but she and her mother decide that Mia will test out the waters before she makes any major decisions. In turn, Mia finds herself taking lessons in princess etiquette, and finally getting some of that good old movie makeover magic that's the basis for the rest of the film. Enter the stereotypically flamboyant man to do the job. After gasping at just how bad Mia supposedly looks, he straightens her curly hair, ditches her glasses for contacts, tweezes her eyebrows into arched oblivion, and smothers her in makeup. In the end she doesn't look any prettier, just a lot less distinct.The rest of the movie is just cotton candy flavored filler whose sole purpose is to make up the remaining 90 minutes of the film. Mia falls out of her chair. Mia can't put on pantyhose. The chauffer who seems to do everything except drive the limo gives Mia pep talk after pep talk Lana (Mandy Moore) terrorized the quiet kid with the oddly colored hair and Mia sticks up for him by dropping ice cream on her cheerleading uniform because as you know, all problems in Disney movies can be solved with a food fight.Will Mia end up with the blonde, boy hand pinup (Erik Von Detten) that everyone but she can see through from the beginning of the movie? Or will she end up with the nice older brother (Robert Schwartzman) of her best friend Lily (Heather Matarazzo) whose attraction to her is made painfully obvious? Will the popular kids all of the sudden want to become her best friends only to stab her in the back, while her true friends rein supreme? Will Mia accept the crown at the end of the movie? If you don't know the answers to these questions before you even start watching the movie you were either born and are currently living under a very large rock, or one of the people who keep writing screenplays for movies like The Princess Diaries in hopes of enticing preadolescent girls across the globe.Each character's actions are as hackneyed and predictable as the movie being viewed by the unsuspecting public. This fact alone may be the reason why not actor in this movie really shined, though potential is definitely evident. Anne Hathaway is cute and giddy without crossing the Meg Ryan line. I would have liked to see her make her on screen debut in a movie that doesn't involve her having to run into things and fall down for laughs. Julie Andrews unfortunately doesn't fair as well. I half expected her to burst into song or spin around on a hill like an escaped mental patient. At least it would have given her character some life.Mandy Moore also makes her feature film debut playing the token nemesis of any hard working, ridiculed teenage girl; the not-so-nice cheerleader with the jock boyfriend, entourage of followers who want to be just like her, and no motive in sight. And no surprise to us, there's a little cheesy singing performance on the beach thrown in for no reason other than no singer/actress can be in a movie without showing off her pipes.On the plus side there is a nice message about the meaning of true friendship and the rewards of remaining true to yourself. It will sit very well with the demographic audience of 12 and under. That audience will most likely enjoy The Princess Diaries. Too bad I can't say the same thing for myself.With a G rating and the word princess in the title, I have to ask myself, what was I really expecting?

Anne Hathaway plays Mia, and of course, Julie Andrews, do the best they can. They are troopers with a so-so script that really keeps its focus on the teen trauma, that IS adolescence. Unfortunately, adults will become rather distracted and start counting the lonely minutes, as the film wears on. The script tends to really drag, laden with the usual provisos that require more than a few dull-witted adults, hip kids, et al. Worse yet, the script aims at the adolescent thought zone and stay there, making it way too cute to suspend a gram of belief. Throw in the fact grandma is the head of state of a country, and knowing her name and being totally oblivious to this fact, is a serious stretch.Julie Andrews comes as close to anyone, to being the antagonist of the film. I'm sorry, but the mere thought of Julie Andrews being nasty or even rude to anyone, could bring down the republic. She is a goddess of musical entertainment, and we would still worship her anyway. The real standout of this pic is Hector Elizondo, who is believable, likeable and charismatic, as Joe. The scenes between him and Julie are some of the best. THE PRINCESS DIARIES is not one of the best, but it's not the worst, by far. Just don't expect any of the usual nod and wink moments of adult humor, that keeps those over twenty on their toes.

Even in scenes that were clearly terrible, she shone through. I laughed at jokes that were quite bad. Her character's growth was nothing but cliches, but she convinced me. Also of note is the excellent supporting cast Hector Elizondo especially, but also Heather Matarazzo, so great in Welcome to the Dollhouse, and Sandra Oh, who was great in Don McKellar's film Last Night.

In the spirit of films like She's All That we're introduced to a supposedly nerdy female character who looks very attractive in the first place, yet everyone looks at her like she's an ogre. Only She's All That had a good deal of humor and charm to make up for it. This movie is fueled solely by obvious plot points.Anne Hathaway, though extremely beautiful, is phony in her performance. She never convinces us that she is in fact this nebbish fifteen-year-old girl and her performance is way over-the-top.  It's nice to see Julie Andrews grace the screen after all these years.  That was a treat.  Though she has to work with a low-level script, she holds her own and keeps the charm on full blast.  She's just as great as she was in The Sound of Music and Mary Poppins.  Hector Elizondo (a Garry Marshall regular) also gives us another impressive performance.  He's another one of the film's saving graces.  He says a funny one-liner--the one subtle homosexual reference in the film  (holding a box of high-heel women's shoes) Shopping in San Francisco, the salesperson asked if I want them wrapped or do I want to wear them out of the store?  Also to help spice things up is the great Larry Miller, who steals the show in practically every supporting role he's in. He plays a flambouyant Italian fashion expert, who gives Mia (Hathaway) the big makeover.The plot has everything we've seen in the past teen-bopper flicks, only sanitized and more dumbed-down in a G-rated fashion.  We have Hathaway as the nerd, Heather Matarazzo as the nerdy best friend, the popular girl in the school/cheerleader (Mandy Moore) who is hot and looks down upon every other girl because she's so hot and all the fellow students view her as a goddess (yet everyone in the audience hates her guts--isn't that ironic?), we have the hot Backstreet Boys wannabe who also happens to be as subtle as a fire hydrant--not to mention a complete jerk--yet the main character has a huge crush on him and we have Matarazzo's brother as the guy who's always had the hots for Mia and also happens to be a complete outcast--despite the fact that he's also dashingly handsome.  I would go into the whole plot, but after I just introduced you to all the cardboard characters, you probably would've guessed the whole darn thing by now.The Princess Diaries is somewhat of a guilty pleasure.  Despite its outburst of cliches, it's a pleasant and happy journey.  And quite frankly this could've been as nauseating as an amateurish teen comedy like All I Wanna Do if it wasn't handled by Garry Marshall.  OK, this is not strictly a teen comedy, but most of the action revolves around teens.  Marshall was desperate to direct a movie that his children can enjoy, since Pretty Woman and Runaway Bride aren't films designated for the twelve and under crowd.  So if Marshall's raw ambition wasn't put into this work, I perfectly understand.  If you have young children, they'll love this movie!  They'll eat it up with a spoon!  And though I enjoyed it to a degree and you can--in some aspects--say it's fitfully entertaining, but older audiences still won't find PD ultimately satisfying.  As I said, I've seen Shrek and Osmosis Jones, and to tell you the truth I think adults will enjoy those movies MORE than children, though that is the target audience.  So I don't want to hear any crappy responses like, Hey!  It's a kid's movie!  What do you expect?  Go see the two movies I just mentioned.  THAT'S what I expect! Family comedy doesn't entirely translate to  Lower your standards.My score  5 (out of 10)      "},{"Title":"Julia Roberts &#150; Your Clone is Ready...","Date":"13 August 2001","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Romance","Review":"  The ongoing debate over human cloning was apparently settled some 20 years ago, at least in Hollywood.

Besides Hathaway's remarkable resemblance to Roberts, her on screen personna is a virtual copy, though Hathaway gives it a fresh take and is, if possible, more winsome and winning than Roberts.  Hathaway has a real future, should she pursue it, at the very time Roberts career will likely take a different turn.Garry Marshall's `The Princess Diaries' is, in many ways, a G-Rated remake of `Pretty Woman;' though it's `fish out of water' theme is universal.  An adorable cast, headed by Hathaway, Julie Andrews and Hector Elizondo gives this movie the perfect combination of  charm, humor and romance.  This is the perfect movie for the whole family.  Preteens will enjoy the physical humor; adolescents the attractive young people discreetly on display and a story to which they can personally relate; adults the wry, suggestive, but not smutty dialogue and the elderly the return to romance among both `young' and `old.'There's nothing offensive in `The Princess Diaries' and much to recommend it.

I didn't fall asleep mind you (due to the numerous little girls in the audience laughing almost every 2 minutes) but I wasn't far from doing so. This is an okay movie, it was obviously not meant to be an Oscar winner, but it's nothing very fresh either. Julie Andrews does what she can as a queen who has come to talk to her grand-daughter Mia (Anne Hathaway, in her first role) about taking over the thrown as princess of a small European country. Mia is, of course, shocked but eventually does agree to take princess lessons and then the predictability really comes full circle. The jokes and laughs can be seen coming from at least five miles away and the outcome is so obvious it seems that no real effort was made at anything but a predictable one.Again, this is an okay movie (and that's being generous in my opinion) that should please little girls and maybe teens, but young adults (like me) and adults will likely be checking their watches or lulling off into a slumber.I give it ** out of 4 stars.

The film is piffle, but it does have some drive for the first hour.

"},{"Title":"Nicely Cast, Dismally Written","Date":"21 February 2005","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Romance","Review":" This movie has a few saving graces - namely, its cast. Anne Hathaway, Robert Carmine, Heather Matarazzo, and Larry Miller are wonderfully cast so as to bring to life the characters of the charming novel chronicles of Mia Thermapolis. It is near impossible to imagine anyone else in the roles of Mia, Michael and Lilly. However, other characters (most often ones invented for the movie to suit other Gary Marshall regulars), are not very well-cast. Julie Andrews is far too sweet for the horrific terror that is Grandmere in the books. Other attractive, but not necessarily talented, actors fill the parts of Mia's family, friends, and enemies, including the otherwise winning Hector Elizondo who doesn't suit the original role of Mia's Swedish bodyguard Lars at all.This movie, if aimed toward its original intended audience, and written extremely better, would have been a cult classic, if not an everlasting cinematic masterpiece. The novels by Meg Cabot are a perfect blend of comedy and near-tragedy, and, if properly adapted, would surely have an impact on its viewers. The characters in this movie are POORLY developed. Time and again, sacrifices are made to plot and character to set up for slapstick moments or otherwise clich√©d Disney bits. With all of these sacrifices, it's hard to find these moments the least bit endearing. The whole movie is but a splay of these various Disney bits. Unnescessary changes are made EVERYWHERE. Names are changed, the entire setting is flopped to the other side of the country, the antagonistic Grandmere is replaced with sweet grandma Clarisse, instead of rendering Mia's estranged father impotent he is killed off, Genovia is changed from sensible principality to inexplicable kingdom, and numerous names were ever so slightly altered for no apparent reason. Another issue that should be much more heavily touched upon is the ethnic cleansing of the casting. Originally, Albert Einstein HS was much more diverse. Indian characters Tina Hakim Baba and her boyfriend are not even supplanted in the film (robbing it of a touching arc in the story that displays Mia's sensitivity). Also removed is Shameeka, one of Mia's black friends. This really upsets me because these were all very good characters besides adding a healthy dose of ethnic variety. Also supplanted is Lilly's boyfriend, a Russian violinist, with magician Jeremiah. Makes you wonder if perhaps the original novel was a bit too racy for Disney, if you'll excuse the pun.If there had even BEEN a plot for this movie, I would have been satisfied. However, it seems as though there was not even a semblance of it. It is just a collage of exhibitions of Mia's clumsiness. Intelligent humor, dry humor, sarcasm and aspects of the liberal lifestyle of Mia and family of the novel are completely eradicated. This film robs the novel of its charm, and its only redeeming feature is, again, the casting of the lead characters (excluding Julie Andrews).Not only is this a dismal failure as an adaptation, its immature humor gives the film a feeble foundation - capitalizing on slapstick and the makeover turning point for Mia, it is hardly anything new, and only Anne Hathaway and company make this film truly worthwhile. It is my hope that this film will someday be revisited by a screenwriter who would remain truer to the witty and fun novels that it claims to be based on. It would be a shame that such a film mightn't have Robert Carmine, Anne Hathaway, and Heather Matarazzo in it.

On one fine day however she get's to hear that she's really a princess and the future queen of a small kingdom somewhere between France and Spain. Normally that little country would be called Andorra, but that's not really a cool name, is it? So why not change it to Genovia? Who would notice? Certainly not the Americans, they don't know anything about Europe, so why would they know anything about a small country in Europe? Of course her head starts to spin as she is getting prepared to become a real princess. She almost forgets her friends. She no longer cares about the boy that loves her anymore and tries to get a prettier boyfriend. But of course in the end she realizes that what she is doing is all wrong and she becomes some kind of modern version of a fairy tale princess...This movie is just childish, very unbelievable and full of stereotypes. I guess it is perfect for teenage girls who dream about becoming a princess and need this kind of modern fairy tales to escape the hard reality that life is... The only problem is that I'm not a teenage girl, I can see past all that sugar sweet nonsense. Even though I didn't really like the movie, I have to admit that it had some good things too.

Many people have submitted such comments as It wasn't as cheesy as I expected or It was much better than I thought. Another prevailing opinion is that the casting of the movie, and the chosen director, were great. On all of these points I most heartily agree on.Now, the negatives. The strongest opposition to the movie is that it is totally unfaithful to the series by Meg Cabot. Personally, I have never read the series. BUT! Before you sigh and turn away, read the next sentence I HAVE skimmed through the first book, (in my case, skim means reading it in a complete random order, although by the end I did manage to read most of the book) so I AM aware of the father's inability to...uh...reproduce, Lily's original Russian boyfriend (who played the violin, I believe?), the grandmother's not-so-pleasant personality, etc.None of which are portrayed in the movie. Which is a great disappointment to those who are die-hard fans of the series.But. It's only common knowledge that novels remade into movies are always twisted and changed until it only resembles the original storyline. It's usually only the extremely popular or classic books, with worldwide recognition, such as The Da Vinci Code, the Harry Potter series, and The Secret Garden, that are saved from facing total transformation. And even then, most people that I'm acquainted with have confessed the novelized version is always the better.Yes, there are exceptions to what I'm saying. Of course there are. But hear me to the end.Disney, especially, has a tendency to turn everything into a children's fairy tale. Because the entire company is a company devoted to children. Its aim is not to portray a novel the way it is written, but to give a classic happy story to their fans. That is the contract it has forged with its audiences.Take the Disney classics, for example. Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Little Mermaid...they were all based off original fairy tales. But even they were changed completely in Disney's portrayals. Belle (Beauty and the Beast) originally had two jealous sisters. Aladdin had a mother and an evil uncle. Ariel (The Little Mermaid) turned into bubbles (died) in the end. None of these happened in the movies.But we (the Disney fans) love them. Not because we loved the original fairy tales and loved to see them on screen (if that's what you wanted, you would've watched the original French movie Beauty and the Beast), but because we fell in love with the movie itself, the characters the movie gave us, and the story the MOVIE told us.>>The Disney movies stand for themselves. I think that's their strong point. They don't have to rely on what novels or fairy tales they were originally based off of, but they stand as independent films, having EVOLVED from another novel or fairy tale.Everyone's watched Disney films. This should have been expected of the Princess Diaries, too. I'm sure Meg Cabot was aware of Disney's reputation--if she wanted her novel to be copied onto the screen, she would have chosen 20th Century Fox or Warner Bros. That's what J.K. Rowling did. I'M surprised so many people were shocked to find the movie was not like the novel.To be fair, I do admit that Disney HAS, on some occasion, been pretty true to the stories some of the films were based on. (Holes, for example, and Chronicles of Narnia.) But a storyline like Princess Diaries' couldn't go that way.>>I do think that out of all the movie companies, Disney was the best choice for this movie--the other companies may have been more faithful to the series, but only Disney would have made it a classic.And I am a personal fan of Julie Andrews and Anne Hathaway, and they pulled off a great combo in this film, I believe. I also enjoyed watching Mandy Moore in A Walk to Remember, so I had my eyes on her during this movie, too.Everyone's entitled to their opinions, definitely. So while I will never tell anyone off for hating this movie, I will also take the liberty to say that The Princess Diaries, while not Academy Award material, is definitely one of my favorite and heart-warming films.

While Mia struggles with the decision of staying in her life or starting anew as Princess of Genovia, her classmates struggle with the change and Clarisse tries to make Mia into princess material.Although this film is a predictable mix of Pygmalion and teen comedy, it is actually quite enjoyable if you are in the mood. The Disney logo and obvious soundtrack selection should tell you whether or not you are in the target audience or not (I wasn't), but if you can get into it this moves forward with a familiar charm mixed with some nicely comic touches. The storyline goes more or less the way you expect it to but it is still quite fun and I wasn't bored at any stage. The developments and character changes are a bit bland (the romantic threads particularly so) but things keep moving anyway. The look and sound of the film is derivative &#150; the direction isn't anything special and the choice of teeny pop is boring and a bit annoying.Anne Hathway is poor at first but gets a bit better as the film goes. Her geeky turn is strictly by the numbers although she is better as her character moves away from this end of the spectrum. Much better is the supporting adult cast. Andrews' is an obvious turn but she works well and makes for an enjoyable contrast with Hathaway. Likewise Elizondo is a nice addition and works with the material well. The others include Moore, Burbano, Oh and a few others but mostly the cast are just serviceable and do enough to carry the film along.Nothing special then but still enjoyable.

In addition, I thought that the performances were superior, the directing was excellent, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the casting was perfect. Also, when Mia (Anne Hathaway) got hazed, I felt really sorry for her. You poor thing. When she fell for Josh (Erik von Detten), I got all warm and tingly inside. In addition, when Lana (Mandy Moore) got coned, I felt really good. Kudos to Garry Marshall and everyone involved for a job well done. Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Julie Andrews or Anen Hathaway, or you enjoyed Meg Cabot's title novel, I highly recommend this movie. You're in for a feel good time, so see this movie today. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.

Anne Hathaway stars as an ugly duckling with self confidence difficulties, who supposedly is the heir to some imaginary country wedged between France and Spain I think. The Princess Diaries is full of stock, formulaic situations which are resolved in predictable fashion before the fadeout. The movie is saved by the charming presence of Anne Hathaway, Julie Andrews, and a host of good supporting actors. Andrews plays Queen Clarisse Renaldi of the imaginary Genovia. Her right hand man Joe is Hector Elizondo. Whenever the two of them are on screen, they lift the movie above the ordinary. Heather Matarazzo plays Hathaway's nerdy friend Lily Moscovitz. The interplay between the two is genuine enough for us to believe that they're really friends. Mandy Moore and Sandra Oh appear in the movie in small roles. Marshall sets up a number of situations in the movie, but then he fails to deliver. The scandal in the film is an absolute joke and really makes little logical sense. The film is routine in its execution and since it's rated G, it's really only for the tween set. ** of 4 stars.

The books are much better, with a deeper plot line, and the movie had very little of the original aspects, which upset me. Where was Tina? Where was Boris? They were all key characters in the book, and there's no reason they shouldn't have been carried off into the movie. But anyway.Anne Hathaway is a brilliant actress in any movie she does, except for the fact most of her movies are the same, but that's beside the point. She's perfect for the part. I also liked Heather Matarazzo as Lilly, and I'm glad they were both in the second movie. Julie Andrews was wonderful to, and it's nice to see that after all these years, she can still play a strong, and good character. A character and actor I didn't like though, was Jeremiah Hart, played by Patrick Flueger. If he was supposed to be a replacement for Boris, he was a very weak replacement. The character could have been a bit more similar to his equal in the books, and the acting could have been better.For a Disney movie, this is quite good, but in regards to linking to the book - it was done very very badly.

Plus I'm more than twice the age of the audience for this, and I'm not even a girl...Anyway, it was all about this American teenage girl who was a bit of a freak and looked kind of like Mike Myers in drag to boot, who found out from her grandmother Julie Andrews that she was actually the Princess of a European country called Genovia, so she got a makeover that turned her into an American Cat Deeley, started taking lessons in how to be a princess from the grandmother and her security chief/chauffeur (No bobbing of the head, please), and had to decide whether or not she was going to take the job. Go on, take a guess; I knew this was based on the first of a series of novels, so I could sort of guess how this was going to end (leave the door open for a sequel or a Disney Channel TV show?).But even though a lot of it was pretty obvious and stuff - was she going to throw over the guy who really liked her and chase the A-crowd hunk? - the main character was likeable and Anne Hathaway did a good job playing her, plus she had Julie Andrews and Hector Elizondo along. (I heard he's been in every movie from the director.) I liked Heather Matarazzo as her best friend and the guy who played her neighbour as well; some of the music was a bit too The Box-ish for me - the orchestral music was good though - and it did feel like a really long episode of The Wonderful World Of Disney, but it was sweet, funny and charming in the end. I liked it. 7/10.

Now, I don't as a general rule like Pygmalion stories, where a girl is taught to be completely different from who she is, that she is not worthy of being taken seriously unless she wears her hair a certain way or dresses a certain way.  While her mother and her (by the end of the movie of course) boyfriend both cared for her no matter what, no one else really did--including her grandmother.  Actually, the thing that really bugged me the most is that the director should have left in 2 of the deleted scenes available on the DVD version, one of her mother's date with the teacher and reaction to the new Mia, and one of Mia with what's-his-face-boyfriend-guy. The movie was discontinuous and incomplete without them.  Plus the acting was generally nothing special.

And of course, since Miss Andrews appears in The Princess Diaries, that came up, too.  My wife wanted me to go out and rent it, but I narrowly convinced her that we wouldn't have enough time to watch it.  I just let the subject drop, hoping she'd forget about it.  And then this cursed snowstorm hit.Anyway, back to this particular story.  We also rented Elmo in Grouchland for our 3-year-old daughter.  And after having seen both films in the same day, I can honestly say Elmo is the better picture.  And I fell asleep while watching it.Yes, sleep is definitely preferable to viewing The Princess Diaries.  The only thing that redeems this movie is the fact that Julie Andrews and Hector Elizondo are in it.

There are not enough funny moments and the ones that are there are not that funny after three seconds. It wants to be a fairytale movie yet it's not magical enough, what with all the stuff that's supposed to make the story seem more real. It just ain't gonna work this way. I was especially disappointed by the end. There is no dramatic twist--it is way too predictable.

Why did they change so much of the plot?  (i.e. in the book, the father is living and has maintained a distant, but loving relationship with Mia.  In fact, he is the one to tell her about her heritage.  This fact leads to one of the most hilarious diary entries in the book - dealing with Mia's embarrassment over her father's sterility and the reason for it.) Also, why the need to have Mandy Moore sing her silly little Stupid Cupid song?  Was it written in her contract that she was to have her little musical number, no matter how excrutiatingly embarrassing it was to watch her.  For a moment, I thought I was watching a Back To The Beach remke.  The diary entries in the book are very honest and realistic, in that a teenager would really feel and talk the way Mia does.  But in the movie, the clumsiness and embarrassing situations are completely overdone.  I couldn't tell if the actors were over-acting all their stereotypical roles, or if it was just a poorly-written script.  This disappointing version completely lacked the feel of the book - and I am usually quite forgiving of screen adaptations of my favourite books.
