Remake....","Date":"1 June 2003","Score":"18 out of 22 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" Every line is a hilarious pun or joke. Seems to be a remake of Talk of the Town (black and white movie, 1942), which was more of a drama than a comedy. Same plot of love triangle, based on help from an old flame, up against an adversary running for public office, who is trying to avoid bad press. The hero, wrongly accused, even uses the same hiding places throughout the flick. Yvonne Wilder steals the show as the house-keeper Aurora, who runs a tight ship amid all the confusion of the pack of dogs always running around; She speaks her mind yelling things under her breath. It isn't any Shakespeare, but its all around fun for all ages, and has a clever screenplay. Charles Grodin is the dour, serious husband who is trying to hold his position as Husband. The chemistry between Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn is amazing, and you can sense the conflict that the married Goldie Hawn feels as she tries to avoid falling back in love with Chevy Chase. Some great one-liners from Chevy Chase - he seems to be answering his own question half the time, and the jokes are for the benefit of the audience and Chevy himself.

The situations are so utterly outrageous, that they're hilarious. Seems Like Old Times is the story of a woman (Hawn) who's ex-husband, Nick,(Chase) is wrongly accused of robbing a bank. Nick keeps popping up at his ex-wife's house to get her to help him out, and in the meantime, she's trying to keep him hidden from her husband (Grodin), who's got an interest in aprehending Nick because he's up for the role of Attorney General. The story is very similar to Max Dugan Returns, another Simon comedy in which Marsha Mason plays a woman who's estranged father (Jason Robards) shows up at her doorstep one night with a suitcase full of stolen money. In need of a place to lay low from the cops, the woman has to hide him from her boyfriend, a detective played by Donald Sutherland. By the way, if you liked Seems Like Old Times, you'd probably enjoy Max Dugan Returns, although it is not filled with as much 'stupid comedy' as the former.Seems Like Old Times is classic Chevy Chase wit, Goldie Hawn charm, Charles Grodin panic, and comfortable Neil Simon comedy. Plus, it's got a load of other familliar faces like Robert Gillaum as Grodin's best friend and co-worker. T.K. Carter is hilarious as Goldie Hawn's chauffeur/maitre di/whatever else the woman hires him for (you'll understand if and when you have seen the movie). I think my favorite character of all, however, is the sassy housemaid, Aurora. It's a nice little film about outrageously odd occurences.

Then they were funny to me, but now that I get older, they seem even funnier. Maybe it's the nostalgia, in a day and age of 'dark comedy', to be again in an era that was more laid-back and lighthearted. These movies are just good plain fun. As far as Chevy Chase, and Goldie Hawn are concerned, especially in Foul Play...I would have describe them as cute, (especially together), great fun, fun to watch, great talents, and in this movie pure genius. I would love to see some of the seventies/ eighties comedy icons get together to make one last movie together.

Playwright Neil Simon, who scripted this film had a real grasp on his prose all through the 70s and 80s, and this film is a delight for everyone familiar with his style of lining up one-liners in such a way that the viewer barely has time to breathe from laughter. All three leads are great.

Foul Play is their first go-round, and Seems Like Old Times is equally as timeless and great.     For the over 1000 times I have watched Foul Play and Seems Like Old Times, I feel warm, giddy, and romantic every time as I look at this beautiful and funny pair.  However, in Seems Like Old Times, they are divorced.  Hawn is the pretty but confused lawyer divorced from klutzy, easygoing novelist Chase turned bank-robbing fugitive and currently married to prim D.A. Charles Grodin.  In fact, Hawn is so liberal she aids illegal aliens, a kleptomaniacal black chauffer, and faces the ultimate dilemma  Should she take in her ex-husband and come back and have fun with him or should she stay with her humorless current husband.  Both men love her.  Chase scoots under every bed due to intimidation by Grodin.  Grodin does everything to get rid of Chase.  Chase still has loving feelings for Hawn.  This causes Hawn titilation, even insomnia with Chase hiding out in their house.  When the two men finally meet, sparks fly.  Not only do they get into a fistfight during dinner, but a court case looms over.  Naturally, Grodin prosecutes Chase and Hawn defends him.  Hawn wins.  Chase kisses Hawn in front of an exasperated Grodin.  Then Hawn and Grodin go away.  They have car trouble, and Hawn unexpectedly gets to Chase's cabin in a rainstorm.  She smiles at him.  But that is the ending.     Still, despite some flaws, Seems Like Old Times is a timeless small movie for those who want to laugh and fall in love.  But why did it flop?  Was it hard to accept Hawn and Chase as divorced?  But the chemistry is still there, whether they get married or split up.  Sure there are several romantic screen teams, such as Hanks and Ryan, Powell and Loy, and Hepburn and Tracy, but it is Hawn and Chase who do it for me and, of course, they are not married to each other in real life, but are married in spirit on screen.

His mug is prominently featured in the robbery photos and then the fun ensues when he goes to his ex-wife's (Hawn's) house to engender her help after being let go by the robbers and being fully on the run from the law.The movie is mostly fast-paced slapstick farce, a host of retreaded clichés (the dogs, for example), and quick jokes. Charles Grodin is actually quite funny and charming as her straight-arrow District Attorney (soon to be Attorney General) husband, Ira. Given Midnight Run, I think Grodin should be considered a mint for American glib comedy a la Albert Brooks.It's pointless to go much deeper into the story as the plot merely drives slapstick scenes one into the next. The story is essentially the sum of its parts.Goldie Hawn is in full-tilt cutie mode (she really was a doll) but carries the movie very well as a hopeless do-gooder who wants to help everybody, including her ex-husband and every stray dog in 10 surrounding counties. Chevy Chase often gives the impression of making comedy look effortless (think Fletch), but he is REALLY giving into pratfalling a la his SNL days in this one. The supporting cast with Guillaume and others is excellent.This is completely worth a watch if you catch it as in many ways this movie is superior to the Hawn and Chase hit Foul Play.

The director is Jay Sandrich who previously helmed such classic sitcoms like The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Soap of which Guillaume and Gould are veterans of.

The thing that I thought was so funny is that Nick just casually walks in and tells the woman (who works at the bank) that he is robbing the bank. Unfortunately for Nick the hidden camera got a perfect picture of him. That picture is ironically sent to his ex-wife's husband (Ira Parks) who is to send Nick to jail. Glenda, Nicks ex-wife was the first person that Nick wen't to. On the way over to her house Nick got hungry and stops at a Vending Machine for some MILK DUDS. Nick was in and out of Glenda and Ira's house and it seemed like Ira would just miss his chance to catch Nick like when Nick was hiding under the bed that Ira and Glenda were on. One night (in the movie it was on a Tuesday night) the Governor of California came over for dinner at Glenda and Ira Parks house and guess who the chef was. Times up, it was Nick Gardenia. That's when Nick Gardenia and Ira Parks met face to face (they each got the chance to punch each other in the face). Soon after this everybody went to court and the verdict came up NICHOLES GARDENIA IS NOT GUILTY. (maybe next time Ira). I did not understand the ending of Seems Like Old Times. Ira and Glenda try to get away and get stranded at night in the rain. Glenda runs off to find help because Ira got injured. Glenda found Nick in a Cabin. When she smiled at Nick the movie ended instantly. It seemed like the movie had an incomplete ending to me because Ira was still injured in the car. I would have thought that Nick would have helped Glenda and Ira and then everyone would be happy (and that's when I think the movie should have ended). However I would rate this movie 10 out of 10 because it makes me laugh and I like the music in it (oldie ralaxing type). I recommend Seems Like Old Times to anyone! It is a great movie!!

The comedy today aims at the lowest common denominator - Woody Allen uses the term crass to describe them - and for someone of my generation, what passes as comedy today just isn't funny.

Being thrown from a moving car afterwards, a bruised Chevy makes his way to his ex-wife, Goldie, who, of course, is now married to the county d.a., played wonderfully by Charles Grodin.At first, it reminded of me The Talk of the Town, the one where Cary Grant is wanted by the law and Jean Arthur gives him shelter, unwillingly. Then, it felt like those Doris Day/Rock Hudson movies. Then, as it neared its wacky courtroom end, it felt like What's Up, Doc? which was a remake of Bringing Up Baby. With me throwing all these names at you, do you feel like watching an old movie? Well, this will do. The stars' chemistry and charm make for most of the appeal, and it is quite easy to take and pleasant with its presence of 80s stars George Grizzard, T.K. Carter, and Robert Guillaume (from Soap and Benson.) Having said that, it's not as good as Simon's greatest films, like The Odd Couple, The Sunshine Boys, and others. (I keep thinking though that 7 is too low and 8 is just a little high. As it won't take a 7.5, I'll give an '8' to give it the benefit of the doubt.) But it is much better than Foul Play, whose main asset besides Goldie was the very funny Dudley Moore.The viewer may be left wondering about the ending, though. It makes me feel like Neil Simon didn't quite know how to end it, for it stops very abruptly. But, if you're in the mood for some madcap shenanigans and haven't ever seen this, you're in for a treat. Seems Like Old Times makes for a good time, courtesy of Neil Simon.

Chase plays it dry and Hawn is a loose pin, but it's the crackling chemistry between them that really works wonders&#133; and the third party of Charles Grodin caps it off nicely. And not forgetting the ever reliable T.K Carter ('Southern Comfort', 'The Thing' and 'Runaway Train') who drops in with an amusing performance.Director Jay Sandrich is responsible for a lot TV shows and TV movies, but his crack at a feature length film displays bounce with the comical bravura and timing. The witty script (magnificently penned by Neil Simon) is well placed with its gags that it never out stays its welcome, but maybe it gets lost amongst its laconic talky spots. The eventual kayos that occurs is rather structured in its episodic layouts that come and go, but it's done in a wry style than intentional clumsiness even throwing some slapstick moments aside.A highly entertaining comedy enterprise by two stars who were at their peaks.

In that one the former was a police officer who is trying to protect the Pope on a visit to San Francisco, and the latter is an innocent by-stander who stumbles into the details of an assassination plot. The story worked with the assistance of Dudley Moore as a befuddled not-so-innocent third party who gets dragged into the proceedings by Hawn, Eugene Roche as a conspirator, Billy Barty as an accidental victim of Hawn's fears and hysteria, and Burgess Meredith and Rachel Roberts having an unexpected classic judo face off. Oh, all to the concluding music from Act I of Gilbert and Sullivan's THE MIKADO.SEEMS LIKE OLD TIMES is a remake of sorts of the 1942 film THE TALK OF THE TOWN. That film dealt with Cary Grant as a fugitive being hidden in a house by Jean Arthur, while jurist Ronald Colman (just nominated for the U.S. Supreme Court) is renting the same house from Arthur. Here Chase is the fugitive, hiding in the garage of his first wife Hawn, unbeknown-st to her second husband Charles Grodin (who is being considered for the post of Attorney General of California. The screenplay is by Neil Simon this time, and there is good supporting roles by Robert Guillaume, George Grizzard, and Harold Gould (as an increasingly annoyed local judge). However, TALK OF THE TOWN was dealing with a man accused of an arson murder due to his labor union activities. Grant was an activist in that film. Chase comes across as something of a schmuck here - he is forced at gunpoint to assist two men in a bank robbery, is set up to deliver the note to the teller, gets his face photographed too well by the bank's camera, and is then tossed out of the speeding car on a hillside by the two felons. The audience knows Chase is innocent, and gradually Hawn and Grondin and Guillaume realize it too. But it seems that Chase had a similar bad experience in Mexico regarding being framed for a drug deal - and had spent some time in prison as a result there. He seems to be an unlucky sort.The weaknesses of Chase's character aside, SEEMS LIKE OLD TIMES is funny, and understandably so - it has a Neil Simon script. In fact, aside from the one-liners that pepper it, there are moments in it that reminded me of other films and plays Simon has written. In some late moments of intimacy between Hawn and Chase I felt that some of Chase's descriptions of Hawn's little idiosyncrasies actually could have been dialog left over from BAREFOOT IN THE PARK, from scenes between Robert Redford and Jane Fonda. And the unwelcome intrusion of Chase into an organized household resembles the situations in THE ODD COUPLE and THE SUNSHINE BOY, where Oscar has to make room for Felix, and Willie Clark has to reunite with Al Lewis.There are plenty of amusing sections Chase fighting back fear and hysteria when he is with the kidnapping bank robbers (when he compliments the wording of the bank robbing note, the robber who wrote it thanks him); Hawn's fighting for the underdog legal practice, which results in her having a growing number of clients she is helping to get honest employment for - even in her own household; Gould's judge trying to get to the point of the ridiculous arguments and fact patterns that first Hawn and later Grodin put into his court; Grizzard's governor looking forward to dinner with his future attorney general, and his favorite dish, only to find the state's number one criminal is serving it to him. All in all it is an entertaining film. But it is not as concentrated and unified a script as FOUL PLAY was. You will enjoy the film, but FOUL PLAY is somewhat more memorable.

Hawn is the wife of the L.A. district attorney (Charles Grodin), while Chase is the ex-husband who comes tumbling (literally) back into her life when he finds himself in a desperate situation. It all plays out like a screwball comedy or bedroom farce, and most of the jokes hit their mark. The three main stars are helped by a good supporting cast of mostly unknowns.Grade B+ "},{"Title":"Is that how it works, Chester?","Date":"19 September 2005","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" I have loved this movie since I saw it in the early 80s when I was in Junior High. For 25 years I have liked to quoted this movie. Every actor was wonderful, and I find it difficult to pick one out as the best. T.K.

When Glenda told Nick to give himself up, she said If you're innocent they will never send you to jail. Nick responds by asking Chester if thats how it works, Chester responds, Not in my neighborhood. Charles Grodin was great as Glenda's husband Ira. I also wasn't that impressed with the scene in the guest room with Chase under the bed while Grodin was sitting on it. I loved that line, however, by Grodin where he said, oh, he was limping. Then of course he's innocent, limper's never lie, limper's are famous for telling the truth. I highly recommend this.

It defines dated.And I hate the word dated. It's incorrectly used a lot. When a film is set in nineteenth century Tombstone, it is supposed to have characters and events that feel like nineteenth century Tombstone. Remarkably, it is the older Wyatt Earp films that are actually less dated. Not saying they are better, but they are less dated.Here, we see the mores of 1980, but only as felt by the outdated blue bloods like Neil Simon.We see here the proof that Simon has always been overrated. He is a modern day Homer. Homer's works survive not because he was a literary giant. They survive because he was the champion brown noser. The Iliad and Odyssey are complete brown nosing works of powerful rulers.And that's all Simon is. The seventies gave us the worst ever in movies. But the comedies were usually still good. The mores were changing, and 1980 was the cusp.Here, Simon has a blueblood comedy with upper society folks being white, except for an obvious token black couple, and all the underlings being anything but Anglo-Saxon.Now this was not only severe discrimination against the usual minorities for obvious reasons, but just as much against the Anglo Saxons who weren't in the upper class. In fact, that group doesn't exist in Simon's world.In Simon's world, not only are all minorities crooks and con artists, but they are failures if they aren't, except for the obvious token black couple, which is just way too obvious to audiences now.It was obvious to people then, too, but just not the people who could afford tickets to theaters. They were hideously behind the times.In fact, the racism of this piece surpasses any racism we see in works of the situational comedies of the forties, fifties, and sixties. And it is worse because Simon and his groupies really believed they were modern thinkers.As for this work, it involves Chevy Chase as a writer who is kidnapped by crooks to rob a bank. Chase is good in good roles, but he can't carry a pitifully written role like this one. His character is boring and not a bit likable. Chevy is likable. And the hope here is that he is likable enough to cover a poor character. Even Cary Grant would have a tough time making us care about this character.The other characters are just as dull. We're given the likable bank robbers. Real funny guys with guns. That was the mind set of the seventies, but only to wackos like Neil Simon's crowd. Not to most people, who were way ahead of them.This isn't the worst movie ever made. You can sit through it without squirming, but probably not without groaning, or looking at the clock. It is dull.This does show what the blue bloods of that era actually thought was the future and what they thought was progressive, but rest assured, the 90% who you didn't hear from thought it was backwards. And we've seen a progression since then, which does make this a dated piece.

You have Goldie Hawn and Chevy Chase in a comedy with a script by the great Neil Simon. How can you miss? Somehow they did.The film starts out promisingly enough when Chase is forced to rob a bank. He goes on the lam and hides at his ex-wife's house. The ex happens to be married to the district attorney of Los Angeles. Ok. The set up has us interested but unfortunately Simon's script becomes repetitive. Ex hubby gets in trouble and runs to ex-wife. Ex wife tries to bail him out. New hubby gets angry at wife. This same situation is repeated over and over again. It's cute at first but the repetitiveness becomes old very fast.The acting is fine. Chase and Hawn are wonderful together and prove their chemistry from Foul Play was no fluke. Charles Grodin is a master at looking bewildered and flabbergasted. You admire the performances and only wish there were more laughs. For me the funniest moment stars Chase's hand. He is hiding under a bed and Grodin sits down while stepping on Chase's one hand. With the other hand Chase shows us the agony he is in. It's quite inspired and funny in a most uninspired film.

Nothing all that spectacular about it, you are not going to be taken on a journey through many places and the plot is not going to have a surprise twist to it. However, it is very funny and that is thanks in large part to Chevy Chase, Goldie Hawn, and Charles Grodin. Though I would say most of the cast is superb in this comedy classic. Chevy Chase plays a guy who was once arrested for a crime that he did not really commit. Seems he is a writer and was doing research for a new book, however he ended up spending time in jail (I think a Mexican prison). Well two guys hijack him at his own home and use him to commit a bank robbery. He becomes a wanted man and ends up trying to find a hideout at his ex-wife's place. His ex-wife who just happens to be married to the DA of either the city this film was set in, or all of California. Do not quite remember which. So we get lots of laughs and Chevy tries to hide and Goldie tries to cover for him and hiding the fact that at times he is right under the bed when Charles Grodin (the DA) is in the room. Lots of near misses and such abound in this one that is for sure. I also found it funny how Goldie Hawn's character kept hiring criminals that she defended in court for odd jobs around the house. Yes, she is a defense attorney, who not only collects ex-cons, but also a whole heck of a lot of dogs. Like I said funny movie thanks to the wonderful chemistry of Goldie and Chevy and wonderful acting from the rest of the cast. "}]
