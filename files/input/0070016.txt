One was so-so, the other thought it was completely awful. Well, I would like to add a third  I thought it was charming.Charlotte's Web is my absolutely favourite story, and one of the most treasured books in my personal library.  This movie, while far from perfect, does stay very true to the original story (which, in case Negative Nellie may have missed, Disney does NOT do -- even though I love Disney, too).It's true the animation isn't the best, but you have to realize that Charlotte's Web was made in 1973, WAAAAAY before the computer-animated wonders of the '80's and '90's.  The animation in the '70's was still stuck in the Saturday-morning-cartoon format, where, instead of animating every single cel, the animators would animate every third or fifth cel.  It saved time, money, and you still got animation -- just not very sophisticated animation.  Disney and Max Fleischer were really the only ones that were trying to push animation beyond the extremely confined limits it was once stuck in.  So you can't really fault the movie for that, it was a common fault 20 years ago to get stuck in a rut.  (It's still happening today, or hasn't anyone watched Godzilla, Armageddon, or Starship Troopers? Just because the animation is more advanced doesn't mean that it isn't becoming redundant).Other than the animation, Charlotte's Web, taken from a purely entertainment level, is really not that bad.  I still enjoy watching this movie, and the voice actors actually closely match the voices I've made in my head for the characters in the book over the years.  Especially Templeton.  His scene when he comes back from his night of gorging at the fair cracks me up.  In case you haven't noticed, there are over 8,000 eggs in that tiny little sac.  This HAS been a night!  HA!The songs seem a little out of place at times, but on the whole, I still find this movie very enjoyable.  It's not deep, it's not profound, it's a piece of mindless fluff, with some very nice performances from the voice actors and a lot of very cute moments.  It's children's fare, folks, so just take it as such, and it's a lot easier to take.  I liked it.  So there.

I'm quite weary of the obnoxious Disney-fication of most kids movies these days. (Spare me any more simpering princess stories.) The story of the clever spider who tries to save a pig from becoming breakfast meat is a familiar one and can be appreciated by many. The voice talent here is so superb that the movie doesn't make you rue the day they decided to animate the book. The songs aren't overly saccharine and are actually quite catchy. The movie is worth it alone for Templeton's trip to the fair and a fair is a veritable smorgasbord-orgasbord-orgasbord song. Debbie Reynolds' Charlotte is warm and wise, Wilber is naive and friendly, and Templeton provides the perfect foil as a spoiled rat who's just in it for himself. Agnes Moorehead as the goose became a sort of comedic extra to make the little ones laugh in the face of the rather adult plot about life and death. Overall, it's a movie for the whole family.

It tells the story of some barnyard animals who interact one summer, but gently, and on a level a child can understand, also analyzes some deep truths about life itself.The story introduces us to a variety of animals (who possess the ability to talk when humans are absent) with unique personalities. One is a frightened pig named Wilbur (voiced by Henry Gibson) who learns his days are numbered in a pig's cruel fate. Another is the scheming and selfish rat Templeton (Paul Lynde in a great comic relief role). Finally, there's Charlotte the spider (Debby Reynolds) who uses the only tool she has at her disposal to try to rescue her friend Wilbur. There are a variety of other amusing creatures in the barnyard, voiced humorously by wonderful actors who are fun to identify as the movie progresses.Humans have an external role in the action. By that I mean they're on the outside looking in (although there are some subplots about the human characters). Many things that are done by the animals are for the humans' benefit. I love Pamela Ferdin's voice for Wilbur's owner, Fern. Human characters change, like the animals do, in parallel stories that emphasize the story's morals about life. Rex Allen's cool country voice, so familiar from Disney nature movies, is perfect for the narration.Several of the songs are great, too. The haunting title song is as lovely and lyrical as the web it's describing. Mother Earth and Father Time beautifully describes the story's main theme. Templeton's mad feast of garbage while singing At the Fair is lots of fun.This is some terrific, radiant, humble movie that presents the best of old school cartoon animation. A sweet story of friendship, love, loyalty, and other positive elements. It's being remade as a live action movie, and I'm not certain how that'll translate from animation; but this original version is recommended for fine family viewing.

Earl Hamner, Jr., of The Waltons fame, creates a seamless plot which retains the true flavor of the book while cleverly rearranging the order of events and giving some of the better lines to different characters. The story of Wilbur, the runt pig saved by Fern Arable and later shipped to her Uncle Zuckerman's farm, only to discover that he's slated for the butcher's knife, is lively and fun. Charlotte, the wise and well-spoken spider played wonderfully by Debbie Reynolds, devises a scheme to save Wilbur's life. Henry Gibson is right on as the naive and nervous but generally happy Wilbur. Agnes Moorhead shines as the haughty and stuttering goose I'm no flibberty-ibbity gibbet! Paul Lynde easily steals the show as Templeton, the smarmy barn rat; his late-night gorge-fest at the fair is a hilarious highlight of the movie. The songs written for the movie are a bit on the syrupy side, but Debbie Reynolds' sweet singing voice and some clever, funny lyrics make them bearable to adults.

Bearing in mind that this is a children's movie, Chin Up (2236) is absolutely magnificent and easily ranks with Sherman & Sherman's best work. I Can Talk (1512) and Lots in Common (3050) are both excellent and timeless. Veritable Smorgasbord (5850, and reprised at 11136) is a lot of fun, though its fun depends a lot on the story, animation, and Lynde's hysterical singing; it wouldn't stand on its own quite as well as the others.Some of them are compromised to varying degrees by the goofy farmyard animal voices singing the songs, but only the most brain-dead Philistine would let that get in the way of enjoying a great children's song.For those reviewers who disliked the songs, it would be interesting to watch their faces while listening to Chin Up a couple times in a room full of children (after all, this is a children's movie), and then listen to them read their own words. I don't know how they could keep a straight face.

Of course there are problems- the animation occasionally isn't that great though there are some truly lovely moments, and one or two songs were out of place. Speaking of the songs though, a vast majority of them are lovely, definitely not the Shermann Brothers' best work but not their worst either. The characters are still appealing, Wilbur is adorable, and Fern is very appealing, but for me the scene stealer was Templeton, very funny he was at times. The voice work was fine too, Pamelyn Ferdin was lovely as Fern, and Debbie Reynolds is perfect as Charlotte, a really warm and loving spider that you can't help but love.

For me it's one of those movies that endlessly entertained me as a child, but it wasn't until I rediscovered it as an adult that I fully appreciated it. E.B. White's genius story of a young girl's and a pig's realization and acceptance of mortality is perfectly preserved here. These are difficult subject matters for both children and adults to grapple with, and the film deserves credit for sticking so closely to the book. The script is deftly structured, and I would argue against anyone who characterizes the songs as filler; they are well-written, charming and show a total understanding of the material and sensitivity to the characters. The soundtrack is gorgeous. On the one hand the animation is admittedly dated, but with its gorgeous vintage appeal it is hardly obsolete. Though its family resemblance to Scooby-Doo-style animation is apparent, it is also obvious that the designers carefully strove for Dick & Jane-era styling. So maybe it doesn't have some of the tricky multi-plane camera work and stuff that Disney would have used, had this been a Disney movie, but it's technological humbleness is quite appropriate. The voice cast couldn't be better, with special props of course to Paul Lynde. I'll just say the ads for this film should have read Paul Lynde IS Templeton!

White book for school as a child, but I'm fairly sure I saw the movie first. I haven't read the book recently enough to be able to comment on how faithful this animated adaptation is. So my review will focus on the movie's merits from a production standpoint. And it has many.As other commenters have pointed out, at first viewing it seems rather hard to believe that this film was made by the same company that produced The Flintstones and Yogi Bear. The animation may look dated by today's standards, and the secondary characters do look like rush jobs, but the central characters - Wilbur, Charlotte, Templeton, Fern, et al. - are animated quite nicely in my opinion. There are moments of real beauty, such as the sequence during Deep In The Dark/Charlotte's Lullaby (the song probably known to most as Charlotte's Web, sung by an all-male chorus). On the whole, the animation is very simple, but it is fluid and it gives the movie a simple, homey charm missing from the CG-heavy animated feature films of today. The songs seem to be quite a point of contention among those who have seen this movie. Some of them are cloying and syrupy, but even the worst songs in this film are good - they're catchy and very well sung. As with many others, Paul Lynde's hilarious reading of A Veritable Smorgasbord as Templeton the rat (also when sung as a duet with Agnes Moorehead as the Goose) is a highlight for me, as is Chin Up, which is guaranteed to stick in your head for hours. Mother Earth and Father Time is touching, especially the reprise of the song coinciding with Charlotte's death. Pamelyn Ferdin (well known as Lucy Van Pelt in several Peanuts TV specials and movies) delights with her own singing abilities in There Must Be Something More. I think I can understand why E.B. White didn't care for the songs, but they are well-crafted nevertheless, and kids should love them, especially the more upbeat songs like I Can Talk and Chin Up. Zuckerman's Famous Pig and Charlotte's Lullaby would later be covered by The Brady Bunch.But the voice acting is what really MAKES the film. I do find Henry Gibson's (R.I.P.) Wilbur a little grating and overacted at times, but some might say he captures the essence of the character perfectly, as Wilbur does tend to be given over to histrionics, which even Charlotte recognizes (Wilbur, I FORBID you to faint!). Debbie Reynolds' Charlotte is perfectly cast - her voice is soft, gentle, and tender, yet doesn't detract from Charlotte's intelligence and craftiness. Pamelyn Ferdin as Fern impresses with the mature qualities of her voice and her great emotional range (she's become an animal rights activist since, which considering Fern's initial saving of Wilbur from the chopping block, is apropos). But it's Bewitched veterans Agnes Moorehead and Paul Lynde (R.I.P. to them both) who really steal the show as the Goose and Templeton respectively, with their hilarious deliveries of some rather catty lines. Paul Lynde in particular was well-cast as Wilbur's somewhat reluctant ally, Templeton, whose catty and sarcastic remarks are always a highlight. All in all, the 1973 Charlotte's Web is still a delight to watch years later. Kids (provided today's kids have the patience for something without Disney/Pixar's bells and whistles) will be delighted by the characters and the fun songs; adults will appreciate the message about the gullible side of human nature that they might have missed the first time around. I haven't seen the live-action 2006 remake or CW2 Wilbur's Great Adventure but I doubt they could be as magical. 9/10 stars.

So when a barn spider befriends a lonely pig, an odd couple is born which serves a purpose for both of their lives. This animated movie, often overlooked because it wasn't a Disney film, retains a special place in many people's heart because it is a movie with a heart, and even if we can't get inside the brain or hearts of the barn animals seen here, we can look at them in a different light than just something who oinks, clucks, snorts, moos or only comes out at night after the humans who might kill them go to bed.Charlotte's Web is a beautiful story of Wilbur, the runt of a litter almost killed, nursed back to health by an innocent young girl, then returned to his pen in order to serve his purpose to man. That means becoming either a chop or side of ham, and while the other animals can have a purpose without being slaughtered, Wilbur fears his days are numbers. This is where Charlotte comes in, the small spider who begins to chit-chat with him until she is ready to reveal who she is. Charlotte likes Wilbur and agrees to help him avoid the slaughterhouse. So one day when the owners come out, they are stunned to see Wilbur standing underneath the web with the words Some Pig written in it. Of course, these rather dumb humans instantly believe that he wrote it, and an instant celebrity is born.Laugh-In's Henry Gibson provides the voice of the sweet Wilbur with plucky Debbie Reynolds a delightful Charlotte. They are surrounded by well known actors as their barn-yard friends, including Agnes Moorehead as a grouchy goose, Paul Lynde as the constantly hungry rat Templeton, and Dave Madden as the very serious ram. Reynolds goes back to the type of gregarious teen role she had played at MGM, singing the uplifting Chin Up, and dueting with Gibson on We've Got Lots In Common where they affirm their friendship. Things get more profound as time decreases for the aging Charlotte, Reynolds bringing on tears in Mother Earth and Father Time. To alleviate the sadness coming on, Lynde gets a country fair production number, milking every moment for laughs with his song of gluttony. Wilbur himself gets a big production number, sung to him as if he was one of Jerry Herman's big Broadway heroines, Dolly or Mame.The Sherman Brothers who created some wonderful songs for Disney do the same thing here for this, although the beautiful title song did not get an Oscar Nomination. I always envisioned this being a big Broadway musical and longed to see Reynolds on stage as narrator and singing that song, but all I ended up with was a 2006 remake that lacks the heart of this animated version.

Realizing that his own life is in danger from the fate many pigs meet once they grow to a certain size, Wilbur turns to Charlotte, who vows to save his life.This movie follows the novel pretty closely, including in it many plot elements from the book and a majority of the original animal characters such as Wilbur, Charlotte, Templeton the Rat, the Goose and the Ram, and a majority of the human characters such as Fern, Avery, Mr. and Mrs. Arable, Mr. and Mrs. Zuckerman, Lurvy and Henry Fussy. Earl Hamner Jr. did great on the film story, making each scene and each character memorable. Incorporated in the movie are catchy and uplifting songs by brother songwriters Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman, followed by a terrific music score by composer Irwin Kostal.Charlotte's Web sends great messages of friendship, courage, childhood phases and moving-on - things that resonate in your mind about the cycles of life and something everyone, especially young children, could learn. Charles A. Nichols and Iwao Takamoto did a very nice job directing, providing us with a movie that is happy and sad, but uplifting and entertaining.While I enjoy seeing all the characters in the movie, I thought that Wilbur was portrayed as too whiny at times and I thought the Jeffrey (little gosling) character was unnecessary. He was not originally in the book, is out of place in the movie, and making him Wilbur's friend I think distracts from the friendship of Wilbur and Charlotte. Other than that, most of the characters were great - each portrayed in their own unique flavor. My favorite is Charlotte - strong, witty, kind and lovable; Debbie Reynolds was the perfect choice to voice the character - gentle and soothing. And, The Goose, voiced by Agnes Moorehead, was hilarious. I loved her stuttering and thought the scene where she argued with the Ram about spelling Terrific was classic! Charlotte's Web is one of my favorite animated movies and one of my favorite stories overall and is one of they perfect movies for the entire family.Grade A "},{"Title":"Hanna Barbara's likable adaptation of E.B.

Looking back at the movie, I think there are some problems it has, but despite that, I think this is a childhood favorite that holds up for me even as a young adult.The animation, while crude in some parts, is very lovely to look at. The music score is beautiful and the songs, aside from only two being out of place (not the best work the Sherman Brothers have made, but they're not the worst), are memorable and I would hum those tunes for over a decade. The story is timeless and is faithful to E.B. White's work; the characters are likable and the voice acting is top notch. Henry Gibson as Wilbur is endearing, Paul Lynde is very funny as Templeton, the scene-stealer of the movie and Debbie Reynolds is charming as Charlotte and her voice is beyond beautiful.Overall, Charlotte's Web isn't the best, but it's a memorable classic that has stayed with me since childhood.

I recently learned that Hollywood had made a terrible-looking remake in 2006, so in protest I decided to try re-watching the original. I am sorry to report it did not hold up too well. The animation is cheap, the songs feel half-baked, and they kind of botched the close relationship between Wilbur and Charlotte that made the books so charming and heartbreaking. In case you are new to this story, it is about a pig who befriends a spider who saves him from the chopping block in a unique and creative way. It is an adorable concept but as I mentioned it is much better executed in the book by E.B. White. I would recommend showing this movie to little kids who won't notice the sad parts and then giving them the novel when they are old enough. It makes a good first chapter book.

The animation is good for a Hanna-Barbera production, but certainly not even close to Disney. It has a penciled-in quality very similar to 101 Dalmatians, but the motion is not as smooth. No shadows and a slightly 2D look to it. But give this little film a chance Great voice-overs by Debbie Reynolds (Charlotte the spider), Henry Gibson (Wilbur the pig), Paul Lynde (Templeton the rat),and others. A fine musical score by The Sherman Brothers of Mary Poppins fame, a screenplay by Earl Hamner Jr. and great narration by Rex Allen. The animation works best on the barnyard animals and the action does not drag. It is a fast 93 minutes. Charlotte the Spider is very well imagined with big blue eyes and long eyelashes! There are two reasons that this isn't rated higher by me 1.The transfer has washed-out skin tones and scratches & dirt. 2.The story centers about helping Wilbur not end up as dinner at the Fall Harvest, which may upset very young children. Charlotte spins words into her magical wondrous webs, to keep Wilbur alive, while singing about Mother Earth and Father Time. A charming and wonderful animated film. The best scene (with another cute song) shows Templeton Where a rat can glut on scraps at the county fair! Easily the best film Hanna-Barbera ever made.

Although Fern does visit him, it's not the same as she cared for him like her baby. The animation is not brilliant because this film was done long before computers but it still holds up to the story and it always worth watching with young ones and even old ones. The animation is not first rate but it's not bad neither. It's not on par with animation today and don't expect it too.

The transformation from book to film is very well done and adheres to the original fairly closely. Some of the personalities in the story book have been omitted but essentially the message in the film clearly comes across.An innocent little pig is saved from the farmer's axe by a clever spider who lives in the rafters of a shed and observes the goings-on of the farmyard animals below. The spider is called Charlotte and strange though it may seem has taken a liking to the little piglet named Wilbur by the farmer's daughter.In order to save Wilbur a wise and understanding Charlotte works out a scheme that no other spider has ever accomplished. This spider seems to understand human nature very well and she uses psychology to ensure the success of her plan.The characters of the various animals in the film are quite well developed. Wilbur is constantly worried about his future, Templeton a rat is gorging himself all the time, the geese are stammering and repeating their words and the sheep are urging Wilbur to run away. Charlotte observes the commotion in the barn. She is the thinker, the planner, the doer. She calls a meeting, puts forward her plan to save Wilbur and with full support of all the animals Charlotte promises victory.Anybody who loves animals will adore this film It has a kind and gentle quality about it. It shows that true friendship is a most precious gift and something to be treasured. When Wilbur asks Will you be my friend? the plea will melt your heart.Debbie Reynolds has the responsible task of providing the voice for Charlotte. It has to be firm and kind. She does it well. The other voices too are all good.This film will be enjoyed by every young person as well as the young in heart. I imagine many will watch it more than once and seriously consider going on a vegetarian diet.

I especially like how well the characters are drawn - not the animals with clothing and human bodies typical of many cartoons, but they're exactly like real animals. I also love the way the countryside is shown - it must be somewhere in New England. Another thing I love about Charlotte's Web to this day is how the beginning of the movie shows the countryside at dawn, at stages from the break of dawn to daylight, with the mist and everything. The overture played at the beginning harmonizes very well with the stages of dawn, including the lively band playing Zuckerman's Famous Pig when it's daylight. The songs are also well done. When I was a kid, before the age of VCRs and DVDs, we tried to find the album for months. We looked everywhere. We looked all over Saskatoon (where I live), Grandma looked all over San Antonio (where she lived), etc. Finally, my mom decided to order it, but it turned out it wasn't available on soundtrack. Luckily, I got a tape recorder for Christmas, and soon after, Charlotte's Web came on TV. So I tape recorded it off the TV. Why Charlotte's Web isn't available on soundtrack remains a mystery to me. I wonder if it ever was?

One of them was a runt, and gruff papa John Arable trudged out and  was about to give the little piglet the axe when his daughter Fern ran out and stopped him. Though usually a stern man, John now felt bad about what he was about to do and allowed Fern to raise the little pig. She named it Wilbur. She took it everywhere and did everything with it. But pigs don't stay small forever and before long, Wilbur grew into a full sized pig. John demanded he be sold. Luckily, Fern's uncle, Homer Zuckerman had a farm. (E-I-E-I-OH) and bought Wilbur.        Life on Zuckerman's farm wasn't as nice as life with Fern. But Wilbur learned to talk and made friends with a surly old sheep, a gabby goose and even another friend. A spider named Charlotte. Make that a TALKING spider named Charlotte. Another resident of the farm was a rat named Templeton. Nobody liked him and he didn't like nobody. Wilbur soon got word that the Zuckerman family planned to shoot him come winter and turn him into smoked bacon and ham! Wilbur was horrified but Charlotte said not to worry, which was right because the next day she wrote Some Pig in her web! Homer, wife Edith and farmhand Lurvey couldn't believe it! It made the papers as well! Charlotte continued her campaign with the messages Terrific and Radiant. Finally, Homer decided to take Wilbur to the county fair. Charlotte and Templeton went along too. Charlotte performed her talent with the word Humble in her web, while Templeton ate all the half-eaten food and garbage of the fairground. Next day, Wilbur won an award and Mr. Zuckerman got a prize of $25. Twenty five dollars! Good golly! He can now buy that yacht he's always wanted! Ha ha. Anyhoo, sadly, Charlotte died that day. But she left behind kin. Three little spiders. Actually there was a total of 514, but 511 of them went off on their own the minute they were hatched. (They grow up so fast).        Our story has a happy ending. Wilbur lived. This is quite a cute adaption of E.B. White's book. All star voices Debbie Reynolds is Charlotte, Henry Gibson is Wilbur, Paul Lynde is Templeton and Agnes Moorehead is the goose. Lynde and Moorehead are sadly no longer with us but we'll always remember them was quite talented artists. So in conclusion, if you like the book, then I recommend this cartoon.

White many times as a kid, and I can still remember most of the dialogue and the basic story. From Hanna-Barbera (animators of cartoons like Tom and Jerry and The Flintstones), it may not have the same style of animation, it's pretty similar to that of Animal Farm, but it's certainly a good family film. Basically Wilbur the pig was born a runt, but when little girl Fern Arable (Pamelyn Ferdin) pleaded her Dad, Avery (Danny Bonaduce) not to kill him, she looked after him till he was big enough to be sold and taken away. At his new farm, Wilbur (Wedding Crashers' Henry Gibson) learns to talk, meets The Goose (Agnes Moorehead), Templeton the rat (Paul Lynde) and the Ram (Dave Madden). Eventually he finds out that he is meant to be killed to make bacon or whatever, but he meets new friend Charlotte A. Cavatica (Singin' in the Rain's Debbie Reynolds) a wise and singing spider who catches flies for their blood, and can spin great intricate webs. She plans to fool Wilbur's owner, Mr. Homer Zuckerman (Bob Holt) and everyone else to make them believe Wilbur is special, by spinning various words into her web. These words include Some Pig, Terrific, Radiant and Humble. Eventually, with all the popularity of Wilbur, he, Charlotte and also Templeton (who's only interest is food) go to a county fair where Zuckerman has a chance to win a prize. Charlotte meanwhile is not only spinning the webs, but has also made her cocoon for some babies to hatch. Wilbur does win a medal, and Zuckerman says he will let him live, but Charlotte dies (from exhaustion) and Wilbur has to take her nest back home to hatch. When they do hatch, they all fly away, except three runts who stay with him on the farm. Narrated by Rex Allen, and also starring Joan Gerber as Mrs. Zuckerman and Mrs. Fussy, Don Messick as Jeffrey and William B. White as Henry Fussy. With songs by The Sherman Brothers (who did songs for The Jungle Book and Mary Poppins), and a show stealing rat, his eating night at the fair is his highlight, this is a fun family film, and I wouldn't mind seeing it again. Worth watching!

Unfortunately, the DVD's chapters do not take you directly to the songs.It's been 4.5 years since I posted a review here in October 1999 listing the locations of the songs on the 1982 laserdisc, which unlike most laserdiscs was not chapter-encoded. When the DVD came out, I was disappointed that although it was chapter-encoded, those chapters don't help you get directly to the songs.I followed up that October 1999 post with another one in September 2000 commenting on the quality of the writing of the songs, but becoming a father since then has given me an additional perspective.In a nutshell, these are all excellent songs, but most of them are marred by performances that only appeal to very young children. The exceptions are sung by Debbie Reynolds Chin Up and Mother Earth and Father Time (I would exclude the reprise of Mother Earth and Father Time, because although it is also sung by Debbie Reynolds, she is singing in an affected manner as a dying spider). A person who questions the quality of the songs in this movie would do well to listen to these two with their eyes closed, imagining Reynolds singing them.The first song, You and Me, is beautifully written but the singer is perfectly awful. To appreciate this song you need to imagine it being sung by a good singer. The second song, I Can Talk, as well as the fourth, Lots in Common, are well-written songs marred by goofy-sounding singers who are trying to sound like farm animals might if they could sing.Chin Up, as I said here in September 2000, is absolutely magnificent and easily ranks with Sherman & Sherman's best work. Reynolds' performance is excellent. The 5th song, Charlotte's Web, is beautifully written, but is marred by an overwrought arrangement and by being sung by a choir. It's overdone. It would have been beautiful if Reynolds had sung it, with a simpler arrangement. Mother Earth and Father Time may be the most beautiful song in the movie, and aside from the reprise (where Reynolds is trying to sound like a dying spider), is beautifully sung by Reynolds.A Fair is a Veritable Smorgasbord is well-written and Lynde's performance (Part 2) is hysterical.Some Pig is well-written, but most of it only appeals to young children and those who like marching-band songs. But the very first part, sung in A Cappella by a men's quartet, is enjoyable for adults too.The Sherman brothers wrote beautiful, timeless music, and the songs on Charlotte's Web are among their best. I'd love to see this movie remade, keeping only the Sherman brothers' songs, having good singers sing all of them, and toning down the voice affectations (farmyard animals, dying spider).Here are the locations of the songs on the DVD, showing chapter and timeChapter 2, 613 -- You and MeChapter 3, 1450 -- I Can TalkChapter 4, 2208 -- Chin UpChapter 5, 3029 -- We've Got Lots in CommonChapter 6, 3756 -- Charlotte's WebChapter 8, 5353 -- Mother Earth and Father TimeChapter 9, 5817 -- A Fair is a Veritable Smorgasbord (Part 1)Chapter 11, 11115 -- A Fair is a Veritable Smorgasbord (Part 2)Chapter 13, 11909 -- Some PigChapter 14, 12503 -- Mother Earth and Father Time (Reprise)Greg Lovern  "},{"Title":"Fantastic take on the book","Date":"23 December 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Animation, Family, Musical","Review":" This follows the book so well... my 8 year old is entranced at is as I type.I would like to say that the Parental guide on this is WAY over the top!!!

Nichols, Iwao Takamoto / Voices Debbie Reynolds, Henry Gibson, Paul Lynde, Pamelyn Ferdin, Agnes Moorehead Based on the popular book for children, this animated film celebrates life, talents and friendship all spun within a spider web. Wilber the pig is born a runt but is saved the death sentence when the farmer's daughter, Fern takes interest and raises him. When he grows too big Wilbur is shipped to a nearby farm where his future is under threat until a spider named Charlotte spins messages in the web describing the pig as radiant, terrific, humble, etc. This is all very touching with quirky characters inhabiting the barn. Charlotte is brought to life by the voice of Debbie Reynolds who also lends her singing talent as well, but one wonders why the spider isn't celebrated in the media. She seems to be the one with the web art. Wilber has a yearning for life that eventually leads to taking on a bigger task. Paul Hynde voices the sneaky rat Tempelton whose foul greed knows no end however, Charlotte finds use for his talents that lead to a fetching scene at the fair at night. Agnes Moorehead voices the mother goose whose voice is stern and fatal. Only Fern is a problem. She whines too much and her ability to understand the animals is never explained.

This is a great film for youngsters in terms of teaching them about life, mortality and friendship. That and of course the antics of Templeton the rat and the goose for comic relief, for me, makes an exceptional children's film. The fantasy and real life aspect blend together beautifully. We aren't tempted to dwell on anything that pops out as artificial or concocted. The songs are actually very catchy, some of the lyrics are poetic and sweet. This is quite a rare children's film actually; one of the 'kiddie' films that doesn't depreciate the predators in the food chain while emphasizing respect and purpose for all beings. I found that very impressive for a light-hearted film like this. Despite the somewhat childish material, it has a more serious tone in terms of life then many other animated films. It's done in such a way without violence so the film is respectful and heartbreaking, but also cheerful. In other words, the sugar coatation is kept to minimum, but it's still a family film. Some viewers may be concerned with the character Wilbur and his unpleasant whiny attitude. Every character has its' flaws. I imagine that his character was done that way for a reason. Wilbur is a conflicted character. He of course is concerned about his fate and place in the farm food chain. I didn't give this movie a 10 because it isn't a perfect film, however the story is really special and the voice acting is excellent. The film is strong because the source material is so excellent.

The song lyrics are wonderful, the tunes sophisticated, catchy and nicely arranged, and the casting is absolutely perfect (there never could be a better Templeton than Paul Lynde!) Furthermore, the spirit of the book comes through intact. The nature themes and the rhythm of a farm animal's life are nicely conveyed and there's none of Disney's sugar-coating.

White's first classic children's novel, Charlotte's Web. What most students of this film don't know is that E.B. White himself hated it. His ideas for a film version of Charlotte's Web, including an expanded version of the 'Deep in the Dark' lullaby, were largely ignored. I think one of the reasons for this has to do with the notion that author/essayists, and White was certainly among those, do not make for fantastic filmmakers.Truth be told, E.B. White the person was rather stuffy for a man of hid time. For him, the movies were things to be snubbed at all costs; and it irked him, I suspect, that an animation studio was taking on his first big children's novel. That that studio turned out to be no less than Hanna-Barbera virtually gave him no end of fits. Like so many other authors of his time, White had had this obsession of working with Disney; for various reasons which space prevents from disclosing here, such was not to be the case.Still, the film version of Charlotte's Web found its audience through its awesome starpower, notably in the voices of Debbie Reynolds as Charlotte, Henry Gibson as Wilbur, Paul Lynde as Templeton the rat, Agnes Moorehead as the Goose, along with neat secondary work from Dave Madden and Danny Bonaduce (both of them fresh from TV's The Partridge Family); veteran kid voice Pamelyn Ferdin; H-B stalwart voices Don Messick, Bob Holt and John Stephenson; and Rex Allen Sr. tying things up in a bow as our storyteller.Add to this the brilliant animation screenplay (here referred to as simply story) by Earl Hamner (creator of The Waltons) and the haunting score from those darn Sherman Brothers --- and what you have is a haunting piece of animated drama that explores the friendship between a pig and a spider over the course of various seasons. The odyssey of life and death is presented in straightforward, graphic detail; no attempt is made to sugarcoat the concept of death. Of all Hanna-Barbera's theatrical features, only this one has stood the test of time in part because it pulls no punches in its depictions of the circle of life as seen from the perspective of the critters of Homer Zuckerman's farmhouse.Besides, the Shermans never came up with a better marching tune than Zuckerman's Famous Pig; I hope someone arranges the tune for a techno-pop dance mix version. Still, this film has lasted in 30 years because it's a tale that recounts the story of life --- and does not compromise. Few animated features in the 1970s could boast of such a feat and have so many audiences throughout the world embrace it so wonderfully. 'Nuff said.  "},{"Title":"Beautiful Adaptation of E.B.

In your normal children's story of the era, all beings are special, extraordinary The ugly ducking becomes a swan. The chargirl becomes a wise queen.

It is important that he be completely worthless, a simpleton, throughout the story. Otherwise, the nothing should be killed regardless how worthless device to work.The magic of the story is that he is saved by an effect that has nothing whatever with his doing. Something else creates a word not even of his choosing -- he doesn't even know what it means. People, instead of marveling over the spider who can read, write and speak, instead read the words and assign its meaning without question or examination of the story channel through which it came.This is a very peculiar phenomenon, now much tested in a scientific way. We usually think of it in terms of if its in paper (or on TeeVee) it must be true. But the perceptual flaw is deeper.

B. White's classic children's book or the one that I imagined while reading it (which, surprise surprise, was remarkably like the one illustrated in the book). The reason that I point this out here is because I have also studied Charlotte's Web at the University level, and have learned that E.B. White went through several illustrators before finally finding one that got the spider to look the way he wanted her to look. And yes, by the way, there are classes at the University level in which Charlotte's Web is required reading, as is Alice In Wonderland, Through The Looking Glass, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (or Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, if you're not a stupid American like me), Captain Underpants, etc.A small amount of research into the history of Charlotte's Web would surely have revealed White's specific requirement that Charlotte look like a real spider, not a cute Disney spider with a bowl cut, a nice smile, and big blue eyes. Adorable, but her appearance here rather defeats the purpose. There are other discrepancies in the movie that take unnecessary artistic liberties from the book, and while some of them I can understand being changed (such as the fact that Avery, Fern's brother, is introduced skipping happily down the stairs with a big smile rather than as heavily armed as he is when he's introduced in the book), other changes had a serious affect on the story as a whole. Wilbur's maturation, like Fern's, is in fast forward and altered all along the way. As soon as he gets to the farm, he misses Fern so much that he won't eat as soon as he's moved to the farm, because he knows that he's been sold and taken away from Fern. In the book he eats so greedily that he buries his head far enough into his food to get it into his ears, and the narrative presents his thoughts, so we know that Wilbur is at least an intelligent creature, even though he doesn't speak out loud at first. The thing that is lost in the movie version is that, since we can't hear his thoughts, the scene where he learns to speak comes off as contrived and ridiculous. The goose tells him that he has to TRY to speak, so he barely manages to snort out his name, and 15 seconds later he's singing (with a startling vocabulary) a song all about how amazing it is that he can talk. Not only can he talk, but he can dance and sing showtunes, too!The lengthy and complicated words that are thrown in for the benefit of Wilbur's song also take away from the effect of the story as a whole, because despite spouting these huge words and even rhyming them together, he later has no idea what Charlotte is talking about when she says `Salutations' (or, later, `versatile'), a greeting that is meant to signify her intelligence in the book because no words like it had been used up to that point in the story (not quite so in the movie, is it?). This problem is compacted by the fact that Charlotte can rattle off two definitions for `Humble' but can't think of a single word to describe Wilbur without having Templeton find a piece of paper with writing on it. Another thing that really bothered me was the way the relationship between Fern and Henry Fussy ultimately played out. This was one of the questionable things in the original novel, and not only is this romantic relationship between these two 8-year-olds not subdued in the movie version, it is enhanced. Henry shows up at the fair near the end of the movie (looking startlingly different from the last time that he is shown), and Fern winks at him, he tells her that he has some money and wants to take her on the Ferris-wheel, and they leave hand in hand, talking like 16-year-olds rather than the 8-year-olds that they are. Wilbur then cries to Charlotte that Fern didn't even say goodbye to him when she left, and Charlotte reassures him by telling him that Fern will always love him, but that `She's growing up. She's suddenly seeing Henry Fussy with new eyes.' Suddenly is right!There are a few very important lines from the original story that are placed directly into the movie, such as Fern complaining about the injustice of Wilbur being killed for being small at the beginning, and the very last line of the movie, about Charlotte being both a good friend and a good writer, but this only begins to make up for the things that were added or changed in the movie. The usual musical numbers that are found in every animated Disney movie regardless of content are here, and they aren't ALL completely cutesy and contrived (although Wilbur's `I Can Talk' song is unforgivable), but they are definitely typical Disney fodder. The structure of the story is here, but there are some very important things that are changed for the benefit of being a Disney movie. This is, after all, a DISNEY adaptation of a children's literary classic. No less, and, most importantly, no more.    "}]
