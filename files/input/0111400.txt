Charlie Sheen showed he was well on his way to being successful playing comedic roles, as he's doing on television right now.Nastassja Kinski plays the typical new young macho-female role that introduced on screen in the past generation in which females beat up males. Give me a break! Anyway, I still liked her despite the characterization. James Gandolfini was the best of the villains, and also demonstrated how he was about ready to hit the big time, which he also has on TV with The Sopranos. Christopher McDonald was another villain in here but was stupid, not fun to watch. He was angry all the time and his bleached hair looked ludicrous.There are a couple of outrageous action scenes in this film, mostly notably when an automobile with Sheen and Kinski still in it is dropped from an airplane! Yes, to enjoy this film don't take any of it seriously! It's simply fast-paced entertainment. For that, it gets a good rating.

There are many great action set pieces and Charlie has some great one liners too, I mean this isn't meant to be a work of art, its a light hearted action film, and it does it well, I'll even forgive the part that ripped off the ejection seat sequence from Die Hard 2, after all Goldeneye done it too!

The beautiful lady (Nastassja Kinski) he takes on the plane seems to fall to her death as the parachute doesn't open. Brodie quickly finds out that she is alive and well, and gets into the middle of a conspiracy. Soon he is chased by secret agents, gangsters, Russians... everyone, really, and he doesn't know what for. What matters most to this movie is that it is moving fast, as its title suggested. And Terminal Velocity does well as an action movie with its stunts and explosions, if you compare it to others of the genre. Also it has a certain sense of humor because of the unusual situation that the pretty lady perfectly knows the espionage business, while the hero just follows her footsteps and even has to ask her how he can fire a gun. It's not a Bond, but Sheen and Kinski both have much less exciting films in their biography, so most watchers won't be disappointed.

Richard decides to do a little investigating & discovers that Chris is still alive & is an ex Russian KGB agent trying to stop another ex Russian KGB agent Ben Pinkwater (James Gandolfini) from stealing $600 million worth of hi-jacked Russian gold & together with Chris he decides to stop the bad guy's & clear his name...Directed by Deran Sarafian I actually thought Terminal Velocity was a decent & enjoyable little action flick. The script by executive producer David Twohy moves along like a rocket although after the intriguing set up when Chris fakes her own death it sort of settles back down into standard action film thriller territory. The film never seems to take itself seriously & is fairly light hearted with some amusing one liners coming from Sheen, I loved the 'pack your bags we're going on a guilt trip' line he comes out with as Kinski tells him about the hardship Russians have! It's nothing terribly original, it's clich√©d in the sense there are the hero's who eventually defeat the bad guy's & save the day but it's fun & provides a fair amount of entertainment if your looking for some light action.Director Sarafian does a decent job, it's not particularly stylish but it's well made with some good action scenes. The skydiving stunts are particularly impressive although some seem a little far fetched especially the way Sheen rescue Kinski from a car that's been driven out the back of a plane. There are some neat enough explosions & fist fights as well.With a supposed budget of about $50,000,000 it tanked at the box-office making a paltry $16,000,000. The acting is alright with Sheen making a likable hero.Terminal Velocity turned out much better than I thought it would & I'm struggling to see why it bombed so badly when it was released, anyway I liked it & thought it was entertaining fun.

Ever since the late forties had Hollywood got used to the idea of casting Russians as villains, and the habit proved hard to break. If the villains were no longer KGB agents they could now be Russian gangsters or political extremists. There were a number of films of this nature in the nineties (Crimson Tide, Air Force One, The Peacemaker and Fair Game), and the tendency has continued into the twenty-first century with the likes of The Sum of All Fears, Salt and Transsiberian. Terminal Velocity, dating from 1994, is an early example of this phenomenon. Richard Ditch Brodie is a former elite gymnast turned skydiving instructor. Brodie's operation is already under investigation by the FAA because of his laissez-faire attitude to their regulations, and it seems that he is in serious trouble when Chris Morrow, one of his pupils, is killed during a dive. And then something unusual happens. Unusual, that is, by the standards of real life. Less unusual by the standards of the action thriller, in which the sudden return to life of a character whom both the hero and the audience believe to be dead is a familiar (indeed, over-familiar) plot twist.Chris (that's Chris as in Christine, not as in Christopher) turns up alive and well with a semi-plausible explanation for her supposed death. (That shouldn't come as a surprise. Did anyone think the producers were going to cast Nastassja Kinski as their leading lady and then kill her off after only one scene?) Moreover, she also turns up with a new identity. It turns out that she is actually Krista Moldova, a former KGB spy who has been redundant since the fall of the Soviet Union. The rest of the film tells the story of how Ditch and Krista join forces to thwart a gang of her former KGB comrades, now members of the Russian Mafia, who are out to steal a cargo of gold. It appears that the gold is needed to finance a coup which will return the Communist Party to power in Moscow. (Despite her former allegiance, Krista regards such a prospect with horror). Cue the standard explosions, chase sequences, suspense sequences and a finale, cribbed straight from one of the Roger Moore Bond adventures, in which Charlie Sheen performs several completely impossible feats in as many minutes.I fell in love with the lovely Nastassja when I first saw her in Tess, when she seemed like a breath of fresh air. Unfortunately, our love was not to last; Polanski's masterpiece was a tough act to follow and none of her later films, including this one, seemed to be in anything like the same class. It didn't help that the second film I saw her in was Harem, which must by any standards count one as one of the worst movies of the eighties.The film may borrow from the Bond franchise, but it doesn't really bear comparison. Even at their worst, the Bond films had a lightness of touch which Terminal Velocity lacks. With her Slavic looks- she may officially hold a German passport but her family are of Polish descent- Nastassja might have made a decent Bond Girl, but there is little in the film to inspire her. The villains are a nondescript lot and if Sheen drew any inspiration from the Bond series it must have been from the wooden George Lazenby. Terminal Velocity is the sort of dull, derivative thriller that we have seen too many of over the last quarter of a century. 4/10 "},{"Title":"More like a Seventies TV film than anything else.

It is something of a curio. It many different ways, not least the toe-curling 'macho' dialogue, it seems more like a refugee from a cheesy Seventies TV series than a Hollywood film.

In the right conditions, this frankly rather dull action thriller becomes a hilarious comedy, and I'm glad to say that I saw the film under the right conditions. The plot is reminiscent of just about any other 'some guy gets pulled into a dodgy situation' action film ever made, and scriptwriter David Twohy clearly delights in throwing in clich√© after clich√© between and during several explosion infested action sequences. The film is held together by it's leading man; the laughably silly Charlie Sheen, who is just great in the role of Richard 'Ditch' Brodie, a skydiving instructor who is drawn into the 'world of espionage' after a young girl that he'd like to have sex with apparently falls to her death. It's obvious that the plot is just an excuse for lots of stunts because the object at the centre of the tale - some gold disk or something - never really figures properly in the story.The thing that makes this film so hilarious is the fact that you're never entirely sure whether or not the comedy is intentional. Certain one-liners clearly are, but then there's scenes such as the one that sees Charlie Sheen casually mutter 'goddamnit', just as he's about to plummet down a coal burning tower that ensure the doubt still lingers. Charlie Sheen's persona perfectly fits the very silly role given to him in this film. Seeing him swan around with a barrage of 'manly' gestures and a complete lack of modesty ensures that there's always something to laugh at during Terminal Velocity. The ending is about as original as saying that you've packed everything but the kitchen sink, and sees all three of the textbook action film conclusions appear on screen one after another. First we have the high-octane action stunt sequence, which isn't too bad despite being rather hard to buy, even in this sort of film. This is followed by the Mano a Mano dual between lead good guy and lead bad guy, but best of all is the cheesy sentimental final climax, which really had me in stitches. I hope the comedy in this film wasn't intentional.

It is meant to be a fun ride through exaggerated characters and silly set pieces.  The plot is almost pointless - it's just an excuse to hang the set pieces around.  However what you do get is Sheen overacting, great action scenes - the best being Sheen skydiving after a car which has Kinsji locked in the trunk.  You understand? - it's meant to be big dumb fun.  Personally I think this is better than a lot of big summer films that have big special effects scenes and ridiculous plots but try to take themselves seriously.  This knows it's all a bit unlikely but enjoys itself anyway.Sheen is the key to the tongue-in-cheek approach.  He doesn't play a character - he almost just plays himself!  Even when he's in action scenes he's smiling - because he's having fun! and it makes me enjoy it a lot more.  Kinski almost has as much fun in her role, but she has to carry a lot of the plot so she is more serious at time.

After which there were lots of rip-offs which were affectionaly known as Try Hard's or by putting the plot into the die hard title such as Die Hard on the Rockies (CliffHanger) or Die Hard on a huge damn (Terminal Rush) or Die Hard in a Chemical Plant (Open Fire) and so on, and so on.This is a die hard with skydiving - only without the die hard element.  This is supposed to be an action thriller with a bullet proof plot, but unfortuently the plot, script and the online chemistry between Sheen and Kinski doesn't work.Nothing works in this really, really tired film.  The director tries REALLY hard to make some good action sequences - the diving without parachutes, the parachute getting caught in wind farm blades, even a car which falls out of an aeroplane - which looks great - but WHY did they have to make it CGI enhanced?  couldn't they just stick with the stunt man sequence?This film, although slightly better than Drop Zone (which was released the same year) has some good one-liners and jokes - the best being at the end of the film where Sheen gets a medal for killing off the Russian Mafiosi bad guys.All in all avoid this film, go watch Die Hard again its far more fun.

Except The Hero of It !","Date":"28 August 2008","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Mystery","Review":" This is one of the memorable flicks of the 1990s. Of course not in the same shelf that has (Con Air), (The Rock), (Face Off), but you may find it at the lower one, and when you check it out you'll be surprised. The Action is super but not that totally crazy as some likes from the same era. True that the ultimate tagline of all of this kind of movies is don't you ever think but here even if you did, you'd see how it got a little bit of inner logic. You've got to love and respect that script, it did it well. The climax's sequence was so tough a' la James Bond grand style. Thanks to director (Deran Sarafian) who presented also (Gunmen - 1994) another good Action. The only problem, a big one too, is (Charlie Sheen) ! Actually with a movie like that you'd think young (Clint Eastwood), or (Willis), or even (Sly), but not Mr. shining black hair who can't act well. His charisma is weaker than the role. He's funny for sometimes but silly frigid for most of the time. Still good noise though, and definitely the most amusing among the series of the unfortunate events that (Sheen) did it during the 1990s (The Arrival, Postmortem, Free Money, No Code of Conduct, ..etc) before his merciful retirement from cinema (temporarily or eternally I think the cinema retired from him !) to establish a TV career with (2 Men & Half) which's another flop if you asked me. So (Terminal Velocity) compared to (Sheen)'s original disasters is like paradise, but he still in it. I said once that the main defect, sometimes the only defect, with movies by (Tom Cruise), (Ben Affleck) or (Charlie Sheen) is that they're their leads !

I am a cop, and I watch CSI. The only reason I watch CSI is because they have very unique ways of people dying. Other than that it is a dumb unrealistic show just from the very basic points of it. Terminal Velocity has good action sequences. My favorite scene is where he and Natasha are in the super sonic land rocket and use it to get away from the bad guys. Completely unrealistic? Of course, but it was exciting. It wasn't great, but it was just a basically entertaining movie. My Point here is don't expect too much from Hollywood.

I'm sorry if that sounds a bit too hard for some people or if you are a big fan of this movie (it's not because I don't like it that you can't love it of course), but this movie really had nothing to offer that blew me away. I don't know why, but somehow it is almost impossible to find an action movie with a decent script or story.It's the same problem with this movie Ditch Brodie (Charlie Sheen) is a maverick skydiving instructor with a reputation that has made of him a first page news item for several times, but that will also cost him his job very soon. One fine day, a pretty girl steps into his office, asking to learn her skydiving. Of course he doesn't say no and he takes her with him on her first dive. But than he makes a fatal mistake, he loses her out of sight for one moment and before he knows what is happening she falls out of the airplane, without having opened her parachute, right to a gruesome death. When he is accused of man slaughter because he didn't attach her static line, he starts an investigation himself, finding out that she had something to do with the KGB and the Russian Mafia who are trying to steal gold from an airplane.Normally this movie would have gone by me completely unnoticed, but because Charlie Sheen, Nastassja Kinski and James Gandolfini were in it, I gave it a try. The acting isn't too bad for the three actors that I just mentioned (although not excellent either), but the others really never exceed the level of the average action flick. In my opinion this movie isn't very good, but at least it isn't as bad as a Steven Seagal or Jean-Claude Van Damme film. I give it a 5/10.

The Russians as menace trope was by then threadbare, the dialogue was wooden, the minutes-long scene of skydiving near the end stretches credibility beyond the breaking point and the characters were flimsy even for a sendup of the genre, which it seemed to be attempting. This is possibly the worst film I've seen in a theater. The only redeeming feature I saw in it was that a few scenes in it showed the some of cool scenery near my hometown. I don't have contempt for this movie, just pity. Don't rent this movie, because it's too bad to be good, and not bad enough to be so bad that it's good.

The movie is loud, fast and has an unrelenting pace which should keep most movie-goers too preoccupied to be worrying about the absent storyline.Charlie Sheen and Nastassja Kinski star, and both fit the bill nicely as the attractive, home grown (maybe not Nastassja) heroes, yet both have little depth to work with. What disappoints me is that Charlie Sheen is so much better than this. After struggling to make a name for himself, he really sky rocketed to stardom with two sensational performances, first in Oliver Stone's Platoon (86), and then again for Stone in Wall Street (88). Since then though it's been downhill all the way for Sheen as he quickly returned to selecting second rate scripts. Kinski (who still looks sensational) is also much better than this movie would suggest.David Twohy's script, about a hot shot skydiver who suddenly finds his world turned upside down when a mysterious 'student' enters his life, avoids the painfully obvious just enough. There's no obligatory love scene for instance, but all the villains are predictably wicked and two dimensional, and all get their comeuppance. Just another reluctant hero saving the world from evil clutches.Friday, February 10, 1995 - Greater Union Melbourne "},{"Title":"Charlie Sheen proves his versatility","Date":"7 March 2005","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Mystery","Review":" To prove how versatile an actor he is, Charlie Sheen attempted to save a cheap knock-off script called Terminal Velocity. How successful he was depends on how forgiving you are. However, in the eleven years since this steamer rolled out of theaters, we've found that comedy is more his forte than action. Which is not bad from an actor's point of view. After all, pretending to blow things up is easy. Eliciting laughs from an increasingly cynical modern audience, that's hard. Indeed, like many actors who became synonymous with B-grade features, Charlie may well have a bright future in television.If Sheen did not need an alternate venue for his career before Terminal Velocity, he would certainly need one after. After the new action film paradigm started by Die Hard in 1988, audiences began to expect a little more depth from their action heroes. It wasn't enough that they could crush walnuts in their buttocks, although efforts like Total Recall show that persons associated with the old, idiotic style of action film are capable of adapting somewhat to this new style. Unfortunately, Sheen never really had the action star thing quite down, if you know what I mean. His performances in The Three Musketeers or Young Guns attest to this.The problem in Terminal Velocity, like the problem in a lot of action films, is that the script does not appear to have been entirely thought through. Plot twists and events seem to happen more for convenience than any serious storytelling element. Unfortunately, this is really the kind of film you cannot review the plot of too seriously without giving away large chunks of the plot. Not that this makes the plot turns any more convincing. In fact, some of the plot conveniences, such as the goals of the antagonists, appear to have literally been made up on the spot that day of shooting.Indeed, Natassja Kinski aside, I defy you to recall the name of an actor from this yawner without looking at the IMDb cast list. Without Sheen, this film would be nothing but two groups of actors firing prop guns at each other. Even the extras are so wholly unmemorable as to make this film a non-event. Fortunately, they manage to hold off on the action film clich√©s for the first hour. But once the clich√©s start, they come thick and fast. Male and female protagonists having a spat that later results in one running to catch up with the other? Check. One antagonist thinking the other is screwing them over until after a spat? Check. Protagonist conning some hapless witness into aiding his cause? Yeah, that tired old one is here, too. As previously indicated, if it were almost anyone other than Charlie Sheen doing all this, it would fall flat.The final nail in the coffin is the cinematography. You've read me commenting about Sergio Leone films where the 2.351 frame is used so dynamically that panning and scanning them should be made a criminal offense. Terminal Velocity is a 2.351 film where one could cut out as much as two thirds of the picture, and nobody would know the difference. This, and the other factors I have just mentioned, lead me to give Terminal Velocity a score of three out of ten. Sheen earns those three points alone.

It contributes nothing new to the series of familiar action movie formulas out there these days and certainly has no clue of what the word originality  means. This movie is a real flop, not because it is poorly directed or constructed--but because we are so accustomed to the material presented.  The film's story is based on a series of amazingly acted stunts and action sequences that are almost at the level of Jackie Chan. Too bad that these scenes are just about all that the plot consist of. Charlie Sheen is reckless skydiving instructor Ditch Brodie, who breaks safety violations frequently and efficiently. As the movie begins he meets a beautiful young woman named Chris Morrow, who shows up wanting an instant lesson.She ends up apparently committing suicide when she somehow unties herself from the safety cords while in the sky on Ditch's plane, and jumped out without Ditch knowing it. He investigates and finds out that things are not what they seem. Terminal Velocity has lame, silly, self destructive dialogue that comes out of the characters senseless mouths. It doesn't developing anything, not even the plot, which is tried to be explained in one particular desperate scene. The characters have such little intelligence, Ditch and Chris getting into trouble becomes a running joke in the movie. Charlie Sheen can't act very well in this super hero type of a leading role. His kind of style belongs in movies like Hot Shots and Money Talks, not something that is serious and daring like Terminal Velocity. His character here is a mixture between Arnold Swarzenagger and Jackie Chan. Sheen can hardly keep a straight face in most of his scenes let along act like a mighty man. Nastassja Kinski is not a whole lot better. The character she plays gives her absolutely nothing to  do except get in trouble over and over again. Oh, yeah, lets not for get to count her in as another one of those heroines that fall hopelessly in love with the hero in the movie's last scene. Sound familiar?I did like the usually boring James Gandolfini, and Christopher McDonald in their performances as the villains. McDonald uses mean facial expressions to let us know who's side he is on, and really lives up to being a bad guy. Maybe it was the nonstop chasing that he did that made me like him more than the heroes, after all, it is hard to root for someone who is always running..remember  The Jewel of the Nile.There is such little dramatic structure to this movie it is almost a shame for audiences to buy this as an action picture. Sure, the film has excitement and a few intense (sort of) scenes that are entertaining, but there is just no impact with the sequences. People fall out of airplanes, parachute into danger, are shot at while dangling in the air, drift into massive electric fans, blow up each other's automobiles, and almost crash going over a hundred miles an hour in some kind of a rocket car..and my reaction to all of this yawn.
