While I can somewhat comprehend those who don't enjoy this movie, I don't share their attitude at all. Cyndi Lauper's lovelorn portrayal of Silvia is perfect in style and comic timing. She is utterly believable. She also pronounces Scandinavian and Incan sounds with flair. Peter Falk displays his usual mastery of comedy as the pathologically lying Harry, reminiscent of his role in The In-Laws (1979). He has the best and most absurd lines dealing with static electricity, a friend's infidelities with his former wives, his desire to be someone (someone with money), and how women are soft and might bounce out of a hotel, among many others. I like Jeff Goldblum in just about every movie he does, including this one, though here as Nick he seems a bit more distracted than usual. Still, that's a trait of many of his characters and is perhaps a component of his charm. Supporting players (Sands, Gress, Lerner, Bieri, &c.) all perform excellently, and the music is enchanting, particularly during the scenic settings in Ecuador. Although I've dubbed a fine DVD copy from a late-night movie channel, I'll buy a commercial release as soon as one's available. If I always wanted an intricate intellectual acting masterpiece with minimal music and scenery, I'd watch 12 Angry Men (1957) another dozen times, but Vibes is just the thing for light, fun fare.

I was 10 years old and my mom took me and my cousins to see it. It has been an absolute favorite of mine ever since. I used to have it on a VHS tape, recorded off of HBO or some other movie channel. That tape had been viewed sooooo many times it became degraded and was all fuzzy when I went to play it. I recently, after several years had gone by since I'd last seen it, began searching for a DVD copy. Much to my chagrin, I've learned it is not available on DVD (which I really want for the obvious reasons, plus, then it could be widescreen.) I finally bought a used copy of the full screen VHS tape. I still love it after all these years. In fact, my niece(age 10) and my nephew(age 11) just watched it with me tonight. They liked it as well. They thought it was very funny (but, not as funny as Transylvania 6-5000 - which we watched on DVD last week). My nephew was particularly amused by Cyndi Lauper's acting - he thought she was great. This movie rocks and even goes beyond the generation gaps! I still consider it one of my favorite movies of all time!!!

Lauper does a great job as the much put-upon Brooklyn dame and Goldblum is quite nice as her more learned and unexpected suitor. Falk is just down right hilarious as the scheming Harry.

It has components of the romantic comedy and the action-adventure film.  It has not been a big success and this must be because the jokes are all about new-age topics- psychic powers, astral travel, mysterious Incan cults, etc.  Nothing is funny if you are not very familiar with the subject. The best mother-in-law joke is not as funny to someone who has never had a mother-in-law, and not funny at all to someone who doesn't even know what one is.The cast, as you can see, includes Falk and Goldblum, two extremely funny guys who give superb performances.  But Lauper also gives, in her first screen appearance, an extremely funny performance; she is a gifted comedienne, and it is a shame her film career never took off.  Sands, Gress and the other supporting actors are also very good in their roles; each character is very vivid and three-dimensional in spite of being comic caricatures.The script, by veterans Ganz and Mandel (Splash, Parenthood, lots of TV stuff) is in my opinion their funniest by far.  So if you have interest in psychic, new-age, metaphysical, channeling and other such eccentricities, you might also find this one of your favorite comedies.

But I liked Cindy Lauper ever since she sang Time After Time. If one simply ignores the naughty entendre of some her songs like Girls Wanna Have Fun, you can feel that she exudes the aura and exuberance of the teenybop, bubblegum crowd which formed the base of her fans at the zenith of her popularity in the '80s despite the fact that she belongs to another age group altogether.Cyndi is funny and can definitely act. Pity that up to now comedic actresses are still under-appreciated. However, we can look to the past and take solace in the fact that actresses like Fanny Brice, Myrna Loy, Barbra Streisand and Goldie Hawn all enjoy sizeable cult followers.Full of witty and hilarious repartees, Vibes is worth viewing over and over.

The film-makers have great resumes, much of them in TV. The cast includes comic masters Falk and Goldblum, and Lauper does a great job in one of her first roles; these are little gems of comic performances. Peter Falk is nearly as funny here as he is in _The In-Laws_. Sands and Gress are great as well.The plot moves along briskly and the action/adventure/travel side of the film works on its own as well as framing the humor. The romance is like something from screwball comedy.So why did the film get such a cold reception? I think this film has done so poorly because the humor depends on being familiar with new-age religion, psychics, channels, ESP, magic, etc. The script lampoons the kind of new-age/psychic phenomena popular in Hollywood. The target audience- those who are familiar with such things and at the same time don't take them too seriously- must only include the three writers.Although the film appears cynical and pessimistic about people, it cheers me way up. It has the same uplifting effect as another under-rated comedy masterpiece, _Into The Night_, also featuring Jeff Goldblum.Films like _The Matrix_ and _Star Wars_ are sometimes praised for communicating a philosophical and spiritual message. While those films certainly wear philosophical robes, I suspect they are actually driven by motives of greed, violence and melodrama. On the other hand, _Vibes_ and _Into the Night_ are both low-key, pessimistic, even cynical films that paradoxically seem to be driven by an inner engine of warmth and insight that can give viewers a real lift instead of hollow thrills.If you like _Vibes_ try another way-out-there under-rated comedy, _Simon_ (1980) with Alan Arkin.

The story has a guy recruiting a lady with psychic powers to help him find some sort of lost city and there is gold to be found. Her powers though are not the most reliable as she gets messages from a person long gone. So she in turn recruits a gentleman with more consistent powers. They end up though being sought after by a more dubious person who is also in search for the ruins. I thought both Jeff Goldblum and Cyndi Lauper were good in their roles, though I do believe Cyndi's character was not to much of a stretch.

Packed with verbal comedy, facial expression contortionist Jeff Goldblum, loopy quips, and ditzy Cyndi Lauper, this Ken Kwapis-directed adventure film is worth a look, especially for fans of (not so) perilous journeys and silly excitement.At a Department of Paranormal Studies research center, Dr. Steele gathers several of the most brilliant psychics to help him with a special project. The two brightest of the bunch are Sylvia Pickel (Cyndi Lauper's acting debut), the epitome of incredibly sexy but dumb-blond girls, and Nick Deezy (a young Jeff Goldblum), a museum employee who prefers not to sacrifice his humanity to be used as a walking Ouija board. His specialty is psychometry, the ability to touch objects and see where they've been &#150; his other gift is skepticism. Sylvia, on the other hand, is accompanied by invisible friend Louise from the other side who forewarns her of dangerous events. She also deals with astral projection, the power to place conscience awareness outside of the physical body &#150; and bad luck with manipulative men (Steve Buscemi makes a brief appearance) and utter losers my last boyfriend was a guy who drank soup by putting his head in it.Harry Buscafusco (Peter Falk) recruits the two talented psychics (for a cool $50,000 in counterfeit bills) on an expedition into the mountains of Ecuador, where they hope to find his missing son. But the mission leads the trio into danger and disaster when it's revealed that they're really in search of hidden Incan treasures &#150; with supernatural powers!

Cyndi Lauper is almost as talented an actress as she is a musician, and this movie reveals that fact again and again.  Cyndi's character Sylvia was hilarious, and they couldn't have picked anyone better for the part.  I would recommend seeing this movie to anyone, it will make you run to the video store to search for more titles starring Cyndi Lauper.

It co-stars three very successful actors and manages well to mix comedy with drama.I can only imagine that reviewers have not given the film enough credit because they might expect it to be bad.This is one of my most favorite films and although, yes, I am a fan of Cyndis' I admit her other films are not as good.Watch it and enjoy ******** "},{"Title":"a fun movie","Date":"23 July 2003","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Romance","Review":"  Hey Equador girl, give it a rest!  You are ashamed of the movie?  Geeez, you're only from the country, it's not like you helped finance the damn thing!Anyway, I found Lauper and Goldblum to be extremely charming and so on time with their witty banter.  I quote lines from this movie all the time. One of my favorites is when Steve Buscemi's character asks Sylvia (Cyndi) if she has any hard feelings about him taking off with another girl.  And she replies, No....no feelings at all....  Genius line and genius delivery. Enjoy the fun!

Sylvia has a spirit guide named Louise, and Nick's specialty is psychometry, which is picking up vibes from objects. They are approached by Harry Buscafusco (Peter Falk) to find his son in Ecuador. Since he's offering a great deal of money, they accept.Falk is lying, of course, and it doesn't take Goldblum long to figure it out. He wants them to find a hidden temple in the mountains where all the psychic energy in the world comes from. One of his friends found it, but is now comatose. But they're not the only ones looking for it.This is sort of a Raiders of the Lost Ark meets The Power. What makes it a cut above a fluffy comedy is the casting of Cindy Lauper, a unique personality, the talented, quirky Jeff Goldblum, and the always wonderful Peter Falk. I think my favorite scene is the one where Goldblum confronts him, and Falk quickly makes up another story to support his lies.Fun movie.

I was a teenager when this movie came out in the theaters back in the late 80's and I don't remember ever seeing it advertised on TV or anything. I did not know it existed. That's probably because it was overshadowed by bigger more expensive blockbuster movies that got more advertisement. I discovered this movie in 1993 and fell in love with it. It is a lighthearted comedy that is not to be taken very seriously...as it was meant to be. Don't expect some large budget masterpiece with serious dialog, serious characters, plot and complicated hidden meanings. It is not and was not ever meant to be that. I've met many people that watch Vibes over and over every year and never grow tired of it...I thought I was alone on that, but no. It raises my mood and just generally makes my day so much better after watching it...I can't really explain it there, but others say the same thing that love this underrated movie. It raises your spirit...something that all the other big expensive highly ranked movies just never did. Don't exactly know why and don't care. Give it a watch and maybe you'll discover a new friend like I did. This is what this movie feels like to me...a reliable old friend that always lightens my spirit.

It's very silly, but it's reasonably funny and the Indiana-Jones-style adventure aspects are pretty well done.The big surprise of the movie when it came out was Cyndi Lauper as a wacky psychic who dresses like a very colorful hooker. She was surprisingly effective as an actress, even though she was simply playing her basic persona. She and Goldblum make one of the most atypical Hollywood romantic couples I think I've ever seen. I won't call this a great comedy, but it is a hugely likable one.

Everyone has a 'thing' they consider 'bad' but still they love it. This is one of my trashy loves.A very unique story line about psychics looking for the lost city of gold. A few great lines and some great body language here and there if you watch for it.This is one of those types of movies that if it pops on the TV you end up finding yourself watching it and saying I wasted my time when it's over. Next time when it comes on TV again, you'll find yourself glued to it again just to see you favorite scenes, hear your favorite lines, and stick it out to the end again just to once again say I wasted my timeBasically, if you had the same reaction to Clue, you'll react to this movie the same way.

No other actress could have pulled off the right mixture of cute, funny, sass and sex appeal then her! Cyndi has a real talent for comedy. She could have been the next Imogene Cocca if given the chance.Remember to relax, laugh, and don't analyze.3 out of 5 stars!

Case in point,  Vibes. When it was released in 1988, most reviews were poor and the film was entirely dismissed as a credible notation on Cyndi Lauper's career. However, Vibes deserves a second look from those critics and especially the public, who brushed this off as a poor film. Beautifully filmed on location in Ecuador, Vibes is the story of two psychics (Lauper and Jeff Goldblum) who are hired by a man (Peter Falk) who is looking for his missing son. What they do not know is that he just hired them to help him find a mythical Room of Gold. The chemistry between Lauper and Goldblum is there. Their bantering and bickering play off well and Falk is there to add even more high comic touches that brighten the film. With a gorgeous, mellow soundtrack (with music by James Horner of Titanic fame), Vibes offers pleasant, light comedy (if many times corny), but will leave those who have viewed it with a smile on their face.Give it a try...you will not be disappointed. Also stay tuned through the credits to hear Cyndi Lauper's fantastic song, Hole In My Heart.

Only VHS. I don't give away the ending, but some of the funny scenes.Psychics Cyndi Lauper and Jeff Goldblum are hilarious. Peter Falk (Columbo) enlists their aid to find his kid.Cyndi and Jeff are just hilarious.In the opening scene, Cyndi points a gun at Peter Falk, after he asks her for psychic advice, and says, Oh, yeah, you're gonna ask me to do something really weird. I laughed throughout the whole thing. In one scene, I think it was Cyndi who says, Someone had ... on this table. The laughs kinda come from nowhere.If you want a kinda strange love story mixed with Jeff's satire and Cyndi's Girls Wanna Have Fun energy, you'll love it.Cyndi's video, Hole in My Heart (All the Way to China), is also hilarious.-Rach "},{"Title":"bad, but funny","Date":"31 August 2006","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Romance","Review":" Jeff Goldblum. Say the name, and most of the time, you'll find yourself thinking about the B-quality movies he has made. This is one of them, but it's fun. If you can handle Cyndi Lauper's voice. If you can handle a pretty bad script. If you can set aside your realism. You might like this one. I just enjoyed the humor. You can get that pretty much anywhere, right? So, if you just want a funny movie, maybe you can find better. But if you want to see one of Cyndi Lauper's few movies, one of Goldblum's most-likely-not-to-be-listed-among-movie-credits (except for possibly Earth Girls are Easy) movies, then sit back and enjoy. I liked the beginning. Lots of psychic humor. Also one of the first movies I ever saw Steve Buscemi in. (If you're a Steve Buscemi fan, maybe you'll like it just because you get to see him for a bit.) Whatever floats your boat.

The part where Cyndi grabs the pyramid and goes into what I guess is supposed to be a mystic trance is truly embarrassing to watch.Cyndi Lauper was a great performer as a singer, and I would argue that singers become successful actors more often than actors become successful singers.(Cher, Bruce Willis...rest my case) Cyndi, unfortunately, apparently learned her dramatic chops from Hulk Hogan, and has all the natural screen presence of a biological specimen.As for Jeff Goldblum, I admit I've never really 'got' his appeal. All his characters are the same smirking, self-satisfied, yet slightly nerdish guy...interesting enough I suppose...once. Still, he has been in one or two decent movies, but this...this....words fail me....This movie is to dumb to even make 'cult' status.

I know, it was a movie made IN Ecuador, not FROM Ecuador, but still!!! Good God that was the longest and most boring hour and a half of my life!Ok, so I have always been a big fan of Cindy Lauper as a singer, and Jeff Goldblum, but gosh they are so awful in this movie that it's not even funny!  Cindy Lauper is probably the worst singer-actress alive! (yes, even worse than Madonna), and I am so surprised by Jeff Goldblum, he was just bad!  He is such a great actor in other movies, such as Jurassic Park and Nine Months, but in this one, his performance sucks! (I tried to put it as nice as I could)Well the landscape is ok, they could have done a better job with it though; even though they showed an awesome footage of Ambato (a City located in the highlands) in the end of the movie when Sylvia is out in the balcony, they could have done better with the mountains scenes, I mean it was just depressing! everything so foggy and dark... Something that I wonder.... Why did they film this awful film in Ecuador?? why not Peru?? Peru has far more Incan stuff than Ecuador, they could have done a way better job with that! And something else.... producers of Vibes take note  have you ever heard of background music?? Gosh they had nothing at all! I mean from times to times you could hear some Ecuadorian music (from the highlands) but that was pretty much it!  I had a lot of trouble not falling asleep in the middle of the movie without music and with those terrible dialogs!   Well all I can say is that this movie is a total disaster from the 80's  bad acting, bad plot, bad dialogs (except when Cindy Lauper starts to speak in Quechua; the Incas native language, that was pretty clever!  I don't understand that language, except some words of it, and I'm not even sure what she said made sense, but who cares?)Anyway bottom line  if you are into Incas, hiking South American mountains or just want to see Cindy Lauper as an actress, you can rent this one, otherwise, AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!
