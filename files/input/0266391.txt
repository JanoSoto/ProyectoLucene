[{"Title":"A Triumph for Bogdanovich","Date":"28 April 2002","Score":"51 out of 58 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  	Obsession, combined with jealousy, was the impetus for an incident that occurred in November of 1924, aboard the yacht of media mogul William Randolph Hearst, and which in the years since has become the stuff of Hollywood legend and lore.  The story has many versions, but the `whisper told most often,' is the one recounted in `The Cat's Meow,' directed by Peter Bogdanovich, a dramatization of what may or may not have happened during that extended weekend birthday-party cruise in honor of pioneer film director, Thomas Ince, which included an eclectic guest list of the rich, famous and powerful.  What is known, is that the party ended with the death of one of the guests, and that foul play and an ensuing cover-up have long been suspected, but never proved.  And one thing is certain  Not a single person aboard the yacht at the time has ever spoken of what happened, at least not publicly; but there are those who believe to this day, that someone just may have gotten away with murder.	Once a powerful force in a young Hollywood, Thomas Ince (Cary Elwes)-- who had formed Triangle Films with D.W. Griffith and Mack Sennett, and later founded Paramount Studios with Adolph Zukor-- has fallen on hard times.  Once responsible for forty pictures a year, he now struggles to get a single film made.  And, his birthday aside, he has decided to mix business with pleasure during this cruise, pitching an idea to Hearst (Edward Herrmann), to combine their resources and make movies together.  Hearst, however, has other things on his mind; rumor has it that his mistress, Marion Davies (Kirsten Dunst), is being courted by Charlie Chaplin (Eddie Izzard), and he has brought them together, here, to observe and decide for himself if anything untoward is going on between them.  Hearst is not only in love with Davies, but is obsessed with her, as well as the course of her career, and he's not about to let this baggy-pants comic actor interfere.  And Hearst, a powerful and controlling man, always gets what he wants-- and what he wants right now is for this business with Chaplin to disappear.  So it is, that in the midst of celebration, paranoia overtakes the host of the party, and it's about to cast a pall over the proceedings and ultimately involve everyone aboard in one of the greatest unsolved mysteries ever to come out of Tinsel Town.  It's a story that Hearst keeps out of the papers, making sure in his own way that dead men, indeed, tell no tales.	Bogdanovich successfully captures the era, as well as the mendacity of this rich assortment of characters, who are all the more intriguing for the fact that they are real people rather than the product of imagination; and it proves that fact is often more bizarre than fiction.  The excesses and overindulgences of many within the Hollywood community during this period rivals anything happening today, and one of the most telling scenes in the film is when novelist Elinor Glyn (Joanna Lumley) offers her take on what Hollywood really is and what it does to those who dwell within.  Glyn is also the narrator of the film; a wise choice, as it adds a balanced perspective to the events as they unfold, and are summarily grounded by her often wry and incisive observations.  The final words of the film are hers, in fact; a final observation that encompasses so much in so few words, that it provides an impact that makes it the perfect ending.  And it makes you realize what a terrific job Bogdanovich did with this film, and how well he brought this material (screenplay by Steven Paros, which he adapted from his own play) to life.	The film is highlighted by a number of excellent and memorable performances, beginning with Herrmann as Hearst.  This is possibly the best work he's ever done in his career, perfectly capturing the many facets of this extremely complex man.  There's a depth to his performance that conveys not only the bravura of a powerful individual-- and one who delights in using it-- but the vulnerability, as well.  He also makes you cognizant of the fact that Hearst is a man capable of almost anything, including creating his own reality, and maintaining it with his limitless resources.  It's one of the subtle, underlying nuances that Herrmann brings to his portrayal, which is altogether convincing and believable.	Kirsten Dunst also rises to the occasion, turning in a remarkable performance as Marion Davies.  It's a concise reflection of a young actress caught up in a situation that is at once enviable and undesirable, who manages to tactfully negotiate the sensitive issues with which she is faced with a sensibility and maturity beyond her years.  And through Dunst, we see the many layers of Davies' personality; the fun-loving girl, as well as the responsible woman, who finds herself in a perpetually tentative environment and selflessly refrains from playing the prima donna or attempting to act as if she is the center of the universe-- something to which too many others who have been swallowed up by the Hollywood lifestyle over the years are prone.  It's a comprehensive and convincing performance that proves that Dunst has the stuff to fulfill the promise made by her work in previous films.  	The performance that surpasses them all, however, is turned in by Eddie Izzard, as Chaplin.  Izzard captures the very essence of Chaplin, physically and emotionally, with a detailed portrayal of the man, created through expression and astute introspection.  This is not the on-screen persona, the `Little Tramp,' but Chaplin the complex individual and artist who is presented here.  Izzard brings him to life with singular nuance and depth, and it's a performance that should, by all rights, earn him an Oscar nomination.  Skillfully acted and presented, `The Cat's Meow' is a memorable film that offers some insights into a town and lifestyle that few have ever experienced.  9/10.

Things begin to fall apart when Hearst suspects a guest - none other than Charlie Chaplin (Eddie Izzard), the most famous man in the world - of having an affair with his actress girlfriend, Marion Davies (Kirsten Dunst).Although the film is entertaining, there is something underwhelming about it. Its stage origins are obvious - characters perambulate from plot point to plot point, spouting exposition, never appearing much more than caricatures, and thus failing to evoke much sympathy.The casting of Eddie Izzard in the pivotal role of Charles Chaplin is a grave mistake, though the script saddles him with a most unsatisfactory characterisation of Chaplin to work with. Chaplin was not a serial romancer, as is implied in the film, but a serial seducer. He would have been the last person to urge a woman to run away with him on the basis of undying love. He spent his most famous years running from women who suggested exactly that, freely admitting to them that while sex was a pleasant diversion, his work came before any woman. It's a casting decision that is an obvious attempt to distance us from the Little Tramp as opposed to Chaplin the real man, but we never get a true sense of either. Ironically, Izzard actually resembles the real Thomas Ince far more than does Cary Elwes, and as a real-life cabaret performer could conceivably have brought the flamboyance and eccentricity of the real-life director to life better than Elwes does.The film also takes an annoyingly facile view of women, perpetuating the dull cliche that all women spent the 1920s with a bad case of St Vitus' dance and addicted to laughing gas. The grating performances of Claudie Blakley and Chiara Schoras in particular throw the beautifully understated efforts of Kirsten Dunst into high relief. Dunst feels like the only real person in this cast of cartoon characters - beautiful, funny, and vital, she is the best thing in the film. Yet there is never any moment in the movie to suggest the true depth of her dedication and passion for Hearst (portrayed as a roly-poly father figure rather than the hard nosed businessman he was), nor any justification for leaving him for the roguish but uncharismatic Chaplin. Unfortunately, the more interesting conflicts in Marion's  life, such as her growing alcoholism and her dissatisfaction with Hearst's insistence on casting her in leaden romances rather than the comedy to which she was so obviously suited, are only touched on lightly.Though it could have been a thought-provoking and complex experience, as Joanna Lumley's poignant final statements imply (and like `Gosford Park' to which it has been compared), in the end `The Cat's Meow' doesn't feel much more substantial than your average game of Cluedo.

Peter Bogdanovich has made a story out of an event whose outcome is still unexplained. What's more, it feels like it actually could've happened. The interactions between the characters leading up to the act are given much more screen time than the actual act itself. So when it happens, it doesn't seem preposterous at all.The story concerns newspaper honcho William Randolph Hearst (Edward Herrmann) and company celebrating the birthday of Hollywood producer Thomas Ince (Cary Elwes) on Hearst's yacht. That company includes Hearst's lover/actress Marion Davies (Kirsten Dunst), Charlie Chaplin (Eddie Izzard), author Elinor Glyn (Joanna Lumley), gossip columnist for Hearst's newspaper Louella Parsons (Jennifer Tilley), and Tom's lover. Tom hopes to negotiate a contract with W.R. Hearst for Marion to star in his next few films, but Hearst is more concerned about the attraction between Marion and Chaplin. Elinor is nearby to dispense advice, while Louella unsuccessfully attempts to mingle. There's also a pair of party girls on board attempting to have a raucous time as possible.The Cat's Meow has an eclectic ensemble with a Robert Altman-esquire taste to it. Edward Herrmann's role may be the most challenging, because he has to juggle eccentric, warmth, and jealousy as W.R. Hearst. Joanna Lumley is wonderfully dry. And for those like me who only remember Eddie Izzard for his droll stand-up work, he's surprising in this film. He's quite good as Charlie Chaplin. Kirsten Dunst is the biggest name on the cast. She's very fetching in the Cat's Meow, and this represents a change of pace from her dearth of Hollywood-oriented films.As good as the cast is, this is really just as much Peter Bogdanovich's film. After the excellent Last Picture Show, he sort of faded away and made smaller films (The Thing Called Love, for example). Although The Cat's Meow will not make him a household name, hopefully maybe his work will garner more attention again. His direction is very good here.Oh, I should also mention the costume design and music here. The production values in general are excellent in imitating the feel of that era. I was reminded a little of Woody Allen's Bullets Over Broadway (and not just the Jennifer Tilly connection). Anyways, The Cat's Meow is a good movie with interesting characters and thoughtful direction.

While much of the screenplay is presumably speculation, it is interesting to see the effects the murder on some of his other guests, like Marion Davies, Hearst's mistress, Charlie Chaplin and Luella Parsons, among others.This film couldn't fail for me &#150; its subject matter involves William Randolph Hearst, a foe of my main obsession Orson Welles, and it contained one of my favorite entertainers in the cast, Eddie Izzard as Charlie Chaplin.  However, while watching the film I had to consider whether the movie was a well-written drama or simply too slow in its development, making the climax more of a let-down than anything.  If the film wasn't book-ended by compelling writing that made you both look deeply into the subject matter from the beginning, then reflect on the past events at the conclusion, I would have said the latter was true.  And while Eddie Izzard was fantastic as Chaplin, and Kirsten Dunst wasn't her usual irritating self as Davies, it was Joanna Lumley who I thought was the breakout star of the film.  Her role was small, but integral to the progression of the film &#150; acting as narrator, analyst and the film's conscience.While not a fast paced, action filled film, The Cat's Meow is pleasant to experience based on its dramatic merits.  Bogdanovich is more of an actor as of late than a director, but this film's character-driven dramatic elements harkens back to his best known classic, The Last Picture Show.  If you are a fan of film history as I am, you will find this film interesting and thought-provoking.--Shelly   "},{"Title":"Excellent","Date":"29 April 2002","Score":"22 out of 29 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  This film, from reclusive director Peter Bogdanovich, traces one of Hollywood's Urban legends.. the rumor that mogul William Randolph Heart (effectively played by Edward Herrmann) accidentally shot movie producer Thomas Ince (Cary Elwes, shedding his trademark smirk) while trying to kill Charlie Chaplin (an excellent Eddie Izzard) who was having an affair with Heart's mistress, actress Marion Davies (Kirsten Dunst, mesermizing as always).  The setup and the performers are excellent and the depiction of Hollywood in the late 1920s is well done and the murder and resulting cover-up are believable.

He has an amazingly vast Encyclopedia of knowledge about Hollywood during this time. He was good friends with the master Orsen Wells and even did the Commentary for Citizen Cane in Wells' place. He was unquestionably the perfect Director for putting this story to screen.Kirsten Dunst is remarkable playing 24 year-old Marion Davies at only 18. She does a superb job in the role and deserved a lot more attention than she was awarded.I strongly disagree with comments that the supporting cast was bad. Everybody was perfect for their role! The sax player WAS a sax player (not an actor) from Berlin (where most of the movie was filmed) and he did fantastic! (He only had one line for goodness sake!)Though I would concur that Jennifer Tilly played Louella Parsons a bit unlike we would expect, I support her decision to treat her this way for the sake of this film. She lightened up the film with her bumbling silliness. So what if Lolly wasn't like that in real life? It worked well for the movie.My only (slight) complaint was the decision to have one of the flappers briefly flash us (show her chest) during a party scene with her, the other flapper, the sax player and Chaplin. It was unnecessary and felt out of place with an otherwise clean movie. My guess is this was the reason for the PG-13 rating.There is hardly any language - in fact Bogdanovich changed the film's only F-word to screw to clean it up even more than the original script. This works much better for the period than filling it with 21st century language.Anybody interested in the 20's, William Randolph Hearst or 'The Golden Age of Hollywood' MUST see this movie!8½ out of 10.

Eddie Izzard is more effective than I expected as Chaplin (partly thanks to an excellent hair and makeup job by some talented designer); Joanna Lumley is compelling as novelist Elinor Glyn; and Kirsten Dunst is winning as Marion Davies (though why movies never use her real-life stutter is difficult to explain). But these elements don't add up to a successful whole. The screenwriter seems to have worked very hard on certain scenes--the meetings between Davies and Chaplin are particularly well crafted--but not so hard on the big picture. Several minor characters don't need to be there, and don't behave consistently. The basic plot is full of illogic (e.g., why does Thomas Ince think it's a good idea to tell Hearst something he really doesn't want to hear?), and the party scenes are repetitive and tiresome. I'd like to think a trip on Hearst's yacht was more fun than the movie indicates. Davies is characterized as a standard bubbly Flapper type, which isn't really accurate, and the screenwriter's ideas about Chaplin and love are implausible. Strangely, Bogdanovich, who seemed so connected to the Thirties in Paper Moon, lacks a similar affinity for the Twenties. He insisted the excellent costume designer use only black and cream, which gives the party guests a very artificial look, and plays only the most stereotypical songs of the period (e.g., Yes, We Have No Bananas). When Hearst insists everybody Charleston, Charleston! it looks as if the actors had a ten-minute dance lesson just before the scene was shot. The lives of silent film stars can make fascinating movies, I'm sure, but not this time.

You do know however, that someone invited to a lavish any thing goes party aboard William Randolph's Hearst's yacht the Oneida in the flash back that follows the funeral will. The movie seems to go nowhere for a while,mostly just watching fun and games of those lucky enough to be invited, even though you know the price one aboard that yacht is destined to pay for this trip. You almost forget the funeral and the mystery of what this movie is about &#150; who is in that casket, but it is well worth the wait. Like any good mystery, the unlucky victim is one you'd least expect, though you'd think it would have been Charlie Chaplin , but we know he lived to a ripe old age. Until it gets to that point, you get to see another take on what William Randolph, child-like but likable and with some pretty quirky flaws, making one wonder how he ever became so rich. As most people have seen Citizen Kane, we already know about infatuation with Marion Davies bordering on an obsession, but probably don't know that a competition for her existed between Charlie Chaplin and Hearst and how this competition creates the mystery as to whoever is in the box got there.The epilogue of this film was probably the most interesting of any film I ever seen. Secrets had to be kept and Hearst was willing to pay any price to see they were kept, granting all who cooperated, and apparently all did, whatever wish (and he could do it) as any genie in any bottle. If you are looking for something different and willing to give this movie a chance, this movie is for you. This movie deserves better than the 6.5 of the IMDb and I give this movie a 7.5/10.

In November of 1924. media tycoon, movie producer and one of the richest and most powerful men in America at the time William Randolph Hearst organized a lavish private cruise on his yacht with many important Hollywood players invited on board. Among them movie producer Thomas Ince with his mistress actress Margaret Livingston in tow, Hearst's own mistress - actress Marion Davies, Charlie Chaplin, writer Elinor Glyn, gossip columnist Louella Parsons, etc.. Unfortunately, not all guests made it back on terra firma in the same condition they left it as Thomas Ince died two days later from the effects of whatever it is that happened to him on that boat. Because of wealth and social status of the people on board at the time of Ince's end, his death was hushed up without proper investigation leading in the years since to many wild rumours as to what exactly occurred. Fuelling these further was the fact that possible foul play witness Louella Parsons, up to that point a mere Hearst columnist in New York, soon after the events got a lucrative lifetime contract with his corporation.In The Cat's Meow Peter Bogdanovich, himself not a stranger to Hollywood entanglements involving good looking young fame-seeking starlets, jealousy, murder, and desperation induced by lack of money, takes one version of the events ('whispers heard most often' as the movie tagline puts it) and runs with it. His movie will inevitably draw comparisons to Bob Altman's Gosford Park - a vastly superior experience, but The Cat's Meow is still worth seeing, though largely on the basis of what it covers rather than how it covers it. If these were completely fictitious events I don't think I'd recommend it. Altman's film is much more enthralling, its script is better and as a result actors end up looking more convincing. Joanne Lumley, whose portrayal of Elinor Glyn seems to be an impression of Jackie Collins, was particularly annoying here. Though it has its good moments, The Cat's Meow with its overall hokiness too many times feels like watching dramatization sequences on 'E! True Hollywood Story'. "}{"Title":"Historic truth?,..or Orson Welles' posthumous revenge?","Date":"1 March 2009","Score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" When Pauline Kael did her celebrated combination of original research and character assassination, entitled Raising Kane, she mentioned that in the course of the final version of CITIZEN KANE that we have Orson Welles pruned out some events put into the script by Herman Mankiewicz. Mankiewicz, for example, wanted to make the eventual collapse of the first Kane marriage to Emily Norton Monroe to be caused by Kane's accidental encouragement of the assassination of Emily's uncle, the President of the United States. This was based on an incident that Hearst's enemies seized on involving Ambrose Bierce (a Hearst columnist in 1900-1901) writing a quatrain about the killing (in 1900) of Governor-elect William Goebel of Kentucky, that suggested that the missing assassination bullet was headed for Washington to stretch McKinley on his bier. When Leon Czolgosz shot and killed the President in September 1901 Hearst's foes recalled the lines and said Hearst encouraged political murder. The original script for Kane had Emily accusing Charles for her uncle's death, and never forgiving him.That was cut, with Emily's growing dislike for Charles based, instead on his ego, his concentration on his newspaper empire and political ambitions, and his neglect of her (and probably their son). The business with Susan Alexander is the final straw.It was not the only cut of a sensational nature. In the final film Susan tells the reporter that he should speak to Raymond the butler because (h)e knows where all the bodies are. In the original script Raymond was (with Susan) a witness to Kane actually killing a man, but covering it up. This is why Raymond remains so important to Kane in his later years. It also helps explain Susan's growing dislike for her husband.It too was cut. Welles was wise here - everyone in Hollywood would have known what that was about, and any denials about Kane not being based on Hearst would have been dismissed because the dead man would have been too much of a coincidence to ignore.In 1941 it was generally suspected throughout Hollywood (and in much of the U.S.) that William Randolph Hearst was in some way responsible for the death (in 1924) of movie director/producer/pioneer Thomas Ince. Ince had been one of a set of guests invited on Hearst's luxury yacht, the Onieda for a cruise. Others on the cruise included novelist Elinior Glyn, Hearst's mistress Marion Davies, the great Charlie Chaplin, Tom Ince, and a newcomer to the Hearst empire, gossip writer Louella Parsons. At some point on the trip (which was supposed to be a two week cruise) Ince was rushed ashore in serious condition and taken to a hospital. He died two days later. The cause was varied according to the bulletins, usually being either a heart attack or a stomach ailment. However, rumors soon emerged that an incident happened on board the Oneida that led to the shooting of Ince, probably at the hands of Hearst.The story has never completely died, and even today there is a small body of evidence that Ince did not die a natural death. The basic scenario was that Ince was on deck when Hearst was chasing Chaplin (who had been fooling around with Davies) and in shooting at Chaplin Hearst accidentally wounded Ince. Hearst was powerful enough to clamp down on the tragedy, but at the same time there was a cost Louella Parsons was just a new employee at the time. Now, she blackmailed her boss into making her a national columnist and a real power in Hollywood.Peter Bogdanovitch (who directed THE CAT'S MEOW) was a close friend of Orson Welles. One can't quite get it out of one's head that this film, a twisted prequill to KANE, was meant as Bogdanovitch's homage to the classic film and his attempt to smear Hearst, who after 1941 did everything he could to hurt Welles.The period detail is very good, and Edward Herrmann makes a dandy Hearst (sort of a return to the mad playboy husband of Goldie Hawn in OVERBOARD, which also takes place on a yacht). Certainly he is supremely confident as the millionaire, but he is also smart. A running story line is that Tom Ince (Cary Elwys) is trying to get Hearst's backing for a rejuvenation of Ince's film career (supposedly on the verge of collapse in 1924) but that Hearst is not stupid enough to waste his money that way. However, Herrmann does also demonstrate that he is more than a little possessive about Ms Davies (Kirsten Dunst), and that he is worried about that little cockney Chaplin (Eddie Izzard) going after his woman. Certainly Chaplin's reputation with the ladies was enough to give any man pause. Jennifer Tilly (Louella Parsons) certainly is keeping her eyes open (she is, after all, a gossip writer), and it pays dividends at the end. As for Joanne Lumley as Elinor Glyn, she gives the film a kind of narrative and framework (Glyn, by the way, if you can't recall her was the woman who termed the euphemism for sex appeal as it, and was to make a screenplay called It that starred Clara Bow, who became the It girl - otherwise she has become pretty forgotten).The film is worth watching - not perhaps another PAPER MOON or LAST PICTURE SHOW, but better than AT LONG LAST LOVE. Do I think Hearst killed Ince? If he did it was a sheer accident, because who would kill a well known figure under such circumstances as part of a comprehensive murder plan! "},{"Title":"Awful.

The year is 1924.  The setting a yacht owned by newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst.  The occasion the birthday celebration of one Thomas Ince, a movie mogol desperate to join forces with Hearst's organization.  The guests Charlie Chaplin, Hearst's mistress, actress Marion Davies, the neophyte gossip columnist Louella Parsons, and famed bodice-ripper writer Elinor Glyn.  The mystery  the sudden death of Ince under potentially shady circumstances.  It is Miss Glyn, serving as the tale's narrator, who states right up front that most of what we will be seeing in this rendition is pure speculative fiction.  Given the fact that writer Steven Peros (who wrote both the screenplay and the stage play on which it is based) had pretty much a free hand when it came to dreaming up a convincing scenario to explain the tragic events of that November weekend, it seems odd that he basically settled for little more than an updated production of  `Othello' played out in a `Great Gatsby' setting.  Hearst is, of course, Othello himself, the powerful leader driven into a jealous rage at the thought of his dearly beloved's betraying him with another man.  Ince plays the part of Iago, a self-centered opportunist who poisons Hearst's mind against Marian's fidelity, using a combination of whispered innuendo and fabricated circumstantial evidence to achieve his purpose (though his motive for doing all this is never very adequately explained, I must confess).  Marian is, of course, the beloved Desdemona - though she seems a less wholly virtuous innocent than the character Shakespeare gave us.  Finally, Chaplin plays a considerably less virtuous innocent than the play's Cassio, the man allegedly having an affair with Othello's &#150; that is to say, Hearst's &#150; dearly beloved.Even without the `Othello' parallels, `The Cat's Meow' never really adds up to very much in the long run.  Perhaps, the characters are too broadly drawn to really make us believe that what we are seeing is an actual historical event and not mere dress-up playacting.  Hearst (Edward Herrmann) seems like little more than a petulant, befuddled buffoon, hardly a man who would be sitting atop one of the world's great corporate empires.  Louella Parsons, as played by Jennifer Tilly, comes across as a hopeless ditz, a nitwit who literally stumbles, through a stroke of `good' fortune, into her long and lucrative career as one of Hollywood's premiere gossip columnists.  And Eddie Izzard makes a thoroughly bland and unconvincing Charlie Chaplin.  He neither looks nor moves like the legendary performer and seems to be completely devoid of the kind of charismatic persona one would naturally associate with Chaplin, both on-screen and off.  Only the lovely Kirsten Dunst makes a mark on the audience's emotions.  Her Marion Davies radiates a high-spirited warmth that brings a touch of much-needed humanity to the rather cold, clinical world these characters inhabit.  Of course, recreating this world is one of the prime dictums of the film, but it is hardly earth-shattering news at this late date (and especially to anyone who has ever read the works of F. Scott Fitzgerald) to discover that the idle rich of the 1920's were all a bunch of shallow, self-absorbed hedonists without morals, values, direction or purpose.  When Glyn gets the chance to sum up the moral lesson for us at the end, we can barely stifle a yawn at the pedestrian nature of the `revelation.'So what makes `The Cat's Meow' worth seeing?  Well, it certainly feeds a kind of morbid fascination we have for that long-ago world of early Hollywood, when movies were in their infancy, their creators larger-than-life figures and their scandals made all the juicier by the fact that the press actually played along with keeping the details a deep, dark secret &#150; thereby enhancing the curiosity factor and guaranteeing that a kind of modern, pop-culture mythology would grow up around that industry and that time.

The Cat's Meow, by Peter Bogdanovich claims to be based on actual events which happened on a cruise hosted by William Randolph Hurst. The writer paid more attention to creating a bizarre cast of characters than taking time to create a story for the bizarre characters to inhabit. The key moments of the story seem implausible; for example, when Hurst accidentally shoots the producer, believing him to be Chaplin. Basing a key element of a story on someone wearing the wrong hat is trite and contrived. The story attempts to be a dark comedy, but The Cat's Meow misses an important piece of this equation, comedy. There is also a lack of empathy for any of the characters. It hardly matters who is shot, who is killed, who is guilty and who is innocent. There is not a strong character to cheer for. As a result the conflicts are difficult to care about and the eventual outcome is incidental.

Director Peter Bogdanovich recreates it based on rumors in The Cat's Meow, a 2001 film starring Kirsten Dunst, Edward Herrmann, Cary Elwes, Eddie Izzard, Joanna Lumley and Jennifer Tilly. The weekend in question is a celebration of producer Thomas Ince's birthday aboard Hearst's yacht with a guest roster that included Hearst, Marion Davies, Ince, his mistress, Margaret Livingston, Louella Parsons, writer Elinor Glyn, Charlie Chaplin and others. Thomas Ince was removed from the yacht, supposedly ill, and died in his home several days later, supposedly of heart failure. Rumor has it that Hearst, suspecting an affair between Davies and Charlie Chaplin, shot Ince by accident, either mistaking him for Chaplin or because Ince happened to be on the dock at the same time and got in the line of fire. Morning newspapers (not Hearst papers) claimed that Ince had been shot; the evening papers did not carry that story, nor did the Hearst papers. No one who was on board the yacht ever spoke of the incident except in the most ambiguous of ways. Louella Parsons' column became syndicated in over 600 papers, and she worked for Hearst until she retired; Ince's mistress Livingston received a whopping increase in salary. She finally retired to manage her husband Paul Whiteman's band.That's the story Bogdanovich goes with, and it makes for a meandering but intriguing story. The meandering part is not so much a fault of the film but done on purpose - it's a weekend yacht party, after all, and Bogdanovich shows us the parties, the conversations and the intrigues of various guests. He captures the atmosphere of the '20s and the splendor of Hearst's yacht very well.It's hard to say how accurate the actors were with their characterizations; for my part, I don't know what Charlie Chaplin, Hearst, Glyn or Parsons were really like. From seeing Marion Davies in films and in photographs, Dunst seems too young, though her acting is good. Herrmann I suspect captures Hearst beautifully - powerful, a good host, a sometimes brutal man and very much in love with Marion. (When he saw Citizen Kane, believing that Susan Alexander was based on Marion, he was most upset at the portrayal of Susan as a drunk.) Tilly plays Parsons as if she was an airhead - I believe externally in real life, Parsons did come off as a silly, ineffectual woman, all the better to gain your confidence; in fact, she was an ambitious person who wielded a lot of power. Tilly captures this; in her last scene, Parsons gets down to business and drops a lot of her act. Lumley's Elinor Glyn is elegant, intelligent and more of an observer (she narrates the film) - I suspect that is true as well. Cary Elwes doesn't register much as Ince, who is portrayed as a desperate man trying to get his career back on track with Hearst's help.Eddie Izzard's Chaplin is problematic. Physically he seems all wrong - Chaplin was quite good-looking and much slighter than Izzard; Izzard hints at a British accent but doesn't really come off as very British or very graceful, which Chaplin definitely was. The writing of this character may be incorrect as well, as it's doubtful that Chaplin would have actually wanted Marion to leave Hearst.All in all, though it's not an edge of your seat kind of film, The Cat's Meow is a good film about a fascinating piece of Hollwyood lore. It seems likely that Ince did not die of indigestion, heart failure, or suicide, but that something did happen and the guests were sworn to silence; it's also more than likely that the police and DA cooperated in covering it up. There is an interesting sidebar to this story - Davies' secretary Abigail Kinsolving, was considered a suspect in Ince's death (strange, since he supposedly died of heart failure). She claimed to have been raped by Ince, and it was noted by guests on the yacht that she had bruises on her body. She had a baby some months later and died in a car accident near San Simeon. Two suspicious things there she was found by Hearst bodyguards, and there was a suicide note that wasn't in her handwriting. Her orphaned daughter was supported by Marion Davies. Did Kinsolving know too much? Whether she did or not, the rest of us know too little.

The Cat's Meow presents us with a group of personalities on a weekend voyage that gathers some of the most glamorous stars of the era. The yacht belongs to William Randolph Hearst who has invited some of the biggest movers and shakers for some fun as they cruise the Southern California waters. The screen play is by Steven Peros, who also has a small role in the movie.The story is loosely based on an incident that happened in Mr. Hearst's yacht in which a famous producer, Thomas Ince is murdered. This was the object of gossip at the time. In the film, we are taken along for a view of the possible cause of the shooting and how it involved the lives and careers of some of the people aboard that fateful cruise.Edward Hermann is an underestimated actor. Mr. Hermann transform himself into the magnate and gives the performance of his career. We get to see William Hearst as an insecure and jealous millionaire who is madly in love with Marion Davies, who he treats as a little girl. In turn Ms. Davies seems to have loved this man for himself, and not for the fame and fortune that accompanied their relationship. Kirsten Dunst makes a perfect Marion Davies.The supporting members of the cast are perfectly cast, the most fun being Jennifer Tilly, as Louella Parsons, the famous gossip diva of the Hollywood of those years. She is totally loyal to Mr. Hearst and she proves to be a tough negotiator at the end, getting a plum deal for herself within Mr. Hearst's empire.Eddie Izzard is appealing as Charley Chaplin, a man who wanted Ms. Davies for himself. Cary Elwes plays the doomed producer Thomas Ince. Joanne Lumley is seen as the mysterious writer Elinor Glyn.The film is lovingly photographed with a detailed account to the art deco of the yacht by Bruno Delbonnel and a magnificent background hit parade of the songs of that epoch.

But the dots are absolutely facile. This would have been better if it imposed a fresh new narrative (however unlikely) on the facts, instead of painfully constructing each element of the melodrama. The junky movie Agatha about Agatha Christies short disappearance in the 30s has more fun spinning it's unlikely theory. This seems to be emulating Death on the Nile, which is aiming pretty low.Cat's Meow gets completely lost in the dubious endeavor of supplying indexical visuals that match the ones you already have in your head for this story and milieu.

Then the next day I started critique it more and noticed more flaws in the movie.  The story didn't seem to gather momentum as it went on, but seemed too even in tone and pace.

But then he is monarch of a huge publishing empire, so guests at the party table do listen when he tells them haltingly to respect his hospitality. What he doesn't say is to stop gossiping behind his back and stop bedding his beloved mistress, at least while he's on board the yacht. But to say that would disrupt the cruise and invite open warfare with the chief offender, the celebrated Charlie Chaplin. So instead, it's party time again as they all swing into the social whirl of the Charleston, and for the old man the demons are once again at bay.Whatever happened during that 1924 outing, there was almost certainly a cover-up, authorities included. And who else could have slammed down the lid more tightly than the fabulously influential William Randolph Hearst. The movie is a fictionalized account of what could have caused the mysterious death of moviemaker Thomas Ince off the California coast. Moreover, considering the enduring 80-year silence, such speculation is not out of order. Then too, as everyone knows, the rich do not live by the same rules as the rest of us. (In fact, no wealthy person has ever been convicted of a capital crime in America.)Not surprisingly, the Hollywood crowd comes across as a bunch of egoistic self-promoters, with an especially unflattering portrait of gossip columnist Louella Parsons (Somebody getting even?). Aboard ship, it's party time all the time, with expected hints of lurid Jazz Age decadence. But then as sardonic novelist Elinor Glin observes, once the music stops, what are the guests left with&#x97;nothing! That may be a comforting thought, but it is hardly justice served. It's a well-mounted production, lavish where it should be, and a good glimpse of the rich and famous at play. As the famously jowly Hearst, Edward Herrmann appears to be an almost unnatural visual double, while Dunst does well as the high-spirited and likable Davies. However, the lumpish Izzard makes for an unconvincing Chaplin in the movie's one casting flaw.

The film is at pains to point out that it only depicts one possible version of events, which unfortunately does rather undermine the convincing storyline.The story begins in Hollywood, a land just off the coast of the planet earth, in that decadent decade dominated by the Charleston, flappers, and bootleg moonshine. The women's costumes are thus visually spectacular &#150; all satin and feathers &#150; but some of the actors seem to be overwhelmed by the splendour, and appear somewhat wooden as a result. The notable exception to this is Kirsten Dunst, who plays the effervescent Marion Davies, Hearst's mistress. However, the best lines in the film surely belong to the wonderfully cynical and sarcastic Joanna Lumley.The thing the movie does capture to perfection is the double standards extant in Hollywood. One of the characters disdainfully dismisses the Prohibition, claiming that alcohol isn't illegal for us. And that seems to pretty much sum up the attitude of the film fraternity at the time &#150; that they are above rules and regulations. Even murder, it would seem, can be hushed up.This isn't a murder mystery as such; anyone with a thorough knowledge of Hollywood history will know who died, and the whispers surrounding the event.

The dialogue is witty and quick, in direct contrast to the direction. In this case it works and helps to underline the tension onboard William Randolph Hearst's yacht that weekend in 1924. Peter Bogdanovich provides a very steady, straightforward direction that suits this story well... he clearly has an affinity for this tale. Steven Peros' screenplay never feels extremely stagey, though the intimacy of even a very large yacht may support a story that I assume was at some point a play. The actors do a fine-to-excellent jobs with their characters. Edward Herrmann is perfect as Hearst; his performance captured the loneliness and paranoia of WRH's life (at least if you believe much of the legend.) Joanna Lumley is also very good, except her Elinor Glyn isn't given enough to do. The major disappointment-and it pains me tremendously to write this-is Kirsten Dunst. Dunst is the best younger actress in Hollywood today and should be given kudos for attempting this smaller period piece; that said, she is very much miscast as Marion Davies. In several scenes she simply seems uncomfortable. Dunst's role is the most difficult of the film however, and flaw does not rest squarely on the actress, but rather her character's development... we never buy the attraction between Davies and Chaplin, which is absolutely necessary for the plot. Still, Dunst is able to capture a bit of Davies' emotionally misguided relationship with the very paternal Hearst in their scenes together. Plus, she can Charleston well! The absolute best performance of the movie (and one of the best supporting performances of the year) belongs to Jennifer Tilly. Sure, Louella Parsons is THE CAT'S MEOW's most playful, comedic role... but Tilly nails it. She plays Lolly Parsons as a rather naive dim-wit upon her arrival on the yacht, but with each scene and each encounter Parson's makes, Tilly strips a bit of the green away and reveals the true animal that made Parson's a force in Hollywood for decades. Tilly's final scene with Herrmann has all the markings of a cliche, but Tilly pours so much into it and is so thoroughly believable, that is becomes a near-classic. A final note it is very interesting to see this film and then listen to Peter Bogdanovich's commentary on the new CITIZEN KANE DVD. It may make a viewer appreciate this small gem a bit more!

While there are various reports as to what happened, this film follows the most talked about which is that Ince informed Hearst that his girlfriend Marion Davies (Kirsten Dunst) was having an affair with Charles Chaplin (Eddie Izzard). Later that night, in a rage, Hearst went to kill Chaplin but instead shot Ince in the back of the head. I'm sure many people have heard this story but director Bogdanovich has done a marvelous job at putting the story into a film and deliver something that is quite intense but at the same time it will also get your blood boiling. The director was a personal friend of Orson Welles and considering Hearst pretty much ended his career, I'm sure Bogdanovich was happy to show Hearst as a evil S.O.B. and that's pretty much what happens here. The entire movie isn't a hate piece aimed at Hearst because most of the time the director is taking a look at the power of not only Hearst but the media in general as well as Hollywood. The opening sequence showing everyone arriving was great fun as we get to hear the Hollywood gossip, which a lot focuses on Chaplin and his recent film, THE WOMAN OF Paris, and people joking about it bombing due to him not playing a part in it. There's also a lot of goofing on him in regards to THE GOLD RUSH costing so much money and him getting the 16-year-old star pregnant. This type of stuff was great fun to hear. In the end we see Hearst using his power to keep everyone quiet and to pay off Louella Parsons (Jennifer Tilly) who would eventually get a lifetime contract by Hearst. These scenes will certainly get your blood boiling and you can't help but feel a strong hatred for Hearst and a certain sadness for his mistress. The performances are all quite remarkable with Herrmann really standing out as the media magnet. Dunst and Elwes are also quite good as is Izzard in the role of Chaplin even though he doesn't come close to Robert Downey, Jr.'s performance in CHAPLIN. The entire look of the film from the sets to the costume design are wonderful and everything is brought together perfectly by Bogdanovich. Seeing this wonderful gem just makes you rather sad that he hasn't been able to make more films over the past couple decades because he's clearly very talented.

But surely a film like this, is bound to become a conversation starter for many film buffs. It is a must-see for anyone who enjoys dramas and romance (I really wouldn't call this a romance movie though). Not as much of a mystery as I was hoping, but this film is a comeback for Peter Bogdanovich.

Every development is contrived and bluntly staged. No educated eye is used. The lessons of Wells and Hitchcock are ignored despite the ample opportunities afforded by the boat. That prompts some viewers to think this was deliberately `old school.' Look again folks he uses the same angle and lighting playbook as everyone, rejecting anything that might be honest, fresh or clever.I must admit that there are some competent shots which pass the motion from one player to another. But since Altman, that's part of the standard vocabulary. I also admit that Dunst has some charm here. But the part revolves around the assumption of a charm of a different sort. What's assumed is some cuteness, with superficial caprice but deliberation underneath. What Dunst gives us is opportunistic caprice all the way down. A good director would have rejected this or repaired it because the whole drama revolves around this disconnect.Every other player tromps through with relatively high professionalism. But the director seems to have had no high level view of the orchestrated whole and instead collaborated independently and differently with each player. That sort of worked with `Picture Show' where the whole point is daft kids playing roles that bump up against each other. Doesn't work here. No.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4 Has some interesting elements.

He deals with Hollywood of the 20's. He shows that Hollywood has been run and still is by interests that are not all business only. It quite depends on who you are, how much money you have and if you know the right peoples and have the right connections. Talent sometime play a little part in your success but usually is an extra bonus. Bogdanovich describe all the above well but during watching the film I couldn't have noticed that Bogdanovich put himself a little bit in distance from the material. He did not seem to care about the characters enough to be fully involved in the project. Yes he has done a good job but it seems lifeless, so lifeless that even an above the average performance from all cast(especially Edward Herrman as W. R. Hearst and Eddie Izzard as Chaplin) could not help this film from becoming so unimportant that it doesn't matter if you watch this film or not.

What do we get?We learn that Hollywood is a nest of viper's and decadents. No big news there. More interesting we learn what a washed up director is willing to do to regain his position of power in the entertainment industry and/or political establishment. It raises the question of whether Peter Bogdanovich is speaking from his own experience through these characters. But what's told is so cynical and ugly and muddled, we're left feeling guilty for witnessing a bunch of hooey that passes itself off as history.The tone of the film has a curious madcap quality that I found more irritating than fun. We're not empathetic with anyone. And the great Citizen Kane polishes off the relationship between Davies and Hearts in a much more convincing way. In The Cat's Meow we're not ever sure of Davies motives for being with Hearst. As soon as we're told one thing, she's off doing the other.And are we to believe that Davies was the love of Chaplain's life? Or is he just trying to cockold one of America's most powerful--and apparently moronic--citizens. The film never makes it clear.What is convincing are the production values. There's a glorious recreation of the yacht and period costumes. I got more out of looking at the construction of some of the lapels on the men's jackets than following a story that libels many of the the most well-known personalities in Hollywood history. No one will remember that the screenplay is pure fiction. The disclaimers that frame the film only make it all the more tentative and unsatisfying.The performers can't be faulted, although Meg Tilly goes way past parody here. Kirsten Dunst never disappoints. She gives the most sincere performance in a sea of scenery chewing. Only Joanna Lumley rises above the material, but so much so that she seems to be distancing herself from the whole enterprise rather than narrating it. One of her first lines is, I'm not here! And I'm sure she wishes she wasn't.This isn't on par with Bogdanovich's trashy, so-bad-it's-good At Long Last Love. It's perched on attempting something serious, but hesitates and stumbles chiefly because it's so full of bitterness towards the beast named Hollywood. This is National Enquirer filmmaking.

And this excellent film shows exactly how it played out. (I knew about this story before I'd seen this film, many years ago.)Furthermore, it is a well-acted film, and the best film performance of a terrific actor, Edward Herrmann, who so often has been relegated to character acting. You have to see this simply for his performance here.I first saw Herrmann decades ago - in the '70s - when he was a standout member of the future-star-filled Second City comedy troupe in Chicago (he was in the troupe with John Lovitz and James Belushi, among others). Back then I thought he was a star on the rise. You might have seen him in such films as the Coen brothers' Intolerable Cruelty, in which he was hilarious. Here, in The Cat's Meow (the title taken from the name of a boat), Herrmann shows he has great depth as a serious actor - and a lead actor. (Yet where were the follow-up roles?)This is also an important story that needs to be known - not the least because it involved Charlie Chaplin (who very nearly got killed during the violence - actually, he was the intended target). It's also a lesson in how the powerful - especially media moguls such as Hearst - literally sometimes got away with murder in this all-too-imperfect America of ours. I don't understand why anyone would say this movie was less than good. I contend that it's very good and worth seeing.And PS Hollywood (and I have nothing invested in this recommendation; I don't know the guy) You might consider Herrmann for another serious lead.

However, there was no coverage in the press, no police action, and of the fourteen passengers on board, only one was ever questioned by authorities. Little evidence exists now, or existed at the time to support any version of those weekend events. History has been written in whispers. This is the whisper told most often. The yacht, you see, belonged to William Randolph Hearst...Welcome to Hollywood, a land just off the coast of the planet Earth...Writer Steven Peros does a good job assembling various stories about what happened aboard Mr. Hearst's luxurious yacht, and fashioning it into a plausible story. The direction, by veteran Peter Bogdanovich, is smooth and skillful. He uses Bruno Delbonnel's fine photography to create a 1920s impression, which looks even better in color than it does in the brief black-and-white opening. Lovely how the coffin segues into Hearst's party boat. The music, peppered by Al Jolson hits, is appropriate...Leading off the main players is pretty blonde silent movie star Marion Davies (Kirsten Dunst). She best in comedies, but lover and sponsor Hearst has been putting Ms. Davies in expensive and stodgy dramas. Handsome movie mogul Thomas H. Ince (Cary Elwes) wants to manage Davies with funding from the W.R. Hearst (Edward Herrmann) newspaper publishing empire. The plot involves Mr. Ince exposing Davies' love affair with silent comedian Charles Chaplin (Eddie Izzard), for personal gain...That Charlie Chaplin is madly in love with Marion Davies is the film's speculative breaking point...Known for his Little Tramp character, Mr. Chaplin has just impregnated underage protégée Lita Grey. Also on board is veteran writer Elinor Glyn (Joanna Lumley). She writes about It and has already promoted It girls (later on, Clara Bow made her It stick).

The story often crops up in books on Hollywood deaths and mysteries. I remember reading about it in Paul Donnelley's Fade to Black, but I've read it in other places as well.The film has a lot going for it, an interesting subject, good performances, and witty dialogue. I have only seen the Director's Cut, and whatever longueurs the film has are probably due to director Bogdanovich putting back in what was originally taken out. Some scenes seem a bit stretched, and there is possibly one Charleston too many, but with that said, it's a cruise worth taking.Newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst, played by Edward Herrmann, and Kirsten Dunst as his mistress Marion Davies, invite a number friends and associates for a cruise on his luxury yacht. Included are Charlie Chaplin, played by Eddie Izzard, and movie director, Thomas Ince, played by Cary Elwes. Also on board is columnist Louella Parsons and novelist Elinor Glyn, played by Jennifer Tilly and Joanna Lumley. Hearst is jealous of the attention Chaplin is paying to Marion Davies, while fading film director, Thomas Ince, fuels the tycoon's suspicions to further his own ends. The result is unexpected and leads to the cover up of a crime that only Hearst's power, wealth and influence could accomplish. There is an impressive performance by Edward Herrmann as Hearst and an engaging one from Kirsten Dunst. Herrmann captures Hearst pretty well if old newsreels are to be believed, he exudes bonhomie, cunning and ruthlessness in about equal measure. However Joanna Lumley steals the show. Her character, Elinor Glyn, is a female version of George Sander's Addison DeWitt from All About Eve. Her dry, cynical observations bookend the film, She also has some of the best lines &#x96; when approached by the annoying Luella Parsons, gushing about how much she loves her books, Glyn escapes by saying, Do forgive me dear, but I just have to go and write another one.Although the 1920's jazz-age soundtrack featuring restored versions of popular songs and music is tinny, nasally and relentless, The Cat's Meow successfully captures the look and feel of the period. An interesting movie, but I suspect the original theatrical release may actually be a sharper version than the Director's Cut.

It is based on Steven Peros' play and tells the story of one of the most mysterious murder ever happened in Hollywood that is still subject of rumours. What Bogdanovich portrays is Orson Welles's version of the murders which is still controversial. The main characters are the publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst(Edward Hermann),his mistress and rising star Marion Davies (Kirsten Dunst),Charlie Chaplin (Eddie Izzard) and film mogul Thomas Hince (Cary Elwes). The story takes place aboard Hearst's yacht on a weekend cruise celebrating Hince's birthday. Among the passengers mentioned before there was British writer Elinor Glyn (Joanna Lumley) ,american film columnist Louella Parsons (Jennifer Tilly), Hince's mistress Margareth Livingstone (Claudia Harrison). The turbid affair between Davies and Chaplin is the reason of the violent jealousy of Hearst who in a tragic and unexpected mistake shoot to death the wrong man ,thought to be Chaplin, that is Ince. Being an influential business man, he was able to cover the murder while Davies decides to stay besides him and end the affair with Chaplin. Bogdanovich captures the suggestive atmosphere of the Old Hollywood and presents an amazing study of characters. Steven Peros worked on the film's script that is heavily structured as a theatrical play itself. The four leading actors are exceptionally commanding in their own roles. Edward Hermann is really absorbed and effortlessly express the ambiguity and morally compromised Hearst with mastery; Kirsten Dunst is in one word terrific, despite the young age (she was only nineteen when she filmed The cat's meow), and conveys all the range of emotions required as she was a veteran actress; Eddie Izzard and Cary Elwes are equally good even though they have not the complex roles as Herman and Dunst. The supporting cast is good as well and provides an interesting contrast with the protagonists. My vote of the film is 8/10. "},{"Title":"The Scandal That Didn't Happen","Date":"6 November 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" For several generations, Citizen Kane (1941) has molded public memory of William Randolph Hearst. For younger film goers, however, another, newer movie, The Cat's Meow (2001), has begun to supplant Citizen Kane in etching Hearst. Citizen Kane at least implied a fictional side by inventing new names for the characters loosely inspired by Hearst and actress Marion Davies. Unlike Citizen Kane, The Cat's Meow makes no concession, offering a panoply of actual historical characters by name, leaving viewers to expect at least a basic reconstruction of events. In truth, The Cat's Meow continues the distortion of Hearst and Davies, but is even more egregiously misleading about the other figures depicted, especially producer Thomas Ince.On a November weekend in 1924, Ince and Hearst had met to finalize plans under discussion for years producing Hearst's movies at Ince's privately owned studio, one of the finest in Hollywood outside of the majors. Since 1910, as revealed in my Ince biography, he had written, directed, or produced some 800 movies, a prolific output that won him fame but was also resulting in ulcers and angina. Outside of his family, only Ince's closest associates suspected; as an independent in Hollywood, often depending on bank loans, Ince had to conceal his ill-health.He had a long weekend with little if any sleep. It began at his home with a Saturday visit from Hearst, and a a preview that night of one of Ince's new films to gauge audience response. The next morning Ince to San Diego and boarded Hearst's yacht for negotiations. After snacking on salted almonds, and unwilling not to join in the toasts (despite his doctor's orders to avoid alcohol) for both his own and his son's birthday, Ince was stricken. In the dawn hours, complaining of fatigue and pain from his ulcers, he went ashore and consulted nurses and a doctor. Ince's wife Elinor and eldest son (age 15, and who would take up the practice of medicine as an adult) hastened to Ince's side and brought him home where, despite the attention of his personal physician, a thrombosis ended his life two days later.The untimely death of a 44 year old Hollywood pioneer is insufficient dramatic premise for The Cat's Meow. Instead of examining his medical record, it amplifies rumors whispered by Hearst's most reckless enemies at the time; Ince had also irked many in the press because he had just produced a cinematic expose of yellow journalism (Her Reputation, 1923). Viewers of The Cat's Meow are shown a libidinous Hearst, jealously believing Davies was involved with Charlie Chaplin, firing a pistol in his rage, yet mistaking the burly Ince for the slight comedian. Supposedly Hollywood columnist Louella Parsons was a witness and so gained her position with his syndicate.On the other side are the facts. Parsons was in New York at the time, and had already been under contract with Hearst for a year. If Hearst were gunning for Chaplin, it is unlikely they would have remained friends until the late 1930s, only becoming disaffected as a result of political clashes. The Cat's Meow erases the Chaplin-Ince friendship and Ince's nautical experience; he had loaned his own racing yacht to Chaplin for a honeymoon cruise. The movie also alleges that Margaret Livingston accompanied Ince, but there is no contemporary evidence; moreover, while she acted in nine movies for him, she was starring in 30 movies for other companies.Elinor would hardly have been complacent in the death of the father of her three young boys. She in no way blamed Hearst, and continued to visit San Simeon; the Inces had been frequent guests in earlier years. Nor did she secure Hearst hush money, since she had a million-dollar estate derived from the sale of her husband's studio and corporate assets, and real estate the couple had already bought.The conspiracy-theorists even suggest that Ince's cremation somehow confirms their beliefs, unaware that the Inces were theosophists, opposed to burial. In fact, the body was examined by police and the case was thoroughly investigated both in the journals and by legal authorities at the time, and no grounds for suspicion were found&#x97;even from Hearst adversaries.The slander about Ince's death in The Cat's Meow is exceeded only by the fabrication of his career. Ince himself is shown as a sycophant, enduring peevish insults from near-stranger Hearst, and lucky to make a film a year. In fact, that year, 1924, fifteen Ince feature movies were released to theaters. At the time of his death, he had nine more productions already before the camera, completed in the following months. He was a major, commercial producer, with several ongoing distribution deals to fulfill, and there was every reason for Hearst and Ince to link; they were natural allies as independents against the ongoing consolidation of Hollywood corporations. Not content with falsifying Ince, The Cat's Meow even maligns Elinor, showing her as not joining her stricken husband, and denigrating her active role in the Ince company, publicly and behind the scenes.The Cat's Meow joins fanciful stories to be found all over the internet about Ince's death, incredible concoctions that invoke every possibility this side of extra-terrestrial intervention&#x97;and which share one element in common not one is sourced in reliable or contemporary accounts. Hearsay is all that is needed. Thanks to Citizen Kane, and later The Cat's Meow, Hearst, Davies, and now Thomas Ince are known more for fiction than history. At least Citizen Kane had the merit of its artistry; The Cat's Meow is simply a tawdry imagining of dissipation, murder and cover-up, and there can be no question how it diverges from the truth. By blighting the memory of filmdom's early titans, The Cat's Meow belittles the cinema's pioneers in fantasizing a scandal in a Hollywood never-never land.

The little insights and lines they speak about their helpless audacity is enough to make this film worth a look. Is his relationship with his young blond starlets more like Hearst's with Marion Davies, portrayed as a helpless December-May faithfulness to support and promote his young beautiful mistress, or more like Charles Chaplin's flirtatious cad who wants the incredible rush of a slam-bam romance at all times but, helplessly, can't be true to those he loves. And is Peter's experience with these young blond starlets the same as Hearst's (professed love by a young woman who is likely to stray to feel more for someone of her own age and type) or does Bogandovich see himself as the Chaplinesque interloper who has more in common with the young beauty, as he might have viewed himself with Dorothy Stratton. And then there is his cynical ruminations that all of these relationships are ruined by Hollywood and its commoditizing of women, entertainment and sex - where everyone has mistresses at various levels from casting couch to obsession -- probably his own experience also.

On the surface it is supposed to be a leisurely frolic but an undercurrent of desperation in terms of career moves and dalliances makes for choppy waters. Ince is facing financial ruin while an impotent Hearst is faced with losing Davies to Charlie who wants her to run off with him.

I was surprised to find that such a massive skeleton lurked in the closet of the Hollywood elite in the 1920's, unbeknownst to many. The cover-up still stands to this day.The story is an intriguing one and one cannot help but wonder if it is true. It seems unlikely, but that a cover-up occurred is very likely in light of the evidence presented. So while the story is exciting and mysterious, this movie just doesn't do it justice.As a huge Eddie Izzard fan, I was glad to hear that he was taking a leading role for once. However, I thought this a weird choice of role. He does not look much like Chaplin, (too tall and of a different physical build) and his style of comedy is vastly different. I thought he did well with the script he was given and deserves more chances to prove his acting potential as portraying a real person is hard and playing a famous one is harder still. Chaplin's known all around the world. It is a tough job to tackle and Robert Downey Jr. did such a good job of it in Chaplin. I must say that the choice of giving him brown contacts was just ghastly in my opinion. It took all expression from his eyes and Eddie's real eye colour is much closer to that of Chaplin.Dunst is NOT a favourite actress of mine. Perhaps just because I feel she is cast in tragically bad movies (teen dramas and Marie Antoinette which was awful). However, she surprised me in this. While she was too young, she did a good job of playing a powerful mistress and gave some real, emotional performances. However, the love of WR was not truly believable in my eyes. It seemed like a father/daughter relationship, not those of lovers.Edward Herrmann gave a good performance as Hearst, as a erratic man of many emotions. I did wonder from this portrayal how WR became as powerful as he did. I didn't sense the shrewd business man that WR must have been, but perhaps excused by the vacation setting. I thought his jealousy and possessiveness was well portrayed and worthy of recognition.Joanna Lumley did a good job of portraying Elinor Glyn, one of the few sane people on a boat of the rich, powerful and downright silly. Jennifer Tilly's portrayal of Lolly was highly comical and didn't quite suit the sombreness of the rest of the characters. But her character was much more 3D in nature than most others, with a shrewd blackmailing at the end to secure her as a powerful writer and a stark contrast to the air-head of the beginning. Cary Elwes was not spectacular as Ince and far from Robin Hood. I felt no sympathy or sadness at the accident and that is a terrible thing, as it is the supposed focus of the entire movie. The script had a few strange elements, to my eyes. The love between Davies and Hearst didn't truly present itself as I feel it could have done. Ince was portrayed as a man who was only after his own ends and was willing to hurt people to get what he wanted. He spoke of his wife often and with love, yet was having a torrid affair. Chaplin would probably never have proposed marriage to Davies, if they indeed did have an affair. His womanizing is legendary, and so is his desire to avoid commitment.I found the costumes quite dull. I understand the motive behind the black and white theme, but it didn't quite suit my idea of the elegance and richness that the people on the boat had. As a party, I would have expected bright colours and fancy clothes, not sombre black and white. The music could be a bit overpowering at times, yet it captured the period well and provided a nice backdrop for the drama. It is sad to think that the events of the weekend will never be explained, and the actions of those present never known or understood.All in all, a good story, good actors and a good diversion. However it fails to fulfil its potential as a blockbuster. Not a movie for all, but highly entertaining to those who love a scandal.

Following his previous comedic hits like Noises Off, Bogdanovich re-creates what might or might not have happened aboard W.R. Hearts yacht, in the mid-twenties, accompanied by his mistress, the young rising star, Marion Davies (Dunst) and the biggest movie star of the time, Charlie Chaplin (Izzard) along with a few other huge icons of the industry. Although, Robert Downey Jr. very much impressed me and Attenborough's 1991 film, Chaplin, Eddie Izzard blew me out of the water. His hopeless-romantic, charming, and witty performance as the little tramp stole the show and showed that although some other actor has already played the same person, that doesn't mean that another can't do it better. Edward Herrmann and Kirsten Dunst were also very convincing as Hearst and Davies, but it was more the satire that Bogdanovich creates that makes the story really believable. The costumes and set design are extraordinary, and the script is funny, cynical and clever down to the very last line. It is a simple film, with a minimal plot, but it is a lovely and charming achievement and I would recommend it to anyone. Let us not forget, such people as Charlie Chaplin and William Randolph Hearst are not exactly the most transparent characters to master.

The films is more refreshing that its prestigious contemporary `Goshford Park', and refers to a genre originated in `Grand Hotel' (Edmund Goulding, 1932) in which a series of characters assemble in one place and are tied together around a particular incident. This type of film allows a degree of character study and multiple points of view, according to the character whose story we're following. The whole builds from bits. If the characters have secrets, the better; if the characters are Hollywood celebrities of the golden era, the better for Bogdanovich.It all circles around the death of director Thomas Ince on board `Citizen Kane' William Hearst's boat during a weekend in 1924. Some of the characterization is in the level of caricature, like Chaplin or Louella Parsons. No doubt these two were infamous and non sympathetic. The problem is that Bogdanovich doesn't separate them from their representation. Therefore the characterization becomes infamous, and unbearable on the screen. On the other hand, Hearst is the most successful creation, because Bogdanovich inspired it more in Kane than in real-life Hearst, it was built with the aid of a film archetype. During the scene where Hearst searches Marion Davis's room, this parallel is more than evident.The film also suffers from its lack of pace, maybe because it is based on a play. There is an effort of adding movement by making the characters walk around the entire boat continually or simply by dancing charleston. The story is well built and the dialogue is witty, but a witty line from any of these snobs is not a witty line by the snobbiest of snobs, George Sanders as Addison de Witt in `All About Eve'. Bogdanovich's try to depict Hollywood as a modern Babilonia fails because the director is too affected by his defeat by Hollywood. In his good old days, Bogdanovich could try this same idea successfully (Nickelodeon, 1976) because then he had a sense of humour. Now, turned into a resentful outsider, irony, without a sense of humour, fatally leads to parody.

With that said, Cat's Meow is a good film in representing the feel of the twenties, especially in respects to the Hollywood film industry.  The costume designs were top  notch and I personally liked the outfits worn by the women.  course, men typically wear suits and only so much can be done with those.  Good choice by Bogdanovich in his use of b/w and color to create time.  They really added to the whole 1920's feel the film went for.But the film isn't perfect.  To me, it's slow in some parts and some issues just seem to get drawn out to a point where you just don't care anymore if they're resolved.

Whatever the 'real' people are like is secondary to crafting a strong narrative, but those who know the bigger picture will often complain that the story ignores this detail or that aspect. The Cat's Meow falls into this trap for some audiences.For those unaware of the story, The Cat's Meow is about a rumored murder committed by media tycoon William Randolph Hearst on board his yacht. He may have been gunning for Charlie Chaplin but ended up killing Thomas Ince instead. The story was covered up by Hearst and remains a bit of a mystery to this day.Some complaints about this film are about the lack of accuracy it has towards the characters in question, but this is a niggling point. The Cat's Meow is like a greek tragedy - you already know how it will turn out, the important thing is what happens along the journey. Watching love, lust and power encircle the passengers of Hearst's yacht is compelling, only sometimes let down by the slower pacing of the film. Seeing the aftermath and watching people sell out themselves (and how it effects them) is fantastic viewing and well worth watching.All the actors put on strong performances which, given the quality of the cast on paper, gives some potentially trite dialogue true spark. The Cat's Meow does suffer from being converted from the stage play to the screen - some scenes appear unneeded while it would have been nice to see a bit more motivation given to a few of the characters - but this is a small point. Overall, The Cat's Meow is an interesting tale from the start of Hollywood that shows you how little people change.

At one point, according to Bogdanovich, this particular version of the events found its way into an early draft of the script for Citizen Kane, later to be excised by Orson Welles. The film's premise has Hearst (Edward Herrmann) madly jealous at Charlie Chaplin's (Eddie Izzard) open courtship of Hearst's lover Marion Davies (a ravishing Kristen Dunst), under the watchful gaze of rapier-wit writer Elinor Glyn (Joanna Lumley) and aspiring gossip columnist Louella Parsons (Jennifer Tilly) and over what was supposed to be a birthday cruise for pioneering Hollywood producer Thomas Ince (Cary Elwes). But Ince is in bad financial shape and needs so desperately to make a deal with Hearst that he's prepared to offer circumstantial evidence of Davies' (non-existent) affair with Chaplin to make sure the ruthless tycoon listens to him. Bogdanovich uses the premise as a way to recapture the decadent glamour of early Hollywood and show that contemporary business practices are no seedier than in the early days - set during Prohibition, the plot has nearly everyone indulging privately in liquor, sex and drugs. You could say that he's having his go at a merciless Hollywood that has systematically undercut him over the past few years, despite his early-seventies track record with The Last Picture Show and Paper Moon (also, remember, period pieces); but, really, this is a film very much in tune with Bogdanovich's own love and fascination for Hollywood history, whether real or legendary, lovingly recreated here with much care and attention. Nevertheless, despite Bogdanovich's sure touch and the actors' general excellence (Dunst's joie de vivre is a pleasure to behold, and Lumley is divinely witty), this is really mainly for film historians, film students or serious movie buffs, since there's little chance that the average contemporary filmgoer will have the slightest idea of who most of these people were in the first place.

The Cat's Meow does not neatly fit into any niche, which by nature should appeal to film lovers.So what is The Cat's Meow? Though it behaves like a murder mystery at times, a romance at others, and a character study in part, it is really a fable about Hollywood. It is made by Hollywood, about a dark secret from Hollywood's history. The characters in the movie talk about Hollywood non-stop. And the end of the film is a thinly veiled political statement by Hollywood to Hollywood about Hollywood. Those who care nothing about neither film history nor the politics and glamour may find The Cat's Meow anticlimactic.This is a movie that the cast and crew obviously enjoyed making. The self-referential banter, the thinly veiled allegory, and the constant cinematic showmanship did interfere somewhat with my appreciation of the story. The Cat's Meow is a decent film, a great DVD, and if you don't mind the speculative take on the events it is well worth your time to check out. I recommend reading up on the story before viewing, or else you'll need a repeat viewing to catch the nuances of the film.

Seems kind of improbable then that jealous murderer, unfaithful mistress and unfaithful mistress's lover would visit victim in the hospital, together.Also, Chaplin for the most part glosses over his active sex life and interests in underage women in his autobiography (he says that his first wife, Mildred Harris, was 19 when he married her, though she was actually only 16; he doesn't even mention his second wife -- also 16 at the time he married her -- by name, just discussing in a short paragraph that their marriage didn't work out.)

However, some of the reviews here (which sound as if there are still paid Hearst employees around) are missing the point that this is based on a play by Steven Peros. Criticism based on the legend aspect of the film is like knocking Amadeus because it is historically inaccurate. The main reality we should be concerned with here is does this film tell a fine tail weaved around splendid acting and highly competent directing?Hell Yes! Besides anyone doubting the realities of the behavior of powerful men such as W.R. Hearst to control others lives thru intimidation or even murder are living in a box. In fact, the film here does'nt go far enough. Bogdonovich actually spends effort to humanize Hearst and Davies.  In this respect, the casting may be the biggest triumph. Dunst continues to impress in her range and may have succeeded the best at fleshing out Davies. However, is there any limit to the style and character that Eddie Izzard brings to any role? He is brilliant. Not as Chaplin the screen star but as Chaplin the man; faults and all. It can't be stated enough the support that is lent by Joannna Lumley, Cary Elwes, Jennifer Tilly et al.

And the feeling for the era was good, a time in which Prohibition was the law but drinking the rule along with similar disparities in other areas, say fidelity and monogamy.I'm a retired clinical psychologist and I found all the characters consistent and believable -- the only partial exception being Lolly Parsons. To me, the ditzy facade of Parsons wasn't consistent with her being able to bargain shrewdly -- for me, it needed an earlier brief glimpse showing that there was a facade obscuring another trait underneath.While Hearst wasn't an admirable character, I especially liked the portrayal of his use of power along with his vulnerability. And Dunst as  Davies was totally believable in her ambivalence and in her ultimate resolution of it.Another review which I read here gave a link to someone's website on Marion Davies that commented on the events of this film and the historical evidence.  I gather from it that events could NOT have happened quite like this.  Okay, so they didn't.  It's still a good story, superbly acted by the ensemble, great costumes and great feeling for the times, and not a single fiery missile, explosion, or computer generated characters.If you need Raiders of the Lost Ark or Lord of the Rings type action -- stay away, you won't like it.

However, I was a bit disappointed, despite the excellence of the main actors, especially Kirsten Dunst as Marion Davies.  The film seemed rather flat, and the ending was surprisingly undramatic.  There is an interesting piece by Nick Langdon at www.decofilms.com/mariondavies/news.htm comparing this film to the known facts of the case, and it's obvious that though the main characters were real enough, the plot of this movie bears only a coincidental resemblance to reality.  Langdon points out that Charlie Chaplin was a close friend of both William Randolph Hearst and Marion Davies long after this incident happened, which would hardly have been likely if Hearst had suspected him of trying to steal his girlfriend.  As I found out from IMDb's own database, though Chaplin definitely seems to have been attracted to teenage girls, the age difference between him and Davies was only eight years (compared to the twenty years between Eddie Izzard and Kirsten Dunst), and in 1924 Davies would have been a reasonably mature 27 (not 19 like Dunst!).  On the pro-conspiracy side, though, it's clear that there *was* a cover-up about Thomas Ince's death, whether to cover up a murder or just on general principles to prevent the inevitable bad publicity.  Also, Langdon claims that Louella Parsons could not possibly have been on the yacht, since in 1924 she was still solidly based in New York.

Peter Bogdonavich's latest movie The Cat's Meow takes a look at what may have happened on William Randolph Hearst's yacht in 1924.  The movie was very beautifully shot, with all the glamour of the Jazz Age, and with a look at Hollywood decadence and corruption, referred to here as the California Curse.

It's 1924 and William Randolph Hearst, `WR' or `Willie', Ed Herrmann the media tycoon of the age is throwing a birthday bash on his yacht, and you're invited.  Marion Davies Kirsten Dunst, his mistress and aspiring movie star will join the birthday boy Thomas Ince Cary Elwes a movie studio owner who's fallen on hard times. A score of others on board include famous actor Charlie Chaplin Eddie Izzard, and an aspiring young gossip columnist from NYC, Louella Parsons Jennifer Tilly.  The rule is `don't mix business with pleasure', but just maybe there'll be some exceptions.  Hearst despises moviemaker Ince, and Ince needs `WR's' money to keep his studio afloat. `WR' desperately needs to make Marion a star if he is to keep her affections.  Marion's mind is with `Willie', but a womanizing Charlie Chaplin has stolen her heart.  A case of mistaken identity almost results in Hearst committing murder, Chaplin becoming a dead duck or seagull in this case and in any event Louella Parsons gets a lifetime sentence.The Cat's Meow is a fun movie that makes the outrageous look commonplace. It's the Yankee version of Gosford Park 2002 combined with a dash of Woody Allen's Bullets Over Broadway, which incidentally also featured Jennifer Tilly.  This movie has great character development and an entertaining, if a bit transparent, story line.  Although there's foul play afoot, this movie is comic relief at heart.  The party guests are drawn to the powerful Hearst like sharks circling a trapped whale, each wanting a piece of him.  In the end he's still strong enough to save his own hide.  As guests depart the yacht, it's as though the weekend never happened.The Cat's Meow is directed by veteran Peter Bogdanovich.  His landmark work The Last Picture Show 1971 chronicled the death of small town Texas and launched actress / model Cybill Shepherd's career.  This current film makes some strong but mostly tongue in cheek statements about Hollywood's culture that apply even today.  The Cat's Meow may yield three Academy Award nominations for acting.  The headliners Ed Herrmann, Kristen Dunst and Jennifer Tilly are a joy to watch and deliver flawless performances.

That artist was the director's mentor and friend, Orson Welles.  The movie has a tendency to float along, but it does so charmingly and with respect toward the real characters portrayed.  However, one thing Welles wouldn't do, and that is create anything that just floated along.  There is plot tension missing here, but that is a small flaw when compared to the whole.  If one is aware of the Welles-Bogdanovich connection, one can't help but to subconsciously search out the Welles imprints.  The main ones are the overlapping dialogue scene between Ince and Hearst in the beginning of the movie, when Hearst shoots the seagull; and the enraged Kane/Hearst tearing up Marion Davies' stateroom looking for evidence of her infidelity. Edward Herrmann almost hulks around like the older Kane here.  Cinema historians, check this one out!

Her on-screen persona is oddly appealing, and surprisingly, she manages to deliver a consistently fine performance each time out. Unlike most of the actresses in her age group she likes playing against type with each outing, (such as her self destructive character in `Crazy/Beautiful', to the aspiring model Mary-Jane, in `Spider-Man'), and manages to deliver time and time again. Here we see her as silver screen movie star Marion Davies, in a film that is as brilliant as her smile.	`Cat's Meow' is based on one of the many rumored possibilities of an event that took place on-board the yacht of William Randolph Hearst (Hermann), an all and mighty media tycoon much like what Ted Turner is today, in 1920's Hollywood,. Just as the film advertises on its poster, this is simply a dramatization of the `whisper told most often'. The event was in fact a gathering of some of the most successful figures in the film industry, to celebrate the birthday of Hollywood film producer Thomas Ince (Cary Elwes). Shady dealings, gossip, and forbidden lust ensue, all of which lead to the death of the birthday boy. The rumor this film decides to bring to light is that in fact William Randolph Hearst was responsible for killing Thomas, having mistaken him for Charlie Chaplin (Izzard) who he discovers is wooing his beloved young star and lover Marion Davies behind his back. Believe me I have not spoiled this for you for you will find that there is more too this tale then that. The characters play off each other so naturally in a story so tight it will seem impossible that this retelling was based on a rumor.	The cinematography is splendid as are the sets and costumes, stunningly recreating these moments. I often find it hard to believe that budgets for films such as this are so small considering how decadent everything looks. Fades between scenes are well-used, serving the story all the better. A beautiful example of this can be spotted in the early moments of the film, when the camera fades from the present shot of Thomas Ince's empty coffin, to the past shot of the yacht as it awaits the arrival of its famous passengers to be.I have been complaining about the lack of good scripts in most films for quite some time, but here we have another rare one that works all the way, in this case fleshing out each legendary character by giving them their own place on the ship instead of their own lines in the script. Of course this film is being steered in all the right directions by director Peter Bogdanovich (I wonder why he's been stuck making such bad TV. movies prior to this), who adds another dimension to these characters by allowing us to see hidden expressions and suspicious looks. The cast isn't comprised of novices either, they know just what to do with the material, delivering in all the right tones and ticks, making this production a full circle success.I often admire the under-rated work of Cary Elwes, who has starred in films such as `The Princess Bride' and `Robin Hood Men in Tights'. He has also performed along with Eddie Izzard in `Shadow of the Vampire', and had parts in `Bram Stoker's Dracula', and most noticeably `Liar, Liar' playing Jim Carrey's competition. I love his delivery, his pace and mostly his expression. He shines in this film, perfectly suiting the period. To be honest though, there is not one flawed performance in this film. Just thinking of them now makes me smile. I loved them all so much, I can't help but plead that you go see this if only to take part in silent admiration for these actors. This movie definitely made for a nice evening at my favorite theater Cinema Du Parc here in Downtown Montreal, one of the only theaters showing this film because of its ultra limited release. I say if you can find it go see it, it obviously has my highest recommendation, being that it was way more entertaining, therefore satisfying, then most films will allow.Extra Note Hopefully the studio does a good job with the film come Oscar time like they did with `Shadow of the Vampire'. It would be a serious waste if this talent went un-rewarded. Again watch out for Kirsten, if she continues like this she may just be the next Julia Roberts.

I was happy with the performances &#150; namely Eddie Izzard as the dashing and flamboyant Chaplin - and worthy direction but was hoping there could have been shots other than on the yacht...i.e. at the studio or the castle/ranch; that would have been a real treat. But for the twist they presented, I guess it served it's purpose - hence the title of course. A terrible habit I got into during the film was comparing it similarities to Robert Altman of how uses a numerous characters and intertwining story-lines yet at times can lead to disarray and inconsistencies (i.e. 'Ready to Wear', Shortcuts') while Bogdonovich's surpasses the challenge of an ensemble cast to generate and substantiate both the scene to scene intrigue and well-performed drama as well as focusing of the proposed love triangle.

"},{"Title":"ingenius plot; deserves wide distribution","Date":"6 May 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  The Cat's Meow begins by reminding us that this may be a true story... that is, there were whispers, and this is one of the most reported whispers.  At the same time, there is an on-going theme of the dance, the Charleston, winding its way through claustrophobic ship corridors.  The characters are the powerful Hollywood producers, and William Randolph Hearst (W.R., or sometimes Willie), mistresses, would-be mistresses, and some writers, all real people, although the events are only a guess.  The characters seem to be play-acting - badly - at spontenaity; W.R. is unable to follow the dance for more than a few minutes.  And yet, there is a kind of Seventh-Seal St. Vitus dance quality about the movie, and one asks, is it all a little passion play?  Make-believe?  Or a planned chess game with the devil?  The play acting becomes more and more real, and even scenes such as a ping-pong game between two minor characters begins to take on a very sinister atmosphere.Less obvious than Bergman, Bogdonavitch shows us a kind of plague, and there is death to go with it.  One of the writers observes that Hollywood itself is a demon, and those who live there lose all morals and all direction. She later observes that without the superficiality of the Charleston dance, there is nothing to connect the people, and that the relationships are meaningless.  It is almost an admission that the romantic connections are only a cover for a coldly planned crime.Orsen Wells, not a character in the movie, was one of those who whispered this plot.  Perhaps he heard the tale from Chaplin.  One can almost hear these whispers coming down through the years; did Bergman also hear these whispers at some point, and the Seventh Seal actually copy from this original event?  Chaplin would have had the intelligence to see some of what was going on, but he might have been too disturbed by the implications to convey all of it.  (Wells and Chaplin did work together on a movie about a bluebeard who murdered his wives.  Chaplin played in, Wells directed.)Thomas Ince had been one of the few who had made movies about real Native Americans using real Native American actors, and was not as much of a xenophobe as some of the other rich Hollywood moghuls.  The party on the boat was Ince's birthday party, but one asks, if W.R. is unwilling to make a business deal with him, then why would Ince have been invited as guest of honor, or if invited by Marion Davies, why would W.R. have attended?  W.R. himself is shown as perhaps a bigot, although that is only a minor moment in the film; but it is the bigoted attitudes of his newspapers and columnists such as Louella Parsons which prove W.R.'s ongoing bigotry.  This seems like a thin motive for murder, but there is certainly more to this plot than a romantic plot, or else one wouldn't find newspapers and magazines even today revealing the movie plot and dismissing this movie out of hand.  Is there still something to hide?  Is news being fed to us that is false, and these newspapers or press feeds still want to cover that up?  Was there a property ownership issue that still might be questioned?  All of these questions might have been brought up by Bogdonovitch (especially the issue of Ince's Indian films), but Bogdonovitch does show W.R. coldly killing seagulls for no reason, and that leads one to think that W.R. was practicing for later... And, they just conveniently land near San Diego, etc.  All very neat, all too planned, alibi's and oaths in place, and who could have cooked up these alibi's and oaths in the heat of passion or in traumatic shock?Why would Charlie have been invited if he had already been noticed as following Marion Davies around, unless W.R. had decided that a little romantic play might distract people from the real plan.  Was a man as paranoid as W.R., and also able to call on any reporter in the entire U.S., unaware of the goings' on of Marion Davies?The acting in this movie is worth the trip, even if one doesn't wish to meditate on the plot's implications.  Like Gosford Park, the drama is about rich a-moral people, and the terrible results of their a-morality are brought out by the end.  Some of the characters do not seem as sleezy as they have been made out to be by tabloids, but the restraint shown by Bogdonovitch goes with a more probable Chaplin than tabloids illustrated. Chaplin was, after all, a powerful writer, actor, director, producer, composer as well as a ladies'man, and he had a terrific, not only a beautiful, head on his shoulders.  The superficial party goers are at least shown to have some humanity.I wish this film had much wider distribution.  It has only now arrived in my area of the country in an art film house.

I felt each character.  The sets were meticulously staged.  They transported me to my self-image of and my personal feel of the 20's.I am disappointed though that Mr. Bogdanovich had a limited budget for this movie and that no major studio in Hollywood backed him up.  (A sign of the times?)  A bigger budget would have been great because there probably would have been an expanded script and more outside 20's sets and scenes, and it would have lifted this movie from its seemingly limiting sets.  I am also disappointed that after 3 weeks, this movie is still being shown in small arthouses in L.A. and that no major multiplex/major exhibitor has picked it up.  Nevertheless, I must congratulate the movie's distributors/financiers (Lions Gate Films and German financiers) for giving the greenlight to this project.Hearst died in 1951, Davies in 1961, Parsons in 1972, and Chaplin in 1977.  No revelation from any of them before they crossed over as to what really happened?  Did Davies, Parsons and Chaplin take the secret beyond their grave?  If they did, it is probably because they did not want to meet an angry and intimidating Hearst beyond the great divide.A footnote  Ince finally got his due in this movie.  In 1994-95, I worked at the famous Culver Studios (the site of Ince's studio in the early 20's) in Culver City, California.  Ince's pictures hang on the wall of the historic main building.

They were really the pivotal characters in the story and they didn't convince me. Izzard was too heavy and too clumsy to be convincing as Chaplin (he reminded me more of a youngish Orson Welles), and there was something too dapper about Elwes for a man supposedly in such desperate straits.

Here is a film with absolutely no noticeable special effects, but the use of ship sounds, particularly the engine, adds special layers to some of the films most powerful scenes.  The camera placement and cutting are as important as the script and the acting, but it will take more viewings to get into the subtleties of how they work.

As far as I'm concerned, that combination is Unisom onscreen. Aside from most Shakespeare adaptations and a few exceptions, stage plays on film just don't work for me. And Bogdanovich's directing style has always been a bit too languid for my taste (Paper Moon and Mask being deviations) -- I much prefer him as a writer or as an actor.However, I was encouraged by the subject matter. I love the Roaring Twenties era, and I am intrigued by the players in this real-life murder mystery. (Bogdanovich has expressly requested that film reviewers refrain from revealing the murder victim, but even if the rumored story wasn't already common knowledge, you pretty much know who's gonna get it from the git-go.) I was hoping for a sort of Agatha Christie meets Citizen Kane dynamic, but what I got was dropping eyelids.The setting is 1924, aboard the original King of All Media William Randolph Hearst's yacht, the Oneida. Hearst (Edward Herrmann) and his mistress, silent screen star Marion Davies (Kirsten Dunst), are hosting a weekend getaway for their swanky friends.The guests all arrive with their baggage, and their, er, baggage Thomas Ince (Cary Elwes), a once-omnipotent film producer who has seen his fame and fortune wane in recent years, wants to merge with Hearst's empire; Louella Lolly Parsons (Jennifer Tilly), a start-up gossip columnist already working for a Hearst paper, wants to move digs from Gotham to Tinseltown; Charlie Chaplin (Eddie Izzard), the notorious womanizer, wants to steal the nubile beauty Marion from Hearst; and the jaded English novelist Elinor Gyn (Joanne Lumley) wants another drink.There is plenty of fodder for naughty fun here -- lavish dinner parties, flashy costume balls, private film screenings, prohibition-snubbing libations, love, betrayal, and a murder -- but it's all just window-dressing. Bogdanovich does have an obvious appreciation for the era and a loving eye for detail, but in this case he's lost the forest for the trees. I might as well have been looking at a flip-picture book called The Cat's Meow.While the dialogue is sharply witty in places, it is still stagy dialog. It sounds far too stilted coming from motion picture actor's mouths. One of my favorite actresses of all, Kirsten Dunst, fares the worst here; she actually looks and sounds uncomfortable speaking many of her lines. She is miscast as Davies to begin with, and she never can quite rise above that (Reese Witherspoon would have been purr-fect). One of her scenes early on in the film with Izzard on deck is almost painful to watch. And Izzard just doesn't bring the Little Tramp to life at all (it's almost impossible to follow Robert Downey Jr.'s Chaplin, though). Furthermore, I never bought Marion's attraction to him, which is absolutely essential to the plot.Tilly plays Parsons for laughs (I didn't like the character as a klutzy blunderer), and Herrmann's Hearst is too much a fool for love (I never envisioned him as a powerful mogul). The only two major characters who escape this cinematic shipwreck unscathed are Lumley as the wise, jaded, and droll novelist, and Elwes as the desperate Ince.The Cat's Meow is shot and directed in an unexpectedly pedestrian manner. Billed as a thriller, it looks and feels less thrilling than a typical made-for-Lifetime movie. While (I hate to say it) Bogdanovich's best work may be behind him, he is still no slouch. Because he heard this story directly from Orson Welles (the two directors were very close friends) how exciting this movie could have been -- a cool little black comedy with an insider's cachet... but it's not. And lenser Bruno Delbonnel, who shot Amelie with such pizzazz, could have taken advantage of the challenge of shooting an entire film within the confines of cabins... but he didn't.I hate to be so catty, as I do truly like all the talent involved, but it's a shame The Cat's Meow could have been catnip -- as it is, it's just a catnap.The premiere was more lively; check out my interviews with the cast.  "},{"Title":"Good film, but not for the historically picky","Date":"14 April 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  Peter Bogdanovich's latest, The Cat's Meow, is a fun period piece that works on some levels, but fails on others.If you know very little about the period or the real life people involved, it's great.  It is well written, well directed, well paced and almost uniformly well acted.  It deals with a real life incident in 1924 that occured aboard William Randolph Hearst's yacht which cost the life of early silent film producer/director Thomas Ince.  The whole movie takes place aboard the yacht, so Bogdanovich got A picture production values on what was probably a B picture budget and his money was well spent, almost exclusively on the actors. None of them really fail him, in my view.So this comes off as a sort of Gosford Park in America, including the murder mystery.  It's not as well acted as Altman's film, but its close.So where are the problems?  For the most part, you won't find them, unless you know much about the people involved.  First, there's the casting. Kirsten Dunst plays Heart's long time mistress Marion Davies. The problem is, Dunst is 19, playing a woman who was atleast 27.  Joanna Lumley plays British novelist turned screenwriter Elinor Glyn.  Lumely must be in her 30s.  Glyn was 60 at the time.  Both give good performances, though, especially Dunst, who is extremely charming.But then there is Eddie Izzard as silent screen legend Charlie Chaplin.  In my book, Izzard fails to capture much of the charm or cleaverness that made Chaplin such a hit, with both audiences and with women.  He plays Chaplin like Robert Downey Junior -- on drugs.Then there's Hearst, played by the fine character actor Edward Herrmann. The intent here appears to have been NOT to portray Hearst as Orson Wells portrayed him in Citizen Kane.  But what Herrmann's Hearst comes off like is a kind of simp, a wildly erratic man who seems more like a manic depressive (big highs and big lows) than the absolute ruler of what at the time was the world's largest media empire.While I believe Hearst had an unusually high voice for a man, I don't think there was any evidence that he was the weak sister he comes off as in this film.  Finally, there's the concept that Marion Davis was not only cheating on Hearst with Chaplin, but apparently willing to do it almost openly, publicly humiliating the newspaper tycoon in front of his own guests.I think that flies in the face of most of what we know about Davies, who was no great shakes as an actress, but certainly no dummy. She would not have been willing to risk everything she had for a roll in the hay with Chaplin, a man who loved 'em and left 'em with regularity. But, assuming viewers know none of this to begin with, the picture works just fine and is really quite enjoyable.  It ends a little flat, and perhaps needed a little more drama there, but other than that, you can have fun with it. Just don't expect too much historial accuracy, if that's your thing.

It shows the power of Hollywood, and makes the new Hollywood, and involved seem like a midget compared to the power of money and the world during that time.  It was a super film, a great night out at the movies, with some great performances, and in particular Izzard's Chaplin, and Kirsten Dunst as Marion Davies. These were truly breakout performances for both Dunst, and Izzard, and for Izzard I can only pray for a wake up call for casting directors, this man can do anything!  Well worth your money, and popcorn.

Which, in effect, they did. It's indicative that Louella Parsons is the only real winner in the scandal, getting exactly what she wants. She is undoubtedly the comedy centrepiece of the movie, but has the last laugh - after all, she is there to tell the world what the world wants to know. It could be said that between herself and Hedda Hopper they held the reins in Hollywood. It's what the stars were doing off-screen that mattered most.There is, admittedly, much conjecture, and to-ing and fro-ing before we get anything really interesting, and for quite a while I felt like I was treading water. But the pay off is an unexpectedly good cast - Eddie Izzard giving a revelatory, and understated portrayal of Charlie Chaplin - and a workmanlike attention to detail. The evocation of the period is tangible.Definitely not for everyone, but certainly for anyone interested movies, their power and the unique culture of the Hollywood machine.

Based on a well-suppressed true story (first told to him by Orson Welles), The Cat's Meow relates the tale of a gathering on the yacht of William Randolph Hearst, to celebrate the birthday of Hollywood producer Thomas Ince.  Among the guests are Hearst's mistress Marion Davies (well played by Kristen Dunst), Charlie Chaplin, and notorious gossip columnist Louella Parsons.  As Chaplin tries to seduce Davies, tensions mount, and Ince winds up dead, changing the lives of everyone on board.The art and set direction in this film are exceptional; it's a real pleasure to look at, and the (supposed) reality of the story and characters make it a fascinating character study.

While some of the actors manage to give some life to their portrayals and give some life to the period (1920s), most of this tale stays dead in the water.Worst performance I have seen for a long time on the screen - Eddie Izzard as Charlie Chaplin.  Please.  Black hair, a bad haircut and brown contacts do not a complex comedy genius make.  An awful, inept, poor performance from an excellent comedian who has grown into a deeply disappointing actor.Kirsten Dunst is a looks-perfect but too young Marion Davies, who has none of the personality the real Miss Davies projected in her films such as Show People.  Cary Elwes is ok as Thomas Ince but that's about it, you can't imagine him being one of the driving forces of 1910s cinema.  Edward Herrmann I thought was good as Hearst until about the last third of the film where he went too over-the-top.  But you do get some sense of the jealousy and hunger for power which drove the newspaper magnate, even of his love for Marion (a love which incidentally lasted for many decades).Joanna Lumley is an interesting Elinor Glyn - the woman who coined the phrase 'It Girl'.  Elinor Glyn died eight years before William Randolph Hearst and yet she narrates this story and talks about what happened 'after the old man's death'.  These things may not matter to the main story but they are irritating.And was Louella Parsons really such a silly nitwit in her younger days before settling into her key role in the Hearst newspaper empire?  Jennifer Tilly would make you think so, and quickly outstays her welcome.The story itself is that old chestnut story about what caused the death of Thomas Ince in 1924 while on a trip for his birthday on Hearst's yacht.  Accompanied by his girlfriend, Margeret Livingston (played well by Claudia Harrison), and some irritating squealing women, he is hoping to strike a business deal with Hearst.  But things don't quite go to plan.'The Cat's Meow' is a turkey, only worth a mention for the good for its costumes and music (by far the highlight is Al Jolson's version of 'Avalon' as the opening credits roll).

The murder in `The Cat's Meow' is much less a mystery, and the William Randolph Hearst played by Edward Hermann is dull and lumbering by contrast with Welles' commanding magnate, Charles Foster Kane.  `The Cat's Meow' is like a bunch of flappers trying to amuse themselves intellectually on a desert island with no hope of escape.  It's uncreative and hopeless.History has it that in the 1920's someone died aboard Hearst's `Oneida'; of the many versions, this film depicts the whisper heard most often,' a tale of murder not quite so foul as foolish.A Hearst--Marion Davies-- Charlie Chaplin triangle is an intriguing possibility, but in the arthritic hands of Peter Bogdanovich, it seems more a Victorian stage cliché than a real-life romantic tumble. People skulk around the boat as if they were looking for a decent script, not to be found here.Kenneth Anger's `Hollywood Babylon' treated this scandal far more boldly but of course could not replicate the dark beauty of cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel. Just as the boat interior gives the requisite twist and turns for a mystery, the camera effortlessly tracks forward and back as if dancing with the actors. It is surprisingly lithe, yet the metaphorical `Charleston' awkwardly danced by the rioters is ironically cumbersome.Photography doesn't alone a movie make. This ship sank, cat and all.

What it is, in fact, is more of an off-white elephant with period, settings, etc, captured reasonably well and a hybrid of acting styles tending to clash more than they blend, the whole melange in aid of an unsolved crime dating back 80 years in which only any surviving relatives of the principals and the odd film buff and/or scholar could work up much of a sweat about. The facts are that in 1924 William Randolph Hearst hosted a cruise on his yacht on which gathered, in addition to Hearst himself and his mistress Marion Davies, Charles Chaplin, Elinor Glyn and William Ince, a well-known figure in the film circles of the time and who was to prove the victim of a bullet. Hearst had long been suspected of the homicide his motive being his obsessive jealousy in connection with the much younger Davies, fuelled by rumours that she and Chaplin were cuckolding Hearst. At this remove who cares but it does make for an entertaining story and Bogdanovich knows which end of the camera to point at the actors but that's about it.

It's just a good, catchy title, but has little to do with the actual story. The story is very simple, it is about tension that arises on William Randolph Hearst's cruise ship as it becomes obvious that Charlie Chaplin is making romantic overtures towards his young mistress, the actress Marion Davies. Hearst is very jealous and protective of his infatuation with the young actress, and in fact at that point in his life is his main reason for living, it is alleged. And, although she is flattered by the charms of womanizer Chaplin, it appears that her own alleigance is to Hearst.  In some ways this movie reminds me of Gosford Park, because the characters and their interactions are more important than the story itself, which here must be somewhat fictionalized, because no one really ever said what happened that night on the cruise ship. This movie presents one possibility which was later strongly rumored, and possibly true.Major SPOILERS follow, quit reading, OK!!The cruise was set up to honor Ince for his birthday. Ince was trying to get Hearst to bankroll him for future film projects. As the party winds up, and Chaplin becomes more forward in his affections for Davies, Hearst gets more and more upset. In the middle of the night while he has the wheel, Davies and Ince are sitting at the bottom of the stairs talking, Ince wearing a bowler hat like Chaplin's. Hearst has a gun and comes upon them, only hearing the last part of Davies' comment, ...I never really cared for him, in reference to Chaplin who she had just rejected.Thinking that she was talking about him, Hearst pointed the gun and shot, perhaps thinking he was shooting at Chaplin for stealing his girl, but in fact hitting Ince in the head.  The ship went to the nearest port, Ince was taken off and sent home, where he died the next day. His body was hastily cremated so that no autopsy could be done. All guests were asked to *not* talk about that night, and the death of Ince was explained as a sudden illness aboard ship.The DVD presentation is very nice, with interesting extras, including a vintage Chaplin film short.

Did Hearst, the portly, aging but still powerful newspaper and film tycoon fatally shoot a famous director, Thomas Ince.  Did Hearst mistake Ince for Charlie Chaplin who may have been having an affair with Hearst's personal arm candy, actress Marion Davies? Was there a coverup that has never been exposed? Who knows?Brilliantly portrayed by Edward Hermann, the Hearst of 1924 is not the dashing young publisher who truly deserves credit for getting the U.S. into war with Spain. He is not the man who upstaged soldiers in Cuba by personally taking the surrender of Spanish troops.  Nor is he the farsighted newspaper baron who revolutionized reporting in San Francisco and, later, New York. Hermann's Hearst never loses control but his focus is on being a gracious host and an adoring adulterer.In 1924 Hearst had many years ahead of him, his power was great but the object of his life was his mistress, the truly interesting Marion Davies, a woman who had both her paramour and, as shown in this film, her independence.  Kirsten Dunst shines in this role.  She may be making millions with Spider-Man but her finely nuanced portrayal of Davies shows her innate acting ability.Marion Davies in life and in this film refutes the casting couch metaphor for successful Hollywood actresses of her time.  Davies was shrewd, intelligent and strong-willed.  Her relationship with Hearst was based on, it seems, love as opposed to raw opportunism.  True, she seemed little concerned that her relationship was immoral to many and certainly illegal (not that a prosecution ever threatened the couple's very public life together).Marion Davies may or may not have had a fling with an adoring Charlie Chaplin, played by Eddie Izzard.  The problem with his role is that Chaplin is so indelibly familiar from his movies that it's hard to accept any actor's dramatic recreation of his somewhat shallow personal life.If Louella Parsons was still alive she'd be suing for defamation.  Wickedly played by Jennifer Tilly, Bogdanovich's Parsons, a young gossip columnist looking for a break, steers a fine line between immature social climbing and not so subtle blackmail.It would have been easy to show the married Hearst as a totally besotted oldster unable to deal with the reality of Davies's attraction to Chaplin.  To his credit, Bogdanovich and Hermann give us a complex, anguished and three-dimensional character.  He's more likable, really, than the other guests on what rapidly becomes a Ship of Fools.The background music ranges from Verdi to Puccini but with lots of Paul Whiteman, Charleston dances and Eddie Cantor.  As the credits rolled in a theater with a very good sound system, listening to Cantor belt out one of his signature songs, California Here I Come, was a great finish.This is a serious film, very well directed and acted.
