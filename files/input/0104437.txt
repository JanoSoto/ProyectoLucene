[{"Title":"Sequel Slightly Better","Date":"6 October 2006","Score":"19 out of 26 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":" Here's another example of the sequel being slightly better than the original, at least in my humble opinion. However, the original (Honey, I Shrunk The Kids) was nothing super, not something you'd call a classic. It was pretty good. This one is good. It had more laughs and less irritating kids. There is still the stupid teen romance, but not emphasized as much as in the first movie. The little kid in here, who is turned into a giant, is cute and affable and his giggle is fun to hear.The first 40 minutes of this film are the best. It gets a little too silly after that. At the end, Disney succumbs to the craze of the early '90s having a woman punch out a man. In this case, it was nice mother (Marcia Strassman.) Give me a break!The special-effects were okay but not totally convincing. In fairness, it's not easy trying to produce the effects of a 100-foot child walking down the streets of Las Vegas, but they've still come along way from the days of The Attack Of The 50- Foot Woman in 1958. However, there is still room for FX improvement.Overall, some good laughs in the film and - with one exception - likable characters.

Those who say that he runs around in a stupid King Kong or Godzilla like fashion are wrong. Does he eat anybody? No. Does he kill anybody? No. He is just a normal baby that has had an accident that most babies never have. He does break things, but that does not mean that he is a terror to society, or should be killed, or tranquilized. Moranis is excellent as his usual eccentric role in all three of these movies. Too bad the Szalinski's moved, because I liked the Thompsons from the original. I bet they either had to move because of Nick and Ron always at each others throats, or because Amy and Little Russ could never be parted. But it seems like Amy has forgotten all about Little Russ Thompson by now, because she just goes off to college with no regrets or worries. Bridges was good as Wayne's boss-totally different than his much earlier role as Harvey, the deputy, in the priceless classic, High Noon.

This sequel really isn't that bad, at this point I don't think it belongs in either of these categories but in a category titled a sequel that isn't as good as the original, but a sequel worth watching. It is very daft, even more dafter than Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, with a very silly final 20 minutes and the pacing at this point in the film isn't as strong as it was in the first 40 minutes, which was fun, fun, fun personified. Still, it is very entertaining for a number of reasons. It is nicely filmed, with a good soundtrack and some fun gags and physical comedy. But it was the performances that made it worthwhile. Rick Moranis reprises his role as Wayne and is immensely likable as always, and Marcia Strassman is great as Diane. Daniel and Joshua Shalikar are very cute as Adam, who has a nice, funny little laugh that doesn't grate, thank goodness. The other kids give appealing performances once again, the teen romance is evident here and is rather sappy, but hey I can live with that. Overall, for a sequel, this is really not bad. 7/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"King Baby!","Date":"9 April 2004","Score":"7 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":"  That affable, amiable, absent minded professor family man Wayne (Rick Moranis) is back, but now his experiments in size are funded by a big time company and he's a hot property.

As with the first film, Moranis brings a lot of energy to his role and Strassman still looks cute but the other kids and the nosy neighbors are missed. The plot line about Moranis' wacky boss just gets out of hand and by the time the action moves to Vegas, the whole plot becomes tiresome.

C'mon, it's not that bad! It's really simple, stupid and (of course) illogical, but denying that there's no absurd comedic moments (the baby is kind of funny!) and no funny scenarios (the teenagers being stuck in the toy car) seems bizarre to me.I loved this film as a kid. There were specials on the Disney Channel when it finally (after what seemed like forever) premiered on there, and it was a rather neat experience for an eight year old.In fact, I've watched this movie so many times as a kid that I've seen it a hell of a lot more than the unquestionably superior first movie. It was just one of those things.Watching it now, I'll admit that the special effects can be rather cumbersome and the lines are almost always pure cheeseball (Rick Moranis' especially). Also, Keri Russell's work here is absolutely terrible; after watching a lot of Felicity, I for some reason expected her to be at least near that quality. Not to mention the stupid villian who hits the baby with some projectile; very, very mock able.But it's a nice little dumb movie! Who cares! It's certainly not sequel hell, etc etc. It's entertaining at the very least.

Adam soon starts to grow to the height of over 100 feet, he is now heading toward Las Vegas, which he thinks is one big play land.........The first film was all about the effects and the dynamics between the shrunken kids. Moranis, as likable as he is, was just a name to sell the film with, after all, he's basically playing an intellectual Louis Tulley in this.But it was a huge hit, so it was inevitable that a sequel was given the green light, and while it was inevitable it wasn't going to be as good as the original, the concept is really good.It's basically King Kong as a gentle toddler, with Wayne trying to hide the fact that he's growing for a while, until it becomes obvious what is happening. This where the fundamental problem with the film lies, it doesn't know what to do when the toddler becomes gigantic, so we have Moranis doing all kinds of pratfalls around the animatronic baby parts, while his son is trying to woo Keri Russell.Lloyd bridges turns up near the end to fire the bad guy and mug at the screen, but it's the film loses its way halfway through, and even though it's predominantly an effects movie, it should care about the narrative a little.

That's good enough for me!","Date":"26 June 2012","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":" Many of you must remember the Wonderful World of Disney TV program in the '60's and '70s. In particular, you might remember some of the quasi-science fiction flicks starring a young Kurt Russell as high-school student Dexter. In high concept movies like The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes, The Strongest Man in the World, and Now You See Him, Now You Don't, Dexter would be subjected to wild, crazy plots where he would, respectively, gain super-intelligence, super-strength, and invisibility powers. The movies were not too sophisticated, logical, scientifically sound, or intellectual, but they were fast paced and fun. Disney's Honey, I... canon, especially Honey, I Blew Up the Kid (hereafter HIBUTK), would have been comfortably at home at Wonderful World of Disney.Basic and straightforward as the plot is, I won't bother going into TOO much detail about it - maybe. Wayne Szalinki's (Rick Moranis's) two-year old toddler son Adam(and his stuffed bunny) somehow accidentally gets into the path of the harried inventor's matter-sizing ray. But instead of shrinking to the size of an ant, the lively charmer gradually grows larger, especially when stimulated by electromagnetic currents. Despite Wayne's and his wife Diane's (Marcia Straussman's) efforts to conceal the mishap, Adam, the Amazing Colossal Baby, soon swells to skyscraper size and, naturally attracted to the pretty neon lights, lumbers towards Las Vegas. Wayne races against time and a smarmy corporate and professional rival (John Shea) to restore his son to normal without hurting him and save Las Vegas from his innocent destruction. Oh, before I forget, Wayne must also save his older son Nick and his would-be girlfriend,whom Adam has grabbed and put into his overall pocket.It's easy to find fault with HIBUTK. Overwrought characterizations, a non-dimensional villain, the impossibility of gigantism (Adam would have collapsed under his massive weight), occasionally dodgy special effects, yes they're all there. But c'mon people, HIBUTK is a fairly absorbing and suspenseful melding of the time-tested Giant Monster on the Loose and Raising a Cute Kid plots. It's also a fairly realistic portrayal of how a newly-enlarged child would react to his surroundings (everything is a toy) and the special, painstaking care the police and military have to employ to contain Adam safely. I also think director Randall Kleiser should receive credit for being able to work with the Shalikar twins (who alternately play Adam) and coax an engaging performance from them, and also not forgetting the tentative relationship growing between Nick and his girlfriend in spite of their predicament. Against the odds, HIBUTK works, and is even affecting. If you don't tear up a little when a misplaced fighter tranquilizer shot makes Adam cry and drop the enormous Hard Rock Cafe guitar sculpture he's strumming, well then, you're truly emotionless.But never fear, all Adam needs is a strong female figure to settle him down. Wayne's matter-sizer converts Diane into a 300-foot mama grizzly who gets Adam to sit still, and Wayne returns both to normal. Of course, we have a happy ending, and Adam has a 50-foot bunny to play with.Sometimes you have to bow to and enjoy the absurd. That's what I did with HIBUTK.

Wayne now works at a lab where his inventions are tested and used. It's headed by Dr. Hendrickson, an evil and vile person. Wayne's latest invention is an enlarging machine and it doesn't apparently seem to work.            Wayne wants to try the machine for himself, so he, Nick, and Adam go down to the lab and try the machine out on Adam's stuffed bunny, but Adam goes to retrieve it and the ray blasts both of them, but had no apparent effect. They go home and while Adam sits in the kitchen, the microwave is going, this causes Adam to grow six feet. Apparently it was electro magnetic fields cause him to grow because of the blast from the machine. Wayne and Nick must strategize. They sneak him back to the lab dressed as a badly dressed bee keeper. They couldn't shrink him back down because Dr. Hendrickson and his team were there.          And everytime Adam got near an electric machine that was on, he'd grow. He got so big, he broke out of the house and wandered around downtown Las Vegas, which could mean bad news. So Wayne, Diane, Wayne's boss Mr. Sterling, and Preston Brooks of the U.S Marshalls track down Adam in the Szalinski-mobile. Wayne had got his old shrink machine ready. Adam had put Nick and babysitter Mandy in his pocket and got even larger.           Diane suggests Wayne enlarge her because she figures Adam will listen to her.

The back projected scenes of the toddler stomping through the streets are integrated superbly with the actors and backdrops, as are the scenes when the toddler is a 'mere' seven foot tall. Back projection can sometimes look really obvious and cheesy, but never so here.Sadly, the film's storyline is a lot weaker. There's some initial set-up involving nutty scientists and the like, but once the kid starts growing it all falls by the wayside. Rick Moranis and Marcia Strassman, both returning from the original, have little to do other than chase around after their kid and act concerned, and there's a lot less of the camaraderie and high spirits from the first movie.

I can't believe that it wasn't nominated for an Oscar for those two categories. But if you liked that movie, you need to see Honey I Blew Up the Kid. Wayne Szalinsky is at it again, but this time, he's created a machine that makes things grow and he accidentally made his toddler son, Adam, grow until he's the size of a skyscraper! The cast is the same, but now Lloyd Bridges, John Shea, and Keri Russell have been added into the mix. The acting was good, the special effects were even better than the first movie, and there's laughs and plot twists around every corner! To the people who don't think that this movie was good, sometimes you just have to pretend your a kid again in order to get the whole gist of the movie. And I don't say that with every kid's movie (especially not ones with mediocre CGI animation and potty jokes/language, like the crap we have nowadays), but this one is free of all of those nasty movie plagues, making this movie a rare treasure and one of the best sequels I have ever seen! I never get tired of watching it, and I hope that once you see it, you won't either!

This sequel to the B-fantasy movie hit Honey,I Shrunk the Kids has a lesser formula compared to its predecessor, but it's still quite enjoyable, most especially for the kiddies. This sequel has Rick Moranis inventing another machine which, this time, makes things grow rather than shrinking. Well, accidentally, he blows up his baby to giant size. Moranis makes things funny, and the special-effects are great. Mostly, without Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna doing the writing job, it's mostly B-movie in style of the cult, camp movie Attack of the 50-foot Woman, only this one has a kid.Its kinda fun for those boring nights, wherein you have nothing to do and mostly nothing to watch. It's not as much fun as the first, but as old-fashioned Disney movies go, this one ain't half bad. Rating *** out of 5.

I have the book, that has pictures from the movie, and it is practically the same.The same actors from the first movie, minus the Thomsons, come back and they have a new addition to the family. Adam is a two-year old mischief maker who can get out of almost everything. The Szalinskis have moved to Las Vegas, and have a bigger house. Still, the place is often a mess.Wayne has a new invention, a machine that enlarges matter, instead of shrinking it. But when an experiment goes awry, Adam is enlarged. The problem gets worse when he keeps growing due to a electromagnetic fuse. (or something like that) One of Wayne's fellow employees, Charles Hendrickson, is a typical villain. He wants to take credit for everything Wayne does, and almost gets away with it. Fortunately, h'es fired by his boss, Clifford Sterling. But that doesn't stop Charles. He later tries to take Adam away from his family to undergo tests, but Adam is eventually shrunk back down to two feet.What could have been a better movie was a major disappointment.My Score 5/10.

And each scene of peril is highlighted with corny, clichéd one-liners that only a four-year-old would deem funny, such as--oh, look, we're being thrown to our death in this car. I sure hope it has airbags! Jesus. When any sane person would be screaming, these creepy lines are popping up by the second. It's just goofy, unbelievable, and stupid. Don't waste your time.

This time, the professor builds a machine that makes objects larger, and you can see the direction that this film is going in.I found this film to be more geared to adults. The previous film was all about the children, but this film is about the parents and their baby. It's also not a funny film, but it tries to be funny. The characters also seem far removed from the previous film; I was expecting to see the same characters that I enjoyed watching in the original.The film takes on the approach of the baby as Godzilla or King Kong. I suppose that this had to be a baby because the older children are more reasonable and know what they are doing, but a baby cannot comprehend on this level. I think this is the fault of the whole film. It's really not a film that children are going to want to see. (Children don't like babies because it is a big responsibility, with no pun intended.) The characters just are not believable or particularly engaging, and the story lacks substance. I would not recommend it because I think it fails to captivate a majority of the audience and the intended audience.

However, a chain of events causes his 2 children to shrink, and his neighbor's kids to shrink. The adventure currently holds a rating of 6.2 on IMDb and is considered the best of the series.Skip ahead a few years. the family has since moved to Vista Del Mar, Nevada from Fresno, and a lot has changed. Nick is now a teenager, Amy is off to college, and Wayne and Diane have another child - Adam. While the shrink ray worked, Wayne Szalinski (A hard name to spell) Is working on a ray that can enlarge matter and thus perhaps bring an end to world hunger. However, the project is no longer in his attic, it's in a high-tech laboratory, and the project is supervised by a scientist who thinks he's better than everyone else. One day while working on the project without the lab's permission, Wayne attempts to enlarge his son Adam's stuffed bunny, but while busy with the computers, Adam gets in the way of the laser, and slowly over time, becomes bigger, eventually to the size of a building.To be honest, I like this one over the first one. I guess the premise of a ginormous baby hasn't been done before and no one's done it since. But the real reason I love this one? A Teenage Keri Russell in a pink bikini. Hey, I was 4 years old when I first saw this, so it's totally innocent! even at almost 40 years old (Or older considering this review is being re-written in 2014) Keri still looks incredible in a bikini.For a sequel, this is one you might want to check out. it's by no means a horrible movie, but at least it wasn't the 3rd and final movie of the series - Honey we shrunk ourselves. that one was pathetic.8/10 "},{"Title":"I Wish They Had Blown Up the Negatives to the Film.","Date":"30 May 2005","Score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":" Another sleeping pill that doubles as a family picture for those without discriminating tastes. The terrible title is only the start of a whole list of problems in this smelly sequel to Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. Mad scientist Rick Moranis accidentally turns his toddler son (the unbelievably hard to look at Daniel & Joshua Shalikar) into a giant that keeps growing and growing thanks to electronic pulses from appliances. It is as hopeless as it sounds. Anyway the youth starts to grow and grow as the audience's interest shrinks and shrinks and soon he is on his way to the Las Vegas strip. Basically a remake of Attack of the 50 Foot Woman and other wastes from the 1950s that were little more than interesting special effect yarns. Nothing unsuitable for wide audiences except for the fact that the picture is a critical dud. Lloyd Bridges is wasted as Moranis' silly boss. Watch for a young Keri Russell in a prevalent part. 2 stars out of 5.

The first one was more original, while this one just copies and copies. Wayne builds a machine that can blow up things now(make them bigger). His baby boy just happens to step in it's way. The son takes over the town like a Godzilla movie. That's pretty much it. I was also disappointed. I really wished they had brought the neighbors back from the first one.

Years after the events of Honey, I Shrunk The Kids, he's still tinkering with new inventions, the latest of which, enlarges -- rather than shrinks -- it's targets. After losing control of his own project, he inadvertently enlarges his toddler son, resulting in plenty of bad green-screen effects and illogical plot-holes. The youngest Szalinski grows to be over 150 feet tall and makes his way to Las Vegas, only to match wits with Lloyd Bridges, Bill Moseley and Keri Russell, to name a few.What can be expected of a sequel to Honey, I Shrunk The Kids? The answer Not much. Admittedly, this movie was enjoyable when I dragged my family to see it in theaters as a wee-lad, but now, upon a much-delayed second viewing on outdated VHS, I can safely say that this film just doesn't live up to the clever and just plain fun spirit of it's predecessor. Truth be told, it's -- as the summary suggests -- a glorified b-movie. Entertaining only to see Rick Moranis do his thing and to say Hey, look! It's Bill Chop-Top Moseley! Even without taking it too seriously, it's not even fun to mock. Like most Disney sequels, it's hollow, soul-less and is just barely entertaining. As much fun as it is to re-visit long lost movies of our childhood, this one fails to hold up. At the very least, it's better than the third film that followed in it's wake, but certainly a glimpse into some of the mindless entertainment that the 90's provided for it's children. Unfortunately, a lot of the worst movies from that era chose babies as their subject matter.

It's not that anything depressing happens in the film, it's just a depressing film.

Idiotic but nice scientist Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) has secured a deal with the Sterling company who have replicated his shrinking machine. He has also had another kid with wife Diane (Marcia Strassman), two-year-old Adam (twins Daniel and Joshua Shalikar). Basically the scientists are having trouble getting their machine to work the same way Wayne's did, and Wayne wants to prove it is not just for shrinking. Unfortunately when Adam's favourite toy, Big Bunny is put in front of the machine, Adam joins him when it is activated. Now Adam is slowly growing whenever he is close to an electrical appliance or source. Wayne, along with Diane and son Nick (Robert Oliveri) are trying everything they can to not only get Adam back to normal size, but keep him still and behaved. You think Godzilla is bad when he terrorises New York or whatever, well see 100-feet Adam stomping through the lights of Las Vegas.

The Szalinski family moved to Las Vegas and has got a new offspring a little boy called Adam which is into the center of the movie. This time, he hasn't shrunk due to Wayne Szalinski's carelessness, he blew up and once again due to Szalinski's fault. This last one must find a way to make him shrink to his normal seize.If honey, I shrunk the kids was a pleasant but rather conventional movie, Honey, I blew up the kid appears devoid of interest. The movie suffers from a serious lack of originality. The screenplay is labored and doesn't avoid a quite important number of clichés. Some of them are linked to Szalinski who epitomizes the model of the crazy learned. As a consequence, his odd habits make people distant and mistrustful towards him. But you also find clichés with the tender relationship between Adam Szalinski and his mother who'll discover the way to save her son. But the movie contains many topics that have been used until it's threadbare by plenty of American movies Nick's desire to go out with a girl, Szalinski's manager who tends to despise himHoney, I blew up the kid is a flat and predictable follow-up who introduces the same faults as the first movie.
