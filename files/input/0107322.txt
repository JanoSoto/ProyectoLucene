Jesse Bradford is simply phenomenal and so is Adrian Brody, yes him, the kissing pianist in a remarkable early performance. The face of Karen Allen, as the teacher, listening to Jesse Bradford read his tall tale, profoundly aware that she has someone truly special in her class, is so beautiful that goes in an out of my memory bank more often than the names of some of my closest relatives.

The subtlety of the performances and the evocative production design pull you into the carefully constructed world of Aaron Kurlander, building the right level oh humour and drama, and never allowing it's self to become bogged down with tacky sentimentality.  Steven Soderbergh really out-did himself with this one, and it's by far the best thing he's done, you can forget the overrated, over-hyped Oscar nabbing rubbish of Traffic, this showed a young director willing to experiment with tried and tested film-making techniques and find the right visual language for the film. King of the Hill is a film that is so deliberately paced, and so elegantly put together, that at times it's as though your not watching an American film at all, there is such a European atmosphere that it seems out of place with some of the other U.S. film released in the same year (Jurassic Park, Mrs Doubtfire and Cliffhanger being just three of the top grossing movies of &#145;93).   So is it any wonder that King of the Hill failed to set the box office alight with popcorn based seat fillers like that, I mean, who wants to see the story of a young boy coming of age under the harshest conditions when you can see Robin Williams vacuuming in drag to the sounds of Aerosmith.  Yeah, sounds like a safe bet for all the family.  But King of the Hill is such a good movie, that the hard-to-describe plot should be overlooked, and people should just give it a chance, they will be so moved by Aaron's plight, and so drawn in by Soderbergh's direction (coupled with Elliot Davis' composition heavy cinematography) and detailed production design that they will not be able to pull themselves away.  Added to that the great acting from the entirety of the eclectic cast, that includes Jeroen Krabbe, Spalding Grey, Elizabeth McGovern, Karen Allen, new comers Jesse Bradford and Cameron Boyd, and (then) unknowns Adrien Brody (who was great as Ritchie in Spike Lee's Summer of Sam) and Roswell star Katherine Heigl.  Soderbergh's handling of his young actors is nothing short of genius, their characters and characterization is multi-layered to the extent that we never doubt that their characters are real.   King of the Hill is an unbelievable film that, as I have already said, is (in my opinion) the greatest American film of the nineties and should be seen by everyone who is a fan of not just intelligent cinema, but film lover's in general.  And it's about time the film got some kind of proper video and/or DVD release, as it's unavailability is scandalous.  10/10  "},{"Title":"Great Film","Date":"24 January 2004","Score":"26 out of 31 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, History","Review":"  I first rented King Of The Hill (1993) back in 1994 and was delightfully surprised at the great quality of the film.

King of the Hill is one of the most vivid film experiences I remember as a child. No, I wasn't lucky enough to catch it on the big screen. Instead I rented it and watched it one night and was totally absorbed into it. Jesse Bradford, despite his current film career, did a damn fine job as Aaron Kurlander, a young boy struggling to survive during the Great Depression. He uses his wits and imagination to make the best out of the worst of times. Bradford was 12 or 13 years old at the time he filmed the movie and as an actor it must've been a heavy burden. The main focus is on him as its his story and shown from his point of view. Bradford doesn't let the ball drop once and more than carries his weight. It's another one of those rare great child performances. Jeroen Krabb√© plays Aaron's (Bradford) father who is a struggling traveling salesman. Lisa Eichhorn plays his mentally unstable mother who goes in and out of various institutions. Rounding out the cast of the interesting people that fill Aaron's life are Karen Allen as the warm and understanding school teacher, Cameron Boyd his younger brother, Adrien Brody as the cool big brother figure, John McConnell as the fat and troublesome patrol cop, Elizabeth McGovern as a prostitute working in the same hotel Aaron lives at, and Spalding Gray as her creepy, manipulative, and suicidal pimp. So yes the film is filled to the brim with worth while supporting players adding so much depth and dimension to Aaron's world.Soderbergh had double duty as writer and director. He scripted the novel by A.E. Hotchner and I think it's his best film. As I mentioned it takes place during the Great Depression in St. Louis Missouri. Watching Aaron fight for survival is one of the best charms of the film. It's done realistically. The audience is able to believe his methods. There's a nice mix of drama, dark somber humor and dire situations, but there's also enough humanity and hope in the movie to send an uplifting message. For those who enjoy Andy Dufresne's message of hope and persaverence in the more widely known The Shawshank Redemption, seek out this film. I would argue it's even superior to Frank Darabont's movie. It's one of the great and underrated modern films and ranks with the best using the Great Depression setting. Sadly King of the Hill isn't released yet on DVD and it's not very likely that you'll be able to find it at your local video store. Especially if all you have is the local communist Blockbuster near you. Anyway, King of the Hill should be regarded and known far more highly than what it is. It's a sin for a movie this great to not get its due.

I was totally enthralled by the story, and this was one of the pieces that ushered in my complete love for and eerie obsession with Depression Era America.Steven Soderbergh as a director over the years has been wildly all over the map traversing genres and styles from top-notch cracker-jack indie flicks (the superb Limey) to vapid star-studded populist entertainment (the Oceans series) to entertaining star vehicles (the excellent Erin Brockovich) to overblown misguided message movies (Traffic) to Kubrickian quandaries (the unfairly maligned Solaris). In 1993, still in his formative early years, he hit all the right notes with his vividly detailed and heartbreaking tale of a young boy (Bradford) abandoned in a sleazy hotel room on the edge of a Hooverville in 1933 St. Louise by his flaky salesman father, consumption riddled mother, and little brother who got shipped off to live with relatives so he wouldn't starve to death. The boy lies, steals, woos girls and wins academic awards at school propelled only by his keen wit and innate will to survive. Soderbergh brilliantly abandons almost all sentimentality (the exchanges between the brothers are heartfelt but raw, between mother and son tragically subdued, and between father and son frightfully cold yet honest) and views not the actions of the characters through the lens of our modern moral codes, but through the lens of the era in which the characters survived.Special note has to be given to the cinematography, which in lesser period pieces can so easily succumb to stylish excess. The film looks real and puts you right there in the middle of this American quagmire. There's also one amazingly rendered shot of a traffic cop holding up a squealing street urchin by the ear after capturing the boy stealing an apple that is so painstakingly lighted and framed that it serves as the complete flip-side of your classic Norman Rockwell painting from the same era.Viewing this film recently on cable, I was even more transfixed than the first time over thirteen years ago. There's also delight to be found in seeing Oscar winner Adrien Brody in his first major role as Aaron's big brother role model, and Grammy winner Lauryn Hill in a nice bit part as a sympathetic gum-chewing elevator operator.Although historically little seen, this film has been universally lauded, and as the early masterwork of an Oscar winning director, it's a crime that there has been no DVD release.

Although the hotel-dwelling salesman living on the edge of subsistence is not a new theme, any more than that of the capable child flourishing in adversity, Soderberg brings a timeless quality and a steady, gentle mood to this piece, making it more about the hearts of the people than the tragic times which are displayed.

I agree with other comments it hardly seems American because it is so deep without smashing the hammer down on our heads.

Hotchner's memoirs, writer/director Steven Soderbergh's 1993 adaptation of KING OF THE HILL (KofH) is the poignant, often dark, but ultimately uplifting story of 12-year-old Aaron Kurlander (Jesse Bradford, who comes across as sensitive and resilient at the same time), whose family struggles to get by in St. Louis, Missouri during The Great Depression. Like many of their neighbors, the Kurlanders can barely hold onto their cheap, shabby hotel room, though they do their best to find work and keep up a facade of doing well. Aaron contributes to the charade by telling his classmates wild yet convincingly-told stories of the glamor of his parents' lives as spies and archaeologists hobnobbing with the likes of Charles Lindbergh. Despite the Kurlanders' best efforts, they're slowly pulled apart when Aaron's traveling salesman dad (Jeroen Krabbe) can't make enough money to feed everyone. Soon Aaron's little brother Sullivan (the appealing Cameron Boyd, who looks strikingly like a little-boy version of the Olsen twins back in their FULL HOUSE days) is sent to live with relatives for the time being; Mom (Lisa Eichhorn) has TB, eventually going to a sanitarium; and finally Dad finds a job as a traveling watch salesman in Oklahoma, leaving Aaron to fend for himself and dodge the mean hotel porter to keep from being locked out of the family's apartment.Aaron tries all kinds of money-making schemes so he can bring his family back home, but it seems like God or Fate or whoever is in charge of KotH's universe insists on bitch-slapping the kid every step of the way. A rich, sympathetic classmate (who doesn't know Aaron's broke because our hero is too proud to admit it) gives Aaron canaries to breed in order to sell them to the pet shop, but when the canaries are born, they're all female, and female canaries don't sing, so all Aaron can get is 50¬¢ for the lot of them. A pre-PIANIST Adrien Brody, about 19 or 20 during filming, is a raffish presence as Lester, the juvenile delinquent down the hall with a heart of gold and a brotherly attitude towards Aaron. Lester tries to include the kid in jobs such as caddying for rich golfers, but Aaron tees them off by losing the ball in the ball-washing doohickey. Aaron tries to be kind to their neighbor Ella (Amber Benson), a sickly but sweet young girl, but that backfires when she gets so nervous dancing with him that she has an epileptic fit. When Aaron gets a medal during his graduation ceremony (nice bit with Lester there to cheer as Aaron's name is called, what with the Kurlanders being scattered all over the country), even that bit of joy is snatched from him as he overhears jealous classmates whispering that he only got the medal because the school authorities know he's poor and feel sorry for him (yeah, it couldn't possibly be because Aaron gets the best grades and writes imaginative stories and essays that blow those over-privileged brats out of the water).Over the course of KotH, just about everyone Aaron cares about is either sent away, moves away, dies, or gets arrested. Jeez, if it wasn't one thing, it was another! Interestingly, it seems like every time Aaron has an emotional upheaval, the film becomes more beautiful to look at, thanks to Elliot Davis' golden-hued photography, and yet the film's beauty doesn't cheapen or sentimentalize the painful events our young hero must live through. Aaron and the film's other good guys are kind-hearted, unself-pitying, and earnest enough that I was rooting for them even as I groaned to myself, Good grief, isn't this poor kid ever gonna catch a break? Much like the final reel of THE PIANIST, when the resourceful Aaron's plans to reunite his family finally succeed and life becomes good again, it's as much of a relief to us viewers as it is to the Kurlanders. Soderbergh's adaptation of Hotchner's life story often slathers the misery on so thick, I was still afraid something else might go horribly wrong for our beleaguered hero at the last minute. (For instance, as little brother Sullivan jumps up and down on his new bed, I half-expected him to accidentally bounce off the bed and break his neck. Don't worry, he doesn't. -)). I came away with the feeling that Aaron would never again take the good things in his life for granted. The delicate balance of drama and humor in Soderbergh's fine writing and direction, as well as superb acting from an ensemble that also includes Spalding Gray, Elizabeth McGovern, Karen Allen, and Lauryn Hill -- yup, that Lauryn Hill (who later appeared with Brody in the 1998 indie drama RESTAURANT) -- makes KotH a little gem well worth seeking out on TV, especially since it's still not on DVD but has been on the HBO and Cinemax lineups lately as of this writing. If you like fact-based stories about young people overcoming obstacles, or if you want to catch folks like Brody, Bradford, or a very young Katherine Heigl in memorable early roles, check out KotH.

Stand by Me led to the TV series The Wonder Years (1988) which led to Woody Allen's Radio Days, Brighton Beach Memoirs, Man in the Moon (1991), Radio Flyer (1992), Jack the Bear (1993), This Boys Life (1993), Searching For Bobby Fisher (1993), King of the Hill, American Heart, Now and Then (1995), Unsung Heroes (1995), The Mighty (1998), Simon Birch (1998) etc.These films all employed a romantic visual style which recalled the paintings of Norman Rockwell. They featured older and wiser narrators who reminisced about their childhood days, revolved around small groups of young boys, largely took place in the 1960s and early 70s, and oozed a sense of nostalgia.Essentially, these films were also about the same thing escape. These kids (or rather their future adult/narrator selves) are all searching for a romanticised version of America. A forgotten - or perhaps nonexistent - age of white picket fences, carefree wandering, pop sodas and family dinners. Behind all this comfortable nostalgia, though, is a palatable sense of menace. Abuse, suicide, murder, the lingering effects of the Vietnam war and drunken fathers, all linger in the background. This trend started in the 1980s, by artists who were born post WW2 and became young men in the turbulent 60s. By the late 1990s the unseen enemy of these films stopped being about war, poverty, absent fathers, abuse and alcoholism, and started to be about disease and genetic disorders. Though fading, the idealised Norman Rockwell version of Americana was still there, but now Generation X seemed to obsess over diseases and genetics. For Generation X, misery seemed to be all about ailments and genetic predisposition, like the kids with Morquio's syndrome in The Mighty and Simon Birch or AIDS in The Cure.King of the Kill, a little known film by Steven Soderbergh, is however quite different from all the other films in this wave. Directed by a young man, the film is set in St Louis during the Great Depression, and focuses on a young school boy called Aaron who uses his wits to survive the economic hardships of 1930's America.An imaginative and creative boy, Aaron must survive on his own when his father abandons him, his mother is locked away in a mental hospital and his little brother is sent off to boarding school. Initially Aaron takes to these dilemmas with strong shoulders, but gradually his harsh world begins to suffocate him. He has no food, he's in constant fear of losing his apartment and is mocked by his classmates for being poor. Every misery and mishap imaginable seems to happen to Aaron, but the film, despite being shot in sepia hues, never becomes maudlin or implausible. Soderbergh lets the film unfold like Truffaut, mixing tragedy with a very sensitive, deft touch. Now at first glance the film seems to be celebrating resilience, creativity and that good ole American Spirit. Indeed, the film begins with Aaron reading a story he wrote about Charles Lindberg and the Spirit Of St Louis, the first man and plane to cross the Atlantic. Aaron, like Charles, is a symbol of heroism, persistence, national pride and creativity, a man/boy who triumphs despite the odds.But look closer and something darker seems to be going on. Aaron thinks up a genius scheme to sell birds to make money, but his birds are the wrong sex and aren't worth anything. Aaron then schemes to find the perfect clothes for a school function (in which he wins a top prize), but despite succeeding is teased by his classmates. Aaron, starving and hungry for food, then has enough imagination to cut out pictures of food from a book, but when he eats them, gets sick the following day. Likewise, Aaron is promised food at a restaurant, but the manager refuses the deal and callously turns him away.Now think back to Aaron's scheme to breed birds and sell them for their money. Aaron takes the birds to a pet store and attempts to sell them, at which point the store owner tells him the birds are worthless because of their sex. Aaron agrees and walks away, the camera lingering suspiciously on the store owner for a moment. In an instant we know that this boy is being taken advantage of, and that the store owner stands to gain far more than the boy will.The end result is that the Spirit of St Louis is not celebrated, but shown to be the cause of hardship. For one to triumph, another must suffer. For the poor man in the shop to make money, he must rip off a little kid. For a restaurant owner to stay in business, a poor boy must go hungry. In other words, The Great American Spirit is itself a selfish, debased thing, a grand cycle of victors triumphing over others. This, of course, flies in the face of the doctrines and myths espoused by every free-market fundamentalist, despite being backed up by every post neoclassical economist who charts the thermodynamic properties of debt-issued currency. Currency, by the way, is Soderbergh's unacknowledged obsession (The Girlfriend Experience, Side Effects, Contagion, Che, Magic Mike, the Ocean movies etc).8/10 &#x96; Worth one viewing.

In even his more mainstream movies, he's distinguished. He's one of the few (relatively) young directors that makes real movies (not to knock the fake ones) about a wide array of subjects. He doesn't need to be cool or ambiguous all the time.Set in St. Louis in 1933, King of the Hill is like a light kids version of The Pianist (it's even got Adrien Brody!). The film centers around the 12 year-old Aaron Kurlander, and his family -- his mother, father, and younger brother, Sullivan. The Depression is in full force, and Aaron's parents have come to the agreement that the only way to save money and be able to continue raising their two sons is to have young Sullivan shipped off on a Greyhound bus to live with his uncle. Soon thereafter, Aaron's mother is taken out of the picture when she has to go for a stay at a sanitarium. The family lives in a hotel run by a bank, and Aaron's father isn't paying the bills; soon he's out of the picture when he goes off looking for work, leaving Aaron on his own to fend for himself.He makes friends with a rich nerdy kid at school when he rescues him from some school marble bullies, and comes up with schemes of how to make money, like having canary's mate, since a newborn will fetch three dollars. He spins tall tales in order to get by at school, like telling his teacher that his parents work for the government. His hunky, older pal also living in the hotel, Lester (Adrien Brody) helps him about; in one incident they end up stealing Aaron's father's car, and with Aaron too small to be able to reach the brake pedal, he ends up going on a scary trip around town.When one girl from school invites him over for supper, he gets caught in his own web of deceit when the school kids, at an after-graduation party where Aaron wins a special prize, hear different stories about what his parents really are. (Government workers, archaeologists, pilots.) At the same party, he's exposed for what (they think) he is a poor kid and a teacher's pet.He befriends a gawky girl in his hotel with a crush on him when she invites him over for hot dogs and dancing, but ends up having some sort of fit on the floor. (Epileptic seizure?)The cop out in the street is just looking to bust some young punk kid, and the hotel bellhop is just waiting for Aaron to slip up, so he can lock him out of his room. (Look fast for Lauryn Hill as the hotel elevator operator!)The movie looks great, both in the set deco and the juicy, round cinematography. The music is a plus, and nearly all the performances are first-rate. Jesse Bradford, with his big, expressive eyes, is just terrific as Aaron. He's got an ultra-pleasant face to watch, and his acting is totally fresh, without any hint of affectation. (Unlike his father's strange accent.)King of the Hill is a lovely, great-looking period piece. A sometimes heartwarming, sometimes heartbreaking dramedy without any pretensions to be anything other than a good little gem of a movie. And that it is.**** "}{"Title":"Hauntingly beautiful drama","Date":"30 May 2002","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, History","Review":"    Saw this years ago in 1994, but I still remember vividly the musicalscore, especially at that searing moment when Jeroen Krabbe gets intohis car, talks to his son on the street and tells him a story.

He was only 14 when he did this and he's GREAT! He anchors the film and is believable every step of the way. Also look for an unknown Katherine Heigl and future Oscar winner Adien Brody in small roles. This was a hard movie to market and the studio didn't even try. It died pretty quickly.

The same Soderbergh who would become one of the most innovative and versatile directors of 90s and 2000s American cinema? The film, however, is encumbered by corny music, cheap sentimentality, and bad special effects. I don't know much about the production, but if I had to guess I'd say that these discrepancies are not the work of Soderbergh, but the studio behind him. Soderbergh was, after all, a fresh faced Independent director looking to find his footing, and landing in Universal Studios. It wouldn't be the first case of studio intervention in 90s Independent Cinema - specifically the early 90s, when Independent Cinema was still on the rise and didn't have the strength it had after the success of films like Clerks, Pulp Fiction, etc. (but before the late 90s and subsequent failure of various studio funded films by Independent directors). Universal Studios in particular is notorious for its intervention. I'd like to refer readers to the case of Terry Gilliam's Brazil. Where the film succeeds, it triumphs. The performance of young Jesse Bradford (in the lead); supporting performances by Spalding Gray, Karen Allen, and a young Adrian Brody; masterful adaptation and direction by Steven Soderbergh...

King of the Hill is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen, it's an old-fashioned film made in a modern style.

There are so many wonderful moments in the film, Aaron's game of marbles, Lester (Adrian Brody) trying to hide the car, the final scenes before Sullivan makes his way home. Add to that a great cast (Bradford, Adrien Brody, Jeroen Krabbe, Karen Allen, Spalding Gray etc) and you have one of the best films of the nineties.Everything about the film sticks in the mind long after the first time you see it. In full, King of the Hill is a poetic and moving, coming of age drama that gets better with each viewing, a fantastic drama from a one of American cinema's truly talented film-makers.

The more circumstances place him on the narrowest margins of life, the more he bears down.Summarizing King Of The Hill is much less easy than simply enjoying it. Taken from the memoir of A. E. Hotchner, King Of The Hill is not so much a single story but a series of vignettes involving Aaron's experiences during the spring and summer of 1933. The pictures are often beautiful, sunlight streaming everywhere without a cloud in the sky, but you always see the sweat on the faces.As Aaron tells his younger brother Sullivan (Cameron Boyd) All the important stuff can't be taught. It has to be learned.For Aaron, this means faking it. A lot. The movie opens with him in a fancy public school where he isn't supposed to be, reading aloud his tale of receiving a phone call from Charles Lindbergh just before the latter's solo flight across the Atlantic. Later, he tells Sullivan how not to get in trouble when filching meals from more advantaged classmates. I told you a thousand times, you only take food from the fat kids, and you never take a kid's dessert.All this could be grim material in another director's hands, but Steven Soderbergh applies a delicate touch throughout, aided by the sterling lenswork of Eliot Davis and a beguiling score (by Cliff Martinez and Michael Glenn Williams) mixed with some understated period music.Everything is understated in King Of The Hill. There are some rotten characters about, like a bullying cop and a nasty bellhop at the poorly-named Empire Hotel, which is in the process of tossing their many indigent tenants out. But most of the people Aaron meets, even the rich ones, are decent. A well-heeled boy named Billy (Chris Samples) shows Aaron how to make some money breeding canaries, while his teacher (Karen Allen) does what she can to help Aaron despite knowing he lives outside her district.In the excellent DVD package put out by Criterion, Soderbergh expresses some dissatisfaction with King Of The Hill, wishing he had made it grittier. I doubt the film would be such a sleeper for so many had it taken a harder approach. We see Aaron alone in his apartment, in fear of being locked out (his often-absent father owes $172 he can't pay), making due with a meal from pictures of food cut out of a magazine, while outside the streets roar with the din of policemen tearing down a nearby Hooverville. You need the humor and the beauty to cut away from that and give us a window into Aaron's fertile, optimistic mind.Bradford is brilliant and affecting in the lead role, aided by a colorful supporting cast that includes Spalding Gray as a mysterious, down-on-his-luck man across the hall; Adrien Brody as Aaron's streetwise pal; and Amber Benson as a sickly neighbor named Ella who nurses a crush on Aaron, who tries to be nice but isn't yet interested in such things. Even rap star Lauryn Hill is on hand as an elevator operator, and a pre-teen Katherine Heigl, too, as a well- off classmate whom Aaron tries to impress with stories of his parents being lost on an archaeology expedition.They've been lost lots of times, Aaron says, trying to tamp down her responsive anxiety, in a scene that might be more tragic if it wasn't so funny. There are glimmers of hope in this bleak vision, but even the ending leaves you feeling more unsettled than reassured. There are no easy answers in the world Aaron lives in, just a precious will to endure.The lack of a central, unifying story makes King Of The Hill a challenge to enjoy as thoroughly as one might, and there's sometimes a patness to the way good and bad things happen for Aaron. But overall, King is triumphant, and a film that stays with you when it is over.

For instance, the 1930s Depression-era setting of this film is done very self-consciously, very modernly, very cleanly, so that it is plainly apparent that this is a staged production, not an attempt to recreate flawlessly the appearance of 1930s Missouri.  In addition, all of actors, especially the young teen actors, come across in a very self-assured and clean manner.  There is an on-stage or theatrical feel to the quality of their acting that makes the whole thing seem more theater than real life.  Cliff Martinez has his hands in the soundtrack of King of the Hill and I have always been fond of his ambient musical genius.  And Soderbergh flirts with flashback techniques which make some of his later films, like The Limey, so interesting.  But like so many of Soderbergh's films, I came away from King of the Hill with an unsatisfied feeling.  I just didn't know what to make of it  It's sort of like an on-stage production, but it also flirts with real life-type conflicts.  It's like two different styles of film that don't belong together.  And if it was supposed to be a more real life-type film, then the self-assuredness, theatricality, and cleanness of most of the characters behavior and appearance did not work for me.

Conventionally, the rites-of-passage concerns the traumas and awakenings of a seemingly isolated young individual as he or she takes his or her place in ordered society.  KING OF THE HILL follows the opposite movement, the existential journey of a family son to an awareness of his own solitude.Like most rites-of-passages, this movie offers an episodic narrative over a single plot.  1933 Aaron Kurlander is a bright and imaginative pupil at a public school for rich kids.  His once wealthy parents suffered during the Depression, and now live in a dismal hotel where bellboys in the banks' pocket skulk in corridors waiting to throw out those who can't afford to pay their rent.  Aaron lies about his social position to save face, but his father is a failed candle salesman, and his mother is a consumptive, and they must send Aaron's little brother to stay with a remote uncle.Increasingly deserted by his family - his mother goes to a sanitarium, his father gets a job as a travelling watch salesman in distant States - and neighbours - who are being thrown out of their rooms - Aaron is forced to live by his wits, helped only by an older friend, Lester, a petty criminal.  He goes through the usual adolescent adventures - taunting policemen, driving an out-of-control car, conducting a tentative relationship with a strange, epileptic girl - and tests of masculine courage (in rites such as marbles), but these only serve to alienate him further from his peers.  His only remaining neighbour is a formerly wealthy businessman turned pimp, trying to keep an air of resigned gentility.  One day Aaron gets a note saying that his father has three days to pay their rent or they must leave.The evocation of the period certainly seems painstakingly accurate - the houses, avenues, alleys, hotels, schools, clothes, cars, street stalls; the air of despondancy and lack of hope; the marbles and crackling radios; the kind of poverty that forced some people to dress in their underwear; the remnants of gangster/bootlegger culture; the American need for mythology.  This is compounded by the gorgeous sepia-tinged cinematography, evoking many of the familiar ways the America of this period is constructed in the collective memory.  The year 1933 is also the year Hitler became Chancellor in Germany, and although the fact isn't explicitely mentioned, there is a tacit critique of an American society of ominous paralells anti-Semitism; racist, fascist policemen; repellent WASPs, whose snobbery goes into collective, nightmarish action against the upstart outsider.  There are two very powerful images that evoke the camps that will feature in Germany over the next decade - the gaunt artist, Mr. Sandoz, forced out of his apartment into a makeshift settlement, dressed like an emaciated prisoner; the Jewish Lester being carted off by the police for bootlegging, saying goodbye to Aaron as if he'll never see him again.All of these elements seem to fix KING firmly in time, except for one thing - the style.  If you weren't told you were watching a film from early 1930s America, you wouldn't know it.  Whatever the horrors displayed on screen, the camera retains a dignified distance, with slowly elegant movements, opening and recording space like it's an Antonioni film.  The beauty of the photography, the perpetual sunlight, the charming music, the set design that makes a shabby armchair and a suburban mansion equally attractive are completely at odds with the story that is being told. Although the story is about a boy who is cut off from his family, partakes in risky adventures, undergoes demeaning social experiences and eventually begins to starve, the film doesn't vary its point of view or style to accomodate his mindset, always keeping the same steady distance.This might sound simply like bad filmmaking, but it's not.  Soderbergh's main interest is in how we represent history, how we construct our images of it.  This disparity between form and content forces us to question our responses to the latter.  How is it possible to make a pretty picture about the Depression?  Throughout the film signs are foregrounded and interrogated (eg billboards, the chessboard floor of the hotel, the discussion in the lift about different types of letters); the difference between how we experience reality and how society chooses to depict it.  This is brought most terrifyingly home when Aaron can't afford any food, has no-one to turn to, and is forced to cut out pictures from a magazine and arrange them on a plate.  This is also probably why the ending feels so ridiculous and forced - an impossible deus ex machina which weaves together a number of disparate crises into an ideal whole.  Only moments earlier, the film had finally begun to break its distance and show Aaron's mind in all its nightmarish terror.  How reliable is this ending?  Isn't it another example of the American inability to face genuine misery head-on without some kind of preposterous redemption?  Isn't American history simply a narrative of evasion? "}]
