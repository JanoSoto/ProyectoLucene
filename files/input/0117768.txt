Landis is having a go at everyone and everyTHING in this ode to cinematic oafishness.  He gets away with murder here, whereas Brian Levant who persists in trying to offer disastrously unfunny family comedy like THE FLINTSTONES simply falls over his own Director's chair.I just about wet myself the first time I heard Arnold break out into his musical monologue  I AM MY OWN GRANDPA That has to be one of the funniest things I have ever seen on the big screen.

If you rate this movie a 1, you either are trying to hate it or don't have a sense of humor.It's not high art, but the deadpan acting is spot on, and if you really look at it, the writing in this script is far more complex and well crafted than most gross out comedies people seem to applaud. While other comedies just string together some non-sequeters, this one has a tightly woven throughline, with one line of dialogue or action not only leading to the next, but so integral to the story that if you were to remove a gag or a character, the house of cards would collapse.It is theater of the absurd and farce at it a high level. And it is telling that some people who say this is the worst movie ever also say the Kentucky Fried Movie was a miss despite that film being the first of it's kind and leading to hundreds of films since that these same people probably loved.

This movie is so stupid that even veterans of the slapstick comedy genre will be cringing. Just look at the quotes and you'll have some nice examples of what I mean. MAN BUSH, you have no equal! The plot is interesting - Stanley Stupid wakes up one day to discover his garbage stolen again from right outside his own home. Determined to find those responsible, he sets off on a quest to find a man called Sender, who through... crazy and foolish logic, he believes is planning a worldwide conspiracy to steal the world's garbage.Along the way he uncovers a military weapons distributing operation, which forms most of the opposition in the plot, as they try to kill him repeatedly, and through sheer stupidity and luck, he evades them.You can't accuse the story of being clich√© or unoriginal - not many movies involve meeting God in a planetarium.The characters are all uniquely stupid, and while their clothes are as unpleasant as fashion can be, they're all very entertaining. Except the daughter, who may annoy more than entertain, but you get those in every movie.All in all, as long as you're looking for a film with humour so.. STUPID, you'll wet yourself, then you'll probably laugh yourself silly watching this. I first saw it back in 1997 or so, and only managed to find the video last year on ebay.

Should I apologize for that?  No, I don't believe I should.  I find Tom Arnold funny.  I like watching dumb people do stupid things; it makes me feel better about myself.  I actually burst out laughing during several parts of this movie.  The car-bomb was the best.However, I realize that not everyone will like this movie.  Most people, in fact, will hate it.  So let me sum up what is wrong with this movie.First off, there is the terrible acting.  God-awful.  Oh-the-pain, where-did-they-find-that-kid acting.  Tom Arnold is not a particularly good actor - he did well in True Lies because Cameron is a good director that understands timing - but Tom Arnold doesn't have much facial expression variety, and he spends most of the movie wearing that same stupid grin plastered on the cover of the video.  The kids weren't much better, but I fault the director for that one (I'll get to the direction in a minute).Secondly, the clever script.  Now, the first time I watched this, I thought it was clever, too.  But after re-watching, I realized that if your characters are incredibly stupid, you can throw motivation out the window.  I can imagine the writers - how can we justify them putting the garbage out every week even though it gets stolen Oh, that's easy, they're STUPID!  This movie is full of that.  Unbelievably bad choices only made because the characters have no integrity.  A movie like this writes itself, because you are freed from the bonds of actual cleverness; characters that do anything allow you to do whatever you want and not have to worry about whether it makes sense.  Trust me, if you watch this, you'll see what I mean.  The Stupids never do anything that makes sense, which is why it's funny.  But an intelligent script, it is not.Lastly, there is the slipshod direction.  This movie is very theatrical.  Deep theater roots.  Its comedy is awkward, obvious, and drawn out, just like theater comedy.  There is no subtlety whatsoever.  If you want the movie to be funny, it will be funny.  But if you are suspicious, it is certainly not going to win your heart.And that, in the end, is the problem with the movie; if you don't want to like it, you won't, because it is too easy to dislike.  Only see it if you are truly interested and believe that it can be good, because its charm and uniqueness are its good qualities.  This is not a movie that disappoints - it is a movie that sits right where you expect it to lie on the quality scale.  If you believe it can be good, it will reward you.  But if you see it and don't like it, it really is because you didn't want to enjoy it, for whatever reason.

The characters are lovable and unforgettable, innocent idiots who make you laugh whereas real-life idiots just make you angry. The plot is twisty-turny and ridiculous, with a happy, certain, positive message. There are two worlds, the imaginary world of the Stupids, and the real (though still stupidified) world inhabited by the other characters. The ingenuity of the writers, as in Cervantes and Shakespeare, involves the unifying of both worlds into one linear stream of events, each event having unforeseeable effects in the other world, and pushing the plot towards the glorious point at which the conflicts in both worlds are simultaneously resolved. In this respect, it could be compared to the best, most recent films of Roberto Benigni, films like The Monster and Life is Beautiful in which the clear, warm glow of the imaginary world outshines the dark, mean-spirited murk of the real one. The Stupids gave me, more than once, that Yeah, THIS is what life is all about! feeling, something I never expected to find when my little cousins insisted we rent it. Even discounting all that sugary garbage, it's fun to watch, the pieces of the plot fall cleverly into place with beautifully-timed coolness, and they even throw in a great song, JUST BECAUSE IT'S GREAT!Much as I love it, and always will, The Stupids is not perfect. Despite its general goodness and high quotabilty, some of the dialogue could've been tweaked, although 90% of the lines are exactly as they should be, advancing the plot, developing the characters (adding subtle layers of stupidity to their psychotic personalities), and being funny. Certain characters, like the pets (well, only the pets), I found to be superfluous and tedious, seemingly added on the whim of some evil, Senderesque movie-tyrant who thought it could use just a bit more cuteness to appeal to the something-or-other age bracket. The sight gags are all well conceived, but often poorly executed. I can't help the feeling that maybe some in-charge people didn't have enough faith in the film (or, anyway, in its financial success) to justify spending a leetle bit more time and effort (and $) on making it perfect.Faults notwithstanding, it remains a happy escape and a surprising hidden treasure for those who take the time to watch it and to savor it, and to laugh at how stupid it isn't.

The Stupids is an atrocious, dim-witted film with absolutely no artistic merit whatsoever, and is a denigration to a director like John Landis. And that's what makes it great.In order to appreciate The Stupids, you have to keep in mind a little-known, but very true maxim spoken by director Abo Kyrou I urge you to learn to look at bad films, they are so often sublime. In order for any film to work, the film must establish and follow it's own logic, and if it does so convincingly and sincerely, then it's actually possible for the film to work. For example, when you watch Freddy Got Fingered as a traditional gross-out comedy, it's complete and utter garbage; when you watch it with the understanding that it's actually a neo-surrealist comedy, it's brilliant.It works with good movies too. If Jaws hadn't accepted the reality it created, the air-tank explosion ending wouldn't have worked. But, a lot of people think Jaws is vastly overrated for this type of reason, and they aren't wrong. But it has it's strengths, doesn't it? The point being that a movie like this makes sense if you look at it with the right perspective. Some people, like me, get it right away, while others never will no matter how often it's explained. Jim Jarmusch made a compelling defense of Showgirls once, and even afterwards I still can't see it from his P.O.V. Doesn't mean he's wrong though. If you have the right frame of mind when you watch this movie (and NO I DO NOT MEAN STONED, I'm gonna put that to bed right now), you can actually enjoy the movie for the dumb, cheap, pointless slapstick late-80s/early-90s-style farce that it is.The defenders and haters of this film are right It's STUPID, and that's the point. The movie accepts the stupidity of the characters much in the same way The Jerk accepted Navin Johnson's idiocy. And because it takes that and runs with it, the movie focuses exclusively on using that to forward the plot and to define the characters. A bad movie would actually do this and fail to use that logic properly; bad movie are bad because they make it up as they go along, whereas movies like The Stupids knows where it's going, what it's doing and why from the beginning.I can't defend the film from an artistic standpoint, which is why I give it such a low rating. The acting is mostly bad, the jokes very superficial, and the live-action quality probably ruins what would have worked as a cartoon. But I can't deny that it IS entertaining in its own way, and that's why I defend it. I got it right away, and I pity those who don't.I'll admit I was drawn to this movie because of Christopher Lee's delicious cameo appearance (hearing him say Release the drive bee! would have been worth the rental price even if I hated this film), but was amazed to find that, aside from the TV Studio Applause Sign segment with Jenny McCarthy, I was never bored, and never disappointed. In fact, many of the jokes, because of their cartoonish context, were hilarious (in particular the airbag-cigarette explosion). They were dumb, but they were funny. And the movie doesn't pretend to be anything else a STUPID comedy about STUPID characters and instead of apologizing for it, it enjoys itself.And that's exactly why it works.

The acting and the supposed funny moments are clearly fake, predictable, overacted, clich√©d and not funny. Dumb & Dumber for instance was also about two abnormally stupid guys but there was a sense that the movie allowed for you to pick up the stupid moments-and yes, while they weren't hard to pick up at least it wasn't in-your-face-turn-at-the-camera-and-over-emphasize-the words type of moments.Furthermore, in Dumb & Dumber while the two main characters were stupid, nobody else in the movie was. Here, EVERYBODY in the movie is as stupid, dim and dense as the main 'characters'. And at least D&D had a degree of realism in that as stupid as the main characters were, their low-life lifestyle matched them. Here, the Stupids are a well-off family yet utterly useless! I realize I may be babbling but movies like this irritate because I fail to see why people bother making them and in so doing insult moviegoers to such a degree. There's no no pint in taking intelligence out of the equation as one reviewer noted because if a movie can be funny and entertaining with a degree of intelligence in it, why should you take intelligence out of this movie? Is it because the makers had none themselves and were too lazy to put in an effort with this movie? It's a crime to call this a comedy or a movie. The animated pets and aliens at the end utterly made me lose the plot! I only watched about 20min and I was left irritated for days.

Today I am the only one of the family who remembers it ever existed. I can recall all the best gags and to this day cannot think of some if them without laughing out loud.It's time to face facts this is a FUNNY movie!For those of you not familiar with the Stupid books (a favorite of mine in childhood), they follow a lovable, but naive and essentially retarded, family, somewhere along the lines of The Addams Family and the Simpsons. Notable gags include like a flower labeled Mount Stupid or a man arrives at a costume party dressed as the Easter Bunny, who comes down the chimney saying Ho ho ho!,; later it is revealed he was, in fact, merely wearing his Sunday best. Not the most intelligent or witty humor, but hilarious in its own right.The movie very much follows in this vein. The humor is, albeit, a little childish, but it can also be droll, absurd, ridiculous and clever, in a way similar to Looney Tunes, or the more slapstick comedies of Mel Brooks. The Stupid Family continues their idiotic antics, while at the same time coming across a very serious enemy--some sort of evil military killing squad whose purpose I can only vaguely remember. The serious people aren't important, really-- it's how the Stupids react to them that is the spirit of the film. Tom Arnold plays Stanley Stupid, ineffectual patriarch of the Stupid clan, fittingly with cheerfulness, energy and sheer, utter obliviousness. Yes, he did win the Award for Worst Actor this year, but it was for two other films as well as this one. People should keep that in mind before judging the movie and Tom.Granted, I saw this film many, many, years ago, when I was a young child, and since then have relied solely on memory of it. If I were to see it again today, or even if I saw it today for the first time, I might not think so fondly of it. But the world has seen many, more famous comedic films that are not nearly as funny. Does it deserve its condemnation and obscurity? That is something I'll leave you to decide for yourselves. But in order to do that, you have to WATCH IT!! "},{"Title":"Tom Arnold is Stupid.

It opens with Stanley Stupid (Tom Arnold) discovering that somebody stole their garbage when wife Joan (Jessica Lundy) left it out overnight. Stanley was determined to get to the bottom of this so he stayed out late that night and watched the garbage men collect the trash, then he chased them on rollerblades.        Children Buster (Big Hall) and Petunia (Alex McKenna) awaken to find Stanley gone. They go to the police, leaving a note that suggested the police kidnapped them. Joan read the note and was terrified. Stanley arrives at the dump and witnesses a weapons deal made with people from around the world. The operation was headed by The Colonel (Mark Metcalf) and Lieutenant (Matt Keeslar).Stanley didn't know about the weapons, he was just astounded by all the garbage in the dump.        Joan, Buster and Petunia meet at the Times office. They end up printing an article entitled Two Alien Pilots Pick Nose. I won't explain why. Watch the movie. That irks off two alien pilots who vow revenge on Stanley Stupid for writing it. The Stupids needed help, so they called 75,496-11 and ended up ordering cole slaw.        When Stanley returns home, he proposes they go after a man named Sender. (He used to work in the post office and was confused when he got mail saying Return to Sender). They track Charles Sender to the museum where Stanley and Petunia enter the planitarium and think it's Heaven. Literally. Joan and Buster supposidly travel back in time to the age of dinosaurs.          No luck there so they head to the TV studio and cause quite a hilarious string of mischief. But in the end of our story, The Colonel goes to jail and The Stupids are finally at peace, knowing the police are once again on their side. Stanley even get's rid of the two alien pilots without knowing it.        A very funny movie. A good idea. Tom Arnold made two other interesting films that year, Carpool and Big Bully.

I know some people have been badmouthing Tom Arnold and saying that he is unfunny and can't act. But that simply isn't true. His talent and versatility has been proven many times in films such as True Lies, Carpool, Big Bully, Austin Powers - International Man Of Mystery, and of course The Stupids. Furthermore I was delighted to see Christopher Lee making a cameo appearance as The evil archvillain Sender. He is brilliant. This movie was virtually a smorgasbord of jokes. All well thought out and carried out. But I must say that my favorite moment is when Stanley Stupid accidently stumbles upon a talk show where the subject is weird family relations. He meets some very disturbed people with some very peculiar family relations, but he still manages to outdo them all by proving that he's his own grandpa. It's hilarious. Catch it, if you can!

If you're going to enjoy this movie, you have to be a willing co-conspirator, able to reserve judgement. You have to meet this movie on it's own level, not expect it to come to you. Like a play instead of a modern, 'ran through tons of focus groups', Hollywood flick. If you go in feeling lots of skepticism or feel like your 'inner film-critic' wants to watch the movie with you for live analysis, then go see The Piano. If you want to see an absurd spectacle made of the modern nuclear family, with a subversive glint, and a Hollywood (low)budget, perhaps to almost suffocate from laughter, then watch 'The Stupids'. Stanley was a role Tom Arnold was born to play.OK, first understand that this movie isn't played like your average American 'popular comedy' movie.(As evidenced by it's poor box office showing.) The characters come from a series of children's books that gained a global underground following after a number of Family Values Groups tried to get it banned in the US. So that sets the stage for me for what they were actually trying to do with this movie, and I love the hell of out it.The director and the writers and heck, even the underwriters really had some balls to put this movie out like they did. A real gamble to make a bad movie, well done, totally on purpose. None of the characters are social archetypes that are 'too cool for school', they're not going to bank on pop culture references or nostalgia, they don't expect you to relate to what you're seeing or sympathize with the characters. I don't want to say Brechtian, but it's definitely old-school theatre style. Everything is done for the pure purpose of hilarious spectacle, to make the viewer question both what they're seeing, and their sanity. When Mrs. Stupid comes out wearing that camouflage dress she made out of wigs, I knew I had lost it. You won't see that anywhere else, played straight like it was, like, there's mom, in a ghillie suit made of wigs., in perfect context, and almost making sense? You either take this movie at face value, and run the risk of some of the best parts flying over your head, or you can understand that this movie plays on a totally different level. It's very aggressive with it's delivery of gags, then ignores the gag part totally, and then to see how everything nests into everything else so subtly, you almost wonder if the Stupid family are actually of some kind of mad genius savants. They definitely live in a different reality than we do, and the joke of the film is that it actually all works, in a way that isn't forced.See it. Get it from the DVD bargain bin. This film deserves a shot to make you laugh.

(spoilers)","Date":"11 August 2004","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Adventure","Review":"  John Landis's The Stupids isn't your average family film because it operates entirely on stupid comedy. Kids are sure to enjoy the zany adventures of the Stupid family, and even adults can enjoy a good laugh as well.The Stupids aren't your average family. The name says it all. They're a pleasant, peaceful, but dimwitted bunch (no...not really stupid, just out of place like the Brady's in the Brady Bunch Movie spoof). Heading up the cast is Tom Arnold in an atypical role for him because he's not some crude, obnoxious guy in this one. Nope, he's Stanley Stupid. And he's out to save the world.Stanley's noticed that someone has been stealing the trash during the night, and suspects foul play. However, his impulsive assumptions lead him to believe that the stolen trash is evidence that the world is in danger, all thanks to a man known as Sender (having remembered that, as an employee in the post office, all the mail was going to Sender--being marked Return to Sender (Christopher Lee)--who would hold people's mail hostage rather than sending it to the marked addresses). Stanley, his wife (Jessica Lundy as Joan Stupid) and two kids, (Alex MacKenna as Petunia Stupid and Bug Hall as Buster Stupid), are going to track down Mr. Sender and stop garbage theft once and for all! But while the Stupids are running around town investigating this conspiracy, their misadventures do interrupt a real source of corruption involving the military and a weapons smuggling operation (with an ending similar to True Lies). The Stupids suffer from Mr. Magoo syndrome because they're actually saving the day completely by accident, and completely unbeknownst to them. That's why it is so funny.The family even looks completely bizarre, what with Stanley's barbershop quartet type suit and styrofoam ragtime hat. And Petunia Stupid's B52s-esque junior beehive hairdo, for example. There are a lot of great moments in this movie that make it a fun family production (though sometimes the idiocy is just too much). I particularly like the scene where Tom Arnold tries to start the car without the key and makes the motion of turning the key without actually having it. Uh oh! The car won't start! (It's like something Homer Simpson would do). And then out comes The Stupid's cute CG animated cat to give old Stanley the keys. Or when they get in the elevator thinking it is a time machine (because they're at the science museum). Buster get's hungry with power and decides to carve his name on the wall. Everything in life will be a footnote to Buster! Great stuff. But, geez, this movie sure gets a lot of flack from viewers. It's a kids movie. Light-hearted family entertainment with jokes galore meant to entertain young audiences (and do it well). Even slightly older than your six to ten year old range, since there is that weapons smuggling subplot. And the characters (both in appearance and the individual nature of the characters), the dialogue, and the completely silly situations that the Stupids get themselves into are really funny. For you older viewers (past your pre-teens), it's not supposed to be a movie that requires critical thought. The Stupids are very cartoon-esque.

But there are a few decent jokes, and it's harmless fare for the kids.There aren't that many movies around these days that aren't full of cuss words and innuendo, where parents can just stick the film in the VCR and feel like their kids aren't being bombarded by the seamy side of life. With only one or two Oh, my God!s and one What the hell? (uttered by a policeman), this is one of those films. Some might feel the references to God are a bit irreverent, but personally, I don't think so. It's just that the Stupids are, well, stupid.The Stupids is a silly slapstick farce in which Stanley, the husband, decides to investigate who keeps stealing the family garbage. From this small beginning, he uncovers an apparent worldwide conspiracy to take over the entire world led by the evil Mr. Sender (played, variously, by Christopher Lee and Bob Keeshan -- better known to the world as Captain Kangaroo...)Not a great award winner... and after the first time I saw it I thought once was surely enough... but after a day or two, I find myself saying, I might be willing to watch that stupid movie with the kids again sometime.

Before this year people only looked at Mr. Arnold as a sidekick. But after Big Bully, Carpool, and The Stupids (all released in 1996), Tom Arnold skyrocketed to international superstardom. This is one of the great comedic gems of the past decade. Tom Arnold proves that it pays to be stupid with this movie. The laugh scale on this movie is through the roof. New movies that rely on sick and perveted humor (e.g. Scary Movie 1 & 2, Not Another Teen Movie) cannot even contend with the laughs you'll get from this movie. Even classic comedies like Dr. Strangelove or even Montey Python and the Holy Grail cant contend with this powerhouse!! Peter Sellers and John Cleese have been shown up by the up and coming superstar Tom Arnold. But lets not forget the supporting cast. Bug Hall is simply amazing as Buster Stupid. Brent Forrester knows how to write a comedic movie script and the dialogue between Buster and his younger sister Petunia is absolutely hilarious. Director John Landis gives us his best comedic direction since Animal House. Comedic movie and movie fans alike...this is a must have for the collection. Too bad this movie is not available on DVD.

Arnold is actually quite nice as Mr. Stupid and the other cast members try very, very hard to make the film work.
