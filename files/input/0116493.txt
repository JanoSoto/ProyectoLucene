I liked it for that time. I in fact tried to emulate Harriet and her friends. But those days are over now. What I am trying to say is don't say this is an awful movie because you found it dumb. Yes, some of it may be a little...juvenile. But remember, it WAS MADE for juveniles, not adults or anyone else but the age range of 8-12. If you are between the ages of eight and twelve, and you still hated it, then yes, it is understandable. But it is ridiculous for an adult to say that they hated this movie because it is 'too juvenile'. I think this movie has a great plot and a great message to young children. Be truthful to your friends, and you will succeed beyond your dreams. I also read the book, and this movie is quite close to the book, which is a good thing for a movie to be. In totality, this is a cute movie with a good message, and if you liked the movie, read the book too.

I had read the book back in the early eighties in the fifth grade and had never forgotten it. I always thought that it would make a good film (along with the Narnia tales and A Wrinkle in Time). The book was very engrossing and seemed a lot smarter and less condescending than some of the other books that wound up on school library 'recommended' lists. The movie contains the same wit and utter lack of condescension, making it a rarity in the world of tweenage cinema. Michelle Trachtenberg is very good. Her innate charisma and complete chemistry with Rosie o'Donnell make for perfect casting. Ms. O'Donnell herself shows once again how well she can carry off playing these quiet nurturing roles. (for another good performance by Rosie, see also Wide Awake)Harriet seems like a typical albeit intelligent kid. Her friends are like real friends they can be there for you and they can turn on you if they themselves feel under attack. This defense/offense posture is typical in a child's world. and that's what's great about Harriet the Spy. You never feel that the film is talking down to its audience or trying to present the child world in such a sweetened watered-down way so as to placate adults. Harriet and her friends have their little quirks. there's also the other kids who have wierdnesses about them that if we try hard we can all relate to. For instance, there exists in every classroom a perfect Teacher's Pet like Marion Hawthorne. There is also a Pinky Whitehead and a boy with purple socks. (probably me back then haha) the important thing is that the movie accepts their world without whitewashing or judging them for it. Those posters who felt that the movie was juvenile must understand that it WAS written for children. That doesn't however mean that adults should avoid it. It contains several themes that can be discussed and understood by anyone Coping with school, Coping with Growing Up, Trouble with peers and miscommunication and isolation with parents and peers alike. As i said earlier, The character of Harriet was well thought-out. They could've done a little better fleshing out the character of Janie. If i remember correctly, she had a somewhat larger role in the book. But they actually improved on Sport's role.Some people have complained that the movie is disjointed and at times unrealistic. Well, try and think back to when you were eleven. wasn't the world somewhat surreal and disjointed? The movie is from The subjective lens of Harriet's minds-eye, an eye that see things with more than a little wit and imagination. Think back...then you'll get it.

Harriet wants to learn about people and she wants to learn how to express  her thought about them.  So, she decides to becomes a spy and thus eavesdrops on the  nuances of the world around her.  Of course, her schoolmates find her all too different,  and when they learn what she has been writing about, they decide to castigate her and  that is where things come to a head.  Children can be cruel.  Even Harriet.  But they can  also be hurt more profoundly.  Here is a story about growing up.  Like Stand By Me, it  enjoys humor, but balances itself carefully between the light and dark sides of  growing up.  Michelle Tractenberg is nothing short of superb in her role as Harriet M.  Welsch.  Rediscovered as Dawn Summers in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, here is a girl who  by rights should have been placed on equal terms with Anna Paquin in Fly Away Home  or Anna Chlumsky in My Girl.

Well, it _is_ disjointed part of it is surreal allegory, part realistic morality play. Part of it moves with a natural rhythm while other parts seem to have been transplanted from afternoon TeeVee. Some is done with a cartoon cosmology, and the rest is straight from Marlo Thomas' heart. Distributed throughout are mottles of bad acting and unconsidered dialog.And I loved it all. Why?Because this is in the tradition of movies and books that generate themselves. Rather, the characters in the stories play double duty as the authors of the story and the creators of the world that surrounds it. So it makes sense as precisely what a preteen would imagine her older self writing about her. Indeed, the whole thing is a meditation on how someone might abstract the world (for writing) without a mature faculty for abstraction &#151; which is to say how a kid would imagine an adult's mind imagining a kid's mind.Its all about the deep problems of writing. I imagine the author of the original book sitting down and having trouble writing, them ruminating about why on the page.Therefore, we have a youthful experimenter, a blocked writer, a gardener who makes environments from trash, another maker of environments (cages) who craves companionship, a woman who lives in a cage (Kitt), the Dad who is a movie comedian, together with lesser characters.And the spy who spies so she can write what we see. It is all about sight and callow abstraction, just what movies were made for. Sure, it differs from the book because film can amplify what the book cannot. The adapter (the guy that did the game as life as game Jumanji project) understood this.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3 Worth watching.

The direction is good, the tone of the film is quirky and the performances are great. Michelle Trachtenberg is perfectly cast as Harriet, Trachtenberg was a very promising child actress and this is proof of that. Eartha Kitt is great as Agatha, and Gregory Smith and Vanessa Lee Chester both give spirited turns as Sport and Janie. As Harriet's nanny, Rosie O'Donnell is a really pleasant surprise.

At first, I thought it was going to be one of those disappointing, modernized versions, mostly because of the distracting musical score, but despite the truly annoying score, the movie remained true to the book except for a few minor details. Even the toys depicted were from the era that the book was written in. I think that's so important when making a movie out of a children's book. The story is brilliant, about a little girl who wants to be a writer, so she gets her practice by keeping a notebook in which she writes down all her thoughts and observations about the people in her world, and even goes to the extreme of spying on people to get her material. When the notebook falls into the wrong hands, her world is turned upside down. I think the film does a very good job of portraying the children in a realistic light, and I could identify with Harriet's feelings as well as those of her friends and classmates. The adults in the movie, as well as Harriet's nemesis, seemed a bit like caricatures, but Harriet's character and those of her best friends were quite well developed. Definitely worth seeing if you are a fan of this book.

Nothing is more adequate than such quote when the analyzed person is the great Le Carré, author of treasures like Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Smiley's People among many other espionage novels. The same can't be said to the main character of Harriet the Spy neither about the story, that almost reached such description (and it could have been way better).So, little Harriet (Michelle Trachtenberg) wants to be a writer and for such she pretends to be like a spy who sees everything, writing down all the things she sees, from random and somewhat pointless happenings to making truthful remarks about her friends and school mates. But when her diary is stolen by her most ferocious enemy things can turn out to be real bad for her if such descriptions be known to everyone she knows.A cute movie, nice to watch but that doesn't help us much. Fine, this a movie for kids and for them is prefect, very enjoyable, but those kind of flicks work better if they attract mature audiences as well, even if using two or three jokes for them. The cast assembled here with names like Trachtenberg, Rosie O'Donnell, Robert Joy and Gregory Smith makes of Harriet the Spy quite a good film, and we can excuse some of its problems.The main focus that a good writer is made with observations and notes only isn't much handy (as Harriet discovers). Above all, and I can't believe this was left out of the movie, a good writer must be a great reader of all sources and different types of readings, must have a background of readings. And if I'm making too much fuzz over a kid's movie, too much complications, is because is that I wanted to see an intelligent work, with this kind of plot but in a dramatic way, with lots of suspense, a teenager who wants to be a writer but gets involved with more and more trouble while covering a story.

Yes, adults need to stop thinking childhood is all about happiness. Personally, it got me to write. At the time I saw this film I had gotten into writing fiction at about age 6. This actually gave me the idea to start journal writing and I have yet to stop at age 22. The way Harriet resolves things with her friends is a bit quick, but I think it's because the other kids become hypocrites. During my college Children's Lit class, we discussed this book and how Harriet is attacked because her thoughts become public. Everyone thinks negative thoughts about everyone else -- It shouldn't make her the target. Self expression is very important to everyone, I think that is a big part of what the story and film are about. Her writing and exploration of the society around her is just like any other child's.

Harriet spies a lot, writes down what she learns and observe, and wants to be something in life. Too bad her friends snooped in her notebook and she got exposed. I felt bad for her after everybody found out her private thoughts and hated her for it. Sometimes kids can be relentless. I felt worse when the kids became spy catchers and interfered with her spying, including her own friends Sport and Janie. I also cannot believe they went and got blue paint all over her. I knew after that bitch Marion poured paint in her hair and got slapped in the face for it, that was going to be it. Harriet wasn't lying when she told them she was going to get them real bad, and she did. As I watched her get back at the kids that did cruel things to her, I was cracking up, especially when Laura got nailed by an unexpected haircut. Too bad for Beth's pictures she posted. Harriet vandalized them. Time to throw them away. When Carrie was looking for her bra, it wasn't pretty when she realized that bra Harriet put on a pole was hers. And look how bad Pinky and Janie's projects turned out after Harriet tampered with them. Mostly, I felt worse for Marion and Sport when Harriet said something false about her father to Marion to make her cry like crazy and when Harriet humiliated Sport in front of the whole school by posting an embarrassing picture of him. He was so broken hearted. that was going way too far and was really low even for her. Not just her, all of them. Well, I am glad Harriet's nanny, Golly, gave her advice on what to do. I am even more glad everybody forgave her and left that club Marion and Rachel invented. Besides, even though Marion may have edited the newspaper for 3 years, her writing wasn't as good. She just threw in something and got credit for it. But Harriet knows what she is talking about as the editor of the newspaper now. People are interested and they aren't laughing. You know why? Because it all makes sense. The kids get the point. Harriet had details that made sense. Marion just threw in anything, just so she could get what she wanted. That girl acted like a brat when Harriet suggested it was time to change the person who's editor. She learned that it always doesn't have to be about her, especially at the pageant. Her dancing was all right, but boring. Harriet and her friends fast and active dancing was awesome. Plus, kids really got their groove on when they were limboing on stage, especially Marion, Harriet and her friends. Also, I am relieved that Harriet got back to her spy route after she was forgiven.

She simply could've been the bigger person to actually realize that her nosey habits and attitude were the problem, not just other people.

It's simple look at the author's illustrations in the book, and find actors who look like that. Eartha Kitt can be wonderful, but she's no Agatha Plummer&#x85; what about Angela Lansbury? Or Rue McClanahan? The worst choice of all was Rosie O'Donnell as Ole Golly.

I must be one of the few people in the country to have watched this, but I'm glad that I did.I've always been a Michelle Trachtenberg fan, right since I watched 17 Again and Eurotrip. That's not just because of her adorably cute face, but also because she is a very fun and light-hearted person. When I first heard that she got her very own movie in which she starred as the main character at the age of 12 (6 years before I was born), no questions asked I went and watched that film straight away.To begin with, I was never familiar with the story of Harriet the Spy, since it's such an old series I couldn't even read by the time it was already several years old. At first, I thought it was about an actual 'child-spy' who uncovered some kind of secret plot, and I thought it was just going to be another one of those Home Alone-type movies. But when it came to watching it, I found something much, much better.Michelle's acting was amazing for a 12-year-old girl, and when she wanted to look intimidating, she looked intimidating as hell. As the story began to unravel, revealing the typical problems with friendships (just in a more exaggerated and horribly cruel way (I mean, paint buckets? That's traumatizing.)), I found myself either making an awfully loud Aww sound every few seconds or quietly sobbing as I felt sorry for Harriet.To sum the whole thing up, Harriet the Spy is a heartfelt and truly touching film with guffawing comedy, bawling drama and everything in between. For me, it wasn't just a family movie (I also watched it on my own, so that's another weird thing to add on to how I am 14 years old, at an age where no-one watches such emotional tales) it was a life lesson to helping your friends and never leaving them no matter what.

Welsch, the little kid detective. Watch this with your kids, parents. It is so funny! I highly recommend this movie to everybody. Everyone will love it. Especially the kids. It teaches them a good lesson. It taught me one when I was little.The plot is so silly but so fun that it makes the movie so fun. I loved watching it when I was little. Me being older now, 15, makes me a little less into it but I still adore this and I watch it with my little cousin Lydia every Thanksgiving. She loves it as much as I do. Watch this movie. It's so awesome!

This movie is so inspiring, one that you just have to see. If you're a young child, it's great and if you get a lil older, it's still the greatest and you could be caught crying. All I can say is that it's just beautiful and it's just so detailed and you can understand it more. Harriet The Spy has so much drama and it just has so much meaning to it. You see how important certain people are and the inspiration Harriet has towards becoming a writer. It's beautiful...and if you ever see any movie, it had better be this one. This movie is still my favorite today just because of how much it impacted me. I love to write and this shows how writing can make the world a better place...what you write can make a difference...because you'll know more and be able to help others...

When it came out i was a kid and i loved it! As did my girlfriend and we still do. There are some really funny bits and touching bits. For instance when gully leaves and when Harriet gets her notebook taken away. Also when gully returns. I enjoy watching this movie, in fact i watched it yesterday. i think that all kids should be supported in their ventures such as writing in a notebook. Notebooks are such a great thing to spurn creativity. Some people just love the smell, and the look of a blank white page. They like it even better when it's filled with pretty things and words.fabulous movie.

I remember seeing it for the first time as a kid. It was one of my favorites. It was back when Michelle Trachtenberg wasn't on my s**t list. Excuse the vulgarity, but there was no other way to say it. I haven't liked anything she's done since and I miss the days of Harriet the Spy. This movie reminds me of what it was like to be a kid always fun and carefree. Everything was an adventure and you knew that you and your buddies would be friends forever.It's a great movie for kids, full of laughter, suspense, and adventure. I also thought Rosie O'Donnell was amazing as well. The role was perfect for her because I'd always seen her as that kind of nurturing mother-figure. And Eartha Kitt???! What a riot! She was amazing, over-the-top, as usual. My favorite scene would have to be the one where she sneaks into Eartha Kitt's house. It's amazingly funny and gives you a good idea of what the rest of the movie will be like. This one is a must see for families with children. Actually, it's a must see for everyone, because we all need a movie that makes us feel young again and Harriet the Spy definitely does that. I give it a 9 out of 10.

It was very real about how your friends can turn against you by things that you write. Michelle Trachtenberg deserved an award for this movie. It does take a while to move, but, at the end, it was exceptionally great. It's more of a movie for the family than just for the kids. I love it. If you have to pick a movie for everyone, rush to get this and don't think twice. You won't regret it. After the movie, you'll probably want to get a nice composition notebook and write down everything, pun intended.

I really enjoyed it; I was happy to find a kid's film that wasn't some Disney crud and wasn't overly strange. Based on a popular novel, Harriet is a misfit preteen aspiring author, bullied by a snobby girl in her class. She has two friends, a boy living on welfare (Sport) and a girl who wants to be a mad scientist (Jamie). She spends most of her time with her beloved nanny Golly (Rosie O'Donnell). When Golly takes Harriett and a boyfriend to the cinema without parental permission, she is fired, leaving Harriett to grow up on her own. When her private notebook (with some very revealing things about her peers written inside) is discovered, her entire class becomes increasingly cruel towards her, leaving her to seek revenge on each one... but she really just wants her friends back.While Harriet the Spy is a lovable film no matter what your age, there was use of crude humor and mild swearing, fart jokes, etc. that got rather annoying after a while. As a kid I had very few friends, knew very little about society and didn't understand some of the things mentioned like the Nobel Peace Prize, Hitler and why Harriet was sent to a therapist, until a year or so later in my life. Still, the scene where Jamie's mother discovers her favorite Victoria's Secret leopard-print bra has been stolen by Jamie for a mold rowing experiment, I've always loved that scene. Harriet the Spy is also a movie that explains that two wrongs don't make a right, and that bullying somebody is wrong no matter what they've done, it just puts you down to their level of rationality. I honestly wish there were more movies for kids like this out there, because that god-awful My Little Pony crud TV show and the Hunger Games certainly aren't worth a dime compared to this memorable movie. The acting was great, the urban scenery dazzling and interesting and it closely follows the book. It's certainly worth watching, if you are sick of the garbage that's out today and want something different.

It really made me feel good and smile. I thought that Harriet (Michelle Trachtenberg) was a really good spy until Marion (Charlotte Sullivan) got ahold of her journal. My absolute favorite parts are when Harriet slaps Marion in the face after having paint dumped on her and when she tells Marion that her father doesn't care about her because he lives in Holland. If you ask me, she really deserved that slap in the face. I would have done the same thing if I were Harriet. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that the moral of this movie is that you should never write negative things about people and leave them where they can be read by others. In conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent spy flick to all you fans who have not seen it.

I don't know, but I just didn't seem to click with this movie. It's not very bad, but then again, it's not very good either. The overall plot seems to be poorly thought out and dull. There are also some obvious goofs regarding continuity and such. Another problem is this movie can get really ridiculous, even for a kid film. This isn't a bad movie, but it isn't good. It's average. "},{"Title":"a very overrated book, and movie.","Date":"10 October 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Family, Comedy, Drama","Review":"  The book, in my opinion, is perhaps one of the most overrated of all time. The old saying that a book is better than a movie, in this case, is true ( which is worse news for the film). This totally misrepresents kids. Firstly, there is no child out there willing to go through such great lengths to SPY on people even if it were the nazi's during world war 2. The only child sick enough to do these things should be committed to a mental institution. Secondly, no kid would have such trouble realising why it is that everyone is angry at her for spying on them. She invades their privacy and plans to reveal them to the world. What, did she think they'd never read it after it was published? I don't know about you, but I think I'd be interested in reading a book of a close friend, or even a nemesis who I grew up with.The acting in this film is subpar, even for a kids movie. It doesn't go into as much detail as the books did. And some of the most important scenes from the book are not in the film. This was a poor adaptation, from a well written ( however degrading to kids) novel. The first time I read the book, I hated it, and I hate it now. And for all fans of the book, you will be greatly disappointed in this film. Ridiculous, Nickleodeon, I want my money back.  "}{"Title":"Have I Missed Something?","Date":"14 March 2001","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Family, Comedy, Drama","Review":" Writing in a journal or diary as one grows up isn't such a bad thing. In fact, it allows children to get down their thoughts and feelings. It lets them get rid of heavy baggage, frustrations and remember the good things in life. Helps them find their voice and improving upon your writing skills is never a bad thing. Naturally you have the freedom to write whatever you want, but if you want to write about people, good and bad, and there's even an inkling of it coming out, you keep it private. That there is Harriet's problem and that there is the movie's plot. She carries her diary around with her everywhere and yup you guessed it eventually someone comes to find out what she's been writing and they don't like it. Look, I don't want to harp on this movie. It's obviously written for kids, but as an adult, I found it hard to sit through. That's the nicest way I can put it. I had a hard time really feeling bad for her as she reaped the consequences of her written words. It's not a bad film per se, but if you're not part of the age demographic its aimed at, I strongly suggest you stay away. The hindsight is such that my younger sisters liked it and that probably says it all. "}]
