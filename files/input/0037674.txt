[{"Title":"The Paramount Best Movie Ever Produced as a 'Gesamtkunstwerk'","Date":"19 February 2004","Score":"91 out of 96 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" 1995 was the centennial of the invention of movies. In Stockholm the event was celebrated, inter alia, by showing 'Les enfants du paradis' free of charge on the French National Day. It was presented as the best French movie ever made. Perhaps it was felt not to be polite toward other countries to talk of the best movie made in any countries. But many (not all) experts agree that it is indeed so. And so do I. I saw the film for the first time in 1954, and have never changed my mind about its paramount position. But whatever you may think in this respect, one of the most prominent features is that the movie is a 'GESAMTKUNSTWERK'. This word was invented by Richard Wagner to indicate a work in which music, text, and visual arts fuse or amalgamate into a unity. Concerning the movie at hand, the word is of course taken in a different sense. The movie contains all kinds of cinematic categories mass scenes perhaps with 10'000 extras, chamber play with close-up photos of emotional faces, deep and genuine love, superficial sex, friendship, comic pantomime, tragic pantomime, comic theatre (that is, both the theatre scene and the public on the screen), tragic theatre, murder, hand-to-hand-fighting, pocket-picking, etc. And everything put together into one single film. Even more, whenever a section is comic, it rests so completely in the comic mood that the spectator cannot imagine that the entire movie was not comic from the first beginning, and will not remain so to the last end. Whenever it is tragic, it rests equally completely in the tragic mood, as if it had never been anything else than tragic and would never leave the tragic mood. Despite this heterogeneity, the movie does not split up in disparate fragments, but forms a genuine whole. The writer was the really great poet Jacques Prévert, and it tells much about his unusual competence that, on the one hand, each scene is superb when seen in isolation and, on the other hand, each scene does not therefore fit less perfectly in the film as a whole. - - - To some people it may be interesting to know that four of the roles are real historical persons the actor Frederick Lemaître, the pantomimic performer Baptiste Debureau, the mediocre gangster Jean-François Lacenaire, and the latter's assistant Avril. Lacenaire was executed in 1836. His memoirs, which were written while he awaited execution, are published in English translation.

The Village was where I went when I had no where else to go, when I belonged no where, where I thought I could discover myself. It didn't hurt that there were people to stare at, without being too obvious about it.It was a gray day and it started to rain. I stopped under the first protection I found, a movie marque - neither handsome nor attractive.The photos promoting the film were behind glass at odd angles, held by tacks. I just wasn't in the mood. It wasn't what I was looking for. But the rain got worse, and I needed warmth. So I bought my ticket to join the twenty or so people who comprised the full audience.From its first moment, the film pulled me in. After a frenetic start, it quieted to Jean-Louis Barrault sitting alone on a barrel. I'd seen Marceau before, but not until now had I seen the quiet poetry of true mime.Barrault's character, Baptiste, had silently observed the theft of a watch. Baptiste pantomimed the theft but staged his pantomime as if people's perceptions were a mistake, as if the theft never took place. In the doing, he made everyone laugh. He did this for the love of Garance, played by Arletty, whom he had seen for the first time.There follows in the film first love - unrequited, poetic, soulful. We see villainy, melodrama, danger, heroism, satire, plays within plays - a host of stories all integral to the whole of the play. And we believe completely.It is the most complete film ever made. It changed my life.

Production was just beginning when Paris fell to the Nazis; the work was subsequently filmed piecemeal over a period of several years, much of it during the height of World War II. And yet astonishingly, this elaborate portrait of 19th Century French theatre and the people who swirl through it shows little evidence of the obvious challenges faced by director Marcel Carne, his cast, and his production staff. CHILDREN OF PARADISE seems to have been created inside a blessed bubble of imagination, protected from outside forces by the sheer power of its own being.The story is at once simple and extremely complex. A mime named Baptiste (Jean-Louis Barrault) falls in love with a street woman known as Garance (Arletty)--and through a series of coincidences and his own love for her finds the inspiration to become one of the most beloved stage artists of his era. But when shyness causes him to avoid consummation of the romance, Baptiste loses Garance to her own circle of admirers--a circle that includes a vicious member of the Paris underworld (Marcel Herrand), rising young actor (Pierre Brasseur), and an egotistical and jealous aristocrat (Louis Salou.) With the passage of time, Garance recognizes that she loves Baptiste as deeply as he does her... but now they must choose between each other and the separate lives they have created for themselves.While the film is sometimes described as dreamy in tone, it would be more appropriately described as dreamy in tone but extremely earthy in content. Instead of giving us a glamorous portrait of life in theatre, it presents 19th Century theatre as it actually was dominated by noisy audiences perfectly capable of riot, the actors usually poor and hungry and mixing freely with criminal elements, the desperate struggle to rise above the chaos to create something magical on stage. And while the film is not sexually explicit by any stretch of the imagination, by 1940s standards CHILDREN OF PARADISE was amazingly frank in its portrayal of Garance's often casual liaisons; American cinema would not achieve anything similar for another twenty years.Everything about the film seems to swirl in a riot of people, costumes, and overlapping relationships, a sort of mad confusion of life lived in a very elemental manner. And the cast carries the director's vision to perfection. Jean-Louis Barrault is both a brilliant actor and brilliant mime, perfectly capturing the strange innocence his role requires; the famous Arletty offers a divine mixture of exhaustion, sensuality, and self-awareness that makes Garance and her fatal attraction uniquely believable. And these performances do not stand in isolation there is not a false note in the entire cast, the roles of which cover virtually every level of society imaginable.With its complex story, vivid performances, and stunning set pieces, the film has a longer running time than one might expect, and some may feel it is slow; I myself, however, did not read it as slow so much as precise. It takes the time to allow the characters and their various stories to develop fully in the viewer's mind. I must also note that while a knowledge of theatre history isn't required to fall under the spell of this truly fascinating film, those who do have that background will find it particularly appealing. CHILDREN OF PARADISE is one of the few films that can be viewed repeatedly, one of the truly great masterpieces of cinema. Strongly, strongly recommended.Gary F.

It's hard to say more.In Paris of the 1840's on Le Boulevard du Crime, Carne's camera soars through sideshow entertainments of every description. The motion picture has just begun. No characters introduced. Already the audience is gasping, dizzy, lost in a swirl of romantic imagery. We are inside a theatre sharing the cheapest seats in the last row of the top balcony near the ceiling with the children of paradise. We forget ourselves and any notion that a film has to be realistic as we float along catching Carne's glimpse of this lost, fantastic era. The movie moves. It overflows with art and intelligence; we are totally under its spell of romance and beauty.As the story unfolds, we watch it in a daze. There is suffering and sudden death. But no leaden hand is telling us this is a stylized allegory dealing with the paralysis of an occupied France. This is the kind of film people make when they may die tomorrow we are compelled to receive it on the edge of our seat, every nerve tingling with desperate anticipation. We don't need to know that it was made between 1943-45 when some of the filmmakers were being hunted by the Gestapo, that starving extras stole banquets before they could be photographed.Every movement the performers make is studied, made perfect as though this would be the last time any of them were to act. Garbo interests you? Meet Arletty. The ideal twentieth century woman. Witty. Controlled. Passionate. When she comes to her lover she glides toward the camera, walking without the use of her feet. Impossible? Not this time.Jean-Louis Barrault playing Baptiste Debureau, the greatest French mime who created Pierrot (a pale, love-sick, ever-hopeful seeker after happiness) -- Barrault transcends the man's legend with elegant pathos. And the way he moves. Like a feather. How did he learn that?The man who taught him plays his father in the film. As a matter of fact, Etienne Decroux taught Marcel Marceau as well. What does Decroux think of Marceau's popular mime? Snarls, Walt Disney!Mime is serious to Decroux. At some of his performances if the audience interrupts with applause, he is insulted and immediately retires from the stage!In the film, we see Barrault do many of Decroux's mime exercises during moments of Debureau's performances. Does Decroux think this is a good film? It is said that when he views it, tears run down his cheeks as he mouths all the lines.But the film is not just about mime. Pierre Brasseur plays the most renowned romantic actor in France, Frederick LeMaitre. Decroux doesn't want him in his mime company at first because it's so obvious that he's an actor. Frederick gets his break when he mocks a playwright by turning the man's melodrama into a farce. Years pass and both actor and mime become successful. But the actor cannot play Othello because he is so vain nothing can make him feel jealousy. That's right Arletty cures him!And there are aristocrats, and murderers, and thieves. And the film is over three hours long without a break. And you will be surprised how fast those three hours disappear!You will be overcome with a feeling of ecstasy; you will sign, you will cry. And as your breath is taken away you will be left with so much you never knew before, that you always thought existed; something will have happened to you for the first time, and forever. Now is the time to fall in love with the best there is!

I won't say it's the greatest film of all time, because its scope is very narrow the mystery of the heart, the wayward course of love, the bittersweet joy and sorrow of lovers. Maybe that isn't so narrow after all, but it doesn't cover quite as wide a spectrum as other great films (seven samurai, casablanca, mahabharata, key largo etc). Nonetheless, this film belongs in that same company, for an unsurpassed portrayal of loves lost and won, and also the passion of art, a form of love expressing itself in public creativity, enriching the lives of many. Love between lovers enriches them alone; art enriches the world.The woman Garance is loved by 4 men in this film. Two of them, at least, are superb renditions of genius-in-creation the mime Baptiste, and the actor Frederick. Both are geniuses, but while Baptiste is silent, weak, and sad, Frederick is loud, powerful, irrepressively optimistic, courageous and generous. He is one of the greatest characters ever to grace the screen. He has one flaw his genius is so pure, he has a blind spot regarding the weaknesses of others. He cannot conceive of an emotion such as jealousy, and so can never play Iago - until Garance, the fallen woman, finally teaches him. The other character who may be a genius is Lacenaire, but he is a criminal genius. Evil, twisted, burning with hatred, he has only one true and honest anchor in society - his love for Garance. It doesn't save him, but it keeps him from being as bad as he could be.Without going into the whole plot (it's long and convoluted) the primary paradox relates to intersecting and disconnected paths of love between the characters. Garance is loved by 4 men, but she really only loves Baptiste. So does Nathalie, a sweet and simple girl, who has the courage to do what Baptiste can not she declares her love, and so they marry and have a child. Baptiste lacks the strength to take Garance when he has the chance, and so no one is happy - except maybe Frederick, he lives as life should be lived, and even the pain of losing Garance turns to gold in the alchemy of his art.But despite the pain, and the unhappiness, loss and death, the world of *enfants* is beautiful. It's a world where love and art mean more than success or failure, a world where money is irrelevant and the passion for life burns away the curtain between fantasy and reality. It's three hours of *paradis*!10/10, with a bullet through the heart.

Although I did not enjoy it as much as Renoir' s work, it must be said of course that it is one of the biggest and most ambitious and most elaborate films ever made in France. Technically I was amazed by the huge sets of the beginning representing the city of Paris in the XIX century  (le boulevard du Temple) and set in Nice, and the camera movements within the crowd. We have indeed to take into account the awful conditions in which the film was shot under occupied France and in co-production with an Italian company that retired when Sicily was occupied, in the mid-shooting. (Colin Crisp) Les enfants du paradise is for me a magnificent, huge story; it is for the cinema what Balzac and Victor Hugo were for literature in the XIX century; not only French, but the world's. A colossal masterpiece with a desperately long, elaborate plot and well-defined powerful characters that confront each other trying to find out in their intercourse the answer to metaphysical questions about love and life between fantasy and reality, just as Armes suggests. Les enfants du paradis boasts an entire collection of characters that make up a twisted action as a result of the confrontation of their personal characteristics. Baptiste Deburau, a real-life mime of the XIX century is the main character. As pointed out in class, many Freudian interpretations have been made about this character he is weak, he is unable to reach his desires (Garance), he does not want to accept the love he already has (the girl who desperately loves him), he is not a hero, but the very opposite someone who deserves the pity of the spectator; but also that of Garance and that of his public when he acts as a mime, the character (as usual) is always chased by fatality and sadness. He even wanted to commit sucide! Garance is a simple woman, as she says in the film. She is ambiguous. Some (the Cinemania magazine in Spain, for example) see her as a prostitute (remember the place where she used to work, her flair, or the strange character she was with and who accused her of stealing his watch -a client, a pimp?). Whatever she may be, she is a lonely woman looking for a lonely love. The four main characters of the film are in love with her, but in a different way each. Each one takes her in the way they want her to be -we see her in the arms of Lemaitre or the Count as though she was two different persons-, except for Baptiste, who at the end of the film will realize and chase his true love -although we do not know what happens at the end. Lemaitre is the man, the Don Juan, the witty, attractive and winning beloved artist. He is proud of himself and his public is proud of him. He provides some talented moments of witty puns or funny, twisted scenes -like the one in the theatre. But there are two things that he cannot obtain absolute art, in his own opinion only Baptiste has the genius; and absolute love, Garance, who she will love but only one night. However, he can manage it all, he is a scrounger and he will still enjoy his life as it comes. Lacenaire is an ominous, dark mixture of Lemaitre and Baptiste. He is proud as Lemaitre but triumph has cheated him -he is completely awkward as a writer. And he is resentful and sad as Baptiste. These two lead him into violence against his love, Garance and against the Count -I really enjoyed the scene of the murder the close-up and the grimace of Avril- which can also. The murder can also be taken as a rebellion of the resentful lower classes against the upper classes the image of the fallen, dead hand with the valuable ring is significant. The count is a symbol for the upper classes childish (his hairstyle, his expression are those of a young boy), whimsical, materialist, stuck-up, posh, he thinks he can achieve the love of Garance thanks to his influences (he saves her from the police) and wealth (notice the rich veil Garance wears at the beginning of L'homme blanc. But he will lose everything by hands of Lacenaire. Finally, I liked the character of the girl who is in love with Baptiste. She really reminds me of Éponine form Les Misérables by Hugo, the unrequited young girl in love with Marius, the main character. She wanders alone through the film, seeking the love of Baptiste, without success. And she plays the lead in one of the most bitter scenes in the film, about which we will talk later.The main topics in the film are love on one side and life between fantasy and reality on the other. Love is always present in various forms. A passionate love by Lemaitre, a platonic love by Baptiste, an unrequited love by the girl who loves him, a love bought with money, by the Count, a violent love, by Lacenaire. But Carné and Prévert really want to show that only a true, pure and simple love will prevail. That is the love Garance seeks and that only Baptiste will be able to give her at some point. 'Love is so simple' is one of the climax phrases, containing the key of love in the movie will first pronounced by Garance and later by Baptiste. However, there are some other bitter moments on the dark side of love at the end of the film, when Garance flees and Baptiste chases her, his wife will stand alone, in the middle of the room, still. The camera will stay with her, and we can see her reaction, that of a little child so suddenly and badly struck by betrayal. 'What about me?' So simple words that however struck me. There is in the movie a constant game between life and theatre. This has a lead role throughout both parts of the movie. We can see gorgeous and funny sketches by Baptiste (right at the beginning, when he meets Garance, and later on  his performances), and burlesque or sublime representations by Lemaitre. And in general a whole bunch of characters form the theater life will show off in the movie, and theater life itself can be seen in a close-up the owner of the theater des Funambuls, the three authors (victims of a bitter criticism and humor), the side characters. However, the climax of this close relationship between theater and life arrives in the scene where Lemaitre, who knows he can do whatever he wants on a stage, as he is a superstar, strays from the script and begins fooling around. He goes out to the stalls and then action bends over itself, and does not depend on the authors any longer the double game actor-spectator, fiction-reality reflexes itself in a witty dance. And Lemaitre leads us in the  confusion, what is real and what is not?. And that confusion is so funny for the public; and is also illicit, but Lemaitre is allowed to do anything within a theater. There is another moment where the characters of life (Garance, Lameitre and co.) long for being public again. At the beginning of the second part, Garance tells Lemaitre about the 'children of paradise', that is 'les enfants du paradis'. They are so poor, so happy, so irresponsible, up there in the cheapest seats! Just like children, as the title of the movie says. And Garance misses that, she misses that time of her life when she did not have anything to do with the Count or with the rich veil that covers her face. And the drawing from the cover of the film is meaningful too the children of paradise sitting and watching the rest of characters, as if they were real characters in a play. And all the characters are just watching the center around which all action spins their either beloved or hated Garance.

Because the fortunes of war are a reflection of the fortunes of life, which above all this film explores. All the cliches so familiar in everyday life - what goes up comes down; the fickleness of love; beauty in the midst of ugliness; the lonely sad sensitive soul; the unthinking happy-go-lucky mob; generosity; avariciousness - are here portrayed in breathtaking poetry of words, settings, camera angles, music that has never been equalled. The huge camera movements over and through the crowd at the start and end of the film make an indelible impression.And the performances!

I tried again four years older and it won me over. Personal tastes vary not only between people but within people over time. Nowadays I can't understand why some people can't understand it and get nothing from this timeless world classic - at the very least they could look upon it as the closest the French cinema ever got to Dickens.Meandering tale set in 1840's France has whimsically smiling Garance played by Arletty in love with mime artist Baptiste played perfectly by Jean-Louis Barrault but with three other men in love with her too. These are the Dramatic Actor Lemaitre played by Pierre Brasseur (Lucien from Le Quai Des Brumes), the cynically corrupt Lacenaire by Marcel Herrond (Renaud from Les Visiteurs Du Soir) and stiffly possessive Montray by Louis Salou. With Maria Casares as the faithful Nathalie the trouper in love with Baptiste and you have the main cast for your delectation. Just as the characters in the plays at the Funambules depended upon the pleasure of the audience up in the Gods so do the actors on the screen &#x96; although now thanks to TV and DVD us people up in the Gods are a lot more distant! The main thread is how and why all the tangled love affairs unravel. The film is littered with eccentric characters and heavy poetic observations, backed up with a logical plot, incredible sets and unforgettable acting &#x96; all made under the Nazi occupation. Adversity often heightens the senses, but Carne and Prevert excelled themselves with this production. Favourite bits Baptiste proving Garrance's innocence of stealing a watch in mime to the assembled crowd; the touchy scenes inside the aptly-named Robin Redbreast pub; Garance and Lemaitre in the deeply shaded box at the Funambules watching Baptiste perform; his calling her beautiful and her response of No, just alive, that's all; Lemaitre revising the play in which he was acting on the stage; his opinion of mulled wine &#x96; Like God slipping down your throat in red velvet breeches; Lacenaire's lacerated opinion of everything &#x96; especially of Montray; the bookend bustling street scenes at the start and finish; the astounding ending; and on and on &#x96; so much richness to see and hear in three hours!It's a world portrayed in great detail and lovingly, done in the best French tradition dreamy, full of poetry, a frisson of sex and a little violence. As with me, it may need a little patience to cultivate this particular flower, but if you allow it into your heart it will never leave you again. Definitely High Art!

The film tells of an unattainable beautiful courtesan named Garance (unforgettably played by Arletty who was over 40 and seemed not to care at all if she looked her age) and four men who love her - the famous mime Baptist (Jean-Louis Barrault is matchless), the actor, Frederick LeMaitre, the criminal Pierre-François Lacenaire, and the aristocrat Comte de Montray. She loved one of them and the affair was doomed.

It succeeds in creating its own world, and in allowing the viewer to live in it for a while. The characters become like old acquaintances, some friendly, some funny, some hateful, but all of them interesting.In no time at all, you are drawn into the world of the street and the theater, and all of the characters are introduced in such a way that you immediately know a great deal about them. The six main characters (Garance and her four admirers, plus Nathalie) are admirably conceived, and they also form a nicely varied set of personalities. Their loves, their schemes, and their lives become vivid and memorable, and it's almost as if you were a part of their circle. Arletty and the rest of the cast are all quite good, and many of the minor characters also become interesting and effective parts of the story.Not only are the settings nicely detailed and well-matched with the story, but the story itself avoids the conventional expectations of romances or similar stories, to show things in a believable and thoughtful way. While wholly sympathetic to almost all of the characters, neither does it do them any special favors just to conform with Hollywoodish conventions. They are thus not only believable, but easy to identify with.The story-line also has one feature that works out extremely well, in that it allows a gap of several years in the middle of the plot. It makes the characters that much more interesting when they re-appear, some changed and some exactly the same, and it sparks new interest in the old situations when they re-arise.Beyond all that, there are many worthwhile themes to consider. The Othello theme offers good, if obvious, parallels to the story, and all of the tangled relationships say a lot of things about human nature and its limitations. Knowing that the film was made during the occupation of France also adds some interesting angles. There's more than could ever be discussed in a short review, and Children of Paradise is certainly one of the fine classics that every cinema-lover should see.

It is difficult toget angry at any of the lovers, since they speak so truthfully to one another.The murderer himself is to be admired, since he can't admit to himself his love for Garance but winds up removing the wicked rich 'owner' of Garance. How was this allowed to be made under the Nazi occupation?  I can only guess that the connections between freedom and despotism that are easily made by today's viewer would be more difficult then.  Obviously, it is everyone's love for the theater, both mime, actor and writer, that is honored here. (The murderer prided himself on his writing skill.)The screenplay is excellent, dialogue inspired, and there is little of the duplicity you usually see today in such movies.  Garance, unable to love due to her own background as sex object, speaks tenderly to all and refuses to lie.  With one exception she agrees to speak to all of Paris of her love for the count, so long as HE knows she does not love him.Thought done skillfully, it is an old story of he loves her, she doesn't love him, she loves another, he doesn't love her back but only toys with her. If ever I saw a great example of why you must play Hard to get when playing the game of love, it's this one.  Take your teen age children to see this, and point out how the non-availability of Garance and Baptiste, as well, whet the appetites of the others.  watching my grandson's affection toyed with by a young girl just playing with love-- when he was smitten and straight with his feelings broke my heart, and I tried to explain to him what the game is at the age of 15.  This movie pretty well exemplifies the situation.The interweaving of 'Othello' with the lovers' stories, the murder of the old clothes man on the stage with the real old-clothes man complaining about his protrayal, are illustrations of life imitating art and vice-versa.

In France, the same part of the theatre is known as Paradis, presumably for the same reason.So a better English translation of the title of this film would be Children of the Gods. This translation reflects the double meaning of the French title, which conveys that we are seeing the children of heaven acting out for us their lives as if they were a play.It is difficult to pinpoint what gives this film its greatness, but I think that there is a clue in its title. It is a film that shows, in simple form, as in a simple play, some of the truths of life. Garance is the Eternal Woman beautiful, sensual, inconstant. Baptiste is the artist destined for unhappiness he loves Garance, but cannot accept her when she offers herself, as she refuses his demand for her to forsake all others. Natalie is unrequited love the man she loves does not love her in return. Lacenaire is the embodiment of evil; Edouard is the corrupt aristocrat. Frederic is the common man he takes the best of what the world offers and asks little in return except to be allowed to enjoy it to the full.The actors have little control over their parts. Even Baptiste, who devises his own mimes, produces the same story again and again,one that reflects his own life. The actors play out their parts before the audience every night, and the audience laughs or cries according to the run of the play.

Firstly, that it exists as a film that we can still watch and enjoy, and that it was made in the first place, let alone survive, is miraculous. But secondly, and just as importantly, it's remarkable that it exists as it is, vivacious, energetic, fun, interested in the art of filmmaking. In this respect it reminds me of Vigo, who made L'Atalante (1934) knowing he'd die sooner rather than later. The tragedy is tragic, the comedy is comic &#x96; everything works and it's impossible to think how cohesive the film is, considering it was made over several years. In other words, how amazing to have a film made in the bleakest of circumstances that still radiates with so much life. After the curtain literally opens the viewer is treated to three hours of the most amazing drama, comedy and visual filmmaking, as well as clever storytelling. We are thrown in the middle of a street, where everyone is giving a performance Lemaître flirts, Lacaneire gives a monologue (underlined by Garance, who says listening to him is like watching a play), and Baptiste, while acting, witnesses a crime and gives a performance of it in mime. The blind man isn't really blind but merely acting, and later on the love Baptiste and Lemaître have for Garance becomes a play not only once but twice, the latter instance written by some rather ordinary bloke called William-something.It's ironic that I have previously tried to watch the film at least twice, being unable to continue beyond the first twenty minutes (the reasons for this might not be numerous but too domestic to bother you with). But having now watched the film in its entirety, its flow and rhythm makes the time fly. In this respect it's very much like other longer epics (Shichinin no samurai, Lawrence of Arabia) that are somehow condensed into a speck of time, or should we say timelessness. I can't wait to see it again, which leads to the one teeny-weeny problem we fans have, because &#x97;Shamefully the film has been treated with a terrible high definition transfer of the film, and luckily this has been well-documented. Pathé apparently created a 4K scan of the original nitrate negative in 2011 (the work performed at L'Imagine Ritrovata in Bologna, Italy) and then reconstructed and restored in Paris by Eclair Laboratories. But what we have on the Blu-ray is far from wonderful, and only makes one wonder what the 4K scan might have looked like before the terrible digital noise reduction that's only matched by other similar disasters done in DNR to great films (Le samouraï and Madame De... come to mind, the former also a Pathé resto). The Criterion Collection disk in Region A suffers from the exact same problems as the Second Sight in Region B.

All the while she looks at herself - her face - in a mirror. This unmediated self-examination whilst being risqué but not absolutely honest with others is examined across a handful of characters, beginning with a blind beggar who is not blind and finishing with an entire population adopting the character of one individual.It is also the nature of art - that in order to examine people one must take recourse to what might seem an unnatural technique. This is clear in the acting and mime of the two stages of the neighbouring theatres and underlined in the persistent transgression of the fourth wall. Most clearly and simply the two celebrated actors cover their faces with paint-as-mask to achieve greatness - white for the mime, black for Otello.The performances are powerful, if mannered for the time, with the exception of Arletty as Garance who manages to be arch and seductive but warm, haughty and fragile all at the same time, an unrepeatable modern performance.

Though Carne is dealing with the colorful world of 19th century theater, the black and white film is perfect in projecting a dreamlike ambiance and a bittersweet sense of romance.Though the love square plot might make you believe this is some trite melodrama, let me assure you it absolutely is not that at all. This is a movie which examines lost chances, lost loves. It mourns the passage of time, especially when someone settles for less than what they truly want.

From fantasy to neo-realism, historical epic to kitchen sink drama, and with arguably the most important cinematic New Wave to add to its canon, French masterpieces can be found in almost every genre imaginable; indeed, in many cases, they have helped to distinguish between them.'Les Enfants du Paradis' is considered the finest product of the partnership between director Marcel Carné and writer Jacques Prévert. At over three hours, and split into two parts, the film follows a handful of colourful characters through the 1820s and 30s in that fascinating, mystical city Paris. The focus is on the Parisian theatre &#x96; a place of hypocrisy, deception, exaggerated emotion, corrosive artificiality, cheap tricks and crude laughs. With an astonishing attention to detail, and displaying a perfect mastery of his medium, Carné exposes with scorching wit the superficiality of society and the damaging effect it has had on his characters. There is a fine line between fantasy and reality, and the characters, sometimes without even knowing it, deceive themselves and the others around them. In a film with so many grand themes, its tragedy lies in its profound exploration of love, and what happens when genuine emotion attempts to shine through in a world of romantic, sentimental lies, cruel falsehoods, deluded pride and vicious crime.Much of the brilliance of this film I cannot divulge in my review. I admit, that aside from its considerable critical acclaim, I knew nothing about it when I bought my ticket. That is the way it should be seen let its delicious melodrama, breathtaking sets, classy cinematography, dry comedy and poignant tragedy wash over you. Long it may be, but the time flies by; very rarely have I been taken on as deep and enjoyable a ride as this one &#x96; and how refreshing that is, considering that those two adjectives seldom gel when talking about cinema. Even more impressive is that with so many characters, story lines and themes at play, the movie never once feels rushed or convoluted its pacing is pitch perfect, and its artistic vision - impeccable; the denouement is abrupt and delivers a memorable emotional punch to the gut.This is a timeless film for all tastes those who like a great plot, a compelling love story, lavish costumes, profound thematic material, passion and grand emotion, an insight into a different culture or a different time and place &#x96; this has everything, encompassing all of life &#x96; from the most pitifully poor to the most disgustingly rich. I personally cannot wait to see it again, and the newly restored version released recently by the BFI is definitely the way to go if you have the intention of watching it &#x96; the print, much like the film, is a joy to behold, almost doing full justice to the amazing cinematography (courtesy of Marc Fossard and Roger Hubert) and the delightful technical and stylistic flourishes found within it.I am not exaggerating when I say that this may well be one of the finest films ever made. It could be studied and analysed until the cows come home, but as is often the case for many truly great films, there is nothing quite like seeing it for the first time and just enjoying it for what it is, not feeling the need to try and analyse because you have complete confidence in the filmmaker and are utterly captivated by the story he is telling you. It was made over sixty years ago now, but it could have been released yesterday for the first time. It feels as fresh and exciting as ever - and that, for me, is the sign of a film to cherish!

There is a sympathetic abyss between sign and object, and at the beginning of the creation of every sign therefore stands the Great Sign Creator, God.

And no wonder, that the gigantic fairground which Carné presents in his epochal Les Enfants Du Paradis is a world in the world that is protected by the Sublime. I even think that Carné's typical style, which is the style of a merciful and enchanted marionette-player, shows that the sense of life does not consist in enforcing everyone's alleged free will, but to learn how to communicate, to interpret and to act in this highly artistic semiotic world.

Even if it had not been made under such difficult circumstances, it will still stand as a magnificent masterpiece. With a script by the poet Jacques Prevert and direction by Marcel Carne, it stars Arletty and Jean-Louis Barrault as its main characters, Garance and Baptiste Dubureau.The story takes place on the Boulevard de Crime in 1840s France, a street teeming with people and theater of all kinds. A mime, Baptiste (Barrault) becomes obsessed with a street woman, Garance (Arletty), a mysterious creature who becomes the artistic muse of two men, Baptiste and Frederick LeMaitre (Pierre Brasseur). Shyness keeps Baptiste from becoming Garance's lover, and he loses her to LeMaitre and others. Meanwhile, Nathalie (Casares) loves Baptiste and isn't afraid to say so. Garance finally realizes that she is as much in love with Baptiste as he is with her, but now they are both ensconced in other lives. What will they do? Les enfants du paradis is a dark film, going from intimate two-person scenes to massive crowd scenes on the boulevard, taking us into the dark alleys of Paris and the after-hours crowd in bars to the theater rabble-rousers, and demonstrating the power of mime in performance. This is a world of hungry actors, crooks, hustlers, casual sex, and great art.Only in France would a woman in her mid-forties be cast as a femme fatale - imagine Hollywood doing that in 1945. The Garbo-ish Arletty manages to be earthy and mysterious as Garance. The actress was not invited to the premiere of this film due to her fall from grace - she had a German officer as a lover during the war. In fact, she was arrested and spent time in a concentration camp, finally being put under house arrest. She did return triumphantly to film and worked until 1967, when blindness from an accident forced her to retire. She died in 1992 at the age of 94.The thin, sensitive looking Jean-Louis Barrault gives an exquisite performance as Baptiste, a role based on the real-life mime Jean-Gaspard Deburau, who invented the character of Pierrot. So successful was Barrault's pantomime work that it revived interest in the art form in France and made it possible for Marcel Marceau to become hugely popular. Barrault's performance is still studied in mime schools today. A passionate man, Barrault actually hid members of the resistance on the set of Les enfants du paradis. This film is long, it's talky, but it is fascinating and detailed in every aspect. A no-miss for both film and theater lovers.

The acting here is superb. The first appearances by the primary male lead characters, Frederick and Baptiste, are brilliant and hilarious. Baptiste's physical comedy in particular is a riot.The whole film is carried by the acting and dialog. There are a number of violent and sexual moments, but they all happen tastefully off-screen. The writing is so fantastic, replete with hilarious puns, arguments and inspired homages to Shakespearean prose. Seriously, this writing is STRONG. Take notes, fledgling screen-writers! But the tragic elements are emphasized too. The film is full of despicable characters, ironic and painful moments, and wisdom too great for the characters to ever grasp. Even some of the comedic moments have a twist of tragedy to them, with artists who have unwittingly evolved into caricatures of themselves, actors who have become themselves on and off the stage and dreams which are so large they make the person forget to pursue them (if that makes any sense).And how about the layered elements of the tale? The movie opens with curtains to reveal a story about brilliant actors who cannot see the width of the world stage they inhabit outside of their careers. Except it isn't like a post-modernist method of layered presentation because such a method of telling the story is never a focal point. It's simply a nice bonus that leaves you thinking about your own life after the curtains are drawn.Do we love ourselves, other people, or just the feeling of love that other people can evoke from us? Sometimes one is not in love, but only enamored by the other as a muse.

Basically actress and woman-about-town Claire Reine, who calls herself Garance (Arletty) has numerous men falling at her feet and in love with her, including the significant ill-fated relationship with theatre mime Jean-Baptiste Debureau (Jean-Louis Barrault), and also pretentious actor Frédérick Lemaîtr (Pierre Brasseur), conniving thief Pierre François Lacenaire (Marcel Herrand) and Count Eduard of Montray (Louis Salou). Baptiste has his own dilemma as well, as actress Nathalie (María Casarès) is in love with him, it was when Garance was accused of stealing a watch that she and he met, and Count Eduard protects her when she may have been arrested for the crime of Lacenaire. Years of separation for them, the real loving couple end up in relationships with the people they do not truly love, Baptiste with Nathalie who have a baby son together and goes on to become famous for his mime acting, and Garance with the Count and wants to find her true lover again. The couple do manage to spend a night together, even after Nathalie's attempt to sabotage their meeting by sending her child to foil it, while Count Eduard is discovered murdered, he was killed by Lacenaire. In the end Baptiste is separated from his love again after disappearing in the crowd who are running to escape an attack, and Garrance is forced to leave town in a carriage, completely oblivious to the fact that the Count is dead. Also starring Pierre Renoir as Jéricho the old clothes, Etienne Decroux as Anselme Debureau and Fabien Loris as Avril &#x96; Lacenaire's assistant. The acting, particularly from Arletty as the woman caught in a web of relationships and Barrault as the actor who is brilliantly expressive and funny with his silent act, I will confess that it was hard to follow all of what was going on, but that memorable scene of the comedy mime actor describing in silence the mistaken theft of the watch is fantastic, and there are other good moments, overall it is elegant classic period drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Screenplay. Very good!

This is the Paris of Chopin, Hugo, Ingres.  Les Enfants du Paradis brings it to life.I find the conclusion rather abrupt.  Lacenaire is forced, for the sake of the plot, into an action that doesn't seem in character for him. Frederick LeMaitre -- the most winning, purely charismatic character in the movie -- drops out in the final scenes, and his arc feels unresolved.  I am not sure if the 6 main characters' stories are tied together into any meaningful conclusion or revelation.  Perhaps they aren't intended to be.Still, there is much to admire in Les Enfants du Paradis.  It is a triumph of atmosphere, of evocation of setting; and it contains two immortal performances, in the characters of Baptiste and LeMaitre.

The film's main attribute in my opinion is its brutal honesty -- honesty about what it is and who it is about. Meanwhile the characters in the story go about their business often in a deceitful way, sometimes managing to fool themselves but never fooling us. The director makes all the contradictions so clear that they flow naturally from our understanding of the characters. The situations that develop are also only the natural extensions of character. There are no archetypes among the characters, except perhaps Frederick.Actually I feel as though any analysis of the film on my part is desperately hampered by the fact that I've just given it the first viewing. This film takes a long time to digest. I think the best way to proceed is along the lines where I see the film at this point -- as being an almost organic development from the characters. A lot of the inner truth of the characters can be discovered through looking at the way they each deal with the chaos and imperfection they encounter in the world around them.Emotionally, it's easy to get caught up in disliking the Garance character because on a surface level she's either a femme fatale or an infant terrible. I prefer to think more along the lines of the latter, but I think there's a sadness in her even before she discovers she's in love with Baptiste. There's a feeling of deliberation about all her acts, the way she speaks to Jericho in the early scenes but especially in her comportment with Baptiste on their magical night out which feels more than a bit tinged with desperation on Baptiste's part. Garance meets a strange and imperfect world with resignation, and when things don't work out the way she wants she easily accepts an alternative (for instance after Baptiste leaves she happily takes Frederick into her bed). Garance is a woman who is so accustomed to the winds of change and circumstance that she's unable to drop her world weary manner and seize her chance at love when it presents itself, largely because the concept of innocence is so alien to her.Baptiste is a pure spirit, and it's easy to see him as the maligned innocent even though his jealousy also causes everyone around him pain. His mime act is one of the film's visual high points, and like Frederick he is a consummate artist. Whereas Jericho only sees himself as an artist, a kind of Dr. Mabuse master criminal. The purity of Baptistse's spirit comes out through his art, yet as the film goes on his art becomes more and more painful and less humorous. When Baptiste first does a pantomime to illustrate the nature of Jericho's theft and to prove Garance's innocence, he does not seek any reward or any gain for himself. In fact up till the point he speaks up it doesn't even occur to anyone on the scene that he could describe the events. But as his art becomes deeper he becomes a star and his art is laced with the signs of his need and his hunger. It was however the fact that Baptiste set conditions on his love with Garance while Frederick accepted her as she was which set the whole tragedy in motion. Baptiste is a dreamer, he has a vision of how he wants the world to be and will not accept any other version. The pain he causes is not deliberate but only the product of his lack of concern about things that do not fit his dream.Baptiste is a creator -- he can only accept the world on his own terms and he doesn't so much seek to change what he needs into the way he wants it to be (Garance) as he is inclined to ignore the imperfections and retreat back into his dream world. His art expresses his need to either have a perfect world or to die and leave the world he cannot be happy in, but the other people around him need him and demand that he help them with their own problems. All that matters to him is his own vision of perfection (his art, Garance).Frederick is an actor -- he does not create the world that he wants to live in and he does not have a dream world like Baptiste, rather he finds things in the world such as they are and uses them for his own purposes. He is single-minded in purpose and rather self-centered. Even his love for Garance is tinged with self-worship -- he seems to see her as a fellow creature with similar desires to his and a perfect compliment to his lifestyle. But this also is a source of his strength, and of the story's 4 characters he's clearly the strongest. When he faces the fact that Garance will never love him, he becomes overjoyed with the realization that he can now use his very jealousy itself to make his performance in Othello a great one.Jericho is a relatively minor character in this equation, but he too sees himself as an artist, and when he encounters the chaos in the world around him his reaction is to murder it. He sees himself as above the rules of the game; his multiple identities are actually a way to hide the fact that he has no innate identity.All in all, a fantastic film both visually and in terms of character and story. I plan to return to it again in the future and hopefully gain more clarity with the larger story now in context in my mind.

Animating Jacques Prévert's script is a multi-layered meditation on the nature of performance, ranging from a vivid illustration of contrasting dramatic modes (Barrault's mime needing only gestures, Brasseur's Shakespearean actor relishing the music of words) and a consideration of the interchangeability of theatre and life (as Herrand's frustrated playwright Lacenaire elects to channel his genius into crime), to a wry acknowledgment of the social relevance of performance (all three men are captivated by Arletty's insouciant whore, who acts herself out of their depth to achieve the protection of a Count, establishing a social barrier which Lacenaire promptly breaches in his elaborate stage management of the Count's murder). Flawlessly executed and with a peerless cast, this is one of the great French movies, so perfectly at home in its period that it never seems like acostume picture, and at over three hours not a moment too long.

Lots of melodramatic excess, so much that it annoys. It is very French in that way -- drearily fatalistic and romantic. But it is also typically French in the element that makes it exceptional and intelligent it is a deeply self-referential exploration about the manner of performance and writing for performance. And in that respect it is perhaps the standard of excellence.(Both of these qualities are also the driver behind the similarly structured 'Amelie' and Moulin Rouge)'Citizen Kane' and 'Annie Hall' exploit many different narrative devices, in parallel and conflicting. But they are only mildly self-referential. Not so here the film itself starts off with a rising curtain and trusts us directly into a world (literally a street) where everyone is a performer. Then it runs through all sorts of narrative acrobatics...It is a history of French performing arts. This is not so interesting to this viewer, except for an appreciation to detail. What impresses is the structure. Like Kubrick's '2001,' the entire project is a struggle among four men, each involved in the theater, for control over the story. They do that on screen of course, but all of them will go on afterward to write a play. Whose play are we seeing? Clearly all four, battling before our eyes. We have the four types of narrative moving back and forth in influence. In two cases, we see the background plays of two of these (the traditional mime, the 'Othello'), both terminated by Garance.

Happily, this is not the case with Les Enfants du Paradis. It most certainly lives up to its reputation as one of the greatest films ever made.Most people are aware of the stories surrounding the production of this film during the Occupation and it is extraordinary that such a work of art was completed under such trying conditions.The main theme of the film is that truly satisfying love remains just out of reach. The main characters are involved in a series of liaisons that explore their differing romantic needs. Ultimately, none of them find fulfillment.The epic scale of the film and the colourful array of characters would be worthy of Victor Hugo or Charles Dickens. The depth of the characterisation was unprecedented at the time and would saw cinematic art raised to a whole new level.The character of Baptiste is central to the story; he is a sad clown both on and off the stage as his hesitation and shyness lead to him losing his one true love. His unhappy love life ironically contrasts with his growing fame as a genius of mime. The nearest equivalent to Baptiste's plight is perhaps that of the gatekeeper's son, John Chivery, in Dicken's masterpiece, Little Dorrit.Garance is selfish in her rejection of Baptiste yet finds some small degree of redemption on seeing his child and feeling sympathy for it.The film contains many plays within plays and virtually every style of performance art is utilised, from pantomime to dance, from Shakespearian tragedy to street theatre. (As an aside, the film also covers how mime evolved from a crude form of mass entertainment to the sophisticated French cultural art it is today. Indeed, the mime performances presented in the film are sublime.) The notion of plays within plays is also reinforced by the device of the curtains raising and falling on each act of the film itself. We are aware that we are watching actors playing actors, yet we are still drawn into their world and the truths they present to us.A delightful moment in the film is when the Shakespearian actor decides he prefers realistic stories, if only two acts long, that contain the truth, perhaps an ironic reference to the two-part Les Enfants du Paradis itself which maybe the scriptwriters were realising conveyed an abundance of truth.Despite its long running time, the film maintains a good pace and never slackens into tedium. The various threads are drawn together in towards the inevitable but deeply satisfying conclusion. None of the characters will ever find happiness for true romantic love is unattainable, the stuff of plays and fictions only. Yet, their striving for it is what gives them impetus. A beautifully ironic moment is when Baptiste, the great clown, is prevented from catching up with Garance when she leaves for the last time, by a mocking array of tacky imitation carnival clowns. His own personality is mirrored back at him and it is this that prevents him ever reaching his one true love.The tone of the film mixes the serious and comic superbly as, again, a nineteenth century literary master such as Dickens or Hugo would have done as the lives of the impoverished, cunning street performers is turned into high art and film itself reaches the same height as great literature.The cinematography is subtly and neatly summarises all of the lessens learned in the half-century since the birth of the art form.To summarise, this truly is one of the greatest films ever made, both for its execution, use of literary and cinematic techniques and the depth of its themes. Essential viewing.

Often hailed as France's greatest movie, it's undoubtedly an event, and has an epic feel to it, even though the story takes place in one small part of Paris over a space of a few years.Arletty (incredibly, closing in on 50 when she made this), plays Garance, a woman taking part in a sideshow attraction when we meet her, who meets a young mime artist, Baptiste (Jean-Louis Barrault) who quickly falls under her spell. Arletty is also friendly with the marvellously roguish Pierre-Francois Lacenaire (Marcel Herrand), who initially claims to have no feelings for her but who is, in truth, as besotted as Baptiste. It's Frederick (Pierre Brasseur), a budding actor, with whom Garance has an affair however. Until, that is, she is falsely accused of robbing a debt collector and must call on the help of wealthy admirer Abril (Fabien Loris).That this film ever got made at all is something of a miracle. It took eighteen months, in the midst of a world war which saw financial backers bailing out as the tide of that war turned. It sheltered refugees from the Nazis and gave them work on its crew, even as its leading lady conducted an affair with a Nazi officer. That all involved managed to create something so close to masterful under such trying conditions is, therefore, something of a minor miracle.This film contains individual scenes that achieve brilliance and that will stay with you to such a degree that you might be tempted to play just this scene or that every now and then to remind yourself of its brilliance. Despite including real characters, it creates a strangely isolated world of lovers and rogues, artists and drunks, tramps and eccentrics whose interplay is entirely believable, as too is the diverging paths through life each takes as they eventually converge once more to reach a tragic finale. The literate dialogue might be a little flowery on occasion, but the sophistication and depth of the story &#x96; just try imagining an American film from the same period, stifled by the restrictions of the Hays Code and the studio system, that could claim to come anywhere near to what this one achieves &#x96; draws the viewer in and immerses it in its world.The story is essentially a study of the various forms of unrequited love, of the way it can become a controlling force in a person's life, give them hope, or lead them to despair. Each character in the film is largely moulded into what they become by their love, which is why, perhaps, it ends in the way it does, because this is one of the few films where you can truly believe that the characters and the story will still go on once the film is over, and that the surviving characters' feelings for one another will never change.The film is long, but each scene is used with such incisive skill by Carne and writer Prevert to inform the audience of the thoughts and emotions of the characters that the time flies by and you come to understand them so well that, when the film is finally over, you really don't want to leave.

As I've mentioned before, there are perfect movies that are dull; this is a perfect movie but it is anything but dull, even at the great length of 3 hours.Yes, the story is magnificent and the acting splendid. Yes, the cinematography is stunning and the sheer magnitude of the crowds filmed unbelievable (I have NEVER seen a film with so many people). What's perhaps most important with this film is something few people ever discuss--the editing. In addition to having perfect pitch, the film also has perfect pacing. It never drags. Yes the action slows down and speeds up (look to that initial segment in Part II, which seems as though it will overwhelm that portion of the film (it's about a half-hour long, I believe) but never does). Even excellent long films like Heat or Magnolia or Fanny and Alexander seem to have dull lulls; this one does not and seems half its length.And then there are all the other wonderful things about this film--the brilliant performances by the leads and supporting actors, a melodramatic story that is ambitious and could never be made by a major motion picture company today, the gorgeous photography that, I think, looks akin to sparking silver.Les Enfants du Paradis is maybe not the greatest French film (sorry, that award goes to The Rules of the Game), but it's as close as anything else comes. It's everything you look for in a movie--emotions and beauty--and, to my mind, it's terribly similar to one of the greats of American cinema. No, I'm not referring to Gone with the Wind (which, to me, is similar only in scope) but to Casablanca inasmuch as Curtiz's finest achievement carries a similar tone to this picture. Watch this film immediately if you have any familiarity with old American or European cinema or if you consider yourself a film lover. I'm ashamed I waited so long to see it myself.

Maybe there are things lost in the translation. It's basically a romance melodrama. I know that this was made during the Nazi occupation. I can certainly see the emotional connection that entails especially for the French. I understand perfectly how difficult this must have been to put such a large production on the screen. As a movie, this is merely a well-made melodrama and not much more. I really like the extended scene of the play. It's a good movie but it's a little disappointing.

While on-screen it featured aristocrats concerned with love, on set the crew were hiding from the Nazis and concerned with their next meal. It's a surprise that their anxiety didn't transfer over onto the otherwise leisurely film. It's unusually long, especially as it's in two parts where the first ends rather anti-climatically. But its images are beautifully textured, especially in its simple but adventurous shooting. However, although the network of characters is great, I was never too invested in the protagonist or the theme. Instead, it's all about its lush bittersweet tone and that's exactly how its theme is treated.

I understand it was shot under almost impossible conditions during the Nazi occupation and the cast and crew are held in an esteem almost Olympian in height.Helas, it seemed to drag for me. Three hours of a mime pursuing a flirtatious woman who attracts all kinds of men, high and low. It's a long time and I had some trouble keeping my eyes open. God knows, I'm not asking for the kind of warp-speed movies we're bombarded with today, nor does everything need to be dumbed down to the level of a grade-school kid. But, really, it could have been snipped here and there and been more of an eyeball magnet than it is. There's a good ten minutes, for instance, of a mime's performance on the stage of a kind of Commedia del'Arte. He prances in silence with a child, a blustering policeman, and a coquettish laundry woman. The mime is no Marcel Marceau, and nothing comes of the performance that couldn't be communicated in two minutes. Instead, we watch him for ten.And I couldn't figure out why all the men fall for Arletty. As Randolph Scott said in one of his Westerns, She ain't ugly. But she ain't exactly enchanting either.The film's longueurs stretch on and on, like the Street of Crime, as far as the half-open eye can see. Nothing much happens. A bit of trouble with the police. A duel. The mime beats a huge bouquet of flowers to death. Some suggestive dialog that must have seemed wicked in 1945. Mostly people stand on a stage and play catch with words.It's said to be the Gone With the Wind of French cinema. I've seen enough of Gone With the Wind for one lifetime too. However, Gone With the Wind has its adoring fans. So does The Sound of Music, though, and that's bound to induce some sort of digestive problem in a viewer who is not a fan. Les Enfants has its fans, including some people whose opinions I respect, so maybe others will get more out of this than I was able to.

Love can take many disguises, always commands and never compromises. Love is the true master of our ill-fated lives, and when it perishes through jealousy survives, for the flame of hate in an indecent symmetry, is only the rotten fruit falling from love's tree ~~~~~~~~~~ Love is a theater when only hearts can talk, love is a tightrope on which only souls can walk ... when guided by their feelings' purity, or a friendly smile haunting for eternity. Born from a surprising encounter, an innocent flower or an eternal thunder, love is the ultimate soul-player, its sources are infinite and damages definite, it erases in one instant all the life's meanings, and paints the truest words with the most painful feelings. What a glorious portrait that love is, floating in the air like an innocent breeze ... but roaring like the most ferocious storm, when it takes its deepest, sincerest form ~~~~~~ There was once a pretty flower, smelling like the most hypnotic power, her name was Garance, a lady whose first glance, melted your heart or tore it apart. There was Frederick Le Maitre aka the Master Fredrick, the greatest actor who knew every trick, as an actor, he was not just the one but the only one, but as an actor, he was also both anyone and everyone. His life was a never-ending play, a game he'd got to win anyway, except for Garance, beautiful Garance, who belonged to anyone and everyone, and when a woman belongs to no one, jealousy belongs to everyone. Now to Lacenaire, incarnation of fear, anger and frustration in his heart he nourishes, and everything he touches he inevitably tarnishes, more than anyone, the society he loathes, and he turns the words like he slits the throats, with an immaculate ruthlessness and a flawless precision, he's only distracted by one blinding vision, the only light of beauty in the ugliness of France, the one and only, the beautiful Garance. But only one word with Garance could rhyme, it was the silence, the silence of the mime. It was Baptiste who was given the rose, the true meaning of love, he finally knows, he can't get Garance off his mind, a treasure he'll never, never, ever find. But love is made of cruel irony, the most priceless treasures can be bought with money, bought when she needed one person to count &#x85; on, and she found De Montray, the Count, who rhymed Garance with the word 'Providence' through one of these cruel ironies of fate, but Garance knew the way was never straight ~~~~~~ And here begins the glorious tragedy, of the purest soul of silent comedy, and Garance, romantic, joyful and street-wise, in the French masterpiece Children of Paradise ~~~~~~ They belong to the lowest class of French society, they are as young as the new romantic century, for their bodies' comfort hardly matters, they sat on the highest spot of popular theaters, whose unlikely name was Paradise, the place from which the greatest laughs rise, costing less than a worthless dime, even covering the 'noise' of the pantomime. Always sincere and never silly, these are the hearts pounding of Vox Populi, real people who don't need words so the passion can touch their sensitive chords ... that's entertainment in its pure simplicity, that's entertainment in its simple purity. Theatre is love, it's the velvet glove, on the hand of life, that can carry a knife ~~~~~~~~ One could kill you in your deepest core, love was a play with no encore, and everyday was an eternal premiere, maybe written by the villainous Lacenaire. Or life was an eternal self-parody, where you could make a star out of anybody ... or it might be a tragic pantomime, a bleeding heart for an timeless time ... or did it need all the excess, when love was simply a need to possess, a need to be, to win, to conquer, to find the eternal question's eternal answer, an answer that desperately shut its name ... love is anything and never the same, one victory for a thousand defeats, one little smile emerging from the streets. Baptiste won that smile, in the theater of reality, and relived its loss as an eternal tragedy, stage was the theater of a never ending mourning, a cruel and painfully silent feeling &#x85; and even a beautiful family, or the true love of poor Nathalie couldn't erase one simple night's remembrance, the one that rhymed with the beautiful Garance ~~~~~~ Spectacular, stellar, than life bigger and love stronger, epic, frenetic, noisy and rowdy, witty and wise &#x85; this is the inner beauty of Children of Paradise, prodigious, glorious, sumptuous, miraculous, this is a miracle like only Cinema could have provided, an epic tale in two parts divided  Boulevard of Crime where the flower meets the Mime, and The Man in White or the finale of the fight. One of the most endearing cinematic romances, served by a colorful gallery of magnificent performances, on every level it reaches perfection, delightful experience of a poetry in motion, Garance, Frederick, Baptiste or Lacenaire, with immortal lines from Jacques Prevert, open your hearts' doors &#x85; like Paris is small for those who share ... so great a passion as ours. It's Marcel Carne's epic of passion, call it Gone with the Wind, the French Version, that speaks to the heart and defies the reason, in every world's part and in any season ~~~~~~ The Greatest Film ever made in France &#x85; the most universally emotional romance &#x85; the love story of Baptiste and Garance &#x85; that I salute with a respectful reverence.

Might not be the exact quote, but it's Shakespearian roots, at the least, and a well known adage at that. In this film by Marcel Carne, it's brought around in its reverse form All staging is life. This is a movie full of staging, and all that staging represents those aspects of life that concern themselves with being stage-like.The movie is at its simplest form a story about a woman in Paris who gets mixed in with the theatrical world of the Crime Street populace, with four men who fall in love with her and devote themselves to loving her as much as possible--she, of course, is used to such advances and because of such finds love easy and fitting, and enjoys their company even if she has preferences. Big lovers don't like easy love, and we get the various drama that comes from that source.It's a Shakespearian tragedy and a farce, at the same time. The characters paint their faces and mock and preen in order to get what they want, but it's so much more simple than they are willing to imagine. However that doesn't stop Garance from doing her own posing, as she's pretty much required to anyway.It involves some stunning performances, especially since they have to be layered into the actor's world itself. Each character has many parts to play in many aspects of the plot. It's very interesting to note that for its 3 hour 10 minute running time (Criterion release), it's actually quite concise, cutting to the bare bones of the story where it had many opportunities to sidetrack.--PolarisDiB "}{"Title":"A Love Quadrangle, and a Very Long Movie","Date":"19 April 2006","Score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" The mystery of Woman has been the root of all of Man's desire, and more often than not, that desire has been as sublime as it has been devastating. Arletty, hardly a beauty and already well past her prime to be playing a role of a courtesan desired by half of Paris, has that worldly look about her -- the old eyes, the slurred speech, the husky voice, and an overall air of inaccessibility within her accessibility -- that is right for the part of Garance, a part that has made her immortal throughout the years. Her role has been compared to that of Scarlett O'Hara in GONE WITH THE WIND but the only similarity would have to be their gender; otherwise, these are two very different women, O'Hara being an irrepressible, flighty tease, Garance being well aware of her position in society and unwilling to give that up for love.Love is coincidentally, what guides the plot of CHILDREN OF PARADISE. Every main player in the story is in love with who he or she cannot have. Arletty herself is depicted in the way she can only be seen as Truth, gazing at herself coldly through a mirror she holds in her hands, sitting in a water tank -- an image of surreal beauty closer to Dalinian art. She is merely an illusion for men, carnal desire that can offer only suggestions and emotions of the moment, but who is, as she herself states later on to Baptiste's young son, alone. Baptiste is the mime who defends her against a charge of theft and is repaid with a rose. He falls in love with her just like that, and from then on, he can't think of anyone else but her. The thing is, once he has the chance to consummate his love -- he bypasses it, and at this point, she accepts the advances of an aspiring actor, Frederic Lemaitre.But Frederic would rather be loved by the theater, so he also can't give himself entirely to Garance. Garance, in turn, is also being courted by Lacenaire, who would spill torrents of blood to give (her) rivers of diamonds, and believes he may have her when in fact she is the mistress of the Count Edouard de Montray who can give her monetary comfort. It's this turn of events that has Baptiste and Garance meet again, but this time they're both engage to other people. The tone of CHILDREN OF PARADISE becomes a little less focused here, and this is possibly due to the length of the story which clocks in at three hours. Garance, being almost omnipresent in the first half, The Boulevard of Crime is seen close to a support player in the second half The Man in White although her presence is no less important.CHILDREN OF PARADISE has enough back-story as much as the story it's telling on screen, but that stuff has been covered by film thespians who have written enough information about French cinema during the Second World War. To me, it's a very well made movie but if it were just a minute longer and I'd have thrown myself out the window. That said, it prevented me liking it more even when I see its value -- with performances that may come a little mannered here and there, but is in tune with the times and styles of acting in the first half of the 20th century. It does retain a novel approach to its story in which conflicts remain unsolved, Garance has a marvelous, protracted exit from the screen amidst a crowd, and I was left with a sense that even when the story seemed a little choppy here and there, it was one that would linger on due to its stately beauty.

No one did it better in the late thirties/early forties than Carne and Prevert and here they are both on top of their game.  It is interesting that so many comments come from the U.S.A. where they do not have the secondary meaning of 'gods' that exists in England and France - the cheapest seats in the gallery of a theatre, almost always occupied by genuine lovers of the theater who cannot afford the dearer stalls (orchestra in the US) seats, thus opening the meaning of the title as poor but genuine theater lovers, true 'children of the gods'. I and anyone would be hard put to improve on the superlatives already heaped on this masterpiece but it may be as well to remind ourselves that the bigger they are the harder they fall.  After a succession of successes culminating in this, the Carne/Prevert team followed up with 'Les Portes de la Nuit' which was the most expensive film ever made in France at the time and which was a total disaster both critically and commercially, so much so that the writer and director never worked together again.

The sets have a baroque, grandiose quality of the kind you see in opera sets--which is fitting, since this film is about theatre and the role it plays in both the lives of those who use it to make a living and those who turn to it as an escape from their own realities.I wonder if Ingmar Bergman was at all influenced by this film when making Fanny and Alexander. Certain parts, and an overall tone, in the second half of Bergman's film reminded me very much of Carne's.Grade A- "},{"Title":"Lovely, but a tad too long","Date":"22 January 2008","Score":"5 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" It's interesting--all the reviews for this film (except one) were very, very positive. While I did enjoy it very much, I do wonder if perhaps this excellent film is a tad overrated. Several reviewers called it the greatest French film ever made and one reviewer went so far as to say it was the best film ever made. I wonder...did these reviewers see other French films? After all, with so many fantastic films, is this overly long film truly the very best--I don't think so, though I did enjoy it.First, what I liked The feel for the 19th century town and all the riffraff and denizens of this community were excellently realized. The film had a great feel and it truly looked like it was a time tunnel through which you could see the people--particularly in the street scenes. Also, much of the time Baptiste was performing (in particular his first scene when the fat man is robbed), I was in awe of his skill--even though I am not a huge fan of mime. Also, I liked the way the film ended--brilliant.But what did I dislike? For the best film ever, CHILDREN OF PARADISE seemed way too long and its momentum wasn't sustained throughout the film. In addition, while I liked Baptiste and saw him as a fundamentally decent man, it was inconceivable that he'd sleep with Garance near the end of the film and that he would try to run off with her when he had a beautiful son and loving wife. This just seemed to undo all the decency and sweetness that Baptiste had previously displayed.Still, artistically speaking, this is one of the best French films I have seen--and as an American, I've actually seen quite a few (several hundred). But as for it being the best, I suggest you see a few other films from this great cinematic nation such as LA FEMME DU BOULANGER, LE CORBEAU, LES PARAPLUIES DE CHERBOURG, GRAND ILLUSION, JÁCCUSE and many other films before you crown ENFANTS DU PARADIS the greatest. Great? Probably. But with so many other wonderful films and this film having a few problems (mentioned above), I just can't elevate this movie to greatest status.

The characters in the film have no great cause to defend. They live for lust and that's it.It's a superficial film of superficial people - only the tramp seems to have something to say but he is cut short in every scene he is in.It's said that Carné was a homosexual. That's said about Charles Laughton as well but his only film (The Night of the Hunter) is quite a different film from this one. Laughton's film is very much about love.This is in many ways a strange film but stranger still is the praise of it. It's like a mass-psychosis because there's very little in this film to praise. Most of the actors or actresses are not as beautiful as they are supposed to be which ads to the strangeness of the film. Maybe it's all just homosexual somehow? "},{"Title":"Shut up! We can't hear the pantomime!","Date":"25 September 2004","Score":"3 out of 31 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  A-la Moulin Rouge, this film takes you the viewer into a second setting. Instead of you sitting on your couch watching the events unfolding before you, you actually are on your couch in a theater watching a play of the film. Sound confusing, this wasn't even the hard part about it. I didn't like so many items of this film. First, there was too much of a break between the two discs. Six years passed between the first disc and the second, and it is difficult to pick up where this film begins. I think this was the hardest part for me in this film. After trying hard through black and white photography and in French with subtitles, I finally began to understand what all of these characters were about, but then the second disc begins and I have no clue what is happening anymore. It is almost as if I need to start back on square one. Another part that infuriated me was the tone of the first and second disc. I really felt the creators should have just put the entire 3 hours 10 minutes on one disc ... I mean we all made it through Titanic didn't we?!? Instead, our emotions are toyed with more than Santa on Christmas. In the first disc all of our characters are brought together by love and happiness. It is that initial feeling of love that sparks that glimmer in the eye of our characters. As we begin to fall in love with them one by one, we are immediately torn away from them with a much darker and sinister second disc. On this disc there are duels, deaths, and even adultery. I suppose the director was hoping to show that while love is a many splendid thing ... it may lift you up where you belong, it is cruelly followed by people that cannot handle love, and therefore use techniques like revenge and murder to triumph where they could not before. There was so much about this film that I didn't like that I could literally spend days going into it all. Instead, I am going to end it with this thought ... If you are going to create a love story, instead of having a hexagon love shape, instead have two people. It may give the viewers a chance to actually fall in love with the characters and see the point that you are trying to make. The best film from France ... rubbish I say ... I think I heard a hogwash from the back. Whatever you do avoid this film at all costs!Grade * out of *****  "},{"Title":"Let down by, well... everything","Date":"17 October 2004","Score":"13 out of 66 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" The 'tragic' tale of an incredibly beautiful woman who is loved by every man she meets, and the clown she can never have.The tragedy is the fact that the 'incredibly beautiful woman' is played by some trout-faced old minger.You have better things to do than to waste three hours watching this boring, pointless, badly written crap. If it was a Hollywood film it would be laughed out of town. Unfortunately, I have to fill up ten lines or this review won't get posted, so I'd like to take this opportunity to say that, believe it or not, there are some really good foreign language black and white films that won't bore you to tears - The Wages of Fear is brilliant, All Quiet on the Western Front is great, La Grande Illusion is pretty good, but avoid Ladri di Biciclette - it's bloody awful.
