The presentation of Evelyn Stevens (Tilda Swinton, of Orlando fame) in Female Perversions, is not the sugar-coated world of The View, but a carefully crafted life-study (accurate to the minute details).Evelyn is an attractive woman, she believes herself a beautiful one. She inappropriately wonders through a shop while trying on a revealing piece of underwear, but the only one available is a disinterested octogenarian. She is a competent attorney, yet she represents herself as a premier legal strategist. Her credit card is rejected while making the simplest of purchases, she drives a SAAB 900 Turbo-the whole thing is perfect.Further insight to Evelyn's internal monsters are seen though the film's portrayal of her sister, Madelyn-the good soul to Evelyn's evil one. She has chosen a more bohemian existence, and calms her internal monsters through adventures in kleptomania.Let's recap Driven woman, faux life, dysfunctional family, bad credit cards, soon to be made a judge (with no one to tell, and no one who cares). There is only one place left for her to go.To a deeply invested lesbian encounter. Where else can she go? Her entire life as it stands is moments from implosion. The realization that the new lawyer entering her firm (her &#145;replacement') is prettier (Paulina Porizkova, no less), smarter, and likely more stable further pushes Evelyn to the inevitable.Wonderfully cast with Amy Madigan (as the sister), Karen Sillas (as the Doctor/Lesbian love interest), and Clancy Brown (as the boyfriend) in a rarely seen beefcake role. Throw in Frances Fisher and Laila Robins  for good measure.Must for all art film fans. Highly recommended for the more mainstream tastes who like a small distraction now and then.

While some of the allusions and metaphors can be a bit heavy handed, they are effective.Eve (Tilda Swinton) is a lawyer about to be nominated for a judgeship. While her professional life is as much as she could wish, her personal life is a mess. She is involved with an architect (male) and a psychotherapist, Renee. But she is unable to connect with either. Her upbringing, devotion to her work, and desperate desire for control have left her emotionally stunted, unable to make a real connection to anyone around her.One day, her sister is picked up for shoplifting. Eve rides to her rescue, and spends several days in the middle of nowhere, with an exotic dancer, a young girl just entering puberty, and a brilliant but shattered friend.Many critics hated this movie (most guides give it just 2 or 3 stars) but I think they couldn't get past Eve's coldness. But this movie is a study in coldness, in emotional death and rebirth. But it is not Eve who is reborn. See it and judge for yourself.

(You do get to see a glimpse of a naked Clancy Brown). We were the only ones sitting through the credits trying to figure the movie out and exchanging ideas about what the heck the images, let alone the story line meant. Best were the fantasies and nightmares as images of a successful woman's underlying insecurities.But what a cop-out to do what seemingly all contemporary fiction does this days - blame it all on parental child sexual abuse. And I thought the sexual interpretation of kleptomania had been discredited 50 years ago (at the turn of the century women shoplifters were cured with hysterectomies!).

I'm not sure whether that reflects the proportions of those who saw the movie - or merely those who were (generally) irritated enough to comment on it. The movie is confused. **** SPOILERS **** Very early on, we hear a ludicrous argument by the protagonist in court, one that would provoke laughter in any courtroom, yet there are only sober gazes in response. Why? No one would ever say We must smash him, crush him etc. unless they wanted to torpedo any sympathy toward their client. The argument is so funny - yet no one laughs. Why? Later, we hear the protagonist's partner's assessment that the protagonist is a killer and therefore a desired judicial appointee. The viewer laughs again - we've seen how poor a lawyer the protagonist is (though briefly) and the idea that the killer nature of the lawyer in a civil suit would somehow cause anyone to predict how she would be as a criminal judge - is again ludicrous. (Later, we learn that the Governor is so FAR from eliciting hard-line responses from his potential judicial nominee, that he happily talks about the joy of his five daughters!). So, the viewer assumes we are meant to believe that the protagonist and her partner are deluded in their assessments of legal realities - yet we learn nothing further to confirm the protagonist is a poor lawyer and the partner a deluded man. Why? We see some bizarre store in which only a few articles hang on hangers -and in which old men sit in the lingerie section watching women who parade in front of him (and the mirror). Why are old men allowed to sit there? And again, since the protagonist is an extremely thin woman, when she asks time and again whether the garment is too small - and hears voices telling her she's fat - we are again distanced from the protagonist's sense of reality. We can't trust what she believes about anything later in the movie. We see a sweet and charming new associate interviewing at the firm - however she speaks negatively about the new lipstick she (and the protagonist) have bought - and has therefore brought down the enduring deep loathing and profanity of the protagonist. This is rather funny since lipstick color is perhaps one of the least important decisions in anyone's life. So, of course it distances us from the hating protagonist - yet why should the movie so want us to be distanced from the protagonist? To see her as a foul-mouthed, promiscuous, person easily roused to hatred by superficialities, who has deluded views of reality? A running and repetitious home movie is seen of a woman acting sexually aggressively with a man who wants to read. He finally pushes her away - she falls. I've no idea what this is supposed to represent. (E.g., imagine the aggression taking place on the man's part - his wife wants to read, he undresses, pushes himself upon her - she finally pushes him away, he falls. What would we be supposed to be making of that?). The movie can't be asking us to condemn the man since he was rather obviously showing a lack of interest and the woman was the aggressor - yet the protagonist says yet I want up to my father after her mom had fallen. Yes, so? Would she not have gone to her mother if the situation were reversed and the father had been the aggressor climbing upon a mother who had shown she wanted no part of sex that night? What are we supposed to make of this?We are informed by one unstable character that the reason for her persistent crimes is sexual thrill. Yet of course all criminals get sexual thrills from their defiance of society and morality. E.g., think of Leopold and Loeb and the use Hitchcock made of this in Rope. Yet somehow the protagonist (about to be named a judge!) has never heard of this - and dismisses the citations from psychological treatises read by the criminal. Again, it distances us from the protagonist - why this ignorance? There's certainly nothing related to gender about this. Ask any teenage delinquent of either gender who has stolen something from a store -- or another child -- whether it was thrilling - sure. Crimes are almost always thrilling - so? And what are we to make of the protagonist's ignorance about this?We are shown several scenes establishing a sexual relationship between two women (the protagonist and the psychiatrist). The protagonist has instigated the relationship. After staying through the night, at one point, the psychiatrist leaves the protagonist's home to go somewhere. In the last scene between the two women, the psychiatrist says she wants a different kind of relationship. In what way? We have no idea. The psychiatrist doesn't offer and the protagonist doesn't ask. The music tells us that this is somehow a bad thing - but why?We see a mother (divorced? widowed? never married? We never know - and it would have helped to know) who designs and sells wedding dresses -- she becomes disappointed that her recent relationship has soured. But we know so little of her that we don't know why the relationship has really ended - the cited argument is far too slight to end a relationship that had so progressed that the mother anticipated a proposal - or why this should be important.There are just bizarre instances of human behavior throughout the movie - i) middle aged sisters sharing baths and beds, ii) kleptomaniacs throwing in garbage cans, the object of their theft in full view of the store (but only sometimes - we don't know why she kept some articles and tossed others), iii) absolute rage at having to spend just a few nights in a rural jail despite knowledge of criminal guilt, iv) middle aged lawyers wearing short skirts who continue to sit with their legs over the chair arm -- while engaged in conversation with the partner, v) prospective appointees to the appellate bench who care more about wearing their lucky suit than anything else in life, vi) drunken revels by whole office staffs in state office building lobbies, vii) adolescent girls who slash with a razor at clothing everywhere they find it, viii) crazed lawyers sending flowers to themselves with non-romantic notes of congratulation so it can be found by their secretaries, ix) purportedly successful lawyers being able to drop all other matters in an instant to handle their sister's larceny case.The resemblance to real life is zero - but what are we to make of this? We don't know. Incidentally, I'm pretty sure that's reporter, author, editor Bob Woodward playing the Governor - why isn't he or anyone else listed in the credits in the part? Did he wants his name withdrawn? **** SPOILERS END **** The movie is just a mess. I watched it because several actresses I like (Sillas, Porizkova, Madigan, Robins, Cross) were in it. And the acting was fine (particularly a very unusual turn by Frances Fisher) but you'll find yourself resisting a fast-forward throughout the movie. When the mess ends, it's a relief. Better luck to these actresses next time.

Apparently a sort of testament to the female condition, this flick by women about women surrounds Swinton with a conglomeration of neurotic females as it plods doggedly through a maze of peculiar behavior. On the upside, this deep character study offers some excellent performances as it explores its dark and aberrant landscape. On the downside, the film is a little over-the-top and glommed up with symbolism, dream sequences, and excursions into the surreal. Lacking in story, unpleasant in subject, and artsy-fartsy in execution, the common filmgoer may find this flick unsatisfying.

(The contrary is also the case, that all the wrong people will want to watch it because they are titillated by the title. They will also react with violent antipathy, in the wake of their disappointment. The choice of title seems to have been a deliberate act of provocation.) The German title, translated, is 'Fantasies of a Woman', which is rather milder. The film is a feminist essay, and the title is intended to be ironical, the 'female perversions' referred to being those imposed upon women by a conventional male-dominated society, so that for instance being a housewife is regarded as one type of 'female perversion'. It seems somehow natural that the wildly experimental Tilda Swinton would have to be in this film indeed, how could she say no? How could such a film be made without her? She seems to be everywhere that people and films are pushing the envelope. As usual, she is breathtakingly brilliant. A surprising addition to the cast is Frances Fisher, who made such an impact as Angie, the red-headed waitress in the diner, in the intriguing television series 'Strange Luck' in 1995-6, at about this same time. Here she does some rather unnerving 'exotic dance' routines, which all goes to show something, I'm still trying to decide what, but whatever the reason for this is, she does it very well and one would think she had been a stripper or a showgirl all her life if one did not know she had instead been an actress. Tilda Swinton is electric here as a career gal who is so tense she might snap like a wire stretched too taut. She is about to be made a judge, God help us! (Many judges are crazy or weird anyway, but she would be more so than most, as the film makes all too clear.) Tilda Swinton portrays an extreme neurotic, and 'looking good' is essential to her, so she is always doing and re-doing her lipstick (an insecure woman's last refuge). She is a control freak and insanely superstitious. For instance, if she cannot wear her white suit for an interview with the Governor of California (not Arnie, a fictional one) for a judgeship, because it is 'lucky', she falls apart. Her kleptomaniac sister sees to it that she cannot wear the suit to the interview. Things are pretty tense like this throughout, and there are many fantasy elements to this film written, produced, and directed by women with women for women. I don't believe this film can really be excused by a 'women searching for their identities' justification, and if one approaches it earnestly from that angle (which may have been the earnest intention of the makers, for all I know), it is a failure which verges on parody sometimes, and has pretentious aspects. The merits of the film are different, and concern the intensity of portrayal and the mysterious depths of character revealed, especially of hidden or suppressed motivations. The lesbian aspects of the film are not central, but merely a part of the evolving self-realization of Tilda Swinton's character. I am firmly convinced that men can never understand women and women can never understand men. I first came to realize this in my teens when the novelist Pearl Buck said to me that 'men and women are completely different species and can never hope to understand one another'. That shocked me a lot, I never forgot it, and it has been repeatedly verified. I have now come to the conclusion that Nature has designed things this way. The imperative of Nature is the propagation of the species. If men and women understood each other, that would get in the way of propagation, and many fewer babies would be born. Consequently, evolutionary pressures have seen to it that this can never happen, in order to safeguard the future of the species. That is why men like myself who do not regard women as inferior beings (as many of my gender definitely do) are so intrigued by 'the mystery of women' and interested to see attempts to make films like this one where women contemplate women and try to understand themselves. It is true that there are no admirable characters on offer here, and that they are all pretty horrible people. Nevertheless, this film manages to be fascinating, although it is understandable that it would cause a lot of contradictory reactions, some of them violently opposed to it, and some admiring and appreciative. If we want films to punch us in the ribs instead of putting us to sleep, this one certainly qualifies. This is what is called 'independent film making', and long may it continue.

Poor Evelyn is a woman of career; she is beautiful, ambitious, angry, neurotic, insecure, sexually voracious, puzzled, confused, scared, morally degenerate; sexuality and career are the two coordinates of her life ,and she's consumed by her sexual desires. It's a nice, sharp study in comportment and reactions, an identity quest. The story has some kind of a psychoanalytical twist; Evie reaches to a childhood trauma. A bit naturalistic, a bit expressionist as well, the movie is a wholly feminine creation, hence somewhat viscous. There are grotesque and fancy touches as well. 'We all dream.'

Well, its a message that a movie like 'Female Perversions' tries to communicate over and over and over until it exhausts it's own theme. I'm sure that it may be hard for some women to succeed in the business world but this movie goes about it in a self-piteous and irritating way.The movie concerns a young lawyer named Eve who is frustrated every minute of every day because she has to fit a certain mold, 'play ball' so to speak to compete in order to further her own career. She is in line for a judgeship so with every fiber of femininity she is overly frustrated. So competitive is Eve that when she sees another woman in the ladies room putting on the same color lipstick she throws hers in the trash.Eve seems to use sex as a punctuation mark, as affirmation that women like sex too. She has a strange affair with an executive (Clancy Brown) who likes to perform their sexual circus tricks in his office (he seems to get off on being caught). In an elevator one day she picks up a woman and begins a brief affair with her before being told 'I'm not ready for this kind of relationship'.Eve always seems to be cracking up and escapes into sexual fantasies involving bondage at the hands of lip smacking males. She fantasizes that she is being instructed by an older woman to express herself sexually and open up.Another problem Eve has a sister, Madelyn, who lives in the country and compulsively shoplifts. Madelyn's shoplifting is giving Eve fits because she's afraid that it will cause as scandal and this is not the kind of black eye her career needs. The contrast between Eve and Madelyn are so obvious that you can see it written on the page &#x96; Eve is a career woman, Madelyn is a student, Eve dresses in power suits while Madelyn dresses casually.Tilda Swinton whom I have adored in films like 'The Ballad of Little Jo' and 'Orlando' got on my nerves in the first half hour of the film. She's suppose to be strong willed and always fighting for what she wants but all I saw was a frustrated tinderbox, a pouty irritating woman who would be better off if she would just settle down and have a little decaf.

I suspect Jung would have been amazed with this storyline, and Freud might have had a good example of what he calls the female Oedipus complex.

There is some good talent in this film, and there are even a few scenes that I found to be quite good.  However, far too often the film just drags along, and I found myself increasingly looking over at the nearest clock trying to figure out how much longer this movie would last.

Her kleptomaniac sister Maddie Stephens (Amy Madigan) is finishing her PhD in UCLA. While waiting for her interview, Eve has a simultaneous affair with John (Clancy Brown) and the psychologist Renee (Karen Sillas), and helps her mean sister to leave the jail, arrested in a shoplifting. Female Perversions is a weird movie with bizarre characters. The sad soundtrack and the photography are very beautiful and the interpretations of the cast are excellent. However, although being intriguing and provocative in some moments, the story never reaches a point and sometimes becomes boring. Further, although having naked women and many sex scenes, they are not erotic and does not excite, at least under the view of a man. I did not like this movie, but I recognize that it is a stylistic film with great performances. My vote is six.Title (Brazil) Desejos Femininos (Female Desires) "},{"Title":"This film has been terminally misjudged","Date":"11 October 2001","Score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":"  Brilliant, sensual. It's a psychological jigsaw puzzle to challenge even the most erudite of viewers into figuring it out. The 5.5 was highly undeserved, particularly due to the presence of the divine miss Tilda Swinton, intended to play an icy and unfeeling character. Eve is very real and in our fear of what could happen if we let go of our heart is stronger by far as a character than those in Cruel Intentions which was recommended to those who enjoyed Female Perversions.

Most films that require a stong group performance from an ensemble in order to work don't have one central part that basically has the film revolve around it so it doesn't collapse under it's own weight.  Here, the supporting players have to do a good job or the movie rings false.  But if Tilda Swinton doesn't do the best performance of her career, it collapses into an unwatchable, tedious mess.  There are four or five supporting roles that, if they don't work (even one of them) then the film is a bust.  If Tilda Swinton phones it in, the film collapses.  Most movies don't have this large a dichotomy-they are either ensemble casts (like The Big Chill or Glengarry Glen Ross) or they have a dominant performance and perhaps one or two roles that need to work and everything else isn't crucial (like, say, Philadelphia or The Verdict).  For the most part, the film works, with one or two false steps.  Recommended for the open-minded and venturesome.

It's so bad that even on TV, it's boring. How did people like Tilda Swinton, Karen Sillas and Amy Madigan become involved in this piece of unredeemable garbage is beyond me. La Swinton likes performing in bad, pretentious movies, she is really quite insufferable. The other two, beats me. It's humorless and pointless and about some mysterious kind of female suffering that is quite unbearable to watch and a figment of a seriously misguided feminist's imagination. Just watching it gave me PMS. Listed as executive producer is Zalman King, king of soft porn laughable films. Yuck.

It is really bad, first of all they should sue the microphone guy for letting the micro appear so much into the picture of the movie (I never saw that happening before in any of the movies I have seen.....), and the director for such a lack of diligence and professionalism. If that kind of thing is let to happen, what can be said of the efforts input in other parts of the movie???Streitfeld seems to try to improvise herself as Lynch in some scenes (in the house with the 3 women and the girl) but it is not a success at all...Yes, if you see that movie you will see Swinton naked. But I am not sure that it is really an attraction... the former model playing the new attorney in the movie would have been a much safer bet.

No all of it. I didn't catch the beginning. But, I am still shaking. Low budget, feminism, exacerbated sexuality, irony. Remember the scene were the governor says something about his children? I think that is a clue there. Maybe the old values of family are praised here, in a glimpse. Maybe the sincerity is not neglected. This film is not a feminist lecture. But it have all the points of view inside. It is like a chamber with mirrors where an object reflects different in every of them.I give this film a well deserved 9 of 10. Very good.

Step into the world of these film makers and relax. It is strange and beautiful, thoughtful and provocative. Unfortunately, the film is no longer available on DVD....I hope it will soon be re-released. It is worth it. Give the film a chance. It deserves it.

It attempts to merge the cool abstract perspective of Hal  Hartley with the visceral exploration of personal damage of Jane Campion. These two  seem contradictory and indeed are not successfully combined here.But it has some very lovely and lasting images, enough so that the experience is  definitely worthwhile. The project actually seems to have been conceived around a few of  these set pieces, then loosely tied together with some narrative bits.When people take chances like this, they deserve our attention. They deserve as much  risk in the watching as they took in the making. Not everyone believes in risky watching  - but if you do, you can trust Tilda. The idea here is that women are victims of the roles thrust upon them. Tilda is more  intelligent as an actress than is Streitfeld as a filmmaker so she is thrust into much the  same situation. Watch how she uses the latter to illuminate the former. This is not the  intended exploration of how woman misfit into society, instead concerns how they misfit  into the film imagination.That's where the Hartley technique comes in. His films are about films, with lots of self  comment and layer shifting. Not all of this worked for me, but enough did.The key failure is in balancing archetype and stereotype in presenting character icons.  Here, we haveEve, who is unfairly reduced to a sexually confused parental rejectMaddie, her sister who gets a doctorate in her own pathology, emotional theftAnnunciata, a selfconstructed stripper/seducerRenee, a reluctant bisexual psychiatristLangley, a character that only women will appreciate, the womaneating weaselEmma, terminally hungry for loveEd, hypnotized by her commanding wombAn Earth MotherAn absent motherIf this sounds like Greenaway's `8 1/2 Women` taxonomy, it is. You might go there for a  better purely abstract examination of this same notion of roles as prisons/perversions.If you merely need the visceral, `Ten Tiny Love Stories,' may be your station. The notion  of roles and fantasy layering is also in `Heavenly Creatures,' and better.Here's a delicious irony. Notice that the first three women on the list are redheads? I'm  convinced that one of the strongest automatic perceptions, one of the deepest,  hardwired presumptions about the female image is associated with red hair. Would have  been good to know if Streitfeld was an unwitting victim of this.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.  "}]
