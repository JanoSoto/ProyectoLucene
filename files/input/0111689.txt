However, you must be in the proper mood to enjoy a movie such as this. This movie centers around 2 lonely characters, man and woman, on a 'first' date at the woman's apartment. This movie is not too funny nor is it fast paced. The movie simply tries to flesh out each person's character for 90 minutes. This movie also led to some candid discussion between my fianc√© and I, especially about the man's 'troubles' at the end of the film. We also discussed if there would be a 'second' date between them. The movie is steeped in realism and is shot very well. Worth a look if you're in the proper mood for a slow but interesting, character development story. 6 out of 10.

Jackie really likes Michael very much and finds in him the reason for her to get up every morning and go to work. Single like Michael she as well as him want to have a relationship to put a wedge between the loneliness that they both feel but living as they do in a major modern metropolis in a way forces them not to be themselves. Michael is far more deluded then Jackie, who's more down to earth and honest about herself, in him thinking that he's a big time social activist who's writing a book, that he tells Jackie took him fifteen years to write, about the law profession and how it hurts those that it deals with. Michael in fact is really a very insecure young man afraid of facing life and thus losing himself in a fantasy world that he created for himself inside his living room watching TV shows mostly on the Discovery Channel. It comes as a great shock to Michael's ego when Jackie shows him a children book that she wrote that was published unlike his imaginary work on social injustice. Throughout the entire film Jackie does what she can to loosen Michael up, with almost an entire bottle of wine, and in the end he does seem to come out of his shell and really starts to get it on with Jackie. Still his insecurity keeps him from really being responsive to her feelings about him and it's that reaction that leaves Jackie in tears as she feels she made a fool of herself trying to get Michael to fall in love with her like she's with him. Michael is finally brought down to earth when he realizes how he hurt Jackie with his overwhelming sense of self-importance. Michael's clumsy attempt to make things right after he tried to leave her just as Jackie thought he would stay over night left her with a sense of outraged. It's then that she tells Michael just what she thought of him, this after how she felt all this time about him, and how he was the only person to make her happy in the office that they both worked at. That revelation by Jackie hit Michael so hard that for once he opens up to her and is honest about himself, not at first realizing her feelings that she had for him, and tries to make amends for what he, unconsciously, put her through that evening. Heart-felt and moving film about how people have trouble connecting with each other and how two people who worked and were friends for years at the job together are like fish out of water and strangers when they meet and try to start up a serious relationship out of the workplace.

He is defensive about why he works at said firm, and Sillas finds him interesting, saying he must have some grand plan to get revenge on the attorneys at the firm.The only somewhat nebulous plot point is where Sillas reads the children's book she has written, which turns out to be quite violent.

What the movie is, is a very finely crafted film much like My Dinner With Andre but much more somber. The layers of these characters peel off as they become more and more comfortable with each other and it creates for an almost voyeristic feel that lends the movie an immediate impact credibility.  This movie is reflective of how many, many people interact and present themselves as something they are not and how fragile people can really be.   We see and work with people every day who could be lost souls, lonely hearts, broken egos etc.....and this movie simply reminds us that not everyone is what they seem and that the world is full of lost, lonely people.

One of the toughest tricks to pull off is making film people talk like real people; director/writer Noonan does it o.k. This film generates a prickling, enjoyable sense of unease in the viewer, which gives way to discomfort and then alarm; and then on to awkwardness and the hope for reconciliation.The only other Noonan film I've seen, apart from his cameo in the enjoyable hokum `Heat,' is `The Wife,' which I feel is less successful. One of the small cast of that film is Wallace Shawm, star of  `My Dinner with Andre,' which has been mentioned her by another reviewer. As he says, `What Happened Was' is on similar territory to `Andre,' but it's much more somber and doesn't give that `redeeming' feeling at its end. Demanding and rewarding.

She delivers a fine performance, and Mr. Noonan's response is perhaps that of the audience.  I shifted in my seat, peering into a soul perverted by anxiety and solitude.

Neither of its only two characters was particularly likable and yet the film permeated and enveloped in such a way as to make it imperative to care about and root for them. Both individually and as a couple.But the rooting was not without an ambivalence. The film unfolds and draws the viewer in but it never throws out a liferope with a hint of buoyancy to cling to. The man and the woman are intriguing but each of them has very evident psychological obstacles in their makeup. Maybe insurmountable obstacles.You want things to work out for them but you have to ask yourself to what end. Their lives are each severely wanting and problematical to put it mildly but there is no indication that joining forces would in any way ease the situation.Noonan never makes it easy for the viewer. It's kind of daring and exciting to realize at the end what choices he made as a writer and as a director. The characters are without any easily accessible wit or accessible charm and yet their dialogue is fascinating.Their exchanges are agonizingly awkward and yet completely engrossing. Engrossing in a very uncomforable sort of way. The discomfort was probably because it rang so raw and without any tarting up.I longed for more theatricality in the delivery of the lines. That would have provided an emotional distance and made it easier to take the film. But I have to admire Noonan for not choosing that route as a director.By going completely naturalistic, there was no barrier, nothing to shield you from the film's impact.I wish Noonan had chosen to end the film differently, though. I wish there had been more of a glimmer of hope.Although it's beyond presumptuous to discuss changes to the script, I wish that Noonan had ended the film with the Jackie character giving a different response to the Michael character's invitation to go out with him Friday night. Rather than responding that he should ask her again when they saw each other at work (accompanied by an expression on her face indicating that she had already lost complete interest in him), I wish she had instead said that she would be glad to have dinner with him if it could be a celebratory dinner. It would be conditional. That when he had finished making the preliminary arrangements to complete the credits for his law degree, she would be glad to join him for dinner. And that would be only a small indication of the kind of congratulatory blowout she would plan for him after he had gone on to pass the bar exam. And if Michael had also in turn given some reciprocal show of support to Jackie. She had no writing talent but judging from her apartment, she had creativity and a good eye. There was promise there. Promise to be encouraged.I guess I just wanted to believe that there was some small glimmer of hope that they could help rescue each other. But instead the ending was relentlessly and piercingly grim. Well worth seeing, though! The acting was brilliant, the set design, the cinematography, the music, all exceptional. And the last shot of all the buildings and all the apartment windows was very powerful carrying as it did the message that behind each window was more drama.

The characters were so like real people, talking about what regular office people talk about. I was about to leave it to go on the computer when Karen Sillas's character, Jackie, read her story to Michael (Tom Noonan). It was at this point that the movie went from being a realistic, low-key indie to something unique, approaching art. Jackie's story reveals how different she really is from the smooth, flirtatious secretary she appeared to be. Part of the appeal of this film is the way Noonan turns our expectations upside down, revealing the one who seems most together to be the one most hopelessly wounded.Using sound and lighting, Noonan creates an atmosphere of near-madness. He is brilliant at evoking the painful and disturbing feelings of his female character. Through lighting he transforms Jackie from superficial secretary to deeply disturbed and desperate woman.The final scenes, in which the characters have revealed some hint of their true selves, instead of the cardboard characters they display in the office, are moving. The movie has something important to say, and says it in an original and creative way. It's grossly unfair to highlight the asinine comment of the first user.

She has been attracted to him and hopes the dinner will bring them closer. It does, but in ways she did not intend. He is an older law school dropout who has charmed her at work with his witty sarcasm directed at the lawyers. Both are lonely losers, and a Hollywood film would have them find love and happiness in each other's arms.

The movie is based on a stage play that Noonan wrote and he turns it into a very cinematic experience with lots of mobile camera-work early on and some unsettling cutaway shots later on as lead actress Karen Sillas reads a ghoulish children's tale. The juice of the film comes from the constant sense of uneasiness in the air and a general sense of something sinister afoot. Both characters have moments in which they seem borderline psychotic and it gradually becomes clear that they are not as good friends as they thought they were when together in the workplace -- which may be the very point of the film. Promising as all this might sound, the film never quite capitalises on its implications of sinister things out there. Noonan's constant glances out the window (and the voyeuristic shots that look back at him) create a particularly ominous mood in the story-reading scene, but this mood shatters once the story is over. Other offbeat touches, like a fluorescent light flickering as Noonan enters the apartment, also add little to the tale. If not a wholly satisfying film, 'What Happened Was...' is at least daringly different and it is incredibly encapsulating for a film that essentially just consists of two people talking. Both characters are extremely easy to relate to, and some of the more subtle directing touches (silences; repeated dialogue) go a long way to rendering both of them as very human despite their individual quirks.

The relationship between the couple on their so called date is so awkward that even the audience is lost in a trance. I LIKE THAT FEELING. It is neither a good, nor bad feeling, but it is LIVING and a psychological game we as humans play with one another that always has the same rules/outcome. Always; You hide. You hide who you are and what you do to PROTECT this person from figuring out who you really are. Which is a boring, unmotivated vessel. Their is a scene towards the end when, after Tom Noonan pours his heart out and says how pathetic he is, our main actress, Karen Sillas' character, mentionsIt's funny, you know? You finally GROW UP. You know, you finally figure out who the hell you are.

I watched this on charlie kaufman's recommendation (uh, from an interview), so take it from him. 10/10  "},{"Title":"Tom Noonan is CREEPY but interestinng..","Date":"12 January 2004","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  This man is so odd.  He was very good in this movie. I was surprised how well he did on this strange first date.  For the most part, the entire movie was shot in some NYC apartment and it was just about these TWO characters talking to eachother in a very awkward and uncomfortable manner. The female lead in this movie was HOT and I could not believe she was attracted to the bizarre looking Tom Noonan!!!  Great movie though....for me.

My fiancee, who was watching with me, fell asleep at about that point. I couldn't imagine that the painful and uncomfortable interactions of the two main characters on their first date could turn into anything vaguely interesting.But I was very glad that I stayed with it. Both main characters aren't what they first seem to be. It's rare to have one's perception of characters change so dramatically--yet credibly--in the course of single movie. I was intrigued, entranced, beguiled.Definitely a worthwhile rental for the thinking movie buff.

They're completely myopic. Go somewhere else and spew your nonsense! This movie is wonderful..its only flaw is that it was too short. I could have watched these characters navigate through this first date another hour. The only scene that didn't draw me in as much, though at least served as some sort of bridge to reveal that Jackie actually accomplished something that her date hasn't (yet? perhaps, but unlikely), is the one in which she read her story. I didn't like the story at all, though it may have tried to reveal that her character had some painful memories in her life to work out...we don't really know. Nonetheless, I loved this film. The awkwardness in the beginning of their conversation, after he first arrives at her apartment, especially on her part, and the revelation at the end of his character were both very touching. Moreover, I loved the ending. ***Spoiler to come*** Once he unleashes his burden by revealing what he does reveal about himself to her, he is ready to continue their conversation, more or less, and ask her out on a second date. I loved her reaction, in turn. They're both hurt, lonely people, and want to tread cautiously with this relationship, each at different points in the film.I very highly recommend this film if you're interested in delving into a character's psyche. If you need a loud soundtrack, goo-goo eyes, and a really happy ending, this is not the film for you. It takes place in one apartment the entire length of the film (and I love the apartment, its blue hues and its simplicity of design, even though it is really small...you just imagine her small lonely life, but sort of marvel that she gets up every morning and goes to work every day, and keeps afloat).The music used in the opening and at the end is great as well, which Tom Noonan composed. I wish I could find the soundtrack. It's a great little film that I've been watching very frequently lately. I only wish it were longer. Or, maybe Noonan should do what Ethan Hawke did with Before Sunrise, and make a sequel, ten years later. Do these characters still work at the same firm? Are they dating? Do they have separate lives altogether but happen to run into each other one day? Does he salvage himself to any degree? I'd love to see each of their stories and how they may or may not intertwine again.

There was one time I wanted to escape my present company so desperately that I pretended my water broke (amazing they bought it, as I was only five months pregnant).  But nothing compares to the painful evening the couple in this film endure.  It's almost voyeuristic as we observe, in real time, the lulls in conversation, forced laughter, and embarrassing confessions of these two losers.Two things that are praiseworthy (1) Tom Noonan, who plays Michael (and is also the writer/director) is completely believable in his role, and (2) the movie's pretty short.One more thing - I've seen, read, and dreamt a whole lotta of scary things in my life, but apparently I'm a nightmare lightweight compared to the stuff going on in Noonan's mind.  The segment where Jackie reads her children's story aloud is, quite possibly, the most disturbing sequence on film.

It seemed to drag a little at the start, but once I knew something about the characters, it really took off.  The best part of the film for me was when Jackie was reading her story, for it could be the basis for a great, completely unrelated movie.  As for the main plot, my level of interest did vary from scene to scene, but I thought that it was all worth it in the end.  I am  glad that I took the time to watch it.

There are shades of MY DINNER WITH ANDRE here except it's not two men getting together for dinner and conversation it's a man and women on a date.  The whole film takes place in the women's apartment and simply follows their date and course of conversation.     It scores a bullseye when it comes to modern day dating and all the elements that come with it.  Anyone who has done a lot of dating or is heavily into the dating scene will most assuredly relate.  These are indeed two very real people.  Sillas is a women typical to the dating scene.  She is rather plain looking with a boring job and rather dreary  overall existence.  She looks for a relationship as a way to escape the blandness.  Her nervous laughter and gestures are completely on target.  Noonan, as her male counterpart, is indeed the culmination of a typical male lost in the dating jungle.  He is balding and gawky. He is smart and amiable, but still limited in his interactions.     There ninety minute dialogue is both painful and funny.  It is clear that these two people, like in a lot of first dates, are in two very different worlds.  They never really talk or connect.  They try to force something to work that really can't simply to avoid their own loneliness.     The concept is terrific, but the overall visual style is not.  The color is too washed out and the effect is too grayish and bland.  The pacing is all right, but there is a odd segment involving the reading of a childrens story that the Sillas character had written.  The story is very ghoulish in nature and seems like something that would not have been written by that type of character.  The reading of the story goes on too long and there are some subtly strange supernatural elements that happen during it that doesn't make any sense and certainly doesn't fit with the rest of the picture.     Overall though it is a nice try.  It can be both entertaining and amusing in it's observations.  Yet it's approach is bit too honest and oppressive.  It may hit too close too home for some reminding them too much of their own bad dates and their own situation.  Viewing this could ultimately become just one big depressing experience.

This is truly a test in patience.  I would think that if you're good at 10,000 piece puzzles of white husky puppies in the snow, you may endure this movie.  It's now been on for 20 minutes and the only reason I could possibly watch any more is to see if this guy turns out to be a serial killer and murders this pathetic woman.  I had to see if these reviews here could please spoil the ending so I could turn this off or at least wait till the 'good' part.  But from reading others, it's this way all through the 'film' (loosely termed)  I struggle to wonder who actually paid to see or better yet make this film.  again...OH MY GOD  Leave it to WE (women's entertainment) to air this on TV.  OK I'm not just harping, but in this half an hour the dialogue has consistently been slow, awkward, meaningless, and every sentence ends with, are you joking? oh you ARE joking (awkward laugh) you're SO FUNNY! "},{"Title":"Wretched","Date":"23 February 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  I like dialogue and the discovery of a character's idiosyncracies as much as the next person, but this movie had neither.  If we are going to watch a movie about a first date, questions like Why is Jackie attracted to him should be resolved.  I hope I never have a first date like this, one where my date and I inadvertently insult each other every few minutes, where I serve dinner out of tupperware, and where despite the lack of any sexual tension I let my breasts fall out of the top of my dress.My main problem with this film is the lack of closeness we felt due to the direction of Tom Noonan.  We are supposed to be getting to know these people the way they are getting to know each other.  It's an intimate situation, especially with all the wine flowing.   But we are made to feel like visitors by watching their interactions through a series of master shots.Perhaps Tom Noonan wanted the audience to feel the voyeurism that Jackie and her neighbors all found solace in, but it really took away from any attachment we could have established for either of these people.

A non-event.  At first glance, Jackie (portrayed by Karen Sillas) seems worth the investment in time to wait for her character to develop. Unfortunately, Michael (Tom Noonan) is too depressing and neurotic to allow Jackie to blossom.  This movie gives being single and dating a bad name.  Had sex been introduced, it would have been anti-climactic.  I recommend watching an infomercial about a bread-making machine before watching this.
