[{"Title":"It isn't Citizen Kane, but it never said it was.","Date":"29 September 2003","Score":"7 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"    ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** This film made me laugh, simple as that, so it would qualify as a success as a comedy. The laughs are low-brow and you don't have to be an intellectual to understand or `get' the jokes when they come around.  This movie seems to have a lot of words like `tired' attached to it, and many people question whether the Farrelly brothers started losing the comedy muscle with this movie and while I would agree with these statements, I think they are still wide of the mark in most cases.This movie is meant to revolt you, make you cringe and leave you disbelieving that people would do some of the things that will happen and anyone that has a problem with this, I retort by saying `well, duh!'  The main review that was on this page for this movie ripped it to pieces, which would have been fine except the person didn't even get the details of the movie right. I'm all for denouncing a movie, but please get the facts right if you're going to do it.The story is simple. Boy meets girl, fall in love, get engaged and then find out their actually long lost brother and sister. Flash forward 16 months and we find girl engaged to wealthy small town man and boy with his newly found parents actually finding out that it was a mistake and they aren't related at all. Mother wants daughter to marry rich boy and neglects to tell daughter that boy is not her brother. Boy goes to said small town to win her back. Mother does everything in her power to stop boy, including making out he is a sexual predator. Well, it's actually pretty simple when you watch it. Plus there is some great subplot characters to go into the mix to keep the story moving.There seems to be a very definite elitism when it comes to comedies such as this. Hey, I like a great dark comedy with many layers as much as the next person, but sometimes, I really like to just watch something that doesn't tax the brain. This falls into the latter category and has a sweet, twisted love story at its centre to boot. The acting from the leads isn't earth shattering but the support cast is a riot.Don't look to hard and you will be entertained. 2Â¾ outta 5  "},{"Title":"Expect the unexpected along with the usual raunchiness","Date":"13 June 2003","Score":"8 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  This movie is typical of the raunchy comedy you can expect from Bobby & Peter Farrelly. Perhaps I haven't seen enough of their movies to make an adequate judgment, but I didn't notice anything missing vibes from it. There are a few surprises in it however, that could make you ask questions beginning with Who Knew? Who knew Orlando Jones could be cool? If you saw his 7-Up commercials you wouldn't think he was. For the record, his character was not Jimi Hendrix, or his ghost, or some nut who thought he was Hendrix. Who knew Sally Field could pass herself off as a villainess, and a comical one at that? Fans who like her best during her Gidget/Flying Nun years will be just as surprised as those who praise her for Sybil, Norma Rae, Places in the Heart, and similar TV-Movies & tear-jerkers.Who knew the Farrelly Brothers would make a woman suffer so much heartbreak? In There's Something About Mary, we have Ben Stiller sobbing it up over the presumed loss of his object of desire. Here we have Heather Graham doing the same thing over a man she loves, but still believes is her brother.Who knew an otherwise sugar sweet poem would be used as a weapon on any pets spending their final moments on earth? There's the scene where Chris Kline recites the poem he uses for abandoned animals he's about to exterminate for Heather Graham. I don't care how beautiful she thought it was, if I were any of those animals I'd be as scared of that poem as I would of the idea of being killed on the expiration date.Anyway, this movie has a lot of sleaze, a lot of heart, and a lot of surprises. If you're not the uptight prim and proper-type, check it out.

I hate when previews mislead you like that.  Nine times out of ten, when you hear the announcer in a trailer say, from horror master Wes Craven or something of that sort, it means the well-known director is a producer or executive producer in the project, like in this case.  But it still has that Farrelly vibe, since J.B. Rogers worked as the A.D. in their previous works.  The movie gets off to a slow start.  The gags start off pretty lame.  And most of the funny parts shown were given away in the previews.  We're handed a lot of quirks, but the comedy doesn't quite gel.  We have Richard Jenkins as a wheelchair-bound father, who uses excessive profanity through a voice-box.  So far, we're pushing the envelope, but the laughs haven't entirely arrived.  I have to admit, though, the nipple-piercing scene was very funny.  Luckily, that scene wasn't completely given away in the trailers, because quite frankly--it couldn't be shown on network television.  The film speeds up the comedy with the arrival of Orlando Jones as a pilot with artificial legs and a Jimmi Hendrix hairdo.  For some reason, the Farrellys have an obsession with handicapped characters.  Jones is very funny, and brings in the film's biggest laughs.  I also think we wander into one-joke territory one time too many.  OK, the guy banged his sister.  It was funny at first.  How many times do we have to hear it repeated in the next gag...and the gag after that...and the gag after that?  But the gags improve as we go along, and I got more and more laughs.  By the last thirty minutes, I was laughing myself silly!  So I wouldn't say this comedy is anywhere near as bad as most people said it was.  Say It Isn't So isn't the best comedy of the year, but it often delivers.  And it's one of the few comedies that gets funnier as it goes along, rather than starting off with a bang and dragging on as it progresses.

The Farrellys aspire to this capability -- and one can see how they are getting better with each film.Humor is a seemingly necessary component which can form the primary lever -- the Cohens for instance create a physics based on whimsical self-reference. The Farrellys shoot lower, which means they have the potential of a larger audience, but they depend more heavily on the comedic skills of the performers.It worked with `Mary,' and failed with `Irene' and here because the actors couldn't find the groove and that's because the groove wasn't deep enough.

I liked the first part but it was very difficult for me to watch the last of it. The ending I think was nice but I was not paying a lot of attention then.This movie is definitely an example of something that would be more with less; less outrageous would make it much more enjoyable, especially since Heather Graham is so cute.

That is getting old, and the Farrelly brothers are beginning to lose their credibility. Just look at Outside Providence, and Me, Myself, & Irene. They are losing their outrageously funny sense of humor. Here, there is plenty of offensive material, crude humor, gross out sight gags and disgusting subjects, but the real impulse and wit are gone. This movie basically has one joke repeated continuously.and the original joke isn't even all that funny.Say It Isn't So! ponders upon the question of what if you fell in love with a beautiful woman only to find out, after wild sex and popping the big question, that she is actually your long lost sister? The film's main character, Gilly Noble, played by Chris Klein from Here on Earth, which, in a sense, was even worse than this picture, must deal with this vary situation, and things get even more complicated when (spoiler) he finds out his love is not really his sibling after all!I am getting ahead of myself here. Lets start at the very beginning, when Gilly, an underpaid dog catcher, meets an attractive but untalented hair stylist named Jo Wingfield (Heather Graham from Bowfinger). He has no parents, but is frantically searching for them as he has hired a spy to search for his birth mother. She has parents, but her father (Richard Jenkins) is terminally ill and communicates through an electronic voice amplifier and despises almost everyone he comes in which he contacts, and her mother (Sally Field) is a bitter, scheming, money-hungry con woman who hides from Gilly that Jo is not his sister, so that the heroine can marry a popular millionaire.The film's individual scenes feel awkward and uneasy, as if the filmmakers are unsure of what they are doing and if they are doing it right. It does not appear that they knew what they were doing, and even if they did, they do almost everything wrong, anyway. Dialogue is unconfident, cringe-inducing, and often down right stupid-making for a movie that is both boring and pointless. The actual sense of humor consists of typical Farrelly gestures physical injury, sexually frank undertones and remarks, victimized animals, and political incorrectness. But for the most part this movie confuses public humiliation with embarrassment and that becomes painfully irritating. After a while, the sexual content losses what little shock value it had, and become just a constant array of sexual references and foul comments.I would really like to know if the filmmakers instructed Heather Graham and Chris Klein to exploit their worst possible acting ability because they do not even have the acting quality of middle school kids in a Friday night, two for a dollar, 30-minute presentation. They are both capable of a whole lot more, and they seem to confuse the idea that in order to be successful in a comedy, you need not to act silly, but act seriously in order for a joke to be played upon them. As a result of the performance miscalculations, the film's many side characters upstage the two main characters, thus we never really care about either one of them.The film's director is J.B. Rogers, who used to go by James B. Rogers, until now, that is. Maybe he wanted to go by a different name so that this film will not haunt his reputation for long. The writers are novices Peter Gaulke and Gerry Swallow. Gaulke has some experience with Saturday Night Live (the combined letters SNL are almost always a death sentence to a movie, Say It Isn't So!, is no exception), and Swallow has nothing to his writing credits until now. I have good news for both of these screenwriters their careers can only go uphill from here!

That's all I can say really. Say It Isn't So is a byproduct of all the gross-out, silly, ridiculous romcoms that were popular in the early 2000s and this one doesn't differentiate itself from the pack at all. It sometimes pushes the boundaries of, Wait, is this offensive or funny? But even then, that doesn't even matter if the end product is actually funny, which it isn't. There are a couple chuckle-worthy moments, but they are so few and far between it's not even worth subjecting yourself to the entire 80 or so minutes of idiocy.Acting wise, it's hard to complain. Heather Graham is great as the affable, bubbly girl and Chris Klein is passable as the cheesy, romantic guy. I'd say he's bad in the movie but the dialogue itself is so dumb I can't even fault him for it. The real standout is Richard Jenkins as Graham's father who is paralyzed and speaks in a robot voice most of the time. His character is where most of the laughs come from. Everyone else is serviceable, given the material at least.There are hints of incest, bodily humor, gross-out gags, and the like. Some of it works, most of it doesn't. Overall though, Say It Isn't So is a swing and a miss.

Just when I thought I had seen the worst 2001 had to offer (Including, among others, Freddy Got Fingered, 3000 Miles to Graceland and Lara Croft Tomb Raider), this movie pops up on late night cable and makes me wish it hadn't.  Let's be blunt; this movie stinks.If there is a God in the universe in which this movie takes place, then Gilbert Noble (Chris Klein) is his favorite person to torture when He's having a bad day.  Gillie is an orphan, a lonely guy working at his local animal shelter.  He finds the love of his life Jo Wingfield (Heather Graham), but there's a problem.  It seems that Jo's parents are also Gillie's.  Jo leaves and finds another guy, when Gillie discovers that he isn't really her brother, so he heads after her.The incest joke could, I suppose, have been good for one laugh in a movie.  But as the WHOLE movie, it is a rather thin, and the script (by Peter Gaulke and Gerry Swallow) feels like a Farrelly Brothers ripoff, not the real thing.  Odd since Peter and Bobby Farrelly are actually two of the producers on this movie.As told in the film, everyone in the entire world except Gillie, Jo and one or two other characters, is cold, heartless, and greedy.  Gillie is held to a standard of behavior whereby he would need precognitive telepathic abilities to act properly.  Even though he didn't know he was sleeping with his sister, he is ridiculed mercilessly, scorned, and abandoned by his parents.  You feel bad for Gillie, especially since Jo is an awful mate, except that she looks like Heather Graham.  They fall for each other as she gives him an awful haircut and cuts off his ear.  This, Van Gogh fans, is played for laughs.  The movie is a series of low notes.  I thought it couldn't get worse when Sally Field wiped her armpits with a sandwich to give to her stroke-inflicted husband, but that was before the movie shifted locations to Beaver, Oregon, hitting the audience over the head with Beaver joke after Beaver joke.  They finally flog that bit to death, but just when you see the light at the end of the tunnel, Gillie sticks his arm in a bull's behind up to his shoulder, then gets dragged through town, then loses something in there he has to retrieve.  Chris Klein, so good in Election and American Pie, followed those two fine movies with Say It Isn't So and Rollerball.  Say this for him, it's only up from here.The only reason to watch this movie is the soundtrack, featuring songs by Teenage Fanclub, Third Eye Blind, and others.  I'd like to say skip the movie and get the soundtrack, but apparently the movie did so poorly they never even bothered to release it on CD.  I know what you're thinking, No soundtrack?

So, if you are tired of going to see movies at the theater that have turned out not to be funny (EX. MR. DEEDS, MEN IN BLACK II) and you want something funny, go pick up SAY IT ISN'T SO! and laugh until you cry. While the film isn't really dramatic in the moments it tries to be, it is more of just a plain comedy that it is a romantic comedy. But, either way you think of it, it is still really funny.....SAY IT ISN'T SO! gets 4/5.

Don't be turned off by the overall low rating.  This movie is very lighthearted fun and that's all it tries to be.  It's biggest problem is some poor story line editing. The story line could have been streamlined to avoid some bumps.  Chris Klein is is Chris Klein ... meaning he is the same character that he's always been in movies such as Election and American Pie.  Personally I like this character. Heather Graham's acting was weak.  I don't know if it was her script or just her approach to the character.  She was unimpressive.  I just don't think she was cut out for this role.  However Sally Field was fantastic as usual.  Her skills greatly added to this movie and really made up for Ms. Grahams weak performance.  Orlando Jones was great as was Richard Jenkins.The bottom line here is that this movie is funny and worth watching if that's what you are seeking. Its two main flaws are the editing and Heather Grahams performance or casting.  If they could have improved those two things I think this movie could have been as high as an 8.

Fresher, at least, than Something about Mary, which is not that great of a film to begin with.

Okay, its no masterpiece, it's not the smartest thing I've ever seen and the plot isn't exactly new, but Say It Isn't So remains harmless fun with a lot of original jokes and gags stuck somewhere in there. Of course, some of them are predictable. When Gilly (Chris Klein) tries to tell Jo he loves her and he is not her brother, he does by helicopter, but while the flying machine is getting reading, the word `NOT' is ripped off, and behind the helicopter it reads `JO, I'M YOUR BROTHER MARRY ME!' and Gilly is screaming `I love you out the chopper's window. Predictable, but still funny. The film hits the right comic marks right from the start, with a very funny hairdressing scene, Richard Jenkins with a voice machine and bees covered over his head. Hilarious stuff, and all very enjoyable. Chris Klein is very funny as the over-sensitive Gilly and Heather Graham isn't as annoying as I thought she would be. However, Richard Jenkins is the star of the film &#150; he livens up all the funny scenes and acts great with a voice machine. Critics will hate for me this review, but I don't care, I'm not denying my enjoyment of this film. After all, everyone has to have their guilty pleasure for the year, right?

Their were a few funny bits and an okay cast.The film is basically about Gilly Noble (Chris Klien.) who ends up falling for the new hairdresser in town Jo Wingfield. (Heather Graham.) Jo is not actually a good hairdresser but the guys go to  her anywhere because they think she's gorgeous. That's the reason Gilly ended up going there in the first place too. Anyway, whilst he's getting his haircut Jo accidentally chops half his ear off and he ends up going going to the hospital, whilst he's there, Jo offers to take him out for dinner as an apology and they end up getting together and engaged.As a child Gilly was adopted and over the last few years he's had a private investigator trying to find his real parents. Sadly, nothing came off it. Six months, into his relationship with Jo though he ends up finding out who is real parents are. They  end up turning to be Valdenine (Sally Field.) and Walter (Richard Jenkins.) Whingfield Who just happen to be Jo's parents.  When she founds out, embarrassed Jo ,then runs away to live with Jack Mitchelson (Eddie Cibrian.) whom she was dating in the first place but left to be with Gilly. Gilly is upset as he still loves Jo but he can't do anything about it. He ends up staying with his 'parents' and in the same town. (Where they all make fun of him because he 'slept' with his sister.) Until, one day there's a knock on the door and in comes Leon Pitofsky (Jack Plotnick.) who actually turns out to be Valdine and Walters real child, so that means Gilly and Jo are not brother and sister. This leaves Gilly being thrown out of the house and being called a drifter by Val and Walt.He then decides to go off and find Jo to tell her he loves her but Val doesn't want Jo to know that Gilly is not her brother so she sets up all these kind of traps to stop her from finding out. In the mean time, whilst Gilly is on his way to find Jo he meets Dig McCaffey (Orlando Jones.) who is a hitchhiker. Gilly and him end up being friends and Dig helps Gilly to find Jo and tell her the truth. Before that happens Gilly ends up being in a mental home . (Where he ends up looking like Hannibal Lector for a while.) He get's called a sex-offender. Oh, and and many other things too.Well, once Gilly ends up finding Jo and he explains everything, she doesn't believe him until the end when YES they obviously do get together and married. Oh, and Gilly's real mum turns out to be 'Suzanne Somers' Anyway, the Farrelly brothers have done a good job here.

He's a handsome guy who grew up as an orphan and is not a womanizing type. He's waiting for the right one to come. And, in deed, she does. The ONE is the roller skater porn star of Boogie Nights, Heather Graham, who this time is a clumsy hair stylist with razor-sharp scissors, a huge threat to those willing to keep their ears in one piece... Gilly, of course, falls into her trap immediately but gets out of it victorious, winning the heart of his dreamgirl. A minor glitch in their blooming relationship is the fact that they are brother and sister. This, however, comes to light only after spending about six months together, in and out of bed. Quite a bummer, huh?Rollergirl returns to her ex-boyfriend, the very charming, very rich, very powerful and highly deceitful Jack, the kingpin of Beaver (a rather telltale name). Gilly stays home with his 'new' parents, a mother (Sally Field) and her crippled, saliva dribbling  beloved husband (Richard Jenkins). Of course, a sister humper in a small town is the target of harsh criticism, to say the least. Quite practical jokes here, in deed. Gilly then finds out he may not be the brother of Jo, and off he goes to the faraway Beaver to find the love of his life and tell her about the mistake. The dear mother sees to it that he's not welcome in town and the time for hilarious laughs comes.The Farrelly brothers are not too gentle on our taste this time, either. The jokes vary from being disgusting to being rather cruel, but there are scenes and lines which make the audience roll. Just a few examples to drive away or attract fans or haters of the Farrelly bros. Armpit sandwich, one arm up and stuck in cow's ass, hillbilly with poor eyesight and big metal bat, saliva dribbling, cat licking male genitals, and numerous puns, such as vaginatarian...All in all, a great fun for those wanting a bit less than intelligent humor, and those who liked Me, Myself and Irene.

Nevertheless, there are certain guidelines.   For instance, if you see the Farrelly Brother's names appear anywhere in the credits then you know there's a fair chance that there's going to be an element of tastelessness at some point.   And, of course, this effort from Farrelly cohort James B. Rogers doesn't disappoint the hairdressing scene early in this movie easily stands comparison with the infamous zipper scene from TSAM; in fact this is one of the few scenes in a movie that has succeeded in making me cry out with revulsion (and that includes every horror movie I've ever seen).   But there was a smile on my face when I cried out.That SAY IT ISN'T SO lacks the impact of TSAM is inevitable.   Three years after the granddaddy of gross-out movies had appeared a degree of market saturation meant that by 2001 its predecessors all seemed to pale a little in comparison.   However, there is a lot to recommend in this flick.   The tone is relatively upbeat throughout; there is a large sprinkling of funny moments (which is the most one can hope for from a mainstream Hollywood movie these days), and there are good performances to savour.   Sally Field steals the picture as the conniving mother of Heather Graham's character, cruelly mistreating her husband (victim of a stroke) and laughing at his many misfortunes while she endeavours to marry her daughter off to some rich prospect.   Orlando Jones also stands out as a Hendrix type with false legs (I once had a girlfriend who could fall asleep as quickly as his character does).   A few scenes are a little disjointed, suddenly introducing minor characters in the middle of the action and sometimes ending a little abruptly, but, that aside, as long as you know the type of entertainment you are letting yourself in for, you won't be disappointed by this picture.

It is, to quote Devo, a beautiful world! For you! For you! Not ME!Into this ironic Shriners' Parade of Middle American ugliness--the true warts-and-all U.S. not seen in a cinema that spends most of its time on Manhattan's mean streets and in Beverly Hills High--a tiny flashlight of adolescent sweetness longs to shine. It's the true-blue, high-school-sweetheart brand of love that the Farrelly Brothers interpose as contrast to their fat-guy-in-a-Dacron-shirt cosmos. This is what gives the Farrellys' movies a tender/hysterical tone that recalls the alternations between beachside passivity and horrific violence in the movies of Beat Takeshi. It is their signature structure.SAY IT ISN'T SO is not one of their own--it's jobbed-out to some writer friends of the brothers, who have done a serviceable impersonation of the grotesqueries of the Farrellys. SAY IT is a programmer--it feels like a B movie, a bottom-half-of-the-double-biller, which is a nice, unusual feeling in this day and age (where genuinely B material is given a Big Movie importance). Chris Klein is the orphan longing to find his mom, and Heather Graham is the hopelessly inept hair stylist who loves him; DNA tests and stamped documents prove it after they have consummated their love--they're brother and sister. But incest is the least of this movie's concerns. The filmmakers strain to crank up the Farrelly Machine--which involves a new variant on punching a cow, shoving a paralyzed stroke victim's face into the smelly rump of an ugly truck driver, and a gag involving Sally Field's underarms that still makes me gag just thinking about it.Sweetness rules, though Graham and Klein are ideal as John Mellencamp's Jack and Diane. And after sitting through the massaging blandnesses of THE MEXICAN and HEARTBREAKERS, this movie's honest movement toward the emetic is refreshing. It shakes the audience up a little bit, rather than puts them to sleep. SAY IT doesn't approximate the high points of SOMETHING ABOUT MARY or KINGPIN, but its evocation of a world you won't see on VH-1 stays with you like the smell of grandma's doilies, mothballs, and brick-hard Brach's Candies.

He starts dating bad hairdresser Jo Wingfield (Heather Graham) after she cut off part of his ear. She had returned home to live with mother Valdine (Sally Field) and take care of paralyzed father Walter (Richard Jenkins). After six months, Gilly's search for a mother lands on Valdine. He becomes an outcast and a town joke. Jo runs away to start again in Oregon. She is set to marry Jack Mitchelson who is secretly a powerful drug lord. Then Leon Pitofsky comes with proof of being the actual boy that Valdine gave up for adoption. The Wingfields throw Gilly out. Gilly tries to get Jo back despite the world still thinking that they're siblings. Valdine works to stop him with Jack's help to spread news of his sick sibling sexual relationship.The Farrelly brothers produced this. Despite not being the directors, this one still has their trademark shock humor. However, none of it is funny to me. Some of the stuff is awkward. Everybody and everything is quirky. Comedy is very subjective and I didn't laugh at all. I don't think Chris Klein is a top rank comedian. His blank dumb face works on a narrow comedic path. He needs others to compliment him. The start is rushed with a lot of story to cram in. Farrelly fans may find the inappropriate subject hilarious but I need more than shock value for it to actually be funny.

A false allegation, a misunderstanding and BOOM, a whole town is pasted with SEX OFFENDER flyers condemning an innocent man. It reeked of trying to create laughter from a very sensitive subject. Shame on the writers for exploiting the subject and shame on the cast for pandering to it. If a film has to rely on a stigma to garner laughs, it's not for me. Had it not been for the exploitation, I probably would've given this movie a 6 or 7. Very disappointed.

Basically good-hearted Gilbert 'Gilly' Noble (American Pie's Chris Klein) finds the girl of his dreams with Josephine 'Jo' Wingfield (Heather Graham), and they quickly become lovers. Gilly is searching for his long lost mother, and unfortunately, the man who is looking for her announces it is Jo's mother Valdine (Sally Field), so Jo may be Gilly's biological sister, which means they break up, and everyone Gilly knows taunts him about his predicament. Things change however when the real son of Valdine and handicapped (because of a stroke) husband Walter (Richard Jenkins), Leon Pitofsky (Jack Plotnick) shows up, while Gilly travels back to see Jo before marrying Jack Mitchelson (Eddie Cibrian), even thinking of being a sibling, with the help of Dig McCaffrey (Evolution's Orlando Jones). Valdine knows Gilly is trying to get back to Jo, so she reports Gilly as an abuser to the police, so everyone is on the lookout for him, but he gets there in the end, and the brother-sister situation is resolved, they are not. Oh, and Gilly also finds his real biological mother, that being Suzanne Somers, who he apparently used to jerk off to! Also starring John Rothman as Larry Falwell and Mark Pellegrino as Jimmy Mitchelson. There are some amusing moments, but the idea of possible incest is still on your mind throughout, and I think that's why you can't really give a good reason to like it that much. Pretty poor!

For at least two generations now, crudity in film, humorous or otherwise, has been a booming American industry. I doubt the filmmakers were aspiring to be great, or even good, just funny, and while the film is uneven and falters in spots, it made us laugh out loud enough to be worth watching. Where the film's humor succeeds, it does so because it is served up absolutely deadpan, without leers, jeers or figuratively grabbing you and shouting, `Laugh! It's funny!' In this respect I think it is actually better than the film it is most often compared with, There's Something About Mary. Where the humor fails, it fails because the filmmakers abandon the light touch and deliberately strain for laughs.The plot Shelbyville, Indiana (a real place, at least on the map). Gilly Noble, a young man raised in an orphanage, meets Jo Wingfield, daughter of Walter and Valdine Wingfield, who has moved back to her home town to help out with her father, who has had a stroke. She has a millionaire boyfriend, Jack (Eddie Ciprian), where she has been living in Beaver, Oregon (another real place), but she and Gilly fall in love. Everything seems ducky until the corrupt, incompetent detective who is helping Gilly find his birth parents tells him that they are none other than Jo's parents, which means that Gilly and Jo are brother and sister. Jo leaves Shelbyville and goes back to Beaver, while Gilly moves in with his `parents.' Sixteen months later, Gilly hears that Jo is engaged to Jack and almost simultaneously learns that he is not really Jo's brother when the real brother, whom Valdine gave up for adoption when he was an infant, shows up, having finally found HIS birth parents. So now it's out to Oregon for Gilly to share the glad tidings with Jo before she makes the mistake of marrying Jack, who turns out to be a most unsavory character. After numerous adventures, of course, the boy gets the girl, and you assume they will live happily ever after in Shelbyville.Gilly (Chris Klein) is Our Hero; he is not just a naÃ¯f, he borders on simpleton, as is his love interest, Jo (Heather Graham). Graham chose to play Jo with a vacuous smile in the early scenes, to the point that it stretches credulity somewhat where she has to smarten up quite a bit toward the movie's end. These two mental defectives are made for each other. I hope they don't have kids; they'll be mixing very shallow gene pools. The real scene-stealers in this flick are Jo's parents Walter and Valdine, played by Richard Jenkins as a foul-mouthed stroke survivor who turns heroic in the end, but especially Sally Field as a sort of trailer-trash version of Mrs. Gump. Numerous other actors fill out their small roles with memorable performances as various thugs, cops and goons.The dialogue in this film is much funnier than the sight gags, which range from the merely weird to the painful to the disgusting. Early in the film, Jo accidentally cuts off the top of Gilly's right ear. For a long time after that, Gilly is filmed only in left profile, but eventually the filmmakers decide What the hell, and they go back to filming him in right profile, and the ear business is cheerfully forgotten; his hair covers the severed area and it is ignored. The longest sustained gag is also the least successful (and grossest) Gilly's progress toward the wedding venue is halted when his vehicle is blocked by a conveniently placed herd of cows. He tries to shove them physically off the road, punches one, and gets his arm stuck in the cow's rectum up to the elbow, and is dragged on foot what must be a couple of miles into town, in full view of the populace. This gag fails both in inspiration and execution. The obviously mechanical cow isn't even very convincing.

Except this film isn't directed by the Farrelly Brothers, but directed by a guy who has worked closely with them in James B. Rogers, who makes his debut with this film. I don't think the Farrelly Brothers have offered us much since 'There Is Something About Mary', so I don't think it's the direction that is the main issue here, as I think the material that James B. Rogers had wasn't that great in the first place. Maybe people are tired of gross-out comedies that don't have a great plot, or perhaps have the wrong cast! Like 'Shallow Hal', 'Say It Isn't So' is one of the worse written plots I've ever seen- with some extremely bad dialogue, and the lack of talent to pull it off. Yet 'Say It Isn't So' had more laughs that 'Shallow Hal'- yet the latter seems to have more honorable intentions although misconceived. 'Say It Isn't So' is just plain stupid, and the first half is excruciatingly unfunny with a few minor chuckles. Stay with the movie for awhile, and things get better comedy wise and plot-wise, yet not enough to sustain or even save this wreck! It's not the type of humour that will have you in stitches during, or even a nice chuckle well after the film. It's completely forgettable, and Chris Klein or Heather Graham add to this film, not even Oscar winner Sally Field helps here.I don't mind gross-out humour and bad jokes at all, in fact I'm a fan- but when the plot is so stupid and the comedy is poorly executed, then I question the purpose of the film.

These types of movies have started to lose a there appeal and b there spontaneity. The movie Say it isn't so was most evident of this. While I did have a few laughs, there are some rude and disgusting jokes, and a theme to a film that is not only twisted, but down right degrading.Everything in earnest, young Gilly Noble's life is finally going right. He's got a job he enjoys, he's marrying Jo, the girl of his dreams, and he's just a step away from finding his birth parents. But all that is about to come to a crashing halt and a year later, after losing his job and his girl, Gil sets out to get back Jo and make his life right again. The problem is, Jo has gotten engaged in their time apart, and her wealthy husband to be and social climbing mother are not about to let Gilly take her back without a fight. Chaos ensues as our hero finds himself in one comical predicament after another, all this to win back his true love.This movie had a cast of some known and unknown actors. The main star was American pie&#145;s Chris Klein, who in my opinion is nothing to boast about. His role in this film was average, with I guess the script bringing him down a bit. He has done one good role, that of (get role) in Election which was a good teen film. Yet this role was silly and ridiculous. The only saving grace was the relationship that Gilly has with Jo, which for sometime is ok.The other main star of Say It isn't so was Heather Graham. Her role again was only average, again the script bringing her down. A talent such as Graham wasting her time with this movie is a real shame. She was great in Austin powers 2, but made a mistake doing this film. Also making an appearance in this movie was screen-legend Sally Field. Her role was rather idiotic in my view, she needs to get back a good movie role, such asThe theme of Say It Isn't So was what I found most disturbing. Having two people who were both romantically and sexually involved is fine, but then to make out that the two are both brother and sister was just disgusting. This sort of viewing could harm some people if this situation was to actually happen, and it would also be harmful to young people who take the jokes from this  into their everyday lives and hurt people by them.Let's hope one sex day comedy films can once again be a heap of fun, and not so crude, rude and repulsive, because basically that is all this movie was. Relationships are very important in our lives and to make fun of them through a movie is not good to see. Having gone through a rough trot with a person who does not care about you, is extremely tough and knowing that they don't care is even harder to forget. This movie was very hard for me to enjoy as it was doing this very thing to the main character for a lot of the movie.

The kind of film that gets so painfully unfunny that you know it can't turn itself around, so you just have to wait it out and hope it doesn't leave a scar. It's the kind of movie that takes place in Beaver, Oregon because it is apparently funny to say the word beaver. The set-up is this Chris Klein falls in love with Heather Graham, then learns that she's his sister. It seems like perfect material for the Farrelly Brothers (There's Something About Mary, Kingpin), who specialize in low-brow, toilet humor (and I mean that in a good way). But this film wasn't directed by the Farrelly Brothers, it was produced by them. The directing chores (and I do mean chores) fall to James Rogers (the Farrelly Brothers' usual 1st Assistant Director).When a movie is this bad, you try to figure out where it went wrong. I think in order for this stuff to be funny, we have to empathize with the characters. We have to feel bad for them, but we laugh because, thankfully, what's happening to them isn't happening to us. The problem here is that every character in the movie acts like an idiot. They don't even know to be embarrassed when embarrassing things happen to them. And really, if everyone in the world was stupid, how would we know anyone was stupid. We need a point of reference, someone smart to compare to the stupid people so that we may accurately point and say, This person is an idiot. Maybe it's this way because the filmmakers figured if the characters in the movie don't question the ridiculous plot turns, we won't notice them either.SAY IT ISN'T SO just tries too hard to be funny. The attempts at gross-out humor are desperate. Rogers follows the Farrelly brothers' template way too strictly - every gag plays like a re-tread of a gag that worked in another movie. Chris Klein tries to disguise himself by making a beard out of pubic hair. (Or, how can we try to top Cameron Diaz' hair in Mary?) Sally Field makes her husband's sandwich saltier by rubbing it under her armpits (Can everyone say Road Trip?). It's ridiculous and it's insulting.For me, the Farrelly brothers are hit-or-miss. There's Something About Mary and Dumb and Dumber worked, Kingpin and My, Myself & Irene didn't. Say It Isn't So is easily the worst movie on this list, and may be the worst movie I see all year.MILTON SAYS  GARBAGE (F)For more MILTON reviews, check our website (IMDB rules prohibit me from giving the address, but here's a hint - look at my email address.) "}{"Title":"Another Farrelly dud","Date":"1 October 2001","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  The Farrelly Brothers are back, this time as producers, trotting out yet another tired variation on a once brilliant theme.  This hit or miss comedy is another `There's Something About Mary' wannabe that falls far short of that standard.  The film unquestionably has its hilarious moments, but the once funny hair lick gag has lost its luster and the film relies far too frequently on desperately crass bits that fall flat.  The sight of Chris Klein with his arm stuck in a cow's rear end is not remotely funny and to drag that bit out for ten minutes is torturously vapid.Fundamentally, the Farrellys are proving themselves to be a one trick pony with little fresh material emerging since `Mary' and an increased reliance on low-brow, revolting comedy to compensate for the fact that their creative tanks are apparently running on empty.  Director J.B. Rogers brings nothing new to the table, seemingly content with following the threadbare Farrelly formula.Heather Graham sparkles with a vivacious performance, despite being underutilized.  Graham's peculiar beauty and her quirky demeanor make her perfect for offbeat romantic comedy roles, and she provides a bright spot here as Klein's love interest.  Chris Klein is no dynamic actor, but his good looks and pleasantly hapless demeanor are a good fit for the role.  The best comedy is provided by Orlando Jones and veterans Sally Field and Richard Jenkins, whose comic delivery and physical comedy are terrific on all counts.This film has glimmers of comedic brilliance, but far too few to make it more than another mediocre footnote on the Farrelly Brothers decaying resumes.  I rated it a 6/10.  Add a point if you enjoy low brow gross-out humor.

Case in point The Farrelly Brothers, who have achieved massive success with a string of bad-taste movies about, amongst other things, Siamese twins, split personality, and extreme obesity.But Say It Isn't So isn't written by the Farellys (only 'produced by')&#151;and it isn't funny.Chris Klein (whose movie career is surely on its last legs) plays Gilbert, a loser who falls in love with beautiful hairdresser Jo (Heather Graham), only to find out that she is his sister.Incest. Yes, I do believe incest has the potential to be funny. But not in the hands of writers Peter Gaulke and Gerry Swallow or director James B. Rogers, who deliver a laugh-free train-wreck of a film that almost hurts to watch.I say 'almost', because, being a red-blooded male, the sight of the delectable Ms. Graham eases the pain. Heather can always be relied upon to make a film bearable, simply by being Heather. And this is the film's only saving grace.

Nothing about this movie was remotely amusing or good. The acting was awful from all involved and a definite career low for all of them( which is saying something for Chris Klein who is, at best, pretty damn awful). It was so bad that I couldn't even watch all of it. I really cannot understand why anyone would find this film remotely amusing or like anything about it apart from the end credits. If, for some unknown reason, someone out there does want to watch this film, I seriously suggest that you take my advice and stay well clear of it. This film is, god forbid, nearly as bad as Ghosts of Mars, which is definitely one of the worst films i have ever seen.

The plot was written by a 15 year old and the jokes were lame. Maybe if it was written and directed by the Farrelly Brothers maybe it could have stood a chance. As usual Heather Graham prounced around looking pretty but can't act for her life and Chris Klein as usual plays the doofy happy go lucky nice guy like he has done in all of his movies . Even Sally Field couldn't save this movie. There are so many times I wanted to scream when you turn around and the movie dragged on more over something stupid popping up. I hated this more as American Pie 2 because it dragged and was unfunny. If you want something to put you to sleep turn this movie on and in 5 minutes you'll be asleep. If you want to watch something funny skip past this movie quick and find something more decent than this. * out of ********.

This one is about a young bachelor named Gilly Noble (Chris Klein) who falls in love with the town barber, Jo Wingfield (Heather Graham). After six months of going out with her, he is shocked to discover she might be his sister. Jo freaks out and leaves town to marry a rich jerk named Jack. Once Gilly discovers Jo is not his sister, he goes out to find her. This is when the laughs kick in. Gilly meets Dig (Orlando Jones) who knows what a jerk Jack is so he decides to help Gilly. Dig isn't the only people Gilly meets. He also meets three others guys sent to kill him! What stops SAY IT ISN'T SO from as memorable as DUMB & DUMBER is the wooden performance from star Chris Klein. Klein looks and acts like a poor man's Keanu Reeves, which is is why it is unfortunate he is the lead here. Heather Graham is surprisingly good in her role, but it is really the talented Orlando Jones who gives the best performance here as Dig. Orlando Jones is used to making people laugh while Chris Klein and Heather Graham are kind of new at the whole comedy genre, although this isn't your average comedy. It contains some of the funniest moments in move history including a scene where Klein gets his hand stuck up a cow's rear end. As sick as it may be, it does provide hundreds of laughs. The Farrely brothers have not made a bad movie yet, and I don't think they ever will!

Its gross out gags and sexual humour worked reasonably well and at least entertained us, but what I didn't like about it is that it spawned such awful wannabee movies like `SAY IT ISN'T SO' and `TOMCATS'. Saying that, Tomcats is a comic masterpiece in comparison as SIIS is not only gross out but deeply unfunny, and seems to go on forever and ever when you just couldn't care less anymore and want it to end.  Tip - when a film has the tag  `(famous name here) presents&#133;&#133;..' or `executive produced by (famous name)' its nearly always a big pile of cr*p. This is the type of film that tries so hard for laughs its embarrassing.

I am 'NOT giving away the movie I will destroy it by using it as a coaster. That the actors voluntarily signed on this movie is hard to understand. Dignity FFS.Someone said in an earlier post that you could enjoy the movie without having to be intellectual... I would say it helps not having a brain at all! Living just in a town I can see people having not the slightest idea how to retract their hand out of a cowbutt, BUT it's also impossible to by accident end up with a hand in any living creatures rear. Thats where I stopped after the lead male actor was about to reinsert it after he successfully managed to withdraw it, because the girls (leading female actors) diamondring was lost in there.

This film shouldn't have been made. It is waste of time and there wasn't even a moment Say It Isn't So cracked me up. All along the film, I look at the screen and watched some meaningless dialogues. There might be weak links in most of the movies but a few things change audiences view in a good way such as strong performances from actors etc. Unfortunately, this is not happening here either. It is a lightweight movie but come on!! If someone finds out that the girl she is in love with is actually his sister, you do some more research. I wasn't looking for such answers before seeing the movie but after having had no laugh I feel that I have to be a bit more harsh and critical on this one. Definitely weak but also irritating. * out of ***** "}{"Title":"Farrelly Brothers' worst movie","Date":"18 April 2005","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" What were they thinking? In this movie, Say It Isn't So, An orphan (Chris Klein) who lives in a mid western town and works for a dog kennel falls for a hairdresser (Heather Graham) who might be his sister. Everything about this movie is just one clichÃ©d and not to mention vulgar monstrosity. In the Farrelly Brothers' movies the characters usually travel cross country. In this one it's from Indiana to Beaver Oregon. And as any moron can see, this movie wasn't filmed in either of those states. I've been to Oregon, and it doesn't look like that in this movie.The worst part of the whole movie were those kids at the dinner table, just horribly nauseating. I felt like vomiting after I saw that scene! All in all, Say It Isn't So, is the worst movie the Farrelly Brothers have ever made. If you're a fan of their work, see Me, Myself, and Irene, Stuck on You, or Dumb and Dumber instead. What was Heather Graham thinking when she agreed to be in this movie? How did Chris Klein get into acting? Even There's Something About Mary is better than this pathetic excuse for a comedy. This movie will make you want to throw your television out the window. "}]
