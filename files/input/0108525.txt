Needless to say, this does not compare to the original. However, this film is pretty good. Myers and Carvey are back with just as much wit and splendid timing as the original. This time they are opposed by the brilliance of Christopher Walken who, as usual, plays his part to a tee. The plot of setting up a festival does not have the power of that of the original and I was not crazy with the Jim Morrison character. The amount of cameos was a bit too extreme at time as what seemed like every other shot had some other famous person wanting to be part of the film. You would think that a film like this would not be as good hearted as it is, but it really is just a good film on so many levels. It's not a must see like it's predecessor, but I would still recommend it to anyone.

Mike Myers comes up with a lot of creative characters and he hit the nail in the head with Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar. After the huge success of Wayne's World, it was pretty obvious that they could go for another round. Unfortunately Wayne's World 2 wasn't as big of a splash as the original, but it still made me laugh so hard. As stupid as it was and some of the jokes were a little recycled, I still had such a great time watching this movie. It's silly and over the top, but how could you not have fun with Wayne and Garth? This is a fun sequel that should be given a fair chance.Wayne and Garth are a year older and everything has stayed basically the same, except Wayne has moved out of his parents' house and lives with Garth in an abandoned factory loft in Chicago. Wayne has a dream where he meets Jim Morrison and a weird naked Indian, in which Morrison tells Wayne that his destiny is to organize and put on a big concert. Cassandra, meanwhile, spends a lot of time out of town where she is working with record producer Mr. Big on recording music. Her new producer, Bobby Cahn, slowly tries to seduce her away from Wayne. After Wayne admits that he was spying on her, Cassandra breaks off the relationship and hastily gets engaged to Bobby on the rebound. Garth meets a beautiful woman, Honey Hornee, at the laundromat, and she quickly ropes him in with her charms. Wayne and Garth re-enter Wayne's previous dream and meet Jim Morrison again. They decide to go for one more try and make Waynestock a success, get Cassandra back, and see if Garth can find real love since his new girl is kinda homicidal.Honestly if someone asked me if Wayne's World 2 is worth the watch, I'd definitely say yes. This is always guaranteed a good laugh, just Garth's story alone with Kim Bassinger as Honey Hornee is worth the look. I also love the scene where the guys end up in a gay bar and end up singing Y.M.C.A. song, I nearly died laughing. Also Christopher Walken is in this movie, what more do you need to watch a movie? Christopher was such a great addition to the characters and made a great villain. It was great to see all the characters back together and this was a fun sequel, so if you need a good laugh, don't hold back, this is a movie that is sure to tickle you're funny bone.7/10 "},{"Title":"One of the few sequels that is better than the original!","Date":"17 June 2004","Score":"26 out of 44 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Music","Review":"  One of the biggest hits of 1992, the original WAYNE'S WORLD is a definite classic and is one of the funniest movies of 1990's, but I am not a big fan of sequels so I tried to avoid watching WAYNE'S WORLD 2 for a while. Eventually, I finally got around to watching WAYNE'S WORLD 2 and found it to be surprisingly better than the original. Part of the reason the movie succeeds is because it has one of the greatest casts in movie history with appearances by Christopher Walken, Heather Locklear, Bob Odenkirk, Robert Smigel, Kevin Pollak, Kim Basinger, Chris Farley, Drew Barrymore, Ted McGinley, Tim Meadows, Jay Leno, Charlton Heston, Ed O'Neill, and Aerosmith. I'm not saying that a good cast automatically makes a movie great, but in this case, it certainly helps. The gags in WAYNE'S WORLD 2 are definitely more random and bizarre than the ones in the original, making it even more fun than I expected it to be. Some of these random jokes don't work as well as they should, though overall it's still a hilarious movie that is good to watch with your friends. ***1/2  "},{"Title":"Good Sequel","Date":"22 May 2001","Score":"14 out of 21 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Music","Review":"  This is a good sequel to the original film.

It's impact on kids during that time rivaled things like the NES, Beavis & Butthead & Nike Air Jordan's. I think many people, several years older or younger than myself could see both movies back to back and love them equally. Everyone sees things differently for their own perspective.For about a year after the release of Wayne's World, I'd heard practically every single line from that movie repeated in conversation, multiple times at one point or another. The references to that movie were used so frequently, it was almost becoming a new language spoken by everyone under 20.Then, it became much like a really eccentric person you befriend who quickly goes from being interesting -- to just plain annoying...By the time Wayne's World 2 was released, the quirky, spontaneous, feel good personality that everyone loved about the first one, was basically absent and the gimmick was totally worn out.It's extremely hard to put into words, but the first one just had a fun, hilarious, intimate feel about it that people could relate to. By Wayne's World 2; Wayne, Garth, and even Wayne's girlfriend had all gone in different directions and it lost the fun, friendly, party feel to it. The spontaneous nature of the jokes were gone and everything felt scripted. It was no longer fun to watch, but rather -- tedious.In my opinion, the pop culture icon known as Wayne's World, marked the end of the fun, good times, partying and close friendships of the '80s. Wayne's World 2 marked the beginning of the stale, rehashed, lazy & alienated '90s. As most people realize, the generation/era that was the '80s (and everything that made it iconic) didn't end on Dec, 31 1989. Just as every other generation, it carried on for a few more years into the beginning of the next decade.I've never found a better example to demonstrate the end of one generation and the beginning of another as I have by watching Wayne's World & Wayne's World 2.At least from my perspective...

This dream leads to Wayne and Garth (Dana Carvey) trying to pull off a music festival in their small town. While all of this is going on Wayne finds himself losing Cassandra (Tia Carrere) to a shady record producer (Christopher Walken).While there aren't quite as many memorable moments as the first film, overall I think this is a rare case where a rushed sequel is every bit as funny as the original. It didn't take the producers long to realize that the film film was a hit and this here was rushed into production, which usually means you're going to end up with a watered down product. That certainly wasn't the case here because WAYNE'S WORLD 2 has the two leads in fine form and we've got some terrific supporting characters as well as some great music.There are many highlights here but you've got to give a lot of credit to the two leads. Both Myers and Carvey are pitch perfect in their performances and there's no question that their charm is what makes this film and the original so memorable. Their characters are usually the annoying types that you see in movies but the actors manage to make them incredibly likable, funny and at times adorable. It certainly doesn't hurt that they're given some wonderful supporting players including the always brilliant Walken playing the shady record producer. His serious and dark tone fits in perfectly with the laid back humor. We've also got Kim Basinger doing a wonderful job in her role of the woman who seduces Garth. Throw in Aerosmith, Rip Taylor and Chris Farley and you've got a fun cast.WAYNE'S WORLD 2 has several hilarious scenes but one of the highlights is the seduction of Garth who finally gets to be with a woman. This entire sequence is just perfectly handled and it milks every laugh that it can get. Fans of the original are usually mixed in regards to which film is better. It's really too bad that a third film never followed but I guess it's never too late to bring these rockers back.

I saw this film before the first one in a motel with my wife circa 1994-95 and, by the end, I was crying I was laughing so hard. The scene that put me over the edge was when a certain classic actor appears as a gas station attendant.Memorable moments abound The encounter with the albino-eyed city official, Wayne's martial arts fight with Cassandra's father, Wayne's visions with Morrison and the half-naked Indian, and many more.The original film is actually a let-down compared to this one. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid comedy and consistently amusing if you're in the mood for goofy humor rooted in 70s-90s rock/metal, but there are a number of flat areas. This sequel flows better and is way funnier. It helps if you're up on the rock/metal scene and cinema though, otherwise you won't get half the jokes.I gauge comedies by how funny they are (naturally), as well as how compelling, and Wayne's World 2 delivers exceptionally on both fronts.

Yeah, I know, that last comment of mine was incredibly creative. Thank you.Now, let me just pull my thoughts together. I guess there's much more to say about Wayne's World 2 if only for the fact that I accidentally saw it before the first one, without that parameter ruining any kind of excitement, on the contrary, I must say. In fact, I was so confident that if a sequel (well, it's more of a continuation like I said) were 'excellent', for a lack of better word, then the first one would be a no-disappointment guarantee. At the end, whether you watch the second or the first one at first, just make sure you watch both, these are truly comedic treasures, and certainly the best movie-and-its-sequel pairing of the 90's.So, we meet Wayne again as the host of the public access TV Show of the same name, and nothing has changed, it's still Wayne, Garth, the name-less cavemen-looking operators, the same concept, and for our greatest delight the same catchphrase Wayne's World, Wayne's World! Party on! Excellent, followed by the obligatory concluding riff. There are a few changes though the program is not set in the parent's basement anymore and this time, it's aired a little earlier because they have backstage pass for an Aerosmith concert. What would be the series without the Rock'n'roll Gods' blessings after all? And before joining the iconic Mirthmobile, Wayne welcomes us back, providing some interesting insights about how things have changed in case we hadn't noticed. How could we? Apparently, he got 'hair in some weird places'; Garth had 'pubes' (Allelujah! We want to shout), and he's still dating the sexy Cassandra who's trying to make her name big in the Rockosphere. Beyond the humor, what works so well in this little moment is the immediate connection we share with Wayne, the same feeling as when we meet an old friend after a long summer vacation. Yet Wayne's World 2 never takes the initial success for granted, and remains truly original. The 'Bohemian Rhapsody' head-banging was such a defining moment of Wayne's World that recycling it with another song would have seriously compromised the credibility of the film. Instead, when they get in the car, they simply listen to a program animated by a host named 'Handsome Dan'. We don't pay much attention to this detail, but it makes the pay-off even more hilarious. Like its predecessor, Wayne's World trusts both our patience and intelligence and we know every obscure moment ought to have a pay-off.And that's precisely what Wayne figures when he meets weird workers stacking in crates chicken and watermelons, making sure they're plenty of them while others walk back and forth with a big plate-glass window every couple of minutes. And when Wayne disguises as a lamppost repairer, Garth as a traffic cop, and the two teammates as a biker and sailor, to spy on Cassandra and are fatally chased by Bobby, her agent, hell, we also know this is going somewhere. It's like a little game between the screenwriters and us, but no matter what we expect, it doesn't make the punch line less enjoyable.Now, I don't know if at 300 lines left from the review, I'll have time to cover the whole plot, nor that all the information would be necessary because if you spent twenty years without watching the film, either you're a mental or a movie lover &#x85; not, or you were born in the 90's, or worse, after. But well, let's clarify it, Cassandra is as hot and sweet as ever, and Christopher Walken doesn't need much to be convincing as the slick, smart and flirtatious record producer, so condescending toward Cassandra's nerdy friends. Well, I shouldn't call nerds guys who reject other nerds, but then I should find another word to describe sweet and lovable losers with devouring passions and unfulfilled talents.The plot Wayne follows a weird naked Indian during a bizarre dream and meets Jim Morrison in the middle of the desert. Jim tells Wayne that he should make something of his life, like a concert in Aurora. A colorful and experienced roadie named Del Preston would help them. How to be sure Aerosmith, Rip Taylor, Van Halen and even a weird old man making a canoe out of a log would come? If you book them, they will come And then Wayne's Works worlds like a field of dream-like creativity where nothing is gratuitous for the sake of a gag. I mentioned that every gag had a pay-off, in fact, the best ones are still totally random, served by so many cameos it's impossible to enumerate them all. Let me just pick three favorites, James Hong as Cassandra's father and his Zangly hilarious kung-fu style badly dub confrontation with Wayne and Kim Basinger as the so Schwing-inducing Honey Hornee who probably contributed to one of the funniest exchanges ever, in a record-time of less than twenty seconds Take me Where?

The original film is incredibly popular among fans and could now be considered somewhat of a cult classic, spawning numerous catchphrases and making the unique look of Wayne and Garth a very recognizable get-up. And then we come to it's sequel, the aptly named Wayne's World 2. This new Wayne and Garth story is stupid, silly, goofy, over-the-top, and yet really entertaining. It is set a year after the first film. Wayne and Garth are still doing their TV show, but now Wayne is starting to realize that maybe it is time to do something with his life. So he decides he is going to put on a huge rock and roll festival called Waynestock in order to prove to himself, his girlfriend Cassandra, and Cassandra's strict father, that he is capable of greatness.The original Wayne's World is absolutely one of the funniest movies ever, and it ranks very high amongst my favorite comedies. Thus, I was skeptical going into a sequel. To do the entire Wayne's World experience over again would be near impossible with the original being such a classic. I was expecting a very poor rehashing that tried to beat the original at its own game, thus being terribly unfunny. But I was mistaken in thinking this. Wayne's World 2 knows it can't outdo Wayne's World so it doesn't try to. It is its own silliness and absurdity. It has the same kind of humor as the original and the character of Wayne and Garth haven't changed and are still hilarious, but it is certainly not the original film all over again. Plus, this film is still hilarious. There are great laugh out loud moments that remind us why we love Wayne and Garth and all that they stand for. I was expecting this film to be good for no more than a chuckle or two, so one can imagine my surprise when I found myself cracking up at moments of the film.Now, all things considered, this movie is still really, really dumb. As much as I laughed, there are still the jokes that work and then the jokes that don't work. The jokes that work are hilarious, the ones that don't work are awful, eliciting a shameful rolling of the eyes from me. And then of course we have the story, which isn't anything to get excited about. It's obvious, predictable, simple, and unoriginal. But let's face it, this movie wasn't made for it's story. It's made for the jokes and the great shtick that the Wayne and Garth characters pull off. The atmosphere of Wayne's World is something very important to how the series works, and this was the more important aspect in making this a funny film, not the storyline. I could go on and on about plot, character development, structure, etc, but I would just be wasting my time. The point is, Wayne's World 2 is just here to make you laugh.Wayne's World 2 isn't a fantastic film by any means. It really can't even hold a candle to the original. But it still made me laugh and seeing Wayne and Garth in action again was great. You can't get tired of these lovable characters played so well by Mike Meyers and Dana Carvey that you just don't care how dumb the movie is. I don't see myself quoting Wayne's World 2 like I quote Wayne's World, and that's assuming I quote Wayne's World 2 ever. But I don't regret watching it and for a sequel to a great classic, it isn't all that bad. Sincere kudos go out to the filmmakers for making a successfully better than expected film out of Wayne's World 2.

On Wayne's World, Wayne announces a benefit party they were throwing one night. They made tons of the green so they successfully booked the concert arena in Stevenson Memorial Park. They also went on the radio with Handsome Dan. Wayne and Garth said they'd get such rock sensations as Aerosmith, Van Halen, and Rip Taylor! As for Bobby, he began to get close to Cassandra. Wayne and his buds spied on them. Wayne dressed as a construction worker, Garth was a cop, Neil was a leather-clad biker and Terry was a sailor. Bobby chases them into a men's club where they're mistaken as The Village People! Soon Cassandra brings her father to meet Wayne. He takes an immediate dislike to him. Wayne and Mr. Wong get into a Cantonese language battle, followed by a dubbed-English Martial Arts fight. Mr. Wong finally accepts Wayne after the battle. Garth, meanwhile, found the love of his life Honey Horneé. The two just hit it off, but Garth runs when she wants him to kill her ex-husband.         Soon the concert, or Waynestock, was ready to begin. Cassandra had traveled to Los Angeles with Bobby and appeared on The Tonight Show. Bobby had been picked out by Mr. Wong! He and Cassandra were to be married so Wayne took off to the church in the Waynemobile which unfortunately met with a terrible accident so Wayne borrowed a red convertible that was parked by the scene of the accident. He arrived at the church just in time and he and Cassandra bolt back to the park. Amazing! A week ago they hadn't sold a single ticket, now hippies and groupies from miles around where all gathered at the park. The bands were not coming and it looked as if Garth would be the one to break the news to everyone. Wayne and Cassandra arrive then. Wayne speaks to Jim Morrison again and he confirmed that the band wasn't coming. Wayne and Garth first try to end the movie using the Thelma and Louise ending, but they then decide to use the happy ending in which Rip Taylor and Aerosmith arrive along with the Weird Naked Indian! The concert was on and Wayne and Garth had gotten the respect they so richly deserved and they had finally done something with their lives!!          Wayne's World 2 was just as good as Wayne's World. Mike Myers is back as our excellent host, Wayne Campbell and Dana Carvey is back as our other excellent host, Garth Algar. Tia Carrere is back as Cassandra. Ed O'Neill is back as Glen, Chris Farley is back as Milton, and joining the cast are Christopher Walken as Bobby Cahn, and Kim Basinger as Honey Horneé. Watch for fellow Saturday Night Live cast member Tim Meadows as Sammy Davis Jr.! There never was a Wayne's World 3. If there was, what could it be about? Wayne and Garth middle-aged? With kids??!! As if! But for now we can enjoy Wayne's World 1 and 2. I liked the trailer in which there was an extreme close-up at the Paramount logo. I liked the trailer for Wayne's World 1 too where they're in the car singing Bohemian Rapsody! I saw it on the Addams Family movies videos. But anyway, if you saw the first Wayne's World, then common knowledge dictates that you should most definitely see Wayne's World 2. Party on! Wayne's World! Wayne's World! Party time! Excellent!

However by the time this movie had made it to cable TV, the entire concept just seemed way over done. Having a profitable movie can cause these types of situations. Of course a sequel will be made, and then the goal is keeping the material fresh, and finding new things for your characters to do. Wayne's World 2 is really just a rehashing of the same ideas from the original mixed with numerous cameos, other movie references, and ideas that just don't always pay off with the laughter that Myers may have intended.The story picks up with Wayne and Garth still doing their public access TV show, just like in the original. Wayne is still jealous of his girlfriend Cassandra's career and male attention, just like in the original. In order to prove his own worth, Wayne decides to throw a huge outdoor music festival to apparently make things right with the world again. Things culminate with the appearance of Aerosmith making their second cameo of the movie. There are some truly funny moments that mostly involve Chris Farley as a roadie wanna be, and Garth trying to woo Kim Basinger. Christopher Walken's appearance is welcome of course as a romantic rival for Cassandra's affection. Also a funny cameo from James Hong as her father.Alas, the magic just isn't there this time, and it was certainly time for Mike Myers to move on from this character. Penelope Spheeris was not on board this time as she, like so many others, found Mike Myers impossible to work with. Now after the failure of The Love Guru, it is unclear if Myers has anything new left in him. If Wayne's World 2 comes on, you might want to keep hitting buttons on your remote control every few minutes to see if something better is out there. 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.

Is it a joke that I didn't catch on clearly ? For instance after the closing credits there is a scene where the Indian cries after seeing all the garbage on the concert grounds and garbage being thrown from a car, which lands at his feet. Well, the trivia section tells us that this mimics a public service announcement featuring Iron Eyes Cody which premiered in 1971. So, as you see the jokes this time need a guide or a dictionary to be understood!There is nearly no real comic situation. Just things like the pointless conversation between (Myers) and the extremely HOT young (Drew Barrymore). Or jokes like the one about the employee's strange eye. All what you'd have is matters such as wearing like The Village People then meeting accidentally in a gay bar which's so fabricated. Or parodies with no creativity or whatsoever like Thelma & Louise's one. Or unfinished story lines like the Double Indemnity's spoof with Kim Basinger. It's weird the way this movie deals with its material, refusing to make any complete comedy out of it.Scene like the one in which (Walken) doesn't understand Myers's joking about the Leprechaun, or others with (Myers) talking to us about hitting the puberty lately, or a perfectly innate and naive adolescent stuff like saying SCHAAWING when seeing any sexy girl; they simply tell about the leads' childish silly kind of jest. Although it's an attractive special point apart, but to tell you the truth it wasn't that special this time with nothing to support either.It didn't work altogether. What I sensed isn't a heavy self-confidence, or a desire to reuse the jokes of the first very successful hit. I only sensed misunderstanding towards the world of movies. As a matter of fact this movie is so pale and so lame TV sketch after another (while the first was just pale and lame TV sketch after another!). Plus another problem which's the size of the parodies that they put. I mean the plot, which's thin, became too thin with many buffoonery concerning  The rock singers, TV commercials, TV series, Kung-Fu flicks and cinema classics like (The Graduate &#x96; 1967). It's not another parody of so many movies like (Hot Shots! Part Deux), (National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1) or even one movie (Robin Hood Men in Tights) all produced in the same year by the way. It's trivial mishmash of toying related only to its makers, making - only them - the ones to laugh !, being close to the leads' channel in the movie; something few ones receive and enjoy.Among an atmosphere as desperately half-good-joke-every-minute as this, you've got to be sad with the fact that this movie got big names that should've made it better. Stars like (Walken, Basinger, Locklear and Chris Farley) the movie uses them to do nothing at all! Then the pretty and comic (Carrere) is totally literally wasted this time. And finally comedian like (Dana Carvey) with this persona which he presents, as an aspect and performance, was nothing but a genuine turn-off !The Wayne's World could've been Myers's early world to expose the game of cinema and make fun of it. Moments like seeing the workers who transport glass, chickens and watermelon vaguely in the street then understanding afterwards why they were here could've been an original moment to mock at the fakeness of the cinematic car chases. Or sneering at Paramount when it cuts the budget, sending 2 doubles to England instead of the 2 leads. All of those simple lovely ideas represent, primitively and immaturely, what Myers will pull off later in the Austin Powers movies with more unity, concentration and sure prosperity.All in all it was little movie about crazy characters (that we didn't watch their craziness) making unfunny jokes and too many swift, mostly dated, spoofs to end up as a movie that every now and then says something tries to move your mouth to smile then fails miserably.I only loved 3 things  the stunning red dress of Tia Carrere; when she was setting with Jay Leno (short, tight, and there is Tia Carrere in it !). The black leather shorts of (Kim Basinger) which she wore at one scene. And the amazingly unexpected appearance of one of Hollywood legends (Charlton Heston) in a very tiny role; yet the thing is this movie didn't utilize him appropriately, as it did all the way with all its cast, to say or do something comic, serious or memorable anyway.

It wasn't until 2005 when I saw both of them in their entirety for the first time. After my first viewings, I definitely preferred this sequel, but since then, I've seen both of them again, and now I'm not so sure. Judging by the ratings here, it looks like the first one is more popular, but I don't know which one I think is the stronger of the two. Right now, I don't think either of them are classics, but still think they're both reasonable comedies, despite how silly they are.A year has gone by, and Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar are still doing their show, but Wayne wishes to get farther in life, and doesn't know how he would do it. One night, in his dream, he meets the spirit of Doors frontman Jim Morrison, who tells him that he is to organize a rock concert, and that if he books bands, they will come! Immediately after Wayne wakes up, he tells Garth about his dream, and they soon begin their planning for a music festival called Waynestock. Following Jim Morrison's instructions, they recruit Del Preston, the world's greatest roadie, to help them. Trying to organize the show turns out to be difficult, and for Wayne, it doesn't help that he is once again having trouble with his rock star girlfriend, Cassandra Wong. Her manager, Bobby Cahn, is trying to lure her away from Wayne, so she will leave Aurora and move to L.A.! One thing I like about this Wayne's World sequel is the concert premise, since I find big rock concerts fascinating. Like I said, this is a silly comedy, but that doesn't necessarily make it a bad one. The second time I watched this 1993 comedy, I wasn't sure if it would be above average at first, but it improved. Neither movie is consistently hilarious, but both of them certainly have their moments. In Wayne's World 2, highlights I've found include the dubbed fight sequence between Wayne and Cassandra's father (can't seem to remember that from my first viewing, but it was a highlight of my second), and the Village People impersonation in the gay bar (which stood out for me during both viewings). Scenes with Garth and his new love interest can also be good for laughs, and there's definitely more (no need to mention it all).Sequels tend to be less popular than their predecessors. There are exceptions, but this is not one of them. On the other hand, it seems some people do like this one better than the original, and like said, I used to be one of them, but now I'm not sure. I might prefer this one to a very small degree, due to the premise, but the first time, I thought it was funnier than Wayne and Garth's first full-length adventure, but that didn't quite seem to be the case the second time. Nonetheless, 1 & 2 are both reasonable Saturday Night Live adaptations, better than Coneheads. Basically, Wayne's World 2 shows Wayne and Garth's usual antics once again, which are silly and obviously hated by some viewers, but if you're a fan of the two famous SNL characters, both films should make you laugh, at least in some parts, though you MIGHT prefer the characters in smaller doses.

While I was generally impressed with this sequel,I may've been a little let down by the hyper-extension of the jokes(this was,after all,the SECOND film based on a Saturday Night Live sketch that was nearly five years old),so I didn't have perhaps the most energetic response to this as I did,say,to Wayne's World from almost two years before. HAving said that,I had a basically favorable--sometimes riotous--reaction to having seen the continuing tale of Aurora's most famous basic cable metal heads.Wayne Campbell(Mike Myers)and Garth Algar(Dana Carvey)are still partying on with Wayne's Friday night cult TV hit,and Wayne's still with the Uber BAbe Cassandra(Tia Carrere). But things are changing Wayne is approached in a dream by JIm Morrison and a almost-naked Indian and told to set up a Mega-concert,a gathering of music that is coined as WayneStock. Getting that together is going to be quite the effort. Meanwhile,CAssandra is being swept into stardom--and out of Wayne's arms--by a slick,sharp promoter named Bobby Cahn(Christopher Walken,arguably to most malleable actor in the biz). Also,GArth not only gets his first pubes but also gets into an affair with a very forward tart named Honey Hornee(Kim Basinger). How can this be all solved,you ask? Well,with the help of Aerosmith and Rip Taylor(!) and a TON of movie,TV and pop culture references,viewer can rest assured that everything will resume being excellent in 95 minutes!I've seen this movie again recently,and I found myself laughing as much(perhaps more)and harder at plenty of the references. Also,I've come to recall some of the cameos that I may've missed or overlooked when I first saw it(Drew Barrymore as receptionist Bjergen Kjergen,James Hong as Cassandra's disapproving father,Chris Farley as an over-enthusiastic roadie-wanna-be named Milton,and Kevin Pollak as a clerk with two different eye colors are some that come to mind). Director Stephne Sjulzik may've not been able to copy the mojo of the surprise hit of 1992,but it's still a fun movie to watch repeat times.Since 1994,the characters of Wayne and Garth have quietly been escorted into the oblivion that is SNL sketch characters of the past. While I get that,it would be interesting to know what the creators of the series(that means,mostly,Myers and CArvey)have made out of their rocking,Canadianesque ids). My guess is that they're still partying on.

The movie feels like it never takes off. The problem with the story is that it doesn't focus on Wayne and Garth's TV show. In the original movie, the funny bits all involved the TV show, the set, or just Wayne and Garth hanging out on a Friday night. If Wayne's World 2 focused on Wayne's and Garth's struggle to continue the show, it would have worked.I always thought it would be funny if the plot in Wayne's World 2 involved Wayne and Garth quitting the show because they were sick of being famous. Then, the TV studio could introduce new guys to take their place, and the show would suffer. Then at the end, Wayne and Garth would come back..... and maybe have Waynestock! I think that would have been a better storyline. There just isn't enough with the show in this movie, and that is why it just isn't funny to me.I don't necessarily think that the jokes have gotten old, but I feel like they tried too hard to be funny during this one. (The subtitle joke was recycled, the three endings were recycled, the She will be mine was recycled, etc.) It makes me sad because I absolutely LOVE the first movie. There were so many iconic scenes like Bohemian Rhapsody, the guitar store, Garth dancing to Foxy Lady, and the part where the new song and sign are introduced to the show. Wayne's World 2 is not memorable. I actually feel like I wasted my time watching it.Overall, the original still remains supreme.

She brought to that film a sense of good comedy timing with the story (err, what wasn't already there between Mike Meyers, Dana Carvey and the others), but also a fresh sense of the reality in the guys-into-metal atmosphere that was abundant in the late 80's and into the early 90's. Her influence on the film is noticeable here, where director Stephen Surjik is more of a stand-in director for the proceedings; this time all the energy is in the script and the eccentric new actors along with our favorites. Watching it today I get a slightly different take on it from when I was a kid, back then when I couldn't care less about who directed it. But now I can tell, and it seems to miss the mark on achieving the greatness the first film did (though this goes without saying the first one did break ground not just for Saturday Night Live, but also in culture with many phrases becoming part of the 'youth' vernacular).But if there would be any reason at all to watch the film, aside from the rock and roll sub-texts (and here we do get 'Wayne-stock', ho-ho), it's for Meyers and Carvey, who are one of the best, if perhaps just the plain funniest, of the comic duos of the 90's. And together they have some hilarious scenes with Christopher Walken (a given) as Bobby, the producer with his eye for Cassandra (Tia Carrere, gorgeous as always); Harry Shearer as the DJ Handsome Dan; Ralph Brown as the demented ex-roadie Del Preston (featuring one of the funniest bits in both Wayne's World films, the 'M&M' speech); and the cameos from the likes of Ed O'Neill, Rip Taylor (yes, Rip Taylor), and Aerosmith. There is still that chemistry, if one could call that with comedy, between the two stars, that funny sense of how different and alike the characters are to one another, and the 'drama' that ensues. This all leads up to the concert, which was indeed started by Wayne's feverish dreams of Jim Morrison of the Doors (the Doors movie), and his Graduate-like trek to stop the wedding.So there is no drought of inspiration for the laughs, as they rip on movies at the time either very recent or classic, just as in the first film, and for a sequel it is still a pleasant, cool surprise ten years or so later. If only Spheeris had been on board.

Nickles), Aurora cable-TV sensation Wayne Campbell (Myers) announces his intention to hold a music festival to be headlined by rockers Aerosmith. As Wayne sets about organising the event with the help of friend Garth (Dana Carvey) and legendary roadie Del Preston (Ralph Brown), nasty record producer Bobby Cahn (Christopher Walken) attempts to seduce Wayne's girlfriend Cassandra (Tia Carrere).Wayne and Garth's second big-screen effort isn't quite as funny as their debut movie, the novelty factor not quite as high second time around. But despite the inevitable rehashes of some of the more successful elements from the first film, Wayne's World 2 still proves to be a lot of fun, with Mike Myers' special brand of surreal silliness providing some truly wonderful moments of zany humour.A crazy kung fu battle against Cassandra's father (James Hong); a very sexy Kim Basinger seducing virginal Garth; Wayne and his pals, dressed like The Village People, performing the YMCA dance in a gay club; Wayne and Garth failing to fool a fast-food restaurant drive-thru speaker; Drew Barrymore as sexy Swede Bjergen Kjergen; an awesome cameo by Charlton Heston this film has so many funny scenes that, even if some of the pop culture references don't work as well as today as they did twenty years ago, and at the end of the day Waynestock is essentially just an Aerosmith concert (no Pearl Jam or Van Halen), it still manages to be a whole lot of fun.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.

Tagging along hoping to make it really big is once again Tia Carrere. You know the Carrere that appears in both Wayne's World movies and virtually nothing else, not the porn star who is probably more well known and popular as she does not sing badly and her acting is on par with Tia. The concert part of this film makes for the best comedy in this one, while the whole Wayne/Cassandra romance once again makes up the weakest part of the film. Overall, that is pretty much what this film is, a bit weaker version of the first movie. When they are pulled over by the cop and it ended up being the cop from Terminator 2 that was rather funny and unexpected. Here there is a similar joke that is so telegraphed that it is not even mildly amusing and rather pointless. There is a rather funny scene in this one where Wayne meets Cassandra's dad and while it is cheesy and a bit like the scenes out of the Police Academy movies it still worked. The ending though is not quite as good though. In the end, this movie could have been good, part of the problems with this one might stem from the fact that this one was released so shortly after the first movie.

Very cleaver and nice message.. (it doesn't matter what you do, she loves you for who you are) is something many guys have to get in their heads.

Then came Waynes World 2 and I came to the conclusion that this film is ten times better than the original!Wayne and Garth are back in this rocking sequel where Wayne has a vision on how to improve Wayne's World and how to get his girlfriend Cassandra back from her new friend Bobby. He has a vision about an old rock and roll legend and a naked Indian telling him to put on a show, to book the stars and they will come. All they need is the greatest band preparer in the world. They travel all around the world and find him to bring him back to their home so they can start planning Waynestock where they promised, and lied, about people like Rip Taylor and Areosmith will appear and perform. Garth meets a beautiful girl at the dry cleaners and stays the night with her. Now when the big day comes, no bands have appeared and the crowd is getting angry, when Wayne hears that Cassandra and Bobby are getting married right this second. Can Wayne save his relationship and his show at the same time!?My first impression of the film, great sequel! Mike and Dana have brought back the goofy characters we all loved, I loved the Thelma and Luis scene at the end, and the old cast has returned as well like Chris Farley and Ed O'Neil. We have Christopher Walken as Bobby, the evil record recorder who tries to steal Cassandra away from Wayne and he must stop him. Great action and love fallows the scene after Wayne discovers the two are to be wed. The acting is as usual, good but not perfect and we have Arosmith perform for us at the beginning of the film and that rocks! This film reuses some of the first films old jokes, Ex-sqeeze me? A baking powder? Things like that but you get a lot of new and creative ideas, the Jurassic park was one of my favorites.

That's about it on plot.  So what?  It's a riot anyway!First off, the parodies are still extremely clever.  In particular is a scene early in the movie where several workers set up fruit carts in the middle of a street and carry a big pane of glass.  I caught why they were doing it, and waited eagerly for the pay-off.  It doesn't come till the end of the movie, however, which slightly kills it.  Many of the jokes are recycled, but fortunatly, the writers were smart enough to not go into overkill.  For example, the ending sequence is very similar to the first movie's ending (in which various different endings are tried), but it's not overly ripped off.  However, something that didn't continue was how Wayne and Garth would communicate with the camera, like in the first movie.  This was something particularly clever, and it could have worked again.  You also see much less of the comaderie of the movie's lead characters, which was something that the first movie had to a tee.

I didn't catch a single joke that really makes you laugh. It also rips off the first movie one to many times. One of the few movies I walked out of before the end. It wasn't going to get any better. I suggest you pass.

It does not try to change anything up and that probably keeps the film from sinking into an abyss of obscurity.  This time the boys want to have a Waynestock ala Woodstock to let people enjoy a lot of music and give them a lot of money. Oscar-winners, from other films, Kim Basinger and Christopher Walken do well with tongue-in-cheek roles.  2.5 out of 5 stars.

There are some funny scenes here, but the original was good enough. It seems like they just xeroxed everything. I think that Waynestock would probably be a neat event, but Wayne's World 2 really has little to show for itself. If anything, the strength lies in its cast. Aside from Mike Myers, Dana Carvey and Tia Carrere, there's also Chris Farley, Aerosmith, Charlton Heston, Kim Basinger, Kevin Pollak, and a whole bunch of others.But really, the first one was the clever one. I don't know why Hollywood feels that they have to make so many sequels (oh right they do it for money). Only watch this one if there's nothing else to do.

Admittedly, I watched this twice before trading it for something else. Probably to ogle Kim Bassinger one more time. I also thought this sequel was better than the first Wayne's World movie anyway. From what I see here, most people agree with that.Unfortunately, the second viewing was not as appealing (just too dumb) nor did I appreciate showing a minister blaspheming. That's Hollywood for you. Without the extreme irreverence in here, I might have held onto this just to have something stupid to laugh at once every few years....and to laugh at that scene when Dana Carvey meets Basinger in the laundromat .

Austin Powers is a one trick pony that probably doesn`t deserve to be a mega money making franchise but somehow is . WAYNE`S WORLD  works okay as a five minute TV spot but probably doesn`t deserve a full length feature film based on the characters never mind a sequel . In short I dislike the comedy genre and will only watch a comedy movie if there`s nothing else on . Nothing else happened to be on so I sat down expecting to suffer tedious American ninties expressions like  Party on dude  and  Excellent I must admit that while WAYNE`S WORLD 2 didn`t exactly have me rolling on the floor it was by no means an ordeal either . The loosely written plot revolves around Wayne trying to impress his girlfriend by holding a concert called Waynestock . There that`s the plot in a nutshell but makes the comedy so entertaining is that it`s politically incorrect while at the same time doesn`t go overboard on trying to shock and offend . Compare this amusing movie with FREDDY GOT FINGERED to see what I mean . It was also nice to see a few cameos too .If you`re not expecting too much I can recommend WAYNE`S WORLD 2  "}]
