Simple. It's a dark comedy. And let's face it, the general public doesn't like dark comedy. They want to see goofy, Jim-Carrey-type comedies that make you laugh out loud, while making you feel all warm and tingly inside. Lucky Numbers doesn't, for a second, make you feel warm and tingly. But I have a dark, cynical sense of humor and this movie was a delight for me to watch. It's a good idea, and it was well-executed. The talented cast helps make the film work. Lisa Kudrow is never fully convincing as her ruthless character, but she's still fun to watch. I do think John Travolta gives one of his best performances, since he doesn't play the usual tough guy you see him play in movies like Saturday Night Fever and Get Shorty. Instead, he plays a total wimp of a celebrity, and he pulls it off with flying colors. The underrated Bill Pullman has some funny moments in his supporting role. I was definitely impressed with Michael Moore, who's never had any acting experience before, yet it's not in any way visible in his very funny performance. Also in the supporting cast, we have Tim Roth, Ed O'Neill and Michael Rapaport--all giving first-rate performances. The movie is set in the 1980's, so I liked some of the cool 80's music in the soundtrack. Yet at the same time, Nora Ephron didn't try to capture the 80's atmosphere by having everyone where dorky 80's fashions and big hair and all that other stuff. Lucky Numbers is just a well-written film with a lot of great gags, and I would recommend this to anyone who's a fan of dark comedies.

Travolta is T.V. weatherman Russ Richards, something of a local celebrity in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where he also owns a snowmobile dealership.  Kudrow is Crystal Latroy, who works for the same station as Richards, as the `Vanna White' of the state lottery show; she's the girl who pulls the ping-pong balls from the tube and calls out the winning numbers.  In their world, everything is pretty much jake until the weather stays too good for too long; no snow means no snowmobile sales for Russ, and pretty quickly he's in it up to here, financially.  With his back against the wall, the usually honest and upright Richards is coaxed into a plan that will put an end to his woes and worries.  All he has to do is convince Crystal to help him rig the lottery, and they'll walk away with upward of six million dollars.  And, as it usually goes with a plan for the perfect crime, it isn't long before Murphy's Law goes into effect, and things go south in a hurry.  And life for Russ Richards, a guy with his own table at Denny's, just isn't what it used to be.  But, like they say, when things look dark, it's probably only going to get darker... 	For Travolta, the character of Richards is somewhat different than any he's done before.  To pull it off (which he does), he has to play down the charm and stifle his natural charisma, leaving Russ with just enough polish and ego to make him `local celebrity' believable.  This is a good guy at heart, reasonably intelligent, but not exactly the brightest bulb in the overheads.  And Travolta manages to put it all across admirably.  He's not someone you'll easily relate to, but you've got to like this guy.  He's kind of a, well, he's a goof-ball.  Kudrow has a character in Crystal that is different for her as well; as the lotto girl, on the show she exhibits a somewhat dense persona; but Crystal is anything but.  She's the sharp one of the bunch, externally charming when she needs to be, but tough as nails on the inside and ready to play hardball as soon as the opportunity presents itself.  And Kudrow plays it all beautifully.  Crystal is not someone you're readily going to embrace, but it's hard not to like her.  Is it her fault there's more than a little larceny in her heart just waiting for the right circumstances to be unleashed?   	Ephron seems to enjoy taking these characters, who are just a shade darker than what she's used to, through their paces.  It's a satirical walk on the wild side for her, and she manages to mine laughs in some of the darkest places along the way.  But when you have characters with names like `Gig' (Tim Roth) and `Dale the Thug' (Michael Rapaport), you're going to get some chuckles no matter what, especially when one of them is wielding a baseball bat for all the wrong reasons.     	The supporting cast includes Ed O'Neill (Dick), Michael Moore (Walter), Michael Weston (Larry), and, in a small, but highly effective and hilarious role, Bill Pullman (Lakewood).  This is a funny movie, though not uproariously so; things happen that you will laugh at in spite of yourself, while at other times there are moments that are genuinely side-splitting hilarious (one in particular, near the end, that involves an eighteen-wheeler).  This may not be Ephron's crowning achievement cinematically, but nevertheless, `Lucky Numbers' is entertaining and good for some laughs.  For Ephron, it's definitely the road less traveled; but in the end, it's a trip worth taking with her.  I rate this one 7/10.

This is the only film of Ephron's that I own. This retarded weatherman with a snowmobile business teams up with the world's deadliest TV lottery woman and tries to fix the lottery. The movie is held up, acting wise, by the great actor Tim Roth of Rob Roy fame. Ed O Neil is great as the TV manager who is way ahead of the world's stupidest criminals. Rappaport steals the movie as the goon who kills people with commemorative bats often quizzing them on the name of their favorite baseball player and re-enacting that player's stroke on his victims. It is all done with the seriousness of a comic book. I am not a fan of Kudrow but she is drop dead funny here. The most sociopathic hostile killer who is going to get that lifestyle she desires no matter who has to get rubbed out. Watch for Michael Moore as the patsy assigned to present the winning lottery ticket who makes the deadly error of trying to blackmail Kudrow. Travolta plays a clueless fop TV weatherman who has a reserved parking spot at the local Denny's. When his business is about to go belly up, Roth sends Rapporport, the world's most incompetent thug to rob the snowmobile store.One of the funniest scenes is Roth describing how the crime will be performed, with the scene visually done by Mission Impossible like precision, then watch how Dale The Thug actually does it, not quite as nicely. Travolta has the funniest scene where the pressure simply overwhelms him in the middle of a broadcast where he babbles incoherently then runs off the set in the middle of a news reading. Bill Pullman, of Independence Day, has a small role as a completely bored cop caught cheating on his disability and forced to investigate which goes nowhere. Kudrow is total hostility killing and betraying all through the movie. Yet, again, it is done so lightly, bloodlessly and the characters are such irredeemably moronic it is hilarious. What makes the movie work is how arrogant and snotty both Travolta and Kudrow are you will have zero sympathy for either of them. Roth is always correcting Travolta's brain dead criminal plans but hilariously Roth's plans are equally disastrous.I am not a big fan of anybody in this movie except Roth, an excellent actor, but I found it very light and amusing. Is it the best comedy ever made? No. Yet, it will make you laugh to watch these two morons completely come apart in their plans to become multi-millionaires by fixing the lottery on TV. Rappoport goes from genial, in his conversations, to batter up in ten seconds. The violence is all off screen except for a unseen blows off camera.

Neither is going anywhere.With the aid of their friend, Tim Roth, who manages a strip bar and restaurant, they concoct a scheme to win the lottery by distracting the Security Guard and injecting certain balls with a liquid that makes them heavier than others.Of course they can't present the winning ticket themselves. It might look funny. So they enlist the help of Kudrow's idiot cousin, Michael Moore, who dies of status asthmaticus at an awkward time. And, similarly, Tim Roth drags in some avaricious goons for some dirty work that later developments demand.It's a promising story, by Adam Resnik, and director Nora Ephron picks up the ball and runs with it. As comedy, this is about as black as it gets. It's a black comedy with characters adhering to nothing but hypothetical imperatives. What do I get out of it? There's nothing morally wrong with murder except that it leads to the inconvenient presence of dead bodies that must then be accounted for and disposed of.The dialog sparkles with cynical wit. Michael Moore is rapturous describing the joys of masturbation, while eying his cousin's breasts.Travolta is surprisingly good as the phony pitchman for snowmobiles and weather. And Kudrow is delicate and pretty in a quirky way. There's something bird-like about her long neck and darting glances, something that reminds one of an emu.Decent comedies rarely get the approval they deserve. Perhaps the comedy market is glutted with too much raunch that it not, in itself, funny. This one deserves applause.

Heck Girl, Interrupted had major parts of the movie filmed in Harrisburg, it was a decent film but you didn't know it was filmed there by any of the ads.  (Found out through IMDB).It was just a weak plot, I'd hate to say it was bad acting because there were so many good actors associated with the movie.  But as the old saying goes Garbage In, Garbage Out....doesn't matter how good the actor is if the script is horrible.So please, if you watch this movie, please don't pass judgement on those of us from (or formly from) Harrisburg.  No where is there any Denny's that has valet parking and preferred seating for it's weather folks, I think you have to drive to Reading to find the closest nudie bar and in general we're all pretty smart, well-educated folks.

Here he is a small TV station weatherman, adored by all the locals, and who also has a snowmobile dealership. The year is 1988 and the winter is unseasonably warm. No snowmobiles are being sold, and his home is about to be repossessed.  He needs money but his boss is refusing this time.  some SPOILERS FOLLOW - Small time numbers man (Tim Roth) suggests he stage a theft, and get the insurance money, That money is yours, they are using your insurance premiums and earning interest on it.  That fails miserably, he gets deeper in debt, this time to a burglar, and has to do something really desperate - rig the Pennsylvania lottery so he and his girlfriend (Kudrow) can split the $6.4Million, with the help of a masturbating and asthmatic cousin.  Enough of the details, the scam works, sort of, but the cousin dies, others want their cut, all this time Travolta's character is scared and upset that he would actually do these things. In the end everyone else gets killed or otherwise in trouble, he gets the extremely dumb waitress at Denny's, his favorite breakfast spot, to cash in the ticket and they move to warmer climate of Florida. Sometimes you just have to have a bit of Luck.This is the antithesis of all those Travolta movies (Face/Off, Broken Arrow, etc) where he plays the smart criminal who knows all the right moves, well almost all. Here he is not particularly bright, and is a very reluctant participant. I cannot say the movie is good, much of the dialog is haphazard, but it does entertain. With a smarter script, and in the hands of a different director, this premise could have been turned into a much better dark comedy on par with Analyze That or The Whole Nine Yards.  As it is, Lucky Numbers can entertain but its appropriate rating is around 5 or 6, about where the IMDb numbers are clustering now. The DVD is just OK, and the extras are not worth mentioning.

Lucky Numbers is not very funny. It could have been, but really is not. There are four or five funny sequences contained within the film's running time of almost two hours, and that is not enough to recommend on a comic level. But Lucky Numbers does everything else right, and director Nora Ephron captures an amusing sense of humor in her somewhat contentious production. That leads to a hard decision here-not enough laughs but an entertaining style and effective performances. I marginally recommend the movie as long as you do not expect to keel over in laugher while holding your sides in pain. 	The year is 1988. The film stars John Travolta as Russ Richards, a celebrity of a weather reporter in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. As the movie opens, we witness his egotistical attitude fed by hungry fans who surround him at his permanently reserved table at a local diner. He dreams of becoming a big time game show host and has the charisma to get the job, but his agent will not return his calls because, as we later find out, he is dead. Russ also has invested in a snowmobile dealership, but the extraordinarily mild winter has resulted in a lack of sales. Thus he is facing foreclose on his luxury house.  	Faced with zero opportunities and limited time, Russ gets ideas of how to get money quick from a sleazy strip club owner named Gig (Tim Roth). His first idea, an insurance scam, is a failure, so they soon turn to bigger possibilities. What better way to make fast cash then winning the lottery? The base lotto girl, Crystal (Lisa Kudrow from TV's Friends), whom with Russ and his Station manager, Dick (Ed O'Neill), are both having sex, is easily convinced to help him rig the lottery which will land them both in a jackpot of over six-million bucks. 	The heist works and Crystal and Russ have the winning ticket, but more characters become involved. Walter (documentary filmmaker Michael Moore), Crystal's asthmatic cousin, gets second ideas about helping the team with their scheme and wants a larger share of the money; being the middle man, is hard work, you know. A native bookie named Jerry (Richard Schiff) gets suspicious of Gig's behavior, and ends up at the bottom of a lake, courtesy of Gig's loyal hit man, the Thug (Michael Rapaport), who also becomes increasingly greedy. Lazy police Lt. Pat Lakewood (Bill Pullman, the president in Independence Day),  and his partner (Daryl Mitchell) also develop their suspicions with the lottery schemers, but Russ and Crystal's biggest problem may be Dick, who discovers the illegal scam and blackmails them two for half of the total amount of money. It appears rigging the lottery was not such a keen idea after all?	John Travolta and Lisa Kudrow do a good job of playing their characters straight and serious. There are some violent and morbid events that take place, and the actors effectively incorporate the necessary comic tone to make the material amusing instead of disturbing. They play characters who are active in a plot that, although uneven, flows smoothly and is well written. There are a few too many characters here, and the movie finds itself running out of elbow room near the end, but the story is still entertaining enough to hold out interest for the majority of the time.	Most of the laughs evolve from the characters' reactions to events taking place way out of their control. In one of the movie's funniest scenes, Russ is standing live before the camera when his associates announce on the news that the body of Jerry has been found. His reaction is to die for. Often the dialogue is even funnier. Take a scene where Walter is asked what he plans to do with his share of the money. In one breath he explains his church needs some heating equipment. In the next breath he declares the remainder of the earnings will help him open his own adult book store. During another scene, that owes a little too much of its tone to the inevitable Pulp Fiction, The Thug has a dispute that threatens Russ' life and reputation, but, as he walks away, sees a bottle of mouthwash Russ purchased. The following dialogue followsThe Thug Mint Listerine? Russ Yeah. The Thug When did they come out with this? Russ I dont know. The Thug Is it good? Russ Yeah, its good.The characters' moods make this one of the funniest scenes I have seen in a while-even though it may not read that way. 	Lucky Numbers is not a great comedy, nor it is a completely successful one. It does manage to possess an enjoyable tone, but often loses its focus and wonders off in so many directions, it's hard to keep up. Overall, the film is worth a watch just to see such a biting comic duo by Kudrow and Travolta-all the rest is extra credit.

After being one of the hottest properties in the eighties, he virtually disappeared for five years and then spent another four years with nothing more substantial than three `Look Who's Talking' movies.  Then at 40 years of age, he took an enormous gamble with `Pulp Fiction', making a triumphant comeback and never looking back.  Unfortunately, 2000 was not a good year for Travolta.  After the lackluster `Battlefield Earth', he needed a project that would help him regain his momentum.  This film wasn't it.`Lucky Numbers' is a dark comedy about two hapless employees of a local Harrisburg TV station who try to fix the state lottery.  The screenplay is goofy and has a TV sitcom feel to it.  The majority of the jokes don't work.  Director Nora Ephron (`Sleepless in Seattle', `Michael', `You've Got Mail') is a talented director, but quirky slapstick is not her strong suit.  She does much better with schmaltzy romantic projects.Travolta hasn't played a character this vacuous since Vinnie Barbarino in `Welcome Back, Kotter'.  It is a definite step backward for him, since he has proven himself an excellent dramatic actor.  His performance isn't terrible, the character is.  For Lisa Kudrow, this is the same ditzy character she has been playing for years, only with a liberal dose of profanity.  She does a good job, but the character is extremely predictable with little range.  Ed O'Neill is droll as the station manager who tries to cut himself in on the caper.This film has plenty of talent, but a weak script.  I rated it 5/10.

(Dir Nora Ephron)Weatherman never seem to get any proper respect and I'm sure you'll agree that whenever you click onto the local daily newscast with the award-winning team that when they finally get around to the announcement of their weatherman it is often with a false laugh and a couldn't-care-less disdain tone in their voices.  Like Steve Martin in `L.A. Story' and Bill Murray in `Groundhog Day', John Travolta plays a hapless forecaster with a yen to something better.The something for Russ Richards (Travolta), Harrisburg, PA's local celebrity weatherman, it is a desire to become a game show host by any means necessary (echoes of `To Die For') which leads him to shirk his big-fish-in-a-small pond status and his going nowhere snowmobile sales dealership that is floundering ironically due to unseasonably warm weather for the winter.  Russ, up to his neck in debt with a 30 day foreclosure on his house and his taste for a sporty Jag to tool around in to his private booth at the local Denny's (featuring the Russ Richards Omelette), conspires with his mistress Crystal (Kudrow, finally breaking away from her ditsy Emmy winning role as Phoebe on the sitcom blockbuster `Friends'), the lottery girl at the tv station, and his good buddy Gig (Roth) the proprietor of a strip club, to rig the state lottery with a surefire scheme to win the $6.4 M stake at hand. What follows is a domino effect of comedic errors that don't exactly provide guffaws or for me, even a smile.  The fact that the trio pull it off is a miracle in itself but when their not so ingenious plan backfires the daisy-chain of events builds up with no big payoff.  Characters are sloppily thrown in - Crystal's asthmatic, masturbating (thankfully off-screen) cousin Walter (rabble-rousing filmmaker Moore who provides some limited humor) is introduced as the dupe to cash in the winning claim ticket; Mitchell and Pullman as respectively an overzealous by-the-book rookie and slacker police team investigating the crime(s) at hand (Pullman seems to be doing a variation of his `stupidest man alive' character from `Ruthless People'); local bookie (Schiff, completely wasted in a pointed cameo); Rapaport cornering the cottage industry has set himself up for on another variation of mindless streetwise thugs as Dale The Thug (I'm not making that up either!) - while the threadebare plot by veteran comedy scribe Adam Resnick (including `The Larry Sanders Show' and Chris Elliott's cult sitcom classic `Get A Life') is staggeringly ill-conceived (based loosely on the real-life 1980 Pennsylvania Lottery fix) from the get go. Travolta, who has been in a string of flops for some time now since his Phoenix from the ashes revival in 1994's `Pulp Fiction', does what he can but his Russ is a one-dimensional character with shades of grey alluded to and all but force fed by the film's 180 degree turn at the end.  After all he did get his big break in comedy in the classic Seventies' sitcom `Welcome Back, Kotter' as the vacuous leader of the sweathogs, iconic Vinnie Barbarino which proved he could make people laugh effortlessly.  Here it's like watching him dance under water; gracelessly. Kudrow, who is an underrated comic actress (witness the indie hit `The Opposite Sex' for her bilious turn as a sexually frustrated schoolteacher surviving by her wits) and can act (ditto `Friends'), and even though she has shedded her alter ego of airheaded genius, her conniving Crystal is very unlikable and pretty ugly (which I suppose is the point). Filmmaker Ephron has had an equally unequal track record from her excellent screenplay of `When Harry Met Sally.' to her bomb directorial debut `Mixed Nuts' and the disastrous `Hanging Up' (co-starring Kudrow) this year as well, that maybe she should focus on one instead of both careers. The film overall feels half-baked and a hybrid of a crime drama and a black comedy ( I guess) of `A Simple Plan' and the aforementioned `Ruthless People' which only appears to be unlucky in the end run.

Okay, so it was suppose to be a comedy. It wasn't!  Killing several people, extortion and stealing reinforces the concept that crime pays. In the end all the perpetrators are shown enjoying their ill gotten gains and no one has to answer for the crimes that were committed.  As a sociatal statement it demonstrates what is so rotten with our American way of life today. Where are the good old days when Hollywood showed the good guys won and the criminals paid the price by going to prison?

'Lucky Numbers' isn't what it wants to be, but it's funny nonetheless. In order to make an official black comedy you have to start with a foundation in reality. From there you go a little off-center then you pull back to your realistic roots. You again go a little crazy later on, but just a little, then pull back again. In order for black comedy to be as humorously unsettling as it should be, it has to be handled by a professional; someone who knows what they're doing. M*A*S*H did it right, but Altman's a pro. Even Scorcese was slightly off with 'After Hours,' but it was pretty close. 'Very Bad Things' was a complete failure, but who's Peter Berg to try something so difficult?Nora Ephron, one of my favorite directors of the past ten years, has a great script with 'Lucky Numbers.' I hate the title, though. (Lately, it seems the people making movies name their projects the first thing that comes to mind.) A better title here would have been 'Balls.' This would be referring to Lisa Kudrow's character, though, and not John Travolta's. She is the strongest character here, and the best-looking, even though she's merely playing Phoebe yet again with some curse words thrown in. But Phoebe never said BL** ME! to her boss on 'Friends'. I wonder if the public would buy her in a more serious role a la 'The Opposite of Sex.' The supporting cast is underused, but great, especially Chris Kattan from SNL, playing Travolta's young wide-eyed protégé. His excerpts from his treatise on Evel Knievel are hilarious.This is a very appealing story that everyone who has ever wanted to win the lottery can enjoy. And who hasn't? For those paying attention, there are some great throw-away lines & asides and the look of the film is striking. For the life of me, though, I can't understand why this story takes place in 1988 instead of the here and now. Except for one Microsoft joke that was stolen from 'Forrest Gump' there is no reason turn the calendar back twelve years, unless it has something to do with the weather in Harrisburg, PA at the time. Oh well, even though it fails as a black comedy, it works as escapist comedy. Go see it and dream of walking away richer than before.

That said, I think it's an interesting story with some good laughs.  John Travolta and Lisa Kudrow are good (although you will be wishing Kudrow's character would meet a semi).Set in 1988, this story is about what happens to a popular weather man who rigs the state lottery with the help of his girlfriend who happens to be the lottery ball girl.  What's funny is watching how deep the characters get into trouble and how each attempt to get out of trouble gets them in even further.Although 100 different directors besides Nora Ephron could have done this movie better, it's not a bad recovery from Hanging Up.  And for Travolta, it should get him back in the good graces of those unfortunate souls who saw Battlefield Earth.

And he didn't disappoint Lucky Numbers is a piece of crap, not quite the kind of highly enjoyable garbage like that little intellectual exercise written by Elron Hubbard, but nevertheless trash of the highest order. Not to be enjoyed in any way, but marveled.1 the movie was utterly unfunny. 2 it was supposed to be a comedy. 1 + 2 = an embarrassment to all involved, to the viewer and to the maker of this crap.The plot is supposedly based on true events, yet so much in this movie smells of phoniness. It lacks realism. Besides, any film that has Michael Moore (a bad propaganda-movie maker and even worse actor and director) in its list of cast members can't have much chance of being quality stuff.Having realized after the first 10 minutes that this movie is going to be relentless in its pursuit of unfunniness, I was half-hoping that Travolta would once again introduce the concept of leverage into the plot. (Leverage was an essential tool used by aliens in B.E., riveting stuff, I assure you.) I thought maybe John's character could try to find out what Roth's character likes to eat and send him on a quest for rat - as happened in the afore-mentioned bomb.Forget his movies for a second if you can - and something tells me that LN is easy to forget (or at least advisable). The only thing I want to know now is how such a brilliant mind, such as Travolta undoubtedly has, can learn to fly an airplane? Is he an idiot savant? Or is learning to fly much easier than I thought? (MUCH easier.) Dear John, go back to your plans of making a sequel to your wonderfully inept Battlefield Earth saga. All us fans of that Edwoodsian mega-flop are praying (even though I'm an atheist!) that you make that follow-up stinker - and you promised you would!

This is one of those blacker-than-black comedies with a fairly downbeat tone.  It's not a laugh-out-loud comedy, there's no slapstick gags, but it doesn't try too hard and I think that's what makes it work most of the time.  This is a funny movie, don't get me wrong, you just won't be rolling in the aisles. I enjoyed the cast.  Lisa Kudrow is, naturally, a scene-stealer as the mean-spirited Lotto girl.  This is a change of pace for the actress who's usually typecasted as the blonde airhead.  And I liked the supporting performers like Michael Moore, Bill Pullman and Michael Rapaport. The plot is contrived, I'll admit that.  But as long as you can get past that, I think you will enjoy the film's offbeat acting and dark humor.  This is definitely not your usual Nora Ephron piece.  So, for those of you who are expecting Sleepless in Seattle or You've Got Mail--better pass on this one.  This movie has none of the sweetness of Ephron's standard work, and is quite the opposite.
