It is that wonderful combination of danger and romance that makes for great fantasy.  The chemistry between Kilmer and Shue holds this movie together.  It is a delight to watch them realize that their skin deep attraction goes much deeper.  If you can suspend your disbelief and just enjoy the ride, the Saint is a fun movie.  Despite its flaws, the Saint is a guilty pleasure to indulge in when your own life is lacking in explosions, gun fights, and sudden, passionate romances.

Not as The Saint but as an elaborate action movie with a twist. Val Kilmer bears nothing in him that even gets close to Roger Moore's character - but if you look away from that and try to see it as an ordinary film, it's really good.First of all, Val Kilmer performs fairly well, despite his weird accents. I really liked his artist type guy who seduces Emma Russell, he was great fun.As for the story, well...I didn't bother to check for anomalies, I knew I'd find plenty. I only have two more things to say1. Elisabeth Shue is absolutely stunningly beautiful in this film.2. The cool car that we only get to see a few seconds is a Volvo C70, a worthy replacement for the Volvo P1800 that Moore's Saint drove around in.

The story line itself is pretty impressive and I loved that although it keeps you guessing, you don't end up wondering, What the hell is going on?' The science side is played down enough for the audience to know it's there but not to get distracted by its details. I don't know if the theory actually works, but after watching the film I don't really care - that isn't the point of the movie.The thing that surprised me the most though was the leading female scientist, played by Elisabeth Shue. It's obvious from the start that she's going to be the 'love interest' but her characters personality always puts a question to the question, will they actually end up together. She's shy and nervous of people, but is incredibly open, honest and warmly lovable - an almost perfect contrast to Kilmer's Ã¼ber-suave, identity-confused, international thief-for-hire/spy. But that's the very thing that makes them ideal for each other, they might just be able to help each other with their character flaws and so you root for them both on a rather grand scale.I was vaguely baffled by the inclusion of random, suffering Russian civilians towards the latter half of the film, but considering that they were a film device to make the baddie look bad, the goodie look good and the 'common people trapped in the middle' look down right fantastic, they do their job rather well (apart from one woman who rats out our hero). All in all, they makes sure the audience are still caring if the common people are helped by the good guy, and hoping that the bad guy will eventually get his comeuppance. However, back to my original point. I still think that the film's main achievement is putting Val Kilmer in an interesting role that shows off just how good he can be; he's observant, yet unobservable; seductive, yet not a cad; confident but riddled with insecurities. Moreover, in the early stages of the film, British students are no longer misrepresented as drunken, whoring lay-abouts, but as attentive learners who actually show up for lectures. Impressive stuff.Yours Sincerely, A Proud British Student.

If you haven't seen it (as I hadn't until today), give it a try. It has action, suspense, romance, and a little comedy thrown in for good measure. It runs in at just about 2 hours long, so long enough to get a good plot, some twists & turns and yet not bore you.

From the small tube to the Silver Screen, our hero has arisen to a modern audience. With the superb talents of Val Kilmer, the saint is out to accomplish two goals. First he attempts to secure his life-long ambition of amassing $1 billion dollars, and second to perform three miracles. In the process, he encounters both friends and life threatening villains. In this episode, the Saint attempts to save the crumbling Soviet Empire' energy supply, by revamping the scientific and long sought-after formula of Cold Fusion. In this story, he helps brainy, Dr. Lev Botvin, (Henry Goodman) perfect the celebrated formula of Physist Emma Russell, (Elisabeth Shue). The re-energized formula will replenish Russia's dwindling energy and save the Premiere of Russia from the anti-government villains played adroitly by (Rade Serbedzija), Ivan Tretiak, (Valeri Nikolayev) and Vereshagin (Michael Byrne), the archenemies of Templar. Alun Armstrong is believable as Inspector Teal. The film is fast paced and action oriented with plenty of drama, guns, explosions and international intrigue. Kilmer is fantastic and I believe this will become a classic among all the great films of his career. **** "},{"Title":"SAINTLY,A CLEVER MOVIE!","Date":"1 December 2004","Score":"24 out of 37 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Romance","Review":" This movie is more of the modern day version of Robin Hood, only without the bow and arrows.

Of course they're acting, but I've never actually seen that moment when two people fall in love really portrayed in any other film I've seen. Its simply great writing when he is back in her apartment and he knows and feels its happening and tries to fight it but he cant. Then the scene cuts to her in the bathroom amazed at what she's feeling and saying This can't be happening! As corny as this sounds, the writing, the acting, the scene show the true power of love.Aside from that, Valeri Nikolayev who plays Tretiaks son is spot on with his acting. He's super intelligent and vicious. The perfect villain. I love it when he walks in the hotel, and his cronies shoot the clerk and he smells the rose in the vase. Beautiful acting, flawless writing and directing.There are some beautiful shots of Russia and England in this movie as well.

Not expecting similarity but hoping for some swashbuckling action in Simon Templar style, I was not disappointed. A thoroughly enjoyable Saturday evening viewing with a stylish Val Kilmer (an actor I'm not familiar with) who combined the Templar characteristics with James Bond finesse very well, and a cute Elizabeth Shue playing her part in the manner of the unlikely earlier Saint female leads (I've never seen a mini-skirted, sexy blonde scientific genius in all my years spent in Oxford!) but adding her own feisty zest to the proceedings.I particularly liked tongue-in-cheek references such as the repeat use of the first bars of the original Saint theme tune interrupting the background music, and the stick-pin Emma produces at the end which mimics the original Saint logo, and the voice of Roger Moore on the final voice-over car radio. I also liked the device of imagining a childhood background for Simon Templar. The original character (and I have read all the books) has a suitably hazy and enigmatic past of which his readers as well as the other characters (including his girlfriend Pat and sidekick Hoppy Uniatz) know nothing about. Adam Smith made an angelic young Simon and the orphanage setting was highly appropriate.Altogether an under-rated movie.

'The Saint' is a film without a complicated story, without (over)elaborated special FX, without super-special costumes or immense stages. Yet,  the result is very professional, and very positive. And 'The Saint' is one of those films that make you feel glad for the existence of Cinema. Val Kilmer, as Simon, and Elisabeth Shue, as Emma, give to their characters their very own souls. Despite the fact that 'The Saint' is basically an action film, the characters do not lack emotions, and do not appear lifeless. On the contrary, they're very human and realistic. And this is what makes the film so simple, yet so great. Feelings of happiness and sorrow, joy and depression, fear and courage, are mixed up-as in real life-in a story of adventure and romance, (with a lot of funny moments too) which captivates our total interest. As previously mentioned, special Fx or costumes, photography or art designing, are not an extraordinary aspect of the film. But that doesn't mean in any way, that a good job hasn't been done in these areas. What is a little more special and should be mentioned, is the very emotional music score, a perfect match for the film. In conclusion, it is safe to say that 'The Saint' is a film that very few won't enjoy. The Saint is a great film for those we seek two hours of action, feelings and joyful smiles.

He is a master of disguise and this ability prevents even those who will hire him from knowing his true identity. In fact he is only reachable through a veil of phone and internet contacts. He has one last job that will get him to his retirement goal. Of course, this last job will be a doozie and have him choosing between his professionalism to complete the job or to side with his newfound love interest and follow his heart to what could be his true soulmate for his life to come.Val Kilmer is The Saint, the thief, and at his best in a character you can't help but love. All the disguises are brilliant and you truly get inside this character as the story evolves. Elizabeth Shue is the scientist, the love interest here and does a wonderful job as well, while Kilmer works his magic upon her to steal the scientific secret that only she knows. Their personalities and souls gel as The Saint's mission goes on and they get trapped within a Russian mafia plan that would have them both killed. Kilmer's pursuit of Shue's secret, their mutual escape attempts and the bond they make for a possible future bring the audience into a wonderful and exciting story of a lonely man's discovery of love lost many years ago.This movie has fabulous writing, plot line, acting, scenery, technology, action, camera-work, etc. You name it, it was done well.

The cunning rogue and the eccentric beauty are very, very, very well done here.Val Kilmer gives a very convincing performance and succeeds in playing a very deep yet very playful and adventurous loner. He has more than the usual machismo a leading rogue requires. He has flair and the sense of passion that a true appreciator of people might have. After all, he enjoys certain freedoms from what most people would consider normal, average life and this gives him the edge of the outsider looking in. An observer, if you will. He is able to play Emma (and us, the audience)because he is both a damn fine professional and loves his line of work all at the same time. That is power (and the gadgets don't' hurt either)Elizabeth Shue captures the eccentric, innocent yet unmistakably keen and observant scientist. She feels and displays passion at levels we would love to feel. She let's us see her feelings so we know she's in love. Her expressions give authenticity to the attraction between her and Simon and this makes the movie more than just a caper flick.As a whole, the movie is well-paced, well shot and well acted. The plot weaves into itself with the right thread of natural feelings of cleverness and connection. The ending is perfect and the ride is memorable.~Jared "},{"Title":"Very Good!

In some reviews, it has even been likened to The Avengers as one of the most misguided movies of all-time. However, I genuinely cannot see why this film has aroused so much dismay among the cinema going public. As far as I'm concerned, this is an accomplished, rousing and satisfyingly complex espionage thriller.The plot finds a master of disguise/super-thief, Simon Templar (Kilmer), being hired to track down and steal a brilliant energy-saving formula. The formula was invented by a female science student at Oxford University (Shue), and when Templar eventually closes in on her, he finds himself falling in love with her. Oh yes, then there's the small problem of the swarm of Russian agents who also want the formula....Kilmer is OK as Templar, but the character was better portrayed in previous incarnations by Ian Ogilvy and Roger Moore. Shue, as the science whiz, is stunningly attractive and actually manages to just about get away with the fact that she is essentially miscast. The action scenes in the film are well done, but this is no surprise since the director Phillip Noyce is a dab hand at this kind of thing thanks to his work on a couple of the Jack Ryan movies, not to mention the unbearably taut Dead Calm.If you've never seen The Saint, I would encourage you to do so. If you've intentionally avoided the film because of the negative reviews you may have read, ignore them! This is huge fun!

All I know is that it starred Roger Moore (an actor who, like Kilmer, is unlikely to be troubled by the Academy) and had a vaguely-memorable theme tune. Then it came back with Ian Ogilvy, who was less popular, but had a cracking theme under the name of Return of the Saint. Oh, and he wears a little stick-figure Saint icon, which is oddly effeminate with it's one hand on hip, the other tilted. A bit of a fey emblem for one so suave.Other than that, I came to this film afresh. I'm not normally Val's biggest fan (feeling he virtually slid off the screen in apathy during Batman Forever) and only tuned in to see a real lousy movie, an enjoyable pastime on occasion. However, while Val may be a charisma-free zone on a par with Keanu, I think in The Saint he does seem to be enjoying himself a lot more. In fact, in a more personable actor, this film could have easily become a one-liner spouting, smug action film. With the more... er... dormant, shall we say?... performance of Kilmer, it has a less abrasive edge.The plot, acting and dialogue probably won't stand up to close inspection, but then this isn't the sort of film you're going to watch more than once. It's passable entertainment, where Kilmer adopts a variety of ludicrous disguises and even more ludicrous accents to foil some Russians in a cold fusion war.Val's characterisation is interesting, as is the role itself. I mean, what is The Saint, other than a glorified thief? Only British tv could come up with such an anti-hero; a leading man who basically... nicks things. Even towards the end, when a more philanthropic nature is revealed, this is still a man with $50 million in the bank, and yet no-one yells you dirty crook and all the women want to bed him. I liked the fact that a lot of it was set in England, something you don't often get in Hollywood films. Best bit in this country had to be the English police tackling an armed man. Stop, sir, hold it right there says the unarmed policewoman. A nice culture clash.I'm not trying to justify this as a classic, and neither is it rocket science. (Well, actually, having said that, rocket science IS one of its plot elements...) All I'm saying is that this picture was an enjoyable, passable way to spend an hour and fifty minutes, a nice piece of escapist fluff that harms no one.

Kilmer is the perfect choice to play Simon Templar, master thief who is also a master of disguise and charmer of women. The different characters Kilmer creates while in disguise are interesting, believable and amusing.Templar is a modern day Robin Hood. He uses his charm, technological skills, and cunning to steal from evil entities. He then gives some of his loot to charitable organizations, but keeps a significant amount for himself. He prefers not to use guns and violence, but trickery to elude his foes. He also is just as adept at James Bond in seducing women to help achieve his goals.Fans of The Saint TV show who prefer Templar as an independently wealthy detective may not like this adaptation. I personally enjoy the TV series, but I believe that this Saint more closely resembles the character Leslie Charteris had in mind when he wrote his novels and stories. There is more dimension to Kilmer's Simon Templar than we have ever seen.The movie nicely shows the versatility of Kilmer's acting ability. I would love to see a sequel at some point, but Kilmer is getting old for the part. If you like the espionage genre, this film is worth a look.

Simon Templar (Val Kilmer) is a big time con-artist/thief who operates to further his own financial position, charm some very attractive ladies and buy himself a Volvo that actually looks good. An ambitious Russian oil magnate hires him to steal a formula off a gorgeous nuclear physicist. They fall in love and Templar turns from thief into hero. I don't think this movie claims to be anything life-changing but it's good fun if taken lightly. Kilmer has a good turn as Templar and his various disguises and pranks along with some bungling by a few hapless Scotland Yard detectives provide a few laughs. The action is great fun and backed by the Chemical Brothers and Underworld. The romance between Elisabeth Shue's character and Kilmer's isn't bad either, they're both convincing in their own way and there are some nice moments for sentimental folk like me. The Saint is perfect for a quiet night with the boys, beers and some gawking at Elisabeth Shue, it's bad not to watch with that someone special either.CheersTim  "},{"Title":"Cloak-and-Dagger espionage gets lift from Val Kilmer's clever performance...","Date":"18 May 2001","Score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Romance","Review":"  If you expect 'The Saint' to resemble the TV series with Roger Moore, or going further back, the films with George Sanders or Tom Conway, you're in for a disappointment.

Plenty of action thrills along the way as The Saint manages to outwit and outsmart the villains at every turn. Seems he's needed to infiltrate a top-secret organization bent on stealing a scientific formula that could change the world.

The Russians are also brilliant as criminals becoming desperate near the end after they have been so ruthless and powerful all of the way through.

Her character is so tender that we understand why The Saint, a highly cold and professional spy, falls in love with her. I always admired the films of Phillip Noyce, and although The Saint is an example of his capacity to deliver a good motion picture, his best work is Dead Calm, the 1989 thriller starred by Billy Zane, Nicole Kidman and Sam Neill. It's obvious that, after Dead Calm gained terrific reviews, Hollywood discovered this talented Australian filmmaker. The Saint has all the elements that sustain the entertainment - action,romance and suspense. The guy who plays the villain (Rade something, I don't remember his last name) is also great, and when he is on the screen, he steals the scene from the protagonist.

The way I see The Saint is much the way George Sanders and Louis Hayward interpreted him. A debonair scourge of spies and criminals, The Saint steps in where the official police are afraid to tread or unable to investigate. Now there is nothing debonair about Val Kilmer. Nothing particularly likable either -- except for the fact that he bests the villains and can run fast. I don't blame the heroine for being confused, for The Saint himself -- as presented here -- is a confusing character. The script even takes time out to let us know WHY he is confused. It all happened in his childhood, see, when he was a victimized Oliver Twist in an orphanage -- but not just an ordinary orphanage. As I pointed out in other reviews, many modern movies are determined to throw off the shackles of the past and come out fighting mad. In this case, it's the Catholic Church that gets a firm drubbing with a sadistic priest presented as a fiend from hell. These childhood episodes really have little to do with the main action but are presented mainly for their shock value. The film, which is a mite too long at 112 minutes away, would be better off without them.

Only a few Saint items elude me. The very hard to find Simon Dutton Saint adventures from the late 80's, the Andrew Clarke one off TV Movie from 1987, the old radio shows from he 40's and 50's and the forgettable French movies of the 60's.Because of this, I was very wary about the Val Kilmer movie featuring the halo'd character of Simon Templar despite having Saint legend Robert S. Baker as executive producer. My fears were not without foundation.The character of Simon Templar as originally written by creator Leslie Charteris is an English Gentleman adventurer thief, he is known by reputation as a criminal with morals. He despises injustice, never preys on the innocent and only steals from people he refers to as the ungodly who have made their ill gotten gains by riding rough shod over anyone and everything. In this movie we have an American Templar (1st mistake), who commits high tech robberies for extremely large sums on behalf of people who are morally bankrupt (2nd mistake). In fact Kilmer's portrayal of Simon Templar is as far removed from Charteris's creation and the character portrayed so well by Moore, Ogilvy and Sanders you cannot even recognise him as being the same person.Having said that it was SO easy to forget that this was even a Saint movie. As far as I'm concerned it was just a wonderful exciting movie about an American cyber criminal on the run from the Russian Mafia who falls in love with an American physicist. The action is gripping the plot engaging and the acting superb, apart from a few VERY sickly scenes between Kilmer and Shue. I'm all for romance between characters but......I did enjoy it but apart from the title it is in no way, shape or form, a Saint Movie. That was the producers 3rd and biggest mistake. By calling it a Saint movie, they were already on the back foot as expectations were no doubt going to be high especially from die hard Saint fans like myself. Making the Saint an American is a BIG no no. having the Saint happily work for criminals is another.If they had removed all reference to The Saint character from the story, I could be easily reviewing one of the best movies of the '90's. Kilmer's Character was more akin to Ethan Hunt than anything you would ever find in a Charteris book. However, Elizabeth Shue is GORGEOUS and I really did enjoy this movie very much for what it was. If you can forget it's a supposed to be a Saint movie then I'm sure you will too.Enjoy!!!

At his side is a sexy but fragile electro-chemist played by Elizabeth Shue, who hopes to keep the secrets of cold fusion out of the hands evil oil baron, Ivan Treitiak.Yeah, it's silly, but Noyce elevates the material, keeps the pace up, serves up some nice location photography and seems to have learnt well from Alfred Hitchcock, who practically invented such running man movies, in which the film's entire plot is an excuse for thrills, pretty scenery and the promise of a kiss.As the spy genre (popularised on screen in the 30s by guys like Hitch, Michael Curtiz and Carol Reed, but started by Fritz Lang in 1928 with Spies) was virtually birthed from the clashes between the British Secret Service and German Intelligence, The Saint, like most spy movies, has fun playing with European landscapes and old school spy trinkets/conventions. 7.9/10 &#x96; Worth one viewing.

Even more indomitable for Simon, he finds himself falling for the woman he's been hired to hoodwink.What this is, in essence, is a dumbed down, romanced-up prequel to the Saint in that it features Simon Templar before he became an heroic character. That said, this character as portrayed by Kilmer bears very little resemblance to Leslie Charteris's Saint. And if you're expecting similarity to the Roger Moore version of the Saint, you'll be even more disappointed. Kilmer was miscast here no doubt about it. The Saint is supposed to be a charming rogue whereas Kilmer's version is basically a romantic master of disguise who's running from himself. The charm sadly is missing. Kilmer is completely unconvincing as a womanizer and not once did I believe he ever really had the upper hand in his relationship with Dr. Emma Russell which certainly doesn't fit the classic character. Still in terms of romance, this delivers the goods and then some. Only problem is The Saint isn't supposed to be a romance movie. Still anyone who likes watching attractive people, certainly hard to beat the leads here, fall in love may very well find plenty to enjoy here.

The rest often turn out to be unqualified disasters. The Avengers or Wild Wild West anyone? Philip `Dead Calm' Noyce helmed this effort starring Val Kilmer as the man with the halo and while its not quite the travesty that many critics claimed, it's still a poor adaptation of the &#145;60s TV series based on the books by Leslie Charteris.  Kilmer's Simon Templar bears little resemblance to either. The scriptwriters have attempted to re-invent him as a Bond type hero with a troubled past and have injected the concept of him being a master of disguise. Sadly this doesn't work at all. Kilmer's stints under various makeup jobs are at first amusing in a pantomime way, but soon become tiresome, mainly because he is really a ham actor impersonating racial and social stereotypes rather than a master of disguise. The plot has our hero goes globe trotting in his attempts to steal a formula to create free energy for an evil Russian megalomaniac, from unworldly researcher Elizabeth Shue. All of this is featherweight in the extreme and doesn't make much sense anyway. To make matters worse, all Noyce seems to be doing is pointing the camera at the actors with minimal interest or conviction and for an action flick this is surprisingly dull. A few more action set pieces would have been welcome. Shue as the innocent scientist with a heart condition is easily the film's best asset. Looking perfectly lovely, she gives a performance of naÃ¯ve charm, without ever turning into a run-of-mill annoying love interest, however unlikely a cold fusion expert she may be. Nevertheless there's nothing here that saves the film and any episode of the Roger Moore TV series is far more more entertaining that this mess.

When a movie tips to the ludicrous side of my suspension of disbelief scale, it's time to flush it. The scriptwriters of this piece of trash believed that the audience would eat any illogical, brain-numbing plot devices they could conjure up.Movies often turn to the illogical plot device to help get the story somewhere more interesting. I don't fault them for that. A small plot hole in exchange for transporting us somewhere interesting is a small price to pay. For instance, it's difficult but I'm willing to believe that a moody, 30 year old blonde is an accomplished physicist. Shue's bio says that she did go to Harvard, though she sure didn't win any award for oratory. Anyway, moving on, I'll even believe that Val Kilmer is able to change his elaborate disguises in seconds, unassisted. My stomach is growling, but I'm ready to watch the film. Then, they throw in cold fusion. Fine. Cold fusion is a valid plot device these days. My stomach is ready to hurl, but if the story is good, I'll survive.But no, the scriptwriter dwells on the illogical and makes it the centerpiece of the movie. Cold Fusion this, cold fusion that. Yada yada yada. At one point, we're somehow expected to believe that an angry mob of 100,000 freezing Muscovites interpret (let alone see) a fusion-powered lightbulb to mean that, although they will still be cold and hungry for the foreseeable future, the Russian government deserves their support.Most of the other comments on this film are positive.

Iceman in Top Gun and playing a second-rate Batman compared to Michael Keaton. But I was proved wrong in The Saint, which pushes acting to the limit with Kilmer playing a variety of characters very well, and also having romantic and action scenes.The Saint features Simon Templar, aka The Human Fly (Kilmer), who travels the world in disguise to steal and sell whatever he can for the highest price. Things become more complicated when he must steal from a beautiful physicist (Elisabeth Shue).I thought Shue was especially flaky, as was her character. How a beautiful woman who knows cold fusion does not get a date is beyond me. Also, how a world-famous physicist can dress and act like a high school cheerleader is also a bit odd. But I guess it's possible. On a related note, this is Shue's most beautiful appearance. I cannot even recognize her as the girl next door of Adventures in Babysitting or The Karate Kid.I'm also not sure if the best way to cure hypothermia is to take off all your clothes, because that is not what I learned in Boy Scouts. But I'm not a physicist.Otherwise, great film. The costume and makeup department deserved an Oscar. If they didn't get one, I scream foul because I have never seen more convincing makeup and hair extensions in a film before. Kilmer was able to play roughly six characters that were all lifelike and quite distinguishable.The fights were great, especially when Kilmer donned his ninja gear and fought the Russian mafia. Breathtaking. And what a great choice to play the Russian villain. Charismatic, strong actor and powerfully menacing.This almost makes me want to see the original TV series, though I think I'd be disappointed.

The original Simon Templar was far too self-assured to have had the miserable childhood depicted. He may have become an orphan and he may have gone to a school in the Far East, but he clearly had a decent, not unhappy education. It wasn't until I watched the commentary by the Director that I discovered this movie was meant to be a prequel to the Saint stories of Leslie Charteris. So it must take place before Meet the Tiger in which The Saint is 26 in England in about 1928. However, the plot relates to 1997 period and cold fusion!!! (There was a fuss about cold fusion not so long before when some scientist(s) said had discovered how to do it but this couldn't be replicated. Choosing cold fusion for a topic was painfully dated in hindsight and extremely dodgy.) This timeline confusion has been done again recently with the Bond movie Casino Royale, also a messy and badly scripted plot with an actor who doesn't look, act or convince as Bond. Templar was handsome, dashing, and charismatic. Kilmer's looks just aren't right. Forget he's the Saint and he improves immediately - interesting personality of his own and works well with the attractive heroine. The plot of The Saint is daft because it just isn't the kind of things Templar would ever do. It's a movie that's difficult to watch because of the contrast between Roger Moore and the seriously miscast Kilmer who even has an American bowery-type accent when being himself yet the Saint is English. It would have been better if the director hadn't had some obsession with putting over his own pet idea of the Saint's early life, but instead considered what would fit in with the Charteris stories. It was amazing to discover from his commentary that he was a fan of the Saint books and knew them well. You would never know it from the movie. You'd think he'd never read a Saint book nor seen a Roger Moore Saint episode. But better still if the story had been based on the early books which form something of a serial - The Last Hero, The Avenging Saint and Getaway, my three favourites of all the books and I think by far the best - nothing Charteris wrote later for me ever lived up to these early stories. They had all the 30's charm and the movie could have been fashionably period, there was the tragedy of Norman Kent to pull at the heart strings (just compare it with the tedious romance in Kilmer's film tho' the actors did their best admittedly), and the entertaining story that starts in Germany - Getaway - to give a European setting. This would have been a splendid Meet the Saint. The romance should have been as that in the books - Patricia Holm, to please her many fans. The best part of the movie is the ending - Roger Moore's voice is a delight. There's the Saint logo. There are hints of the music from the TV series. But how this story might have worked would have been to make it a Bond movie. With a better scriptwriter to sort out the anomalies and a suitable actor for Bond.

Everybody knows (or at least, they should) that it was the Brits who recovered the German Enigma code-deciphering machine during the Second World War. Not that viewers of U-571 would know, of course, where the Enigma machine is found by Jon Bon Jovi and Harvey Keitel. The less said about the U.S. remakes of The Italian Job and The Avengers, the better and sadly, the trend continues with The Saint where a half-forgotten TV character from the Sixties is brought back to life and promptly crapped on.Val Kilmer takes the unlikely role of Simon Templar, an English public-schoolboy who grows up to be an international thief and mercenary for hire. He needs to take on one last job before he can retire and thus, he finds himself working for Russian politician Ivan Tretiak (Rade Serbedzija) and must recover a scientific formula for some energy thing called Cold Fusion. Leaping into action, Simon traces the theory back to beautiful Dr. Emma Russell (Elizabeth Shue) and before you can say conflict of interest, Simon falls for her and begins to protect her from the Russians who will stop at nothing to steal the formula for themselves.Before I start on the movie itself, allow me to revisit the point I made at the beginning. In the TV show, Templar is a gentleman thief and helps people with their problems for the Hell of it. He is not a gun-for-hire mercenary as he is here, obsessed with his bank balance instead of righting wrongs and making the world a better place out of the goodness of his heart. In short, this is The Saint in name only - it bears as much relation to the original show as I do to Brad Pitt (i.e. none). Kilmer is just dreadful, displaying all the grace and charm of a worm on a fish-hook. Disguises merely consist of differing amounts of fake facial hair and appalling accents and if spying is that easy then sign me up! There is little chemistry between Kilmer and Shue and neither are helped by the convoluted plot which seems determined to lose and confuse you at every opportunity. When you're not laughing at Kilmer, the action sequences are not too bad but again, this goes against the whole principal of the character. This could have been any film, with any character but instead of being an alright spy thriller, they attach the story to a character that simply doesn't belong there. It's a bit like making a romantic comedy with Hannibal Lecter as the principal lead.So where does this leave The Saint? It certainly belongs in the increasingly large pile of second-rate remakes along with Italian Job, Avengers, Dukes Of Hazzard and others. It's not even a good example of a spy film - stick with something like The Bourne Identity which does deviate from the source material but not in such a way as to disrupt the plausibility of the lead character or your enjoyment of the movie as a whole. I'm sorry but this film appears to have been massively over-rated on this website. Kilmer deserved his Razzie nomination - I felt like I was watching a feature-length episode of Allo, Allo but with more money spent on pyrotechnics. In all honesty, I cannot recommend this film to anybody. Perhaps those with no knowledge of the original might get something out of watching this but I mean no knowledge at all, whatsoever, not even the theme music!

Roger Moore's method of acting may be just to raise and lower his eyebrows but he did a better job than anyone in this film.Two and a half hours out of my life. Wasted.

It might even be a cult classic by now.Val Kilmer is a 'gentleman thief' known internationally as The Saint but going by the name Simon Templar. Simon uses the names of Catholic Saints for aliases in his varied disguises. He grew up in an abusive Catholic orphanage and took the alias Simon Templar while there. After a childhood crush's accidental death he fled the orphanage and became a thief specializing in industrial espionage.He's become wealthy this way and is hired by a ruthless Russian industrialist called Ivan Tretiak (Rade Serbedzija) to steal a cold fusion formula from Dr. Emma Russell (Elisabeth Shue) in order to help the Russian gain a monopoly on the energy market and assist his plot to overthrow the Russian government in the wake of an oil shortage. Simon steals the formula from Emma but it's incomplete and therefore useless to Tretiak so he tries to have Simon assassinated and Emma kidnapped.Simon must help Emma complete her formula and protects both their lives in various stupid disguises and accents which are howlingly bad on Kilmer's part since the best guise he can affect is an effeminate seeming soft-spoken white South African artist that gets him into Emma's bed. The stock villain Tretiak and his junkie son are your typical out to rule the world at any cost bad guys.The funniest scene in the movie occurs when Val Kilmer's Saint invades Tretiak's nightclub office dressed as the villain and forces him at knife point to transfer The Saint's payment into a bank account. He leaves the office and tells Tretiak's bodyguards there's an impostor behind him managing to get away in the confusion that follows. Watching this in a theater when I was 15 was a chore and one of two times I fell asleep watching a movie I paid to see.

Not your first choice as a neighbor, but great fun to watch on the big screen! He demonstrates his fine range in 'The Saint', an able impersonator of several characters, a pre-cursor to the 'Jason Bourne' sort of super-hero who is resourceful, but also somewhat damaged. (Kilmer also shone in The Ghost and the Darkness as an engineer in Kenya, and, yes, I'm the only on the planet who liked his work in 'Batman 3' -- you see as a person, he's as dark as the character he plays, so, it works for me!)I'm old enough to remember the TV series -- the stories were a bit far-fetched, good entertainment, but not to be taken too seriously. Roger Moore could do no wrong -- every plot he hatched to outwit the bad guys worked to perfection. The breaks the Saint gets in this movie are also fortuitous, to be sure, but I view that as a sort of tribute to the original show - don't start picking the 'realism' apart, for goodness sakes! Nor are comparisons to the original Leslie Charteris' character particularly helpful - several actors gave us that, thanks -- let's move on.For that matter, consider the setting Russia in the midst of an energy crisis with a rich, power-hungry oligarch named 'Tretiak' (ably played by Rade Serbedzija) plotting to initialize a coup to grab political control -- in fact, the screenplay was somewhat visionary seeing that the flick was made in 1997 and Putin has reportedly just 'taken down' the Oligarchs who were bankrupting the new Russia. Tretiak also uses the Russian mob and compromised paramilitary police forces to do his bidding. Life imitates art. (suggested read 'Icon' by Frederick Forsyth).Elisabeth Shue shines as the naive researcher who gets entangled with Kilmer. Supporting roles were also terrific, especially by Valery Nikolaev as Tretiak's cold-as-ice son, a worthy adversary for our Saint, and Alun Armstrong as a cop haplessly on the trail of our hero (Armstrong has been around forever and has always looked the same age -- you will catch him as an army leader 'Mornay' in 'Braveheart', and more recently as a lovable but fragile, eccentric detective in the British series 'New Tricks').Music and camera-work are also impressive. Personally, I love the Russian settings - it's a culture exotic and mysterious, but damaged, and -- not unlike the Protagonist of our story -- rooted in ancient traditions.Finally, Amazon has the DVD for sale at a great price, but if you're really hankering for the original 'Roger Moore' series (or curious), there is box set of those available also.8 out of ten "},{"Title":"if the backgroud is a tail fairy tale story, i believe it. but","Date":"26 January 2004","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Romance","Review":"  if the backgroud is a tail fairy tale story, i believe it. but it's real world, this guy can't do the things by himself.

This is one of those movies. Someone did a lot of research on the whole script, writing it I mean. But, then what do the director and editing assistants do? They muck the whole thing up by putting cheesy titles, and information on the screen that no one wants to see. Extra information, but more than that just cheesy stuff that you would see in a bad 'B' movie.Val Kilmer was a great choice for the role that he played. It just shows how good a character actor he can actually be and still play the handsome love-interest.But, I was most impressed with Elisabeth Shue's performance. She really holds her own in this piece. Granted, I am a big Shue fan, but I would have to say that this is one of her better roles. I think even better than 'Leaving Las Vegas' which is a much different film, I know, but still, she has a very powerful way in this film of delivering her character's nervousness, and naivitivity.The directing was minimal at best and I frankly didn't think that the bad guys were all that bad. I think even as a lighter drama, this could have been such a better movie than it turned out.However, it is quite entertaining and one of the only films I actually like Val Kilmer in.

The beginning didn't totally make sense to me, however Simon (Val Kilmer) had a bad experience in a Catholic orphanage, escaped with his clever use of his bag of tricks, and as an adult became a thief using a number of different saint names, thus the title of the film. His love interest is Emma (Elisabeth Shue), a PhD with the correct formula for cold fusion, but also with a heart condition requiring medication.The evil Tretiak (Rade Serbedzija) plots to depose the Russian president by creating an artificial heating oil crisis, and having him spend lots of money on a cold fusion formula, stolen by Simon, that doesn't work. Simon turns the tables on him, with Emma's scientific help, and the cold fusion does work, and Tretiak is exposed for the criminal he is, Simon and Emma end up together.There is a modest amount of good action, and in a real 'cool' scene, after Simon hides under freezing water, Emma has to strip off his clothes, and hers, and gets on top of him to warm him up! Kilmer and Shue are easy to look at, and act well.  As good as most 'fluff' movies, but nothing memorable.  Except -- cold fusion DOESN'T WORK, in case anyone is still unsure.

Val Kilmer plays Simon Templar, a mysterious, slippery international thief who takes dangerous employ from anyone willing to pay a night, discreet price for his unique talents. He also uses an elaborate range of disguises, with alias names coined by the Catholic saints. He is hired by a shadowy Russian billionaire (Rade Serbedzija) to steal the formula for a cold fusion device from a beautiful scientist (Elizabeth Shue). Naturally he falls in love with her and they end up on the run from the billionaire, his forces, MI6 and everyone in between. It's not a heavy hitting action romp like it sounds, but more of an atmospheric, romantic, theatrically inclined bit of intrigue, and a whole lot of slow burning fun. Much of the action takes place in gorgeous, picturesque Moscow, giving it a lovely, old world, almost John Le Carre esque feel. Kilmer is awesome, underplaying every disguise and clearly having a lot of fun, his own Templar identity a moody mix of guilt and passion. Shue takes the gorgeous scientist clichÃ© and spins it for a believable, humbled character which works excellently. There's cool work from Alun Armstrong, Valery Nikolaev, and a cameo from Emily Mortimer as well. For fans of spy adventure flicks with a globetrotting, master of disguise sense of adventure, this one spins a tale worth tuning into.

This film does not live up to the style of the books or the TV incarnation, and that may be part of the reason for its low rating. As a stand-alone action spy thriller, it's quite entertaining, with the obligatory plot holes pulling it down from a really high score, but fun to watch nonetheless.Val Kilmer plays The Saint, who witnessed the death of another youngster at a cruel religious orphanage when he escaped. Two decades later, The Saint is an internationally active go-to man for difficult jobs, like stealing a microchip from a Russian industrial magnate. That he does, and soon the plot evolves into a chase for a cold fusion formula. The formula was only half worked out by smart and beautiful physicist Emma (Elizabeth Shue) when Kilmer steals it. The film then takes some improbable turns to get the main characters near the clutches of the evil industrial magnate, who wants to use the non-functional formula to discredit Russia's elected president during an energy crisis. At the last minute, with the aid of a Russian scientist, the good guys get the formula to work, and in the epilogue The Saint manages yet again to evade British police.The Saint evades everyone with elaborate disguises, which make the movie fun to watch. Kilmer demonstrated that he can really act, although he's not quite a Peter Sellers when it comes to playing a bundle of different characters. The chemistry (or should I say, physics) between Shue and Kilmer is great, so the romantic entanglements in this action thriller also hold up.The movie well reflects the hopes for dÃ©tente and democratization in Russia held in the West in the 90s, and now soundly dashed by the interminable Putkin regime. The energy crisis theme rings truer and truer with passing years.Occasionally the film moves slowly, and there are unnecessary plot holes that could have been fixed quite easily with better scripting, but none of these minor problems detract from the jolly good 100 minutes of fun that The Saint brings to the screen. I've seen it a couple of times, and like good James Bond flicks (Thunderball et al.), it can be enjoyed more than once.

It has very little resemblance to the Simon Templar that we got to know in the TV-series starring Roger Moore in the lead role. I have not read the books so I do not know how well the movie actually relates to the books but I have to say that I was a little disappointed to see a Simon Templar that was not really&#x85;him.I have never really been a huge fan of Val Kilmer and I do not really think he is the best match for the role. But then, as I wrote, I really do not see this as a Simon Templar movie anyway so. Elisabeth Shue is totally unbelievable as a scientist. I know they had to pick someone reasonably good-looking to satisfy the script but still, she just doesn't cut it as a scientist. The Russians are giving a much better performance. I quite liked both the Tretiak characters.That is not to say that this is a bad movie though. You just have to forget about the references to The Saint and Simon Templar. The latter is not very difficult since he really do not call himself Simon Templar in most of the movie anyway. What this movie is though is a fairly decent light entertainment about a skilled high stakes thief with a troubled childhood. I say light entertainment because the plot is really not much more than you would expect from a TV-series pilot. There are some fun action, some fun infiltration, disguises, a bit of high-tech etc. Just a mixture of some fun stuff making you go okay that was not too bad at the end of the movie.Oh, one more thing, I know that Simon Templar used to drive a Volvo P1800 but quite frankly, that was the only cool car that Volvo have ever made. Since the movie was so far from what I consider to be Simon Templar it is a real bummer that they had to choose that modern Volvo crap for him to drive.

The Saint had a series of short films in the 1940s however made it big when Roger Moore portrayed him for a television series in the 1960s that became an international hit.In this big budget film starring Val Kilmer we have an attempt to re- invent the character. As a homage to Charteris we have scenes of him as a boy in a Catholic boarding school in the Far East. In the present day he is a criminal for hire who steals secrets and formulas and uses aliases that are Catholic Saints and is a master of disguise.The Saint is hired by a Russian businessman and aspiring politician to get a secret cold fusion formula from a young scientist played by Elisabeth Shue. You never for a moment buy Shue as a brilliant scientist and Kilmer falls for her and finds out that he needs to outwit the Russians and save the Russian Premiere as well as saving Shue. The story is all over the place and Shue's gut feeling that her formula is right without any scientific basis is laughable. There is good chemistry between Kilmer and Shue but the film itself is up and down in tempo and Kilmer never behaves like The Saint we know from the TV series.Ultimately Kilmer seems to be enjoying himself trying different accents but he never comes across The Saint which is the film's biggest failing.

Ivan Tretiak hires him to steal the formula for cold fusion from American scientist Emma Russel (Elisabeth Shue).This is sort of like a Bond movie if James Bond put on ugly disguises in silly voices and steals for himself. The disguises look too silly. It diminishes the attempt to be cool and relevant. Instead of silly disguises, it should really concentrate on the spy tradecrafts. Val Kilmer does an internal dialog which could be better used to highlight his skills. The other problem is that there are too much Russian in this. I don't understand why Russia would have a heating oil crisis. It tries to be exotic, but ends up as unsatisfying.There is also the minor problem of Elisabeth Shue. She's supposed to be this weird loner scientist, and she doesn't have that persona. And she plays it as a love sick puppy to one of Val Kilmer's fake character. She is the all American girl next door, and they need a quirky scientist type. And the point is to get somebody else to replicate her results which means she's supposed to write out the experiment for them to try. It's a stupid idea that she would write out the formula and stuff it in her bra. I want to like this for Elisabeth Shue, but this is too silly.

Both are movies about the discovery of free energy and powerful people trying to get their hands upon it. The difference with the Saint is that the Saint, or Simon Templar (Val Kilmer) is a thief. He angers a very powerful Russian after stealing a microchip and is then set up by him to steal the plans for a cold fusion reactor.There are numerous intricacies in this plot, namely the motivations behind the Russian Millionaire. There is a shortage of oil in Russia which means it is very cold in Moscow and their is now heating. The millionaire is attempting to gain control of Russia and is stirring the people up against the current government.This is an interesting turn of events in the plot lines. Previously it was the evil Russians communists whose plans to take over the world had to be foiled by the good guy. Now that communism has collapsed, there is no longer any powerful bad guy to send the good guys up against. Now it has to be the evil corporations and the evil Russians who are trying to restore communist rule to Russia. Where as before one could not destroy communism and Russia, now it is possible to bring a conclusive ending to the movie.The beginning of the Saint is set in an orphanage in the Far East. It is hard to tell if there is any relevance in this beginning. Its shows us that the Saint was an orphan and that he doesn't have a really name. In fact he shuns the name given to him by the priest. He then watches his girl friend plunge to her death after she is attacked by the dog. What it does not show is if he is blamed for the death or not. What this beginning does not is really make one hate the Catholic orphanage system with the way they abuse the children.The Saint is okay as an action movie. The good guy wins and gets the girl in the end. The girl is no ordinary woman though. She is a scientist but when she first meets the Saint she sees right through his disguise and into his heart. This is what captivates him. He doesn't even want to steal the plans from her, but later his greed overwhelms him and he takes the money. It is fun to watch but that is all.

A lot different from the Roger Moore TV series, it sort of follows the Brosnan Bonds in being a stylish actioner with a slightly absurd plot. Yet it's a very entertaining film with many great things about it. The plot involves Simon Templar who is a master a thief, being able to outsmart the law with unique disguises and accents. He is hired by the Russian Mafia to steal a formula for cold fusion energy from scientist Emma Russell. But Russell intelligence and beauty makes Templar begin to develop feelings for her that he can't walk away from. He decides to help her and must work out the formula before the Russians do. Though the plot is a bit silly, it is actually pretty smart in many places and it never becomes boring. As said it works like one of the more far-fetched Bond films in that it is rather suspect but it doesn't really matter because it is so entertaining, whilst the romantic side keeps things nicely grounded.The cast is impressive. Val Kilmer is terrific as Templar managing to play the smart spy who finds his softer side and he has the charisma to carry it off. Kilmer does a brilliant job at doing different accents and changing appearance too. Elisabeth Shue is excellent as Emma Russell, making her likable and tough but with complexity and issues. Rade Serbedzija makes an effect villain as the slimy and power hungry Tretiak. Valeriy Nikolaev was a little dull as his son, but still believable and did well in the action set pieces. The British veteran Michael Byrne was fantastic as always as Tretiak's adviser. Both Alun Armstrong and Charlotte Cornwell did solid jobs as inspectors on Templar's trail. Though the plot is iffy, nearly everything else is done quite competently. The visual tone that the film goes for is very stylish, the scenes of Russia and Britain look fantastic. The action scenes are also done in a great way, though it doesn't happen too often when it does it is nicely effective. The music is simply superb, the score by Graeme Revell has a cool action tone to it but is also very beautiful, the main theme and 'Love Theme' are both superb. The use of more contemporary music at times was also a smart decision. The most effective thing about the film is the relationship between Templar and Russell. Val Kilmer and Elisabeth Shue have amazing chemistry as a lot of the time you can easily forget they are acting it's so natural. This side of the story helps make it far more interesting that your average action film because you actually care about what these people go through. It's also nice that there's not an overload of action, as the film does a good job of letting the drama tell the story. Overall The Saint offers a refreshing balance of drama, action and character development.

"},{"Title":"One Crooked Halo Doesn't Make A Good Thriller","Date":"5 September 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Romance","Review":" The cliffhanger escapes, the dastardly villains, and the superbly staged action scenes in The Saint are good enough to compensate for the poor casting, slipshod writing, and last-minute script alterations that plague this hagiography. Val Kilmer, fresh from the respectable Ghost and the Darkness and the lukewarm Island of Dr. Moreau, steps into the role of the suave, debonair gentleman adventurer. Kilmer makes the most of the multi-dimensional role. The Leslie Charteris literary hero is a cat burglar, escape artist, gigolo, electronics wizard, man of a thousand faces, and confidence man who survives by the skin of his wits. Although this glossy, $70-million-plus epic is a dazzling looking romantic thriller, The Saint sinks if you think too much about its hi-jinks.The Saint is a kind of freelance 007. Since he escaped from an abusive Catholic school in the Far East at age five, Simon Templar has been amassing a fortune. Templar refuses to retired until his bank account tops $50-million. Lately, the Saint has been sparring with Ivan Tretiak (Rade Serberdzija of Manifesto), a long-haired Russian tycoon who runs the mafia in Moscow. A shortage of heating fuel has crippled Mother Russia in the dead of winter. Hundreds are freezing. Ivan wants to parlay the heating crisis into a way to topple Russian president Karpov (Eugeny Lazarev of The Ice Runner). As it turns out, an astute American scientist, Dr. Emma Russell (Elizabeth Shue of Adventures in Babysitting) has devised a formula for something called cold fusion that can save Russians and help Tretiak make more marks in Russians eyes than Lenin. Tretiak turns to the Saint to steal the secret formula from Emma.Australian director Philip Noyce spent his last two assignments putting Harrison Ford through the paces of Patriot Games and A Clear and Present Danger. Die Hard with a Vengeance scribe Jonathan Hensleigh co-scripted The Saint with Cape Fear writer Wesley Strick. Despite their considerable talent and imagination, they faltered in their efforts to fit the character into the 1990s. For the record, Charteris wrote 90 original Saint Novels beginning with Meet the Tiger (1928) and ending with Salvage for the Saint (1983).When we first spot him, the Saint is getting flogged by a priest because he won't conform. The child rebels and escapes from the school, but not before he causes the death of his childhood sweetheart. Kilmer's Simon Templar has a politically correct dark side because he feels guilty about the girl's accidental death. Incidentally, The Saint is a chick flick. Val bares his chest, but Elizabeth Shue doesn't. While The Saint contains Indiana Jones-style derring-do, the film never drenches itself in blood, gore, nudity, or profanity. You don't have to shield your eyes from anything offensive. The Saint amounts to a one-man Mission Impossible with the emphasis on serio-comic romance and danger. Eventually, the Saint and the scientist team up to take on the bad guys. The Russian winters appear picture postcard perfect as captured by lenser Phil Meheux, and The Saint makes splendid use of Red Square and other notable sights. And it's not Kilmer's Saint who gives the Russians the formula for fire, but Shue's soft-hearted scientist.The problem here is that Shue is woefully miscast as a nerdy she-scientist. She is a great actress, but she just doesn't fit the role. The Saint asks us to believe that a babe like Shue could be a brilliant scientist. Actually, she would have been more credibly cast as the babe daughter of a brilliant scientist. More than likely Hensleigh and Strick have compressed two characters into one character. They then ask us to believe that a scientist as brilliant as she is would abandon her principles for Kilmer's pectorals. She confides in Simon that he never had to steal what she was willing to give away. This almost makes it all too easy for Simon. Oh, yes, how many brilliant scientists store their secret formulas on scrap pieces of paper in their brassiere? Finally, Hensleigh and Strick dream up a flaw for Shue's scientist; she suffers from heart disease. There is nothing wrong with a character who has flaws. They even feature a scene where the Saint nearly freezes to save her heart pills from floating down river. There is nothing wrong with that either. Except by the end of the movie, however, Shue's brilliant scientist no longer requires her heart medication. So why did they make such a big fuss about them in the first place? This is another sign that the writers have their halos on crooked.As heroes go, The Saint isn't so much a saint to cheer as a sultan to envy. Indeed, Kilmer's Cupid good-looks will seduce the ladies, but the guys will lust after his new candy-apple red Volvo C-70 coupe, his playboy lifestyle, padded bank account, and eternal ability to outsmart his foe. If there were ever a movie that sold itself on the charisma of its protagonist, The Saint does, with a pasha's price tag. Sadly, in terminating one Saint for a more venerable Saint, the filmmakers have sold out not only a sound plot line but the character's literary heritage. If you looking for fast, breezy nonsense that look fantastic, The Saint is worth a peek.

While this film by Phillip Noyce may seem like a rip off, it is based on source material that predates Bond by several decades. Unfortunately that doesn't quite make it's chances in competition with rival thrillers any easier. As a spy thriller, the Saint is certainly watchable, even enjoyable, but it feels stiff and not terribly clever, and a central part of the plot is oriented on a wooden romance.It's hard to say whether the Saint is good or almost good. At least it is always moving, so I wouldn't call the film dull. Nevertheless, there are a few sequences that feel uncomfortable. The bits are mostly in regards to a clumsily written, and poorly acted chemistry between Val Kilmer and Elizabeth Shue as his 'bond girl'. She asks him who he is, and he tells he that no body knows , least of all him. Actually we the audience don't get to know much either. The Saint as a character, when you rethink the movie, feels largely under defined. His abilities, motifs, are explained in questionable fashion, the closest, that the movie gets is an opening scene depicting his childhood in a seminary school, where he can pick locks, and wins girls hearts behind the priests back. The introduction feels a bit off, but things get going fast enough to keep you in your seat. Kilmer and Shue get chased numerous times through Moscow by corrupt leaders, and Kilmer has to switch identities/nationalities/accents numerous times so he can bring them down. The film's ending feels over stretched, leaving The Saint about five or six minutes longer than necessary. In aiming for something slick or quirky, The Saint overshoots by a bit. All in all, the movie could use a little work. It is enjoyable without being unique or special. What it's needs is to be a bit looser. It's a stiff thriller, but at least it's not a dull one.

Simon steals a microchip from the leader of the Russian Mafia, played by Rade Serbedzija, then he is hired by the same guy to steal the formula for cold fusion. Of course, the person who has the formula for cold fusion just happens to be a beautiful young scientist, played by Elisabeth Shue. Well, one thing leads to another, Simon uses a bunch of disguises, the good guys win, and the bad guys lose.What was Elisabeth Shue doing in this movie? She gave one of the finest performances I have ever seen in Leaving Las Vegas, and one of her follow-ups is this? I could have played her part. Just dress me up and put a little lipstick on me, and I could run around with Val Kilmer for a couple of hours. The Saint could have been a good, Mission Impossible type of thriller, but instead it turns out not to be. If you're a fan of Val Kilmer, it's not a bad movie, he gets to dress up a lot and use a lot of accents. If you're a fan of Elisabeth Shue, she smiles a lot and looks as beautiful as she usually does. If you're a fan of really good movies, go rent something else.

So, it was concieved that he'd be a sort of flawed hero who would be encouraged into being more like the Saint we know by his encounter with his romantic interest.  Making Val Kilmer don weird disguises was an unusal way of abusing the Saint name, though.  Nothing in the film really feels much like it belongs as part of the myth of the Saint.  It's not abad film, it's actually a very well crafted thriller with some style.  it just doesn't have a whole lot to do with the Saint books or TV show since they were trying to create an origin story.  I admire the effort, but overall it doesn't fit with the tone of what The Saint is all about.

Although the plot is quite far fetched and the acting is questionable, there is a very enjoyable element to this film. Similar to titles like The Recruit and Entrapment, there are several very enjoyable parts to this film. The soundtrack is a well selected mix of fast paced techno and eloquent ambient sounds, without forgetting the iconic Saint theme tune, well worth watching just for this. The gadgets included in the film are elegantly selected and well used, adding comfort and interest to the story line. And the make up and disguises used by the main character are brilliantly done, Kilmer supplies a handsome but moulded face to the title, able to fit in without looking too obvious, this adding a vital part to the film. Kilmer pulls off the suave but vulnerable thief well, with Shue playing the part of the eccentric love interest. This is neither's strongest role, but Rade Serbedzija is on top form as expected, playing the part of the evil Russian billionaire. Don't expect great things from this title, but the soundtrack, the gadgets and The Saint's suave and stealthy moves make it very watchable.

As a result, he steals from them, making use of disguises&#151;partly to compensate for his own lack of identity.People forget that the Saint's creator, Leslie Charteris, was half-Singaporean Chinese, teased at school in England for his appearance. It is not surprising to expect that Charteris himself felt bitter about racism and how English society looked down on any non-whites; thus, the Saint books have a strong antiestablishment sense about them. Read from the perspective of a minority in a foreign country, they offer an added dimension which others, lacking this experience, might miss.Given Charteris's own history, it is reasonable to expect from him a character who tries to conceal his identity, who steals from those in position, who attempts to be a chameleon this is the fantasy of his alter ego. The movie delivers here.It is less reasonable to think, however, that Simon Templar would steal a formula from Dr Emma Russell (Elisabeth Shue), who has humanitarian aims in mind, to help Ivan Tretiak (Rade Serbedzija), a Russian energy billionaire and politician. It is difficult to contemplate Templar being a thief without conscience as the scriptwriters have done.One explanation is that director Noyce positioned this movie as a prequel to the books. One can assume that the real Simon Templar whom we all know surfaces when he decides to turn against Tretiak and his mob. But this is not enough of an explanation Templar may want to forget his past, but he has not sold his soul.It is an entertaining update, provided Saint fans approach the movie with an open mind. It will seriously disappoint those who expect continuity in style and spirit with the TV series, and had Charteris been alive, I believe he would have disapproved, because of his aristocratic lineage, of Kilmer's ungentlemanly portrayal. My regret is that the Saint character has never been played by a half-Chinese, which will give the Charteris books the edge they deserve, and also allow audiences to understand his antiestablishment nature. But I, too, understand an establishment that of Hollywood. For it, a Chinese Saint would simply be too far-fetched to be accepted. Another opportunity missed.

This definitely wasn't The Saint of Leslie Charteris, and it wasn't even Simon Templar as Roger Moore played him.  The bits and pieces of scenes describing Simon's background seemed the only reason to make this a remake, otherwise, the producers could have used a different title and made Val a different character.Considering how witty Moore's Templar was, it made Val seem grim in comparison, and Charteris never intended Simon to be grim.  But the story that was told was okay, Val and Liz did as well as they could with the script they were given, and the stuntmen had their work cut out for them. The producers made a decision to design and film the movie in a particular way, and comments here and elsewhere show that those decisions didn't meet the audience's complete acceptance.Perhaps the only aw! moment in the movie was at the end, as Simon speeds away from the police and turns on the radio to hear the newsreader announcing multi-million dollar mystery donations to global charities--that comforting and silky voice is Roger Moore's.  It would have been nice if there had been a touch more saintliness about Val throughout the movie (and it would have been nice if the producers had done some research).

Of the two movies, I prefer 'The Avengers' because, whether you like it or not, it at least resembles the television series on which it is based. 'The Saint' tries to be 'Mission Impossible' meets 'Goldeneye', and fails dismally. As soon as Kilmer's casting was announced, I knew it was doomed. Simon Templar should never be played by an American. Kilmer was fine as 'Batman', but all wrong for 'The Saint'. I wasn't convinced by the romance with the Elisabeth Shue character. Templar's disguises are so patently unconvincing you wonder why no-one sees through them. Jonathan Hensleigh's script is mediocre compared to the John Kruse T.V. episodes 'The Fiction Makers' and 'The Death Game'. It didn't help that the original ending was deleted, and a lame new one substituted. Best thing about the movie was Orbital's pulse-pounding arrangement of Edwin Astley's theme.

Well, name value and selling it to fans of the series, probably.  But those are exactly the folks that will be most disappointed with the movie.  Val Kilmer does the best he can, saddled with goofy disguises and accents.  The plot tends to drag in the middle, the metaphors are obvious (Templar had his heart broken, Russell has a literal broken heart), and it's not until the end that the producers seem to remember that the Saint was a _fun_ character.

But I actually really didn't enjoy this movie, it wasn't just the story, because over all it didn't seem like a bad idea. I think it was the cast, Val has a pretty crappy Russian accent, you gotta admit.But this movie is about a guy named Simon named after the saint of magic, he becomes a spy of some sort and is spying on the Russian Mafia. He ends up getting deeper and deeper when he steals a girl's plans about how she could save the world of pollution that the Mafia also wishes to get their hands on. He ends up of course falling for the girl and she goes on the adventure with him.Over all, I'd say this wasn't a terrible movie, but it wasn't my cup of tea, but I couldn't see why someone else might enjoy it. I think it's something you have to judge for yourself.

When the Russians come after them, things only get worse.Film never seems to go anywhere and has too many endings, but Val is fun to watch and Elisabeth is hard not to like as the lover.One of the thugs chasing Val and Liz appeared as Russell Crowe's sidekick of sorts in Gladiator and he had a role in Braveheart somewhere.

My advice to any movie producers out there is to start again with an English actor and just forget the Kilmer film was ever made. The beginning episodes of this film, giving the Saint a past and a reason for being, were ridiculous, overlong and unnecessary. The Saint doesn't need a reason to exist other than the fact he enjoys the mayhem he brings into the lives of criminals. Also ridiculous was making Templar a master of disguise. The whole point about the Saint was that everybody knew who he was, letting him attract business, women, thrills and lots of money. If the Saint was such a master of disguise, how the hell would anyone be able to find him, let alone get him into so much trouble? Sorry, Paramount, nil points, start again!

You would be forgiven for forgetting this fact, however, as Kilmer spends most of the movie going crazy in the costume department, thus rendering him unrecognisable for the majority of the film. The plot follows the story of a young boy in a boarding home that grows up to become the enigmatic 'saint', who is the title character of this film. The Saint then goes on to become a spy and thief, and one that bows to the highest bidder. The film really gets going when The Saint gets hired for a job, one that will put him up to the $50 million mark (his goal for retirement). This job requires him to steal the formula for cold fusion from a young lady...but after he falls in love with her, will he be able to do it?As mentioned earlier, Val Kilmer takes the title role. Val Kilmer proved his acting ability with his complete embodiment of Jim Morrison in The Doors. This movie doesn't require any acting ability of that calibre, but it still allows Val to show his ability. At several points in the movie, he is required to pretend to be a different character, and that requires him to put on a different accent. This requires talent, not everyone can do that. I'm not saying that Kilmer deserves an Oscar, but he has an obvious talent for acting. Also featuring in this cast is Elizabeth Shue, a lady whom movie fans might remember from the latter two parts of the Back to the Future trilogy. She doesn't really impress in this movie; she does her job, but her role doesn't really leave an opening for to impress with. Aside from these two, the cast of The Saint is more or less totally made up of lesser-known actors.For a film like this, you would expect basic popcorn entertainment, and that's how it should have been. Although the movie never really requires you to flex your brain muscles, it does have a rather complicated plot. I have no problem with complicated plots, but they are out of place in a movie of this ilk. It should be fun, and therefore complex plots have no place. The movie also doesn't have much of a sense of humour about itself, and it is directed almost humourlessly. This comes off rather badly as a lot of Val Kilmer's characters are people that you could laugh at, and the movie should have capitalised on this fact more, as it would have made it a more enjoyable ride. The movie does feature some exciting sequences, in fact it never really gets boring; but had it have been better directed, and had Val Kilmer's character have been capitalised on more, it could have become the entertaining blockbuster that it obviously wants to be.Although the movie is somewhat fun to watch, it could have been a lot better. It's joylessly directed and despite the talent of it's lead, it never really impresses. It's a shame as this could have been a hit, but due to it's flaws; I'm afraid that it gets an overall thumbs down.

The entire film is a setup for a sequel, but they didn't even do that well. An antagonistic relationship between Scotland Yard and the Saint was established.  Then, although the yard KNEW that Shue's character was in love with him, they didn't tail her car when she went to see him.  They wasted an opportunity for a sensitive conversation between Shue and Kilmer during which they could have had her implant the value of philanthropic work (perhaps waxing sentimental about her father's work, and her desire to do as much good as he did) and, instead, had him pace the room saying She's too nice; I can't do this.  It was embarrassing.  The only reason implied for his sudden philanthropy at the end of the flick is the barbie-and-ken relationship they established between Shue and Kilmer. Miracle 1, miracle 2, miracle 3...that plot device makes lethal injection too good a reward for the writer.  If they were really serious about a sequel, they should have made the first movie worth watching.  There are so many plot choices that were mistakes, I won't go into them all.
