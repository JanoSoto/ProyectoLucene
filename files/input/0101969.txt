However, there's absolutely no denying the manner in which the story is presented; the magnificent symbolism throughout; the threaded character arcs; visuals; dialogue &#150; is absolute masterwork. I've watched the movie dozens of times, and I still marvel at its perfection. There's not a moment, action, cut, or line that doesn't have everything to do with the theme.

The fact he was black had little, if anything, to do with it (color is simply used to draw the parallel. And the chasm. It's no accident the opening sequence shifts from black and white to color either). If you view the blacks in this movie as &#145;token' &#150; you may want to reassess YOUR angst. You may be seeing only black and white yourself, eh. Just a thought.

Kasdan takes the search for meaning in our lives and lays it out for all to see and wonder at.  The movie is about the divides people create to insulate themselves from the violence and hatred and bigotry of everyday life.     Along the way we are asked question after question about life.  Davis (Steve Martin with a great beard) asks himself 'Is my making a violent movie (and by extension  our enjoyment of it) causing the violence in society?'  Claire asks What kind of world throws away something as precious as a human life?'  Mack is not immune as he asks 'Is it possible to pass beyond the bounds of race and (an even harder step) finance?  These are of course not quoted from the film, but generalities.  Others ask their questions too, and to be honest it raises more than it answers.   But that is the nature of life.  We strive all our lives to find answers to questions we will never totally answer, and in certain cases have to make answers fit to our own needs and desires.  As humans we thrive on questions we cannot answer.  Some answers are real.  Claire and Mack come to realize that even though they could take the easy road and let the state take the baby, their finding it placed the responsibility for her life in their hands.  Some answers are not.  Davis `Sees the Light' and decides not to make violent films, but the next day turns around and dismisses his epiphany as subordinate to his art.   We all seek answers.  This movie does not answer them for; it simply reminds you to keep looking for the answers.

Hope that it isn't too late to save people from the terrible things that go on in so many lives. Gangland violence is real, right? Is it right, no! This movie carries an important social message which the cynics may dislike but which nonetheless is to be praised, rather than denigrated.

The dialogue, acting, casting and direction are superb. No two by fours, no grand revelations.

There are just so many powerful moments, such an intelligent and moving story, such incredible performances.    It perfectly captures the confusion and violence that were so rampant in the early nineties.  But it also dramatically affirms the capacity of individuals to love, think and care.  In a slight way, the movie was of its time.  It partly portrays society as a balloon about to burst. Because the country was in a recession, and so void of leadership, this was true of that time. But the movie is also timeless.      I think it could honestly stand up against any movie that has ever been made, and it is the most overlooked film of all time.

I think Grand Canyon is entirely under-rated, and is in fact one of the greatest American contemporary films. I have seen it many times, and am amazed at Kasden's directorial and writing skills. I think most reviewers don't understand it! I see very glib reviews about this film but seldom indepth comment.I believe this film is about synchronicity, life-purpose/meaning and the feeling of powerlessness and isolation of people in a fast-moving culture where youth passes rapidly,transition is constant, and big-brother is watching. Outstanding acting from all actors, indepth characterizations and real-life dilemnas. I love the way Simon who appears to be the doubting Thomas and only believes in fate without purpose begins to understand human interconnection towards the end of the film. Though I don't necessarily agree that the problems of a few little people don't matter a hill of beans in relation to the majesty of the Grand Canyon, I see Kasden's point that perspective on our lives is important!I don't know much about Kasden but have tried to learn more. He seems to manage to insert his spiritual message in an entirely entertaining way in recent films witness French Kiss and Mumford...both of which deal cleverly with loss and reinventing ourselves. I suspect he wrote many of the Jedi and Yoda parts of the original Star Wars films --the Jedi philosophy seems consistent with his own.  I am a student of Conscious Creation concepts and love films so am always happy to see how Mr. Kasden weaves his message into his latest films.Thank you, Mr. Kasden and please keep creating!

For a superb 137 minutes flashing by, directing, acting, and screenwriting hit a nearly flawless note. Sucking on this bottle for instant gratification, however, is contra-indicated.  Grand Canyon does not leave home with a nursemaid. Those who lust for predictable Hollywood spin with contrived drama and only fantastic elements of human life will feel unsatisfied with Director and Screenwriter (with Meg Kasdan) Lawrence Kasdan's stubborn defiance of proper genre hygiene. Kasdan's visual poetry draws us in to a world of separate images, forcing potential connections to jack-knife through the mind.  Yet Kasdan provides no answers, at least not quickly.  The radomness deliberately provokes preconditioning that everything happens for a reason in the movies. Nothing connects.  Nothing makes sense in the formula way wished subconciously.  After all, one sees movies to escape life, not to immerse in it.  The viewer's frustration peaks and the introspective see Kasdan's point about life's overwhelming radomness.  Grand Canyon's scenes unfold throughout L.A. and Kasdan brilliantly plays on everyday scenarios of commutes, dodgy neighborhoods, and family tension until familiarity and frustration forces the viewer to hold these images as their own.  The tension of the film binds with our personal emotions about how alienating life can be, about how alone we really are. For those who evaluate their suspended belief on his terms, Kasdan has a rich reward.  He spoons us our medication precisely when we need it and not when we think we do.  Yet by now there is little desire to fast-forward. We are entering with a sort of intrinsic trust into Kasdan's world.  He has established that to get his story we need every word, each nuance. Kasdan's pace does not disapoint but takes off as the relationships form. His cuts and dialogue sync perfectly to the state of his characters as they (and we) make the connections.  Grand Canyon truly gallops just a step in front of its audience beckoning with analytical gestures into its emotional content. But just as his message of alienation seems drilled one too many times Kasdan lifts the man-hole cover off a new hole and declares alienation isn't really what he's talking about at all.  The isolating radomness is exposed as a delicate lure that creates humanity and a sense of fragility in the viewer; an understanding of the shared poignancy of coming and going ultimately, alone. We see Kasdan is really speaking of how the life's randomness heightens the beauty of connections to others simply because life usually makes no sense and of the responsibility to light the candle for people simply because we grope in darkness ourselves.  In a movie as abstractly symbolic and thought provoking as Apocalypse Now, Kasdan creates what could be Apocalypse Now's alter ego, the gentle side.  His characters unveil a chosen logic, a purposeful proactivity that seems heroic in their chaotic world.  However, the superb acting eliminates the possibility that Grand Canyon is populated with two dimensional goody-two-shoes.  In fact, it is not so much of a stretch to imagine these characters were ourselves in their situations, a refreshing twist from the standard wannabe Hollywood fantasy.  Kasdan does not exude easy answers, but seems to nudge us, asking what would you do? as we realize how precisely his everyday, chaotic world mirrors our own and how many untapped choices might be right here with us the moment we finish watching his movie and begin our life.

I've watched it several times now and I still feel as I did the first time; that this film, by itself, could make up the entire curriculum of a post-graduate course in film direction. A long time ago film trailers used to promise, It'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry. That's a very trite and shorthand method of describing what Grand Canyon does. It takes you to the best places in human experience and the next moment takes you to the gates of hell. Much of the film is paced to cycle back and forth between people being close to happiness and the same people being close to horror. It's always a short step, too. Just to manage that swing with grace and without making it look false or exaggerated is directorial genius.Spoiler (of sorts) coming up. After getting the audience used to rocking back and forth through the emotional spectrum, the film throws a curve with a sequence that doesn't go from good to bad and back but instead escalates from an ordinary marital spat, through an accidental self-inflicted knife wound that may or may not require stitches, to an earthquake that has the characters run from the house. In the moment of their relief, argument forgotten, cut finger forgotten, the earthquake survived, a neighbor woman calls out that her elderly husband has collapsed. The couple rushes to his aid. I cried when I saw this sequence. I cried every time I saw it. I'm crying now. It isn't sadness that does this to me. It's not a particularly sad sequence. What tears me up is that this few minutes of film was PERFECT. That's PERFECT! Astounding. (end of spoiler)There's so much to say about Grand Canyon. It portrays relatively ordinary people experiencing epiphanies and it lets the viewer experience them vicariously. They aren't showy or overblown and there's no long pause to examine the moment carefully. The film moves on at the pace of life. Even when the characters do try to make sense of what has happened, they are uncertain of what to derive from their experience. Grand Canyon is a very human film.

I first saw the film when I was 17 years old. How did I hear about it? It was reviewed, and recommended highly, by Siskel & Ebert in 1991, and I eventually caught it on video a year later.It's a great film, a powerful film, a healing film, about the power of listening, truly listening to one another. I've seen it six times now, and it entertains and inspires me with every subsequent viewing. But why the poor reviews for this movie? Maltin's movie guide gives it two out of four. Too melodramatic, too much coincidence, too sappy, are the expressions that I read the most. Yes, there is melodrama in this story, and yes, there is a lot of coincidence, too. But it delivers with an intensity and force that seems supple. For all of the plot that exists in Grand Canyon, such as drive-by shootings, a police chase, an earthquake, a love affair, a woman's discovery of a baby in the bushes, another shooting, a near accident by a new driver, and worldly advice from a homeless man, this movie wins because of the smart performances by Kevin Kline, Steve Martin, Mary McDonnell, Alfre Woodard, Danny Glover, and Jeremy Sisto. It also succeeds because of Lawrence Kasdan's skillful direction and writing. You know that this isn't just another movie when you consider a sequence at the beginning of the film that involves Kevin Kline being harassed by four black youths. Danny Glover plays a tow truck driver who assists the Kline character, but not before he gets harassed too, by the leader of the bunch. Listen to the dialogue as the kid suggests to Glover,Are you afraid of me because of me, or because I have a gun?.Grand Canyon is filled with one perceptive scene after another. Steve Martin should have been nominated for best supporting actor as a movie producer who has a change of heart and then a subsequent change of mind. I think his character is a warning that the good can carry us forward, that idealism is a virtue, but one that we must fight for constantly rather than depend upon.I fear that Grand Canyon may be lost forever in the wilderness of non-new releases at the video store. But with the deals now on older releases as low as 99 cents, I plead with anyone who has read this far into a review from a reviewer that you will thank after having rented it, Grand Canyon is something special. If you loved Magnolia, another movie with a big ensemble about deep humanist themes, you'll love Grand Canyon, too.

It is further noted that the other half ARE hysterical, and the predominant aspect of their lives is attempting to control their constant fear; fear generated entirely by the very nature of their environment, and just the way things `are.'  It's a thought provoking concept of life in the &#145;90s and beyond, and of a world in which babies are abandoned, people live in boxes on the street and the guy with the gun is in charge.  And as another character so succinctly points out, `This isn't the way the world is supposed to work--'  All of which and more is considered by director Lawrence Kasdan in his evocative drama `Grand Canyon,' starring Danny Glover, Kevin Kline and Mary McDonnell.  It's a contemplation of the kind of world in which we are forced to live, the huge gaps and voids it creates in our lives, and the decisions and choices we make in an effort to fill the crevasses it all forms in our souls.  This is more than just a film, it's a statement; a reflection upon what it takes for millions of people from all walks of life to get out of bed every morning and face the day.  And for those who care enough and are bold enough to look deeply into Kasdan's eyes, there's a message to be found here, and a powerful one it is.In the song `Johnny 99,' Bruce Springsteen sings about a part of town where `When you hit a red light you don't stop,' and when Mack (Kline) leaves a Laker's game at the Forum and decides to try a short cut to avoid traffic, it is precisely in `that' part of town that his car gives up the ghost.  His cell phone is dead, but he manages to find a phone booth and call for road service.  But just as he gets back to his car, he becomes the target of a gang of armed young hoodlums out for an easy score or possibly more.  And when things are looking about as bad as they can for Mack, the tow truck arrives, and out steps a man named Simon (Glover), who thankfully knows a thing or two about negotiating with gang members; after all, this is his turf-- where he lives and makes his living.  Simon takes Mack out of harms way, and it is at that auspicious moment that a convergence of two heretofore divergent worlds occurs.Mack is an immigration lawyer who lives and works within the environs of the Miracle Mile; Simon is a part of the town in Springsteen's song.  Two individuals from different worlds whom fate brings together for a split second; and It's a moment that is destined to change both their lives forever, and like ripples issuing from a stone dropped into a pond, it is soon going to touch and make a difference in many other lives, as well.  Mack and Simon are about to learn a few things from one another, the most important of which may be found in Simon's perspective of the human race, and the significance of `people' when compared to one of Eternity's masterworks, the Grand Canyon.Lawrence Kasdan and Meg Kasdan wrote the screenplay for this film, from which Mr. Kasdan proceeds to deliver one of his finest cinematic offerings.  As previously stated, this is more than a film; it's a contemplation of who we are and what we have become as a species during our time upon this planet, and where it's all taken us.  And under Kasdan's steady guidance and insightful gaze, it is truly riveting drama that works especially well because there is something in it to which everyone will be able to identify or relate.  Certainly it will strike a deeper chord with those who live or have spent time in a large metropolitan area; the situations in this film will resonate much more for someone who has lived in L.A., as opposed to those born and raised in Independence, Oregon, for example.  But all will find a connection with the human issues Kasdan so incisively examines, because they are universal in nature.  Quite simply, Kasdan hits a perfect pitch here.  This is emotionally involving drama from beginning to end, aided in no small part by the mesmerizing score by Bill Conti and James Newton Howard that serves as a veritable pulse for the entire film.The outstanding ensemble cast matches Kasdan's excellence with a number of unforgettable performances, beginning with Kline and Glover.  Kline gives the kind of performance we've come to expect from him, which is to say convincing, believable and entirely credible.  He explores all of the nooks and crannies of his character and concisely expresses all that he finds there.  Glover, too, hits his stride perfectly, making Simon genuine and real by finding his character's center and effectively maintaining his focus on it.It is Mary McDonnell, however, who nearly steals the show with her portrayal of Claire, Mack's wife.  This is an extremely complex character, and McDonnell manages to thoroughly examine all of her myriad emotional levels and express them convincingly.  This is a woman at a most fragile time of her life, with the concerns of being a loving, devoted wife in conflict with her more maternal nature; coping with the sense of loss associated with the fact that her only child, Roberto (Jeremy Sisto) is fifteen and growing up too fast, and seeking to satisfy her need to nurture.  In Claire, McDonnell creates a woman with an absolute aura of beauty about her; it's a brilliant performance that is the very heart of the film.And finally, Steve Martin (Davis), Mary-Louise Parker (Dee) and Alfre Woodard (Jane) take `Grand Canyon' to the zenith of cinematic accomplishment.  10/10.

Kasdan wants to present life, simply, ordinary life. The conventionally structured story, where characters have insights that change their lives, and then fade out, music up, and the film is over, is absorbed into this much larger canvas. Several characters in this movie have just such illuminations, and then they move on. Sometimes they can hold onto their insights, sometimes they can't, and that's the way life really is. In other words, Kasdan jettisons conventional dramatic structure in favor of an exploration of the the ongoingness of life &#150; there is no happy ending, only an eventual ending; and everything before that is still in process, still always up for grabs &#150; and, if you absolutely insist on a theme, an exploration of the role of the miraculous in our lives. What is a miracle? Well, life itself, for a start. Then add in all the random incidents and cross-connections that make up a life, or several interconnected lives, and you have miracles by the bucketful. Kasdan underscores this theme lightly, rather than insisting on it, and bolsters it in various ways, most memorably by the device, right in the center of the film, of having Mac and his wife, lying in bed, each dreaming their own dreams, but as well showing, later on in the film, how those dreams have the power, within the film, to shape reality. This is not a film with an easy or obvious message. You just have to let it play out in front of you, and then let it sit in your mind for a few days, a month, a few years, and see what it has wrought there. This is, without a doubt, Kasdan's best film, his most mature, his most humane. A major meditation on life from one of our most gifted writers and directors. The tragedy is, of course, that he has not been allowed to work for a number of years now, mostly due to studio constraints around Dreamcatcher. Hopefully we haven't heard the last from Larry Kasdan. A great film from a great artist. Keep in mind that art does not have to rationalize itself completely in order to succeed.

If you liked Grand Canyon, and like movies about ideas, I recommend Jane Campion's An Angel at My Table and David Lean's A Passage to India. I'm a guy, but I like films with strong female characters and males who aren't always oozing macho muck.

The plot is disjointed and desultory. Numerous unimaginative plot contrivances keep the film going, like a drive-by shooting, an abandoned baby left in the weeds, a gang of thugs intimidating a lawyer, a guy flying through the night sky over the city, a kid at summer camp.And through all these events, the one constant is the generous helping of sociological insights imparted through the dialogue, as characters compare notes on their life experiences. One character tells another When you sit on the edge of that thing (the Grand Canyon), you realize what a joke we people are; ... those rocks are laughing at me, I could tell, me and my worries; it's real humorous to that Grand Canyon.And another character pontificates about the meaning of it all There's a gulf in this country, an ever widening abyss between the people who have stuff and the people who don't have ... it's like this big hole has opened up in the ground, as big as the ... Grand Canyon, and what's come pouring out ... is an eruption of rage, and the rage creates violence ....Aside from the horribly unnatural and forced dialogue, aside from the shallow, smarmy characters, aside from the dumb plot, the story's pace is agonizingly slow. Acting is uninspired and perfunctory. The film's tone is smug and self-satisfied, in the script's contempt for viewers.This was a film project approved by Hollywood suits who fancy themselves as omnipotent gurus, looking down from on high. They think their film will be a startling revelation to us lowly, unknowing movie goers, eager to learn about the real meaning of American social change.

Released about 14 years sooner than the former film, Grand Canyon was a movie about two people from different backgrounds who come together as friends over a lifetime. To me Crash was still a slightly better film, but Grand Canyon was no slouch either.Taking place in Los Angeles, an upper-class lawyer named Mack (Kevin Kline) takes a shortcut through the seedier side of town only to have his car break down at the worst time. He calls for a tow truck, and has to wait for awhile, only to soon be threatened by a group of dangerous people who want his car. Soon the tow truck driver arrives at the perfect moment, and out steps Simon (Danny Glover) to take the truck away. Both men are threatened, but Simon manages to get himself, Mack, and the car out of dire straits. It is from here on out that a friendship develops between the two men over a lifetime with Mack helping out Simon just as Simon had helped him out of a dangerous situation earlier. You see Simon's sister Deborah (Tina Lifford) is living in a dangerous neighborhood with her two children, and fears for her oldest son who seems to be roaming the streets at night with some bad people. Mack offers them a better place to live as well as hooking Simon up with his secretary's friend Jane (Alfre Woodard).This is the main plot of the film, but there are other smaller plots involving the same secretary mentioned above (Mary Louise Parker) as well as Mack's wife, (Mary McDonnel) who discovers an abandoned baby not long after their son Roberto (Jeremy Sisto in his first movie role) has gone to camp for the summer, and will likely be moving on with his own life soon. The details of all these plots are brought together into one complex movie which uses a police helicopter as a metaphor for life and as a bridge to entwine all the different scenes. This simple plot device works very well and helps greatly with the flow of the story.The director Lawrence Kasdan, whose biggest movie to this date was The Big Chill, has created a splendid movie here. The cast is excellent, and most of the ideas are well thought out, but alas it falls short of greatness because some points, that would've made the film even stronger, are glossed over. The story involving the secretary is one, and the second involving Simon's nephew is the other. These scenes should've been more apart of the entire story, and then maybe Lawrence Kasdan's views of life between the upper and lower classes would've been more on a superior level instead of just very good. Still Grand Canyon exceeded expectations, and yes you will get to see a view of the canyon that this movie was named after. There is also a small role for Steve Martin as Davis, a producer of violent films, who offers his own views on life, and has a small part to play in this movie's ideas.

Meanwhile, movie producer Davis (Steve Martin in a serious role) thinks that gratuitous violence is really cool...until he gets shot. There's also some existentialism in the movie Mack and his family come to realize that they aren't living as they really want.It seems that Crash has somewhat renewed people's interest in race relations, but this one came out much earlier.

Crash tried to show how racism was bad (and Crash actually had a built-in anti Asian bias) and to come at it from a morally superior position. Grand Canyon came at things from such a raw and real perspective that it actually ends up on a higher ground than crash. Especially when you compare the endings. The ending of crash is this supposedly neat little ending that ties everything up. While Grand Canyon simply ends on a quiet note, where you know nothing much will change in the character's lives but that's because life just goes on too, there's no suitable ending.

With Grand Canyon Kasdan shows us a frightening, realistic story laced with humor and humanity about finding small miracles within the lives that we lead, instead of looking for greater ones.  Kevin Kline and Danny Glover notable performances in their careers. Steve Martin plays it dramatic effectively, but being Martin, must inject humor here and there.  Mary McDonnell, Mary-Louise Parker, and Alfre Woodard give strong support as well.  Grand Canyon is one of the finest films released in 1991, and though it received an Academy Award nomination for Original Screenplay, it seemed to be unjustly passed over.  Though over two hours long and filled with only dialogue, Grand Canyon is a must-see motion picture, if you appreciate intelligent, provoking and metaphorical writing, proving points in subtle humanity instead of exploding effects.

The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind of the Grand Canyon.While this movie may not be for everyone, especially if you rent it thinking it's a western, well, it may still be worth viewing.The haunting music that quietly accents the whole film till the powerful brass anthem variation at the ending credits adds to the overall feel of this movie.The surgical operation sequence to remove a bullet from a leg was sickening. Obviously, the intention was to show that a bullet wound is more than just a red spot on clothing.  The scene where the surgeon works through damaged muscle, tendon and shattered bone to remove a bullet and repair the wound was mercifully edited out of the TV version.This movie makes a clever reference to another movie, Sullivan's Travels. Search the database and you will find that this movie was released exactly fifty years before this movie (1941) and has similar themes.  Maybe watching this 1941 film may make some sense out of Grand Canyon for some viewers.Unfortunately, just as there are those who actually visited the real Grand Canyon and found it a spectacular, almost spiritual experience, there are those who think the Grand Canyon is just a big hole, the Parthenon is just a pile of rocks and this movie is just a senseless waste of time.

They happened to meet the right people at the right time and get into the right project which led to other connections and other projects. Quinten Tarrantino took an acting class whose instructor knew Harvey Keitel. Kevin Spacey lifted a back stage pass from a sleeping old woman at the lecture of a famous playwright who helped him land an important role. And Robin Williams credits his career to Gary Marshall's son who, after having seen Star Wars, suggested to his father that an alien should visit the Cunninghams of Happy Days. These coincidences, many times viewed as pure luck, shapes many of the careers in Hollywood today. Or is it pure luck? Is possible something else is going on? Grand Canyon written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan, proposes an altogether different explanation for the inexplicable, aka the strange miraculous coincidence. The movie concerns several different characters whose lives intersect because of positive and yet inexplicable happenstance.Kevin Kline, a middle-aged father, experiences a break-down in one of the more dangerous areas of LA. After he phones a tow truck, a young gang accosts him. They threaten violence if he doesn't leave his car. Just before the confrontation can escalate, Danny Glover appears as the tow truck driver and dampens the intentions of the gang. Although Glover denies it later, he probably saved Kline's life. A producer (Steve Martin) of cheap violent films gets shot in the leg and after wards has a spiritual experience. He then announces retirement from producing blood and gore entertainment. And Kline's wife, Clair (Mary McDonnell), while on a morning jog, finds a baby hidden in some foliage. She claims the baby cried for her and that her rescue of the infant was preordained.The movie explores further the results of these strange connections that lead to further relationships, end to relationships, and new beginnings. And all the while, a strange homeless man appears throughout the movie as if somehow he is also connected to everything that is going on.It is very rare in Hollywood, or for film in general, to explore such a purely esoteric subject. There are a few moments that seem somewhat unbelievable, but maybe that's the point. What makes the film work is the superb acting by the cast. Although the miracles and coincidences may seem far-fetched, the actors make you believe they are experiencing these new realities. Maybe this is a subject we should explore more often.

He's rescued from drug dealers by tow truck driver Danny Glover (in the best scene of the film), and returns the favor by relocating Glover's family to a safer neighborhood, after which everyone goes to see the Arizona landmark of the film's title.Like so many other American movies these days, the whole thing can be summed in a single word overkill.

It starts out powerfully with middle-aged lawyer Kevin Kline taking an unwise detour in L.A. and breaking down on the bad side of town; the situation turns threatening when a group of thugs harass him, but a tow truck driver comes to his aid (Danny Glover). Thus begins a relationship that positively impacts both of their lives and the lives of those connected to them.One subplot involves Kline's love/lust for women (like any red-blooded male). He and his wife (Mary McDonnell) are experiencing the empty nest syndrome; he naturally veers toward an affair at work. There's an early scene where the potential other woman (Mary-Louise Parker) comes into his office at work and puts her hand on his. It's a simple yet potent scene. Is it wrong for Kline to have feelings for this woman? Should he risk destroying his marriage by pursuing a more intimate relationship? And, if he does commit adultery, can he still change his mind before it's too late? Will he?That's just one subplot amongst many. Some reviewers feel there are TOO many stories going on. I suggest they stick to lighter fare, like maybe RV (giggle).Anyway, some themes explored include- Miraculous life-saving encounters. - White/black relations. - The rich/working class/poor divide. - Homelessness. - Why do kids join gangs/become hoodlums? - The challenges of a 20-year nigh romance-less marriage. - The drive to improve one's living standards. - Does violence in film escalate violence or is it simply a reflection of society? Does a filmmaker have a moral responsibility to society? - Life-changing experiences that aren't so life-changing after all. - How many split seconds do you have to make a left turn in downtown traffic? - What do you do after miraculously finding/saving an infant? - Divine intervention. - Matchmaking, blind dates and finding Mr. or Ms. right. - The ripple-effect each person's actions have on others, revealing humanity's significance, which is contrasted by the idea that humanity is inconsequential compared to the Earth & universe's timeless marvels, like the Grand Canyon itself.The picture obviously bites off a lot, but is well able to chew it. It bespeaks of real life and doesn't come off contrived at all. Take for example the teenager's driving lesson He makes a serious mistake and then pulls over. After his father explains a few things he attempts to start the vehicle which is ALREADY running. We've all done that. Another example would be Steve Martin's beautiful redhead girlfriend Vanessa (Sarah Trigger) She's calm, happy and pleasant one moment but then suddenly starts crying (obviously provoked by a statement). A rambling and uncomfortable emotional rant ensues. It's real. Another example would be McDonnell's reaction when her son asks if she and Kline are getting a divorce. Completely shocked, she asks, Why would you ask that?! Do we seem like a couple on the verge of divorce? She KNOWS that her son wouldn't ask such a question unless he sensed there were problems in the marriage on some instinctual level. These are just three minor examples off the top of my head.I've heard some complain that there's no humor. Did we see the same movie? There's actually quite a bit of humor or, at least, amusing and light-hearted moments. (How could there not be with Steve Martin in the cast?). Even though the picture is essentially a serious drama I busted out laughing, snickering or smiling on quite a few occasions. The film delivers in this department. Plus it's realistic humor, not contrived.Scanning through the reviews you'll note that Grand Canyon is a love it or hate it piece. I love it. The acting is, for the most part, great and you really come to care for the characters; you care about the outcome of each of the story lines. One reviewer commented that Grand Canyon is a depressing film; he couldn't be more wrong. Yes, there are some disconcerting story elements, but watch it till the end! Other reviewers criticize Steve Martin, who has a beard and plays a filmmaker. These people need to get a life; Martin was perfect for the role.A couple things I appreciate about Grand Canyon is that it respects the intelligence of the viewer; it's not dumbed-down, nor is everything spelled out. Some things you simply have to read in-between-the-lines, others are left to the imagination. It also provokes you to ponder the numerous issues it addresses for DAYS afterward. Few movies have this effect. In fact, there's so much to Grand Canyon that you'll get something new from the picture with each viewing. Oh, about the New York Times critic that lambasted Grand Canyon as the worst movie ever made (Why sure!) First of all, who cares what some moron at the NY Times says? The very fact that he writes for The Times tells you that his artistic judgment shouldn't be taken too seriously.Also, most critics hailed 2004's Crash as a masterpiece but it obviously borrowed much from Grand Canyon. The difference is that the latter is the better film. Although Crash has its merits Grand Canyon is more entertaining and has a more positive vibe.FINAL WORD Grand Canyon is a film of the most eminent order; a masterpiece.GRADE A+ "},{"Title":"Aloof, Detached, Unfocused","Date":"17 April 2012","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama","Review":" Lawrence Kasdan's Grand Canyon runs a fairly long feeling 129 min before the credits begin to roll.

They both do a good job with Kline his usual inquisitive self and she on the verge of break-down in several scenes.

Another thin character is given a side-show status played by Mary-Louise Parker supposedly having an affair. The writing and thus the tepidness of the affair is measly and a distraction. Grand Canyon is exploratory and almost philosophical at times in it's dialog especially with Kline, but characters emotions seem detached and aloof on the whole. You'd think for a movie about life, there would be more real living. Doesn't quite hit the mark but has some interesting dialog and scenes - definitely feels 90sish.

I found it very engaging, partly because I was amazed to see all these very well known actors (Steve Martin, Kevin Kline, etc.) in a weird little movie which apparently never made it out here to the Midwest.  I had never heard of it before.  (Admittedly, I didn't see many movies in 1991.)But I'm astonished to see someone call this a feel-good movie. It is filmed and paced as a sort of human interest thriller, a series of dramatic and shocking events with no common element but brutality.  Whenever any of the characters is alone, anywhere outside or even in their homes, something bad always happens they are assaulted, stabbed, shot, robbed, threatened with violence, whatever (you start to wonder why anyone would want to live in Los Angeles).  Any delay is only used to raise the tension level.Pretty soon everything, including the hollowly happy scenes, has a sinister, ominous cast to it.  Evil and chaos are portrayed as ever-present and ever-threatening. Attempts to do good or be friendly are portrayed as clumsy, selfish or pointless, and resulting in even more unhappiness (and the characters in the movie are, almost without exception, very unhappy people). When a maniac is shown taking over a city bus and machine-gunning the driver and passengers, we take it for granted that it's part of the plot, rather than a scene from an over-the-top movie-within-a-movie.The canyon of the title is referenced gloomily as a metaphor for how little difference the affairs of humans make in the scheme of things.  I'm kind of glad I missed the happy ending, which must have been really ludicrous, like a big smile painted on the face of a corpse.I'd call Grand Canyon a feel-bad movie.

I heard it had a good message to deliver. This film is a heavy hitter and was not easy for me to watch. But even though it started out very dark, it ended up being very bright and hopeful. It's a wonderful fantasy of course.The first thing you see in the film is a Police helicopter(a constant image/symbol in this film) flying around Los Angeles. Letting you know first off that crime is about. Then one by one you are introduced to the characters and how each of them are being effected by crime and indifference. You have Kevin Kline coming home from a game and driving through the bad section of town and running into a gang. He is saved by Danny Glover. Soon Kevin is trying to show his thanks to him by doing good deeds. Kevin should have been doing good deeds to his wife, the lovely and underrated Mary McDonnell. He has been bopping around with his assistant Mary Louise Parker. She tells her friend, Alfre Woodard, how he is just using her. Kline sees Woodard and puts her together on a blind date with Glover. Glover's sister has two kids who live in a bad part of town and Kline helps them out. That's just a taste of what is going on without giving too much away.The film is saying that we must make an effort to stop crime from taking over our lives. By making an effort to help one another, we can make a difference in the world. The storyline and the actors makes everything believable, although I just can't stomach the Kline-Parker tryst. If Kline's character has such a turn around, why does he still persist with using Parker? How could he use her when McDonnell is SO much more attractive and sweeter than Parker? Other than that, everything else though is perfect. Let us not forget Steve Martin who put in a subtle but very effective role. If you don't mind being preached to, this is a good film to enjoy.

The 4 scenes I originally wasn't supposed to watch at that time were not as terrible as they look. It is indeed the Big Chill of the 90's but it also made me think a tiny bit of ensemble cast movies like Valentine's Day and What to Expect when You're Expecting. The flying scene that Mack (Kevin) is dreaming about was my absolute favorite scene of all. It made me think of when I traveled to Hollywood and visited the Chinese Theater. I actually went there to see Kevin's star there. This was where I admire Mary-Louise Parker and Alfre Woodard from.

I think what is most impressive is that you have multiple stories, each of which could have been a film it's their own right, but they are woven together into a tapestry of the philosophy that we are all interconnected.First you have the married couple Kevin Kline and Mary McDonnell, who are having a bit of a mid-life crisis (although saying crisis is an exaggeration...more of a bump), when she finds a baby left in the thicket while she is out jogging. Meanwhile, Kline is saved from a night time ghetto incident by a tow truck driver (Danny Glover). Glover is no longer married, and Kline introduced him to a single Black woman (Alfrie Woodard). And, Kline helps move Glover's sister and two children into a better neighborhood than their previous gang-infested one. While Kline's son (Jeremy Sisto) is adjusting well to life, Glover's nephew (Patrick Malone) isn't, and is torn to go back to the gangbangers he once knew.All of the stories work , except on -- movie director Steve Martin. This part of the puzzle never quite seems to gel, unless it is a device to get other characters to be able to verbalize what they are experiencing.In terms of the acting, Kevin Kline is very good, as usual, although here (as often), he essentially played Kevin Kline...but it works! I'm simply not a fan of Danny Glover, but I must admit that his performance here is just right for the story. Mary McDonnell is one of those actresses whose name is unfamiliar to most, yet she consistently turns in fine performances...as here. It isn't that Steve Martin's performance is below standard...it's the part that is the problem. Alfre Woodard is charming, as always. Jeremy Sisto does a nice job as the son. Patrick Malone is very good as the ghetto-torn son! I was a tad bit disappointed in the very ending. What exactly is so special about the Grand Canyon to the story?

In this film there are four important characters that experience life changing events and each of these events either directly or indirectly affects another character in the film. The first character, Mack (Kevin Kline), ends up stranded in a poor neighborhood and is confronted by a street gang. The second character, Davis (Steve Martin), is shot in the leg by a man that is trying to take his Rolex wristwatch. The third character, Claire (Mary McDonnell), finds an abandoned infant on her morning jog. The fourth character, Simon (Danny Glover), finally finds love after being divorced for many years. The Grand Canyon National Park, becomes a metaphor for the theme of the film; that no matter how insignificant and out of control people may sometimes feel, they are still capable of bridging the gaps in their lives. All of the characters prove that despite their circumstances, they are able to find what they have been searching for all along. The focus of the film's theme is on mixed emotions. Another film with a similar type of theme would be The Royal Tenenbaums (Anderson, 2001); another story with several important characters whose personal experiences and actions are interconnected with other character's lives. In addition to the national park being conveyed as a metaphor to the film's theme, it is also used as a motif; being referenced several times throughout the film. The very first instance the national park is mentioned is actually on a television set. The second time it is referenced is when Mack and Simon are talking at the garage just after having towed Mack's car. Simon mentions that, after having seen the Grand Canyon up close one can really get a feel of just how small you really are in the world and how the events in your life are just little parts of a bigger picture. The reference to the national park not only highlights the metaphor being used but also foreshadows the ending of the story; that Mack will finally get to see the Grand Canyon.The cinematographer uses the objective point of view to convey depth in the film. One specific example of the use of the objective point of view is when Mack's car dies on a vacant street in a poor neighborhood; the camera is angled high with a clear view of the vacant street, Mack and his car, and the car being driven by a street gang that, soon confronts Mack and harasses him to get him out of his car. The depth of emotion that develops from the use of this type of camera angle also supports the mixed emotion theme of the film; it provides suspense and excitement while the viewer wonders what will happen next.I really enjoyed watching The Grand Canyon. Life is mysterious and full of devastating experiences and sometimes it is comforting to know that other people live in chaos too. The mixed emotions theme that was portrayed in the film is so realistic to the emotions people feel in everyday life. One moment life can make you feel the best you have ever felt and yet, in only a matter of seconds you could feel as though you have lost everything you have ever known. This film had a beautiful storyline and despite the clear visual indications of the era in which it was produced, the theme is unmistakably universal. Life will always be unpredictable.

Many reviewers here have called this underrated in fact, it is underwhelming. If Grand Canyon were really all the things its admirers claimed it was it would be far better than the film it actually is. Its somber tones and earnest observations provide a coating of weighty significance over a rusting hunk of zero. There are no revelations here, no great insights into the human condition, just the illusion of something stirring.Fans of Grand Canyon argue that those who see through its pretense are insufficiently sensitive to appreciate the movie's philosophical merits. But any truly perceptive observer will spot the film's obvious contradictions and glory in its unintentionally humorous aspects. One character states, When you sit on the edge of (the Grand Canyon) you realize what a joke we people really are... what big heads we have thinking that what we do is gonna matter all that much... thinking that our time here means (nothing) to those rocks &#x85; Those rocks are laughing at me right now, me and my worries. If this is so, then why should any of the principles even bother going to the trouble of contemplating all that they pretend to contemplate? And why should anyone watching this sop give a damn about anyone in this film that strives so hard to make you care? Essentially, the Grand Canyon is meant to be a metaphor for the chasm that exists between people; between perceptions and reality, but if you listen carefully to how the characters express this, the Grand Canyon becomes more an allegory about the abyss within people who talk about the existence of miracles without daring to contemplate their source.The characters are familiar Kevin Kline is the feckless white (liberal) dope so feeble that he is rescued from the potentially fatal consequences of his own lame-brained actions twice. Danny Glover is the Magic Negro. Mary McDonald is the wise wife who obeys the voices she hears emitting from a mute homeless man. Naturally, Grand Canyon is set in Los Angeles and features attorneys and film producers who veer into the paths of wrecker drivers.Grand Canyon appeals to a particular kind of sucker, the kind that prefers to believe in a poetic truth conjured in his own mind than the literal one staring him in the face; the kind of people who confuse style and substance. That so many of them have posted positive reviews of the film does not surprise me, what does are the many who claim it moved them to tears. Really? Cussing was inserted into the dialog so that viewers knew that they weren't watching some warmed over Hallmark Channel offering.

We keep a perspective. We are pretty insignificant and our problems are insignificant in the grand scheme of things.We take it as it comes and deal with it. No, I don't buy the miracle thing that appears to be a thread in this film, but we have to be open to things that can and do happen and just go with it.We also have to keep our eye on the bigger picture as Davis (Steve Martin) tells Mack The point is there's a gulf in this country; an ever-widening abyss between the people who have stuff, and the people who don't have sh*t.

The film version of VANITIES was so disastrous, it left the field open for GRAND CANYON and CRASH to take the same basic idea and run with it.

Later a different character is talking about the time he sat on the rim of the Grand Canyon, and became super aware how insignificant his little life is and how short his time on Earth is, when he saw the grandeur of that canyon. And yet a different reference by a different character, about the gulf between the wealthy and the poor, it is like a Grand Canyon. This movie examines many of the types of things that happen in real life, with real people, and especially those of us who have lived more than 30 or 40 years can especially identify with the story and the characters. Good movie, with some of my favorite actors -- Glover, Cline, Martin. The critic Ebert has a very complete review.SPOILERS, for my own recollection. Quit reading, OK!?  A main theme here is whether things happen for a reason. Cline's character earlier in life was pulled back to the walkway to avoid stepping into the path of a bus, but the stranger, a woman with a nice smile, he let walk away never to see her again. He muses to Glover at breakfast, 'Was she a real person? Maybe she was sent -- from 'somewhere' -- for a reason.' An angel, perhaps? He is a big Steelers fan, she was wearing a Steelers cap. Having let her go, he didn't want to do the same with the tow truck driver who saved him from the gang of punks. They eventually became friends, starting with breakfast together, and later playing one-on-one basketball. Same with the baby his wife found while jogging. She believed it was sent for a reason, their son was almost grown, but they arranged to adopt this abandoned baby, and he terminated his brief romantic spell with his assistant who took a job elsewhere. He and his wife had a renewed love for each other. The movie ends with most of the characters standing together on the rim of the Grand Canyon, only a 9-hour drive from L.A.

This movie, about rich and poor people in Los Angeles whose lives intertwine, all discussing their own philosophies of life, takes the pretentious nasal-gazing gold medal. Lawrence Kasdan, who's written and directed modern classics like SILVERADO and THE BIG CHILL (and wrote the script to THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK based on George Lucas's story), penned this do-gooder doozy with his wife, Meg. Kevin Kline's car breaks down in Inglewood (after a Laker game) and is almost killed by gangsters; Danny Glover, as a tow truck driver, saves him; they become friends and we follow each of their (and their friends and families) lives and basically learn we're in different sized boats in the same raging sea. Hollywood bigwigs with tons of money obviously have a lotta guilt, and the Kasdans probably wrote this to assure their diamond-studded cronies No matter if we're millionaires, at least WE care.

Both are really the same in many ways, Crash is a little better of a movie than Grand Canyon in the way that it's presented, and because of the more profound moments that are presented in it(Crash). But honestly Grand Canyon is just as good. Crash just happened to be made at the height of political correctness, at the height of the Al Sharpton era, ergo Crash wins the Academy Award for Best Picture where as Grand Canyon only gets an Academy Award Nomination for Best Screenplay. Times were different when Grand Canyon came out in 1991 then when Crash came out in 2005(Plus I don't think the Academy wanted to see a Homosexual Cowboy Lovestory win best film, even though we all know, It's 10 times better of a film than Crash is, that movie being Brokeback Mountain of course). I won't really get much into Grand Canyon because if you've seen Crash, then it's all said right there. Lot's of Concepts, lot's of things being said that are contrived, etc, etc. One thing I will touch on though is the best scene in the movie Grand Canyon. The best scene in Grand Canyon is with Jeremy Sisto's character and Kevin Kline's character, Kline is Sisto's father in the film. Kline is teaching Sisto how to drive and Sisto makes a big boo boo while driving and they almost get in a big car crash, but they don't and Kline patiently tells Sisto to pull over. I think this is a scene that is greatly over looked. I know with my dad, he would have been yelling and screaming at me if I almost got in a car accident. And as we don't want to be push-overs to our kids, there needs to be a balance, a moderation. What's brilliant about the scene is it speaks volumes about Kline's character as a father. Sisto's character in the movie, is a smart, kind- hearted kid, with a good head on his shoulder. Kline's character isn't a hot head, he's very calm and patient, but no push-over either, and that's why Sisto has such a good head on his shoulder and doesn't overly stress out ever because he's been raised with very good parents. They say kids pick things up mentally for the rest of their life between the ages of 6-8 years old. I know when my dad yelled at me for doing something wrong that i hadn't learned yet between the ages of 6-8 years old, later in life, I have always stressed out if i do something wrong, and I always expect to be yelled at. Not a good feeling to feel nor should one feel the need to feel that way. It's obvious that Kline's character never yelled at his son like my dad did when Sisto's character was between 6-8 years old because if Kline's character had, that scene in the car with Sisto almost crashing it, would have gone down with Kline's character castigating Sisto and Sisto stressing out with sadness, anger, resentment, that leads on to things later in life with always feeling you have to be perfect, feeling like you can't make a mistake or you'll get yelled at, walking on eggshells, and then perhaps leading further down the road in life to anger management and PTSS, you name it. That stuff messes up kids. Not saying Kline's character is husband of the year, he has an affair in the movie, and he's quite lucky his wife and kid(Sisto) didn't find out or that could have had catastrophic effects on both his wife and son, but other than that mistake, Kline's character is a good husband and a great father. If nothing else from this movie, I think we can all learn to be better parents, to raise our kids better in a more constructive manner than in a reactive manner after watching this film. Also, Steve Martin is terrific in this one as well, and Danny Glover is always likable, perhaps one of the most likable actors in history. If you liked Crash, you'll like this one, if you didn't, then you might or might not like this one.

With the exception of Short Cuts, these films tend to be very contrived, filled with strained connections and spending much of their time making laboured points about fate, fragility, coincidence and the interconnectedness of life.Though better written than its imitators, Grand Canyon does the same thing. Set in Los Angeles, the film glides gracefully across a set of characters, all of whom share common experiences despite their different economic strata, ages and racial backgrounds. Though at times unfocused, the film is ambitious and contains a number of well written sequences, including one in which actor Kevin Kline describes the moment a stranger saved his life. Another scene, in which a father and son share a driving lesson, is particularly beautiful. It points to life's precariousness, the way every mundane activity carries with it both risk and bravery, as well as the infinite number of little miracles which occur everyday.On another level, Canyon is a white, middle-class, suburban disaffection movie in the vein of American Beauty, The Ice Storm, Safe, Far From Heaven and Happiness, most of which were released in the mid 90s. Canyon, however, predates them all, and is resolutely upbeat. Where those films tend to end in violence, disillusionment and disaffection Canyon ends on a note of almost naive optimism. And while most of these films focus on a white, middle class, Canyon jumps from the staggeringly rich, to the middle class, to ghetto-trapped African Americans. Another distinction is Kasadan's direction itself, which isn't afraid to drop into surreal territory. The film includes several extended dream sequences, one of which recalls the Coens' Big Lebowski, another LA flick.Canyon indulges in two recurring metaphors or motifs, that of The Grand Canyon and that of permanently patrolling helicopters, the latter resembling the med fly aircraft of Altman's Short Cuts. Kasdan's point man is utterly inconsequential when stacked up against a universe that is simultaneously vast, beautiful, horrific, malevolent and seemingly time-less. Elsewhere Kasdam's patrol helicopters offer a mixed sense of guilt, danger and perhaps cosy communal safety, the world presumed dangerous, but rendered navigable alongside the watchful eyes, or even miracles, of others.Canyon isn't as good as Short Cuts, but it is better than all the other ensemble movies and disaffection dramas that came later. In terms of flaws, all of Kasdan's characters speak the same, regardless of their economic standing. The film is also at times very heavy handed, condescending and has that typically overproduced look of early 90s Hollywood.7.9/10 &#x96; There are a number of great scenes here, but the film can't sustain these highs. Worth one viewing.

Set in 1990s Los Angeles, it follows the fortunes of half a dozen citizens whose lives are intertwined by fate and fortune. There are some memorable scenes that will live long in the memory. Take Kevin Kline being rescued by pick up truck driver Danny Glover when he breaks down in one of the most undesirable neighbourhoods around. I found that the first half of the movie rolled along at a cracking pace and was watchable, even though many of those scenes were laden with doom and gloom and the chaos theory that we all live through in every day life. Indeed, Kasdan seemed to relish every single opportunity to tell us that modern day life - especially in LA - is fraught with danger, despair, injustice and anguish. After a while, the message gets laborious, but Kasdan then shows us that despite all that, we cannot cheat fate and that there are immeasurable pleasures to be had in life despite the surface appearing to be rotten and hard. The ending is a little too neat and doesn't sit kindly after what has been shown before, and the second half of the picture does start to sag, but all in all this is a decent movie well worth a revisit. Not sure what Steve Martin is doing here - he seems hopelessly miscast in a straight role, but Kline and Glover, in particular, are excellent.

Still, the directors made their points and the points work and provoke thought, and LA just barely makes it as a microcosm for the various things that are wrong with the world; so perhaps we give credit where credit is due and leave it at that. The two Raymonds -- Chandler and Carver -- always did see LA accurately, if through a darkened lens, one that LA deserves. And yes, as in Grand Canyon, sometimes, perhaps often, you need to leave LA and see the rest of the country, or world, to get real perspective and genuine hope ... something those of us who live between the coasts already know, unfortunately for Angelenos.

What The bonfire of the vanities says about New York is merely echoed by the main thrust of Grand Canyon's sentiments.Racial and social politics appear to dominate life in both those cities.Here in the U.K.,those who just want to get along are polarised in their respective communities and generally manage to get along by steadfastly ignoring each other.This may be a peculiarly British solution to a problem i.e. pretend there isn't one. In the 17 years since the movie was made I doubt if the rich of L.A. have become poorer or the poor richer.If the movie's purpose was to somehow help redress that imbalance then it has,sadly,failed in that purpose. If,as I rather suspect,its purpose was to engender debate on the inequities and vagaries of life by taking the larger view,the general rather than the specific,then it has succeeded very well indeed.

There are many other movies of lesser quality getting 7 or more stars.Now to be honest, my memory of the specifics of this movie are a little vague and I don't criticize movies for being too sappy or for things like rehashing themes that others have done. I figure if the movie can make me laugh and cry all in the same movie, it is a great movie. I think this one did.I find movies like this superior to say a Tarentino movie or a movie full of special effects. I want a movie to SAY something. I want it to touch me deeply, and not just get a cheap rise out of me.

I just didn't think Crash quite spoke the kind of truth this movie did. One of my favorite rock albums of all time is Pink Floyd's The Wall which is very dark in its message. I only listen to it once in a while because I don't like to dwell on the negative -- Crash could have been on a par - unfortunately, I can't put my finger on the reason, but it didn't achieve that level of truth for me.Long story short...

Steve Martin doesn't provide much humor here, either -- so don't let Kline's and Martin's names make you think this film has a lot of madcap funny moments in it. They're not supposed to be funny here; they're playing against type.The Grand Canyon makes a fine example of what an epic film can be -- which is visionary. We see a vast sweep of characters, of landscape. A sense of history emerges, when these things work well. Most people don't look for that at the theaters, or make a mockery of visionary work because being a naysayer carries a certain cachet.So, yes, the main Grand Canyon you see here is the troubled quality, or just plain misery of many different people in and around Los Angeles. The emptiness of their lives -- empty in feeling, but full of activity, in many cases -- that's kind of the essence. The city skyscrapers and urban squalor, the rapid pace of change, escalating violence and the common sense of alienation -- all these make the characters feel like they're near the bottom of a great canyon of spiritual emptiness.I've seen the film at least twice, will probably enjoy renting it at least once every four or five years.

Everything about Grand Canyon is competent (with the exception of James Newton Howard's godawful music score), yet the film itself doesn't satisfy, doesn't leave any impressions of its own. The screenplay, occasionally barbed but still neat and tidy, compresses various situations and predicaments into little boxes; it isn't pretentious so much as it is naive. Danny Glover's working-class driver (named Simon!) is literate and big-hearted, communicating daily with his deaf daughter, able to show a gal a good time, talking in a whispery-solemn voice as if he were the Patron Saint of Towers--yet, we never see him break a sweat.

The Grand Canyon scene in the end, which lasts only a couple minutes, is not enough to redeem that feeling.  As someone else commented, this movie is not so deep.  So, the Grand Canyon is supposed to make all our problems look small?  Who says?  The Grand Canyon is big... compared to what?  The human body?  So what?  Let's not mix up new age with spiritual.  This film definitely might appeal to the new age crowd.  But the new age movement is all surface, shallow, hope masquerading as spirituality.  The truly spiritual is timeless, utterly beyond our superficial personalities, hopes, fears and problems.  It is not reached by a moment of looking at a canyon and a tiny glimpse at how meaningless our petty lives are compared to its size.  It's reached by dedicating one's life to going beyond the petty concerns of the ego.  True spirituality lies in attaining a lasting peace of mind able to deal easily with life's circumstances, letting what comes come, and letting what goes, go.  It has to do with overcoming desire, clinging and attachment, especially attachment to the comfortable, self-enclosed little bubbles of fear and desire most of us live in.  It's not about making friends with other such bubbles, it's about dissolving the bubble.  A glimpse of the Grand Canyon and how it relates to life is shallow spiritual commentary, indeed.  6/10.

Nominated for an Oscar for best screenplay, the film is about how our interactions with others, those we know and those we meet for the first time, can help us to see the world in a different light. As one reviewer put it, It (Grand Canyon) is a healing film about the power of listening, truly listening to one another. A terrific ensemble cast that includes Kevin Kline, Steve Martin, Sarah Jessica parker, Mary McDonnell, Danny Glover, Alfrie Woodard, and Jeremy Sisto carries the film and makes it come alive. A few of the memorable scenes include Kevin Kline's car breaking down in a ghetto area near Inglewood, California and, after being harassed by a gang of hoodlums, being aided by a fearless tow-truck driver (Glover); the absolute terror felt by Kevin Kline in giving his 15-year-old son (Jeremy Sisto) driving lessons on a busy L.A. street, Mary McDonnell hearing a baby's cries while jogging and taking it home, telling her husband that the child needs a new mother.I re-watched Grand Canyon after discussing it on the message board and seeing it again for the first time in many years got me back in touch with how inspiring this film is for me. While the dream sequences feel unnecessary and some of the connections may be a bit strained, on the whole it is a very honest film that tells the truth, without sentimentality, about how we are a part of the miracle of all life, big ones like the Grand Canyon, and small ones of friendship, love, and giving of yourself to others.

This movie is like an overview of all the issues we're faced with in Los Angeles and in today's society in general. You can breakdown each issue and make movies about each one of them but I really liked how this film ties all of them together into a structured storyline.Issues such as unnecessary gang violence, marriage problems, getting older, motherhood and kids growing up, bad neighborhoods, babies being left to die on the side of the road, cheating husbands, racial relationships, white families, homelessness, spoiled Hollywood producers, psychological therapy, driving in LA, going to a hospital for a tiny finger cut, human kindness, the LA earthquakes, etc.Societal structures and issues, like the Grand Canyon, can go from one extreme to the other. But, just by mentioning and talking about the issues, means that the film is already affecting those issues it raises. Everything in the script has a greater connotation than the storyline itself. I really admire clever scripts like this. This is a story about life more than anything else. In a sense it is a satire on life. Towards the end of the film Davis (Steve Martin) says to Mack (Kevin Kline) that all of life's questions are answered in the movies. This film raises more questions than answers but it does use the beauty of nature to justify optimism and hope for our society. Simon (Danny Glover) mentions to Mack that all of societal issues seem like a joke when you're faced with the vastness of nature. The film has a spectacular visual ending on the 'grand' scheme of things, with an underlying message, the way films (a visual medium) were meant to be.

The direction of Kasdan (the only subtle thing in this film) and the great cast make this a decent movie, but not one you'd want to see more than once.  This could have been a study of problems in the L.A. and how the people who live there deal with them.  Instead the only cast member missing was Sally Struthers, whining about how for only the price of a cup of coffee, you could move a down-on-their-luck ethnic family into a nice, wholesome, white neighborhood, find true love in the strangest places, and save abandoned children from becoming statistics.Start off with a WASPy lawyer living in comfy digs who takes a wrong turn into *gasp* a black neighborhood!  Oh no!  And of course, the denizens of this terrible place move in for the kill, but as luck would have it, a (black) knight in shining armor comes to save Rich White Guy, who in turn feels compelled to improve the knight's horribly lonely life.

French Kiss was... alright everyone has their down cycles, but nothing for Kasdan (IMHO) has been as down as Grand Canyon, a film with a hand as heavy as a black hole.This film addresses Important Issues and Contemporary Themes, the sort of things that an average L.A.'er has to deal with every day.  There is a Grand Canyon between people because of their differences (race, ethics, class) and if only people would make more connections and open themselves up to caring and trust, it wouldn't be such a hard world.Look, I have no problem with the sentiment of this film.  I think it has a lot of good things to say, but why couldn't he just say them with a little less Symbolism and a little more storytelling.  The characters are all pretty half-baked and stereotypical Kline is a hot-shot L.A. lawyer, McDonnell is a new-agey L.A. wife, Glover is a blue-collar L.A. tow truck operator, Martin is a sleazy L.A. movie producer.  Yes, it's an L.A. world out there, Kasdan tells us, but maybe if he could have stepped outside the confines of the city of angels for two seconds or perhaps cut the cast by half, his vision could have been much more efficient and less cluttered. But what do I know, I'm a shlub from Western New York, I don't know L.A.There has been much talk on this message board of hope and feel-goodness, but as the film goes, none of the hope comes as a result of choices that any of the characters make.  Yes, at the end, the principal characters all look with awe over the spectacle of the Grand Canyon and are given a realization of the chasm between them, and that their diversity is important, but where did that come from?  All the events of occur serendipitously to the characters (McDonnell finds a baby, Kline meets a kindly black person, Parker gets a glowing recommendation from former boss Kline, Woodard is in the right place at the right time, Martin is shot by a mugger in an unconvincing scene), and the good fortune these people experience are more the result of chance than of good judgment or moral struggle.  I would be more impressed if each character had a dilemma (a real dilemma, between two opposite choices with real consequences, not just whether to adopt or whether to fix two people up on a date) and goodness came out of those rather than out of some mystical happenstance or some benevolent lifeforce (like the otherwise meaningless homeless man/Christ figure).Kasdan, I love ya babe.
