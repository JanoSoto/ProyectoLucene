[{"Title":"Chelsom's Song","Date":"2 May 2004","Score":"11 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Music","Review":" I don't think Peter Chelsom's appreciation will grow much today, with audiences and critics more inclined to pyrotechnics, flamboyant styles and cynic approach to mankind's troubles. Chelsom is a skilled filmmaker, but for today's tastes his cinema seems too close to the audience's soft hearts, and that is probably his less attractive trait. I like a few of his movies The Mighty, Serendipity as predictable as it is, and my favorites Funny Bones and Hear My Song which he also wrote. Both deal with a search and possess a frenetic and funny approach to human foibles, and in this case an enthusiastic leading character, as played by Adrian Dunbar who also co-wrote. He is a nightclub administrator who keeps cheating on his patrons, bringing mediocre artists to perform. When he brings a fake tenor who humiliates his future mother-in-law (Shirley-Ann Field, who had an affair with the real tenor), he embarks on the almost impossible finding the real singer, who cannot step on Irish soil due to tax evasion. Ned Beatty gives the performance of his life (and that's a lot to say) as the singer, leading the story to a moving conclusion.

He then sets forth on an odyssey to Ireland to find the real Joseph Locke, bring him back to London, save the theater, and win back the girl. Of course, the whole point of every epic quest from Homer on down is for the hero to finally realize why he left in the first place (this realization occurs while Dunbar is dangled off the side of a very high cliff). The cast is amazing, especially David McCallum as a police inspector obsessed with capturing Locke, and Ned Beatty gives a very credible and warmhearted performance as Joseph Locke (although the singing is dubbed). The Irish countryside is breathtaking--as is Tara Fitzgerald--and the story is great fun in the tradition of Local Hero and Eat the Peach.

The characters are witty and warm and likeable.  It's quirky and some times the plot is hard to follow, but again, the characters are so real and likeable, they draw you in.  Then there's the music.  I never knew I liked Irish tenors until I saw this movie.  The only truly confusing thing is that it is hard to tell when the movie is set.  It seems almost timeless and yet there is a definite timeframe referred to in the film.  Adrian Dunbar is a wonderful actor and carries the film along, although Ned Beatty succeeds in stealing it half-way through!  Tara Fitzgerald is underutilized as the romantic cause of the hero's journey, but does well with what she's given.  The actor who plays the hero's friend is also quite wonderful.

He displays a real feel for the characters, and the small details which give the film its sense of authenticity.  The leading actors are excellent, particularly Ned Beatty, who gives the performance of his career, but they have to compete with a host of colorful minor characters.  Give it a look.

Great scenery. Excellent acting. Great music. Tara Fitzgerald unclothed. Well, Tara's nude scene was less than germane to the plot, though I think she's totally yummy. Ned Beatty actually pulled the role of Jo Locke off quite well, not going over the top trying to lay on the old Irish brogue bit too heavy. The Locke vocals were sung by Vernon Midgely, & since I had never heard music like that before, I was knocked out. The trad Irish diddly-diddly tunes in the soundtrack are by Patrick Street, one of the best contemp Irish bands you can find. Adrian Dunbar, who co-wrote the screenplay with author Peter Chelsom, was wonderful, as semi-crooked music hall manager Mickey O'Neill. Tara Fitzgerald portrayed Nancy Doyle, O'Neill's fiancee, & brings the role off very well. James Nesbitt, who may be known from Ballykissangel, plays O'Neill's best friend back in Ireland. Shirley Anne Field, one of Britain's true beauties of the 60's, plays Fitzgerald's mother, a flame left behind by Beatty's Jo Locke, when he left England as a tax exile in the '50's. I just wish we could get a Director's Cut here in the States, as the US theatrical & video releases list actors(Brian Flanagan as Young Mickey, Constane Cowley as Nurse, and Marie Mullen as Mickey's Mum) in the credits which for some inexplicable reason were cut from the North American release. This scene has to do with why Mickey O'Neill can't tell someone he loves them(i.e. Tara Fitzgerald as Nancy). Rumour has it Hear My Song will be re-released on DVD in the UK in July '09....but a US release is still delayed so DVD makers can press more boxed sets of Dog, The Bounty Hunter, anime, and Hannah Montana(whose movie was actually directed by Peter Chelsom, who directed and wrote Hear My Song) Still, this is a wonderful movie, "},{"Title":"This film's plot is a work of fiction based on the very real Josef Locke, one of Ireland's greatest tenors.","Date":"7 March 2002","Score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Music","Review":"  Micky O'Neill, a sleazy Irish entertainment promoter has about run his course offering pseudo-acts like Franc Cinatra.

So Micky is given a reprieve until it becomes known that the Josef Locke he has booked is a fraud,  Since his girlfriend's mother once had a fling with Jo and has been duped by the fake Jo, Micky has been outcast by the Ryan family, his girlfriend and especially his girlfriend's mother.  He hops a ride on a boat to Ireland where he meets up with his friend Fintan, a concert promoter, and the two of them ride through the Irish countryside in search of the real Josef Locke in an effort to convince him to return to England to perform.  When they find him, the Irish comedy really begins, and also the Irish singing.  The tenor voice is spectacular and when Jo sings, women weep.......

I screeched with laughter, and cried real tears. The audience reception was rapturous, one of the most responsive I've ever witnessed at the festival. Director Peter Chelsom was reduced to tears, and when Ned Beatty made a surprise appearance in his Joseph Locke fedora and cloak the crowd went crazy. Since then, I make a point of watching this wonderful film in the dark days of February, the dreariest part of a Toronto winter. It never fails to restore my spirit. As a final note, I think Chelsom is a very talented director. Who can ever forget the image of those Irish lady owners crammed onto one couch? The film is filled with glorious visuals like this one. I've liked every movie Chelsom has made since, but he seems to get a bum rap from the press. Nonetheless, he will always be remembered for giving us this treasure.

A lovely whimsical plot, painting a picture of Irish fantasy, fairies and all, over the true life background of a great singer. And a beautiful soundtrack featuring original Locke recordings reminds us of just how moving a pure tenor voice can be. Who on earth needs techno and rap?None of the other correspondents has yet picked up on the fact that Josef Locke (born Joseph McLaughlin 1917, died 1999) was alongside John McCormack as one of the two great Irish tenors (one correspondent has even written that he was a baritone -were you actually listening??) of the 20th century, and that he retired to rural life in Co Kildare in 1958 after the British Inland Revenue began to pursue him for large but disputed amounts of tax. That much is established fact, but this story of his comeback performance and the events surrounding it is indeed fantasy, with a happy feelgood ending. But what's so wrong with that? I like to be entertained, and unlike your more dismal correspondents I don't need to be intellectually challenged to thoroughly enjoy a movie. Nine out of ten, and I thought seriously about giving it ten as a gesture of eternal devotion to the stunningly beautiful Tara.

Such imagination went into it.  The film tells its story really well.  The way in which the imitation Joseph Locke is discovered in the first half of the film forced me to hit stop, and go to the bathroom, because I laughed so hard I almost peed myself.   All the major characters are wonderful, and the minor characters are better.  When Beatty finally does appear as the real Locke, his star quality takes the entire cast to an even higher level.  I can't say more without taking some of the fun away from you.  Also, old Man From Uncle co-star, David McCallum, is marvelous in his small supporting role.  Very amusing film with surprising twists and turns and an incredible amount of whimsy.

Hear my song tells of the search by a cut- price impresario for the elusive Irish tenor.Like The Commitments it presents the Irish as they really are rather than how the Americans choose to portray them - as refugees from a John Ford movie. Ned Beatty is splendid as the reluctant recluse, a man still capable of charming the birds out of the trees.He has the voice of an angel - so he does.My personal favourite Miss Shirley Anne Field makes a very welcome appearance,and the circle is closed by Mr Harold Behrens in a small role rounding off the connection to post - war BBC radio where he was a regular on Ignorance is Bliss. Appearing unheralded on the horizon out of nowhere - as it were - Hear my Song is a beautifully crafted little film,a masterpiece in miniature and anyone whose love for movies is more than skin deep will adore it.

Unfortunately, her role is little more than that, as Dunbar is the star.When you mention Irish tenors, people immediately think of Finbar Wright, Anthony Kearns, and Ronan Tynan. But long before, there was Joseph McLaughlin, better known as Josef Locke. This film is loosely based upon his life.It really gets funny as Micky O'Neill (Dunbar) goes broke trying to fake everyone out with Franc Cinatra, and then with a Mister X, who pretends to be Locke, and goes chasing around Ireland to find the real Josef Locke and bring him back to England.

Maybe it makes a difference that the film was made on the far side of the Atlantic Ocean, but it succeeds as a genuinely charming and disarming romantic comedy without the expected formula plotting or trendy visual hype, and (perhaps not surprisingly) without the box office benefit of brand name stars. The climax is somewhat overwrought, but by then director Peter Chelsum is working from a surplus of good-natured blarney and local brogue, with some gorgeous Irish scenery added almost as an afterthought.
