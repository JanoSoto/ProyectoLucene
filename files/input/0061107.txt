I don't know if I could get away with saying it's one of Hitchcock's ten best features, but I found it to be easily one of his top ten most entertaining. I enjoyed watching Torn Curtain a lot more than some of his established classics, like Notorious and the Birds, even if it's not quite as psychologically complex as those films.The main thing about Torn Curtain is the photography. It's full of pretty pictures--one of the most beautifully filmed of all Hitchcock's films, with lots bold swaths of primary colors and attractive and constantly changing locations--some scenes look like they were shot on location, while others are wonderfully artificial studio creations, and they're blended together perfectly. Another cool thing about Torn Curtain is that it's constantly on the move. It never stagnates. The pacing is deliberate, but engaging. It's well-plotted and suspenseful. It's full of fantastic little directorial touches, like the scene where Paul Newman ducks into a bathroom to read his secret spy message. Hitchcock never shows us the room. He keeps the camera tight on Paul Newman, so we can't tell who or what might be in that room with us, just out of frame. It's totally simple, but it creates a highly effective feeling of uneasiness and paranoia. This movie also features one of the strangest and best-filmed death scenes I've ever seen. Hitchcock was still on top of his game here.Most of the bad reviews for Torn Curtain seem to focus on the acting. I don't know why. A lot of people bash Julie Andrews just for being Julie Andrews, and that hardly seems fair. Typecasting sucks. And while I wouldn't say she turned in one of the most memorable and overpowering performances of all time, her role didn't call for that. Torn Curtain wasn't a complex character study, it was a plot-based thriller. And Julie Andrews was perfectly adequate for that, even pretty good when she was given a chance to be.Paul Newman was perfect. He wasn't his usual charming self here. He was grim and tight-lipped and stiff--as would be appropriate for a scientist feeling out of his league, playing a spy in a hostile country, having to pretend to be a traitor--a role which he found objectionable--all with his girlfriend annoyingly tagging along and complicating everything. I understand that Paul Newman found working for Hitchcock objectionable. It makes me wonder if Hitch deliberately made life unpleasant for Paul just to get this kind of tooth-gritting performance from him. Whatever, Hitch and Paul were both great.And so was this film.

I've watched it in its entirety more than once since then.  It's difficult not to conclude that the master director's age was beginning to take its toll by 1966.  It could have been a great film except for some major flaws.First, the main characters.  Newman and Andrews look distinctly ill-at-ease and their acting is wooden.  There is very nearly no chemistry between them, and viewers are not really drawn into their somewhat implausible situation.  Both actors are compelling in other films, but for some reason not in this one.Second, Hitchcock would have done better to keep his villains' identity less specific.  In The Lady Vanishes, The Thirty-nine Steps, and North by Northwest, the identity of the foreign agents is left deliberately vague and thus little plausibility need be attached to their actions.  Here they are East German communists, of which we know rather a lot.Third, there are inconsistencies in the plot.  At one point Newman and Andrews are forced to go out into an open space to avoid being overheard.  But in another scene a pro-western spy communicates confidential information to Newman in a hospital room, seemingly oblivious to the possibility of wiretaps.Finally, there's John Addison's score, which seems to have been written quite independently of the film's action.  A suspenseful scene is inappropriately matched with cheerful, melodic music.  Everyone knows, of course, that Hitch's longtime musical collaborator, Bernard Herrmann, wrote a mostly complete score for the film, but the two had a falling out on the set and Herrmann was dismissed.  Another example of poor judgement on Hitchcock's part.  Herrmann's score would have immeasurably improved a mediocre film.  (Look at Obsession nearly a decade later.)  With all the recent film restorations, I would love to see someone redo Torn Curtain and put in as much of Herrmann's score as the composer was able to finish.  (But perhaps there would be copyright problems.)  Had Herrmann's score been used, the murder sequence in the farmhouse might have become as famous as the shower scene in Psycho.As I was watching the protagonists flee through the East German landscape in their efforts to reach the west, I found myself thinking that, if they had only waited another twenty-three years, the wall would have come down anyway and they could simply have walked out!  That's how much their plight gripped me.

The story of a double agent and his involvement on both side of the political wall was too convoluted and too unfocused to create any real tension, any suspense, and according to accounts, Hitchcock became totally uninterested with the product. So did I on viewing this.The introductory setup is good. Michael Armstrong (Paul Newman) defects to East Germany and his girlfriend (Julie Andrews) follows. There he meets Gromek (Wolfgang Kieling) who has been sent to do away with him. Their encounter leads to one of the most excruciating murder sequences committed to celluloid, and this is by far the best part of the movie. From there on, the plot meanders and it's as if Hitchcock had decided to go on autopilot and let matters resolve themselves, most notably in a lousy theatre sequence in which Armstrong, in an escape sequence, yells Fire! into a room full of non-English speakers.That it could have been better is obvious, but I believe Hitchcock had succumbed to the times and was in his short Cold War transition in which some of his technique shows but his choice of actors and story fails. Newman and Andrews have zero chemistry together and Andrews at times doesn't seem to know why the hell she's in this movie anyway. Lila Kedrova sticks out as a sore thumb -- why would a countess of all people be panhandling for American sponsors when her diplomatic status would have her able to come to the US with no problem? A complete distraction. Snippets of the theatre sequence are interesting, as when ballerina Tamara Toumanova whirls around in dance and spots Newmann hiding among the crowd in photographic freeze-frames she pinpoints him out.Other than that this is a fairly routine effort, like the many routine efforts directors sometimes do when they're either in an unsettled period or want to buy themselves out of their contract with a studio. Hitchcock would do one more Cold War themed film, the disastrous TOPAZ, before returning to almost full form (and his English roots) in FRENZY.

He's to fake a defection in order to get close to East German scientist Ludwig Donath and find out what advances he personally has given the Soviet bloc.As he says to agent Mort Mills, he's one of the few people in the world who would know exactly what to look for. The trick is to make Donath write it down.Nice plan, except for that fact that intrepid Julie Andrews, Newman's fianc√© suspects something's up and follows him first to Copenhagen and then East Berlin. It would have run so much easier without her, but then again there would have been no film.This was Alfred Hitchcock's last star vehicle. His last three films were done with second rank players. At the time this was made Julie Andrews was fresh from Mary Poppins and had all kinds of roles offered her. I suppose she couldn't turn down a chance to appear in a Hitchcock film, but she and Newman really have no chemistry at all. I suppose Newman also wanted to work with Hitchcock.There are some good moments in Torn Curtain. The highlight easily has to be the killing of an East German security agent by Newman and Carolyn Conwell with the creative use of a gas stove. The agent is played by German actor Wolfgang Kieling and has the best role in the film. Funny how during World War II, Germans were sometimes shown as colossally stupid, Kieling is not. He's a very tough and shrewd adversary who catches on to Newman's scheme and has to be eliminated.Hitchcock also stole from himself here. The ride and Newman and Andrews take on a bus from Leipzig to East Berlin that is stage managed by David Opatoshu is ripped off from Saboteur and the bus passengers are just like the circus people in Saboteur. Good, but done before.Devoted fans of the stars and of Alfred Hitchcock will want to see Torn Curtain, others might want to for curiosity's sake.

It's natural to want to rehabilitate one or other of these, and most fans and critics, following (of course) Fran√ßois Truffaut, pick Marnie.  But the real hidden gem is Torn Curtain.People have found all manner of trivial things to complain about.  The leads, it is said, aren't Hitchcock leads.  Julie Andrews certainly isn't unlike most of Hitchcock's American actresses, she imbues her character with warmth and good sense, qualities that may well be out of place in other films - certainly they'd be out of place in Marnie - but which are needed here.  And Paul Newman is as convincing and sympathetic a Hitchcock hero as any other.  ANY other, including my personal favourite, Robert Donat.  It's hard not to like Jimmy Stewart and Cary Grant, but (this cannot be denied) for some reason they're never at their best in Hitchcock films.  Paul Newman is.Then there's the score - everyone has to take turns sinking their boots into the musical score.  Yes, it's not by Bernard Herrmann.  Yes, Bernard Herrmann was unceremoniously dumped from the project.  Yes, Bernard Herrmann was one of Hollywood's best composers.  Yes, if his score had been used instead (not that I've heard it), it would probably have changed the character of the film.  For the best?  That's hard to say.  There's more than one musical personality capable of complementing a Hitchcock film, and if you ask me Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa (Spellbound) and John Williams (Family Plot), writing very differently, do just as well as Herrmann would have with similar material.  John Addison's score for Torn Curtain isn't quite as good, but it's pleasant, and it casts a warm glow over chilly grey surroundings, just as the photography does.  And everyone admits the photography is wonderful - Technicolor greys and beiges, with flashes of red.  Hitchcock had never been quite this good with colour before.  (And no wonder.  I just noticed this in the credits the production designer was the Hein Heckroth - in fact, it was his last film.  His first was The Red Shoes.)Moreover it's one of Hitchcock's better stories.  A man is sent to a foreign country on a mission he finds distasteful; his girlfriend follows him, suspicious about what he's planning to do; they must escape together.  It's one of those stories where we can happily follow one party or the other without feeling cheated out of the other storyline.  It was Hitchcock's first stab at the distasteful mission theme since The Secret Agent (1936), which was a failure - not BECAUSE the hero's mission was distasteful to us, but simply because it wasn't a good film in other regards.  Hitchcock was wrong to think that when a character does dirty things we'll cease to like him.  There's such a thing as moral sympathy the compromising moral position into which Michael is pushed makes us care about him all the more.I'll never understand critical consensus about Hitchcock.  When he takes one of his successful British films (The 39 Steps), one that can hardly be improved upon, and makes a pale imitation of it (North by Northwest), critics and audiences cheer.  When he takes one of his weaker and more muddled British films and turns it into gold, nobody, not even Hitchcock himself, has a kind word to say.  I don't get it.  Torn Curtain has two fantastic scenes as good as anything Hitchcock ever did (the fight with Gromek, the consultation with the East German scientist) and one of his best bit-part characters (the older middle-aged woman who wants to migrate to America).  And there's nothing - NOTHING - wrong with the rest of it. "},{"Title":"Torn Curtain is no rip off","Date":"2 November 2005","Score":"27 out of 42 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Thriller","Review":" Too bad Hitchcock had to create this film in 1966. The spy vs. spy craze was at its height with super-spy James Bond played by ebullient Sean Connery at the top of the movie ladder. Dozens of Cold War espionage thrillers were marketed that year. Even non-spy films touched on espionage from time to time. Adding to the spy mill in 1966 were several espionage television series including the classic spy spoof show Get Smart, created by the comedic giants Mel Brooks and Buck Henry. So to most movie goers of the day Torn Curtain was just another film capitalizing on the spy vs. spy trend. Torn Curtain, however, is one of Hitchcock's best with two scenes that are among his most intense, the almost endless killing of communist agent Hermann Gromek, played with skill by Wolfgang Kieling, and the bus getaway that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The crying fire in a crowded theater is exciting but predictable--the viewer is just waiting for Professor Michael Armstrong (Paul Newman) to jump from his seat and yell. Lovely Julie Andrews has a juicy role as Dr. Sarah Louise Sherman, the soon to be Mrs. Armstrong if the good professor doesn't run away and leave her. When my wife watched this movie for the first time, she asked in a surprising tone of voice, Is that really Paul Newman and Julie Andrews together? This unlikely combination works. It works better than the movies Newman made with his wife, Joanne Woodward. The role of Dr. Sherman is also somewhat unique in that she is unwittingly involved in espionage without her knowledge, following her fianc√©e to Communist East Germany without knowing that he is on an extremely dangerous assignment which only a nuclear scientist can carry out. Hitchcock's film making was beginning to taper off in the twilight of his years. But the masterful hand was still orchestrating film techniques highly original and creative. Lesser directors would have used just anyone to play the small but significant part of the prima donna Countess Kuchinska. Instead Hitchcock searched and found just the right person with the right face and attitude for the role. Lila Kedrova was chosen because she could actually sing opera and because her face and mannerisms stand out in a crowd. In her first appearance when she is getting off the plane, she becomes agitated because Professor Armstrong is receiving all the attention from the press. Hitchcock zooms the camera in for a closeup of her face with its distinctive features. It's well over an hour later that Countess Kuchinska reappears. This reappearance is crucial for the development of the film. Because of Hitchcock's methods, the viewer automatically recognizes the Countess, instantly remembering that she had been upset with Professor Armstrong because of all the attention taken away from her and showered on the professor. She definitely has an ax to grind.Though it has not received much attention compared with many other Hitchcock films, Torn Curtain is among his best and should be savored by all. Even though political conditions have flip flopped since 1966 and there is no longer a communist East Germany, this Cold War delicacy is worth a bite. Oh, and watch the somewhat hidden ironic humor at the beginning where there's a room full of top scientists during the Cold War and the heat doesn't work.

Newman refused, wanting a beer instead and he wanted to drink it from the can!  This request mortified Hitch and his wife.  Needless to say those 2 had their differences.  As for Andrews, she was suffering from Keanu Reeves syndrome.  Keanu Reeves syndrome is when an actor or actress is hugely successful in a role and then is never taken seriously in any other role, especially something radically different, e.g. Reeves as Ted in Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure was never taken seriously in movies like Speed, Point Break, etc.  The same for Andrews who was coming off Mary Poppins and The Sound of Music.

The plot, for what it's worth, is ultimately thin and not convincing (hints of Cloak and Dagger with Gary Cooper way back in 1946) but Newman, at least, pulls off his role as Dr. Armstrong, atomic scientist, with intense restraint. Andrews? She doesn't sing, and there are no children to be seen (except briefly, on Hitchcock's lap in his cameo!), and frankly, sadly, she comes off a little out of her element. But then, her character as Armstrong's assistant is also meant to be a bit out to sea. We don't see too much of her. We do see lots of various bit characters, little known and not very interesting men, mostly, with Swedish or German accents. (I say it that way because they are almost just cardboard props for types of people--you know, those cold hearted Stasi types or the cool and cunning Swedes you can't quite figure out, neither of which is especially true or helpful for the plot.)Of course, Hitchcock doesn't intend to make this a Cold War commentary. (The Spy Who Came in from the Cold with Richard Burton the previous year is the film to see for that.) Hitchcock uses the East German scene as a backdrop for the suspense of deception, and of ordinary people trying not to get caught, a perennial theme he manages so well. Besides Newman, there is a fabulous small role by the great Soviet actress Lila Kedrova that brings the last half hour to life. In the middle of the movie there is one scene that's totally brilliant and wordless, with Newman and Carolyn Conwell in a farmhouse, and it's worth the ride alone. Don't miss that for the world.This can't be Hitchcock's or Newman's or Andrews's best movie for a lot of reasons. But it's a very good movie, which is enough for most of us, and an essential for any Hitchcock fan, and a enlightening surprise for anyone who thinks they know Paul Newman and want to see yet more of his impressive range.

Now he must not only fool the East German security but also save the love of his life.Comments A thriller that, despite being directed by the master Hitchcock, that doesn't quite reach any higher level of suspense. Perhaps one reason is that the two leads, Paul Newman and Julie Andrews, while being great actors and stars might not be best suited for thrillers. They're much better at comedies for example and Torn Curtain has some certain small elements where subtle humor has been injected. While it made me smile now and then it also took the edge of any suspense. I think it would have been much better off if it had focused on one genre of the two.I'm not saying it is a bad movie, because it is not. It is not just as good or full of suspense as you might expect from a Hitchcock thriller. Actually the story is a little thin. I had expected some twists and turns, that some characters would not be what they seemed at first or stated to be, but nothing of that. The story was too straight forward, simply one event following the other without any surprises and without any threat to come really close.So really this is not one of Hitchcock's best. I think it has been branded as a classic just because of his name is attached to it. There are many better thrillers to watch out there.5/10 "}{"Title":"A good plot and an interesting movie.","Date":"21 June 2001","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Thriller","Review":"  The movie might not be one of the best Hitchcock thrillers, but it is still a movie, with a very good plot.

In the two movies that followed his most productive period (1953 - 1964) of great suspense classics such as Vertigo, Psycho and the Birds, there was an attempt of telling stories of political actuality that were set more in the environment of James Bond than following Hitchcock-patterns.The first of them was Torn Curtain and in my opinion the best (though it was also a critically torn curtain!) of the last four movies directed by the master of suspense but far below the mentioned masterpiecesThe main problem though is that the global  don't exactly match with Hitch's concept of people's destruction from within. The menace lies far beyond the characters themselves, it's constructed by countries and governments and not specifically to certain persons, so the actual story of Miss Sherman's and professor Armstrong's emotional journey somehow loses weight in the context of the broad political scenario.One great step in the right direction is taken by not using suggestive music (working so effectively in movies like Psycho or Vertigo), part of which was apparently the result of the lack of Bernard Herrmann's inventive collaboration. Okay, the score by John Addison is easy-listening and background music, but what really counts is the use of on-screen source sounds like the Romeo and Juliet-ballet (which is a nice reminder of The Man Who Knew Too Much) or the sheer absence of music and sound at all which makes it more realistic.Hitch had always been best at showing things instead of talking about them. I would even say that a lot of his concept of suspense is based on mute actions and extremely long takes and scenes during which sometimes nothing seems to happen but scares the devil out of you. And that's where all this German talk fits in. We understand everything even without knowing German. There is a very realistic approach in handling the story that itself sometimes gives you the impression of being quite constructed.The whole affair looks pretty modern in its camera angles and close-ups. There are several extremely well done sequences including the one in which Paul Newman tries to get the secret out of the physicist's head.The true highlight is arguably the murder scene. I dare say it was the first major movie to show the strength and endurance it takes to commit a murder and how unpleasant this all unfolds. It is the exact counterpart of the immortal shower scene in Psycho.To come to an end it's a movie that tries to bridge the gap between the epic scope of the political situation and the interaction of its protagonists. But although it fails in many ways it still tells a thrilling story in the usual masterly craftsmanship. But whether craftsman or artist, politics was never Hitchcock's field...

The man NEVER had a BAD movie.  Torn Curtain possesses all aspects of classic Hitchcock -- interesting locations, clever storyline, suspense, humor, stellar acting, stars, music, among other features.  Perhaps this movie was criticized on pre-production.  Julie Andrews was under contract and her shooting time was very limited.  This posed a problem for Hitchcock who had to rush into production.  Hitchcock also had a problem with his newly trained actor Paul Newman, who would always have it his way or the highway.  Torn Curtain is highly supsenseful and on DVD is a gem.  Presented in widescreen it also features the trailer, a documentary, and scenes with Bernard Herrmann's unused score.  Thank god Herrmann didn't get the job to score this movie -- as much as Herrmann proved to be perfect for classics like Vertigo and Marnie (known as his best) -- he was way out of his league here.  Torn Curtain was very ahead of it's time dealing with suspense, romance, and the Cold War.  John Addison performed an excellent score fitting the movie well with the recurring theme that can either make you jump or cry.

The scene with the fight of Armstrong and the farmer's wife with Gromek is very tense and one of the best moments.

What's going on? Hitchcock hated locations, but this had a big budget..he wants, I think, to make a film that is somewhat false, scenic, derivative even..in plot structural terms,an overestimation of Communism and its threat to our materialistic world. Look at Julie Andrew's hair and clothes..very expensive, very much like Marnie. It has an anti McCarthyism mood about it, a comic book flavor to it that justifies many otherwise awkward technical moments.

Cold War spy thrillers were common during that era, including of course the more light hearted, entertaining James Bond series. I suspect this is more of a 'man's film' with its lengthy murder scene and so on, not really quite my cup of tea.

The movie chronicles the story of an American rocket scientist named Michael Armstrong, who is attending a convention in Coppenhagen with his assistant and fianc√©e, Sarah Sherman. She becomes suspicious of his behaviour and follows him to East Germany, where he appears to be considering defection.The film is memorable to me these many years later for its two stars. Paul Newman portrays the scientist, Michael Armstrong, I'm sure competently, but I kept wanting to see some of his legendary easy going charm, quite lacking in this character! Julie Andrews, fresh from Mary Poppins and The Sound of Music, plays Sarah in a very dramatically different role. The chemistry between the two leads is adequate here but there's not much to the love story, and I confess to vastly preferring Andrews' 1974 Cold War suspense film, The Tamarind Seed, costarring Omar Sharif, as it has more in the romance department.

A problem, if there is one, is the unimaginative script of Brian Moore, which includes flicking a cigarette lighter in a room used to successfully kill man with cooking gas and a spy who comes late to a dance party, makes contact with the hero and leaves after a single dance, without raising suspicion of all the others.Torn Curtain is not a film in which Hitchcock is less effective than in any other work of his. The killing of Gromek is probably the finest and realistic Hitchcock. The escape of Paul Newman from the theater by yelling Fire is as good as the efforts of Cary Grant creating a diversion during an auction in North by Northwest. The bus escape sequence seems to be remarkably close to Anatole Litvak's The Journey made seven years before this film with Yul Brynner and Deborah Kerr, but Hitchcock infuses elements of suspense creditably. The escape from the ship is classic Hitchcock, where the viewer is deliberately led to believe that a diversion is the real escape. The stare of recognition by the ballerina, captured by zooming in the camera to her face, was effective but crude.Beginning with the imaginative scene of a ship passenger poking his frozen glass of water with a fork to indicate the freezing temperature on the ship, Hitchcock never lets us down. The casting of Newman and Andrews was interesting and the opening scene of the couple in bed is sensuous without being vulgar. Andrews is able to present her range of capabilities beyond family dramas that came to the fore much later in Victor/Victoria. Lila Kedrova, though interesting has a narrow range of emotional expressions, most of which she displayed in her award wining performance in Zorba the Greek.

Yet somehow, as with 'Topaz' later, there is more fizzle than sizzle on display. It's hard to determine the problems, but certainly we know he wasn't thrilled with the studio-enforced casting of Andrews and Newman, and he admits to a few errors in judgement in his conversation with Truffaut, not least the dodgy 'backdrop' reel used during the bus chase. Curiously, whilst Hitchcock was crafting interesting, often strong-willed female characters during this period (Psycho, The Birds, Marnie, North By Northwest), with Andrews' Sarah Sherman he fashions a more passive woman, and consequently gives Andrews little to do but look either adoringly or woundedly at Newman. Newman fares better (although I never truly 'believe' Michael loves Sarah), but as usual Hitchcock fills the film with wonderful supporting characters and actors - Kedrova in particular blows the leads off the screen and her sequence is fantastic. So whilst 'Torn Curtain' is riddled with beautiful Hitchcock touches (the long shot of Michael approaching the farmer across the field; Gromek's very disturbing, prolonged murder - an electrifying performance by Conwell - the prima-ballerina's noticing of Michael in the audience), in the end it is one of his lesser works.

It may be lacking some of the wit, complexity of character and shock value of some of his recognised greats but it certainly makes up for it with thrills aplenty, an exciting and unquestionably intelligent plot, stunning photography and a ceaselessly exhilarating pace.Of the two leads it is certainly Paul Newman who shines. He delivers an understated, subtle performance which positively smolders with intensity and truth. It is also refreshing to see him playing something other than the macho, all action ladies man. His portrayal as an average man, an academic, gentle, quiet struggling to adapt to life as a spy is wholly believable.Julie was a relatively new star and Hitch said that he had been talked into casting her as she was so hot at the time. It must be said that wonderful as Julie Andrew is she turns in a very average performance. Giving us nothing but Julie Andrews. She lacks any real intensity and certainly lacks believability.The only failing perhaps is the script. Although it is impeccably structured, the dialogue is lacking in many ways. Hitch was never happy with the script, as he was worried that it contained none of the humour which had characterised some of his previous successes. Newman also had many complaints about the script. He felt it lacked energy and credibility.Visually it is as stunning as Hitchcock gets. His shot composition and editing creates a visual treat. He uses colour If Torn Curtain is to be remembered for one scene alone it is the stunningly shot murder of Gromek.He builds up the prelude to the murder with quick cuts and then very suddenly initiates it with the sound of a pot crashing against the wall. Other than this the murder scene is practically silent. Composer Bernard Herrman had in fact written a score for this section of the movie. Hitchcock was dissatisfied with the music. And after firing Herrmann Hitchcock dispensed with music altogether in this scene. The lengthy struggle wonderfully shows how difficult it would be to kill a man an act which many other espionage thrillers at the time criminally over simplified. As Hitchcock one said Murder can be fun.The firing of Bernard Herrman in my view was a huge error on Hitchcock's part. Having heard the original score which Herrmann composed I can assert that as with prior collaborations such as Psycho and Vertigo, the score perfectly accents and compliments Hitchcock's visuals. And the John Addison score pales in comparison.In short, I think it is high time this movie was given the credit it deserves and that it takes it place in the pantheon of Hitchcock greats.

Read at your own risk.This 1966 Paul Newman-Julie Andrews film, directed by none other than the Master, Alfred Hitchcock, is, for me, quite a mixed bag.First, I will cover the bad points before I get to the good. The major con to this movie is Julie Andrews. I normally like her a lot-in films like THE SOUND OF MUSIC, 10, and VICTOR-VICTORIA, but this film does not suit her acting style, causing her to become unbelievable, and the scenes involving Lila Kedrova as Countess Kuchinska were grotesque and pointless in this otherwise emotionally-devoid film. Also, John Addison's score does not add anything at all to the film, in fact it takes away. Bernard Herrmann's was far more suitable. Now onto the pros. My favorite scene, of course, is the murder of Gromek in the farmhouse outside Berlin. Other favorites include The pursuit through the Museum zu Berlin, the discovering of Gromek's body and motorcycle, and the party scene in Leipzig. All in all this film's pros outweigh the cons, but it just doesn't live up to Hitchcock's other works. This film is particularly gray, especially depicted in the scene when Armstrong, Sherman, Gromek, and Manfred are driving from the Airport to Berlin, the transition from evening to morning at the Hotel Berlin, the bus pursuit through the German countryside, and all the scenes in Leipzig.I recommend this film to those who want to experience other types of Hitchcock films.

Hitch did get along quite well with most of his actors, and Im sure Julie was no exception... that doesn't mean she was right for the part - nor that she did a very good job, which she didn't.Hitchcock's brilliance is shown in the scenes where his camera takes over, and the acting can be put aside.  Gromek's killing is one of the best examples of Pure Cinema.  And when Gromek is chasing Newman through a meuseum and all that is heard is footsteps, that is brilliant.  Th bus scene would have been even better, probably, with a Herrmann score, and a better rear-projection screen which would make it more realistic.

While Torn Curtain has sporadic tense moments, it certainly doesn't tear you apart. And in Paul Newman and Julie Andrews, the casting people have found two of the least Hitchcockian stars ever to appear in a Hitchcockian feature. Professor Michael Armstrong (Paul Newman) is in Copenhagen for a science conference, accompanied by his assistant and fiancee Sarah Sherman (Julie Andrews). Armstrong suddenly makes a decision to defect to the communist side, leaving his bride-to-be bewildered and upset. She decides to follow him to East Germany, where she learns that his defection is actually an elaborate ruse, his true aim being to get hold of a top secret communist missile formula. Too late, Sarah realises that by tailing her lover to East Germany she has jeopardised his mission, and the pair of them have to try to escape back to the west aided by the East German underground. The plot is good enough to make for a better film than the one Hitchcock has provided. Part of that is probably due to the fact that these Cold War mystifiers are not really the type of thing Hitchcock would normally go for (John Frankenheimer or Lewis Gilbert might have been better candidates to direct). Also, Brian Moore's script is riddled with cliches and unconvincing dialogue. That's not to say the film is all bad. There is a horrifying and graphic murder sequence in which Newman discovers that killing an enemy can be pretty difficult, and the fake fire sequence at the ballet show near the film's climax is nicely handled. On the whole, Torn Curtain is too routine to be worthy of its fine director and actors. It comes across as a totally competent but undistinguished spy thriller, hard to tell apart from a hundred other movies of its kind.

His assistant/play-thing in the off-hours/fiancee, played by the teary-eyed yet very controlled Julie Andrews, insisted on following him everywhere.  Supporting characters and events were thrown in and shoved out at random.  That's right... there was the German woman on the farm who helped him murder the spy in the apparently-famous scene and then completely dissapeared without ever haven spoken in English, the doctor who dashed in and out with her efforts to help Newman and Andrews escape from Germany (?), and, of course, the Polish countess who adds nothing at all except perhaps a symbolism of the desparation so many felt to immigrate to America.  The movie did nothing to me at all; never any tense, emotional, frightening moments, never any suspense, never any comedy, never any melodrama, and zero chemistry between Newman and Andrews.

The only problem is his fianc√©e Sarah has unwittingly followed him and doesn't know the whole story &#x85;This is a pretty solid spy thriller of the type Hitch liked to make, with the hero chasing a MacGuffin (in this case a complex formula for nuclear missile propulsion), shifty bad guys, oddball supporting characters and plenty of chases. The main difference here is that the man is a bit of a schemer and the woman is an everyday innocent, a gender switch from the usual pattern. This is perhaps its chief liability - Andrews is okay and handles the victimised first third quite well but is too wholesome for a Hitchcock movie and doesn't really have much chemistry with Newman. Once the action switches to him it picks up well though, with the eerie pursuit through the art gallery and the skin-crawling murder of the Stasi agent Gromek in the farmhouse. Equally brilliant is the device of having Armstrong appeal to Professor Lindt's intellect just enough to make him reveal the secret formula in shades of exasperation and arrogance. Despite the big sweep, Hitch reigns each scene in tightly as the net closes in on our heroes, maintaining the tension and injecting his usual flashes of humour, like the old lady with the heavy case getting on the bus or the endless wait for the connection at the post office. Whilst this may not rank in the top drawer of his spy films (my favourite is The 39 Steps), it's still an exciting and extremely well made picture, with a good story and some great sequences.

After a first viewing, I can't say I understand why it has received such a poor reputation. Certainly, the film seems somewhat mediocre when compared to such timeless classics as 'Psycho (1960)' and 'Vertigo (1958),' but, then again, so does just about every other film that any director has produced in the last 100 years. 'Torn Curtain' is another of Hitchcock's capable attempts at a spy picture, a sort of traditionally-styled rendering of a James Bond film Terence Young's 'Dr. No' had been released in 1962 to enormous success, initiating a multi-billion dollar saga that was already reaping huge rewards by 1966. Even though the chemistry between the two stars, Paul Newman and Julie Andrews, doesn't always work, Hitchcock focuses much of the film on the diverse range of foreign characters, a selection of unusual and contrasting eccentrics who make the film a definite joy to watch.Michael Armstrong (Newman) is a respected American scientist who has seemingly defected over to East Germany to aid their nuclear weapons research the Cold War being very much alive-and-well at the time. Sarah Louise Sherman (Andrews) is suspicious of her fianc√©'s actions, and trails him to East Berlin, her love for Michael forcing her to embrace the Communists' plans in order to remain with him. The first act of the film mostly takes place from Sarah's point of view, and, as we watch Michael suspiciously formulating his treasonous campaign, we begin to suspect that he is the movie's primary villain. However, this is where the Master of Suspense pulls his first twist, and Michael's behaviour is revealed to be merely a ruse, with the objective of acquiring vital nuclear weapons data from an oddball Commie scientist, Professor Gustav Lindt (Ludwig Donath). From here, Newman becomes a traditional cinematic hero, and, after uncovering the information that he required, he and Sarah, with the help of numerous fellow conspirators, must reach friendly territory without being captured.Famously, the production of 'Torn Curtain' didn't run as smoothly as could have been hoped. The director was hesitant about using Newman and Andrews, and both were thrust upon him by the studios, despite Hitchcock's differing preferences. Newman, for one, proved very problematic for the master director, repeatedly questioning the script and his character in a manner Hitchcock later described as disrespectful. Newman has stated that I think Hitch and I could have really hit it off, but the script kept getting in the way. Also notably, 'Torn Curtain' marked a devastating falling-out between Alfred Hitchcock and the legendary Bernard Herrmann, who composed a complete score for the film that was never used instead, the director opted for British composer John Addison.Say what you want about the film as a whole, but nobody can deny that it contains several completely unforgettable set-pieces. The murder of the charismatic henchman, Hermann Gromek (Wolfgang Kieling), is truly a horrifyingly gruelling sequence, which Hitchcock created specifically to show the audience how difficult it actually is to kill a man. The entire sequence plays out in almost complete silence, with the struggling Gromek even surviving a bloody knife wound that would have instantly killed a character in any other film. Another moment of Hitchcock genius takes place as Michael and Sarah attempt to flee East Germany, as, during a bus journey, they hope that the Communist troops don't realise that they are not riding in a legitimate vehicle. Add to this the suspenseful escape at a crowded theatre, the amusing moments featuring a disgruntled ballerina (Tamara Toumanova) and John F. Warren's polished cinematography, and you've got a spy thriller that is very much worth watching.

By the time he made Torn Curtain both his career and the movie business were in very different places. Andrews and Newmann were well-qualified and in this writer's opinion, fit the roles for which they were cast, as did the rest of the ensemble. Hermann's ejection from the project is widely regarded as the big mistake it was. There are still moments of brilliance, including the ballerina moment, the farmhouse scene, the bit in the coffee house, the facial expression of the East German cop as he fires his machine gun and much more but perhaps Hithcock's direction of his leading actors was lacking in confidence and rapport. Meanwhile the sets are mostly quite accurate and convincing (if they seem sparse and cheap to some 2000s era viewers it's only because that's how post-war East Berlin truly looked in the mid-1960s) and even the back projections, an AH trademark, have a successful cinematic function. What's missing, thereby setting all akilter, is the human chemistry of artfully directed and inspired leading actors, never mind the lack of a competent musical score (what he settled on is truly inept, thin and without artistic sensitivity to either the script or the film). Both of these weaknesses might be laid, sadly, on Hitchcock's own mishandling of the circumstances. Ironically, the best performances are seen in the bit parts including one seldom mentioned, the young East German woman in the farmhouse.

Hitchcock himself gave an interview shortly before the film was released stating that it was awfully hard these days to find a really good scriptwriter. He must have had his latest upcoming film in mind.Newman is a scientist on a spy mission in East Germany and has to pretend to be a defector in order to find out any information. Julie is along for company and soon gets just as involved in the situation as he is. When they're about to be discovered, they have to flee and therein lies the rest of the plot. If the proceedings had been done with any sort of wit or originality, this might have been a fun film to watch. Neither star shows a bit of chemistry in their relationship.As it is, there's only one chilling scene set in a farmhouse where Newman and a farm woman have to kill a German scientist who knows too much about them and their mission. How they struggle to kill the man, who fights for his life with a great deal of resilience (he's harder to kill than Rasputin), makes for the most Hitchcock-like suspense in the whole film.Not worthwhile unless you're an avid fan who must see anything Newman or Andrews does.

I think it is a decent film, but I admit I was disappointed. Torn Curtain is a good cold-war espionage thriller, however it doesn't rank in my favourite Hitchcock movies list(like North By Northwest, Psycho, Rebecca, Vertigo and Rear Window). I did prefer The Birds, Stage Fright and Spellbound over this.My main problem with Torn Curtain was the pace. It was a good length, but the pace was disappointingly sluggish. Another problem was the script. I will agree that there are flashes of interest and suspense, but on the whole the script came across as rather underdeveloped and turgid. There are some nice sets, but there are also some phony-looking ones, especially the hill on which the characters go up to to chat.Many have complained about John Addison's score. I can understand this, I found it nice but forgettable sadly. Bernard Hermann (whose score for Vertigo especially was full of suspense and induces goosebumps though my favourite score for any Hitchcock movie is Miklos Rosza's for Spellbound) would have been a much better choice as composer, the score in the film just wasn't suspenseful enough. I don't really blame Hitchcock for any of these problems. If anything I blame the studio. They should have let Hitchcock do what he wanted rather than forcing him to get the score changed and change his casting choices.I always found Hitchcock to be a great director. While reported to be uninterested and dissatisfied with the film, the direction wasn't too bad at all. There are some elements of Hitchcockian suspense. The plot was intriguing enough, a little confusing in places, but a very nice idea that starts off very promisingly. One of the recurring themes of Hitchcock's movies is the plight of the common man caught up in uncommon circumstances. It is this theme here, with the plot telling of a woman believing that her fianc√© intends to defect to East Berlin in order to get funding for his pet project.The acting was a mixed bag. I had no problem with Paul Newman, seeing as he gave a very brooding and intense performance. I have loved Julie Andrews in films like Mary Poppins and Sound of Music, but I for one found her an odd casting choice. She wasn't bad, she was merely okay, but what did disappoint was the lack of chemistry between the two leads and the fact that Sarah Sherman isn't exactly the fully fleshed out character Hitchcock would have liked. Wolfgang Kieling is great as Gromek, the sinister villain of the piece though.It may look as though I hated Torn Curtain. I didn't, far from it. The cinematography was very nice, with dark colours and pretty looking scenes. It is one of the most beautiful looking late-Hitchcocks. The costumes are pretty to look at too. And while there are pacing problems throughout, there are some truly effective scenes. One that springs to mind is the film's highlight, the murder scene. It was shockingly graphic, and one of the most realistic and graphic murder scenes in any thriller. I was impressed with the ballet scene too. The choreography was impressive, and the music featured was Tchaikovsky's Francessca Da Rimini. Brilliant music, shame really you don't hear it in its entirety it is really something. There are some entertaining bits as well, notably Armstrong's conversation with Lindt.All in all, deeply flawed Hitchcock film, but it is at least watchable and it could have been much worse than it was. I was disappointed I admit that, but I would watch Torn Curtain again if given the choice. I think perhaps it is underrated, because while far from the master's best it is a decent film. 7/10 Bethany Cox "}{"Title":"The Cold War was so sad that it makes us laugh today","Date":"2 February 2009","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Thriller","Review":" Hitchcock was not brilliantly inspired with this film, even and maybe especially in 1966. It is true it was a very deep period in the Cold War, but because the trap of a war the US were already largely engaged in and involved in, the Vietnam War, was literally starting to shake the whole world with horror and to menace that world on its very basis after the sigh of relief we all let out after the Cuban missile crisis. So Hitchcock had to do a cold war film, so what, and he chose the easiest target he could find, East Germany, though that was rather easy, but even if it was easy it did not take him away from the good old European or Western tradition he would have lost if he had gone further East, and then he would have been lost in translation. And at the same time we feel there is at least one tongue in one cheek, and I would say on both sides of the mouth. What makes it a whole farce in a way? It is the whole vanity of the spying-counter-spying mission of that poor Professor Armstrong. To get out of an East German scientist the key scientific element of a discovery that could save the world from any nuclear war. First it was absurd to imagine the East doing some research to guarantee peace since western propaganda was repeating day after and night after night and week after week that their standard identity was that of a war-mongering empire. But the best of it all is that they send a scientist to get that element out of this East German, and that that amateur spy is getting the secret by tricking the East German into revealing him that secret out of vanity. And of course the East German professor understands he has been tricked by an ignoramus, but slightly too late. And every detail is going that way. Every situation is absurdly upside down. And these impossible elements become some kind of black, very black, blacker than black humor. Blacker than I you die, as the saying could have it. You'll have to watch the film to get a good laugh. In the entirely collectivized agriculture of East Germany you have one farm worker on his tractor doing nothing in the middle of a field, alone, and running around on his tractor waiting for the arrival of our Armstrong to tell him who knows what about who knows what. That is probably the most incredible element in that film, that absolutely solitary person in a regime that was based on the total absence of solitude. And what about the girl in the totally isolated farm alone again and her carelessness of not erasing the symbolic PI from the dirt in the farmyard. And once again what was that solitary farm doing in a collectivized agriculture? And the escape is more than a laugh. It is sad today to be so naively funny. Escape upon escape with so thin threads to hold it all up that we wonder if it is not some kind of joke. But the best is the female ballet dancer who recognizes Armstrong and his girlfriend in the middle of the opera from the stage with all limelight and overhead lights and all other lights on and blaring their dazzling light. Anyone who has any knowledge about that kind of situation will say it is impossible. Stage lights are like an unbreakable cocoon of light for the artists on the stage. Really that kind of humor is like everyone wants to go to heaven, but no one wants to go now. The final stages of the escape I can't tell because they are too sad in their fun, especially the episode of highwaymen on East German roads. If there was something typical of East Germany, it was their extraordinary honesty. Stealing was not even a crime that had to be banned or forbidden because stealing was just foreign to their minds. That was probably the best achievement of these communist societies they ignored crime, not because it was not advertised, but just because it did not exist, or was so marginal that it was anachronistic to mention it. At the same time Hitchcock captured some of the traits of that East German society so well that it is better than Goodbye Lenin, even if the mention of good coffee is so nostalgically true. I am afraid a modern audience might find it boring because it is, since every single detail has to be remembered out of oblivion.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines "},{"Title":"By No Means Hitchcock's Best, but Nonetheless, a Great Film","Date":"22 January 2008","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Thriller","Review":" Torn Curtain is an edge of your seat thrill ride that scarcely gives you a moment to breathe.

It's not Alfred Hitchcock; it's not even somebody trying to be Alfred Hitchcock.  For a director known for his tight plots, attention to detail, brilliant and innovative camera angles, unending suspense and getting the most from his actors, TORN CURTAIN fails on all fronts.  The pace is so sluggish and uneven that it makes Stanley Kubrick look exciting.  The plot is simply ludicrous, with far too many untenable points and downright errors and gaps to list here Flick a lighter in a house full of natural gas?  I doubt it.  Leave the party after only one dance and not attract suspicion?  Unlikely!.  Hitch and/or his screenwriter(s) simply did not know how to -- or didn't make the effort to try to -- construct a plausible scenario of international intrigue. The cinematography is average at best, bad at worst.  The short shot of Prof. Armstrong (Newman) falling down the stairs is almost cartoonish. The fight scene is thoroughly contrived and so bad it is almost unwatchable. As for suspense, there is some, but it, like the plot, is uneven to the point where it loses its impact.  Most of the suspensful points -- such as Armstrong's and, later, Sherman's (Andrews') motives -- are resolved quickly, and early in the film.  TORN CURTAIN lacks the ongoing intensity and emotional absorption of nearly all of Hitch's other films.Finally, the acting, which is downright dreadful.  In addition to Hitch's name above the title, I looked forward to seeing Paul Newman and Julie Andrews perform together during their early years.  They try, but even these two great actors cannot redeem this picture.  Their performances are uninspiring to the point where they show little interest or emotional attachment to the events around them.  Paul Newman doesn't seem convinced that he himself is a brilliant scientist, so how could he convince the East Germans?  Julie Andrews fares a little better, but is still annoying in this role that, some say, she didn't really want.  The supporting cast, unfortunately, is far worse, made up of wooden characters who are entirely stereotyped and performed by either very bad actors or, at best, actors who Hitch made no effort to inspire.  The only brief glimpses of humanity are in Dr. Koska's daughter and the farmer / PI agent neither of whom, unfortunately, appear on screen long enough to redeem this amateurish production.Was Hitch lazy, inept, or distracted in his later years?  Did he need more help?  He was 66 at the time.  Was it a bad time for him to start new collaborations?  TORN CURTAIN raises some questions.  In fairness, I have not seen his final three films, but having just seen the film which preceeded them, I am not exactly in a mad rush to check them off my list.

As here. Abysmal drivel from beginning to end, it's hard to know whether to laugh or cry -- the latter, perhaps, yet then again, cinema-goers are here confronted with at least some of the truth about Mr Hitchcock.Though 'Frenzy' was to expose Hitchcock's odious pathology in all its nauseating glory several years later -- in an extended murder scene that says nothing about the plot but everything about the director -- here in 'Torn Curtain' exists its progenitor as risibly inept an extended murder scene as has ever been committed to celluloid.That it doesn't work at any level is self-apparent. That Hitchcock failed utterly to realise that, ditto. But as an insight into the Hitchcock psyche, it's well-nigh priceless the slavering camera work, the stupendously unrealistic acting, the inability of both direction and editing to appreciate the difference between butchery and burlesque; all testify to a directorial presence and a directorial personality to which application of the description 'seedy' would be a polite under-statement.Currently, in the UK at least, there's an issue about 'seniors' working on. Hitchcock's oeuvre proves, conversely, that age is not to be desired, for as a film-maker he was already in a decline made all the more embarrassing for the way his output reflected his inner demons.To be fair, there's also a sadness about 'Torn Curtain' too, in particular the desperately pathetic harking back to the chillingly ominous vistas of 'North By North West', reprised here -- though without any success at all -- in Newman's visit to a quite ludicrous tractor-driving US spy on a farm outside East Berlin.Elsewhere though, it's mere floundering, an irredeemable mess of a movie where the pace drags as if through treacle and nothing, not even the music -- Addison's contribution very probably tolled the knell for this kind of English score writing, a brick being more subtle by comparison -- can rescue it from its vanities and, in the director's case, morbid voyeurism.'Frenzy' was cheap, nasty, and a sign of a great talent finally expunged.

It exists, and cheekily for a while it holds the interest.Atmosphere is set at bleak, which is in keeping with the atmosphere behind the scenes of the production - casting decisions, fall outs et al - so really it's not a must see movie.

I was really looking forward to watching this thriller that takes us behind the Iron Curtain and which has Paul Newman playing an American scientist who appears to have defected but is actually a double agent and fully engaged in espionage.Early on in the film we observe that while American Professor Michael Armstrong (played by Paul Newman) is boringly involved in bedding down Sarah Sherman (played by Julie Andrews) Professor Armstrong is also engaged in an exchange of hidden notes and messages through telegrams that he opens and reads in different parts of the ship that he is travelling on. You would think that with the addition of a musical score that Hitchcock could build up the suspense but in actuality I was easily distracted and lost interest in the storyline as well as in the lack of chemistry between the two lead actors Newman and Christie.It just goes to show you that even with a great director, and two super star actors unless you can maintain a flow to the film and without a good musical score to match the storyline the audience just cannot buy in. I won't ask for my money back but I would say that Torn Curtain did allow me to organize my paperwork and make a few phone calls as it played in the background because I was not missing anything that was (not) playing on the screen.Sadly I have to rate Torn Curtain a low 4 out of 10.

Using this logic, one would conclude that Torn Curtain was the beginning of the end of Hitch's career. But that doesn't do the movie justice. The Sultan of Suspense didn't create any mind-blowing scenes for this movie like he did in Psycho or The Birds, but there's a scene towards the end that has no shortage of suspense.Paul Newman plays an American scientist whose fianc√©e (Julie Andrews) discovers that he's headed for East Germany...but there's more than meets the eye. Newman is in top form naturally, but I'd say that the movie belongs to Andrews. She gets to play a role very unlike those with which she's associated. Far from the happy-go-lucky performances as Mary Poppins and Maria von Trapp, her character here is a tense, scientific-minded person who understands geopolitics (although unlike a lot of Hitchcock's female characters, hers is not a guilty woman).In the end I would say that even though Hitch had passed his prime, he hadn't lost his touch. I recommend the movie. He went on to complete three more movies after this one, and was planning another one when he died.So, the next time that you hear Julie Andrews sing about a teaspoon of sugar or a name to call myself, just remember that she also starred in a Cold War thriller.Watch for a young Wilhelm von Homburg (Vigo in Ghostbusters 2) towards the end.

TORN CURTAIN, while certainly topical in its examination of Cold War politics, nuclear secrets and double agents, largely fails to do what every other Hitchcock picture I've seen so far has done, i.e., be entertaining. Granted, there are a few sequences that recall classic Hitch, but they are barely enough to distract from how dull this was to get through at times. In what would be his last usage of marquee talent, Paul Newman and Julie Andrews star as a couple of scientists who publicly defect to East Germany at the height of the Cold War in order to gain access to an important formula or nuclear secret. Honestly, as the film's MacGuffin, this piece of information doesn't really matter (to the audience, at least). And that's fine. However, matters aren't helped by having such weak characters despite being capably played such talented actors and Newman and Andrews. Even the chemistry between them was barely better than Connery and Hedren in MARNIE. There was also no memorable villain. Still, at the risk of beating down too much on the film, there were a few sequences that I will probably remember for while. The best of these happens close to halfway in, and involves a tense brawl between Newman and an East German agent who has gotten onto his secret plans. It plays out sans score, and was incredibly tense. Towards the end, there was also a bus-riding sequence and a scene in a theater that recalled the climax to THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH. It wasn't as good as the former, but still stood out. If there's one thing that's sorely missed, it's Bernard Herrmann as composer, here replaced by John Addison. I did like a number of the cues, but I can only imagine that Herrmann's score would have been much better. Even so, I liked the jazz-inflected touch that Addison brought to the material. Ultimately, though, TORN CURTAIN suffers by having terrible pacing and taking too long to really kick into gear. The last 40-45 minutes, minus a pointless semi-comic detour, is able to salvage some of what came before, but the film is still overall kind of boring.

After the financial failure of Marnie (1964), Alfred Hitchcock chose to play it safer and moved away from the complex psychological aspects of that film and into the more populist, less ambiguous spy thriller territory with his next two films Torn Curtain and Topaz (1969). Unfortunately, the decision did not pay off, as both of those were equally as unsuccessful at the box office as the darker, less straightforward Marnie. For me, Marnie is easily the best of Hitchcock's three 60's box office bombs but of the two spy thrillers, Torn Curtain is superior to Topaz. It's less flabby and more concise, yet both films share a similar characteristic where they begin very well but lose their way somewhat in their final third. With Torn Curtain, the initial set-up is somewhat intriguing and paced very well; it also includes a classic Hitchcock scene where a man and a woman kill a communist security agent in a farmhouse in a particularly protracted an messy fashion, going against cinematic norms and illustrating the sheer difficulty of killing someone. But psychological edginess is eventually disregarded and the plot essentially mutates into a chase movie which is a bit of a let-down considering the potential that has been put in place in the set-up.Its story has an American nuclear physicist defect to East Germany but finds his situation complicated when his fianc√© follows him. This one is also typified by featuring two actual mega-stars of its day in Paul Newman and Julie Andrews. It has to be said though that neither of them seem to be at their best here and their performances almost feel a bit forced. Seemingly Hitchcock did not work well with method actor Newman and this clash of styles could be at least partially responsible for the uneasy feeling on-screen. Torn Curtain is hardly a disaster though as it does contain some great moments and benefits from a very polished look. And in fairness, even though it is somewhat routine, it's no less so that a few of Hitchcock's earlier more lauded thrillers. I do feel though that this director is at his best when he is working with material with more psychological edginess, as opposed to the more straightforward suspense embodied in Torn Curtain. It's a solid but unspectacular affair.

A low budget thriller, which shocked the world and cinema forever. His successful career continued when he brought us a modern horror movie, The Birds (1963), which still is seen by many as the most intelligent horror film of all time. One year after Hitchcock continued his problematic cooperation with Tippi Hedren when he made Marnie (1964). Marnie was a critical and a box office flop, but today is seen as a classic. After Marnie Hitchcock started to film a new Cold War spy-film, Torn Curtain. He had made a movie with a similar subject earlier in 1959, North By Northwest. Hitchcock has said that he didn't like the cast he had to work with. He just had to take Julie Andrews and Paul Newman because they were hot and popular at the time. Alfred Hitchcock has other problems too with his crew, he wasn't satisfied with his composer, Bernard Herrman (Psycho) and replaced him by John Addison.As many good movies so is Torn Curtain, divided into three acts. Alfred Hitchcock added the change of perspective in each of the acts. In the first act we're in the shadows, we see everything from Sarah's point of view and are unaware of Michale's secret. When the agent, who is keeping an eye on Michael starts to have suspicions we move to act two, which is told us from Michael's point of view. This act includes the famous murder of Gromek (The agent). When Michael decides to tell the truth to Sarah we move to the third act, which is told to us from the perspective of Michael and Sarah.Even that Torn Curtain is very well forgotten, it has several well remembered scenes. For instance the murder of Gromek and the Balet scene. The interesting thing in the murder scene, is the fact how it resembles the shower scene of Psycho. In 1960 when Hitchcock was directing Psycho, Bernard Herrmann suggested a score for the shower scene, but Hitchcock denied. He said that it had to be a silent scene, absolutely. The audience should only hear screams and the stabs of the knife. But when Herrman kept on trying to get his music to the scene, Hitchcock agreed to try it. After the first listen he said This scene must have a score. Well in Torn Curtain, Alfred Hitchcock once again wanted to make the murder scene quiet, but Bernard Herrman composed a score for it. After their disagreements Hitchcock fired him and replaced with another composer. Surprisingly, John Addison also composed a score for the murder scene, but Hitchcock didn't use it and made the scene silent. Which in my opinion was a perfect choice. The silence leads us to the despair of the characters and to the fear of the fear that is in ourselves. The most horrifying fear is when we start to resemble our enemies.The famous scene, near the end, happens in the Balet hall. As in Hitchcock's earlier film, The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956) the drama of the play is reflected to the drama happening in the actual story. In The Man Who Knew Too Much a bullet is shot at the same time the cymbals crash. But in Torn Curtain Paul Newman's character sees the fake fire on stage, and gets the idea of shouting Fire! in order to escape the hall.Alfred Hitchcock always combined romance, excitement and humor. Sometimes he managed to put all of these elements in one scene. For instance in the scene with the bus. He was also known from his funny and sympathetic side characters. In Torn Curtain the best are agent Gromek, Professor Gustav Lindt and the Polish lady. Gromek is a very sympathetic character, which is very good, because many tend to shows communists and other bad guys as monsters. But Hitchcock showed that he was a human just like you and I. The same that Chaplin did with The Great Dictator, the Nazis weren't monsters, the ideology they were following was. There is a funny detail about Lindt, you see his name came from Hitchcock's favorite chocolate, Lindt. He is also a very sympathetic character. Then last but not least, the Polish lady, who is portrayed from too angles. First she seems sad, sympathetic, weak and a helpful lady, but then Hitchcock showed her darker side, a demanding person who can blackmail.Torn Curtain is a very well made spy film in many ways. It's very carefully designed, the cinematography is brilliant and the world of colors in costumes and set ups, designed by Hitchcock worked perfectly. His masterful visual narrative gets in its rights in many scenes. In the opening he manages to tell us many things, only using his camera, it's cold, there are scientists, two of them are missing and the main characters are in love. The film entails some thrilling, intelligent scenes, just as the films by Hitchcock always do. The critics called the film old-fashioned, but I thought it was very good. The subject was current, and adds historical interest to the film. It might not be his best film or No North By Northwest as the critics said, but it is a very well designed thrilling Cold War spy film. And by far superior than Hitchcock's other Cold War spy film, Topaz (1969), which is not a bad film either. Torn Curtain is an exciting film, with no dull moment, and it entails some intellectual themes, typical for the films from The Cold War.

The surprise of course is the play on words in the title that does service to the era's preoccupation with the Iron Curtain, a concept that's already fading to the consciousness of those too young to remember the historic events of late 1989 when the Berlin Wall actually came down. The other surprise had to do with the picture's lead actors, I didn't know that Paul Newman and Julie Andrews had ever worked for Alfred Hitchcock.The early going was somewhat disorienting for me, I just didn't want to believe that Newman was cast as a traitor to his country. That set up was cleverly handled, particularly with Professor Armstrong's (Newman) double agent status kept a secret from his fianc√©e Sarah Sherman (Andrews). As the story unfolds however, it becomes increasingly difficult to believe that Armstrong's mission had any chance of success. Especially after Gromek's disappearance and the recovery of the motorbike at the farm. Speaking of which, I got a kick out of that scene where Armstrong and the farm wife dispatched the German bodyguard. While being strangled, Gromek rather calmly advised Armstrong that he ought to stop because he (Gromek) was a trained professional. Like that was going to have an impact on Armstrong's decision to try and stay alive, hmm.Hey, how about the line Gromek used earlier to Armstrong while in the museum - Strictly for the birds, huh? I wonder if Hitchcock was paying tribute to his 1963 suspense film.Overall, I rather liked this film despite it's disapproval with the critics. Curiously, it seems that I wind up on the opposite side of most viewers for Hitchcock's pictures, as I don't particularly think Strangers On A Train and Shadow Of A Doubt deserve the reputation they have for reasons expressed in my reviews of those films in this forum. I guess that's one of the benefits of going into a picture cold as it were, there aren't any prejudices as to whether one should like the picture or not.

Ms. Andrews doesn't know it, but Mr. Newman is preparing to defect to the Soviet Bloc. Further explanation would spoil the plot, which takes both expected and unexpected turns.Alfred Hitchcock's Tom Curtain is masterfully directed; and, the otherwise more sunnily disposed Newman and Andrews are surprisingly effective. Their lesser known supporting players are appropriately chilling - especially the electrifying Wolfgang Kieling (as Hermann Gromek); his ghastly expiration scene is a classic. Mr. Hitchcock received some bad rap for his Torn Curtain; as, understandably, reviewers held his films to increasingly difficult to attain expectations. Still, Hitchcock and crew create an extraordinary frosty, paranoiac Cold War spy chiller.The film might have been perfected with some additional characterization given for Newman and Andrews to work with; either or both of their characters might have had an intriguing past relationship with, perhaps, the Ballerina (Tamara Toumanova) or the Countess (Lila Kedrova).

Things change with Torn Curtain, which is overt Cold War propaganda, and as such there is naturally a little more delving into specifics and real world intrigues. However we are thankfully spared any political sermonising or gung ho flag-waving. In fact the setting allows for some good spins on the tired old 39 Steps formula, as we get the added tension of our hero being behind enemy lines.And this one contains some decent Hitchcockian suspense sequences. The well-known murder scene is one of the few moments in the director's 60s output that has the intensity of his earlier classics, exciting yet disturbing in its content. The fact that the two collaborators in this murder do not speak each other's language makes for a nice touch, as they appear more brutal in their wordless co-operation. The escape sequence with the bus journey towards the end is also a great bit of old-fashioned Hitchcockian race-against-time constructions. Hitch shows his adeptness in building a certain kind of structure, for example the prominence he gives to that spiky ballet dancer on the plane, making us recognise her when she becomes important later on. Notice how this picture (like The Birds and Marnie) is in the 133 aspect ratio, even though it was all but obsolete by this point. Many of the older directors preferred the old academy ratio (as it was known), but Hitchcock was one of the few who carried enough weight to get his way. And he really makes good use of it, taking advantage of its height in relation to width for example in the lecture theatre scene where Professor Lindt first appears at the top of the screen. He's also able to compose those extreme close-ups of the two leads kissing whereby their heads take up the entire frame &#x96; you couldn't do that in widescreen unless you zoomed right in on their lips.Speaking of the leads however, Paul Newman and Julie Andrews are unusual choices, clearly dropped into their parts purely for their box office appeal as opposed to their actual suitability. They are both good enough in themselves, despite being in roles that demand little from them, Newman in particular managing a very real look of desperation in the aforementioned murder scene. However there is clearly no chemistry between the two of them, and they don't even look right together as a screen couple. With that odd hairdo they give her for this movie Andrews looks older than she is, and Newman still looks very much more the hip young dude than the learned professor. It appears fun was had with the casting of the bad guys, with lots of European expatriates making up a rogues gallery of sinister commies. Lazy stereotyping? Of course - but it suits the comic book pacing and action. Wolfgang Kieling makes a great impact as Gromek, like a cold-hearted Peter Lorre. Ludwig Donath is excellent too as the grouchy Professor Lindt, although he is far too comically likable to be taken for a real baddie.Overall Torn Curtain is a little mediocre, but it has many highpoints. It's a far cry from The Master of Suspense&#x99;'s espionage thriller heyday in the late 1930s (and I'm not saying by the way that this was when he made all his best movies, just that from 1940 to 1960 his best works were his domestic thrillers like Shadow of a Doubt and Rear Window), but it contains a few little touches of what once made his espionage thrillers great. Above all, it is Hitch's ability to make the images compelling and the tension bubbling that allow Torn Curtain to transcend its corny propaganda roots.

It's deliberately slow paced and while in some cases it works,here it kinda backfires. At approximately 128 minutes some scenes could've been cut out easily,it just seemed to drag on endlessly at some points,while being thrilling and engaging at others,and that's what plagued this film the most an unusual amount of inconsistency from Alfred. In most cases Alfred's playful tone in his movies it ends up working out,but it just seemed completely out of place in this film. The subject intrigued me very much,I was actually quite excited to watch this film,especially due to the cast. Apparently Paul and Alfred would often clash on the set due to Alfred's constant demands and agonizing working style,if that was the case Paul did a great job of pulling it out and was the main reason this film was watchable in the 1st place. One scene that stood out in particular to me was Gromek's death scene. It was extremely suspenseful and very well done,I was on the edge of my seat,it was done with terrific Flair and wonderfully executed,but unfortunately after that,things seemed to fall apart. I did like this film to some extent,but it just seemed like a quickie studio project for Alfred Hitchock and his full effort didn't seem to be there.Performances. Paul Newman is excellent as per usual. He carries this film on the weight of his shoulders on a number of occasions with his great delivery,he's charismatic,witty and absolutely engaging to watch while on screen. His chemistry with Julie Andrews while somewhat Corny,was quite decent. Julie Andrews is a bit fluffy,and looked a little lost in some scenes but she managed to be a likable gal and did well with what she had to do. Ludwig Donath is a hoot as Lundt,very unpredictable and often quite lively whenever on screen. Rest of the cast do fine with what they have to do.Bottom Line- Torn Curtain is a curious misfire from Alfed Hitchcock. Maybe Alfred was right,maybe Anthony Perkins was a better fit for this role,but I still don't see how his anger to Newman was justified he carried this film. Torn Curtain is better then it has any right to be,and fellow Hitchcockian devotees will most likely find something worthwhile in this film. I didn't mind it,but I thought it could've been a lot better as well.

The fact that Alfred Hitchcock directed it in itself is worth spending a few hours, two hours and eight minutes to be exact, watching it and trying to figure out just what the movie is all about?American physics professor Michael Armstrong is a bit turned off on his country,the USA,in not financing with millions of tax payer dollars his pet project-Gamma V-that would in effect make nuclear war obsolete. Giving his fianc√©e Sarah a song and dance act in him traveling to Stockholm Sweden for official business Michael in fact plans to defect to Communist East Germany and sell his services to them, the war mongering Communists, in the name of World Peace.Sarah who's suspicious of her handsome and cute, in a manly way, future husband of cheating on her finds out that he's in fact traveling to East Germany not Sweden! Getting on the same plane that Michael is on Sarah is discovered by him just as he's about to depart on the East Berlin Airport's tarmac. In what has to be by far Newman's, as Professor Armstrong, best acting in the movie he adamantly demands Sarah to take the next plane back to West Berlin! It's soon becomes obvious, if it weren't already, that Michael is really a spy, without the authority of the US State Department, for the US! Michaels so-called defection to the Communist East Berlin Government is just a sham in order for him to get in contact with Karl Marx University's top physic professor Gustav Lindt, Ludwig Bonath. Michael plans to pick Prof. Lindt's brains, in a mental sparring session, in order for him to find out what he knows about Gamma V that can in the end help both Michael and the USA perfect it!Having no choice but to have Sarah, who thinks that Michael is a Communist spy, tag along with him, as his assistant in rocket research, Michael's plans in finding out the secrets of Gamma V fall apart almost as soon as they began. It's only that the East German STASI-Secret Police-are so ineffective that Michael gets to see Prof. Lindt and, in a long and boring BS session with him, finds out how it-Gamma V-works! This happens just before the very bright Prof. Lindt suddenly realizes that Michael, who's just bull sh*ting his way through the entire conversation with him, who's supposed to be a genius in the complicated matters of modern rocket propulsion,as well as advanced nuclear physics, is totally ignorant of the subject!With the help of a number of key characters, a bus driver Polish Countess Postal clerk and stage hand with a very obvious and ill fitting red wig, popping up at the right time and in the right place both Michael and Sarah end up making it to safety out of East Germany by sailing, in an East German freighter, to the port of Stockholm Sweden by the time the movie finally ends. The very place that Michael was supposed to travel to before all this mindless intrigue and unintentional comedy happened!You can see right away that pretty and adorable Julie Andrews was totally miscast in the film in her not being able, as hard as she tried, to be believable in her role of Michael's fianc√©e Sarah Sherman. Julie looked lost in most of the scenes that she was in just staring into space and looking as if she was either hypnotized or suffering from a sever case of sleep deprivation.Paul Newman was not at all himself in looking both tired and disgusted in being forced, by his bosses at Universal Studios, to play the part of the genius physics professor-and top rocket scientist- Michael Armstrong. In most of the action sequences in the film where Newman and his fianc√©e Julie Andrews were running for their lives he looked as if he wanted to get caught, and executed, just to have a reason to get out of the movie!

I agree w/ IMDb reviewer blue_orpheus who writes By 1966, Hitchcock was pretty much considered a has-been. But while Torn Curtain didn't help change that perception (in fact, it only confirmed it), it's not nearly as bad as some critics will have you believe.Not all Hitchcock films can be successes like Psycho or Strangers on a Train. Eastwood or Spielberg don't always bat homers. This film requires slower pacing much like Preminger's Rosebud. Newman's character's defection revolves around a pre-SDI nuclear-bomb shield amazingly twenty years before Reagan promoted the idea in the 80's.For anyone who has traveled to a Communist country, that initial sense of overwhelming societal displacement is common (when freedom is not a given right). Andrews' character communicates that in her performance (especially given she is clueless about why her lover has defected). The scene where the secret formula is extracted and how it is revealed is priceless. Especially when the older sly-fox Prof Lind realizes he's been out-foxed! He lamely proclaims to Newman I forbid you to leave this room! Yeah, like that's going to work! I didn't find the musical score that horrible and it would have distracted if used in the farmhouse murder scene.BTW Is that Liv Ullman's secret twin as the farmer's wife/co-murderer?

It is not a bad film, but overall, it is not involving or very suspenseful except for the one scene in the farmhouse.  None of the actors were bad; you just don't care what happens to them.  At the beginning, I wanted Julie Andrews to stop Paul Newman from going to East Berlin.  Of course, she didn't and there was still an hour and a half left for me to sit through.One thing I didn't like was the way the colors looked.  Everything seemed gray and drab.  In the 50's, Hitchcock's color films literally shined with bright colors.  Perhaps the images in Marnie were dull too, but it fit the tone of the movie.  Torn Curtain doesn't have that type of personality, so the picture quality doesn't enhance it at all.Torn Curtain broke no new ground although it continued the trend of using what was considered graphic violence at the time - this is confined to one scene.  Hitchcock fans will want to see it because it is directed by the master, but it's nothing monumental.There are some distinct Hitchcock touches I enjoyed, like his cameo, and his trademark the protagonist hiding in a bathroom, as well as the farmhouse scene I mentioned before.  But it wasn't enough to consider it a classic like so many of his other films.  I suppose this movie is Hitchcock's response to the spymania - most notably the James Bond films, but it should've been more suspenseful and intriguing.  At least the theatre scene had some suspense - but what was up with Tamara Toumanova?  She seemed so weird.  At least Hitchcock recovered to make his next film a better spy thriller - Topaz, and a few years later, his shocking Frenzy.

The film isn't nearly as bad as the legendary director made it out to be, although there's no doubt that it's not a classic by any stretch of the imagination. As for Hitchcock's hatred, I'm going to guess he spoke even worse about the film simply because the studio didn't give him the cast he wanted.As far as the film goes, it's pretty entertaining and I think Hitchcock was wrong when he criticized the two lead performers. Yes, I think both Newman and Andrews are quite good here and they're certainly believable as the couple behind the Iron Curtain trying to find a way out. I thought Newman was very believable in the role of the scientist and I think Andrews does good during her more emotional scenes. Lila Kedrova, Hansjorg Felmy and Wolfgang Kieling are also very good in their supporting roles.The film also benefits from some nice cinematography and a good music score. As for the flaws, there's no question that the story itself really isn't anything fresh or original. In fact, the spy genre was at full force during this era due to the James Bond movies so TORN CURTAIN does feel a tad bit old fashioned and its story just seems like something that would have been better twenty years earlier. Also the 128 minute running time is a bit too long. With that said, the cast is good and there are some nice suspense scenes so TORN CURTAIN is still worth watching.

But then, after Paul Newman and his wife are both aware of the same situation - since in the first half of the movie they're not - the situation being they are both in trouble and must leave Russia - and originally that Newman wasn't what he pretended to be - the movie falls apart, quick. It turns from a cool spy flick into a Disney-like chase film, which is, for the most part, still kind of fun and entertaining. But if the entire movie held up as well as the first half, this would be classic Hitchcock. Same thing goes for the movie he made right after this, another long espionage film that I forget the name of, but that was, for the first half, really good, and then falls apart. Sidenote It's great that Hitchcock would later make a comeback with FRENZY, which is his second to last film but should still be regarded as his swan song project. Back at hand I do recommend this film, TORN CURTAIN. The shots are terrific, even though you can tell most of the outdoor locations are sets. The acting is good, and it won't be a waste of your time or money.

The two most-menacing characters working for the E German dictatorship are Heinrich (Himmler?) Gerhardt and Hermann (Goering?) Gromek, two opposite personalities both working toward a common goal retaining absolute control of the populace and all those who may visit. Gromek is portrayed chillingly as a policeman- bully who is always on the knife-edge of committing some sort of violence, very similar to the personality of a Gestapo agent with unlimited powers to torture and spy, assigned to make friends with a suspect. The scene where Newman is forced to kill Gromek still gives viewers nausea, even though we're glad that the jerk is dead. And, how does Gromek die? By lethal gas, no less! No one misses the point here - victims of the Nazi's would have loved to dispatch their tormentors this way - give 'em a shot of their own medicine so to speak! Gerhardt is smooth, educated & sophisticated but no less trouble for the phony-defector Professor Armstrong as he tries to escape this lovely place East Germany.Hitch made this film because he and others of his generation recognized the oh-so-obvious parallels between fascism and communism as practiced by all those jolly men east of the iron curtain. Having lived through WWII and witnessed the energetic rise of comrade stalin who aped so many of herr Hitler's obsessions and methods, Hitchcock paints a vivid portrait of the grimness of life under erich honnecker and his band of commo-nazi's. Only East Germans for a few days, Professor Armstrong and his fianc√© feel keenly the dread of government and the absence of freedom that always formed a backdrop to the lives of humans forced to live there.A classic characterization not to be missed is Professor Lindt, Chairman of Nuclear Physics at Karl Marx University. He is portrayed as part folksy grandfather anxious to take the younger Armstrong under his wing, part veteran womanizer, part gracious host and part brilliant scientist with an insatiable curiosity on par with an Einstein. So great is Lindt's anxiety to see how western research is progressing toward making nuclear war a thing of the past that he lets his guard down and circumvents the typical restrictions of E German official life, only to find his own research stolen by the engaging and nimble Dr. Armstrong.I thoroughly enjoyed Paul Newman's Dr. Armstrong, who is petulant, cold-blooded and a reasonably good deceiver for an amateur. All on his own, Armstrong defects to E Germany, gushing the all-too-typical commie propaganda of the day - the west is full of warmongering hard- right-wing savages, NATO forces scientists to do only research for aggressive warfare, the U.S. only exists to accommodate a capitalist world-empire, etc. etc. We are a trifle stunned at hearing this, as is Armstrong's fianc√©, who has followed him incognito for most of his airplane ride. Later we learn that Armstrong is a self-made spy whose Univ of Chicago research team hit a dead end building a pre-SDI nuclear-bomb shield and he's determined to see if scientists behind the Iron Curtain have more-advanced research on the subject. Once Armstrong wins his prize, he's already been discovered as an enemy of the Reich, sorry, an enemy of the Peoples Democratic Republic of Germany, and is already being chased by zhee authorities.The chase lasts for the last 1/3 of the film and is a little tedious in places. Still, danger of capture lurks close-by during much of the chase sequences and puts the audience appropriately on edge.

The problem isn't that it's a bad movie, just a weak one.Newman stars as Professor Michael Armstrong, an American scientist of some repute who had been working on an anti-missile system. Given the film is set at the height of the Cold War, his work is naturally looked upon with interest by the Eastern Bloc, so when he suddenly flies to East Berlin and announces he is defecting to pursue his project for the glory of socialist democracy, he is greeted with open arms. His girlfriend and assistant, Sarah Sherman (Julie Andrews), is upset by his betrayal but opts to stand by her man.From the nondescript fuzzy-blue titles sequence to the dopey musical score to the true reasons for Armstrong's defection, Torn Curtain is a film of dull compromises and obvious disengagement by the central players. No screen actor ever combined intensity and charisma as well as Newman, yet here you get neither. His Armstrong is a cold fish who stares at the ground a lot and stoicly ignores his girlfriend's unlimited devotion.Hitchcock is even more of a surprise; he seems brought down by the grayness of the locale in which his film is set. There are remarkable moments in this film, and remarkably prosaic ones, too. Take the opening, aboard a cruise ship where Armstrong is preparing to give a conference. Usually Hitchcock films whisk us right into something unusual or exciting. Here you get tedious exposition, lame jokes, and a force-fed tryst between Newman and Andrews as frosted and artificial as Andrews' bouffant hairdo.They do say their lines well enough, and Andrews, an actress of limited range, struggles gamely with the lame material she is given. So docile is she that when the East German authorities taking Armstrong away confront her with the question What are we going to do with you? her reply is What do you suggest? Lorena Bobbitt she is not.Wolfgang Kieling is the only performer who sticks out here; playing a security man named Gromek who watches over Armstrong with attempted joviality. He's equal parts bully and puppy dog, a bit sad for the way he holds onto stray bits of outdated American slang and tries them out on the professor, having no idea of how lame he comes off. Gromek's not one to underestimate, though, as Armstrong discovers in a confrontation that is the film's best moment. At one point, facing down Armstrong and a knife-wielding woman, Gromek tells Armstrong Tell the cookie to put that down. She's going to cut your fingers off. We lose Gromek shortly after, and the film never finds anything as interesting to occupy us thereafter.Most of the other performances are flat, not that I blame them; if Newman can't shine, why should Hansjorg Felmy? The worst is turned in by Lila Kedrova, one of two 1965 Oscar winners in the cast (Andrews being the other). She overplays the role of a hard-luck countess as if she was being paid by the grimace. She's laughing! Now she's crying! Now she's squealing with joy! Eartha Kitt chewed less scenery playing Catwoman. I blame Hitchcock, who could have told Kedrova to tone it down, especially opposite Zombie Paul. Instead he just lets her spin, another sign he didn't care.Yes, there are good scenes, when you get past the long stretches of nothing between them, scenes that stick out in your memory. Hitchcock was always great at scenes. Problem is, he was usually great at movies, too, but Torn Curtain is one time he couldn't seem to give a rip. It's hard for a viewer to feel much different.

Of the uncountably many ways in which this movie is pathetic, nothing can really compete with the very fact that I was forced to divide it into two parts, on two separate days, to get through the whole tedious, tiresome, retarded thing. But even then, I found the last fifty minutes nearly unbearable.Replete with clich√©s, stereotypes, anti-communist propaganda; devoid of any suspense or humor; and marred by myriad illogicalities, TORN CURTAIN is a waste of time and an embarrassment to the memory of Alfred Hitchcock.Perhaps the worst scene of all was the Buono and Bianchi-like murder of Gromek, early on in the film. Gratuitously awful and devoid of any dramatic purpose whatsoever beyond--I guess--demonstrating that patriotism may sometimes require that one adopt the modus operandi and mindset of Henry Lee Lucas?! But the nonsense unfortunately did not stop there. Instead, for over two hours the viewer is treated with a childish plot and the diaphanous and entirely predictable antics of moronic--but highly patriotic!--protagonists. Newman is too stupid to solve his own math equation, but more clever than the man who can--because he's a communist?! Okay...

It's a routine cold war thriller, barely distinguishable from countless others made around the time of it's making. It's competent, and might even seem pretty good if it was not a Hitchcock film, but because it is, one expects so much more than what is on offer here.The Master of Suspense just seems uninterested in the film and is just going through the motions. Some have said that about Marnie, his previous film, but like it or not that film had style to spare. Torn Curtain seemingly has no style. The story plods along in a way just enough to keep one vaguely interested, but there is little suspense or emotion. We care little about the main characters, and Paul Newman and Julie Andrews have absolutely no chemistry.Many dialogue scenes in the first half could have been cut completely with no harm to the film. Of course the famous scene when Newman and a woman try to kill a man and find it much harder than expected, is still memorable, and the final third has two well handled scenes- a bus pursuit and an escape during a ballet performance.Tron Curtain is visually dull, and is hampered by a score that sometimes becomes jaunty during supposedly suspenseful scenes as is well known, Bernard Herrmann's score was rejected but it available on CD and would have helped the film a bit. No ,it's by no means a bad film. However, it's definitely bad Hitchcock.

There's an uncertainty of tone, as if the great man didn't quite know the kind of movie he wanted to make. Bernard Herrmann knew listen to what exists of his score and suddenly TORN CURTAIN seems to be about something, to matter. But Hitch fired Benny. As a result, all the cracks show.The biggest crack of all is not the script, which usually gets the blame. It's the sheer impossibility of Julie Andrews and Paul Newman as a couple. Pressed upon Hitchcock by the studio, these two stars, so remarkable in their own ways, are stylistically incompatible. Newman specialises in hidden depths; Andrews' strength is her highly-polished surface. Whatever they're given to do together, they're in two different movies. Having said all that, this is nonetheless a work of a master, and there are inevitably moments to admire (an overhead shot as Newman walks among cleaning ladies that cranes to reveal - no, I won't give it away!), ideas to marvel at (the pursuit of Newman through a museum which seems to have been borrowed and improved upon by Wes Anderson in THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL), and set pieces to applaud (the famous scene in which we are shown how difficult it is to commit a murder). There is also joy to be had from the supporting players, with memorable turns from Ludwig Donath, David Opatashu, Wolfgang Kieling and Lila Kedrova. But the balance is not on the side of the good stuff. Hitch's fondness for process shots instead of locations date TORN CURTAIN in an unhelpful way, especially when a contemporary film such as THE QUILLER MEMORANDUM gains so much (and feels so much fresher) from having made good use of its Berlin setting.

Although I must agree with many others that Julie Andrews is miscast and possibly not well directed (why couldn't she be convincing in love here when it worked in Sound of music?), most other aspects of the first half of the film works well. Getting into East Germany turns out to be a lot more exciting than getting out. First we don't really know whether prof Armstrong is defecting or making a double act. Then we don't really, really know if the slimy bodyguard Gromek (Wolfgang Kieling) is there to stop them from escaping or, having formerly lived USA, is there to help them. He is also a strong character both in tension and humor. His comments about American culture and food are very entertaining. You can't really decide whether to hate or like him.But after Gromek leaves the story six feet below (after the best action scene in the movie), the only person who keeps things rolling is professor Lindt (Ludwig Donath). The final scene with him, writing formulas on the blackboard, is vital but still makes me a bit uneasy. They should really discuss principles and ideas, not just write formulas like on some kind of math lecture. It is a key scene of the movie and I feel that it, at least partially, resorts to the stupid idea that science is all about finding the magic formula.From that point, I feel that I have seen it all before. Was this movie truly early with the the theme of smuggling people out from behind the iron curtain? Maybe I feel that after watching Secret Army a lot later, but if so, we shouldn't blame this movie, but surely there were others before this? Speaking of smuggling, a disturbing omission on that point is, in my opinion, that we get to know nothing of the destiny of those who helped them who are revealed and arrested (like the person who was hurt leaving the bus and other people who must have been easily identified). Don't we care?The countess (Lila Kedrova) is thrown in as some extra spice, but she is just annoying, over-acting and not at all the charming colorful easter Europe character she is planned to be.All that really happens is that the heroes are happily delivered to the Swedish coast, happy ending. Oh yes, the cameo by Jan Malmsj√∂ (famous Swedish actor and singer) as photographer is a plus that lifts the ending a little bit.All in all, not an awful movie by any means, quite good up to a point, but very far from Hitchcock's best or any first rate thriller.

Put it this way -- if you wanted an accurate remake of this film in the year 2001, it would probably star George Clooney and Tori Spelling.Newman's great -- when he's the main character in the scene.  There's a scene with him explaining stuff on a chalkboard that's absolutely priceless.  When he's not the main character in a scene, though, he looks bored, almost like he's waiting for the caterer to show up. Newman does a pretty good job, but it was the first time I ever noticed him just mailing in a performance, at least part of the time.It's a bad film with a few great highlights.

That aside, and not to demean these accomplishments, the rest of the film is a bit of a mess.Paul Newman is an American math professor who is sent, with his assistant Julie Andrews, to East Germany as a faux defector to the Soviet bloc. His mission Pick the brain of Ludwig Donath, as Professor Lindt, the biggest physics brain in East Berlin. Then he and Andrews must escape by complicated means and get back to safety.There are a handful of outstanding scenes that demonstrate Hitchcock's range as he aged. He was about sixty-five when this was shot, but he was beginning to feel depressed and was putting away a lot of booze, all of which combined to impair his judgment. Here are some, in no particular order.The East German security agents who follow Newman around after his defection aren't bad guys. They're serious about their work, genuinely courteous, they're not ugly, they're neatly groomed, and some have a sense of humor. They're the kind of security agents we would wish to have. Newman and a farmer's wife are forced by circumstances to murder one of them in an isolated house. The poor guy, wisecracking all along, is strangled, stabbed in the neck, beaned with a shovel, banged on the shins, and finally gassed to death with his head in an oven. Hitchcock made it deliberately unpleasant because, as he said, he wanted to show how difficult it was to kill someone. In this he succeeded.In another scene, Newman cons Donath into revealing the secrets he knows about some physics notion behind missile development. The concept, it's called. Donath, by the way, is another regular guy. He enjoys music, wine, and young women. The scene resembles that in which Klaatu instructs Professor Barnard in celestial mechanics, if you know what I mean. Some of the same dialog seems to be reproduced. Of course this is only the MacGuffin, but it's one MacGuffin I'd have liked to know more about.Towards the end, a fake bus is trailed by the real one that is being imitated. It's pretty suspenseful, and the score helps.Newman and Andrews are in the audience at the ballet when they realize they've been identified as spies and the police are closing in. A man in a public place with no means of escape. The director has been here before -- The Thirty-Nine Steps, North by Northwest, et al. Even Newman has been here, independent of Hitchcock, in The Prize. So how does Newman get out? He stands up and shouts FIRE! And immediately -- immediately meaning like in two seconds -- the entire audience is screaming and struggling towards the exits, even in the absence of any sign of smoke, let alone fire. Deus ex plastic flames. It falls entirely flat.A good deal of screen time is given over to Lila Kedrova as an exiled Polish countess stuck in East Berlin. She gets multiple close ups. Why, I don't know. Her antics are supposed to be amusing and pathetic at the same time. They're just pitiful. She comes across as a neural shambles.I don't want to get into the plot further, except to say that there are no humorous moments in it and no scenes in which food plays an important part. The supporting players are, for the most part, better than we have a right to expect, but the principals don't bring much to the party. Julie Andrews is saucy and pert and isn't asked to do much. However, this is one of Paul Newman's infrequent failures. He and Hitchcock didn't get along -- at all. Hitchcock by this time, although always polite, expected obedience from his actors. Newman was a graduate of the Actor's Studio and expected to work out the role in concert with his director. Hitchcock swore never to work with name actors again, and he never did. The director also had a very unpleasant conflict with his usual composer -- Bernard Hermann, who was as temperamental as Hitchcock was dictatorial. Hitchcock fired Hermann and they never worked together again, a sad and practically wordless parting.It's a sad film in many ways.

By Hitchcock's standards, it's a completely laughable and badly shot bit of action. But the sustained and slow approach of the knife obviously inspired Brian De Palma's similarly subjective approach of the drill and approach of the saw scenes in Body Double and Scarface.By the time Hitchcock got to this stage in his career, times had changed. Audiences no longer bought his quaint little thrillers. Hitchcock gives us a knife stabbing flesh in glorious color and expects us to be jolted....but these things are no longer shocking or thrilling. They're just silly, audience desensitization exposing Hitchcock's technique for the kind of crass string pulling it always was.No wonder De Palma had to come along and juice things up. You want an approaching knife in slow, subjective, motion? Screw that. De Palma gives you a powerdrill and blazing chainsaw, slowly edging toward you at 2 frames per second!Torn Curtain also features a chase through an ornate museum, but it's one of the worst chases in Hithcock's career. Here we see how dry his photography is when he doesn't have Bernard Herrmann to highlight the action or provide exclamation points to guide his editing.The chase plays like this Newman enters one room, hears footsteps, looks behind him and then enters another room. He then hears footsteps again, looks behind him and then enters another room. This goes on and on for about 12 rooms. Add the fact that each room is shot with a tripod mounted stagnant camera and you honestly have the worst chase in cinema history.But anyway, my point is that this scene, and the more fluid museum scene in Vertigo, provided the framework for Brian De Palma's use of architecture throughout his entire filmography. The Classical Beaux-Arts architecture style, with it's large open spaces, expansive hallways, symmetry and pillars, is perfect for De Palma's elegant camera moves and spatial fetishes.But aside from these 2 points, Torn Curtain represents the Master at his worst. The leads have no chemistry, the villains are cartoonish, the acting is stilted and the film has no tension, pace or thrills. The music is also quite terrible. But I guess you can learn all this by reading other reviews.2/10 - The Big Man must have been asleep. This film is completely worthless.

Suspense levels are pretty low, actual scenes of violence and action are very few, which is probably why this one doesn't have a great reputation. Performances are good, however.

But that murder scene - what a part!","Date":"8 November 2014","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Thriller","Review":" Torn Curtain is a good little Cold War story involving unlikely spies and lots of traveling through European countries. And of course the thing you'll hear about is that one major set-piece, in the middle of the film, where a Character (with a Capital C) comes over to where Newman and Andrews are trying to lay low, and the first thing is the tension. It's what isn't said here that cuts like a knife, how Newman tries to keep up the cover and the other guy can just sense, taste, what this man is lying about. Finally the struggle happens, and the man is hit on the head. But that's not all. It's the Master of Suspense stretching what he could do in 1966 (the 'Code' was finally loosening, just a little), and it's graphic, rough, and a mini-masterpiece.The rest of the film is... alright. It's not completely forgettable as far as spy thrillers with espionage in the 60's goes, nor a crime against humanity. But, Julie Andrews was miscast here for sure. Paul Newman does okay actually, better than I expected as a professor-turned-Cold-War flip-flopper - though he's not, I think, who cares really - but their on-screen chemistry isn't very strong, which is the film's biggest flaw, especially for the material this filmmaker is working with here. If Newman had a stronger woman to work off of, a different sex appeal or a more realistic counterpart (maybe one of the stars of one of the European waves could have helped), but here...Hitchcock, I think, got this as well, so he got more pleasure out of side/supporting characters, like Ludwig Donath as Prof. Gustav Lindt or the German woman with the colorful scarf who needs a sponsor. It's not a bad movie by any stretch, and it has a nice wonderfully obvious Hitchcock twist (actually a couple) in the last reel. But Torn Curtain could've been more. It's a soup that needed more attention, or another lead actress.

Instead, you have wooden performances by Newman and Andrews. Add to it backgrounds that are so unrealistic looking that they are obviously Hollywood stages with artificial lighting and uncreative photography.Worst of all is the plot. The so-called excitement or tension predominantly arises from an unbelievably stupid slip-up by Newman. He draws the mathematical symbol for Pi in the sand of a farmhouse to indicate to a non-English speaking German woman the purpose of his visit. She then introduces him to his contact, but he doesn't erase the symbol with his foot, which any idiot would do, no less a supposedly brilliant scientist.As a result, the East German surveillance bad guy sees the symbol, so he has to be bumped off, and all the subsequent chases derive from this single piece of Newman's stupidity. I would have thought that a film late in Hitchcock's career would have had more substance, and from all standpoints, been creatively better. I skimmed through parts of it, since the dialogue was pretty uninspired and there wasn't much to miss.

I wouldn't review this, when it has so many reviews already, but I just wanted to add my two cents. I did read other reviews, one praising this and another bashing it and I'm on the side of criticizing it. I'd like to give Hitchcock the benefit of the doubt, but this film pretty much lies there. Except for a few action scenes and some chasing, there's practically no real suspense. It does somehow keep the viewer's interest in the beginning, but after the cancelled meeting at the hour mark of the film, it does downhill fast. The worst thing about it is we simply don't care about the lead characters, because they're just cardboard characters and so two-dimensional. Sure they're shown all lovey-dovey and romantic, but they don't come across as real people, just pawns in this mysterious case of Paul, who's a scientist, defecting to find out formulas to make the atomic bomb obsolete. The real kicker is the introduction of Countess Kuchinska, played by Lila Kedrova, in the last half hour of the film. If she wasn't in the movie, I could simply ignore this picture completely. Her seven minutes on the screen is the best thing about this film, bar none. If the rest of the film hadn't been such a snoozefest, she might would gotten more attention from the Oscars. But one never knows. She needs a sponsor to get out of the country and Lila's performance simply breaks your heart. When you see her on the steps, distraught, you ache for her and want them to go back for her. But they had their own problems. If you want to see Torn Curtain, you have to watch all of it for an Oscar-worthy performance by Lila Kedrova. Otherwise, see North by Northwest first.

An American nuclear scientist defects to East Berlin, offering his experience on an anti-missile technology, prompting Andrews(this may be the only thing I've seen her in... is she always this irritating?), his secretary, to whine on and on about patriotism(why is it that we are expected to be on the side of whatever country we happened to be born in, regardless of what our conscience tells us? I thought we were in the age of individuality). Ah, no worries, it's a cover story. He's still working for the US; he's there to find out what a rival of his there has determined about, well, the same theory, basically. One can tell that this is done by Hitchcock... however, it was also the worst experience he had filming, neither lead(they're decent together, and Newman isn't bad) were his choice, and this is among the most simplistic of his. It's too based on action. No complexity, no interesting themes, and only a few memorable scenes(the infamous oven sequence). The tension and suspense are great at times. Still, this is boring and repetitive at times. Denmark is seen, which is cool(and no, I can't explain why we have a hotel here, the name of which, in French, means England). The score is grand. German is spoken, not subtitled, and far from everyone sound like they come from where they're supposed to. Some of the dialog is good. There is disturbing content and bloody violence in this. The DVD comes with a making of featurette and one about Bernard Hermann, in spite of this being the falling out between him and Alfred(I will review both of these on their own pages here on the site), production photos and a trailer.

Not because later movies were actually worse than earlier ones, but rather because the same cheap work feels even cheaper when the director becomes a high-profile one.The film is fun to watch, but porn is fun to watch too. You just can't call either art or have much respect for the creators. In order for you to enjoy it, you have to completely shut your brain down and accept that they will leave directions for the American spy at the post office written in German(!!), that the best escape plan would involve sending him and his fianc√©e -both can't speak German- to a crowded theatre in a city suspicious of foreigners, that even though his face was all over the news only one eccentric woman would recognise him, that his claim to be visiting a relative in a farm would not be laughed at immediately, or that they would bring his obnoxious scientific foe to the theatre during the slow and unrealistic arrest attempt. And these are just few highlights of the stupidity we are asked to believe.The film is full of last minute escapes, amazing coincidences, and that ballerina seems to be everywhere knowing everything!These are all signs of total lack of talent and creativity. Imagine what if the 11 juries in 12 Angry Men just decided to follow Henry Fonda's not-guilty verdict immediately with no explanation and that was the film! This is why artistic liberty should stay within the boundaries of logic, or else it's nothing but a cheap mess made only to make a quick dollar at the box office. This is exactly what this film is.The atmosphere is enjoyable, and the sets have that vintage feel to them even though film making had moved past these when thew film was made. The shot of the exterior of the museum in Berlin is such a good example of a 1940's effect that made its way into a mid 60s movie. Acting too was quite vintage, and the chemistry between the two leads was weak but not completely lacking.Overall a good way to kill a little under 2 hours. Watch it and have a laugh at Hitchcok's fan-boys who would undoubtedly call it a classic.
