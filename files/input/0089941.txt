Rebecca de Mournay is layered into the mix, as is the indefatigable John P. Ryan as a prison warden who risks death to return his charges to custody, but the movie belongs to Voight and Roberts who both bring tremendous humanity to their finely sketched characters.The final image is as powerful as cinema gets and marks RUNAWAY TRAIN as a modest masterpiece.Though often criticized for producing cheap rubbish, the Cannon Group, in fact, also produced many fine films including this, 52 PICK-UP and MARIA'S LOVERS (also Konchalovsky).

An intellectual action flick!","Date":"14 April 1999","Score":"85 out of 112 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":"  Runaway Train is about far more than a runaway train.  It is about personal freedom and how hard we are willing to struggle to get it.  It's about how willing we are to give up our personal freedom to be comfortable.  It's about dehumanization inflicted by social institutions. It's also one gripping, suspenseful action-flick.  The two main characters, played by Jon Voight as Manny and Eric Roberts as Buck, are escaped prisoners, but they are humanized.  Not that we would really like to meet them, but we can see how they work, and we can identify with them.  I found it fascinating that the character I really hated was John P. Ryan as Renkin, the warden.  This official of society has turned his efforts to recapture the prisoners, particularly Manny, into a personal mission of hatred. The cinematography and imagery in the film are excellent.  Whether exterior shots of the train hurtling across the desolate Canadian wilderness, or claustrophobic shots of the characters in the train, we are there and cannot help but be involved. There's not a bad performance in it.  John Voight, Eric Roberts, Rebecca De Mornay and John P. Ryan are all tremendous, with an intensity that matches the demands of the film. This is one of those few films that really disturbed me, that really caused me to think about my life. It is unforgettable.  It is a great work of art.

This combination makes it all that much more suspenseful and powerful. For me it could well be the best action movie of all time. Interestingly enough it's based on a screenplay by Kurosawa, but criminal turned novelist Edward Bunker (who plays Jonah here but is best known to most people as Mr. Blue in 'Reservoir Dogs') gets the main writing credit. Jon Voight gives one of his very best performances as Manny, but Eric Roberts is also just great. Roberts is overlooked these days, making too many b-grade and straight-to-video movies to be taken seriously, but boy, back in the day this guy was GOOD! Check him out here, and in 'Star 80', and especially 'The Pope Of Greenwich Village' with Mickey Rourke. Roberts actually scored an Oscar nomination for 'Runaway Train'. Just why his career subsequently went in the direction it did is one of the great mysteries of Hollywood. Voight and Roberts are supported by Rebecca De Mornay, super tough guy John P. Ryan ('It's Alive') and well loved character actor Kenneth McMillan. Also keep an eye out for Danny Trejo in the boxing sequence towards the very beginning of the film. 'Runaway Train' is a movie I never tire of watching.

The escape of two prisoners, Manny & Buck, who jump on a train only to find that the driver has a heart attack, thus it speeds out of control. Then there is the efforts of the train dispatching office to try and safely stop the out-of-control train. And also there's the hunt by the sadistic prison warden who is hellbent on recapturing the fleeing convicts.Relentless and engrossing action film from start to finish, Runaway Train boasts two Oscar nominated performances from John Voight Manny and Eric Roberts Buck and no little intelligence with its well scripted characters. The opening quarter is pretty stock routine prison fare, these guys are tough, the warden is a bastard and we just know they are going to escape. But once the guys board the train the whole film shifts in gear and tone. The dynamic that exists between Manny & Buck, partners but very different in life approach, is riveting stuff courtesy of the nifty dialogue exchanges. Things are further enhanced by the appearance of Rebecca DeMornay's also stranded railway worker, Sara, who far from being a shoe-horned token female character, is the crucial piece of the emotional jigsaw. He presence gives the guys room to exorcise their demons and pour out their feelings of anger, bravado and mistrust.The action scenes are very well handled by director Andrei Konchalovsky and his crew. As the train hurtles thru the snowy Alaskan wilderness we are treated to a number of crash bang wallops involving the train itself; derring-do from our boys on the icy outside of the locomotive, and a helicopter pursuit chartered by the obsessed John P. Ryan as Warden Ranken particularly stand out. Bona fide action sequences that are executed skilfully. Then we get to the finale, a finale pumped up for emotional impact, both visually and orally it closes the film justly. We even get time for a bit of Will Shakespeare as we go about reflecting on what we have just witnessed.

Runaway Train is not a perfect film, some of the minor supporting performances are really awful and some viewers may find Eric Roberts to be irritating, but the sheer kineticism, among the other stronger elements, makes it worthwhile.  Often called an intellectual action picture, it's more of an existential one, i.e. man versus a indifferent/hostile universe, etc.  Everything in the film has a greater, more universal meaning, and it's not rocket science to figure out what stands for what.  The simplicity of its metaphors doesn't dull the impact of Runaway Train as a sensory experience, though, because it's still pretty potent stuff.

This fine movie doesn't take its thrills out of the fact there are two escaped convicts inside a runaway train. What's really thrilling is meeting two characters like Manny and Buck, watching them act and talk and understanding their complex personas.Join Voight gives a fantastic performance as Manny, a toughened, ruthless convict whose only motivation is to escape prison; truth is, Manny is a bigger-than-life person who can't be confined, and yet he's a human monster who doesn't have a place on Earth either the tragic ending he meets is most fitting.And Eric Roberts proves he can act after all - his role as Buck, a young loud-mouth who worships Manny as a role-model, and is full of mannerisms is a great contrast to the weary, bitter Manny. What's great is that their relationship is explored to the last consequences once they find themselves in a runaway train - and it's not until then that we finally find out what a horrible human being Manny really is.I enjoyed this movie very much - I expected a cheap thriller, and instead got a careful character study, enhanced by the straightforward, simplistic plot - which is however smarter than many others I've ever seen. It is true the best stories are the simplest ones editing, cinematography, sound and directing are just outstanding in Runaway Train.This is an action movie that doesn't dumb down the plot or insult the viewer's intelligence.

It sounds as if Ben Johnson should be at the controls and Charles Bronson should be the expert who figures out how to save all the passengers except the nut-case villain, maybe Dennis Hopper, who expires along with all the machinery in an exploding fireball as the locomotive plummets from an open bridge into a ravine. But, nope. Kurasawa was having his problems at the time he supervised the writing of this story and it was given over to Konchalavsky to direct. There aren't very many characters in the film. Mainly John Voight, Eric Roberts, and Rebecca DeMornay (looking fresh faced, freckled, and quite attractive), with John Ryan thrown in mainly to provide a real flesh-and-blood living villain, in addition to the impalpable philosophical ones that are everyone's chief concern. Existentialism is one of those now practically-dead passing French intellectual fads, become a word now loosely thrown around that can mean pretty much anything you want. But in its original post-war form it had a rather specific definition, if you could distill it from Sartre and Camus. The main point was that existence precedes essence, meaning that you weren't born for any particular purpose -- good or bad -- and that you defined yourself through voluntary actions. The second point was that social rules meant very little and could be disregarded at will, as long as you were ready to accept the consequences of breaking those rules. This whole movie illustrates exactly those points in a symbolic, yet realistic and exciting way. Voight and Roberts are introduced in a rather lengthy, suspenseful introduction set in a Northwestern prison run by Ryan. They escape by slipping naked through a long and filthy sewer pipe and are shot out through the air into a clear cold fast-running river. (Getting an anatomical allusion here?) They manage to steal some clothes and board the empty, second locomotive of a train whose sole engineer drops dead and falls off. (The engineer stands for Somebody, too, with a capital S. I hope you're getting all this.) Another passenger is discovered. Always nice to have a young woman around. But with nobody at the controls of the unreachable lead locomotive, and with its brakes burned out, the train begins to pick up speed. The three of them wind up stuck on a train rocketing in the general direction of nowhere and, try as they may, they have no influence over its course or speed. Worst of all, it's rapidly approaching a dead end (get that one?). By means of ingenuity, sacrifice, and simple human doggedness the lead locomotive is uncoupled from the rest of the train. While the remaining cars slowly roll to a halt, the lone locomotive roars towards its finish. We don't see the expectable slow-motion drop and explosion for the simple reason that we don't need to. We already know the end is upon us -- I mean upon the train. And the final image, of Voight standing alone atop this hurtling monster of speed, weight, and power, holding his arms upward in defiance, the air filled with huge flakes of wet snow, is finish enough. You don't need a fireball after that climactic shot.I'm afraid I've made this movie out to be some sort of dumb, talky, too-long allegory -- but believe me, it's not. The simple narrative itself is riveting. I can hardly remember another movie in which the performers seemed so terribly cold and uncomfortable, wrapped in rags, caps pulled in an unsightly way around their ears, their faces flushed by the whistling wind, their fear and desperation so visible in everything they do, their failures and minor triumphs looming so pathetically large in the story. This train -- or the compartment of the locomotive, which is about all of the interior we see -- has no oysters on the half shell, nor a nice warm Franklin stove or any other source of heat. It's nothing more than cold, dull iron, and we are all aboard, bound for the end of the line. The musical score couldn't be more apt -- sustained, low, rumbling, elephantine -- a massive and powerful and inexorable chord. What a gripping picture. How did Goldang Globus Hystericus ever manage to produce such a great film?

Surprise! Golon-Globus actually made at least one excellent movie outside of the their usual roster of shlock. But their poor reputation might have become so tarnished by that time that audiences didn't get a chance to know what they were missing. As a result, the movie rarely if ever gets airplay or any notice. Since the DVD was one of the very first DVD's to be released when the universe of DVD owners was measured in thousands not millions, it has once again fallen below the radar.

Sound like fun to you? It's a rare action movie, one that basically takes place on one location (the train). But it's amazingly suspenseful, too, as railroad officials (who don't know of their stowaways) try to find ways to stop the unstoppable vehicle (shades of The Taking of Pelham One Two Three). Jon Voight plays Manny, the experienced jailbreaker, grizzled, ornery, obnoxious, but revered by his fellow prisoners. Eric Roberts plays Buck, the young, cocky, dimwitted tough guy who respects Manny and looks to him as the voice of reason.

Developed from an un-filmed Akira Kurosawa script by Djordje Milicevic, Paul Zindel, and former hardened inmate Eddie Bunker, Runaway Train proves that action movies can do a hell of a lot more than blow s**t up and offer amusing one-liners.Notorious convict Manny (Jon Voight) is released from three years in confinement by hateful warden Ranken (John P. Ryan) not just because of media pressure, but in the hope that he will try and escape so Barstow may kill him. After he is attacked and wounded, Manny makes the quick decision to escape his Alaskan confines, and does so with the help of the young and rather dumb Buck (Eric Roberts). They board a train, but unbeknown to them the engineer on board has died from a heart attack and the train is heading at high speed towards various obstacles. Ground-staff are alerted to the situation and quickly set about clearing the tracks, but Ranken has soon joined them with revenge in mind.Many Hollywood movies offer moments of spectacular visual effects and sound design that should be applauded, but normally these scenes don't tend to generate any excitement in me. Runaway Train offers similar scenes, but there's two key aspects that make the film work so well. The first is emotional investment. As despicable as these characters often are, Manny and Buck are real, helped considerably by the career-best performances of Voight and Roberts. The former, in an empowering speech that may just be the best work he's ever done, informs Buck of the futility of their situation. They may just rule the world if they could hold down a job, but they can't, they're criminals, and cannot escape their societal role.The appearance of Rebecca De Mornay's character Sara, a young engineer still aboard and who is unable to stop the train, highlights this. Manny and Buck squabble and fight for the first time in front of her, showing that when put into a situation where the laws of society come into play, they reject it and turn into animals. These exchanges occur between some nail-biting scenes, which brings me onto the next aspect that makes the film work so well - real action. There's no wide-shots of gigantic explosions, just two battered men clawing and slipping their way along the snow-drenched train. In one scene, after a daring attempt to jump carriages, Manny's wind and cold-battered face craws towards the camera, ragged bandages hang off his bloodied hand, and his crooked, brown teeth are bared. The camera is so intrusive that you really feel every move he makes, to the point where I felt exhausted.Though it does occasionally slip in prison movie cliché, this is perhaps one of the most underrated films ever made. It was recognised at the Oscars with nominations for Voight, Roberts and for Best Editing, but it doesn't seem to have left the legacy it certainly deserves. I wouldn't exactly call the film obscure, but your average film-goer probably won't have heard of it, especially when compared to, say, Die Hard (1988). This is riveting stuff, tightly directed by Russian Andrei Konchalovsky (who went on to make the crappy Tango & Cash (1989)), and the film leaves you with an beautiful and slightly eerie final image that could say more than words could have.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com "},{"Title":"Movement","Date":"17 February 2011","Score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":" Having seen Unstoppable, I had to see this.It is hard to know what influence Kurosawa had on this, but one can guess. He had been through his rejection in Japan, suicide attempt and film made and financed by the Soviets. He subsequently arranged scant funding for this, started and was foiled. What we have now is supposedly completely reworked. But what we see is Soviet iconography in the trains and snow, and Shakespearean motion toward tragedy. (Kurosawa would do the Shakespearean Ran instead of this, and we are lucky for that.)So this comment will not be on the acting, though Voight is not only superb, but inhabits the character as we fear we would. It is about the icons and the camera. I think we have inherited this from Akira.The trains have been painted to be big flat black hulks, reshaped with plywood to resemble Soviet machines. We have a Soviet director. Early in the film, we have that train (four locomotives) hit the end of another, demolishing it. In the process, the front of our beast is turned into a ragged tear of heavy metal, racing madly through heavy snow, angry at the weather.Unstoppable takes a few scenes from this the hitting of the end of another train; the bridge that has the fatal speed limit; the soldier lowered from a chopper then pummeled. But it is an altogether different film. Scott is all about energy in the camera. Every scene moves in a dance that is composed. The rhythm and energy is in our eye. He works to give is narrative stances for that eye TeeVee cameras, characters that are observers and others that comment on observation. The train is only a prop, the characters only something to carry the narrative thrust. The art is in the eye, on our side of the wall.This film has three animals Voight's character, a convict driven to heroic madness, the opposing warden who is every bit as demented and colorful. Both of these are runaway trains, bested by the train itself which has agency of its own. It seems to have killed and ejected the engineer, enticed two convicts aboard, then gone mad, attracting the warden as well. It is imprisoned in a braid of rails, designed here to relate to the train as the remarkable prison building is to the humans.All the cameras are static except the ones following the train, some of which race through the woods the same way we saw in Rashoman.It seems that like with Star Wars, Kurosawa can bless a film by merely breathing on it.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3 Worth watching.

In between and throughout it is also a philosophical character study and all these elements work together perfectly. I keep trying to think of reasons to give this a less than perfect score and can't think of one. This is film as art, for as entertaining and suspenseful as Runaway train is, it is metaphorically and visually a beautiful film and Jon Voight gives the performance of his career (was nominated for lead Oscar) as a brutal, savage multiple felon.Runaway train is directed by Russian Andrei Konchalovsky, based on a screenplay by Kurasawa (Seven Samurai) and takes place in Alaska, first in a high security prison, and later on the title train. Manny (Voight) is a long time con and multiple escapee who seems to like to play cat and mouse with the vindictive warden Rankin (John P. Ryan). As the film opens Manny is being released from a long stint in solitary after his latest escape attempt. Buck (Eric Roberts, nominated for supporting Oscar) is a young, slow-witted convict who idolizes Manny. Buck also is a boxer and works the laundry cart and Manny eventually is going to use Buck to assist in his latest escape.Buck talks Manny into taking him along and the two break out into the icy Alaskan wilderness. The two escapees nearly freeze to death before finally reaching a rail hub where they find some dry clothes and whiskey. They find something else too; they find a train that Manny picks that is about to pull out. The train is their ticket to freedom, or so thinks Manny, but shortly after pulling out the trains conductor is seen having a heart attack and falling off the train. Luke and Manny are initially unaware of this and are surprised as the train hurdles faster and faster across the frozen landscape.A stowaway is on the train (an almost unrecognizable Rebecca Demornay), and she has figured out what has happened and explains the situation to Luke and Manny. The two cons will attempt the dangerous climb to the front engine to shut the train down. Meanwhile, the local rail authorities also become aware of the dilemma and contemplate action...should they derail the train before it takes out an old bridge or an approaching factory? Also, Rankin has a helicopter in the air and is salivating at the thought of catching Manny again.The stage is set for some amazing stunt work as well as some captivating dialog between the three people on the train. I've read some reviews that view Demornays character as nothing but a plot device but I see it differently. Sara is an outsider to Manny and Buck initially, however as the tension builds she becomes the moral centerpiece of the film, while Manny is slowly deteriorating mentally and physically and Buck is suddenly in the middle. Its almost heartbreaking to watch the scene where Bucks illusions about Manny melt away as he gradually becomes aware of Manny's true nature. Again, the stunt work here is really something to behold and climaxes as Rankin is lowered by rope latter onto the catapulting locomotive for his final showdown with Manny. Now the two are face to face but this time Rankin has no guards and no bars to protect him.

The acting of both Jon Voight and Eric Roberts, especially, and Rebecca De Mornay is intense and superb.  Every camera shot heightens the drama.  Photographed in Alaska on the Alaska Railway, it's winter, the skies are leaden, the ground snow covered, the locomotives ice encrusted, and real snow falls on the train as it traverses the isolated countryside.  Action scenes of the train, both distant and close up, are truly remarkable.  (Train enthusiasts will not be disappointed!)    The only thing phony is the suggestion that the Alaska Railway is a more complex system than it likely is.  That quibble noted, everything else rings essentially true, and the filmmakers (thankfully) find no need to throw in a plethora of gratuitous complications, as occurs in so many lesser impending-disaster movies.  The story begins with two vicious antagonists in an Alaska prison. One, John Voight's character, convicted of violent crimes and prior escapes, has just won a court order for release from three years of being welded in his dark cell.  The thwarted warden, played by John P. Ryan, is equally vicious, with even less of a heart than Voight, who loses no time before escaping again.  Reluctantly, Voight takes along Roberts, as a younger, low-IQ, petty criminal with grandiose plans for his freedom.  Voight is advised to not let himself be brought back alive.Voight and Roberts make it to a railroad yard and into the last of the four locomotives.  In the first, the engineer starts the train, has a heart attack and stumbles off the train.  Voight realizes that the train is out of control when no horn sounds and after it hits a caboose that didn't clear the main track in time. Then DeMornay, having been napping forward, assesses the situation, and stumbles into the last unit for greater safety.  In this confined setting there are dramatic scenes between the two men and among all three.DeMornay, as a locomotive mechanic, advises that control resides only in the front unit and that because the number two unit is different (a streamliner), there is no passage to the front.  She has a way to curb the train's excessive speed, which narrowly averts one crash opportunity, but it is still out of control.  The control center can only shunt the runaway and other trains onto different tracks so as to postpone the inevitable crash and pick a location for least collateral destruction.Meanwhile, the warden, after demonstrating his viciousness at the railroad control center, boards a helicopter and effects a transfer onto the moving train, reuniting the two antagonists in a face-to-face final confrontation as the train races to its impending demise.The conclusion can't be happy, but it is nonetheless satisfying. --- Outstanding!!!

Nothing here is what it first appears.An action thriller which ascends to something far greater and succeeds beyond expectation is filled with memorable performances. Roberts has never been better than as Buck, a glib, flash and impressionable young convict, both in awe of Manny, yet equally resentful of the way the older man treats him. As for Voight . . . well, make up your own mind. Angelina Jolie may make the headlines these days, but her dad was one hell of an actor in his day.The scene where he counters Buck's grand plan of a trip to Las Vegas by urging the young man to find a job - any job - and work his way up to become president of the company is both moving and telling. It could have been rather worthy, yet it's anything but. Manny knows his own chances have gone; he is aware however there is a slim - albeit remote - chance for a young man like Buck to still make something of himself.I was reminded while watching this film how quickly time can pass. As the train of the title thunders along the tracks - an allegory for life itself? - we are left wondering if any of this group can survive.As the police close in and the hostility of the natural environment takes on a lethal grandeur, the battle of wills between Ranken (John P Ryan's memorably sadistic warder) and Manny turns from hunter and hunted to something approaching biblical proportions. The two men define each other. Ranken has to catch Manny to prove the system cannot be beaten, yet equally that very system from which Manny is running - prison - has turned him into the minor legend he is among his fellow cons.It is no surprise to learn that Akiro Kurusawa is the man behind the original story. Note too, the presence of Edward Bunker as a screenwriter. A one-time criminal who has turned life on its head and found redemption through a rare talent for the written word. Manny would be proud of him.RUNAWAY TRAIN is a film of rare power, which leaves its mark on your mind and your heart, all under the guise of an action thriller. Whoever would have thought it?

The original source material comes from a screenplay written by Akira Kurosawa (only one of the biggest geniuses in history), the director is the visionary Russian-born Andrey Konchalovskiy and finally the film neatly got re-processed and staffed with talented people from the USA. This unique action/cult hit benefices from an extremely fast pacing, an absorbing plot, marvelous picturesque Alaskan filming locations and a continuously high level of suspense. But there's more... Like many reviewers already righteously pointed out, Runaway Train really distinguishes itself from the vast majority of action movies thanks to its detailed and intelligent character drawings. All the characters, from our two male leads to the lesser important supportive players, incessantly develop and &#x96; depending on their role &#x96; gradually become more/less identifiable. The story opens in familiar territory, but nevertheless depicts the daily life inside the walls of a maximum security prison in a highly &#x96; I presume &#x96; accurate and authentic fashion. I've seen more than enough prison dramas/thrillers in my life thus far, and the riot sequences and illustrated atmosphere here are definitely some of the most intense ever. Manny, the most notorious inmate and personal nemesis of head warden Ranken, is released from his isolation cell after three years and promptly thinks up a plan to escape. Manny, along with the lesser intelligent but devoted lightweight boxer Buck, escapes via the sewer system and flees into the snowy landscape. The duo boards a four-engine cargo train, but remains unaware that the machinist had a heart-attack and that the train carries forth its journey uncontrolled and with a constantly increasing speed. Only when joined by an equally powerless female mechanic, they realize they are trapped and their whereabouts are exposed to the authorities. I can't emphasize enough that every sub plot as well as any supportive character is utmost compelling and carefully elaborated. There's the inescapable train ride, naturally, but also the gloomy interactions between the trapped convicts, the rivalry inside the railway control center and the personal vendetta of head warden to demolish Manny. Some (or even most) of the subject matter might be highly implausible, but it most certainly guarantees adrenalin-rushing entertainment. The dialogs are dazzling (like for example Manny's options-for-cons speech) and Alan Hume's cinematography is often downright breathtaking. Jon Voight and Eric Roberts deliver the best performances of their careers and deservedly received Oscar nominations, but there are plentiful of terrific names in the cast that also earn some praise, like the villainous John P. Ryan and Kenneth McMillan. Co-writer and jailhouse expert Eddie Bunker appears as Manny's mate and you will also definitely recognize Danny Trejo in his first credited role ever! By today, he's a respectable lead actor who appeared in hundreds of movies but &#x96; thanks to his friendly face and charming appearance &#x96; his first twenty movie roles or so were nameless inmate characters.

As an adventure story alone, it's A-1 as to pacing, setting, engaging viewer interest, and realism. At times, it's very hard to see how it could have been photographed.The three protagonists, two escaped convicts and a young female railroad employee, face challenge after challenge aboard a runaway train in the ice and snow of Alaska. Meanwhile, an obsessed warden pursues them and a frustrated bunch of railroad employees back at the control center attempt to stop the train before it either kills those aboard or smashes into other vulnerable sites and kills even more people.As the realization dawns on the three main characters (Jon Voight, Eric Roberts and Rebecca de Mornay) that they may all be killed, they begin to interact in a series of shifts, transformations and reflections that remind one of Rashomon, except that it's happening to them in real time, not as distorted memories. (Kurosawa wrote the earlier screenplay.) Deep questions of life and death, the realization of freedom, courage, triumph, and the nature of a human being all surface as these three individuals, each with a different outlook, are brought together in a life or death situation.When we first see Voight chained in his cell, his spirit is unbroken as he does pushups vigorously. On the wall are many scrawls, but one stands out near the black power clenched fist Triumph over all. Voight wants to triumph over the warden (John P. Ryan), even if he has to die doing it. The warden calls him an animal. De Mornay at one point does the same. Voight sees himself more clearly as worse -- a human. This theme is reinforced by the quote from Richard III at the end. Lady Anne says to Gloucester Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity. He replies But I know none, and therefore am no beast. His witty reply that catches her in contradiction is Voight saying he is no animal, but rather human. When de Mornay, the otherwise sensible and law-abiding person, during one conflict urges Roberts to kill Voight, she shows her ferocity as a human. She who called Voight animal becomes worse than animal briefly.But although this theme is stressed, it is human to act in contradictions as contexts alter. Voight may be willing to die, but not just yet if he can help it. He may be ready to kill Roberts, who is not his enemy, but he also recognizes the urge and, in a redemptive sense of self-insight and perhaps shame, can overcome it and attempt to surpass his human nature, even to fly five feet like a bird. With what aim? To be free. Although he becomes a ghost-like and Christ-like figure disappearing into the Alaskan mists, he is headed beyond this life, beyond winning and losing, beyond escaping prison, and beyond killing the warden. He is heading into a place where none of it makes a difference to him. His desire to die now that he is free and never be imprisoned again is stronger than his desire to live and be chained up like an animal and treated like one. He prefers to be human and die.

It's like Casablanca!","Date":"7 June 2011","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":" Wake up, whacko! is one of the funniest lines in Runaway Train. Since I use it to teach with, I have now seen Runaway Train probably two dozen times, and some scenes much more, as I replayed them for my own enjoyment or for thought. As you can guess, I'm a huge fan of the movie. In fact, it's my second favorite movie of all time. The first is Casablanca. I think the two have a lot in common. Manny in Runaway Train, and Rick in Casablanca, are protagonists who are cynical, self-interested, and ruthless. Each has been rendered callous partly by their choices in life, but also by the twists and turns that life has presented them. Each has been terribly scarred by a world which is uncaring, unfeeling, and unthinkingly oblivious to the sufferings of mere individuals. Each is imprisoned by circumstance and by their own pain. Both movies have huge streak of fatalism, existentialism, and determinism within them.Yet, Manny and Rick are far more widely admired by those around them than they first understand. Neither grasps that they are perceived as heroes by people who possess less stubbornness and independence. The people around them are kinder, gentler and, yes, weaker. Still, Manny and Rick have a surprising quality--they actually care much more about others than they will admit. Watch Rick in Casablanca and you'll see how vulnerable he truly is. You'll see how much peace, happiness, and love mean to him, and get some hints (the earlier Spanish Civil War, inability to return to America, and lost love) as to why those things are so poignantly painful for him to think about. Watch Manny (carefully) in Runaway Train and you'll see how how much he cares about his friend Jonah, and how hard he tries to do some good for Buck.And, Manny and Rick both face inner conflicts and painful moments of self-awareness followed by opportunities for courageous redemption. Although their choices have different consequences, once each has made his choice, he is immediately transformed into someone who is confident, at peace with himself, accepting of the price he has paid to do the right thing, happy he has truly done the work of a good man, and ready to face the future. In each movie, that transformational scene occurs at the end and is the highlight of the movie. We remember the climactic finale of each movie because those moments are the essence and message of each movie. The world hurtles onward regardless of us, but we do possess free will, the opportunity to make a difference, and the capacity to achieve inner freedom. In terms of production and editing, Runaway Train and Casablanca have further similarities. Both are sparsely shot. Each shot counts, and each has a purpose, much like each word of dialog. If you think there's something wasted in Runaway Train, watch it again and ask yourself why the director did it that way. These also are movies in which the dialogue and characters are everything. Every sentence and facial expression matters. The dialogue is sparing yet meaningful, and the characters' subtle mannerisms and expressions communicate far more than the words alone. I can watch either movie and still find something new to notice or to think about.So, there you have it. My two cents on why my two favorite movies of all time really are about the same things the indifference of the universe and the suffering it inflicts, balanced by yearning, courage, and love.

Together they escape prison and get aboard a train, capturing a hostage on the way, Sara (played by Rebecca de Mornay in also a good performance).Their escape should be a reason for joy, but instead becomes a nightmare when the train loses control and starts speeding to a collision that will kill the three people aboard. Plus, in this atmosphere of anxiety and fear, the relationship between the two convicts tenses as Manny reveals himself as a disagreeable, bullying bastard, shattering the image Buck had of his hero. Friendship turns to abuse and a power struggle.Runaway Train is a good blend of entertainment and character study. It's an exciting, suspenseful thriller that also explores the basest aspects of human existence, like Man's propensity for cruelty and aggression. Manny is portrayed almost as a force of nature, unstoppable in his quest for freedom and yet knowing that there is no place for a man like him in the world. There's almost something heroic in his figure, if he weren't a vicious convict and if the cinematography didn't portray most humans as insignificant ants amidst the giant, frozen landscapes of Alaska. Few movies have achieved such a balance between the arrogance Mankind has of its place in the world and of its real importance outside a non-human scale, like this movie does. The train speeding to a collision is hardly an event, amidst the snow falling that almost erases it from sight. And yet for Manny and Buck is a matter of life and death. What a wonderful irony.This is a very special movie, I had the pleasure of watching it a few years ago and I never completely forgot it, sometimes remembering it for Voight's or Roberts' performance, or for the shots of white landscapes, or for the sheer excitement of the narrative.

Warden Rankin is the man who has kept Manny locked up. These two men are destined to fight it out to the last breath. Manny escapes from prison with the help of Buck (Eric Roberts), a naive and ill-educated convict, and they cross the Alaskan wilderness, arriving at a train depot. There, they climb on a train and wait as it begins to move - only, the engineer dies and the two convicts are left on a train that is out of control and will inevitably meet disaster. Along the way, they meet another engineer on the train, Sara (Rebecca DeMornay), who almost acts as a spiritual guide to the two men, causing them both the reassess their lives in the final moments, leading to arguably the finest and most poignant endings of any film ever made. One must count on oneself. Nobody else - That's one of the most meaningful lines in this film (of many, many memorable quotes), and in many ways sums it up. Some might say that this is about the basic needs of a man. Some might say this is about freedom and the price a man must pay to truly get it. To me, this film is about the dance with death and the sheer loneliness that leads up to it. The battle that Manny faces with the world, the desolation of the prison, the emptiness of Alaska, the focus on money more than human life and the final climax show just how lonely and empty the world can be in the final moments of life. It's painfully clear from the start that this film will end in only one way for Manny. The only question that remains is how he will face it - will he face it head on as his character suggests, or will he fall at the final hurdle, rendering his life ultimately meaningless? I'll leave you to decide that. One thing I do know about this film - it is one you'll either take to or not. I think if you've ever been in a tight spot in life, or felt on your own, you'll instantly take to the character of Manny, and dare I say, even like him. You'll nod in understanding at every line he speaks, you'll applaud every action whether it's for better of for worse, you'll marvel in his unstoppable approach to his life. You'll do all this because you know that it has to be done for him to reach his destiny. I first saw this film when I was 5. It's stuck with me ever since, and even now remains one of my absolute favourites. I can overlook the few glaring errors in the plot, because the underlying story is so powerful. It shows life and death at their most raw, and it shows that ultimately you are alone with your decisions and your destiny. There are two scenes that prove this. The first is the exceptional monologue by Manny as he tries to convince Buck that life as a nobody is better than life as a criminal. The second is the ending, which is absolutely perfect and really says it all. It was hardly surprising to learn that Akira Kurosawa had written the original script - he was after all known for his character studies. And though it's not always perfect, it's perfect where it needs to be. Add to this the beautiful scenery and the realistic and exceptional action, and you have a film with real heart. Watch it, forgive the superficial errors and enjoy the character study of a man in his final moments and how he responds to it.

There is no good reason for any of this insanity, either in the plot (script) by Edward Bunker nor graphic direction by Andrei Konchalovsky. You have to rely upon their imagination and the wonderful cinematography - it is highly implausible that anyone has every lived-through this kind of brutality to tell about it. I hope. It is imminently important for the viewer to know that Manny (Jon Voight) has been welded in his cell for three years; that everyone looks up to him for his physical strength and wildness; that he only has nine months to go; a maniacal warden (John Ryan) wants him to screw-up so he can shoot him; that the entire prison is constantly in a riotous upheaval; and anyone who even THINKS they could successfully do any of this in 35-below-zero weather NEEDS to be welded into a cell, if they were lucky.We all are aware that humans cannot survive in below-freezing weather and water, yet Manny and Buck (Eric Roberts, in a fabulous performance) get naked in the bowels of the prison to smear themselves with some nasty stuff and wrap themselves in plastic sheeting, the theory to keep their body-heat in and the plastic from freezing to their skin. Guess what it works, although they tromp through the prison's sewers and then jump into an icy stream, Buck not even having shoes, gloves, a hat nor warm clothing, then trudges through miles of snow-storms to the railroad-terminal. So many improbabilities in these scenes it's mind-boggling no frozen clothes nor frost-bite? Anyway they get there, find some things they need and choose a train to get on, simply because Manny thinks it's looks like a monster. He's right. They become part of it, because there's no way to get off it but to jump in the snow. Although Manny is godlike to Buck, they become snarling animals. After a thorough beating by Manny, Buck says you were my friend....my hero....hmmmmmm......Sara (Rebecca deMornay) does instill a trifle of humanity in them......but barely.If that isn't enough of the story to get you hooked nor scare you away, watch the movie and then try to shake yourself out of the stupor you get into, and analyze the whole thing. It won't be easy. This is not sci-fi - these are all incidences that COULD happen. Some think this vicious role is Voight's best - good acting, but too crude. Robert's career should have vaulted from his performance; deMornay was great. All the supporting roles are stellar. The psychologies premises in this movie are devastating and make you say this is only a movie, like a bad dream. This is desperation and insanity at its highest intensity - I hope it stays light-years away from me. Another film I have to put on, then hide behind my computers to watch.

Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus were a pair of Israeli cousins who had financed various films in their homeland throughout the '60s and '70s before deciding to have a crack at the American market by purchasing a distribution and production outfit called the Cannon Group, Inc. Around 85% of Golan- Globus's Canon output was low-grade, trashy rubbish, more often than not badly made and badly acted. Every now and then, however, a Golan-Globus film would turn up that was a little better than the usual fare. Something slightly more artistically motivated and more high-brow in conception. Into this bracket would fall films like the Julie Andrews vehicle Duet For One, Jean Luc Godard's adaptation of King Lear, or the exciting existential thriller Runaway Train , directed by celebrated Russian film-maker Andrei Konchalovsky during his 'break-into-the- American-mainstream' phase. Runaway Train is notable for two remarkable leading performances from Jon Voight and Eric Roberts. Voight plays Manny Manheim, a notoriously violent bank robber serving a life sentence in a remote Alaskan maximum security prison. Manny is a legend amongst the other inmates, an almost animalistic criminal considered so dangerous that at one point the warden, Ranken (John P. Ryan), had his cell door welded for a period of three years. Once allowed back into general population, Manny plans an audacious escape aided by none-too-bright inmate Buck (Eric Roberts) whose position as a laundry room worker gives him access to a potential escape route. Against Manny's wishes, Buck decides to join in him in daring break for freedom. Unfortunately for them, they seek refuge aboard a train during their getaway only for the elderly engineer to suffer a heart attack at the controls. Through an accumulation of unforeseeable coincidences, the emergency break system on the train fails and the two escaped convicts find themselves aboard a runaway train, gathering momentum as it surges unmanned and out-of-control across the Alaskan wilderness. An inexperienced hostler, Sara (Rebecca De Mornay), is the only other person on board. Together the three of them fight against the power of technology (the train) and the power of nature (the harsh Alaskan conditions) as they try to regain control of the train.Violent, bloody, sharply characterised and frequently very exciting, Runaway Train may well be the jewel in the Golan-Globus crown. It's a tough film for sure &#x96; peopled mainly by ugly characters who do little more than snarl and threaten each other in abrasive, foul-mouthed exchanges &#x96; but it's never anything less than enthralling. The strength of characterisation is impressive. Voight's terrifying convict; Roberts' dumb but loyal opportunist escapee; De Mornay's vulnerable unwilling participant; Ryan's sadistically over-zealous warden &#x96; all fabulously written characters, played to the hilt by actors in top form. In one unforgettable scene, Voight attempts to uncouple the cars to stop the back section of the train &#x96; the couplings close over his hand, literally tearing off almost all his fingers in a shocking spray of pulpy gore. Still grinning maniacally, his hand a bloodied stump, Manny struggles back aboard and continues to terrorise his travelling companions. He's every bit as chillingly convincing as, say, Robert De Niro in the Cape Fear remake, a role that has striking similarities. The location is unusual and effective &#x96; the vast, freezing wilds of Alaska provide a perfect backdrop for the drama on-screen, enhanced further still by Trevor Jones's atmospheric score. The film's unrelentingly ugly tone and a strangely pretentious ending are minor quibbles, but overall Runaway Train is a thunderingly good film.

RUNAWAY TRAIN manages to be both of those things, and the Akira Kurosawa (upon whose screenplay the film is based) credit at the opening is the first clue that this is going to be quite unlike the rest of the Cannon Group's fare during the 1980s. On the face of it, RUNAWAY TRAIN looks like a superficial thriller it starts off with a prison break and then moves to the out-of-control speeding locomotive stuff, throwing in plenty of suspense and stunts along the way. But it's something far more besides.The best action films work because of the characters involved. DIE HARD wouldn't be so well remembered today if it wasn't for Bruce Willis's wisecracking cop, and imagine PREDATOR or COMMANDO without Schwarzenegger's larger-than-life presence. RUNAWAY TRAIN is a very good film, and the reason for that is in the well drawn characters, in particular Jon Voight's long-term con. Voight plays a scarred, hulking prisoner who's been welded into his cell for the past three years, and he understandably goes a bit crazy when he discovers himself a free man. Usually, we're used to seeing Voight as a serious and subdued character (as in DELIVERANCE) which makes his performance here as a borderline-insane brute of a man all the more shocking and surprising. During his various monologues I realised I was watching a performance of greatness.Eric Roberts is a bit harder to stomach, playing a slow-witted character who's there as a foil for Voight. His mannered performance may be off-putting to some, but in the end I give him the thumbs up thanks to his fresh-faced innocence. Rebecca De Mornay, in her breakout role, is a breath of fresh air and adds immeasurably to the experience.Let's face it much of what happens in this film is clichéd. The early prison scenes, while mean, vicious and violent, are overly familiar. The train-bound shenanigans are also familiar &#x96; and I groaned when they threw in the old 'weak bridge' cliché once again. Late scenes involving the crazed warden (a deliciously nasty John P. Ryan) are pretty ludicrous. Nonetheless, RUNAWAY TRAIN makes up for these shortcomings with well drawn, realistic characters, superb meditations on the nature of man and one of the best, most chilling endings I've ever seen in a film, a literally hair-rising shot that will stay with me for a long time to come.

Voight and Roberts are both very over-the-top, but it fits well with the movie so I really liked both performances. I also liked John P.

Several of the best films of the 80s come from that year alone (THE BREAKFAST CLUB, BACK TO THE FUTURE, THE FALCON AND THE SNOWMAN), then there's this film, RUNAWAY TRAIN, a movie that I've always admired and loved. By turns exciting and poetic, RUNAWAY TRAIN is an explosively told tale of Oscar Manny Manheim (Best Actor nominee Jon Voight) and Buck Rogan (Best Supporting Actor nominee Eric Roberts), 2 escaped prisoners from the icy Alaskan prison.Voight and Roberts pretty much run away with this movie as these 2 actors play perfectly off each other, believably coming across as rugged hardened criminals the older, savvy, world-weary Manny and the young, green, excitable Buck. The film wastes no time in getting straight to the action as the protagonists escape within the first 15 or 20 minutes, then board the runaway train.Russian director Andrei Konchalovsky does an amazing job of keeping the film interesting as it shifts between Manny and Buck on the train and the railroad office trying to stop it before it's too late. The plot moves along at a solid pace. The location shooting is fantastic as the snow-covered land and mountains forms a great backdrop for the seeming desolate hopelessness of the situation.Excellent support is given by John P. Ryan as the evil warden Ranken hot on the 2 men's trail, Kyle T. Heffner as train engineer Barstow trying to stop the train before innocent lives are lost, and Kenneth MacMillan as a rail boss trying to work the situation from a damage control angle to keep the company from looking bad for letting one of it's train go runaway. Rebecca DeMornay is probably the weakest link as Sara, but she's not as bad as advertised and does a good with what little she's given to do.Again, Voight and Roberts are just plain magnificent in their roles and I dare say they are the ones that should have taken home the Oscars that year for this film (not whoever actually won!). Action-packed, emotionally powerful, raw and poetic, RUNAWAY TRAIN is an all-time classic!

The plot takes the characters from the trap of prison to the trap of a train which can't be stopped inside of an environment which would kill them even if they could escape. This creates an early level of isolation and despair used to great dramatic effect by the director and the talented actors.We get an epic battle between an alpha male career criminal, and an alpha male police officer that has to be one of the greatest personal battles put on film. We also witness the relationship between Voigt's fearfully strong Manny and Roberts' brilliantly-played mentally 'challenged' character Buck. This serves as a vehicle to explore issues surrounding relationships between the strong and the weak, in contrast to the battle between Voigt and Ryan, a battle between two titans. These set-ups are not wasted. The dialogue is real, inciteful and moving. Late in the movie, the strong Manny is maimed by the train itself, a message to would-be rebels that they will suffer in unexpected ways for fighting order, or maybe just a reminder from the fifth major character - the train, that it, playing fate without a soul, is really in charge.Voigt's victory (with a steep price) at the end might not sit well with law enforcement, but it sits well with anyone who wants to challenge the status quo or perceived oppression.DeMornay's character is a stand-in for the average moviegoer, an innocent caught up by fate in the melee.Despite all this acting brilliance, and gripping action, for me, one of the most compelling, memorable things in this movie is the spectacle of the train itself blasting through miles of bleak environment with increasing amounts of snow and wind. The train keeps hurtling powerfully through it all, but headed only to oblivion. Somewhere in there, there is a metaphor for the human condition - our power to cut through the world, but to what end exactly? Phenomenal movie.

It's about two convicts- Jon Voight (unusually great in a bad-ass role of a lifetime) and Eric Roberts (also unusually great, though not at all subtle, as a dim-wit who follows along for the ride)- who hop onto a train after making an escape from an Alaskan prison. As fate would have it (or just plain dumb bad luck), the conductor has a heart-attack, drops dead, and falls out of the train after he starts it to maximum speed. The convicts can't stop it, and neither can napping-and-awoken Sara (Rebecca DeMorney, not bad though not great as a 'third wheel' and voice of reason for the audience), nor can the control team at HQ. Meanwhile, the prison warden (played as a total hard-ass whom I can't remember) is also on their tracks to take em back to jail to resolve a possible riot.Luckily, despite all the appearances, the writers (including an ex-convict, also a player in the movie, Eddie Mr. Blue Bunker) stay true to what must be a certain spirit in Kurosawa's text. Through all of the chills and thrills, and the constant weight of circumstance and the (perhaps obvious) existential turmoil aboard the train- particularly in the final reel- there's humanism to the piece. As Sara screams to Manny during a fight between him and the other convict, You're an animal! No, no, human! Human! And through the meaty performances, and the weight in the text, Konchalovsky has such a great hand at the helm that it doesn't compromise the original author. He's made a movie that works so well for the time that it's obvious descendant, Speed, seems somewhat paler in comparison. He almost makes the train itself another character, or part of the metaphor of the disaster that's headed for them without the willpower to stop it. Only one liability- a heavy-handed synth-score from Trevor Jones- keeps it from being a truly great thriller.So strap in with some cool characters (Manny truly is the closest Voight got to play a really juicy villain, with Buck allowing Roberts to get a little depth to an otherwise spotty choice of roles), and action that has likely none of today's comforts (i.e. CGI), with a thought provoking roller-coaster (yeah, went there with that description) that hasn't dated too much since its 1985 release. 9.5/10 "},{"Title":"Runaway Movie - this is the real thing!","Date":"12 February 2001","Score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":"  I got to see this movie for the third time on broadcast TV the other night. Even interrupted with commercial breaks, with language bleeped out, with snowy reception, and on a 19 screen, this movie has a power and a vision I have almost never seen elsewhere. Don't rent it if you're looking for a comfortable, conventional, predictable, or optimistic view of life; this movie is like a force of nature and you will never forget it.When I first saw this, both I and my date noticed how the movie's structure is like the train itself; it starts off very slowly and gradually, and slowly, inexorably builds speed and tension all the way to the end. The beginning sequences, set in Hell, set up the central question of the film Is Manny more than an animal? By the end, we know that, as grotesque and brutal as he is, he has achieved a kind of redemption. By exerting himself to save Buck and Sara, and by annihilating the evil warden, he has changed himself from whatever he was when he came out of the cell into a visionary figure. He is unforgettable, even though you hate him.In the sixteen years since this picture was made, lots of advances have been made in special effects. There's the photographic glories of The Matrix, the enormous powere of Titanic, the animation feats of the Disney and DreamWorks studios. But I defy anyone to duplicate the incredible tension of some of the scenes of this film, such as the hanging-from-a-ladder-above-the-train scene, or the falling down between the cars scene (where Manny gets his finger(s) cut off). On top of that is the long scene where Manny keeps Buck out of the train car, followed by the fight scene that even makes Sara into a feral animal. These are absolute tours de force; and I can't begin to imagine what hell this movie was to make. But it's a real masterpiece - if you want to see a movie that will leave you tingling, this is it.

Jon Voight plays a convict who was, is and will always be a dysfunctional outsider, and he knows it. His ramshackle, crazy eyed stare and blood stirring, despair laden rants about his place in the world, or lack thereof, are spectacular. He orchestrates a white knuckle escape from the remote Alaskan prison he's been dumped in, with a young, bright eyed convict in tow (Eric Roberts). This is a landmark performance in Robert's staggering body of work. He plays Buck with a sunshiny, sweet disposition and makes him a genuinely likable puppy dog who lives moment to moment, free of the burden of consequence. Until Voight's jaded, brutally paternal influence sears his soul and spurs his loss of innocence. They're a wicked duo for this type of film, facing every challenge with equal parts reckless abandon and world weariness. As soon as the freight train they jump rails out of control, the film picks up speed for some truly breathless set pieces and stunt work that will leave you gasping. Rebecca De Mornay plays a tough railroad worker. Underrated character John P. Ryan plays the hell out of his prison warden role, wallowing in sickening self righteous malice and bullying sleaze. The heart of the film resides in a monologue that Voight shares with Roberts, about finding ones legitimate place in society and growing up. Roberts simple, childlike response visibly breaks Voight's heart as he realizes his tragic hypocrisy and unchangeable ways. It's a dynamite, time capsule moment that alone is worth a re watch. The pulpy nature of the films plot is steered into a profundity by the excellent introspective script, and the fact that the actors throw themselves headlong into their work, and nail every moment.

As an American film directed by a Russian director Andrei Konchalovsky with a principal cast of American actors, it was shot in Canada based on a screenplay written by Akira Kurosawa, a renowned Japanese cinema author. Escape films can make their own specialized genre but for Runaway Train there is no ordinary escape in sight. Director Konchalovsky depicts the primacy of mind over body. The major highlight of this film is the manner in which many 'spectacular action' scenes have been shot. They give viewers an idea about the suffering experienced by prisoners in a high security American gaol. These scenes are so authentically genuine that they have all the strength to put contemporary CG films to shame. A sense of claustrophobia is developed when this film's three protagonists are left to fend for themselves on a train without a director.

The acting is top notch, with Jon Voight in one of the most interesting roles of his career. Andrei Konchalovsky directs with style and intelligence, making the train in this story a character in its own right and using the time spent on it as a period of reflection and self-examination. Certainly Runaway Train is an extremely prestigious production for Menahem Golan, Yoram Globus, and the Cannon Group, which for the most part was cranking out pure entertainment during the 1980s.Voight plays Oscar Manny Manheim, hardened veteran convict who breaks out of an isolated maximum security prison located in Alaska. His tag along is an annoying young chatterbox, Buck McGeehy (Eric Roberts) who idolizes Manny, as do many of the other prisoners. They hop a train only for the engineer to have a heart attack and fall off, leaving the train barrelling nonstop through the Alaskan countryside. Tailing them is associate warden Ranken (the great, under-rated character actor John P.

The film is unrelentingly tense and gripping every step of the way, running an hour and 52 minutes but very much flying along, just like its title vehicle. It's based on an unused screenplay by the legendary Akira Kurosawa, which got adapted for American audiences by author / playwright Paul Zindel and Djordje Milicevic and then polished by ex-con turned author, screenwriter, and actor Edward Bunker (who appears in the film as Jonah). Voight is a force of nature as the intimidating Manny, and he and Roberts do play off each other very well. Rebecca De Mornay, severely deglamorized here, adds another touch of humanity playing a railroad employee who shares their precarious situation. Ryan is lots of fun as the antagonist, and offering additional solid support are Kyle T. Heffner (Flashdance), T.K. Carter (The Thing), and Kenneth McMillan (Dune). And recognize that boxer and prison guard? They're played by Danny Trejo and Tommy 'Tiny' Lister, then relative newcomers to film.This one truly deserves peoples' attention. It's too good to pass up.

He is joined by a naive follower (Eric Roberts). They stow away on a train consisting of four locomotives whose engineer has a heart attack and the train runs away. Meanwhile, the arrogant warden (John P. Ryan) is on the warpath for Manny.Runaway Train is such a powerful experience because it's much more than just a mindless action flick, as the title would suggest; the thrilling events are actually a stage for a fascinating study of the human condition. Manny is a hardened convict who's at war with the world and everyone in it. When called an animal he replies, No, worse -- human! This is a man who wants one thing, freedom, but he knows that he's too far gone to make it in conventional society. He shares a parable with his dumb partner, made up on the spot, about having a menial job and submitting to the boss even though you might want to rip his throat out. This is the key to making it in society -- submitting to authority and resisting the rage within; and then getting your check on payday and enjoying the fruits thereof. Manny wishes he could do this, but knows he can't. So what hope is there for him in modern society? If he can't do that then why's he escaping prison? In other words, Manny knows there's no hope for him, even if his escape is successful. To him, freedom can only come one way. I don't believe this, but I understand why he believes it.There's another potent scene where Manny has a knife and mercilessly comes against his own partner. You see the rage on his face, like a cornered animal. After intense emotions are vented Manny suddenly realizes... and then he just bows over, completely spent. A character, who should be afraid of him, somehow understands and compassionately reaches out in a semi-embrace.Powerful scenes like these are combined with surreal images of the misshapen locomotives barreling down the tracks in the freezing wilderness accompanied by the ominous score by Trevor Jones. Some parts of the score scream mid-80s, but other parts -- like the aforementioned -- are timeless.Rebecca De Mornay has an atypical role as a railroad worker who stumbles on to the convicts. She intuitively sees through their macho posturing. Although she knows they're desperate & dangerous, she also sees that they're not wholly evil. Roberts is basically a kid at heart and Manny is just blinded by the incredible rage within. He's only irredeemable because of his stupid pride, built up over years of hardened confinement.Voight is near unrecognizable as Manny and Roberts is just superb as his dumb sidekick. These two along with De Mornay are examples of acting at its finest.John P. Ryan is very effective as the machismo warden Ranken, but his Captain Ahab-like role comes off too comic booky to be plausible. Yet Ranken shows that you can be an animal on the outside of prison just as much as on the inside. Both Manny and Ranken are corrupted by pride, but Manny at least knows it. And he's not too far gone to recognize those who are worthy of life and to respond accordingly.The film was shot in Montana and Alaska and runs 111 minutes.GRADE A+ "}{"Title":"Great Performances","Date":"10 October 2010","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama","Review":" Sometimes you like a movie for the plot, or the cinematography, or the theme.

He lives up to his reputation. Ryan is eminently detestable. And DeMornay finds herself in a unique role where she is cast for her vulnerability (and acting ability) instead of her looks. This film works just as well now as it did as when it was made. The final scene between Voight and Ryan, when they demonstrate that there is little difference between them is classic.

As the train charges on to its destination, the tension rises as the people on board fall into arguments trying to stop the train before it's too late.The footage of the powerful 3-train locomotives is tastefully done and the sounds will make most heavy machine and train nuts salivate.It has some long periods of talking and a brilliant subtle electronic soundtrack.

It sounded interesting enough and watched it and I am so glad I did!! For a very unknown film both Voight and Roberts get Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for their roles which are more than well deserved. They took what is probably a 7/10 film into a full 9/10 and blew it away. But more on them later. The film starts in a prison, you get a full scale nail biting prison escape into Alaskan tundra and onto a train which is suddenly on the verge of disaster which it is unmanned and flying towards destruction. The film has you on the edge of your seat for every minute as you see man vs man, man vs nature and man vs himself at every turn. The film doesn't stay within one setting but jumps through what most films strive to do in three different movies. Violent, gritty, disturbing, and absolutely brilliantly acted. If you want to see something that isn't a blockbuster but probably should have been and will completely entertain you from beginning to end and even if you aren't a fan of Voight or Roberts their performances are jaw dropping.Jon Voight is an acting legend and I've always felt I've never really seen where his legendary status comes from. I'm sure that this isn't what people have in mind but I am now convinced. His absolutely violent and brilliant portrayal of safe cracker and dangerous criminal Manny is mind blowing. Truly brilliant in every way. I might place Manny into a top ten list of the best cinematic characters in history for me. Eric Roberts I have always known as the B-Movie actor who has been around forever. I know now that I have seen him at his absolutely very best. His performance as Manny follower Buck is equally as stunning as Voight. Buck is dim witted, passionate and hyper and the connection he has with Voight's Manny is disturbing and twisted. The chemistry between them is just palpable. If you don't see this for any other reason see it for them! A very young Rebecca De Mornay plays Sara, the young train rider who ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time and becomes something of a romantic interest for Buck. De Mornay does a decent job but unfortunately her character is unnecessary and awkwardly tossed into the story. There is no reason for her to be there and I think they added her strictly to have a female presence. It does however give rise to Buck going against Manny. Supporting cast are all decent but don't particularly stand out especially against the leading cast.In reading about Runaway Train it seems as though it went through a lot of changes and attempted castings before finally getting off the ground. Jeff Bridges, Henry Fonda, Tom Berenger, Karen Allen and Peter Falk were all tied to the project. Russian director Andrey Konchalovskiy must be given props for his brilliant use of the cold tundra setting and the fast paced action and giving Voight and Roberts the room to really devour these characters. It isn't very often that in a action flick characters can really get depth like this. Konchalovskiy proved he has this talent again in the eighties classic Tango and Cash. The film has some really violent scenes and some truly great moments of action and intensity. The one fault to the film is the ending which leaves things a little unsatisfactory when they spend the entire film on such an incredible build up to have a rather lack luster ending.

There were so few ambitious films made during this time that films like Runaway Train seem almost like The Godfather in comparison to the endless parade of Police Academy and Friday the 13th sequels. Don't get The Hound wrong. Some of those films are wonderful entertainment if you're in the right mood, but a veteran film buff sometimes needs a little more bang for his buck. Thank goodness for films like Runaway Train.The story deals with two hard-nosed Alaska prison escapees who jump on a small, but powerful string of about four engines and a caboose. The engineer conveniently has a heart attack and falls off the train but it keeps on going, quickly getting out of control. Also there is a female railroad worker (DeMornay) stowed away on board, but she's pretty much just along for the ride, herself. In pursuit is the prison warden (Ryan), and he'd love to get his hands on the two prisoners before the state police do. Attempts are made by a group of hapless office people to use their computers to divert the train out of harm's way, but they don't amount to much. Nobody seems to have any clue how to stop it, and the race is on to see if any of the three can be rescued before the train jumps the dead-end track it has been sent to.Jon Voight is pretty convincing and Manny. He has escaped numerous times before, and has been welded into his cell by the warden. At the film's outset, Manny wins a lawsuit and is removed from this cell. He has had a long time to think while confined like that. He isn't even out more than a day when another prisoner tries to kill him. Manny knows he HAS to escape again, or he will certainly be killed. The warden will see to that. Within a matter of days, he and Buck (Eric Roberts) are trudging through the prison sewer system and then out into the frozen tundra. After a while, they've hopped the train, but this is hardly the ticket to freedom they were hoping for. Roberts is his typical creepy self that he seemed to keep playing when he was younger. His personality actually serves the character quite well. DeMornay is pretty good too. It's basically one of those kinds of roles Charlize Theron plays these days. A pretty actress trying to play someone unattractive.The action is outstandingly well staged. The violence and gore will stick with you. This is a film about UGLY people, and no punches are pulled when bodily damage is done to any of the characters. The scenery is gritty and you can just FEEL how cold these people must be. Snow flurries whip past the desperate characters as they cling to frozen rail cars under slate-gray skies. The film's only major flaw is the way the characters back at the railroad headquarters behave. These people act like the Keystone Cops in their attempts to bring the train under control, and the light-hearted manner with which their characters are written is out of place in this film. The conclusion is haunting. It will stick with you, and that's all I'll say. The film is easily worth 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.

I also remember bits and pieces of it from late night cable. With all this exposure, one would think I would actually get to see the movie in it's entirety. Initially, I didn't expect so much passion and depth from this movie. It also seems like this might be an homage or definitely inspired by Jules Dassin's Brute Force.The movie revolves around a lifer inmate (John Voight) at an Alcatrez-like prison in the wilderness of Alaska, run by an sob warden (crazy-eyed John P. Ryan). The warden had Manny (Voight) in a solitary cell, a cell that was welded shut, for three years. The warden is forced to release him after Manny wins his litigation in this matter. Everyone knows, the warden included, as to what Manny is going to do next. Escape or Die Trying !! The escape leads to a train yard and then to a train. Did I mention it takes place during an Alaskan winter ?This movie has it all. It first starts out as a prison movie. It is very gritty and graphic. It then turns into a escape/heist picture, complete with sidekick (Julia Robert's brother). After the conductor falls off the train, it turns into the Towering Inferno disaster movie on a train. Through all this it is still an action movie. On top of all this, it layered with Shakespearean undertones mixed with Nietschian frosting. John Voight's performance as Manny is simply amazing. I would definitely characterize it as one of his best. Manny is the grit and the experience. He is juxtaposed by the relative innocence and idealism of his sidekick, Buck (Eric Roberts). The warden is the other major player. He acts as the pursuer and yet admires and fears Manny. They are more alike than each gives the other credit for. The train becomes a small stage (or maybe a petri dish) for the human race to play it's game out on.The finale is filled with everything a heroic epic needs. There is sacrifice, glory, determination, perseverance, freedom and a little bit of sadness. We don't actually see the finale. We just fade to gray and white. I don't think anyone could have done it better. I highly recommend this movie for fans of true cinema.

Actually they've produced a couple of films I really did like and this is one of them. The storyline is good but the script is a little weak at times and an overall implausibility that runs through the entire film. Too many writers contributed to this that it tends to go off in different directions at times and it's a second generation Americanized version of the original story. This is based on a story that was written by Japanese writers Ryuzo Kikushima and Hideo Oguni and drafted into a screen play by noted Japanese director/writer Akira Kurosawa but was never made into a film and collected dust for 15 years. Former juvenile delinquent turned career criminal and longtime prison inmate Eddie Bunker who had the fortune of turning his life around and becoming a best selling crime novelist reworked the screenplay of Kurosawa. Playwright/screenwriter Paul Zindel and scriptwriter Djordeje Milicevic added to the final draft and Soviet director Andrei Konchalovsky took it to film. Despite it flaws it is one of the rare character-driven action films and its direction is enhanced by veteran British cinematographer Alan Hume who has a long resume of films include three James Bond pictures and the acclaimed comedy A Fish Called Wanda. Jon Voight and Eric Roberts star as Manny and Buck, two escaped convicts from a maximum security Alaskan prison who hop a train in their quest for freedom but the engineer drops dead of a heart attack and the only other person around is an maintenance engineer named Sara played by Rebecca Demornay who is inept at solving the problem of a brake less locomotive racing through the Alaskan landscape at 90 mph. Nobody along the railroad line can figure out how to stop it and can only reroute other trains to avoid a head on collision. To add to the dilemma the sadistic prison Warden Ranken, played by John Ryan is tracking them in a helicopter with a shoot to kill vengeance. It is a nicely stylized film and the locomotive is the menacing star of the film as it tears across the frozen countryside. It's a thriller for which Voight and Roberts each received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. Voight's third nomination didn't win him an Oscar but he did get the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a drama. Henry Richardson also received an Oscar nomination for his film editing. I would give this a 7.5 out of 10.

On the face of it we have two hardened criminals from an even harder prison who escape with their pursuers hoping to capture them dead rather than alive, but for those looking for this will only find disappointment.Although the original script was changed, it has to be said that the changes that were made were for the better. I am of course referring to the the start of the movie being written back to include the few days in prison preceding the escape and up until they board the train. This added to the character interaction between Manny and Rencken. Manny is the depraved ruthless criminal and Rencken is the equally ruthless warden who believes in what is doing - that is to rid the world of people like Manny by right or wrong methods. To Rencken these men had given up their rights when they had stepped outside the law and he is righteously empowered to deal with them. This is a recurring theme in movies, the most notable one being 'Unforgiven'. Manny is a hero to the other prisoners since he takes a stand against their unjust captors. It also shows that the world is not black and white and Manny and Rencken are evidence of this since sometimes our protectors - Rencken - are criminals who need an excuse, and the criminals - Manny - can become societies unlikely heroes by standing up to people like this.   Manny is caged like the animal Rencken believes he is, but he wins his appeal and the scene is set for a climatic encounter between the two of them.Buck, the willing assistant to Manny, escapes with Manny and they have to face the harsh environment that is Alaska. This is a almost perfect setting for such men since it sets against each other the hardest men humans have to offer against the harshest weather nature has.The introduction of the train is fantastic. A great monolith that reveals itself from out of the shadows and it looks like a monster that man cannot conquer, even through the use of technology as the rail operators were to find out. Throughout the movie it lumbers on seemingly sweeping all before it and ultimately determining the fate of the bitter rivals. The only problem I have with it's introduction is the use of typical 80's action music when the two make their way towards it. But fortunately it does not undermine all what I have outlined above.On the train the differences between the two come to the fore. Manny is man of many hard experiences and has obviously acquired some wisdom from them and thus has no patience with his naive partner whose small times ways is accentuated by the fact that he is in jail for what Manny believes is small time offences. Buck is thus going to have to learn or suffer the consequences - even if it means his end. This is in direct contradiction to his stand against Rencken and it is in the end that Manny learns by letting Buck live as he takes his enemy to the death with him.When Sara finds the two stowaways, we see a woman who has adapted to the harsh conditions of working in Alaska and is therefore not intimidated by them. Although pretty, she is unglamorous, thus mirroring the environment they are set against.The climax was not altogether predictable, although the beginning of the movie made it clear that the enemies final encounter would result in loss of life, it was not clear that both were going to meet a dire end. This is without doubt a fitting conclusion. Manny achieves freedom by killing the man who would have forever hounded him and frees his friend, Jonah, from Rencken's rule. He also achieves true hero status by becoming a martyr. Only Jonah completely understands this and is pleased for his friends freedom. Manny lets Buck and Sara go because this is only between him and Rencken and he gets up on the train and welcomes death - his freedom - with open arms. He knew that this was the only way he was going to achieve victory.The actor's performances - Jon Voight and Eric Roberts - are phenomenal and it is no surprise that they were oscar nominated. Although Eric Robert's mannerisms may annoy at times this was necessary to create a suitable character that Manny would have numerous flare - ups with. Andrei Konchalovsky creates a sublime prison drama and although it will need to go somewhat further before being an intellectual showcase, it certainly makes you think long afterwards.

Most of the dialogue of this film gives that impression to most of the characters and I think that's a reflection on the writers.

Like those films, it appeals to my base nature but also does so in a way that is notable for its quality. Since this film was made in the eighties, a long time ago for some but not for me, it is also worth mentioning that it was made at a time when there was a paucity of this kind of film. If you ask me, there still is.For anyone who's more interested in the tenacity of Tuco the bandit in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly than they are in watching how many cars or buildings a studio will pay to blow up, this movie is for you. What I mean is, the toughness of the characters is more important here than the mayhem itself, though there are a couple of great scenes of trains crashing into things. Jon Voigt is effing amazing here as Manny, the ubermensch of the prison he escapes from, which brings me to Nietzsche, which brings me to philosophy, which there is some of in this movie. That doesn't mean that rich art snobs will discuss it over wine and cheese, but I don't understand why anyone cares if they should. I'm much more interested in John P. Ryan as the warden flushing the punk college boy's head in the toilet.That being said, there is a mirror image relationship here between Voigt's character, who has accepted himself as an animal and become the best animal he can be, and Ryan as the prison warden, who is every bit as much an animal but pretends to be so for moral reasons. Voigt's character is honest. Ryan's is not--in fact he is more sadistic and mean spirited as a result of his suppressed sadism--and therein lies much of the philosophy. My kind of message. In fact, it goes even deeper through the implied redemption of Eric Roberts' character; he plays the young, not very smart convict who starts out idolizing Voigt. Through his characters' possible hope, and Voigt's final semi-noble act, we see that humans can be better than animals if they choose to.The classic speech about getting a low-wage job and cleaning that little spot for your weaselly little manager is gold to anybody whose ever had to take a fast food job at a later age than most and get bossed around by twenty-year-olds.Though I downplayed the action aspects earlier, it has plenty of that, too. And the arctic setting, and the giant-sounding music...the terrain, the characters, everything about this movie is tough. And it has no illusions about its characters' motivations. And it works on many levels. And Eddie Bunker, the great ex-con novelist, lent authenticity to the prison aspects through his work on the screenplay and small role in the beginning. And Eric Roberts has never been this good (I knew a guy with the exact mannerisms of his character, and ain't nuttin' wrong wit duh aksents), and John Voigt only was one other time (can you say, Joe Buck?). And Ryan, who I only really know from Millius' Dillinger, in which he dies way too soon, is the perfect villain.For guys who like movies a la the TNT network thing but also can't tolerate drivel.

This ending was the most fitting one. There could not be anything better than this. The realization comes from isolation in the compartment of runaway train. It is an amazing character study. The three human beings are forced to look deep into the abyss of human nature in the most trying situation, being pushed to the brink of life and death.

What separates this movie from Cannon's other forgettable films is the character development. They are fully realized and you come to care about what happens to them and even root for them. Don't get me wrong this is no Die Hard or Lethal Weapon but if you have an hour and a half with nothing to do this movie will fill that time nicely.

We begin at a prison that's about as grim as Shawshank. The regime is vicious, its governor hardly better than the inmates. We spend quite some time overseeing how a breakout is gradually set-up.It's not a good time to be outside. The prison lies in the wintry fastness of Alaska. It's freezing cold and there's thick snow and ice. 'Manny' played by Jon Voight is the 'daddy'. He's the arch villain who you never cross. And he's going out. Eric Roberts plays 'Buck'. He's a punk with a hero-worship complex. He's also a nagging, repetitive pain-in-the arse, but also completely plausible. The breakout is a success. The punk - who only has a comparatively short sentence for statutory rape on account of underage-sex with his girlfriend - foolishly goes out with him. They trudge through the vile wilderness until they actually find a railway stock-yard. There are trains moving around. And there's a chance to get more clothing and shelter. Manny picks a train to ride, unbeknown that its driver is ill. During a stroke he applies both throttle and brake before falling off - dead. It's a rather improbable coincidence, but you have to let it pass. The brakes burn out and the stage is now set for a runaway train.It transpires that the driver's grand-daughter is on board. Played by Rebecca DeMornay. Now she really is a pain in the butt. It's clear that she is only there to provide clues about the functioning of the train and as a sexual foil for the younger man. The chemistry is crass, clichéd and doesn't work.Eventually, after a spectacular collision, it dawns on all that there's no driver and something must be done. The train is actually 3 motor units but they are of differing types, and getting from theirs (at the back) to the unit at the front entails a number of dangerous, icy gaps. In the meantime, the prison warden is hot on their tail in a homicidal rage and a helicopter. There's a showdown.The speeding train in the genuinely icy scenery cuts a demonic and at the same time melancholy image. It's dark, powerful and massive, the unstoppable force; but it's doomed. Like a Tyrannosaurus on the cusp of extinction. The scenery is frozen, stark and bleakly wonderful. Railway fans will love it. But the endless bickering between the convicts is often crass and tiresome, though entirely believable for all that. They're criminal scum not educated engineers. There are no nice people. There is no humour to lighten the moment. The characters are very much like the landscape they're flying through. The plot is dead simple, the ending more-or-less inevitable. I don't know how it could be improved. A smarter script would compromise its viciously authentic stamp. Perhaps if there'd been a third convict with a bookish mentality to add a little cerebral content - I don't know. Shawshank only worked because its protagonists could see beyond their hideous circumstances. It's worth watching at least once, if only for the railways and their landscape. But the script and the relentless nihilism of the lead characters for whom - unlike Shawshank - there is no redemption, soon begin to jar with a second viewing.

It's part action thriller, part art-house discourse on the evils of men. And despite the relatively sparse storyline, it manages to grab your attention from the outset and hold it for the duration of the film.Jon Voight puts in a mesmerising performance which deservedly won him a Golden Globe (and an Oscar nomination), although at times his portrayal of the convict Manny could be viewed as possibly one of the most over-the-top in cinematic history! He probably even beats Al Pacino's Scarface role in this respect! Eric Roberts and Rebecca De Mornay put in solid supporting work but it's Voight who completely steals the show from start to finish.The real star of Runaway Train though is the Alaskan backdrop. Rarely can a winter landscape have been portrayed in such beautiful, bleak monochrome tones. The cinematography is superb, and gives the whole film a strange ethereal feel which culminates in the closing scenes as Manny disappears into the white void atop the train. As endings go it's up there with Planet of the Apes as one of the best ever. The usage of Vivaldi's 'Gloria' as the music during these last sequences is just inspired.It's not perfect for sure. The scenes in the control room are not as strong as the those set on the train (or those inside the prison which make for great viewing and rank amongst the best in any prison film ever made). And in retrospect, the whole story of Ranken doggedly pursuing and catching up with Manny could easily have been dispensed with without affecting the ending. The idea of a prison warden climbing down a rope ladder from a helicopter onto a moving train is a little far-fetched to say the least! This is film-making (almost) at its best and it still makes a considerable and enjoyable impression more than 20 years after it was first released.

Ryan) has to release him. Grudgingly Ranken does but then sets out to have Manny killed as a sign of his power & authority over his prisoners. After nearly being killed in an attack Manny decides to break out with help from fellow inmate Buck (Eric Roberts), after trudging their way through the sewer system they board a train at a rail depot. At first they think they are on the way to freedom but up front the driver has had a heart attack & died, the throttle is stuck on open & the out of control unmanned train roars along the tracks heading straight for disaster...This American Israeli co-production was directed by Andrei Konchalovsky & was produced by the infamous founders of Cannon & Israeli cousins Menahem Golan & Yoram Globus but I was prepared to give Runaway Train the benefit of the doubt, I am glad I did because while Runaway Train isn't as good as a lot of the glowing IMDb user comments might suggest it's still a fine film. The script by Edward Bunker, Djordje Milicevic & Paul Zindel has a neat premise about an out of control train & feels like a forerunner to Speed (1994) which is about an out of control bus, however while two escaped convicts find themselves on an out of control train but this isn't the action packed thriller that it's plot synopsis or close resemblance to Speed might suggest, no this is a much more character driven film than it would first appear. In fact once Manny & Buck board the train that's where they stay for the rest of the films duration as they generally argue, soul search, blame each other, make guesses, talk about nothing in particular & get to know each other. There are a few things I wasn't too keen on though, for a start some of the characterisations were a little erratic like the way Manny spends the entire film trying to escape, get away & save his own skin but suddenly at the end he decides to become some sort of marter which just comes out of the blue. Then there's Ranken the Warden, the entire film he goes on about killing Manny but then says he can't die because it will cause a riot in his prison but then seems to change his mind yet again at the end & try's to shoot him, if Manny ends up dead he ends up dead no matter how he was killed so what's the difference? Then there's the really frustrating & ambiguous ending which left the film feeling very unfinished & unsatisfactory after I had invested nearly two hours of my life watching it. It's not a bad film by any means, it has some great dialogue, before it starts to contradict itself some of the characterisation had been top drawer & the storyline is quite exciting & gripping but the pace is often slow, it's a little bit repetitive & looking back after watching it I didn't think that much actually happened.Director Konchalovsky does a decent job here, the film is set in the snowy Alaskan wilderness & there's a real sense of bleak isolation. Like a lot of these out of control vehicle films there are endless shots of the train speeding along the track that all look virtually identical, in fact if you were to edit all of these shots out the film would probably be a good twenty five minutes shorter. Runaway Train can be quite a brutal film at times with stabbings & a fair amount of blood. I am not convinced that a train such as this wouldn't have had some sort of remote safety feature just in case such a scenario as in the film happened. Also the film is full of rather large & improbable coincidences, Manny & Buck sure break out of prison easy, then they find a train, then the driver just happens to drop down dead, the brakes just happen to burn off & there just happens to be a female engineer on board when there's not supposed to be one.Technically the film is very good, it's certainly well made with good effects & production design. Japanese director Akira Kurosawa co-wrote the original screenplay & had planned to direct it himself in Upstate New York but the snowstorms were so bad the plan was abandoned. Helicopter pilot Richard Holley was killed in a helicopter crash during filming. The acting is generally superb with Voight on top form while Rebecca De Mornay replaced Karen Allen.Runaway Train is a good solid thriller with great performances & a good storyline which I have to say I thought was somewhat wasted. Most of the comments on the IMDb seem to read so much into so little, maybe we watched different films I don't know but while Runaway Train is good I didn't think it was great. If you want to see a proper action film set on a train watch Steven Seagal in his best film Under Siege 2 Dark Territory (1995) instead.

You did not know, nor had any way of knowing, that the engineer of your train would die after setting the controls of the train, thus leaving you to the mercy of Mother Nature, man's architectural skills, physics, disbelief by the controllers of the automated railway system and a homicidal prison warden who will track you down at any cost.  This is the basis for the brilliantly-composed story by Ryuzo Kikushima, of what desperate men do in desperate situations.  Jon Voight, Eric Roberts and Rebecca DeMornay all give sharp performances, trying to find some hope in a situation where there is little.  This film, which I own and still watch whenever it appears on TV, never fails to leave me on the edge of my seat, even though I know what happens in the end (the end is sad but is also justifiably appropriate for the people involved).

An action film that is also an art film and as such is a classic. Jon Voight got a well deserved Oscar nomination for his role as Manny Manheim, the human animal and demigod to a group of convicts in Alaska. Voight's striking portrayal of Manheim is a light year away from his academic turned tough guy survivor in his other classic film, Deliverance. The only things keeping Manheim alive are his friendship with fellow inmate Jonah and his hatred with Warden Renken. John Ryan as Renken gives great support as a man who lives only to settle his score with Manheim, no matter what. Manheim escapes the prison with Eric Robert's Buck in tow and together they board the monster train of the title, all the while Renken is in pursuit. Roberts is great as the young convict, desperate to acheive Manny's favor. Rebecca De Mornay, stripped of frills and glamour, is forced to do something that she had never done before in her career, give an honest to God acting performance as the only other person on the train with the escapees. In fact all the performances strike the right note. Runaway Train is also a visual delight. The film (like Carpenter's remake of The Thing) perfectly captures the cold of it's scenery and will definately make you feel a chill. Watch the film on a hot summer night, in the dark with the AC cranked up and you will feel the cold. Also cold (for different reasons)is the title character, the nearly unstopable Runaway Train, a monstrous peice of cold, grey metal that plows through anything and everything on it's run. Nothing the train company does can stop this monster and it is ultimately decided to crash the train on a dead run, also dooming it's three passengers. But Voight saves Roberts and De Mornay at the conclusion as he and a captive Ryan take the final, fatal ride on the main engine, disappearing into the blizzard as a striking and depressing peice of classical music closes out the film over a quote from Shakespeare. By that time you are as exhausted and beaten down as the main characters and can do nothing but stare silently at the screen as the credits roll. An action film, an art film, a look at the nature of the human beast and a monster on the rampage movie. Runaway Train is all of these things and it's also something else. And that something is brilliant. Inarguably one of the best films of the 80s, Runaway Train deserves a place in your video library.

Buck (Roberts) is a pretty-boy punk, who's spent most of his life in prison and has a warped sense of reality.

Everything that takes place OFF the train is awful, just plain awful, even by the standards of cheap action flicks.  But everything that takes place ON the train is superb.  And I'm going to give credit for that excellence to Jon Voight, not only for his own performance, but for the performances of Eric Roberts and Rebecca De Mornay. Roberts and De Mornay have not been memorable in anything I've seen before or after Runaway Train, and while it could be the director devoted all his attention exclusively to the events on the train -- the focus of the movie, after all -- the off train scenes are so crummy that I'm hesitant to believe he was the one who inspired these actors to exceed themselves.  Admittedly, the action and the visuals are also very good during the exteriors of the train sequences and if Voight had not been involved Konchalovsky might be credited with an interesting disappointment.  But I think Voight's interactions with his co-actors compelled them to personalize their characters deeper than they were used to.  No matter how it happen, though, the results are impressive and and these truly excellent parts make watching the whole film worthwhile.

Just a few words two convicts made their escape from the prison. One of them is especially dangerous, a beast with a human face, etc... I don't think Manny is a beast. SPOILER ALERT First of all, he doesn't LOOK evil. I'm sure that our inner nature throws its light (or shadow) upon our faces, especially as we're getting older. Normally you can tell from the first glance whether a person is evil or not. OK, this is just my personal opinion.But how do we know that Manny is a villain? Does he do anything terrible? We even don't know what crime he'd committed (at least me, I don't know unless I missed something.But- He has a friend, and he cares for his friend.- He agrees to take young Buck with him; if he'd been that much of a beast, he'd just have knocked Buck out after Buck had opened the hatch and would have escaped alone.- Even more he tries to stop Buck because he understands that Buck has what to lose.- Even more he shares some grease with Buck. Without it Buck would freeze to death.- When Buck tells him about his dreams (robbing some money place) Manny tells him what he really should do if he wants to be a winner in that life (and admits he can't do this himself, AND is sorry for this).- Yes, he seems to be ready to kill a train worker but these are only words. At the same time he defended the girl from Buck.- Certainly the most cruel episode is when he's forcing Buck out to get into the cabin and is close to kill the boy when he refuses to do that. I don't think it shows his beast nature. I think it was an act of despair. He's had too much unwelcome partner too talkative and childlish, wrong train, stuck door, unexpectable witness, and 9 out of 10 for dying in the train crash. He knows HE could break the glass and stop the train if his hand weren't hurt, and he can't accept Buck's weakness because he waited too much from him. He took Buck for equal while he's nothing but a frightened lad. Don't forget that he gives up his idea of killing Buck quite easy.Manny is not a beast. Whatever got him to prison, he's paid for it. Three years in absolute isolation is pretty enough for most crimes. The fact he doesn't hate the whole world after so horrible a punishment is also in his favour. He hates only one person, and this one is worth hatred.I think Renken is a real villain. Not because he's just cruel. For a prison warden it's a part of the job description. But he's unfairly cruel. He likes to humilate, he feels a dictator not only in his prison, just everywhere. The only good feature in him is that he's not a coward. One of the reasons Manny makes his escape is that Renken had sworn not to leave him alive and with the powers he's got he'd do that quite easily. Manny has to be cruel to defend himself, Renken enjoys being cruel.This movie makes you think, what's not bad. Worth seeing at least once.

Half of it is completely forgettable, the other half utterly obscene. Much of it sounds improvised, especially an impassioned but bizarre speech-a rant, really--by Voight's character in which he **might** be advising his jailbreak junior partner to go straight while there still is time.Except for the carefully constructed replica railroad engines, the sets are cheap, the supporting cast mostly amateur.Eric Roberts, still boyish though now pushing thirty, reprises his Paulie persona from The Pope of Greenwich Village with a few southernisms thrown in. It's no dice. The character never assumes life from a collection of mannerisms. However, Jon Voight is incapable of giving a bad performance. In accents plumbed from growing up Catholic in Yonkers, NY, portraying a street-wise con who could be broken neither by a harsh system nor a brutal warden, he sounds truly tough and still looks six foot three and pretty good at age 47, about when his leading man career stalled. A best-selling book will often have as subject something people know a little about, but would like to know more. It's railroading in this case and we do learn quite a bit about it. We are taken in the control room, in the switch yard and of course on board the Runaway Train. By keeping to unities--a single story on a single day--the picture effectively builds tension toward a climax that is inevitable yet poignant. The cinematography might be the best thing about this picture, showing us the bleakly beautiful, seemingly endless frozen wastes of Alaska in mid-winter--before anyone knew about Global Warming.With the release this month of a movie on a similar theme there is bound to be a renewal of interest in this now twenty-five year old motion picture with one tenth the budget.

And the most hideous thing was  (Richard The Third) hits the end suddenly and inharmoniously; actually that was dull to a comic extant, being a slight of black comedy about how allegation and pedantry could annihilate a movie ! Yes, go ahead as I'm positive you'll do and mark my comment as unhelpful but you know what.. You can't delete my own opinion which will be proved as right someday, and for all the haters of that movie; that's the place to be, I'm the voice of you all so come on everybody. Show all the fans of that movie that you're just correct when it comes to that very low tasteless deficient work. It's not a lost gem from the 1980's; it's a lost from the 1980's.Happy Hemorrhoids !

But the more I read, the more I had to say what? This movie is Tarkovsky-like? Just like a Kurosawa? Up there with Blade Runner? Let me just say one thing ARE YOU PEOPLE OUT OF YOUR MINDS??? Yes, yes, I know this director worked with Tarkovsky. But working with Tarkovsky does not entitle this melodramatic pile of donkey butt to the rights of being Tarkovsky-like. Has anyone here making those comments seen a Tarkovsky? If you like Runaway Train, you are not sitting quietly through a Tarkovsky, I can guarantee you that. Most Tarkovsky fans can't even make that claim! And I know that Akira Kurosawa had his thumb in the fingerbowl of this story, but come on now. Are you really going to try to put this movie next to a Kurosawa, even at his worst?  Not a chance. Blade Runner? Runaway Train is closer to a prettier version (scenery and cinematography-wise) of Speed. No, make that Speed 2. These movies are closer in kin. Check dialogue, acting, plot, action sequences. Sorry, folks. I saw the lovefest going on for this midnight stinker, saw the bad comparisons drawn, and I got outraged. Had to voice my opinion. Peace.

How many action films of the past decade feature real 3-dimentional characters that seem like real people with real problems in real situations? One, if any. How many action films of the past decade have a script this well-written? Maybe one. Anyway...the basic plot goes like this Two dudes escape from jail and hop on board a train. Only thing is, the conductor dies and the train is now speeding out of control. I will not give anything else away, but I will say this. If you are looking for an action-packed movie that is also very well-made, then this is for you.Fans of the matrix reloaded and michael bay movies should especially watch this to see what a good action film is like.

Some ham-fisted symbolism and overwrought Nietzchean philosophy undermine the genuinely exciting action sequences, but Jon Voight's muscular performance and some first-rate photography and editing help distract attention away from the pretensions of the script, which might have suffered in translation through four successive writers. Overall the film presents an odd, uncomfortable mixture of classic European art-house cinema and Hollywood blockbuster action dynamics, set at a breakneck pace and given the texture and urgency of a nightmare.

This movie is brutal in that regard, but it's still such an interesting story and character portrait that I still look at it but not often. Jon Voight's character is the only reason I would look at it again.Voight, as Manny, provides about as intense and good an acting performance as you could ask for. He's riveting in here. As tough as he is - a hardened criminal who escapes from prison with Buck (Eric Roberts) - he Roberts a little speech during this story which is about as good a parable as Jesus gave in His brief stay on Earth. He lectures his friend about being humble enough to serve, even in the most humiliating circumstances. I've just never forgotten Voight's speech.This is an action-packed, rough film with rough people and very rough language. The language is actually ludicrous at times with over-the-top characters like the ones played by John P. Ryan and Kenneth McMillian, two of the most profane actors of their day. Being a Golan-Globus film of the period ('70s and '80s), this film is overridden by low-life characters, a trademark of those scummy filmmakers.Back on the positive side, the story features great suspense, and a real feel for the bleak, snowy Alaskan terrain. The last 30 minutes is the best, because of less dialog, a pounding music beat and a great, memorable ending.Overall, if you can take the blaspheming assault on your ears, this movie is worth it for the great adventure and atmospheric feel of cold and suffering....and, if for nothing else, Voight's fabulous performance.

The director's name sounds just like that of a film-making auteur, and it was up for a number of acting Oscars (something that almost never comes to action/adventure genre). I'll admit, I was fearing that the film would have a great action premise but instead have its actors go into dramatics and debate philosophy and their own mortality, or something like that. Fear not, however. Runaway Train is an action movie, and it's perfect for watching in one's living room.Manny (Jon Voight) is the toughest prisoner at a maximum security prison deep in the heart of Alaska. He's a hero to all the inmates, particularly Buck (Eric Roberts). When Manny decides to escape, Buck tags along. But their ride to freedom comes into deadly conflict when the train that they hitch a ride on loses its conductor to a heart attack.The acting varies; Jon Voight was awarded an Oscar nomination for his performance here, and while usually effective, it's nothing special. Manny is fiercely independent, and cares about no one. It's a survival mechanism that he has, and no one will get in his way of doing whatever he sets his mind to. The real surprise is Eric Roberts as Buck. Buck idolizes Manny, and wants to be his partner in their escape. But the dim-witted Buck learns the hard way that our heroes are not always what they seem. I have yet to understand why Rebecca DeMornay gets work; she can't act, and the only reasonable performance she has was in Risky Business. Of course, that was made only a few years before this film, so it makes sense that she was cast. But it does begin to show her non-existent talent. John P. Ryan is perfectly cast as Ranken, the prison warden who hates Manny so much that he's itching for an excuse to kill him (this is never really explained, but it's not particularly important anyway).Connections to the future action hit Speed are warranted, although the later film is eons better than this one. In this type of film, the most important determining factor in its success is its execution. Runaway Train is well made, and contains a consistent level of tension throughout.Unfortunately, the film does attempt to ask some philosophical questions about human nature in times of crisis. This wouldn't be a bad thing, except that these questions seem grafted on at the last minute, and the characters aren't developed enough to make it really work.Runaway Train is a good thriller, and well worth a look, but its attempts to do something audacious and profound bring down the project more than a couple of notches in quality.

First of all, I just did not like John Voight's tough guy character or his thug-like accent. But I did think Eric Roberts character was more likable and he played it well. The first third of the movie takes place in an Alaskan prison, supposedly. It shows the inmates burning cloths and throwing them out of their cells while the guards just look on.. OK. The prison warden Ranken patronizes Manny, John Voight's character as he is going to be released from prison due to some legal action. But he screws up his release by starting a riot at one of the boxing matches held inside the prison. Yes, a cold, die-hard killer is released into the regular inmate population. So, Manny and his fellow inmate manage to break out of the actual prison,, and go smear some gooey stuff all over themselves,, then wrap themselves in Saran wrap- why? I don't know,, couldn't figure that out,, maybe to stay warm? Then they travel miles to a train station, where they steal some clothes (no sign of the gooey stuff) and try and hitch a ride on a train. They manage to get on one of the locomotives that has gotten loose, and unbeknownst to them, is also being occupied by a young female rail road worker. The movie picks up in pace and manages to do its job,, and the ending is forgivable.

That can be the only explanation for both of them playing apparently retarded characters. The only suspense in the film is to see which of the two will end up giving a worse performance. De Mornay's acting is not particularly good either, but compared to Voight and Roberts, she's Meryl Streep. The acting by the rest of the cast is also dreadful and the direction is amateurish.
