Few people will say this movie is fair. Instead, people often call it the best movie ever made or the worst... and they mean it! Even its severest critics grudgingly admit that it's visually stunning and has perhaps the best soundtrack of the decade (Happy Worker is a classic, and At the Closing of the Year is, in my opinion, the best Christmas song written in the past 30 years). It's clearly Oscar-worthy in the categories of music and set design. Most people who've seen it agree that Joan Cusack's quirky characterization is wonderful and that the vignettes provided Robin Williams with a springboard for some of the best ad libs of his career. And the story, a whimsical fable of innocence versus corruption, is as unlikely to give offense as any you can name. So, you'd expect the movie's critics to say I didn't care for it, instead of Everyone associated with this movie should be ashamed!When I like something and others don't, I hesitate to say they don't get it, but in the case of Toys, it really is true. It's no coincidence that many visual references to the work of Rene Magritte keep popping up. Toys is a surrealist movie, and like any work of surrealism, it has a simple veneer over a more sophisticated message, one that defies explanation and works on the level of a dream. This movie is more Mulholland Drive than Willie Wonka.Whether you will like this movie depends entirely on how your mind works. Poets will probably love it. Engineers will probably hate it.

I don't think about things like that when watching a movie at first.  I just decide if I was entertained or not. I was.Toys uses Williams' natural exuberance and Cusack's looniness to its benefit and make them the most unique characters in a movie that ISN'T about toys as much as it is childhood, life, death and whatever happens to be in between.  I especially liked Cusack's comment at her father's funeral about the tin horn.Gambon plays the serious-minded adult who traipses into toyland and decides to declare war.  What happens?  About what you'd expect.  Or maybe not, I dunno.  What can you expect in a movie where it makes up its own rules along the way, just like a child at play?I loved the production design and a lot of toys are just downright cute.  Williams' speech to the toys near the end that hybrids Gandhi and Churchill with a little of Begin the Beguine is a classic in my book.  And Cusack's fate is somewhat of a shock.  LL Cool J does a pretty good job as does Gambon.  Wright is pretty, as always, and you have to love that down-home accent (and dolphin imitation).In the end, Toys breaks free of the world like the elephant during the end credits, making a world all its own, one where children's rules apply and simply allowing yourself to be a child is the perfect remedy to adulthood.  Maybe THAT'S what a lot of people don't understand about this movie. Nice Job, Barry.Ten stars and a smoking jacket for Toys, the movie that proves there's a time and a place for children's things, as long as you don't let growing up spoil it for you.

Nothing could be further from the truth though, as it is a movie of surprising depth and style.The first point that must be covered is the performance given by Robin Williams as Leslie Zevo. Although it is fraught with his almost trademark wackiness there is an underlying current of a man who is on the edge of coming into his own. The layers of the character he plays are subtly shown, as Leslie is a man who is strong, but unsure of his strength and covers that insecurity with comedy and whimsy.The film is visually striking, a real art department tour de force, and is very much removed from any hint of the past at first glance. Looking deeper into the visuals however reveals the films deeper content of classic surrealist motifs, especially that of dismembered body parts and other parts separated from the whole. Partially assembled dolls, the parts of which come out of machines that are shaped as further separated body parts, are shown throughout. Alsatia lives in rooms within rooms that seem separated from the wholeness of houses, and indeed lives in a paper fold-out doll house herself, the reasons for which become quite apparent by the films end.This aesthetic choice, combined with the toys vs. weapons juxtaposition makes the films textual purpose clear. Toys is a surrealist reaction to the end of the Cold War, in the very same vein as the original surrealists reactions to the end of the First World War. The film even makes several direct references to one of the surrealist masters, Rene Magrite, especially in the music video sequence. This places Toys in a very deep anti-war tradition, one that is expressed very openly in the entire premise of a General taking control of a toy company and turning it to military purpose.Any who would dismiss this film as merely childish surely owe it to themselves to take another look at this surrealist masterpiece and lose themselves in the quirky visuals and creative world that is placed on screen.

Director Barry Levinson, a sometimes brilliant writer, used his considerable prestige to make this very big film built around this very simple analogy  War is bad/innocence (toys) is good.  This film would have had more relevance in 1972 than 1992.  As it is, it is two decades too late and two tons too heavy.  Worse still, the climax is directly contradicts the theme of the film.  Robin Williams is only able to gain the maturity to take control of the company by waging a toy war.  Hmmmm, maybe war isn't so bad after all.  Still, the film is not a total washout.  The sets are quite imaginative, and the film does manage to generate an interesting atmosphere - if you're in the mood for such things.  The most interesting thing, however, is the casting of rapper LL Cool J as Michael Gambon's son and Robin Williams' cousin.  No explanation is given for the fact that he's African-American.

Although one would hope for at least so bad it's good status to salvage some value from the rental cost, the many long, dry, humorless scenes make the two hours wasted on this mess at best regrettable. Apparently Barry Levinson leveraged his hit-making track record to get $43 million to make this utter bomb, scorned by audiences and critics alike. The studio execs were probably horrified when they screened it but not surprised when it failed to bring in $24 million in tickets before it slunk out of the theaters.

At a young age I was fascinated by such a visually beautiful and surreal world that this mostly forgotten and seldom talked about film portrays. While the story of the film, which you can read about in the other reviews, is not the most well put together or best flowing story ever written, the witty comedy and especially the surrealism of it make up for this. Even Roger Ebert wrote in his review Visually one of the most extraordinary films I've seen, a delight for the eyes, a bright new world.While Toys was a box office flop and panned by critics, if you ask me, they failed to fully indulge themselves in the power of the film and it's special message about peace, joy, and innocence prevailing over war and evil.If you are a fan of Salvador Dali's work or just a fan of surrealism in general, Toys is the perfect film for you. It's hard to think of another film with such vivid set designs that uses surrealism is such a creative and intelligent way.

First, it is the closest I have seen a director come to creating a Kubrick style of filmaking.  However, the ending for this movie is terrible.Toys is about a man named Leslie Zevo whose father's toy company is taken over by his uncle, General Leland Zevo.  The General tries to change the toy line from wind-up toys and dolls to military equipment and is trying to create a toy army operated by little children on remote the control.  The plot sounds far fetched but it works.The beginning of this movie if flawless. The entire production design was definately Oscar worthy.  Barry Levinson manages to create this incredible world.  I actually did feel like I as watching a Stanley Kubrick film because of the camera and design.  There's one chilling scene were Robin Williams is discussing some of the novelty items the company will produce and as he does it the walls of the room he is in slowly close in because the General needs more space to build his war toys.  Out of all the films I've seen in the 90's this scene would rank as one of the most memorable amoung them.The performances are good.  Michael Gambon and Robin Williams are both strong (I think Robin Wright was mis-cast though).  However, Joan Cusack gives one of the most incredible performances I've ever seen.  She plays a very child like adult, almost retarded but doesn't quite cross the line. The risks she takes and her characterization are all brilliant.  There is one momennt when she is at her father's funeral and she just talks about how the word tinhorns stays with her.  It's so beautiful and pure.Now, about the ending.  There is a scene in the film where the General tries to kill a fly with a gun.  The movie should have ended with him trying to shoot the fly, but then shooting himself.  However, there is this whole cliche plotline about bad guys becoming good, there's a toy battle which goes against the thematic elements of the movie, and there's an unesecary love scene that ruins the Kubrickian mood.  The ending actually reminded me of a movie called Baby Geniuses and anyone who has seen both movies (which I'm sure is unlikely) will agree with me.Oh well, if you see Toys watch up to the scene with the General and the fly and then stop.  If you do this, you will have one of the most enjoyable cinematic experiences of your life.

Seeing an opportunity, the General decides to hijack the traditional methods and mentality of the factory and build a new type of tech; war toys, designed to be economically lethal. Finding this out, it is up to our heroes, along with some friends like the General's camoflauge-happy son (LL Cool J) and a copy girl who falls in love with Williams' character, to stop him.A case of 'wrong place, wrong time', Levinson odd little film is, though not without faults, surprisingly forward thinking about the desensitisation of youth and the dehumanisation of war. Today, that issue is much the rage (how often have we heard COD being called Propaganda/Army Porn or the use of drones), and in a post Columbine world, the idea of a youth perverted by the lack of distinguishing fantasy from reality is very potent, and one feels that 'Toys' would've been better served coming out now.What's more, this also qualifies as one of the oddest studio films ever; from the Rene Magritte-centric production design to the interesting mix of actors here, though they all fit their roles well. The late Williams is very much the star of the show, and the child-like, jokey nature of this character fits him like a glove. Cusack as his doll-like sister also does well, giving the role a very youthful, almost eternally naive, quality. Joining them is the always superb Gambon as the pompous and crusty General, and he's having quite the ball in the role, and even Cool J as his son isn't half bad either, and actually has some good comic timing, especially given how meticulous his character is about proper military procedures. We even have Yeardley Smith and Jamie Foxx in small background roles.However, some tonal indecisions, such as going from the dark subject matter to Williams' ad libs and wacky sight gags like a literal smoking jacket or fake vomit recipes, and a laggy climax involving a rather drawn out toy war do deflate things. In fact, that sums up why I believe the film's rep is so uncertain among critics and audiences; who is the target audience of the film? Is it an anti- war/protect our youth's innocence message for adults, or a quirky, oddball adventure for kids? It's like Levinson wants a live-action Ghibli film, but that careful blend of childhood magic and adult themes is off, making for an uneven, though still oddly fascinating, viewing experience.Honestly, 'Toys' is worth seeing once as a ambitious novelty. It's such an odd mix of ideas, stories and even practices that there is really no movie like it out there, and it's sort of interesting seeing where it'll go or what it'll do next. Sometimes, a unique misfire is better than mediocre success. "},{"Title":"Save your receipt.

So how do you rate a movie like this? It's beautiful to look at but nothing of interest happens to the characters.The set designs by the late Fernando Scarfiotti are phenomenal. The enormous six-color factory is a sight to behold. These toy-shaped factory machines would have humbled Willy Wonka. There are rooms that look like the inside of a gigantic toy chest. There is a life-sized dollhouse in the movie that opens like a 3 dimensional Christmas card and it is awe-inspiring.I also liked the music. It opens with a gloriously winsome Christmas song 'The Closing of the Year' and continues on with a curiously strange ditty called 'Happy Workers'. We see the sights and we hear the music that would humble anyone responsible for putting together the Christmas show at Radio City Music Hall. Then we wait for a story and wait and wait and wait. What there is, is very weak.Robin Williams plays playful Leslie Zevo whose dying father has decided not to leave his factory to his immature son. Nor to his daughter Alsatia (Joan Cusack) who dresses like a doll. Instead he decides to leave the factory to his brother a career military man who is interested in turning out war toys. Later we aren't surprised to find that he has more sinister motives in mind.Robin Williams is an inspired choice for this movie. He has some moments that are perfect for him; he has been given a colorful world to play in that seems build for his style of humor. But he is at the mercy of a screenplay that can't let him use his comic gifts to tell a good story.The message of 'Toys' is painfully inane Peaceful toys are good and weapons are bad. The movie is agonizingly paced. Even at two hours the movie feels too long. Unlike this movie's ancestor 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' in which the message seemed was 'Behave yourself', the message of this movie gets muddled when peaceful toys begin a toy wars with the weapons.'Toys' was directed by Barry Levinson who has made great films like 'Diner', 'Good Morning Vietnam', 'Avalon' and 'Bugsy'.

Sure, the Zevo factory turned out no guns, no replicas of World War Two tanks, no violent arcade games.  Their toys lacked all traces of violence - a virtue, but an entirely negative virtue.  There wasn't anything GOOD about the oversized, sticky-coloured plastic, ugly, gimmicky trash that they sold to children, and there was no disguising this.  Most of the toys looked as if they wouldn't be out of place in a horror movie about demonic animated dolls.  All looked crude and under-designed.  How can we be expected to cheer for them?Likewise, while the Zevo factory was no doubt meant to be a cheerful, progressive workplace, it comes across as a totalitarian nightmare.  It's hard to avoid the impression that employees are FORCED to smile and dance all the time.  The decor alone probably makes them want to scream.  It has a similar effect on me.  After a while I just couldn't stand this world consisting of colours that children are supposed to like cadmium red, bright yellow, middlebrow blue.  Maybe very small children DO like these colours.  They also like pure sugar crystals, and for much the same reason.The basic story is a strong one and it's all that makes the film watchable.  It IS watchable.  But you have to look behind almost every frame and pretend, against the evidence of your senses, that Zevo's factory is worth preserving.  You also have to ignore Robin William's inappropriate performance, Robin Wright's sickening and extraneous character, and the fact that, every so often, for no reason whatever, the film becomes a music video.  I'm not joking.  I don't simply mean that the editing is bad I mean that the film actually lapses, literally, into music video, much as West Side Story lapses into song and dance - except that in West Side Story it isn't a lapse.

It is exquisitely wrapped. The box it is in is hand crafted out of the finest wood and shows skill down to the smallest detail. That is then wrapped in gorgeous paper, handmade and hand-painted by the most talented of artists. The whole thing is wrapped in ribbons made from fine silk lace. It is a sight to behold.Then you cut the ribbon, rip off the paper, open up the box, and find...nothing. That's TOYS. You either enjoy the packaging, or forget about it.The film isn't without its point and purpose War is a not a good thing. Well, isn't that original! The moral is so obvious that it is almost embarrassing to even point it out. And even that feeble insight is undercut by a story in which elements of war -- war toys in particular -- are clearly a bad thing, until they need an exciting climax and the film simulates a war using innocent toys. It's like someone preaching a stern, condescending sermon, only to end by saying Just kidding.But even as an empty box, the film fails close scrutiny. Yes, it is a sight to behold with some remarkable, striking images. The sets are imaginative and the cinematography catches the colorful scenes with skill. But the images are cold and emotionally sterile. Like the screenplay, the look of the film is joyless and at times aesthetically barren and surreal. It is a film that wants to praise toys as wonderful and special things, yet shows them to be creations of a world that is empty and cold. The film strives to be funny, in a morose sort of way, but the humor is forced and artificial. Robin Williams, as the beleaguered heir to a toy manufacturing empire, tosses in his ad-lib shtick, which only seems alien to the bizarre, coldly structured world he is inhabiting. Indeed, the topical references and tasteless sexual innuendo that are scattered throughout are jarringly contradictory to the childlike fable the film is vaguely trying to be. For this film to work, or make sense, it needs to be set in its own universe, an Oz far removed from Kansas. Every time the jokes jerk us back into reality, the toyland of the film increasingly becomes an obvious sham.It is said that this was director Barry Levinson's pet project, one that he had been striving to get made for ten years. It is sadly obvious why he had trouble getting backing. Like most pet projects that finally get made (RADIOLAND MURDERS, RADIO FLYER & BATTLEFIELD EARTH being great examples) it seems to be a blind spot in the filmmaker's field of vision. Perhaps Levinson directed and redirected TOYS so often in his head that he no fresh vision for it when he finally got on the soundstage. He had already perfected it to death.Many of the toys featured in the film are clumsy, mechanical, wind-up monstrosities. So is the film itself.

The way it promotes the use of toys, inventiveness, and comradeship, over trivialities like guns, and war, is something to admire, respect, and in turn, as well, promote to everyone else. Hardly anyone in America heard from this movie, precisely on account of its message that guns aren't needed to live in peace and find happiness, and that war only creates terror and horror to others but the select few who choose to promote, because of self centered egoistic reasons.

It's hard to say what it is, from the amount of fun these products introduced and how much feeling we put into them the more we played. Yeah, I remember having a ball playing with Transformers and He-Man. All the same, toys have bought out the best positive qualities in us, but most importantly life itself.I'm probably going to be in the minority on this but I think this is an under the radar gem. This film in a way is sort of a Roald Dahl tale but for adults. Like in that author's stories he puts fairy tales into the modern world.The visuals and production value of the film are just amazing, because their all practical and were done on a high budget which I'll say is money that was well spent. They really did a great job at making the world in the film seem one step in the realm of fantasy but also one step in our contemporary reality. There are so many moments of visual joy, I don't want to give too many of them away. Two of my favorites set pieces of visual are one with a house that acts like a pop up book from the way it opens. But my favorite in the scene with the walls closing in where its pretty much a 3D crossword puzzle, where there are different sections in different configurations coming out and coming together.The music score from one of my favorite composers Hans Zimer is great and I personal thing this film has one of the best and most underrated scores/soundtracks. Two of my favorite music tracks in the one in the final conflict and the other was when Leland Zemo gives a speech about his master plan as there were fireworks blazing.But most importantly what powers the film is the story and characters, which I feel is imaginative and has a lot of heart. Even like the humor, though I wouldn't say it's always ha ha funny, after all this film is more of a fantasy, thriller, drama which I'll admit is a great combination and shows that you can do more with the fantasy genre.Supporting characters are really great, Joan Cusack as Alsatin Zevo is great, her character reminds me a little of Mabel from the TV show Gravity Falls like Mabel she is bright cheerful but really odd. And we of course near the end discover why she a bit out of sorts.Robin Wright is solid as Gwen Tyler. She's kind of the straight one but she has a bit of a quarky humorous side to her that comes out a bit more as she interacts with Leslie more. I really like the chemistry between both the characters, it really feels like both were kinda made for one another. Though the only bad thing is both don't have enough scenes together, which to me is the only weak point of the film.And of course the main protagonist, Robin Williams one of my favorite comedians and actors is great in this film which is part of why this is one of my favorite films with him and I really like his character Leslie Zevo. His character is pretty much a man child, he's a lot of fun, has a great odd kinda quarky sense of humor. I really love how inventive the the gags and toys he creates like a smoking jacket or magnetic deviled egg. If the character has a weakness is simply just that he's a man child which makes him unsure of himself and unable to take complete responsibility, and he's aware of this. This is part of what makes us want him to win, we know that he is the rightful owner of Zevo toys but he has to prove himself worthy first, he's got to learn to step up and take it. The antagonist Lt. General Leland Zevo played well by Michael Gambon. Yeah I've seen the Harry Potter films though I remember him best in a Doctor Who Christmas special. Anyway Leland is a solid and even scary villain, he's pretty much a power mad general. One scene which really justifies how far off the reservation he's gone is when Leland is playing some tank video game and he is constantly shooting the UN trucks and just madly enjoying himself. That scene was great because it showed two things; one a simplistic suttle way of showing the depth of an antagonist damaged psyche, which I thing is great because it presents how dangerous the antagonist is. Two, showing the video games don't cause people to do acts of violence, the perpetrators that played the games were crazy to begin with.Leland's plot I'll admit is frighteningly plausible and really scary if you think about it. With the drone technology we have now, whose to say some higher up won't think of pulling strings to make it happen, tricking kids into thinning their playing a video game when their actually destroying real cars and people with these drones. It's an evil plan because not just is it turning kids into killers but it's murdering their innocence. This all the more makes you want the protagonists to win, this evil plan that shouldn't succeed but it's also a fight for the right of innocence to live.This film I think has a great message on the importance of letting the positive beautiful things in life like love, laughter, joy prevail over the negative aspects greed, power, and war.Like any toy to play with this film is a joy to play with.Rating 4 stars "},{"Title":"Nonsensical, unneeded and pointless, therefor it is beautiful.","Date":"1 April 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama","Review":" I saw 'Toys' at age 12 and again last night, now being 16. Before seeing it last night I tried to drum up all of my previous memories of this film. I recalled it being wildly colorful, creative and entertaining, and it held an important message. Upon a re-watch, I realized that I still identify with most of my earlier observations, but being older and more mature, with more knowledge in general, I came to appreciate something else the film had to offer. As far as the message goes, as a child it seemed so concrete. But now older I find it hard to pin down. But it has something to do with the inner child being extinguished by the quote-unquote real world. Robin Williams is in this film. I loved him as a child, I found him funny and entertaining as well as serious when needed. His face drums up memories of Jumanji and Bicentennial Man. In this film plays the son of an eccentric toy factory owner. Where is this toy factory? The location is never established, and I believe that is intentional. Any scenery outside of the toy factory consists of rolling green fields that stretch all the way to the perfect blue sky, meeting at the horizon. The factory within is even more colorful, with bright blues, reds, whites and yellows that reminds us of childhood with its brightly colored plastic toys. Many of which are featured in this film, especially around the climax. We also see many cute, nonsensical things, such as toy ducks crossing a hallway while some characters sit and wait in their car. Why do they wait for the ducks to cross? What would it matter if the car simply ran over the lifeless, plastic ducks? Or for that matter, why do the characters dress so brightly with unnecessary flares and silly gimmicks? (ex Robin Williams's character at one point is wearing a jacket that produces smoke, a smoking jacket) Of course this leads one to the question, what's the purpose of aesthetics or art at all? Here the film makes a valid and pressing point. I came to realize that it is not in fact purposeless at all. The purpose is that the character wearing the silly outfit wants it that way. That is how he/she prefers it. The characters here live in a world without judgment and are free to express themselves. I have a feeling that if people were given unlimited resources and freedom from judgment, they would dress like this in a world like this. Then I came to realize this this film, with its rolling green hills and perfect blue skies outside of the factory, and pure unprejudiced creation within the factory, takes place inside the mind. If you had to draw the interior of the mind, how would you draw it? Then when I realized that, everything else in the film seemed to match up nicely with human thoughts. The factory in 'Toys' is our idea of a perfect existence, being able to do whatever we wanted, free of judgment, having as much fun as possible and never growing up. This is childhood. But as the reader knows, childhood is not forever. Eventually we grow up and act not in interest of having fun as much as acting to avoid judgment or avoid bad judgment. We want to move along in unison with the rest of the people who had grown up to want the same thing. From out of this idea we get our villain, the uniformed general and brother to the original factory owner. He's what we'd call grown up and here to destroy everything childish and have the factory start producing war toys. This is our mind reaching what is called maturity. Society tells us that maturity is good, even though we can feel our inner child dying (which is also illustrated in the film, by showing a graphic toy war with flying plastic chunks and sparks). Nonetheless, the film then turns around and does something most people growing up do not do. The general, symbolizing maturity, is vanquished and the characters go on with their happy existence. Following my simile about the human mind, this part can seem confusing. But after deliberation, I concluded that the mind in the film had rid itself of the need to mature, and therefor was forever happy, free of judgment and free to express. I have a feeling that if this film was understood by more people in the way that I do, the message would be followed religiously and the film labeled as a holy scripture. It's why self-help books are so popular and for that matter, it is also why religions like Taoism, Buddhism and other beliefs that promise enlightenment are so popular. If you are a Taoist and you understand this film like I do, it would seem to be a work of art, an achievement of bliss and a goal to strive for. I give it a 9 out of 10. The only unnecessary part was discovering that (SPOILER) the sister was a robot. There is really no point to this, but having said what I did earlier about things that seem pointless, I will not complain.

I have a signed photo of Robin Williams from a scene of this film; he addressed it 'make love, not war' and that is what this film is trying to say. Please, do human-kind a favor and just criticize a film like this for what it says, not for the 'laughs' you expect or other mindless drivel. Perhaps this is a modern fairy tale. This is not a vehicle for anyone. Yes, it's silly and childish at times, but only to set the blithe, 'childlike' point-of-view of the film and to amplify the the 'governmental' desire to attack on 'provocation' when in reality, there is probably none. Basically, this is entails a man's obsession with war and the paranoia that it induces, and what ultimately overcomes is a joking, playful, and somewhat sarcastic sense of humor. It's comically frightening, in the way 'Dr. Strangelove' is, in it's loose, flippantly accepting madness. Please, think more before judging this wonderful film and what it's trying to say. Please, do not go into this one expecting wall to wall humor. This has some definite comedic moments, but don't lose sight of the fact that their 'land' is metaphoric and whatever 'silliness' is perceived is for artistic reasons and to amplify the childlike mood of the film and how innocence can be easily influenced or destroyed. Please don't look at this film as a comedy or some sort of light entertainment. Try and look into your heart and find it's statements, not it's 'idiocies' in which ways too many try to write it off. It's more important nowadays than ever!

But because it was considered a Hollywood production directed by Barry Levinson, many critics attacked it because they expected something more noteworthy from him.  Audiences simply didn't get the film, thinking it was for kids and not understanding this is basically an adult fantasy, expressing the joy of having a bit of child and good in all of us.For the rest of us who got it, this is a breathtaking, joyous experience!  The detail in every shot is simply astounding, the music is very appropriate and like a character within the story, and the story is like a wondrous fairy tale.  I admit I'm not much of a Robin Williams fan or of LL Cool J's lip-licking, and the film may seem a bit long at just over 2 hours, but Toys is such a unique work of art I never tire of watching it.  The visuals are the most stunning I've ever seen in a film--like a moving Magritte painting, and the story is captivating enough to believe. The idea of a war-obsessed military man recruiting children to be the future fighters by controlling war machines from video game-type setups is not too a farfetched idea, and rather unsettling.  We may know that this film would not have an unhappy ending, but we still get wrapped up in a brother and sister's battle to save the toy factory...and the world!  Robin Williams and Joan Cusack work so well together, and Joan's character Alsatia is so endearing.  She's my favorite.  The music....the collaberation between Hans Zimmer and Trevor Horn is genius.  Then, add a multitude of original recordings by Tori Amos (her song Happy Workers was one of the most requested songs on my radio show), Thomas Dolby, Wendy & Lisa, Frankie Goes To Hollywood, Seal, Pat Metheny and additional contributions by Grace Jones, Jane Siberry, Bruce Woolley,and Peter Gabriel,  the effort on the musical aspect of Toys is mind-boggling and perfect!  It's too bad the soundtrack CD doesn't contain the complete full-length of some songs (The Closing Of The Year is tremendously longer on the end credits than on the CD).Toys was a dream project that Barry Levinson had wanted to work on and I for one am thankful he shared this vision with us.  I can understand how this film was a gamble but for those of us who understand and appreciate what Levinson's intentions were, watching Toys is like a really nice Christmas present that you'll cherish for years.  Vastly misunderstood and underrated, Toys is a true work of art and genius! This to me is how a film can be so wondrous. I still love Toys as much as when I first saw it in a theatre back in 1992, and watch it now and then to get a guaranteed wonderful feeling inside!LET JOY AND INNOCENCE PREVAIL!

Happy Workers is very slick but the opening song (used as prelude and postlude) is really heartwarming.If you are looking for a movie to WATCH this is it.

It's a disaster. It will rightfully be remembered as one of the most atrocious cinematic disasters of our time. And yet it shouldn't be--it is directed by Barry Levinson (Good Morning, Vietnam, Rainman), stars Robin Williams, Robin Wright, Joan Cusack, and was Levinson's dream project not touched by any studio until his first few films were hits.The direction is muddled, the tone goofy and the elements child-like. It plays like a family film but it isn't--its PG-13 rating is evidence of that. It's about toys and war--and if you think that sounds a bit silly, you're right. It's a bit distressing to hear this was Levinson's dream project--what in the world would make him want to make this piece of garbage?It opens with a man on his deathbed named Kenneth Zevo (Donald O'Connor). Zevo owns a prosperous toy company that manufactures millions of children-friendly toys. Aware of his close fatality, he decides to hand over his company to The General (Michael Gambon), a military extremist. After his death, The General does, indeed, take over the company, and he starts to manufacture military games to pollute children's minds.Zevo also had a son and a daughter, Leslie (Robin Williams) and Alsatia (Joan Cusack), the latter of whom is very quacky and not so bright. Leslie, on the other hand, is just a bit too eccentric to own a toy company. But he has morals--when he hears of his brother's new military toys, he is maddened and tries to take back his father's company and restore it to its original state.The cast also includes LL Cool J as The General's son, who is a camoflauge extraordinare. He is the muscle man and bodyguard of the movie. But he doesn't carry the same unspoken intimidation that Oddjob did in Goldfinger, a movie of much greater quality.Toys seems inspired, to a point, but it doesn't go anywhere. The overall tone of the film is just wrong--have you ever seen Streetfighter with Jean-Claude Van Damme? Yeah, it feels like that--awkward, childish and downright stupid. Of course, it is an alternate universe of toys we're talking about, but something still doesn't click--they can make the movie bright, looney and original without resorting to Streetfighter ineptness.Robin Williams seems at home as an odd toy maker. Joan Cusack has always been a bit odd--she fits here. Robin Wright (Penn), as the love interest of the film, is not needed but we all know that every story needs a love interest. And Barry Levinson is a terrific director, who has made more than a handful of good, quality films. Which is why Toys is simply unacceptable.Barry Levinson directed better with Rainman, Robin Williams was more lovable as an eccentric, good-natured man in Jumanji (1995), Joan Cusack was funnier in My Blue Heaven (1990), and Robin Wright (Penn) was a great deal better in The Princess Bride (1987) and a little movie with Tom Hanks about a guy named Gump. (Forrest Gump, 1994.) Any way you slice and dice it, Toys is in a league of its own as one of the biggest disappointments in the history of filmmaking. Visually, it's a delight.

Michael Gambon, as the 'baddie', also gives what must be a career-worst movie performance and his character is more sleep-inducing than threatening. Williams also puts in what is one of his irritating/nerve-grating performances and his one-liners fly off at such speed that they can hardly be understood (and when you have really strained yourself enough to hear one, you rapidly conclude that it was not worth the effort in any case).The GOOD news this film is an absolute visual treat. I remember being totally blown away when I saw this upon release in 1992 on the big screen and (despite having seen it quite a few times on the small screen subsequently) would go virtually any distance to see it in that format again. The factory production lines, the 'house' Williams and his sister live in and, in particular, the countryside around the toy factory (and Williams' father's 'grave site') are just stunning visual statements and ones you can never tire of. Secondly, the musical accompaniment is very good (even if not always perhaps in line with the development of the plot) and, in the case of 'The Mirror Song', is accompanied by a really neat video backdrop. Thirdly, Joan Cusack gives a gloriously wacky performance as Williams' sister which easily outshines him and really embodies the mad-cap, zany atmosphere I am sure the script writers and director had in mind (and which Gambon and Williams are light years away from achieving to any degree at all).Overall, then, a real mixed bag but, in my view, certainly a film worth seeing at least once and one which, with two different male leads and better script work, could have become a real 'cult' film (a la 'Tron') (and which, incidentally, has become even more interesting in plot terms when you consider the use of drones (pilotless aircraft) as a regular feature now of warfare in the 'war on terror'!)

But let's review what *really* happened; He wanted to go Hollywood yet by his own rules, so the flashy movie must have a substance. He glided into not big budget. And he was unfortunately in his worst artistic condition too!The outcome of that was so bad on all the levels. As a political satire it's pathetic. As a comedy it's an outrageous flop; giving the feeling that it is a typical French comedy ! And as an action (Levinson) did a perfect job to destroy everything, starting with the ugly narrow cadres, to the hideous slow-motion, the crappy war toys, the primitive special effects, ending with that embarrassing climactic battle. In brief (Levinson) didn't liven a thing, mastering one strangled movie! The script is dreamy, however the treatment killed it utterly. Take for instance the relationship between the lead and his girl. (Robin Wright) did nothing but laughing at the lead's jokes all the time like an idiot, then at one very early &#x96; very serious &#x96; point she judges him as if he's her long time lover !! Did you notice how she didn't add anything to the conflict later ?! Another matter; so the alleged sister is a toy, what's the point of that ?

On a deeper level why the fantasy was that disappointed? as we were just watching things that happen in some factor (!!). Otherwise, it could have enriched the movie's personality to be more vivid and lovable. Actually the reason why this was deadly poor remains at 3 questions  why it wasn't made as a frank fantasy? Or a musical ? Or a cartoon ? I bet with being the 3 together, having a real funny material, it should have been more balanced and useful, because I was watching politics meeting Disney's lowest TV movie !Speaking about funny, it has unfunny time to the max. The dialog isn't any good, and with the dark directing the whole thing turned into horrible. The moments in-between the serious talks diversified at making disgusting gags every time (vomit, fart jokes, someone shoots his own feet, head that goes off,&#x85;) that didn't entertain anyone. Considering his other movies, (Levinson) doesn't have a smart sense of humor (remember Envy, or Bandits?!). The man can't make pure comedies. Obviously he thinks too much, and when he wants us to smile, he chooses awful things ! (Robin Williams) made little effort to produce laughs. Most probably his talking scenes were something of his improvisation. Sure the have-not atmosphere with the movie's own confused personality made his role look like a trivial cameo among a sea of silly weirdness. (Joan Cusack) seemed scary let alone pointless. (Wright Penn) made a movie to regret it later (and if she wouldn't, THEN I WOULD FOR HER!). (Michael Gambon) isn't charismatic enough or droll enough to play that childish war maniac. Despite being the best of all, (LL. Cool. J) totally missed the funny touch of his character. Even the music didn't compensate, being another factor of bore. See, as a whole it is a new proof that there is something HUGLY wrong with the movies that are being written and directed by the same person !Save only few imaginative sets (Toys) earns its rank as one boring movie. I was wishing every minute to leave or change the channel. Too bad that I didn't have the luxury of pressing the fast-forward button!. The movie's intention, of the original tagline, that says Laughter this time is a state of mind didn't work. Simply the formula was unusual, yet surely uncorrected too. Accordingly that tagline seems eventually so pedant. In my viewpoints it failed at winning the kids, the eccentric kids, the grown-ups, the eccentric grown-ups; namely all. Unless good ol' Barry did it while having a turbid state of mind, or financial problems with it, then he must be an eccentric child and grown-up himself, delivering uninteresting toys for unbearable 2 hours. It succeeds only in being whether a black sneer at the foolish Hollywood Toys in general, or the worst satirical movie ever made. Damn. I can't forget the moment at the end in which the 2 war maniacs were saluting the toy soldiers; it's the top of this movie's naivety and poorness! Finally an advise  watch (Uncle Buckle-Up) instead. It's one of The A-Team's episodes, made 6 years earlier than (Toys), where the leads fought a gang by just toys. In comparison it's more meaningful. Otherwise; wait for a better remake !

When it debuted, it was admonished by critics and audiences alike, going belly up at the box office. Levinson's vision may have been more than two hours could handle. But, in hindsight, the movie's not bad. In fact, it's quite a joyous film about innocence that has a certain dreamlike quality that, alone, makes the film worthwhile.Levinson creates another world with Zevo Toys. It's clear when enter Zevo Toys that the film is in a world all by itself. Innocence is exemplified by the lack of war toys and the characteristics of Robin Williams' childlike persona. When his uncle comes to take his father's place, Levinson is demonstrating an attack on innocence and loss of childhood.This is the movie's triumph, as well as its fatal flaw. The visuals are stunning and do seem as though they're culled from childhood dreams. The characters' disposition is thrown off by unnecessarily including a suggestive love scene and having a very over the top ending that almost works, but seems more like an afterthought to finish up the film rather than a solid, inspired conclusion.Performances are top notch in this film. Robin Williams, always an eternal child, is an ideal pick for this film and is superb. Joan Cusack has a similar childlike persona and clearly has fun in her role, and LL Cool J somehow works, as the song of Williams' uncle in the film. The movie, like many labors of love, has many great moments, but fails in the story department and almost contradicts its message of innocence. What should have clearly been a great family film has trouble identifying its audience. These two ingredients keep an otherwise good film from being great.

At times, the movie does seem like it's trying to tweak at your emotions, but it's mostly pretty good.

I liked the idea of a military general striving to use lethal toys controlled by kids who don't know the real harm they're creating on the world. I liked the idea of child-like characters opposing him, but there wasn't enough of this throughout the film, especially in the second act. Leslie was too passive in his quest to discover what his uncle was up to. There are also plot points that don't develop as well as they should have (Alsatia being a robot, Gwen and Leslie's relationship to name a couple) and the ending is unsatisfactory as it presents questions that are not answered. Aside from the narrative, though, this is a really nice looking movie. The surrealist nature of the sets make for a nice treat for the eyes. There is one shot where the camera is shooting a room from a high angle. The camera then cranes out and reveals the room as a model room. The camera continues to reveal the real room, which is exactly like the model room. The colors used in the film really make it a joy to watch. Performances are a joy to watch too. Robin Williams and Robin Wright Penn have nice chemistry, especially in the scene when they're eating lunch. Joan Cusack's performance was really good. There are some reaction shots of her that really made me laugh. This film could've been really good, but the lack of development of the story and some of the characters and their goals make this film feeling like it needs more.

Don't try to look deeply at everything.Who can deny the magnificence of the doomed charge of the clockwork toys; the hilarious yet strangely moving speech by Williams before it; Cusack's wonderfully nutty yet tragic performance; Cuba Gooding's intelligent performance; Williams' brilliant ad libbing; the set design; the music; and many others?And if we really must look deeply at the screenplay, at the morals, how about the following two points*The question of Gooding's colour is never answered, not posed within the film itself. We pose it ourself, and it leads down interesting roads in the mind (I believe this whole issue was something noted by Levinstein in the pre-pro notes).*The acceptance we must grow up eventually, but the argument that we may still retain some of our innocence, some of our joy.

I don't know what it is about it, but I could watch it 1,000 times over and never get tired of it. The movie is so packed with spectacular images it almost overwhelms the senses at times. The movie also starts off strong with a 1st hour that is absolutely Oscar worthy, and then culminates in a 2nd half that seems to have no idea where it wants to go.The camera work, set design, costume design, and music are top notch. The images are sometimes a tad heavy handed, but usually they're subtle messages hidden inside of a large, pretense message (the dancing couple at the end of the big battle comes to mind). Unlike many movies, such as American Beauty and almost everything made in France, the symbolism never is so strong it detracts from the movie. It is in this delicate nature of many aspects of the script that the rumored 12 years of time invested into it shines through. The movie is definitely anti-war, but the final battle between the good toys and the bad toys doesn't make any sense. The message is lost as the good toys are used as weapons themselves. And as an example of simply bad film making, the build up to the final battle lacks urgency, and the characters just stay in the enclosed warehouse for very little reason. They could continue to run but they don't. This results in a battle where we don't care about the outcome. All we care about is the inevitable confrontation with the characters of General Zevo and Leslie Zevo. This is a confrontation that is incredibly disappointing since they both fall out of character to an extent in this scene.The acting is very solid all around. Joan Cusack lends a particularly inspired performance that I believe should have landed her an Oscar nom. Once the revelation about her comes at the end of the movie, and we look back over her performance, we begin to understand how perfectly she acted. Robin Williams begins to stretch his acting muscle, but in general Robin Williams plays&#133; Robin Williams. It's a good performance no doubt, but it's still just himself. Robin Wright (Penn) is good as the love interest, and she does a good job of being the new recruit who doesn't quite understand the way things work yet (the theme of her not being able to initially ride a bike isn't carried out as it should have been. It was a bad oversight in the script. You'll see what I mean). Michael Gambon does his best with a character that changes more than is believable. His character by the end of the movie falls apart and only begins to rebuild into a well written piece on par with the first part of the movie in the second to last scene.'Toys' is a movie with a very distinct message and seemingly no way to say it. It wants to say war is bad and innocence and whimsy is good, but it turns around and uses innocence and whimsy as a weapon. It has deep symbolism in many parts, and then has shallow symbolism that frequently contradicts what was said earlier. I love the movie. I do. Don't get me wrong. I think everyone should see it. Sadly, the movie is incomplete. It took 12 years for the movie to be half good. Maybe if Levinson had taken 24 it would have been all good, and possibly one of the greatest films ever made.

Gambon, a truly great actor from many other (but not enough in feature film) roles, mostly on British TV - The Singing Detective (1986) being one of the very greatest drama series and his performance one of the most compelling I have ever seen - in this film, he is very good, giving an appropriately (considering this is a family film) hammed-up performance, although if the script had been better and the audience it is looking for of a higher age range, then it could have been great. The role ain't bad at all really, and does have hints of greater subtlty beyond the effective caricature it is. I could see this film's subject being treated a bit more straight and with a more macabre tone, working very well. Gambon has a great scene with some old military buffer in a nursing tent near the start - this was genuinely hilarious. And so were a few one-liners and such like sprinkled sparsely throughout the rest of the film - examples being I'm a military man..., the bit where the General plays a video game, and the odd line from Joan Cusack. LL Cool J is okay, but hardly convincing in the later parts... Robin Williams was generally not particularly funny, and this hurt the film, as much of its effect is based on one being able to like the hero. He often came across as somewhat smug. Robin Wright truly was not needed in this film. Her presence wastes time and my good will towards the film. Truly her character is there just for the dads watching and to tell Williams how funny he supposedly is... The sets are very good, the music is in parts good, but, to reiterate another's good point, the good toys are odd-looking rather than glorious as they need to be to convince us of the worthwhile nature of the old ways of the factory, before Gen. Gambon takes over. Yes, and the enforced happiness of the workers there seems a little phony. It could have done with being a little more realistic in this way.  Similarly, the ending was rather too sentimental, and this didn't work in that I didn't believe the toys or the workers were genuine and they had no sense of reality about them. The last twenty minutes or so, with the battle that truly lacks any pathos, are clearly on action movie-modelled autopilot. It really does degenerate from a largely fun, mildly oddball family film into what could be any film in which the goodies win through implausibly in a battle of sorts.Certainly a very watchable movie, but one that could have been infinitely better if it had been either (1) a more dark, sinister film, or (2) a more genuine family film, without the phony tendencies, occasional slips in taste considering its audience (some brief sexual stuff - bizarrely involving Robin Williams...) and the cringe-worthy last twenty minutes.Rating- ** 1/2/*****  "},{"Title":"One of the best Fantasy movies ever.","Date":"28 July 2001","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama","Review":"  Barry Levinson's weird and wonderful fantasy comedy is a must see for anyone who wants to enjoy life to the full.

The colours and the effects combine to create a world of purity and wonder, a world I'd readily inhabit. Endless fields of tall grass, multicolour pastel-tiled bathrooms, and, of all things, pastel camouflage army uniforms, are a few of the many intelligent manifestations contributing to this world of wonder (a notable feat is the way in which the white-tiled fake vomit test room is reduced in volume in order to accommodate the needs of the General; this is probably one of the most brilliant things I've seen on film).Of course, the characters that inhabit this world are a different story. To its credit, a lot of the dialogue is intelligent and witty (especially when the General is involved, brilliantly portrayed by Michael Gambon; he tries as hard as he can to stay afloat in this mess). Joan Cusack was very well cast, and plays her part perfectly (or as well as can be expected, under the circumstances; the bathroom singing scene was annoying, but not unexpected of her character). LL Cool J, to his credit, is a very good actor, and survives, here, but barely; his presence creates this inexplicable......incongruence (the best way to describe it is that he doesn't clash with his surroundings, the surroundings clash with him; he is sort of above it all). The plot itself, has a great deal of potential, but wrong turns, not to mention the ending (Oh, God!), diminish whatever hope lay in this film's success; it is a satire, minus the 's' and 'a'. What does that leave us with, boys and girls?Then we have the two greatest catalysts, Robin Williams and Robin Wright. Williams' character seems to have no idea if he is juvenile, or straight, or serious, or funny; he seems to conform himself to the needs of the plot. Robin Wright is a little less shameful; superficially, she appears to be above the material, but her performance is in heavy contrast with her character, which is, in many respects, much dumber than she makes her appear to be. For one thing, her character didn't know how to ride a bicycle......Why? Another thing- anybody with half a brain, would walk away the minute they saw someone crouched in the corner of the bathroom singing (or attempting to sing) 'In the Still of the Night'. If I was in the public bathroom of a subway or bus terminal, and saw some nutbar do that, I'd walk away, or call an attendant, or something; I wouldn't join in, for goodness' sakes!And these are a few of the many things that make 'Toys' what it is.

Originally intended as the debut film of Barry Levinson's (Rain Man) career, it was put off until the early nineties. Despite his efforts, Levison ends up bungling what might have been a masterpiece in the hands of Tim Burton or Terry Gilliam (well, provided both were willing to take massive amounts of prozac).The film starts out swift and snappy but grows dull and plodding as it enters its final half an hour. Its simplistic moral message becomes evident the very second that Michael Gambon walks on screen to turn Robin Williams' beloved toy factory into a military plant. Robin Wright's irritatingly off-key performance as Williams' love interest only further rubs salt into the movie's wounds.Toys' amazing visuals and quriky one-liners save the movie from disaster. Every frame of the film is worthy of lingering on for several days. Joan Cusack and, suprisingly enough, LL Cool J are both fantastic in their nifty roles. But what finally makes the movie worth a look is its unique combination of both the bizzare and the bright. Unlike the adult fantasy films of Burton, Toys avoids dark humor and a cynical edge, making for a one of a kind, if flawed, movie experience.

Although the film did sort of fall apart during the evil toys vs not evil toys due to the lack of direction and not focusing on the editing.Hans Zimmer's score was also very impressive. It lifted the child-like atmosphere. Robin Williams was mis-used however, he did have some very funny lines (the Mother Teresa bit is worth watching for those few seconds) but his talents weren't used to the extent.Weird and wonderful, Toys is unlike anything I've ever seen, and i also think that underneath this child-like exterior is quite a serious metaphor.

I'm not 100 years old or anything but anyone who has a childhood memory of toys as things which made the world feel more magical and idealistic (rather than a tactical obstacle which must be reduced to non-sentient components in order to be conquered...), AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, for the kids that are just getting a sense of how our play determines the roles we play in reality, this film is so so so incredibly insightful, reverent and inspiring... perhaps even DANGEROUS. This is the film that dares to challenge how we play and begin our visualizations of what goals we should aim for, what points really represent and how the world's conflict resolution around us in the adult world is so often shaped by what we bring into it from our childhood.In the Christmas of 2005, after wandering through toy stores where kids beg their parents for the latest versions of Mortal Combat (or some equally violent and detailed phantasmagoria of killing and brutality), I went to my local movie store and felt an urge to watch this film. My boyfriend just finished a documentary on mercenaries and in the last year, I travelled to W.Africa to meet some of the humans of this world who had killed (or felt a duty to kill) during some of the ugliest uprisings in history... (the ones that have left teenagers with stumps instead of hands who, despite the general feeling of making peace after the atrocity, will forever be changed)... I wanted him to see this film, wanted to remember what it was about it that moved me to reconsider those absorbing fascinations we have with technology and toys that reduce our personal/physical/mental exertions to near 0.The film was not to be found for rent not only in one, but in the first FIVE stores I called. I'm not a conspiracy theorist (though I do have aspirations of becoming a secret agent) but I started wondering why this film would be removed from the shelves. This film was a brilliant and valiant effort (perhaps premature in a time when everyone considered war games kind of a machismo novelty and didn't think that hours and hours of mortal combat could desensitize a growing conscience)... a film makers bold call for humans (those of us in the kid position and those in the parenting position) to consider what we introduce and KEEP as valuable forms of play. A philosopher (sadly, I can't remember which one) pontificated that we learn to be a skier (for example) by pretending to know how to ski...that by going through the motions and doing our best to imitate and the movements of the act, we transform the pretense into the actual state of being. Play and games we play (and choose to keep when we're no longer kids) have SO much to do with how we evaluate situations, conflicts and resolutions... kind of makes you think about why there are suddenly so many guns in high schools. To be honest, I have to say that to a large degree this is about the parents; mine introduced the world of traveling to me as a way of showing me how to adventure and explore so that video games never entered my sphere of conscience until much later when I was able to look at them and consider not only how to WIN but what the points actually would mean in real life.I applaud Barry for this movie which now, so much later after he made it, resonates with visionary more so than ever.

There are moments of eccentricity to the extremity (especially the noise jacket scene) which gave my belly a work-out.MICHAEL GAMBON is at his hammyest as the villain with militaristic motives. He actually is quite humorous (think the video game scene) and quite disturbing. I read it as a comment on military generals from the point of view of a 6 year old boy (everything about this film is -toys-).JOAN CUSSACK proves that she can be weird as hell by barely moving a finger. She embodies the soul of the project.ROBIN WRIGHT is subtle (thank god!) compared to her co-stars and makes an interesting love interest.LL COOL J is the real hero of the film, and shows competence in creating a 3D character in a 2D world.~Set Design~ 1950's toys in a 1990's universe is the main instigator at play in this fairy tale. Possibly some repressed memories of Levinson's childhood. This will be the motif that divides the audience. Personally I give him kudos for being that risky. Most designs are played out as bad gags that fall flat, but alone they look marvelous, (I especially like the sketches General rejects !)~Costumes~ *For story purposes I never get why The General's costume switches from the normal uniform to the colourful one constantly. Maybe The General is remembering his childhood and constantly suppressing it. *Robin's costume are something you would see Williams wear everyday, no shock there, thumbs down for the soldiers black and red get-up. The stand-out would have to be Cussack's doll wig costume because its weird.~Music~ *Zimmer's score borders on African culture to begin with... it works. I don't know why. *The film seems to dance at times, really funky too. 90's Trance/Pop, I pity those workers who have to listen to Tori Amos all day long though, but they don't seem to mind.~Story~ The motives of the writers are very clear. Military toys are not cool. What else can I say. The theme drags on a bit though. When 'we get it' has been established, Levison seems to just let Williams take over and do his comedy schtick as the toy battle finale seems just thrown in and really below the standards of the rest of the film.

This movie is one of a kind. Picture a world where tall green grass grows over endless fields and hills, and where music and laughter fill the air like the sun. On a hill sits a giant statue of a toy elephant that blows bubbles from its trunk, and they flutter gracefully over the countryside. As you walk down the path-like roads of this landscape, you pass a doll-house that pops open like a pop-up book to greet its owners when they arrive. If this description does not interest you, then you're probably one of the people who rated this movie poorly. Only in 'Toys' and 'The Fifth Element' have I seen such whimsical atmospheres created so beautifully and imaginatively. Despite what people say, the story is very concrete, but it could only make sense in the world of 'Toys'. You have to be able to let go of this world and be taken in by the movie. It's full of memorable scenery, music, characters, and hilarious moments. It's also one of Robin William's best roles in my opinion. Where else could you see him in a smoking jacket that literally shoots out plumes of smoke and engulfs everyone around him? I will admit that the movie does lose a bit of steam toward the end, but certainly doesn't leave you unsatisfied. Definitely a cult film and a movie kids would love. Rent it if my description interests you; buy it and cherish it if you love it afterward. =) "},{"Title":"Wow.","Date":"31 May 2003","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama","Review":"  Any film with an opening sequence that, no matter how many times I've seen it, can still send my spine a-tinglin' is worthy of praise.

I loved it in theatres, and love it even more now. Dazzling performances from the leads (Robin Williams and Joan Cusack) give it such a child's innocence, and Michael Gambon is wonderful as a sympathetic villian, rather than a villian made to be booed and hissed at in a vaudevillian way. The sets are stunning lavish, the cinematography is among the best of that year, the costumes look as if someone designed them with crayons. All the eye candy aside, the story is a bit thin, especially the ending concerning the big robot monster, but it is a beautiful parable none the less. Amidst all the school shootings going on, and an America obsessed with violence, the movie's theme really rings true. Perhaps it was a bit ahead of it's time...

However, it was on TV one day, and having nothing better to do, I watched it. I found that it was an exceptional movie if you just looked beyond the slightly silly story. The movie's story is a parallel for what is happening in our society today. Our children's youthful innocence is being lost to violence, whether in video games or in reality. We have our protagonist (Robin Williams), a man who has never really grown up, and is still a child at heart. Our antagonist, a general who struggles to regain his former glory, with the innocence of children at stake. This is a movie worth seeing.

If that's a good thing or a bad thing is, of course, another question...Comedy favourite Robin Williams is Leslie Zevo, a mild-mannered, rather childish dude who designs, tests and plays with toys at his father's toy factory. Just like his dad, Leslie's a child at heart, devoted to bringing fun and happiness to everyone. But when his uncle (Michael Gambon), an army general, takes over Zevo Toys, Leslie's whimsical, wonderful world changes overnight. Soon the General and his commando son (LL Cool J) are building weapons which will be controlled by an army of arcade-trained youngsters. And they've turned the carefree toymakers into regimented robots. No Leslie, with the help of his sister (Joan Cusack) and his new girlfriend (Robin Wright), must find a way to save the company --- and grow up without losing his playful spirit!Robin Williams does a fine job, as he always does,(most recently in the chilling One Hour Photo). Michael Gambon stands above the rest of the rather dull cast as Leslie's mad uncle. The rest of the team just seems to sit back while this world is being filmed around them; they never quite manage to enter the surreal setting of the film.I watched this particular film when I was very young, and I must admit I absolutely loved it. But now that I see it again when I'm quite a bit older, I've started to notice the serious flaws and overall lack of...of...Something! I can't put my finger on it, but there seems to be something...someone...awkard, strange about Toys.And that's really the point Not everyone is going to be able to get past the goofy visuals and awkward music that plagues Toys. It's a rather odd movie, I'm afraid to say. It tries to blend grown-up themes (of love, sex and war) with truly childish visuals. The color palette of the factory consists of bright blues, reds and yellows; the planning of the factory and the construction of the toys is, now that I look at it, completely goofy and totally nuts; and, finally, the story is a bit, shall we say...Awkward.And that seems to be the word of the day, people awkward.And nuts.So there you have it, folks. Some will absolutely adore this film, some will dislike it immensely. I guess you just have to watch the film and see for yourself. I've got to go take a break from writing, man...This film is just so...so damn wierd!

That's the best way to put it. It's a movie I have seen many times over again and admitting this very fact is something that always raises my friends' eyebrows. The set design, imagination, casting and overall heart put into this movie is what makes it come alive. Levinson puts us in an alternate reality that still oddly links back to our own with its satirical themes and occasional line gags. (Come on, we've all done it comes to mind). Toys is a movie I saw at a very young age so it's always had a place in my heart. When I first came here and saw how it had such a low score and so many negative comments reciting how the movie is boring, appaling, the biggest cinematic debacle of our time, etc. etc. I was, to put mildly, stunned. If you haven't seen this movie, I ask you as an audience to give it a chance. Maybe Toys will find its way into your heart as well.

It's a movie about a Toy factory, it's funny.. and it looks a little deeper into the weird and wacky world we are raising our children in.I find it to be entertaining on many levels. First there is the slapstick sight gags (the smoking jacket), than the 'come on, we've all done it' line (watch it to find out what I'm talking about) which, like many others is an adult joke that doesn't rule out kids finding it funny too.So if you like good music (closing of the year, is in my opinion all all time classic), laughs and something to take you back to your youth than I suggest this movie. 8/10.

The set design is fantastic, the score intriguing, and the performances WAY out there (the meet-cute dialogue scene between Williams and Wright is enough to make your flesh crawl). The prolonged war-toy battle ending does drag on but it is fascinating in its ineptitude- WHAT was Barry Levinson thinking? There's no way this segment was storyboarded. Anyone interested in film technique - what works and what doesn't - owes it to themselves to view this film at least once. A MAJOR guilty pleasure. "}]
