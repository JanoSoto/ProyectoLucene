[{"Title":"The Forgotten Disney Film","Date":"6 February 2004","Score":"40 out of 40 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Family, Adventure","Review":"  In what may be the most remarkable live action film to come out of the Disney studios during the 80's or even the 70's for that matter, I find the treatment it has received from it's own studio appalling.  The best thing I can compare it to is having a ruby but discarding it because you only prefer diamonds.  Considering all the costume jewelry Disney released in the aforementioned decades, you would think they would have more respect for this gem.I'm sure parents who took their children to see Natty Gann when it was released were surprised and shocked to discover that it was not a film for younger children.  It is a very dark realistic film which takes place during the Great Depression.  This is not only the story of a young girl traveling across country to find her father, it is the story of people searching for hope and trying to survive in an age when just having food on the table was a constant struggle.  When Natty's father Sol(Ray Wise) is offered a job in a logging camp in Washington, he is only given a few hours to come to a decision, either take the job and leave Natty behind, or stay in Chicago with Natty and hopefully find work elsewhere.  At first, rejecting the job offer, he steps out into the Chicago streets.  In a truly remarkable scene, we see as Sol does, the faces of all those who have lost hope and been beaten down in despair.  It is after this brief but telling moment that he realizes, as we do, there is no decision to be made and Sol accepts the work in Seattle. Sol is forced to leave Natty in the care of a boarding house owner Connie(Lainie Kazan). After Natty overhears Connie reporting her as an abandoned child, she decides not to wait for her father to send for her, and begins an arduous journey across country to find him.If ever there was a film that is a picture of contrasts it's this one.  Early in the film we are given the harsh reality of depression era Chicago.  Director Jeremy Kagan does not spare us from the details.  We watch as men stand hopelessly and helplessly praying and hoping for work.  There is a scene where a destitute family are evicted from their home.  Later, as Sol is heading to Washington in the bus, we see another family on the road with their meager belongings strapped to their car as they head west, their car no longer operable.  As Natty walks through the market place vendors sell what meager belongings they have just to get buy.  When Natty runs away we see her fishing for food out of a trash can for a morsel to consume.  Later, as Natty travels westward, there is beautifully photographed scenery of forests and mountains, but Director Kagan astutely reminds us of the bleakness of the depression with many scenes of the struggle in rural America, ranging from a scene of a farmer and his much pregnant wife plowing a field, to scenes of orphaned and abandoned children left to be wards of the state.   This is not your Daddy's Disney, kids.  Dick Bush's cinematography of the wilderness is breathtaking, yet in the scenes set in Chicago and in the farm towns of America, he mutes his colors to enhance the contrast between beauty and desperation.  When Natty jumps her first train, she is help and befriended by Harry(John Cusack), who is also riding the rails.  Cusack in his first major dramatic role after being extremely good in The Sure Thing, shows for the first time that he is not just a comedic actor, but has dramatic prowess as well.  Harry may be young, but Cusack gives him the edge of a man aged beyond his years.  It is an uncanny performance.Salenger, as Natty, is more than just a teenage actress. Her characterization draws us into the story from the first moments of this film to the last.  It is the key that holds this film together and if it had been put into less capable hands the film would surely not have succeeded as well.  Although her film career since Natty Gann has not been noteworthy, you will always remember her for her unflinching portrayal of Natty Gann.  This is a journey for the ages, and one you will not soon forget.  Unfortunately.......I don't make it a habit to comment on the DVD release of films, but in this case I'll make an exception.  The transfer of this wonderful film is appalling.  It's bad enough when a film that shouts wide screen is only released in a very horrid poorly done pan and scan, but the full screen transfer is one of the worst if not the worst I have ever seen.  It gives new meaning to the word grainy.  At times the picture jitters so that you may begin reaching for your VCR remote to adjust the tracking until you remember this is a DVD.  There are signs of the film's age running rampant throughout and no visible effort to clean it up digitally or otherwise.  I'm not one to believe every film should come with a boatload of extras, and have no problem if a studio wants to give us just the film, but there is absolutely no excuse for the poor picture quality of this DVD.  This movie is a gem, and for the Disney studios to tarnish it and treat it in this unconscionable manner, saddens me terribly.  What is more frustrating is the fact that Disney can do quality video releases, so just a decent film to DVD wide screen transfer would not have been a lot to ask for.  They should be ashamed of what they have done to this fine fine film.My Grade Journey of Natty Gann-ADVD transfer - F              "},{"Title":"Meredith Salenger will break your heart","Date":"8 February 2003","Score":"24 out of 25 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Family, Adventure","Review":"  This haunting and delightful film - intended for children but equally compelling for adults - tells the story of Natty Gann, a brave and resourceful young girl who traipses across Depression-era America to find her only relative, her long-lost dad.  If that sounds depressing then think again.  This is a gem of a film.  It has Meredith Salenger in the lead role displaying a warmth and maturity to carry a role that may easily have overwhelmed a less gifted actress.  How on earth she hasn't become a big star is completely beyond me.  Offering commendable support is John Cusack as the older boy and drifter she befriends on her journey.  Children's films so often tend to lean towards sentiment or easy endings but this uncompromising film, and yes, the language gets a little colourful at times but so what, has a depth to it that makes you root for the heroine to the very end.  Natty Gann is simply a wonderful film for young and old alike.

One of the earlier reviews was talking about how all of the bad things that happen to Natty are inappropriate for a disney movie, but I think that those are the things that make this film so great. It is a gritty, realistic, non sugar coated story. The things that are shown to happen to Natty happen every day and have been for many many years. They bring drama and heart to the film, and make it what it is. Combine the latter with unbelievable cinematography of America, very good performances, and you are left with a very memorable, timeless film.

Part of the reason why was that Disney made a poor decision by releasing this movie in pan and scan on DVD. After several failed attempts to convince Disney to release a widescreen version, I gave up and purchased a region-free DVD player and then purchased the region 2 version which was in widescreen.All I can say was, it was worth it. Journey of Natty Gann is a wonderful movie and is perhaps one of Disney's best. The cast features Meredith Salenger, John Cusack, Ray Wise and Scatman Crothers who all put in terrific performances (special mention also goes out to Jed the dog who plays Natty's wolf companion). This movies also boasts some incredible outdoor photography and a memorable music score by James Horner.The story is about a twelve year old girl named Natty (Meredith Salenger) who travels across 1930's America in search of her father. Along the way she has several adventures and meets up with another runaway named Harry (John Cusack).I definitely recommend seeing this one.

NATTY GANN is a rather unknown Disney release from 1985 that takes places in the '30's. Natty Gann is a young girl living with just her father in a bleak time. She is rough around the edges and has clearly built up a crocodile skin due to the life she has led. However, at her core, she truly loves her father.So when he is forced to leave her at a moment's notice to travel to Washington (the only place he can find work) Natty is left in the care of a bitter Landlord. It doesn't take long for Natty, played by Meredith Salenger, to runaway in an attempt to travel the 2,000 miles to be with her father again.On her journey, Natty meets all kinds of people who are suffering due to the nation's economic situation. One thing she witnesses is a dogfight where one of the dog's is a rather wild wolf. Natty reaches out for the wolf though and eventually manages to establish a bond with the wild animal. Together, they continue to travel towards her Washington State in pursuit of Natty's father.As the plot description above makes clear, the framework of this film is not horribly unique or important. However, what does give the film some extra quality is the approach in which the material is taken on.This film is very much in the same vein as another under-appreciatted Disney classic, RETURN TO OZ. This is a very dark family film that lacks all of the standard, corny Disney clichés (aside from the animal friend, but here he doesn't talk... and he isn't particularly nice at first).THE JOURNEY OF NATTY GANN portrays the depression-era and it's effects on the poor very honestly. We see Natty eating out of garbage pales and sleeping in filth. We see the type of work her father is forced to take on. And we see the bitterness and resentment Natty feels towards her situation.She is not your typical hopelessly-optimistic Disney heroine. She gets angry, she defends herself, and she doesn't make excuses. She starts fight, even smokes what appears to be weed in the opening scene (this was something I certainly didn't notice as a child). However, the role of Natty is always grounded by an appealing and fully realized performance from the young Meredith Salenger. She hasn't found much success in film following this movie, but it is definitely one of the best child performances of the 80's.Now aside from the good qualities of the film, THE JOURNEY OF NATTY GANN moves a little too slow for me to really love it. Despite the many Disney clichés it avoids, it's still always obvious Natty will find her father and all will be happy. So the fact that it takes 105 minutes to do so is a bit much. And there is a supporting role / love interest played by John Cusack who is essentially useless to the plot.But Disney deserves some credit for boldly taking family films to a darker, more artistically developed place in 1985 (both RETURN TO OZ and NATTY GANN were released in that year). There haven't been children's films that really embrace the darker side of things like these 2 films do since '85... and these under-viewed films deserve a little more credit and public acknowledgment for looking outside of the lines in a genre that is too often trapped within the lines....

I enjoyed it because there are few movies in which there is a female lead character who is a tomboy, and I could easily relate to this character, being a tomboy and seeking adventure myself.This film is about Natty, a girl during the Great Depression, who is separated from her father. She runs away from her guardian to try to find her father and finds compassion in an captive wolf in a similar situation. During her travels, she meets many new people, including a love interest, and puts herself into danger. She's always on the run in her attempt to get to her father.This film is a good family historical film, and it is packed full of adventure and danger. It has some good messages behind it, and it is easy to see the similarities in the two lead outcasts wolf and girl. It's a great film because it has a female lead character who is a tomboy.

The scenery is breathtaking, you kinda think I wish I could go back to then & live in that incredible world. The music is perfect, nudging & reinforcing without interrupting or annoying. This is also one of Scatman Caruthers' last roles, doing what he does best; adding a touch of autheniticty that makes our suspension of disbelief effortless. The DVD is a horiffic slap in the face to the theatrical release, the cast, crew & it's *SO* bad it makes the movie look shoddy.

The love story between Natty and Harry is so romantic, and the independent spirit of a young girl was rare in movies back then and is still rare now. This is an overlooked film that has always filled me with that feeling of secret magic, that there can be movies and stories like this, and that a young girl can make it on her own.

Like To Kill a Mockingbird and Matinee, it uses a child's eyes to focus on surrounding events. In this case it's the Great Depression witnessed by a tough but kind-hearted girl venturing from Chicago to Seattle in search of her father. Even though this is a Disney movie, there are some intense scenes showing what the authorities did to people. Watching the movie, it's easy to get the feeling that almost no one has any street smarts anymore Natty does some pretty gutsy things in the course of the movie.I recommend The Journey of Natty Gann. While not the grittiest movie ever made, it shows the lengths to which a person will go out of love. As for the wolf, Natty has an easier time relating to him than to many humans. And beyond that, we get some great shots of the British Columbia wilderness (where the movie got filmed). It's the right balance of fun and seriousness.As for the cast. I mentioned John Cusack. The star is Meredith Salenger, who also appeared in 1982's Annie. Also starring are Ray Wise (the henchman in RoboCop), Lainie Kazan (the mom in My Big Fat Greek Wedding), Scatman Crothers (Halloran in The Shining), Verna Bloom (Mrs. Wormer in Animal House) and an early appearance of Grant Heslov (the photographer in The Birdcage and later the producer of Argo).

During her journey she has an extended encounter with a wolf and several scenes with John Cusack in one of first acting gigs in film. Natty Gann takes elements from Never Cry Wolf (1983) a drama focused on a scientist studying wolves in their natural environment, The Incredible Journey that focused on the long trek of three animals trying to find their where back home, and the strength of female character found in the likes of Where the Lilies Bloom (1974). Similar movies were later made using similar themes such as the journey of an animated cartoon superdog in Bolt (2008), a girl's belief in caring for some baby geese in Fly Away Home (1996), an orphan girl in The Secret Garden (1993), a girl's search for a mysterious animal in The Secret of Roan Inish (1995), a girl attempts to ride a whale, something only boys in her culture are allowed to do Whale Rider (2002), a girl who goes looking for her lost father in Winter's Bone (2010) Perhaps the strongest girl movies have been The Lovely Bones (2009) of a deceased girl searching to mystery surrounding her own murder, the animation feature film Spirited Away (2001) of a Japanese girl who enters a fantasy world in a long epic adventure, and in this case a boy who goes on a journey surrounding a mysterious key in the aftermath of 9/11 in Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (2011). However Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975) in which an adolescent girl along with a few of her friends go on a haunting adventure on a rock formation in the Australian outback is the best. Natty Gann is significant is powerful in its respect of wildlife and the straight forward never over the top nature of this journey, not quite of the same captivating intensity as Stand By Me (1986) about three boys who go looking for a dead body release a year after Natty Gann.

The attention to detail is staggering, I mean the sets were superb and the costumes were lovely. The music is haunting and pleasant and the script is well above average. There is also enough action to satisfy kids and adults, and the film is effective especially in conveying the harsh realities of children living in the depression. The performances were also astounding. Meredith Salenger was absolutely fantastic in the title role, completely believable and even heart-rending, I am lost for words at how she hasn't gone on to be a major star, for her performance showed that she really could act, which could more than be said for some of the actresses working today. John Cusack is also impressive as the drifter who tries to convince Natty that the open road is no place for a young girl. The wolf featured here is very cute too, and Ray Wise is great.

The wilderness shots are inspiring, the story is exciting and full of adventure and freedom and the music is exquisite! I'm am unbelievably furious the soundtrack is unavailable!!!! Meredith Salenger is captivating as Natty, an undaunted tomboy who runs away (from an unbearable landlady) cross-country to find her dad, who is logging in the wilderness of Washington State! Set during the Great Depression, she rides the rails and scrounges for food. Along the way she becomes comrades with a beautiful wolf, who protects & aids her, and meets up with a young, savvy hobo, played by John Cusack. She finds plenty of adventure, as her father, who was forced to leave her under the landlady's care until he had the money for her passage,  is devastated that she has run away and possibly been crushed by a train. I love this movie with all my heart, so I hope you will watch it and then write the record companies DEMANDING a SOUNDTRACK be released!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

But I do remember liking it, and it's probably worth a re-watch for those who saw it back in the day, and a first watch for those who've never seen it.It's notable for featuring a very young John Cusack, before anyone knew who he was. It seems to me that Disney had a pretty good track record of live action films during that decade (Never Cry Wolf is another forgotten one) but that few of them have had any staying power.Grade B+ "},{"Title":"If you have not already, buy the video","Date":"31 January 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Family, Adventure","Review":"  A group of very talented and caring professionals got together to produce this beautifully told story; highlighted by a very captivating performance by Meredith Salenger.

It's the writing that kills it dead. Firstly, the method they use to show the daughter as being independent-minded is her smoking with two boys in a bathroom stall. This really only shows her to be self-destructive, and actually kind of dependent on peer pressure. Also. . . kids smoking in a Disney movie? The man with the mouse would not approve.Secondly, both the father and daughter in the movie are a pair of bona fide s@#$s. The father decides it's perfectly alright to leave his brainless, self-destructive daughter with a self-obsessed landlady who (no surprise here) kicks her out as he skips merrily off to the other side of the country. Oh, and this is after he spends the day looking for her because apparently he in no way keeps tabs on his pre-teen daughter in downtown Depression Era Chicago. This is someone for whom we're supposed to feel empathy and/or admiration?When the daughter, Natty, sets out on her own, she abandons a dog she adopted a couple scenes before. Like careless father like careless daughter? Then she lets a large, snarling, blood-soaked dog escape loose into a town after it wins a dog fight. I was actually almost glad when a random guy slapped her for doing it. I wanted to slap her myself at that point. The dog predictably shows up snarling and barking at her in the next scene, but sadly it doesn't end the film then and there by mauling her to death as a lesson to viewers not to release trained weapon-dogs into the world. Eventually, Natty avoids starving by the sheer luck that the dog brings her food and basically decides to adopt her.After the next part, wherein the dog guides her to an a-hole farmer and his pregnant wife - followed by the obvious upcoming implication that the dog would get blamed for an attack on the farmer's chickens - I just couldn't stand to watch anymore. The stupidity and endless pettiness of the writing became overwhelming.Oh and, by the way, girls from that era (even inner city girls) didn't swear that freely.All this said, the art direction and costuming is excellent. The cinematography is good, too. What a waste.

If you want to watch a good old fashioned boy with dog , or in this case girl with wolf, film, then you could do no better than this. Made in 1985, it could easily have been made 20 years earlier. I don't suppose older children would appreciate a film like this now, but if you are under 8 or over 40, then tuck into this wholesome feast. I gave it a 9, not because of any brilliance in the script, but because it is a perfect example of its type. Don't expect any surprises. Meredith Salinger is so good as the young runaway, however, that it set me wondering what she would have done with better material.

In his version, most of the story was the same, with the difference that the girl who dressed as a boy and rode the boxcars in the 1930s was running away from her father, not to him.I have read the original script my father pitched to Disney and it is virtually the same, just less Disney (no dog, for example).If you check out the screenwriter, Jeanne Rosenberg, you will see she specializes in sequels and adaptations. This was NOT her original work, and I challenge her to claim it was (I have nothing against her - I am confident she was simply given the basic plot and told to write the screenplay, and accuse her of nothing that could be construed as unethical).It was my father's great misfortune to have had this happen in the days when no L.A. lawyer in his/her right mind would sue the Walt Disney Corporation. That has since changed, but 25 years ago it was universally understood that taking Disney to court was an exercise in futility.Check my father out on IMDb Bert Brown. He's a legitimate producer, not some crackpot with a grudge, and has no idea I am posting this message. I hope someone can put me in touch with Jeanne Rosenberg or the development exec. who headed up this film in order to set the record straight.email evanebrown@gmail.com "},{"Title":"No Fan of Pan and Scan","Date":"29 December 2002","Score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Family, Adventure","Review":"  I have been somewhat upset at various releases that have met the fate of being put out in pan and scan, which is to say that the sides have been surgically amputated.  This has been done with Fly Away Home, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (both now restored), Timecop, George of the Jungle, Fearless, 84 Charing Cross Road, White Fang and a couple others I cannot recall.  The explanation by the studios came as follows a large volume of sales is from Walmart and most of Walmart's customers do not understand what widescreen is.  Instead, they want to know why the top and bottom of the picture is missing.  I suppose they also want to know what happened to the ti-ti-ti record sound when the play CDs.  It all boils down to marketing vs. art and apparently there is no money in art.Part of the charm of the Journey of Natty Gann is its scenery.  Thanks to Walmart, I guess, we are left with a myopic view.  To quote Raymond Babbit in Rain Man, K-Mart, we should go to K-Mart.  Have to get to K-Mart. 400 Oak Street.  Have to get to K-Mart.

The fact that the Disney company tried to pigeon-hole this film as a family offering disturbs me, for I find very little in the way of family entertainment here. We see Natty alternately being punched, ripped off, verbally abused, wrongfully incarcerated in a juvenile home, and nearly assaulted by a child molestor who gives her a ride(her trusty pet wolf leaps through the rear windshield of the truck to save her), not exactly the kind of things you want your 7-year old to see. There's also a prevalent attitude of hostility and bitterness that permeates the attitudes of nearly all of the people Natty encounters. This can be attributed to the circumstances of the depression economy, to be sure, but the sheer amount of this vitriol makes the film a bitter pill. Lainie Kazan, as the shrewish, middle-aged propriotress of a boarding house who agrees to watch Natty while her father is away is the prime example. John Cusack appears as one of the few sympathetic characters and Natty's ill-conceived love interest. Some may find this film acceptable, but I found it brittle and dark. Toss it on the scrap heap of Disney live action films with TRON and CONDOR MAN.

It's not a comedy (like Patch Adams), but it's not too emotional either (like Free Willy).  Meredith Salenger was a great actress as Natty Gann.  One scene that made me puzzled was where Natty got off a train and walked by a group of people who were betting on a doberman and a wolf who were fighting.  Of course, since the wolf was much bigger, he won.  Now this is what puzzles me Disney censors their animated shorts, yet they don't censor this.  I mean this is much worse than scenes in the shorts that feature smoking, drinking, violence, racial stereotypes, etc. put together.  At least the violence in the shorts is supposed to be funny.  This is cruel violence, especially for animal lovers (of course the director of the film didn't really have the doberman killed).  Well, I guess Disney is just weird.  Natty runs into all sorts of adventures on her journey from Chicago to Washington state.  She comes to a farmhouse to get food.  I thought the farmer was a real jerk.  He had a real attitude problem (e.g. he says A wolf, a wolf ain't nobody's friend.) His wife was pretty nice though.  Another person who was a real jerk like the farmer (only much worse) was the woman who worked at the reform school that Natty got sent to after being accused of helping a gang steal a bull. She locked her in a closet.  She then escapes and eventually finds her father.
