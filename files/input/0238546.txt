These are not Anne Rice's vampires. Every character is different, despite their names (The only one to nail a character was Vincent Perez, the highlight of the movie as Marius. Good job.) 2. The plot of the movie is not based on the books. It as if someone picked up a copy of The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned, opened to random pages, made assumptions, got bored and stopped reading, then wrote a screenplay.3. The vampiric rules adhered to in the books are not followed in the movie. The vampires just do whatever is coolest. A certain vampire can't fly? Why not? And why not give him a trail?Once you have acknowledged all these things, you can watch the movie. Have fun. This is not heavy stuff like Interview with the Vampire. Watch Stuart Townsend dance around in a mesh shirt and tight pants, and applaud when his shirt disappears, or, if you like it better, watch Aaliyah gyrate in a scanty metal bra contraption. It's what these two do best. Embrace its plot holes and stupid dialog (which lends itself to random quoting), sing along to the entertaining rock songs. Try and figure out what each of the ancients are named. Pride yourself if you can provide any explanation for what happens at the end of the movie, because trimming to help the pace leaves the ending fairly incomprehensible, especially to those who have read the books.Be sure to watch the extra features, the gag reel for laughs and the deleted scenes if you want to know what happened in the movie. Also try the various documentaries, which are entertaining when they throw in weird special effects while people are speaking.Perfect for a loud, popcorn-filled Friday night with the friends!Prindora (Eibzesii) "},{"Title":"As a stand alone vampire flick, it's worth seeing.","Date":"17 September 2002","Score":"70 out of 105 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  Combining The Vampire Lestat and the Queen of the Damned novels into one screenplay was, ahem, damned to suffer massive story cuts because of the intricate and detailed background of a dozen or so characters involved. The amount of detail always was the strength of the Vampire Chronicles, in my opinion, and they were certainly worth the read.That said, the question remains, without the detail and extra characters, can the basic story of Lestat's re-awakening of the Queen of all vampires be entertaining and sufficient enough to sustain itself?  While I can not answer the question with a glowing appraisal, I will certainly admit that it did a decent job of combining all of the basic elements into a stand alone movie.  The fact that this movie can stand on it's own without any ties to the prequel, Interview with the Vampire, is one of it's assets.  You do not need any fore-knowledge of the characters, books, or prequel movie in order to watch this.Even though it fits into it's own little package does not mean it was packed very well.  There were some plot holes, some of which could have been filled by simply restoring the Ancients scenes that were on the dvd.  I understand, as the dvd points out, that they were left out because it introduced another subplot and characters that would add unnecessary confusion.  While I agree with their reasoning, I do think they should have somehow salvaged the scene so that while the introductions of the ancients would have been left out, Maharet's few lines about Akasha's reign of destruction and the vampire's responsibility should have remained.  They would have added a needed sense of urgency and motivation that would have made the final confrontation with Akasha and the ancients a bit more reasonable and satisfying.The character of Jessie is supposed to be the human link for the viewer to empathize through as they are taken into the world of vampires.  In some scenes, this works adequately, but on the whole, Jessie's motivations, while they are explained, seem kind of empty.  I am not sure if I can fault the actress or script, but when the movie was over, I still felt ambivalent about the character's experiences.There were other elements that were not as fleshed out as they could be. The paranormal Talamasca needed a bit more background about their vampire tracking as did the character of Maharet and her family tree.  Like Jessie, they were given some explanation, but I think a couple more lines of dialogue would have helped.As I mentioned, the movie did a decent job of the basic story, but massive changes were made from the source material.  Characters were dropped completely, or merged together, and huge sections of character history were removed.  Most notably, Lestat's history is extremely compacted and revised. Nonetheless, there are some things that remained that I thought were done pretty well.  The character of Lestat in this picture is rebellious and reckless which is more true to the character than he was portrayed in Interview.  Lestat's re-awakening and concert scenes were exactly like I had envisioned when I originally read the book.  The character of Akasha was also as I pictured and a very good casting choice.If you are a fan of the books, and you need the twins, Gabriel, Magnus, and crew, you are going to have difficulty sitting through this.  If, on the other hand, you can set that aside and view this as a vampire movie of it's own, unrelated to the chronicles, you will probably enjoy this for the stand-alone vampire flick that it is.In summary, worth the rental.

Any reader of the Vampire Chronicles knows what I mean.  They changed so much of the story that they will be unable to make any of the other books into movies without changing them completely also or remaking this one.They totally trivalized the debate between Akasha and her 'children'.Marius (who did not make Lestat btw) in the chronicles is the great reasoner of the Vampires.  In the book he had a long argument for Akasha.  In the movie all he says to her is Akasha, please.  He was never jealous of Lestat drinking from Akasha (he himself had many many times) and didn't try to hide Enkil and Akasha from Lestat. They turned the Vampires from sad and beautiful creatures of the night who only kill the evil-doer into blood hungry wanna-bes who eat whatever mortal wanders by. Maharet's twin, Mekare, isn't even in the story.  Mekare crawling out of the jungles after thousands of years, insane and single minded, to fufill the curse she spoke to Akasha in her court in ancient times was a major plot point. Anyway, my point is that a very well thought-out and seductive story was turned into a joke of a movie.  Honestly, don't bother seeing the movie, read the book.

One, Anne Rice (author of the book) offered to write the screen play but was refused by the studio. Two, they tried to stuff 2 in depth novels in to a 2hour movie.I maintain the only way for these two books -Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned- to work in a live action form would be through a mini-series. First off the the Vampire Lestat alone takes place from the 1700's to the 1980's and has a plethora of character vital to the plot understanding of the main character, Lestat. The entire book Vampire Lestat sets up the events of the second part Queen of the Damned. Without that full understanding the premise of a movie is destroyed.Lestat was not cruel and vicious to all, he was not wanting to go along with Akasha's plans, Marius did not make Lestat, Lestat did not love Jesse or make her, Lestat could not go remain unscathed by the light, Marius was not after David nor the other way around, every character was completely represented wrong, BASICALLY same names different story.If they wanted to make a vampire movie, fine. Even if you wanted to be inspired by these novels, fine. But don't piggie back into the theaters off the success of Rice's great novels and characters just to destroy what her loyal readers have come to love.If you haven't read the books you won't understand the film really, if you have read the books you will be insulted. That being said, I am such a huge fan I had to see the movie knowing full well this was going to be the case and still went for it. Catch 22, must see it, will hate it.

I couldn't have predicted that years after it's release just thinking about the movie still makes me angry. The novels are amazing, and while I understand much gets lost in the translation to screen, this movie was a great big middle finger to her original work. I hope one day someone tries again, the right way, starting with The Vampire Lestat. They change the roles and looks of major and minor characters alike for no good reason. They destroy Lestat's history. The acting of the Queen is exaggerated to the point of comedy, but I just can't bring myself to laugh. The charm and allure of the novels just isn't there. The movie is a bad excuse to cram as many musicians and dark imagery as possible into one movie, hoping the teeny Goths of America would lap it up. Part of the appeal of the first movie, of Louis' story, is that he is caught between his humanity and his curse. Lestat is supposed to take over and display the magic and excitement of the vampire world. Thank goodness I read the books first, or I'd have never touched them after this movie.

Her body movement and beauty was captured exceptionally well.  It's also nice to see that a black girl was chosen for the role of an Egyptian Queen (No, I'm not predjudice against white people, I am one).  True it's not known what color the ancient Egyptians really were but this was a nice change.  Stuart Townsend completely made me forget about Tom Cruise's portrayel of Lestat and Marguerite was striking once again.  All in all it was a good time at the movies.

A veritable consortium of the undead in a contemporary setting, `Queen of the Damned,' directed by Michael Rymer, is a story of shadows and darkness, and of the unfortunate souls who dwell therein for eternity.	The vampire Lestat (Stuart Townsend), bored with a world that no longer excites him, has been `asleep' for many years; but suddenly, the sounds of that world he hears from his extended slumber change, and liking what he hears, he ventures forth to investigate.  What he finds is a world filled with new sounds, a new kind of music-- driving and penetrating-- sounds that assault the senses and make him feel alive and welcome.  And he knows that at long last his time has come, that it is time for him and those like him to come out into the open and face the world on their terms.  Toward that end he becomes the front man for a band-- a singer and performer unlike any the world has ever known.  He presents himself as a vampire, and very quickly amasses a following that extends far beyond London (where it all begins), and will ultimately take him to Death Valley, California, where he plans to give a concert that promises to be beyond anything anyone has ever seen or experienced.	Lestat is powerful, without question, but there are those of his kind who do not take favorably to the fact that he has revealed them, one of whom is Marius (Vincent Perez), a vampire powerful in his own right-- the vampire, in fact, who `made' Lestat so many years before-- and they are gathering, coming together and making their plans to meet Lestat at the concert.  And they are not going for the music.  But there is something else, as well  At one point Lestat has inadvertently awakened the `Mother' of them all, the most powerful of all the vampires, Akasha (Aaliyah), who is about to make her presence known to all, and especially to the one she has chosen to rule by her side as her King  Lestat.  And at the concert, rest assured, Akasha will be in attendance, without fail.	Make no mistake, this is Lestat's story, and Rymer presents it amid a setting rich with atmosphere and with some exquisite moments, though his film has less bite to it than say, `Interview With the Vampire,' or `Bram Stoker's Dracula.'  He sets a good pace, and there are some scenes that provide some real thrills, but overall the film isn't as soaked in menace as it could be, or as much as one might expect.  In the final tally, in fact, the amount of flesh that is incinerated wins out over actual blood-letting, though there is more than a taste of gore, and more than a fair share of lips and mouths dripping with the red stuff.  There's some good F/X on hand, too, especially in the sequences that accentuate the speed of the vampires, as they move and hurtle through the air faster than the naked eye can discern.  It's a decent job by Rymer, but he could have put more teeth into it had he played up the alienation hinted at by Lestat; as it is, you get a sense of his detachment, but not enough to get you totally involved.	In `Interview With the Vampire,' Tom Cruise brought some charismatic star power to the role of Lestat, but Townsend is even more effective, with a look and an attitude that captures Lestat perfectly.  He plays him with a sense of acceptance, and under closer scrutiny you may even find a hint of remorse and longing.  It's a good performance, and one that sells his character convincingly.	As Marius, Vincent Perez does a nice job, too-- he is, in fact, one of the strengths of the film-- though his character is a bit ambiguous; that, however, has more to do with the way he was written than with Perez's performance, which is quite good.  	Turning in noteworthy performances, as well, are Marguerite Moreau, as Jesse, a young woman too curious for her own good; and the gorgeous Lena Olin as Maharet, Jesse's Aunt, who ultimately plays a pivotal role in the outcome of the drama involving Lestat and Akasha.	And as Akasha, Aaliyah is an absolutely riveting presence.  What more can one say about her other than she is a gifted performer, with tremendous talent and beauty.  And, tragically, she has left us much too soon.	The supporting cast includes Paul McGann (David), Christian Manon (Mael), Claudia Black (Pandora), Bruce Spence (Khayman), Matthew Newton (Armand), Tiriel Mora (Roger) and Megan Dorman (Maudy).  With a much stronger story than the usual offerings of this particular genre, Anne Rice fans, especially, will be pleased with `Queen of the Damned,' a film nicely crafted and delivered by director Rymer and his engaging cast.  By focusing attention on the drama of the story-- and the way it's presented-- rather than concentrating on merely providing some cheap thrills, Rymer has succeeded in turning out a true horror film that is definitely a cut above, and one that just may whet your appetite for more of the same.  And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 7/10.  	  		      "},{"Title":"It had potential. Oh it had potential!","Date":"8 October 2006","Score":"12 out of 15 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" This movie was horrendous, and is definitely not worth your time, nor money. I must admit, this movie had potential, but in the end some major factors made this movie rot.First of all, aside from probably the names of the character, this movie respected nothing of Anne Rice's enthralling book. Oh yes I know,to those who haven't read the book it doesn't matter much. But you see,it does because those who haven't read it are deprived of the depth of the characters, and their powerful inter-relations with each other and the whole 'human' aspect of the book. All of which made the book so appealing. The whole point of the book! Some characters were excluded from the movies, characters that carry import to the plot, such as Mekare, Maharet's twin and the sorrowful Legend of the Twins, Armand, Daniel, and Louis and Gabrielle, both Lestat's fledglings and lovers. Akasha had a whole maddened plan to bring peace on Earth. You see, Akasha isn't evil. She is simply single-minded and selfish, lost in her own reasoning. So many characters had so much to offer. And the movie failed to deliver that, which made the characters utterly one-dimensional, and not ones the audience can relate to. It stripped so much of the book, which saddens me, because believe me the book was wonderful. I find some scenes were completely irrelevant, and that they could have been replaced with some decent book-respecting ones. There were a considerable amount of factual errors.Second of all, the acting and faulty accents was enough to make me want to cringe.Also, the movie was too fast-paced. I know, I know, a movie cannot last eight hours to fully capture the profoundness of a character or action, but honestly! The whole Jesse/Lestat love affair could have blossomed if only they had some decent dialog and a little more time! It was like everything had to be hurried. A two-minute scene with Jesse and boom! He has a soft spot for her. Give me a break. Make it believable at least!By the way, Lestat's singing was horrible. He sounded tone-deaf.So I leave you with one advice go to the library, loan the book and read it. Well I would advice you to start from the first tome (Interview with the Vampire). It is such a worthwhile experience to discover Anne Rice's awing piece of literature.

He may not have the blond hair and blue eyes that are so vividly described in the book, but to be fair, he would not look good with blond hair, and Lestat is most definitely about looking good. He moves like the predator I always imagined Lestat would have. The visual effects are pretty good, and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing. It's not Interview with the Vampire, so don't try to compare the two. Interview is Louis' story. This is a cut and paste version of Lestat's. In any case, I highly recommend.

I'm blessed with a gift to appreciate them, I guess. And I'm also blessed with the ability to take movies as totally separate from their book counterparts. Die hard Ann Rice fans might not like this movie because it slams two books (The Vampire Lestat and The Queen of the Damned) into one to make a relatively short film. So, obviously, a lot of the story was changed or left out. Which makes it understandable why some were upset. I mean, come on, Interview With the Vampire was over two hours long, and it was the movie version of just one book.However, taken as it's own story, the movie is actually very good. Well, in my opinion. Stuart Townsend's portrayal of Lestat is wonderful. And it doesn't hurt that he takes off his shirt quite a bit (he has a really nice, defined, if lean, body) and wears leather pants quite a bit. He also has the rock star quality that is often missing when most actors play musicians. You can see how into the music he is. He also is able to project Lestat's arrogance and loneliness very well.Vincent Perez, who plays Marius, also does a wonderful job. Though quite popular in Europe, he is sadly under-appreciated in the U.S. I can't honestly say that his portrayal was dead on (so to speak) because I haven't read any of the books the character appears in, but I thought he was quite good. (Another one that is good-looking, ladies.)Akasha, unfortunately, displays very few emotions, so Aaliyah didn't get a chance to really showcase her acting talents in her final performance, but she did play the evil vampire convincingly. Since she was said to be quite pleasant in real life, I'd say her performance was excellent.Most of the remaining cast were also enjoyable, if not impressive in their performances.There are also interesting special effects.I loved this movie.If nothing else, you should at least check out the soundtrack. The songs are well penned and preformed by a number of talented musicians. My advice? At least give this movie a chance. Despite the bad reviews, you may find yourself pleasantly surprised.

But that's all that's good about this film. From a purely film point of view there are a bunch of under-developed characters, plot holes, and it just doesn't make a whole lot of sense. It's not really surprising, since the director (Michael Rymer) has done nothing but 'B' movies, as have the two writers (Scott Abbott and Michael Petroni). I'm truly surprised that Anne Rice supposedly liked this film. If the screenplay had followed the book in any real way, the film would have been EPIC. No matter what the producers say on the official website, it could have been done right, as with The Vampire Lestat, if they had found the right writers and had actually wanted to work at it. But they were more interested in making a money maker, and so ended up with a movie on the threshold of 'B' movie, with a story that makes no sense, and actors that are only so-so. And some may say that the effects are cool, but I say they could have been a hell of a lot better. Especially given the fact that the film was made in 2002.Now here are my biggest pet peeves about the movie 1. MAHARET IS A TWIN! In the book she has an identical twin sister, Mekare, and they can both see and speak to ghosts. This is a very important fact as to how Akasha is made into a vampire. The Story of the Twins in the book would have translated fantastically into the movie. They are also very important as to how Akasha is killed. Both of them kill her, not just Maharet. And Maharet does not turn into a statue afterwards. She just goes on living.2. AKASHA IS NOT African! Don't get me wrong, Aaliyah was very beautiful, was a good singer, and may have become a wonderful actress, but Anne Rice's Akasha was not African. Despite what the producers on the official site say is historical accuracy, it is not. Akasha was a princess from the historic city-state of Uruk, located in what is now Iraq. THIS is historical fact. Akasha would have looked Middle-eastern. Her husband, Enkil (who was sadly under-represented in the movie compared to the book), may have been African, since he himself was from Kemet (very ancient Egypt before it was known as Egypt). But Akasha was not. And I don't understand how in the movie Akasha and Maharet knew each other in the movie, since it is never explained. In the book, they meet in the ancient times, when they are both mortal, along with Maharet's twin sister, Mekare, Enkil, and Khayman, who was Enkil's steward. (Khayman was another destroyed character in the movie. He is also an important part to the creation of vampires.) 3. MARIUS DID NOT CREATE LESTAT! It was a vampire called Magnus, who kidnapped Lestat when he was a young man living in Paris. (This is in The Vampire Lestat.) Magnus then burns himself to death after creating Lestat, leaving Lestat on his own, with no idea what is going on. (Which is why Lestat says what he does in the movie version of Interview with the Vampire.) Marius does play an important role in Lestat's life, and IS the keeper of Akasha and Enkil, but he is not Lestat's maker.4. JESSE IS NOT A 'COOL, HIP' TWENTY-SOMETHING THAT IS MADE INTO A VAMPIRE BY LESTAT! Yes, she is made into a vampire, but by a vampire called Mael, who lives with Maharet. Yes, she is a member of the Talamasca, because she can see ghosts like Maharet, but she is in her thirties, not twenties. Also, she is a direct descendant of Maharet and Khayman through about thirty generations. Confused? Well, in the movie, Maharet mentions something about the Great Family. Some may have interpreted that to mean the whole human family. Not so. In the book, the Great Family are the descendants of a child that Maharet had right before becoming a vampire, whose father was Khayman. Maharet protects ALL of them, which is why Jesse ends up with her at times when she is a child. Another cool fact about Jesse from the book She goes to New Orleans and sees the ghost of Claudia from Interview with the Vampire.5. AKASHA DOES NOT GO AROUND JUST KILLING ALL KINDS OF HUMANS. Yes, she does kill a lot of people, (and just about every vampire), but the humans she kills are MEN. And she doesn't kill them just for their blood. In the book, Akasha, while sitting on her throne like a statue, has come to believe that she is some type of goddess, and wants to rid the world of vampires (who can try to destroy her again as they tried to in the vampire wars of the ancient world), and of men, so that she can rule a peaceful society of women. She believes that all of the worlds problems will be solved that way. She takes Lestat to be her lover, and together they rid a couple of islands of all but a few men (for breeding purposes).I have a bunch more pet peeves, but I'm running out of room. All in all, if you like the movie, fine. But do not assume that the movie is based on the book in anyway other than title, and the characters names. The actual book by Anne Rice is sooooo much better, and I highly recommend anyone who has seen the movie to read the book. With the book you will NOT be disappointed. (And for those who may have tried to read Interview with the Vampire after seeing the movie, and found it tedious, all the other Vampire Chronicles are a lot more entertaining.

I was expecting something along the lines of what they had done with the first movie, however, that was not the case. In fact, it seems to me, with this movie they did everything they could to distance themselves from the first.  The script for this movie was nothing but trash.  Some of the lines were so cheesy I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  The acting wasn't the best it could have been and a lot of the scenes were so awkward that I laughed at loud.  It didn't flow very well, and I'm not sure that someone who hadn't read the books would be able to identify the characters or have any idea of what was happening.  Though, I went with a good friend of mine who is also a big fan of the books, and even he had trouble trying to figure out who was supposed to be who because the characters we so drastically different from what they were supposed to look like.  They kept introducing new characters (which most they didn't even bother to name) before they had even developed the existing characters. They moved so fast that you weren't even really sure who you were supposed to side with.  I would advise hard core Anne Rice fans to stay away from the movie because it will only upset you.  Anyone who was going to see it because it was a sequel to Interview With the Vampire should avoid it because it was nothing like the first one.  Anyone going to see it because it's a new vampire movie shouldn't waste their time because it was more cheesy then the sequel to From Dusk Till Dawn. I really wouldn't advise anyone to see this movie at all.  There is no need to waste your money on nonsense like this.  I'm just afraid that people will think this is what the books were like.

First of all it's based on half the story (the book before it in the series The Vampire Lestat ended with the beginning of Queen of the Damned) They left out main characters, omitted the histories, and even changed how Lestat became a vampire, what was left out of Interview With The Vampire felt like they just needed to fit into some time constraints, what they did with Queen of the Damned was a hack and slash job. Even taking it separately from the book, it was at best mediocre. The characters were two dimensional, and bland, and the plot was boring and unconnected.

Lestat did not go to sleep in the 18th or 19th century and when he did he was still horribly wounded from being repeatedly stabbed, having his throat cut, being set on fire, and being thrown from a large tower. As I am a fan of the books this flick annoyed me so much I started shouting at the TV. As far as I know Lestat wasn't a fan of the goth genre. He was supposed to have risen in the 80s and was a ROCK star... not goth, not metal, not rap, but ROCK star, proper 80s rock. He wore denim and huge 80s sunglasses, rode a Harley Davison or a Porsche, which sadly got totalled but thats another story (that SHOULD have been in this movie). Thats the least of the flaws. As many here have stated, many characters and about 90% of the story and background has been cut out and probably sh*t on by the B-movie hacks responsible for this tripe. Even those characters that were wedged into the background were just nameless, funny looking freaks - i had to look up these people on the internet to find out who they were. The character of Armand looked more like Marius was supposed to look than the actual Marius character himself. AND, since when did Akasha have a semi Russian accent and an African heritage? The concert scene in the books was much more interesting than the awful spectacle in the movie. It was a nice touch that in a giant arena Lestat didn't need a microphone because of his powerful vampiric voice. Jesse was supposed to be severely injured at the concert too, having her spine smashed and it was Mael (the freaky old scarecrow guy in the movie) who turned her. Don't even get me started on the P!SS poor ending of this overzealous mtv ad because that was just a load of crapola!I'm gonna stop now because thinking about it is just angering up the blood.

Though not a massive Anne Rice fan, I enjoyed both The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned and thought I would enjoy the film.I was wrong.I think possibly I would have enjoyed the film much more if I hadn't read the books. The vast majority of the plot has been left out due to time restraints on a contract or something like that, so there is no legend of the twins, and Lestat's actual maker Magnus is not mentioned at all. But none of this annoyed me as much as the fact I spent the whole film patiently waiting for my two favourite characters to show up, those being Louis and Armand. Louis didn't appear at all for some good awful reason, and although I was told Armand made a brief cameo appearance I didn't work out who he was until after I'd seen the film. Daniel was also left out completely, and Pandora, Khayman and Mael were cut down big-time. Marius' character was butchered. Now, I've only read the books twice in the past 3 years, so I fail to see how I managed to see what gaping holes these emissions left in the plot line and the writers didn't. I just didn't get Jesse and Lestat. In the context of the film, yea, it sorta made sense, but to anyone who read the book it was just weird, to be honest. Stuart Townsend did a good job as Lestat, and although I do think Tom Cruise was better, you can't really take the fact that Townsend is GODLIKE in the looks department away from himThough I am giving this film 1/10, I can maybe, POSSIBLY see why someone who hadn't read the books might enjoy it to some extent.

This was questioned by many fans of the Anne Rice novels and was answered by the explanation of the Producers are making one movie and did quite frankly one of the best damn jobs possible. The sexy bravado of both Aaliyah and Stuart Townsend mix as they form a great on-screen vampire duo. Fans of Interview With the Vampire won't be left missing the same actors as the new cast adds a better feel for the ethnic backgrounds of all the vampires. Also, the character of Lestat must be thought about for a second or two. In Interview, Lestat was shown as he was in the eyes of Louis. In Queen, Lestat is how he is in his own point of view, these are two different images with some likenesses but many major differences.Queen of the Damned showcases great acting, a great sense of atmosphere, a kick-ass soundtrack, and an all around vampire feel.

I don't want to give anything away, but lets just say a lot of bloodsuckers fry.  The reason this movie, especially this scene is so beautiful is that it makes you feel like Aaliyah is alive.  That is also why this scene is so haunting.  You know she's dead.  And she's just incredibly beautiful.  But then again that stupid cult chic (Jesse just incase u don't know who I'm talking about) gets in the way and ruins Akasha's plans to rule with Lestat at her side.

The voices were great and for people who said there wasn't enough of the vampire queen in the movie... well Aaliyah died before the editing was done so forgive them for that!To end the movie in my opinion was an A+.

I was definitely NOT disappointed and I don't think anyone else into vampire  movies will be either. I absolutely think this movie did complete justice to the sentiment of the author and her characters. First of all The sets of the movie were beautifully done. The backdrops, the props, all of it.

This was something that could've potentially been a disaster for the films makers had they not been both believable and very very good. They were more than believable and more than good.. I foresee the soundtrack being a big seller with me at the front of the line. The vampires were beautiful and terrifying as was my impression when I read the book. I thought the depth and scope of the companions relationships were underplayed but was very happy it was note entirely overlooked Ie, Marius and Lestat, Marius and Dave Upon leaving the theater the only semi fault I could find when speculating on how this fabulous film could have possibly been any better was the relationship between Lestat and Jessie was not explored enough to jive with the ending. I felt like there was a little skip in the record there. Why would Lestat care so much? etc... The movie surely could've done with another hour to develop the intensity and length of all of the relationships between Lestat and Marius, Jessie and Lestat, Marius and Dave, Marius and Akasha, and Lestat and Akasha, and so on. As a Lestat fan I certainly would sit through any length film with Lestat...

I did not see anything wrong with his accent I actually enjoyed his part the most in the whole movie. He captures Lestat and his wayward ways perfectly, and his skin looks beautiful in the movie. The concert scene was very well done and the song System playing along, while Akasha killed the vampires, was a nice touch. The little Jesse was adorable and the grownup was also compelling. Marguerite Moreau pulls off her part with a lot of flair and innocence, she's probably the only innocent in the whole movie. Akasha was physically enchanting though it was hard to make out the dialogue especially when she and Lestat were on the beach. Even though her role is not overly large she  holds your attention when she is on screen. I enjoyed the scene when Lestat crawl away from the groupies and then crawls up the wall, very nice. Also when Lestat is listening to music lying in his coffin and then he realizes another vampire is in his mansion that is also very for lack of a better word, yummy ). The ancients who were barely featured seemed very reserved and not enough lines for them all, if they had any. I counted only about three lines from Armand, and Matthew Newton did resemble a pretty girl as my friend interjected. I think he was a pretty good Armand in appearance, he did not speak enough to find out if his character was very complex and dark, like it is. I like that Lestat calls his band my children, very paternal and sweet of him, if Lestat can ever be sweet ) Also his biting sarcasm and humor worked well for the movie especially the line Sorry I'm late, I was trying to catch my breakfast. And when Maudy (a band member) first saw Lestat and was surprised about his statement that he was a vampire Maudy-Vampire, that's funny. and Lestat's reply Yes, it's hilarious. Some of the special effects were a little shoddy and I'm not sure why but the way that the preternatural speed was conveyed was a little funny looking. Overall the movie deserves recognition for all the hard work put into it by everyone. I don't think it's fair to judge it so poorly especially because of the fact that it wasn't what you expected.

Usually, when adapting a book into a movie the screenwriter usually cuts parts to make it fit into a time slot. In this case, they cut out so much and added things that never really happened. For goodness sakes, Mael was older than the man who played David and David is supposed to be in his 60s during this time. They completely cut out Louis, Gabrielle, Mekare and the entire story of how the Vampires came to be. Then the characters of Pandora, Armand, Mael and Khayman were merely extras and only showed up at the very end. They never even speak their names. And Pandora is a Roman woman, not Indian. Khayman was young when made a vampire, not an elderly man. Marius did NOT make Lestat and he should've been typed out of the role. Finally, Lestat. There is almost nothing right about Lestat.

It might give some parts of the film away..... This was by far one of the worst adaptations of a novel to a movie I have ever seen.  The only thing that the film had going for it was the sound. They did a great job doing sound effects.  Other than that, everything abouut the movie was just wrong.  The plot was incredibly shallow.  The movements of the vampires were wrong.  Vampires move faster than the eye can see, which would mean that you would not see trails.  Every vampire in the film could fly.  I seem to remember that in the book, Lestat couldn't even fly until after he drank the blood of Akasha.  So there is no way that the other vampires would be able to.  Another MAJOR flaw in the film is that Lestat says that Marius was his maker.  COMPLETELY WRONG!!!!!!   In The Vampire Lestat, he clearly tells us that Magnus made him a vampire without any choice, and then jumped into a fire and killed himself.  The movie also left out the legend of the twins.  Maharet is not the one that kills Akasha, her sister did.  To go even further, they didn't kill her by sucking all the blood out of her.  They killed her by cutting off her head, then Maharet ate Akasha's brain, and her sister ate the heart.  She then became Queen of the Damned.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that the next time Hollywood attempts to make a film out one of Anne Rice's books, they should probably at least read the book first.  That way, they might get the facts right.

So tired of hiding underneath the shadows, he was quickly engulfed with his new discovery he joins the goth band Satan's Night Out and before we know it in a flash--- he has the music industry and legions of fans attention. Part of his mystery is he kept people guessing if he was a real vampire about to catch his breakfast. Enter Jesse(Marguerite Moreau ) a Talamasca member, her job is to research on all things out of ordinary, you guessed it right she gets to know about vampires! She stumbles across Lestat's old journal which gave us a background about his 'life' or whatever you want to call an undead's life. Instantly Jesse has this little school girl obsession towards him. They meet, have a connection.Meanwhile,we come to learn about Lestat's fascination of the Those Who Must be Kept the very first vampires and that is Akasha(Aaliyah) and Enkil who are hidden in Marius'(Vincet Perez)chamber as statues sleeping. We later learn Lestat drank from the Queen the night he played his violin for her. Marius his teacher and maker warns him about the danger of the Queen. Back to modern day,Lestat has a Death Valley Concert and Oh no! Akasha has awakened! Lestat joins her and gets to do the vampire nasty. Now this beautiful evil lures Lestat to become her lover and partner in her wrath to destroy. Will Lestat turn his back on her now?The film is not something to be taken seriously, I don't think that was the intention. It's a fun vampire rock movie, no more,no less. It's flashy, fast paced,funny,vibrant and violent, at times scary. It completely butchered the book. First of all,Queen Of The Damned and Vampire Lestat combination already sounded awry, it's completely hard to adapt that part of the chronicles. The vampire history was completely scrapped in the movie, which disappointed me.  I do see why though, it will turn out to be so long-winded and that's like a whole movie by itself. Lestat is basically the focal point here and the filmmakers basically had a new spin on his story. I believe if they did take themselves seriously as a page by page adaptation for a film, I don't think it might work quite as well.The acting was decent, my favorite would be Vincent Perez's Marius though odd looking as a short haired, pale and thin lips, he surprisingly caught the essence of the character. Lena Olin was a great Maharet what the hell she's great in everything. Stuart Townsend though he got the evil, mischievous, sexy and androgynous side of Lestat, he's no Tom Cruise.  I literally squirm at the sound of his horrible accent, he would've been good but that accent really irks me. He should've been mute all through out,aaah! The nightmares I will have. Marguerite Moreau (Jesse) suffers with such a boring and lousy chracter with hardly any depth, at times how I wanted Akasha to drink her all up or do that heart stunt to her. Poor girl, she did what she could do, I can't blame her she can only do so much to a bland character. I must disagree though about the comment given about Aaliyah's acting, coming from someone who was never a fan and am never familiar with her work both as a singer and an actress, I thought she played Akasha very well indeed. Sensual,arrogant and totally intimidating and screwed up as hell. Sure, she's a mediocre villain but that bar scene made me want to clap as she walks over the fires with this serpentine movements,so alluring. As a sophomore film effort, she was great.About the soundtrack Jon Davis and Richard Gibbs did an amazing job integating the nu-metal influence in this vampire flick, although I thought it was a bit overdone, I would have wanted more of the violin score from time to time. Maybe because I'm not a big fan of hardcore metal/rap music anyway.Overall, take a bite it's an entertaining ride. You're right this is no 'Interview'...I don't think it wants to be.

However, it appears that the present day interests him enough to awake and forge a career as a rock star. He has become highly successful and openly admits he is a Vampire to the press, although nobody seems to actually believe him. He lives off the blood of female groupies that his Manager Roger (Tiriel Mora) picks up and brings him. A woman named Jesse (Marguerite Moreau) who works for 'Talamasca Center for Paranormal Studies, London', listens to some of Lestat's lyrics and is convinced that he is a real Vampire because he talks of a pub called the 'Admiral Arms' and various other silly things. Jesse's friend and colleague David Talbot (Paul McGann) says that the organisation knows of Lestat and are already onto him. David gives Jesse Lestat's journal to read which chronicles Lestat's life, how he was turned into a Vampire by Marius De Romanus (Vincent Perez) and how he first came across the Queen of all Vampires, Akasha (Aaliyah) who was at the time some sort of weird statue. Jesse becomes obsessed with Lestat and heads to the 'Admiral Arms' in which she finds acts of Vampirism taking place. There she meets Lestat who lets her live. Lestat heads back to Los Angeles to prepare for a sell-out concert. Jesse follows him. It appears that most Vampires dislike Lestat for his high public profile, which is drawing unwanted attention to all Vampires and not just himself, and they want him dead. While in Los Angeles Lestat is contacted by Marius who he hasn't seen in nearly 200 years, he begins to fall for Jesse when they meet again and Akasha makes an appearance as she plans to wipe out the human race and rule the Earth with Lestat by her side as King and Queen! All this while trying to prepare for a big concert too! Will the Vampires successfully assassinate Lestat? Will Akasha wipe out the entire human race? Will Lestat turn Jesse into a Vampire and condemn her to eternal life as a blood-sucking Vampire? Who cares? Directed by Micheal Rymer I hated this film. This film isn't horror as far as I'm concerned. It's as much horror as a music video. The script by Scott Abbott and Micheal Petroni based on the Novels 'The Vampire Chronicles' by Anne Rice is an absolute mess. It tries to have various story lines going but forgets about them during the film, it also fails to juggle the various sub-plots so that I cared about or even remembered them. The flash back to Lestat's early years is almost redundant, Akasha's plan to take over the world isn't even mentioned until the last half an hour or so, Jesse at first is trying to track Lestat down as part of her job but that is also quickly ditched as she becomes the love interest, Lestat as a rock star is only really focused on during two scenes, there's a scene where Lestat and Akasha fly to an island and well, I'm not really sure as it's so choppy as to be almost incoherent and generally speaking there just isn't a single focused story going on. There is a typical Hollywood 'happy ending' that almost made me sick. It's really slow and boring too. There's no blood, gore, violence or Vampire action except a ripped out heart a bloodless decapitation and a couple of Vampire fights with awful CGI effects that are simply embarrassing to watch. Having said that I did like the way Akasha died, but it only lasts for about a minute so doesn't compensate for the lack of any decent horror throughout the rest of the film. The acting is poor and no one looks particularly interested, Aaliyah stands out as being as rotten and miscast as anyone else and she looks like she should still be in school! It's quite well made but for a film with a budget this big that's the least I expect. Just to round this terrible film of and add insult to injury is the soundtrack which features mind numbingly bad rock tracks throughout. I hate this film.

This has to count in its favour when you compare it to other recent robotic exercises in camp such as the horrid 'Tomb Raider.'The other good thing about 'Queen' is the casting.

Being a fan of Ms. Rice's novels, my first thought was how can they do Queen Of The Damned without doing Vampire Lestat first?Having finally seen the movie, now I can see how they did it.  If you have read these books, imagine taking out the gory parts from Vampire Lestat, cramming Marcus and Marius into one character, and removing everything to do with Lestat's beginning (the wolf hunt, his violin playing, the Theatre Of The Vampires, and also Louis, Claudia, and Gabrielle), then in the last 15 minutes cramming in Queen Of The Damned.What we loose is a very important piece of Lestat's character.  His inner agony of having to kill to live, the fact that he carefully tries to select killers as his victims, and his love-hate relationship with Louis, Armand, Gabrielle, and all the other vampires.Also important to the story is that we loose the Story Of The Twins, which is the Genesis of Ms. Rice's vampires.  And while I am sure the cannibalism was to intense for showing on the screen, they could have done something closer, and showed us more of ancient Egypt.Even worse, we have this love interest thrown in between Jessie and Lestat.  The Vampire Chronicles is basically an American Yoni story.  For those that do not know, Yoni is another form of Hentai (Japanese Porn Comics).  But in Yoni, it is about gay male relationships, told by a female.  While I am sure many men object to the gayness of the characters, in this movie they went to the far extreme the opposite way.  For instead of Lestat persueing killers, he goes after young female groupies.And the other flaws in logic and storyline are vast.  At the beginning Lestat emerges from a century long sleep, then later on asks Marius how he made it through the 1950's in red velvet.  Marius has no idea who Elvis is, and says he slept through that period.  Makes you wonder how Lestat knows about 50's fashion and music, since he slept through the same time period himself.  And nothing is ever even mentioned about Louis, Claudia, or Gabrielle.  I think that is a huge shame.  Is like seeing Snow White and the 3 Dwarfs.Overall, the movie I thought was really bad.  About the only good thing about it was the soundtrack.  Most of the acting was poor, the accents drove me up the wall, and all of the really in-depth parts of the book were removed, leaving us only with a hollow shell, kind of like Enkil after he was sucked dry.If you want to see a good modern vampire movie, get Lost Boys, the original Interview With A Vampire, or even some old episodes of Dark Shadows.  Let this one Rest In Piece, with a stake through the heart, cloves of garlic around the neck, and a vial of Holy Water in the mouth.In ending, remember that before Aaliyah was killed, this was intended to go straight to video, no theatrical release was planned.  It is obvious now why this was.  It is only sad that somebody as talented as she will be remembered for this dog of a movie, instead of something where she really might have shined.I rate this a 2 on a scale of 1-10.

I know in this day and age throwing a successful musician in a movie lead puts butts in the seats but..uh.......I dont believe they banked on Aaliyah doing such a suck job. Why else would one of the main characters have 15-20 mins. in the film!(She was alive when the movie was finished,so I dont want to hear that excuse!)It just doesnt make sense. I do believe that Aaliyah was a great dancer and mediocre singer with a sexiness and style which was just what the doctor ordered in R&B. On the other hand,as far as acting goes.....she was out of her element!! The accent was horrible...(and even if that wasnt her voice in the movie, it was her voice in the gag reel) she didnt at all convince me that she was an ancient queen of all vampires that caused massive terror in her day. She was pretty enough and sexy enough but they should have gave that role to a seasoned veteraness!! The role seriously lacked.Sorry to say but Aaliyah took away from the film in my opinion and she wasnt one of the fortunate singers who could cross-over into acting. And I think they realized the same and thats why they were going to send this film straight to video.They basically capitalized off of her death and fooled her fans as well. She has about four small scenes at the end of the movie!*****SPOILER I think******** *****                ********The dying scene was the worst job of dying i've ever seen!  The way she looked at her hands and turned into stone was shocking absurb.  The way she jumped on the scene at Lestat's concert was asinine. She looked like a love goddess instead of a deadly vamp. Even when she ripped the heart out in the bar and sunk her teeth into it.....it came off like she was sipping tea in England.  And when she crushed the heart...with her over exaggerated acting....she did everthing but stop and yell out look im an evil queen and im crushing a heart!!!*******end of spoiler************The truth of the matter is, Queen of the Damned would have been an alright movie if a.we saw the queen more b.a lil' more goreSo if your not picky and you just want to see Aaliyah's last perfomance I would recommend it but if your looking for an interesting horror flick...dont look here!

Luckily my university had a free sneak preview last night.  I read the book and knew beforehand the movie did not follow the book very closely (as basically none of the character's physical features were kept true to the book).  If I had paid to see this movie, I would want my money back.  This has to be one of the worst adaptations I have ever seen.For those who have not read the book and/or are not Anne Rice fans if you really want to see it, don't expect much from the script or from Aaliyah's acting.  The story seems very shallow and skips around without really giving any character or situation any depth.  The movie has a bright spot with songs from Jonathan Davis of Korn, Godhead, Deftones, and more.For those Anne Rice fans Do not see this movie unless you want to walk away mad and with your head shaking.  The fact that they changed so much from the book is astounding.  Let me give you some examples.  Lestat has brown hair and eyes.  Maharet does not have red hair, but luckily Jesse does.  There is no Legend of the Twins, and there are no twins- just Maharet.  The origin of the vampires is not told or even hinted at.  Louis, Gabriel, and Daniel are omitted from the movie.  Marius makes Lestat and teaches him all about being a vampire (but in Interview, weren't we told Lestat learned nothing from his maker?  Hum.) Marius is never trapped in ice.  Jesse longs to become a vampire and it is Lestat who turns her into one, she is never injured.  Armand has a minute of screen time, in which he is a blond haired fop.  When Akasha massacred, they were men and women.  There is no female liberation is this movie.  David Talbot is young.  Akasha kills Pandora by making her burst into flames. Akasha dies when Lestat, Armand, Maharet suck her dry and because Maharet got the last drop, she is now stone.In addition to all this, the opening credits and first 10 minutes or so are pure cheese.  The theater was laughing at its corniness.  Other scenes seem silly, though they were not intended to be this way.  Lestat lacks the fire and cockiness that Tom Cruise's character possessed.  Every character is a very watered down version of what they should be.  It was also just so lovely to hear Aaliyah speak every word with a Dracula accent.Basically, if you are going to spend any money on Queen of the Damned, spend it on the soundtrack, not this butchered, Hollywood version of a great book.

Interview with the vampire was a wonderful movie and I think Tom Cruise did a wonderful performance in that one. Unfortunately when I heard that Aaliyah was cast as Akasha I knew something had gone terribly wrong. First of all Anne Rice should have written the script (like she did for IWTV). The Vampire chronicles are very popular and the film company wouldn't have had any problems getting famous actors in the leading parts. I think Catherine Zeta Jones could have been wonderful as Akasha, Jude Law as Lestat, Lena Olin was great as Maharet and Ralph Fiennes as Marius.With a great director this movie could have easily been as great as IWTV but Warner Brothers were so cheap and did not care s### about this movie so they hire this nobody from Australia to direct and cast a couple of Australian actors in supporting parts. Claudia Black was alright as Pandora but the Australian actor who played Armand was totally wrong for the part.Stuart Townsend was a disaster, I don't understand where they found him cause he looked like he was acting in a totally different movie. Aaliyah (God rest her soul) was a beautiful and talented singer but her acting abilities were limited and that is clearly shown in this picture. (Her accent is awful in this movie).The screen writers, producers and director is to blame for this mess and that they dedicated this movie to the memory of Aaliyah was a disgrace. She will be remembered for her wonderful music and not for this huge disappointment.I don't understand why Anne Rice haven't gone out stating how the movie company totally ruined this movie. She was angry that Tom Cruise played Lestat but at least he did a good job in a wonderful movie but this movie should have given her a heart attack cause they haven't been true to her books.They only good things about the movie is the Music (Jonathan Davis rules), the Score written by Jonathan and Richard Gibbs and Lena Olin's performance, the rest is crap!!!Stay away from this one!!!!

If my memory serves me right the friggin story is supposed to take place somewhere around 1985. Oh well, i guess it could be worse, right? Right, and it gets worse.Every character, for some reason, has opposite personalities when compared to the book. Not to mention looks. The only character that even resembles the descriptions in the book is Maharet.And on top of that the whole storyline has not only been altered but been completely changed. About the first five minutes is all good, except for the visual flaws, then it all turns to crap when suddenly the start meddling with everything. I can understand that all the scenes and material won't fit in 90 minutes but there is no excuse for changing as much they have done here.

I love both and both touched me, though Queen of the Damned took some time to do so, it did not when I saw it in the cinema first. It did as I rerented it for some reason I am still not really sure of, maybe because I love everything that is connected to Vampires and if I do not find a movie to watch I like to return to watching one of those I already know... and this one I had not seen as often as the others, well - now I have it in my collection and it is one of the most stressed DVDs.To the plot Vampire Lestat is not the usual kind of Vampire. Supposed to seek the night he yearns for being among the living, cannot understand why he as one of the powerful kind has to hide and be lonesome as seems to be his fate. So one day he lays down to take a time out of a hundred years and awakes in the London of the present. He sees it fit to finally do as he always pleased, he joins a punk band playing in the ruins of his old house (or rather makes them join him)and with the help of his Vampiric charisma then turns famous, groupies yearning to be bitten by him not really aware what that means... but that is not enough to him, he openly states to be Vampire, breaking the rules of his kind, telling of their secrets in his songs and challenging the other of his kind. Those are afraid of a world aware of them and seek out to kill him. Lestat is not alone though, there is an organisation dedicated to observe the Vampires and among those there is a female apprentice who slowly succumbs the aura of Lestat. And there is the ominous queen of the Vampires, Akasha, who once ruled the earth with terror, living a life in the open, who one day with her King went to a sleep over the millennia as they were simply bored with their life. Sensing in Lestat the same yearning to be out in the open she is awaking and looking for her new king after she killed her old mate asleep. Lestat finds himself between two women, the Vampire Queen that was born Vampire, has incredible powers and offers him his share of those on her side, seeming to offer all he always wanted and the feeble and soft woman, mortal and still fascinating him with her yearning of joining his kind or die in the effort.I think Aaliyah is presenting us with a very attractive and credible Queen of the Vampires. I also think her role in this film is overstated, in the title as well as in many comments. She is contributing to the plot exactly what is needed and not more. I join others in the statement that for her, this was an ungrateful last film. She will not be remembered because of it like Lee will be for the Crow, but not because this is a bad movie, only because her role simply is not the central one. The central person is Lestat and his way through time. So we learn about his making, his dissatisfaction with his Vampire fate, making him the murderer of those whose attention and worship or even only company he craves and then the sort of suicidal decision to challenge all of his kind with breaking unwritten rules and do as he feels compelled to. This almost suicidal tendency he has in common with Jesse, the girl that has been raised under ominous circumstances and does seek the Vampires for reasons she herself fails to understand, there they are alike.. they are driven, forced to act in a way that other warn them is beyond reason and would lead to their destruction.This movie is fascinating in many ways. First there is the music, a score full of singers of bands like Orgy, Excess, Marilyn Manson.. something you not really would expect with a Vampire Movie, but really working well in exchange with the classical tunes one would expect, going along with the plot of the film and being of importance, not only some background aspect as in most movies.Second we have those main characters that really are well composed. Aaliyah personates the totally inapproachable cruel ancient Egyptian goddess returning on earth to spread terror again in a way she could not have done better. Stuart Townsend is making Lestat a sinister and profound creature of the night, wrestling with what contradicting emotions he is exposed to without getting a whiner. His way to interpret Lestat is superior to Cruise's performance in the prequel Interview with a Vampire.. for what reason ever. (IMHO this role here would have been asked too much of Cruise)Marguerite Moreau is making us almost feel Jesse's fascination, making us understand why she is the moth drawn into the fire and accept it as in its own twisted way logical.The plot is not as action packed as many would like and it is dwelling in its slow moments as well, it is a film you are drawn to on an emotional level and either it accomplishes that with you or it does not. What I love most though is its subtle humour and that not everything is stated obviously. Sometimes less is more, that has been proven to be true with this film again. It is a classical like or distaste case, I think. I for one love it.

I read the books nearly a decade ago, but I still remember quite a lot about the story. To make the novel into a two hour movie is a really BIG ask. To release it as this tragedy, well.The origin of Lestat is completely wrong (as any Anne Rice fan will tell you.)The back story of Akasha and Maharet was completely neglected. How and why did they become what they become? I know, let's not tell the viewer and let them work it out!Stuart Townsend as Lestat was okay, but he could only play with what he got. The major vampires from the story were delegated to background characters - Armand, Pandora, Khayman and Mael. And just where the hell was Louis???Aaliyah was surprising as Akasha, although I still believe someone unknown should have played the role; much goes the some for all of the characters.Jesse however was not turned into a vampire by Lestat, but by her Aunt Maharet after having her neck broken at the concert during a crowd crush.And they completely forgot that Maharet had a twin - Miriam - but that should have been covered in the back story.If they were to make a decent adaptation for this book as a movie, it would be close to four hours long, if not over. So I can see why they cut a majority of the story for a two hour movie.I just hope that some day, that Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles will be remade as it should be - a mini-series for each novel.

Besides, Korn is awful, and regardless of their talent, I don't exactly think of that when I think of something a vampire would sing.  I think maybe something similar to Type O Negative music, with NEW vocals, not just an existing band's song, may have fit a little better without sounding like glam rock, which is kind of what the book makes it sound like, and I think even that would work beautifully in comparison with the crap that comes out of Lestat's throat... oh sorry, I mean out of nowhere since it doesn't sound like Lestat or even close to it.This is pure tripe that was thrown together to take advantage of Vampire Chronicles movie rights, was made for a quick buck.  As a fan of the books I was insulted by the plot, and I don't think there would even be enough there for this thing to even make sense to people that haven't read the books.Avoid it.  Interview With the Vampire didn't follow the book 100% either, but it was beautifully filmed and retained the feel of the book.  This is crap.  Read the books The Vampire Lestat, and Queen of the Damned and you'll understand why, and you'll likely get a lot of enjoyment out of them in the process.

Those who bothered to read up on the movie would know that Jorge Saralegui did not make this movie as a sequel to 'Interview', and that he intended for the movie to make an entirely different kind of statement than the first. As well, each movie is, in itself, a different story.  Remaining true to the novel is not always possible, and is sometimes impossible due to time constraints and intricacies of plot development that do not come easily to the screen.Having said this, I believe the movie was very well done, and captured the characters' personalities quite well.  The interpretation from the original book was appropriate, even if some of the characters' roles had to be left out.  The sets were lush and the camera work was well done, providing a lot of eye candy for most scenes.  The acting is effective and thought provoking.

The deep layers that build up all the characters were shredded apart to only their surface, if not a completely different identity. The chronological order of the major events in the movie seemed warped and uneven.However, there were quite a few things the movie did to deserve my rating of 7. One was that the film strongly captured the affect that Lestat (among other vampires)had to the public, especially young girls. The movie also did a fairly good job focusing on the importance of heredity and history that the vampires took pride in. The scenes of sensuality were also atmospherically satisfying.The acting in QUEEN OF THE DAMNED was moderate, if disappointing. Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah have a surprising chemistry, though it only shows when the acting is at its best (not very often). The characters are nothing compared to the ones established in INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE. It also lacks the emotional intelligence of THE FEAST OF ALL SAINTS, which is a shame because Rice's Queen of the Damned book had that, and more.This movie doesn't give all that it appears to be. The effects are dull and very disappointing. The extravagance needed in many scenes is not given, and the dialog is tiring. The settings for many scenes are not how I pictured them in the book, and I think that many of them weren't even taken from the story. There are only a few areas of incoherence near the beginning and middle of the movie, but it wraps itself up fairly neatly, giving the viewer a full story (if they had not read the book).Somethings that I feel the movie needed include a good original score (Howard Shore or Elmer Bernstein), instead of the mix of rock music; though I had no problem with some of the songs. Another thing that would have made the movie better is better set direction. The scenery was boring as well as unclear, which is important in a story that moves around quite frequently.Overall, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED was an unevenly disappointing yet somewhat satisfying adaption of the important novel. With a few simple changes, it may have been a very successful piece of film work. I'd recommend this movie for people who has seen INTERVIEW or have read the books, so that they can make their own opinion on the adaption.

Let me explain first, why you shouldn't trust this as an adaptation of the novels by Anne Rice. The film makers think they stayed true to the spirit of the books. But how could it be possible, if they don't respect anything about the books?Most of the original character's personalities are totally altered or reversed; especially Jesse has no personality characteristics in common with the novel version what-so-ever. Lestat, who in the novel is joyous and happy, and becomes a rock star to see what happens and to do good for the world by revealing secrets of evil... is suicidally depressed in this film!! Marius is aggressive and cold, though in the novels he is very loving and gentle, especially with Lestat, and would never ever do some things he does in this film. Does that sound like sticking to the books's spirit and adapting the books's characters into a story adapted from the books?But then, what the heck, they also completely rewrote the guts of the story - the producers himself uses that phrasing about the matter. Completely rewriting something that crucial, isn't adapting. Rewrite 'the GUTS' of the story, says the producer. Tthat is in other words 'multilating the insides'. As in, butchering. They butchered the books and they admit it! They just don't give flying *beep* about it! But still, they talk about the production as if it was adapting type and this film is unfairly advertised as Anne Rice's though pretty much only the names are in common with her work. It's very misleading for others and very infuriating for some of the passionate The Vampire Chronicles fans, who usually are already dropping heads for the butcher in itself.I find it funny the producer complained about information overload as for why they couldn't stay more loyal to the books - yet they waste half of the film on something that wasn't in the book(s) at all. I'm talking about the so called romance between the characters Lestat and Jessica.Those minutes they could've used for real information from the books, on the Queen of who the title is about and the vampire history. Not only is that history important but it would've also given a lot of awesome atmosphere for this film as a vampire film as well. But even without this actually does work. You are only left to use your own imagination and speculations, which should not be all that bad thing.I think some changes they made good and working perfectly for the film since they were not really adapting the books anyway. They changed the person who makes Lestat into a vampire - that change just serves the film's limited amount of minutes so well, and even for the characters that was perfect. Even when comparing to the novels. (I have in-depth analyzed Lestat and that character's relationship in the novels, for two years.) This film however lacks showing how excellent substitute maker he is, because they abused the original characters' personalities.)Can't compare Townsend and Cruise as Lestat. They had completely different scripts in their hands Cruise had a wonderful script helped by the author herself. Townsend has a horrible mess of a butcher from a production that literally told Anne that they'd do whatever they want. And since that was a story completely different than in the books, it wouldn't have made any difference if Townsend had read the books. It's the story what makes the character who it is. But it's undeniable that Tom Cruise did put 100 times more passion into his portrayal, than Townsend did. But ST still makes a very fine Gothic rock star vampire and showed potential for a true Lestat in the very few in-character moments that were left for him in the film.As an independent film this is a pain because it's full of old clichés, which however could be bearable if only they had a logic storyline & relationships there, but it's all utter nonsense! Above all the Lestat/Jesse paiting they have there. Lestat clearly hates the woman and has every reason to, and he doesn't even imply at any point that he'd be interested in her in any emotional way - actually at all as a person. I don't know what the film makers were smoking when they made the certain two scenes, which had NO realistic development into them. In fact, one of them had a moment that totally contradicts something very crucial that Lestat had said in the same scene, like 5 seconds earlier! WTF!? I repeat; I don't know what the writers were smoking. And why there is no realistic development for the Lestat/Jesse relationship, is because the characters had NO romantic nor sexual chemistry what-so-ever, while they also meet only twice before the ending and they're both loaded with negative emotion from Lestat's side.This works well as a vampire movie in general - but if you want to introduce yourself to Anne Rice's Queen of the Damned and The Vampire Lestat - this film is not the way. If you do not know the books, and can ignore utter nonsense, you're probably the one enjoying this the most. And if you are a fan of the book - do keep open mind and think before you judge.The cast; everyone are great in their roles. They would've just deserved more true versions of their characters! I especially love Stuart Townsend as Lestat and Vincent Perez as Marius. The atmosphere of this film is darkly romantic. The music is hooking.Pick this film if you like vampires and you don't have anything else but this and Twilight at hand. Because, the two are the worst you could waste your time with, but this one is superior to Twilight, as this has actually vampires in this.

If you pretend that the only thing in common are a few of the plot ideas and the names then I'm sure it's a half decent vamp flick. I've actually not seen a book so butchered before.

In the past, I'd have read a book and then watch a movie, and I'd always be disappointed.  I've seen some bad ones(Little Women the one with Winona Ryder as Jo), and some very good ones(the HP movies, the Firm, IwtV). But this movie definitely falls under the bad ones category.Just before this movie came out, I'd made a vow never to support Anne Rice again by buying her books or watching her movies because of the travesties that were The Vampire Armand and Merrick.  So I didn't see until a week or so ago on cable.First, kudos go to Stuart Townsend.  I believe that for the most part, he captured Lestat and made him his own.  The scene with the two blonds at the beginning was very Lestat-like.  He captured his innate curiosity and his arrogance, as well has appreciation of living human beauty.  It also helps that his stature and carriage and beauty is appropriate for the role.The actor who played David Talbot did well with the lack of character development.  He may have been a tad too young, but he played the concerned father-like archivist/researcher true to character.Now Marius, what a piss-poor job of putting this remarkable and wonderful character on the silver screen.  The actor, in spite of this, is very good. I hope to see him in more, and better, things.Aaliyah, may she rest in peace, easily captured her character and portrayed Akasha expertly.  Her early death has robbed Hollywood of an actress with potential.The lack of the story of the twins and the explanation of the Great Family, one of the main plots in the book, is reprehensible.  This part of the book explained Marius' role in the vampire hierarchy, as well as Maharet, Khayman, etc. value to the storyline.  It puts Jessie in a frame of reference.  Without it, her character has very little importance.On the same note, the omission of Mekare is just unfounded.  There was no reason whatsoever to cut her out.  Especially as she is essential to the end.The scenery, costumes, music, and all the behind-the-scenes type stuff was done well.  The sound of Lestat's rock group was excellent, very well done for the modernization of it.I thought that for a stand-alone, it doesn't function as well as IwtV did. Because of all the gaps in the story and lack of character development, I'm glad I've read the book to fill it in.All I'm going to say about the end is that it is completely wrong.  And while that worked for The Firm, not so well for this one.In the words of Capt. Blackadder from Blackadder Goes Forth  Well, it started badly, and it, it tailed off a little in the middle, and the less said about the end, the better.  But, but, apart from that, excellent.Well, maybe not excellent, but maybe you'll like it anyway.  Afterward, read the book.  But just a warning, after this book, AR goes absolutely barking, and she loses her focus.  But this book is just amazing, one of my favorites.  Make up your own mind.

It's a shame too because it's a fantastic cast that is totally wasted. Stuart Townsend (About Adam) one of the sexiest screen presences in many years, plays Lestat as if he were impersonating Larry Hagman doing J.R. Ewing. I suppose the reason for his performance is shame about accepting money for it. He looked as if he couldn't wait for this movie to wrap. Victor Perez, another fine actor with enormous sex appeal who was devastatingly touching and heroic in Indochine seems equally embarrassed to be in this turgid mess. The homo-erotic connection between Lestat and Marius in Rice's novel of the same name might have been powerfully kinetic in the hands of these two sexy actors, but this movie cares more about admittedly stunning special effects showing bodies self-immolating. Akasha's hand in that is explained in the novel but not here, nor is Jesse's fascination with Lestat ever explained, or the reason for the Talamasca or the importance of Maharet (played by the always wonderful Lena Olin). These are important recurring themes in Rice's vampire chronicles that drove the novel, Queen of the Damned.  Without them, the final coupling of Jesse and Lestat makes no sense at all or anything else, come to think of it. If Ann Rice was upset about Tom Cruise playing Lestat, I can't imagine what she thinks about this mess.

I remember watching Interview with a Vampire, and loved it. Queen of the Damned is nothing Interview with a Vampire was... maybe instead of spending all of their budget on finding what teens today would like to see in a movie, they should have used it to get some talent, in all areas.  Stuart Townsend (Lestat) plays a awful vampire, given he has to live up to the extremely talented Tom Cruise, none-the-less, he can't even speak with a French accent which is one of the many inconsistencies of the movie.  Also inconsistent, is in Interview with a Vampire Lestat is searching for Louis (Brad Pitt), but in Queen of the Damned he has just awoken from his slumber of 100 years.But not to stick on inconsistencies, because this is Hollywood and no one expects perfection....Special Effects are at best sub par, the way the vampires move reminds me of the Matrix meets the Bionic Women, this is not a good thing.  Although there is a couple of cool moments, like when Akasha (Aaliyah) dies.  But once again there is just bad editing, when Akasha leaves the bar after she had killed everyone, there is a burning fire inside, and she just appears in the doorway, without having a shot of her approaching, when seen on film it looks terrible and in my opinion ruins the, what could have been cool, scene. And don't let me forget the obvious green screen shot of Lestat and Marius (Vincent Perez) on the billboard, that was atrocious.It seemed as though the creators were going for a PG-13 rating, because there is practically no foul language, and the sensuality? you can forget about that. Hey, i thought these vampires were supposed to be seductive?, there was no on screen chemistry,and the dialogue was absolutely horrid. Although there was some vampire violence its nothing to be proud of, nothing really made me gasp out loud, or say to myself oooooh, he did not just do that.  There wasn't any real gore, exempt from the decapitation, and the ripping heart. which were both not even as cool as they sound.The movie wasn't all bad. The sound in the movie was extremely well done, sound effects, and music were all top notch, despite having one of the stars die, before she could re-read her lines, to get better clarity. i heard her brother did all of her lines, and they mixed the two together to get what you hear on screen. Lighting was also grand, i can't remember a scene with bad lighting.Despite an attempt to appeal to me, a teenager, the movie falls way short. The fights are nothing new, the dialogue is pathetic, and the special effects do more harm then good.  I have no idea why they got stuart townsend to portray lestat, cause he couldn't act his way out of a 6th grade play.

And the other way around -- they just couldn't exist without what film has to offer. The best example to my mind is the vampire film. The form is a lot of useless gabble with people moving about setting up situations, and then you have a few, very few, powerful images. Those images are what matters, all else is forgiven, actually forgotten. Those few moments matter.In the vampire genre, as with a few others, it is all about archetypes. These have to be clear, deep, singular. Sex, dreams, anxiety. Self, blood and death. Vampires in film are strongly self-referential the vampire is from another world and enters the world of the story as a performer, just like all the other actors enter the film. That world-with-the-film helps to clarify the archetypes. Its why `Shadow of the Vampire' is so powerful. Its why these vampires are in show business, as were Banderes' ones in `Interview.'Anne Rice's idea was to map these archetypes into soap opera stereotypes. She has had some success with this strategy in selling books. But in the film version of those books, the filmmakers went back to the original film-vampire vision. These characters are not real like she intended, somewhat like Stan Lee made Peter Parker. No, these are good, old fashioned, pure archetypes. And it works, at least for me. Not the skinny strutting males, but these glorious women. The filmmakers knew what they were doing. There is a bunch of to and fro to satisfy the fans of the books -- this stuff is absolutely dreadful, at the level of John Carpenter's excrescences. But the whole thing is built around clever powerful images of Jesse, Akasha, and Maharet. These are played by striking women to begin with.--Lena Olin has been a sexual sorceress before. Her roles  in `Unbearable Lightness,' and `Ninth Gate' stick in my mind and few actresses do. She has in fact herself built some of that film archetype that she fills here.--Aaliyah has the lithe, cool sensuality of the second of the three basic types. (These are from Carl Jung.) It depends on and exploits elements of race we would be better off without, but she does do it well. If she hadn't died, I suspect she would have faded anyway because there just isn't much call for this sort of thing. (Remember the similarly striking Jaye Davidson?)--The third type doesn't require much, just to be a reasonably attractive redhead. Why a redhead I do not know just now, but that's the way it is. Moreau did this type well enough in `Firestarter 2' and does so here satisfactorily. Alicia Witt might have been better.That last scene with the three keeps this out of the toilet for me.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4 Has some interesting elements.

Basically vampire Lestat De Lioncourt (Stuart Townsend) is woken from his slumber by the sound of rock music, and he plans to be a success in the industry, with everyone knowing what he is. Jesse Reeves (Marguerite Moreau) is a journalist looking into the paranormal and obviously Lestat in particular, specifically his lyrics and past. The past reveals Marius De Romanus (Vincent Perez) was the vampire who made Lestat a vampire himself, and he disappeared years ago, but has come back to warn him that he should not be exposing himself. There is a point in the past when Lestat discovered a secret door leading to the statues of Queen Akasha (singer Aaliyah) and the King, and in the more recent days he bit her. This leads to her waking up, and gains her powers back by biting the neck of the King statue, and she is now on the rampage killing vampires at random until she finds Lestat. It all leads to Lestat's big selling concert performing his material, and Queen Akasha shows up to create chaos, oh, and Jesse finds out that she is the daughter of a vampire. In the end most of the vampires team together to drain Queen Akasha until she turns into fire and ash, and the new Queen becomes a statue, and everything is back to normal. Also starring Withnail and I's Paul McGann as David Talbot, Lena Olin as Maharet, Christian Manon as Mael, Claudia Black as Pandora and Bruce Spence as Khayman. It is tragedy that Aaliyah died in a plane crash not long after completing the film, but it is also tragedy that her final performance is pretty terrible. So she only looks good in her metal plated bra, the rest of the cast are terrible, the special effects look slightly cheap, and it isn't a scary horror at all, a waste of time. Pretty poor!

So many stories were cut, like the twin's legend (one of my favorite)Armand and Daniel's relationship and even Louis is not present, to mention a few.(The plot was dead) First, they should have made a movie of ''The Vampire Lestat'', because it is the second book after ''The interview with the vampire'',and not ''Queen of Damned''. They tried to squeeze in a single movie so many informations, that you finish not getting almost anything unless you read the vampire chronicles.So many meaningful characters doesn't seem to have a real importance in this movie. It is Pandora's case, for example.The actors that they choose to play all the characters doesn't match with many of Anne Rice's descriptions, specially Marius, that is suppose to be a beautiful,tall,imposing blond guy with blue eyes, like Lestat.

Back in ancient Spain (I think) a guy named Lestat (Stuart Townsend) is bitten by a vampire named Marius (Vincent Perez), who then takes him under his wing and introduces him to the vampire lifestyle. He really likes the power and immortality at first, but grows cool on the idea when he figures out that he will be pretty much alone for eternity. While sneaking around Marius' castle one evening, Lestat comes across a secret room where he finds two statues, the king and queen of all vampires. The queen's statue (Akasha, played by Aaliyah) comes partially to life, and Lestat drinks a bit of her blood and gains a bit more power, and perhaps a lot more attitude than he had previously. This increased amount of arrogance comes to fruition hundreds of years later (fast forward to the present), as Lestat is a Nu-metal rock star and has publicly stated that vampires are among us. The rest of the vampires get mad, Akasha comes back to life, they kill off all the vampires that oppose them, then Akasha offers Lestat the opportunity to be her king and rule over the world with her.There's also a subplot about some girl who was raised by vampires but wasn't one herself, who was sent away to live among the mortals but who always wanted to be a vampire, and she hangs around at a vampire bar and eventually comes back to the vampires who raised her just in time for the big showdown. Overall that whole subplot seemed like a distraction more than anything else.This movie has a lot of cool stuff in it. In ancient times, Lestat was a violin player, and when he finds the statues of the vampires, instead of being fearful he cheerfully asks them if they'd like to hear some music. It's scenes like that which make this a good movie. I'd say the acting is very good overall, as Lestat is quite a fascinating character in old Spain, though he turns into a complete cliché when he's a Nu-metal star. Aaliyah does an excellent job as the queen of the vampires, totally unsympathetic to humans, vampires, and pretty much anything else. It's the way the character needs to be, and she pulls if off very well. Looks very good doing it too!The biggest problem is all the MTV pop culture stuff. This movie is going to seem incredibly dated in 10 or 20 years. But Lestat's violin playing makes up for it. Some of the dialog and action sequences are supremely corny and very B-movie in attitude, but it doesn't drag the movie down too badly. It could have been great, but it turned out pretty good.

Everyone loved that. It was a hit! Unfortunately, 'Queen of the Damned' is only a sequel as it's using some of the same characters (characters, not actors &#x96; there's a difference) and set in the same universe, so to speak. Basically, it's not really a sequel. It's another vampire story written by Anne Rice following some of the characters who you might have seen before. Don't expect to see Tom or Brad in this one.However, just because it doesn't really follow on, doesn't make it a bad thing &#x96; a disjointed thing, but not a bad thing. But, in some ways, it's not really the film's fault. It's about a vampire who has got disillusioned with drinking people's blood over the centuries and has gone to sleep for hundreds of years. Now he's woken in the modern age and decided to 'out' all the other vampires and their blood-sucking ways. It goes without saying that the rest of the vamps don't take kindly to his outspoken ways and decide to take him out. So where does the Queen come into it? She doesn't. That much. Unfortunately she's only in it for two scenes because the young actress playing her tragically died while the film was being made, leaving the story lacking what should have been a big part of its central element.Plus it doesn't really do the book justice. I haven't read the book. I'm one of the many who just watches the film, but I've generally browsed through enough internet message boards to realise that a lot of die-hard fans of the source material didn't appreciate the transition to film.So, it's got its fair amount of negative points. And yet it's actually quite good. Not great, but somehow highly watchable (if you're into vampires in general). It should all be quite campy and yet Stuart Townsend plays the lead vamp pretty well and is actually fun to watch. Aaliyah, for the few scenes she's in, sizzles as the Queen of the undead. It would have been pretty good if she'd have been able to show what she can do all the way through the film.It's probably not a film you're going to want to see again and again, but if you're not totally bored with vampires after binge-watching box sets of 'True Blood' then take a look at vampires rocking out on stage and fighting each other in the chorus.

So, who expects Queen of the Damned will also be great is going to have a big disappointment. In fact, it's the worst vampire movies I've ever seen, sacrificing the dramatic and psychological depth of the characters in favor of a pop-rock approach of the vampire world, which seems to have been thought to sell the film to the teen audiences and not to make it better.Directed by Michael Rymer, this film has an unfortunate and shameful script by Scott Abbott and stars the singer Aaliyah (deceased shortly after the shootings) and Stuart Townsend in the lead roles. Despite this stars, the film goes from the grotesque to the comic, depicting the teenagers like a bunch of mentally retarded with serious identity affirmation problems.

It stars Aaliyah as the vampire queen Akasha, and Stuart Townsend as the vampire Lestat. Queen of the Damned was released six months after Aaliyah's death and is dedicated to her memory.Vampire Lestat is awakened from decades of slumber by the sound of a heavy metal band which he proceeds to take over as the lead singer. Achieving international success and planning a massive live concert, Lestat is approached by Marius, and warned that the vampires of the world will not tolerate his flamboyant public profile.Jesse Reeves, a researcher for the paranormal studies group Talamasca, is intrigued by Lestat's lyrics and tells the rest of the group her theory that he really is a vampire. Her mentor, David Talbot, takes her aside and tells her they know he is and that a vampire called Marius made him. He also shows her Lestat's journal that he recovered and is now in the Talamasca library. In a flashback to his origins, Lestat recalls how he awoke Akasha, the first vampire, with his music. Jesse tracks him down to a London vampire club where he saves and confronts her. She later goes to Los Angeles for the concert and gives him back his journal. The two spend some time together and Lestat shows her both the horrors and the perks of being a vampire. Showing him that she's not scared of him Jesse stays with Lestat as she sees how lonely and miserable he is. She asks him to turn her as she reveals that it's her dream to be a vampire, but he refuses as he won't do it to her. The more time they spend together, the closer they become and soon Lestat and Jesse start to fall in love. Meanwhile Akasha is awakened by Lestat's new music. She arrives and torches the club, and all the vampires inside, who want Lestat dead.At the concert in Death Valley, a mob of vampires attack Lestat and Marius. Akasha bursts through the stage and takes Lestat with her as her new King. The two vampires then proceed to have a sort of sexual intercourse in Akasha's home where they mutually feed on one another. During which time Lestat becomes spellbound by Akasha and is forced to obey her. Empowered by Akasha's blood, Lestat and the Queen confront the Ancient Vampires at the home of Maharet, Jesse's aunt, who is an Ancient Vampire. The Ancient Vampires were planning to kill Akasha, to save the human world from demise. Akasha then commands Lestat to kill Jesse as The Queen sees her both as an enemy and as food as she is Maharet's mortal niece and Maharet is a big enemy of Akasha's. Queen Akasha also wanted to make an example out of Jesse because Jesse dared to stand-up to her and to put fear into the other vampires. Lestat ostensibly obeys the Queen, but afterwards he quickly comes to his senses and is released from her power. He then very angrily turns and begins to drain Akasha's blood with the help of the Ancients. Mael and Pandora are killed by Akasha's power. Armand is almost killed, but is saved as The Queen's powers diminish. Maharet is the last to drink Akasha's blood, and thereby ends up becoming a marble statue. Maharet then becomes the new Queen Of the Damned.Lestat then turns and walks to where Jesse is lying lifeless, and cradling her in his arms, gives her his blood, turning her into a vampire. Jesse, now a vampire, and Lestat then return the journal to the Talamasca, and walk away, among mortals, into the night. As they exit it is shown that they are now a couple and hold hands while Marius enters the Talamasca. The film closes with a scene of David reading the journal as Marius's voice catches his attention, cheerfully saying, Hello, David.

This is no relation to Interview with a Vampire which was closely based on the book. Queen of the Damned is only loosely based on the original and there are some significant changes to the story and certain characters, even to the extreme of characters being left out completely.I myself am a huge fan of the books, but am also realistic enough to accept that the books contain such detail that they do not lend themselves easily to screen, except perhaps in the form of a film series such as The Lord of the Rings. So, as a stand alone vampire movie that is heavily influenced by the book, any grievances can be left outside.The film's story (spoilers!) in brief then, tells us about Lestat (Stuart Townsend), who has been at rest for decades but stimulated by the sounds of the time he rises, soon becoming the front-man of a successful metal band. Publicly admitting that he is a vampire and revealing vampire secrets within his lyrics soon draws the attention of the authorities, both of the living and the un-dead. It even wakes up the original vampire Akasha (Aaliyah), a very different creature to the rest of them, with near god like powers and an insatiable blood lust.We learn of Lestat's past life and of his creator Marius (Vincent Perez). We also meet a few of the other Ancients, namely Maharet, as the aunt of another main character, the Talamaskan Jesse who develops a fascination with Lestat. Jesse is the link the ancients have to the living but she soon becomes caught in the middle of the action.Marius therefore is a change from the book where he is not Lestat's creator, and the changes don't end there, however he is a compelling character and is well played by Perez. The plot is far from complex and has holes, but then it was never intended on being taken too seriously. Accept it for what it is and not what it isn't. It is not an accurate adaptation of the book to film, but as a stand-alone vampire movie inspired by it, what's left is a decent and entertaining vampire movie.The soundtrack of the movie is from Jonathan Davis of Korn, and other famous names from the industry including Maralyn Manson feature so the movie gives a very credible musical contribution from what is ultimately a fictitious rock band. This aspect is worth consideration after all, as if it had not been good, this film could have stunk!

In fact Memnoch The Devil is the only Anne Rice Book that I've ever read. However, after watching Queen of the Damned for the first time now, nearly 12 years after is release, I am intrigued by it's premise and will make time to go back and read both books. As for the movie, it is a middling affair. There are many positives, among them are Stuart Townsend's portrayal of Lestat, Aaliyah as Akasha, fantastic songs written specifically for the movie and a few stylistic flourishes here and there. I absolutely bought in to Lestat's hard rock persona. On a lesser note I couldn't help but make involuntary comparisons to Interview with a Vampire. Needless to say THAT is a better movie. Yet this movie could have been much closer in quality had some more elaborate choices been made in regards to special effects, a moodier screenplay and a greater focus on detail in general. There is absolutely zero tension or suspense in this film in thanks partially to it's metal music overload. I like the songs yet I feel that the dramatic scenes would have been better served with a more brooding or sinister soundtrack. Also, the climax was a bit rushed or underwhelming or trivialized. Not bad though.

Anne Rice devotees are in for a major disappointment.The adaptation is weak, the budget low and the overall production leaves a lot to be desired, which is perhaps the reason why none of the a-list actors from the 1st movie (Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Kirsten Dunst) decided to show up in this flick.If you forget about the comparison to the brilliant Interview with a Vampire and the original novel than this movie can pass as a mediocre 'vampire-turns-rock-star-teenage-goth-movie' that will appeal to the same audience as Buffy The Vampire Slayer or Charmed.2/5points.

And.......As a 21st Century vampire movie, Queen of The Damned, isn't bad. Despite its plot flaws, it's visually appealing and has an awesome soundtrack. (Not really my preferred type of music, but I do appreciate some of it. And the music was very fitting for the film and Lestat character.) Chock full of special effects, the roles were well cast (for Gen. Y'ers to whom the movie appears to be directed) and performed.....for a vampire flick.Just not an Anne Rice Vampire flick.Granted it's been a few years since I've read Rice's Queen of the Damned (a book I adored btw), but this movie bore no resemblence to the novel whatsoever. Why on earth it bears the novel's title, I have no clue. Aaliyah's Akasha appears in only...maybe...15 mins of the entire film. The rest is a rather disjointed mess (relative to the novel) and runs like an overly long music video. (Why is Pandora---a former Roman noblewoman---walking around in an Indian Sari?!??!!?)The DVD's special features section has about 10 deleted scenes, which in my opinion, the producers should have left in the movie. That way, the movie would have made a heck of a lot more sense and we would know who the hell is who.  Other than Lestat, no one else is recognizable. And Lestat only because his name is repeated over and over and over and over again.Though Stuart Townsend makes an appealing and sexy disaffected and rebellious vampire turned rock star, Lestat he is not. His portrayal (more a flaw of the writers than his acting, I think) shows none of the maturity, cunning, nor charm Lestat should have had after a few hundred years of existence. This is particularly true given the Lestat character Tom Cruise played in Interview with A Vampire and given that the events of that movie took place long before those of this one. (Please note that Cruise wouldn't have been my choice for Lestat either, but in the end the character he turned out was well done.)I found Akasha's shimmying around annoying.  If its purpose was the emphasize the Queen's etherealness, it failed.  She comes off looking more like a second-rate backup dancer/groupie than Queen of all that is unholy. Again, this is not the fault of the actress, but one of the writers and director. However, I did get the impression that Aaliyah's portrayal would have been much better had they given her more to do than shimmy around.Vincent Perez's Marius was one of the more all-around appealing characters, if inconsistant. Of indeterminate sexuality, the character of Marius displays at times his loneliness and disenchantment, yet a certain mischievousness (sp?), as he should be. The inconsistency comes in the fact that he's never really one or the other in the same scene. His personality seems to shift for no reason. Yet another fault of the writers.The Jesse character was well-played by the actress (sorry, I forget her name). And the love story between her and Lestat was fitting for **this** version of ***a*** vampire movie.  Tho, she kind of made me feel, will someone please slap her. But since, I can't remember the character from the book at all, I don't know if that was intentional or not.As for the other characters, there wasn't enough of them on screen to really offer an opinion.In sum, if you want to see a visually appealing vampire movie for the new millenium, rent Queen of the Damned. If you're expecting any resemblance to Anne Rice's books and their characters stay far, far away.

Of course, to do this they've had to cut much of the story, but the truth is that they've made it so bad that they've made this movie to be ridiculous. There are many changes from the books, some of them very important, like the vampiric origin of Lestat. The character of the Queen has no sense. She doesn't speak too much and we don't know which are their reasons to act like that. Very important characters as Louis, Brad Pitt in the first movie, aren't in this movie (although they were in the book). If you've read the books, you'll see that you have to read the end credits to know who are some of the vampires.But not everything is bad in this movie. They've made a great work with the music, giving Lestat his own videoclips and great performances in the concert. Unfortunately, the script is so bad that buying the music CD is like buying the 80% of interest things in this movie.Too far from 'Interview with the vampire'.

I have never read Anne Rice's books, therefore, this film had nothing to live up to, except Interview With A Vampire. About 30 seconds into the film, I realised that comparing this film to Interview... was pointless, they are obviously two very separate interpretations of one author's work. Interview with a Vampire was a stylish take on vampire movies, this is the same-old-same-old.  The one thing that made the film thoroughly enjoyable was Stuart Townsend, not for his acting, but because of his uncanny resemblance to Brandon Lee in The Crow.  That and the fact that his French accent kept slipping and his Irish accent showed.  I have a thing for both Brandon Lee and the Irish accent.  I can't imagine the same holds true for every viewer, so I'll move on. Aaliyah.  Hrmm.  Ok.  I think she probably did the best she could with what she was given, but to be honest, I wasn't impressed.  (I'm just a lowly British nobody who got a D in GCSE drama, so I'm well aware that Aaliyah was far more talented that I could ever hope to be, so let's not get upset about what I have to say). Marguerite Moreau was enjoyable, but I couldn't get past the fact that she was in all three Mighty Ducks films and kept expecting her to ice skate and start quacking.

Stuart Townsend is kinda good too but if we compare him with Tom Cruise, he need to worked more harder to became a biggest actor.

Aaliyah's character is a total flake.  We don't even get her true voice in this movie.  Another point, if you liked Interview with a Vampire  (I didn't when I watched it, but that was 94, now 8 years later maybe I've changed) you probably won't see much connection between the two movies.  In the first movie I came to hate Lestat.  In it's sequel, he's supposed to be the hero. That and now it's about Vampires who grew up watching The Crow.  Even Vincent Perez (Crow 2) is in it.  What can I say?  Unoriginal?Watching Aaliyah's character get hers was pretty much totally lame.  No tension whatsoever.  Boring?  (Anyone screaming in the theater needs a head check)The casting of Lestat was totally off base.  To go from Tom Cruise to this nut?  Couldn't they of picked someone a little older?  A 200 year sleep certainly can't make a vampire look younger can it?Still, this movie beside itself is better than a few vampire movies I know.

After reading the reviews, on here, about Queen of the Damned, I was convinced to skip it at the theaters. It was pretty obvious by the scorching reviews that this was not going to be a cinematic epiphany. It should be noted that I am and always will be a huge fan of Anne Rice's work. I have read and loved the Vampire Chronicles by her and Queen of the Damned was one of my favorites. I know how Hollywood works though and had rather low expectations on how they would treat this story. While being grateful that I didn't pay theater prices to see it, I also feel it doesn't deserve the flaying it has received.First of all most of the movie was based on The Vampire Lestat and not Queen of the Damned. Second, no, it is not possible to contain the entire scope of this story into 111 minutes. But then, what do you do when the lead actress dies suddenly? Do like they did on The Crow and try to put some semblance of a motion picture together? Exactly. I think they did a pretty good job here, considering. While the performances weren't &#145;break-out' they were passable, they did move the story along. And there WAS a story here, a diluted one, yes, but a story just the same. It didn't follow the books exactly but you recognize enough of the characters that your memory can easily fill in the gaps. In fact the people that read the books should have had an easier time with this than those who did not. As always there was artistic license taken, especially with the ending but, given the circumstances, I felt the attempt to capture the feel of the books was there. The look and movements of the vampires were exactly as I imagined from the books, which was missing from Interview. (Go back and look at that film again. Especially the scene when Pitt is burning down the mansion. Talk about over-the-top drama! And tell me Mathew Newton as Armand, in this one, did not at least LOOK perfect; far better than Antonio Banderas in Interview) It may have been better converting the books into a mini-series or chronicle like the Lord of the Rings movies but, alas, not so. I don't think an attempt should or could have been made to put these stories on the big screen until now. I think if an attempt would have been made back when the Vampire Lestat was first published (1985) it would have been laughable. Today's music, fashion and attitude just seem to fit better. Not to mention the special effects technology is far superior now. What better time for Lestat to rise than this period, when we have Marylin Mansons and Rob Zombies running around? Why not a Vampire Lestat? (You know Trent Reznor would promote him and he'd wear Dolce & Gabbana just because it was expensive) Although this movie certainly fell short of the mark I feel it was attempting to reach, it wasn't horrible to watch. In fact as just a movie, not considering the novels, it wasn't that bad at all. It was no worse than those Mummy movies. I truly think the makers did a pretty good job cleaning up the mess that was left. The overall look of the film is, in my opinion, slick, stylish and enjoyable. Some say it looked rather MTV like&#133; well, don't you think it was supposed to and shouldn't it be so? We are dealing with the brat prince, Lestat de Lioncourt, right? Don't you think Lestat himself would have taken advantage of the MTV generation? You don't really think he'd settle for public access, do you? All in all, this movie was like a long, pretty cool advertisement of what could have been with some music videos thrown in. It's worth the rental price. My thoughts. Yours?

I've been an Anne Rice fan for a few years, having only read the books because one of them was titled 'Pandora'. I did not know it was, in any way connected with Interview with the Vampire, which I saw. 'Pandora' was the first novel I could actually sit though, and thus I read every Anne Rice book I could find. Didn't touch the erotica though. Interview was a good flick, but not one I can watch alot. Seeing as I am partial to the female charactors, and I relate to them, I could not wait for a movie to be made based on another one of the books. So one morning I heard QotD was being made, and watched it's progress religiously. But I noticed - things were changed. Minor to major. Charactors chopped out, story slammed with another. An invented movie based on a book I loved. But, finally Feb 22nd came and I went to see it. And so the review begins.I had to seperate book from movie, but I was glad I did not completely. The film starts up with a nice instrumental type melody, showing the stone faces of Those Who Must Be Kept. We're then introduced to the charactors we'll see throughout the rest of the movie - by means of Lestat's video playing and the cast rolling up. I have to say the music was catchy, and sent shivers up my spine. I was surprised, as I am not that big on Korn.But I did find myself getting fidgety and testy at the plot line changes, while some of them I liked. For instance I hated what they did to Jesse - transforming her into a teenage goth. But I liked how they tied and wrapped up Lestat's and Akasha's backstory of how they 'met.'But as the movie progressed I found myself having to explain certain things to those who went with me. I.E. - When the Ancients first appear at the concert, those near me had no idea who they were. They came out and appeared as Maharet's posse - so I had to name them, as the movie did not. What burns me up is there were two original scenes involving the Ancients - one where they rise to Lestat's music, and another where we hear their names and whom they are.The movie progressed along - but it was choppy at certain points, and an explanation was not to be found. None that I could give, either, as the movie had changed so much from the book. But you got the drift through underlying themes.Now, the end really did burn me up. As there really was none. It left you with that Is that it? feeling, which I hate. It was sort of rushed, as if all the Vampires realized the sun'd be up any minute and they better hurry up.But the movie was visually stunning - from the background sets to the camera sweeps. Each cast member either went to two extremes. Failed miserably or came out with a parade. Aaliyah was perfection as Akasha, I must say this was her better movie, as opposed to Romeo. She conveyed the essence of evil and malice, with a childish bratiness. Vincent Perez was not a bad Marius, but could have been a little better with his accent. He sounded - odd. Stuart was not bad either, but he either looked like he did not care, or was trying too hard. The other actors who are barely featured were good, but not there enough to know. Lena OlenMaharet, Claudia BlackPandora, Matthew NewtonArmand, and Christian ManonMael looked great appearence wise, but Bruce SpenceKhayman looked..eh, not Egyptian. The supporting cast fit the book appearence better than Lestat and Marius.The action scenes were not bad, and the gore was kept at a higher pace than that of Interview. There is a scene in which Akasha shatteres a beating heart in her hand. Another which shows a man with his throat gashed open, bleeding violently. So the movie is not for the really squeamish.Overall I realized this is a movie that one either loves, hates, or is directly in the middle. Most hate it, and yet most love it. So it really does depend on the person. Ignore the bad reviews, and the good ones, and rent it when it comes out - as that would be the best thing to do. But by all means, watch it.High Points - Music, Sets, Costumes, Certain Cast, Camera, Some Plot. Low Points - Certain Cast, Most Of The Plot, Ending. Overall Rating - 7.5 out of 10.

For roughly ninety percent of the movie, I was rooted to my seat, mouth slightly ajar, eyes glued to the screen with the type of horrified awe that is normally reserved for children watching their homes burn to the ground.  The plot is non-sensical and painfully contrived.  No ten seconds passed without me muttering W...what?! to the person beside me.

However, absolutely nothing happened.  Nothing.  The plot all leads up to the most pointless and boring climax I have ever seen.

But I do know what I enjoy and I do know what films are aimed at me and my peers. One of these films was Queen of the Damned. This film was clearly aimed at the youth of today, hence the hot guy as the main man (Lestat) and hot girls as both Akasha and Jesse. This is about all we teenagers need to enjoy a movie cuteness in the opposite sex, and upbeat music. This movie provided that just nicely, thanks. I didn't read Queen of the Damned, I have seen Interview With the Vampire, and read the same, along with many others, including Merrick, Memnoch, Taltos and The Tale of the Body Thief. I may just be a simple teen, with simple thoughts but if we can't sit down to a movie produced by the ENTERTAINMENT commitee (especially of Australia, which barely ever creates, or is involved in ANYTHING this big) for our ENTERTAINMENT without analysing it, tearing it apart and seeing how bad it really is, then we all might as well just die now, because there is nothing left for us to just relax and have fun with. The world is a hectic place, and something where we don't have to run around and keep up with, chasing deadlines etc should just be accepted, GRATEFULLY, and enjoyed. SMILE you people who didn't enjoy this movie, it should be a nice change. It could always have been worse, boring, longer, dull... Just because it doesn't follow the book to whatever extent you may deem fit, doesn't mean that it isn't an impressive, enjoyable experience.

He is very beautiful and moves like a vampire. I found him strangely alluring despite his hammy accent and near constant mugging at the camera. It amuses me greatly that Stuart Townsend left the set of smash hit LOTR TFOTR after creative differences and ended up on this disaster movie. Vincent Perez plays his maker Maurius just as camp and there are some amusing exchanges between the two vamps. I particularly enjoyed the scenes where they sit in front of the mammoth billboard of Lestat and a discussion they have about late twentieth century fashion. But this is where it unclear whether the director and writers is taking the film seriously. The actors clearly are not. This is truly demonstrated by the casting of Aliliyah. Although she looks the part as Akasha, the mother of all vampires she gives a performance that is wooden at best. It reminded me of a school play, not least because she looks like a child at a costume party. I am a fan of Anne Rice and I believe she offered to write the screenplay for this film and was turned down. That, I think is a clear statement that this was to be a departure from the original Interview with the Vampire The Vampire Chronicles, which boasts the talents of Brad Pitt and a bizarrely unrecognisable Tom Cruise as Lestat. Townsend's Lestat is different from Cruise's but no less valid. (Cruise was pretty hammy too.) But then Anne Rice did create Lestat as a mass of contradictions. Queen of the Damned's visual design is lavish but lacks the sumptuousness of Neil Jordan's production. The special effects are good although they sometimes feel out of place. Despite all these failings there is still something I liked about the film. I could easily watch it again. Credit is due to Paul McGann as David Talbot for managing to keep a straight face. I didn't.

A real shame that the depth and complexity of Ms Rice's better early Vampire novels were lost. Characters crossed the screen for no apparent reason, and only reformed goths like me could point and say oh, that's Mael. In fact, the film bore so little resemblance to The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned that they may as well have called it something completely different. So, no story, no development, poor pacing. But it's a very pretty film, and Stuart Townsend is a very pretty Lestat (better in some respects than Cruise). The stage fight is hilarious (watch out for the wires!). Paul McGann occasionally looks like he's asking himself what the hell he's doing in this film.

So I went to watch this being a huge Aaliyah fan.I honestly did not know what to expect but hey it was a pleasant movie.First off Stuart Townsend convinced me as Lestat, a dark, mysterious and confusing character. Why, oh why was Tom cruise Lestat in the first movie, I don't know. If they ever decide to re-edit and remaster the whole of Interview and replace Cruise with Townsend, I will be willing to watch it.I wish Aaliyah was given more screen time. Akasha's story before becoming a statue would have made the film more interesting. And as i said I love Aaliyah to the bone, and I was destroyed when she died but she did her job well in the movie. She convinced me as an evil tyrant queen so much so that I felt no remorse when she was defated. Aaliyah simply looked stunning throuought the movie and was imploding with a sense of regal sexiness and sass.The story held together well, but more as an action movie. And I agree the story could have been more detailed and gone more deep. But the two lead character's Lestat and Akasha shined.The soundtrack was amazing, I am not a huge fan of rock music but I thought it worked well. I was hoping to hear some of the more trippy stuff aaliyah had done. I was hoping I Am Music a tripped out track she completed with Timbaland days before her death would make an appearance.

Nor is it likely to win over any new converts. Its tone is too camp and outre for mainstream horror fans, and who - apart from the two groups mentioned above - is going to walk all the way to the local multiplex to see it?The film's central disaster is its casting of baby-faced nonentity Stuart Townsend as that immortal blood-sucking rock-and-roller the Vampire Lestat. Not only does Townsend lack even the faintest glimmer of Lestat's demonic charisma, he also has no discernible talent of any sort. Even if he did, would it make a blind bit of difference? When Anne Rice brought Lestat back from the dead and turned him into a rock star, she was inspired by such immortal rock androgynes as David Bowie, Mick Jagger and Sting. In the film, poor Lestat is lead singer of a Goth Metal band so egregiously awful that his world-wide cult success is as baffling - nay, as downright inexplicable - as anything else in this misbegotten mess.The only way to give this Lestat an illusion of charisma is to cast a lead actress even duller and less talented than he. Sure enough, this film obliges with one Marguerite Moreau. Pray tell, what amateur acting class did she escape from? And why on earth did director Michael Rymer grant her more screen time than Aaliyah, who plays the Vampire Queen herself? Aaliyah's non-performance sinks to such delicious depths of camp, you may even enjoy it if you're in a perverse mood.The only real pleasures to be had are two rather shamefaced cameos by two aging Euro-stars, Vincent Perez and Lena Olin, both criminally wasted as the senior vampires. As for the lurid costumes and sets - Lestat with a leopard-skin sofa? I think not! - they call to mind such trash 70s classics as Dr. Phibes Rides Again, only minus the wit or imagination.

In spite of what you might have heard it's not that bad.The plot is a tad confusing. This is another adaptation from Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. Lestat (Stuart Townsend) creaks open his cozy coffin after 200 years rest because the music has improved. He's sensed that heavy metal/goth music is in vogue and he hungers to be a blood swilling, pale faced, satanic rock star. (There's a marketing tie in somewhere in that I'm sure.) Anyway he gets hooked up both with a particularly nasty vampire from ancient Egyptian times called Queen Akasha (Aaliyah), and an admiring human Jesse (Marguerite Morea). In keeping with the homo eroticism that is never lurking too far below the surface in vampire flicks, Marius (Vincent Perez) would also seem to be on the list if only Lestat would give poor Marius a chance.   Then there's Maharet (played surprisingly by the usually exceedingly lovely Lena Olin) who seems to be something of a mother figure to a coven of vampires. Anyway, somehow, we proceed to a big vampire battle in Death Valley at a rock concert!Queen Of The Damned will appeal to those lovers of the genre who are starved of them.

The Vampire Armand, Interview with the Vampire, and Blood and Gold, as well as Pandora, are all such character based novels. Queen of the Damned, however, is the one novel which is NOT character based, but instead is more of a historical documentation of Vampires. There is no star; in Queen of the Damned, or, if there is, it is the history. In combining aspects of Queen of the Damned and The Vampire Lestat the movie succeeded in capturing neither fully.

As a huge fan of the books, my main complaint is that I didn't really get a chance to care about any of the characters. First of all, there was way too much emphasis put on Jesse; I didn't care about her when I read the book, and secondly, Lestat (through no fault of Stuart Townsend), came off as possessing precious little personality. The fact that Lestat didn't have blonde hair is rather unnerving, but I am willing to forgive that blunder simply because Stuart Townsend is REALLY frickin' hot! Also, in comparison to Interview with the Vampire, which was handled with oodles of class, this one came off feeling kinda cheesy, and I found myself laughing at times I probably wasn't supposed to. I will give the writers a smattering of credit though, simply because they had a hell of a lot of characters and events to squeeze into 100 minutes.

This movie doesn't even come close to portraying the Chronicles' characters, and in fact doesn't even include some of the most important people, leaving you with a bunch of vampires who just happen to have some of the same names.On a light note, the soundtrack rocks, Lestat is looking delicious, and the over all scenery can be very beautiful. However, only the digital effects, makeup, and the music made this film even worth trying to satisfy one's curiosity.The movie itself is very unstable. The characters are confusing, and Lestat even has the wrong accent; he's supposed to be French, but in the movie he's Irish. The narration was retarded. I felt myself looking away a few times because I couldn't even watch, and just sitting there laughing the whole time at the movie's absurdity. Like Townsend said, it really is a cheesy film.If you've read the books, however, you're in for an inside joke with David and Marius. They've never even conversed in the books, but here they seem to really like each other- and just WHAT do those two have in common? )Don't waste your time seeing this and buy the soundtrack. 2/10 "},{"Title":"Good Actors and a Killer Soundtrack do not a Great Film Make","Date":"26 March 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  I have been following Anne Rice's books for the better part of a decade, and if am disappointed with this adaptation of Queen of the Damned, I cannot begin to imagine the disappointment of the real purists who have been reading since the appearance of Interview With the Vampire in 1976.One could forgive the executive decision to combine and condense the books The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned if certain key plot elements had been retained.  It certainly makes for a smoother plot to shift the credit for Lestat's creation onto Marius; after all, it gives the viewing audience a much more credible motive for Lestat's seeking him out, at least more credible than an insane vampire turning Lestat and immediately immolating himself.  But what is completely irreconcilable in such a compaction of two novels is the altering of the protagonist's basic character.  Lestat, in his own words, prefers to feed on evil low life types.  It is just this predilection which sets into motion the events of Memnoch the Devil.  And yet we see him preying on the innocent at least twice in this film.And what have we lost in this foul and pestilent congregation of vapours? The story of Lestat.  Allusions through wolfskin rugs just don't cut t.  -- Marius and the making of Armand; the mystique of Those Who Must be Kept and Rice's take on the true origin of vampires, a good story in itself set in ancient Egypt.  -- Lestat's friend Nikki and the origin of the Theatre des Vampires; and, integral to Lestat's character, his struggle with the concept of the world as a Savage Garden.To me, it's a terrible tragedy that movies like this make it to perhaps a much wider audience than the books they're based on.  The Vampire Chronicles have established Anne Rice as a crafter of stunning prose filled with sumptuous imagery, and horrors that are not so much visual as they are emotional and spiritual.  Those of us who know her characters long for more of her stories about them, and to us, this movie is a rude insult.

Now I know that it is just a movie but to take the books Vampire Lestat, and The Queen of the Damned, and come out with a movie this choped up, is just wrong.  I think any true Anne Rice fan would hate this movie because of how chopped it is, but if your looking for a fun will directed Vampire movie then is the Queen of the Damned.  And if you have not read the books see the movie first so you are not so mad at the end of it.  The one thing that I really like was Jonathan Davis' Lyrics and background vocals for Lestats sing.  This movie had it ups and down like all movies do but I would have to say that it was entertaining to watch because you did see Lestat come to life, Stuart Townsend was great for the part, except for his black hair, Lestat has long blonde hair, but he was good for Lestat de Lioncourt.

(possible spoilers)","Date":"21 March 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  Despite its huge opening weekend, many people were disappointed and Queen of the Damned fell drastically after the opening. As for me, on the other hand, I loved it. Worlds apart from its predecessor Interview with a Vampire, Queen of the Damned portrays a wildly original twist on the vampire legend. Lestat wakes with a desire to walk openly as a vampire. He joins a rock band as their new singer, and markets himself as a vampire gimmick. Brilliant!!!The late Aaliyah makes the movie in every sense. The film is entertaining before her first screen appearance, but, as Queen Akasha, she pulls out all the stops. At once incredibly frightening and incredibly erotic, Queen Akasha exudes a presence unlike any other in the film. We can only speculate where her acting career would've taken her after this. Coupled with her music, her role in Romeo Must Die showed her vast talent, but it wasn't much of a stretch for an R&B star to portray that role. Queen Akasha, on the other hand, was light years away from it, and truly gave the world a glimpse of a new screen legend. And then there's Lestat. Both Tom Cruise's and Stuart Townsend's interpretations of the character were erotic, arrogant, end edgy for the timeframes of each movie, but I seriously doubt Tom Cruise would've been effective reprising his role for Queen of the Damned. Stuart Townsend, having appeared mainly in indies and lesser-known films before this, adds a unique and welcome twist to an established character. Anne Rice fans will probably be disappointed, if they aren't already, but that's mainly because her unique vision wasn't really represented here. She wrote the Interview with a Vampire script, so that vision shone throughout. That's where Queen of the Damned fails, in that it's someone else's idea of her vision. All in all, as a casual Anne Rice fan and a huge fan of the contemporary vampire lifestyle, I had a blast from credits to credits. Oh, yeah...the soundtrack was AWESOME!!!

I had been eagerly looking forward to it. It is a good thing they skipped to making the third book into a movie, since the first left WAY too much out as those who actually READ the books know. Now, to the actual movie. First thing I noticed that made me happy is that they made Lestat more like the Lestat in the book. It stayed more true to the character. Tom Cruise's portrayal made Lestat into a fop. Another thing I was pleased about was that Lestat this time had a mild FRENCH accent. This time they remembered he was a FRENCH nobleman. The actor portraying Marius is not what I pictured and tended to lean more towards Armands personality in the books, but did a good job none the less. Once again though, they took many many artistic licenses in the story. (ie  as you know, Marius did NOT make Lestat )As for the Queen, I think she was underplayed. But I found it interesting. ESPECIALLY her accent. Since none of us (mortals at least...) ) KNOWS the EXACT dialect the ancient (6,000 years ago) Egyptians spoke, What I heard from her sounded a great deal like the way Yul Brenner sounded playing Ramseys. But hey good news to those other Anne Rice fans........They didn't take as many liberties with the ages of he characters as they did in the first one. Armand actually looks like he is described. He is quite young in appearance, not in his 30's, but they did make David about 25 years too young. There are several scenes that they should have kept but didn't unfortunately. Was I the only one hoping to see Jessie's experience in the New Orleans Town house? Not there. Also they left out several key characters like a twin for one. And still, with all this, I really enjoyed the film regardless of the deletions. The only part I really didn't like was that the showdown scene was too short and kind of anti climatic.

Not only was the entire story line way off base from the books (since about half of the movie was from The Vampire Lestat), and thus the entire series, but there were even parts that ruined the entire theories behind vampires themselves that Anne Rice put into all her books.  The defamation of the characters is one thing, the omission of extremely important characters is terrible also in itself, but undermining the entire vampire persona is simply inexcusable.

There are more characters in the book then in the movie, or so I thought. Half of them show up in the credits, but you'd never know they were there since there was hardly any character development. And what was the deal with Maharet and Akasha? Can we possibly get some clue as to their connection before we have this big showdown???

Stuart Townsend,in my opinion, was a great choice for Lestat especially compared with the ham job Tom Cruise did in Interview. Stuart actually came off as mysterious, sexy, and lethal. Aaliyah was beautiful as Akasha, but I think it would have come off better if they hadn't used sound effects to give her this big spooky voice.

She really gets into her parts.  The movie, in the beginning, was slow, but it picked up quickly.  The action started and the film suddenly became really exciting.I think what made it exciting for me was Lestat and the relationship he ended up having with the girl who was obsessed with him.

Lestat has been lonely too long; he decided to roam the earth in light among mortals. Against all other vampires consent, he became a rock star and exposed himself as a vampire, not to mention sharing deep vampire secrets to the mortal world. If you have read the book, Lestat has exposed himself before by becoming an actor in a theatre.In the movie, Lestat was made by Marius, who left him in despair and loneliness, but not after he taught Lestat enough lessons to live in shadows amongst mortals. You might understand Lestat's loneliness and his delicious pompous b**tard attitude more if you read the book and realize that he was in fact made by Magnus, who killed himself just after he transform Lestat into a vampire. Lestat was probably one of the only vampires forced to roam the mortal world without proper introduction to vampirism.So, what is the movie got to do with the Queen of the Damned? Basically, Lestat awakens Akasha who wants to rule the earth with demonic powers again as she did in the old days. Akasha, or She Who must be Kept is well portrayed by Aaliyah, although I must say, she does not have to be in this movie. I mean, she's only appearing in probably 15 minutes of the whole movie! I think they should just call this movie The Vampire Lestat and dedicate another separate movie to Queen of the Damned. Anyway, salute to Aaliyah who is very beautiful and graceful as well as demonic as Akasha. even though she could try a more Egyptian accent instead of the usual Vlad Dracul's Romanian/Hungarian accent...And finally, the rest of the characters. hmm. what can I say about the rest?

I mean, if it takes more than two hours to describe one book in 'Interview' how could they thought to achieve 2 books in a less than two hours movie.Nevertheless, it is, like I said, a tribute to Goths and as a Goth, I truly appreciate the music, the depiction of the band, Davis' cool voice and Stuart's wonderful stage performance. Stuart, you should really try forming a Goth band!!I truly despised the depiction of Lestat's tenderness towards Jesse by the end of the movie. This is not the Lestat I know, this is not the Lestat that was portrayed earlier in the movie. The Lestat that was afraid to bite when he sees blood. hello? What's going on here? And the Lestat that fly with too many sequences, especially the scene where he took Jesse for a flight. it made me think of Superman!Oh, and the ending, where he walks hand in hand with Jesse, saying hello to David Talbot. what can I say. this movie is really just worth to watch to hear great music and see beautiful people like Stuart and Aaliyah.

However, I still held on to that thread of hope that I was wrong.I was so right.Casting While Stuart Townshend *almost* looked the part of Lestat (at least closer to the right age than Cruise), he was too inhuman, so to speak. He lacked any of the quasi-sensitivity that Lestat himself battles with. He seemed more like Mr. Lee in the Crow than a Vampire. as far as Aaliyah is concerned, I was at first slightly put off at the choice, but she wasn't all that bad...for the 10 minutes of screen time they gave her. How generous that the title character shows up at the end, only to die just as the plot is beginning. Vincent Perez as Marius, albeit not a mirror of the book, was charming and I really felt he stole the show...Margeurite Moreau as Jesse was cute but miscast in the part. Armand looked like a crackhead, and Mael (or was that Khayman????) looked like Lurch. Pandora was perfectly cast, but for some odd reason the writers decided to kill her off...without ever giving her a line. Funny thing is, she filmed quite a few scenes with Marius, but they all hit the cutting room floor.As for the inconsitencies between the book and the movie? Sorry, I don't have all day.

I read that you are the first black Egyptian queen on film, and you more than excelled at it. There are many comments on your Bela Lugosi accent, and I don't know if that has to do with the post-production re-creating of your voice, or if it was in the director's image and yours. Whatever it maybe, I think it is a minute detail, and doesn't change the fact that your acting was eerie as it needed to be. It reminded me of Tim Burton's girlfriend on Mars Attacks! As it turned out, your performance was a guest appearance on a soap as ethnically diverse as Friends. Although it was titled after your role, the story really was about the ugly duckling who wanted to become a bat, and the magic of cinema turned her into a fanged goth duck. Once a duck, always a duck, what can I say? Unfortunately that show never took off, which is understandable because the only feeling of suspense I got was whether or not Vincent Perez would lose his head again or not--he lost it for the French, then the Russians put it in a jar, so I was wondering if his Transylvanian fate would be any different. But somehow the pilot ended up hitting the silver screen, and around the world people will enjoy your presence. Thank you for your talent.

By the first hour I was wishing someone would put me out of what seemed to be the eternal misery cursed on me by the filmmakers.As a writer myself, and a fan of Anne Rice; I expected much more. I at least hoped for an adaption even worthy of the other misguided Vampire flick based on her ever worthy series. Unfortunately I did not even get that. Instead we are presented with a rambling, pointless showcase of Jonathan davis's Music, which is not even up to par of his past forayes into the subject. We were given a descent performance by the late great Allyah who only had a total of 19 minutes screen time, that is unless you count the time she was a statue in the film. Even then her acting job was much better than the rest of the cast.being a published writer in this genre, I believe i know a little about the subject. Therefor I must say it is most unfortunate such a excellent novel could be misconstrued to the point that the very essence of the story is lost in the process. I dread seeing what they can do to ruin the best book of the series Minock THe Devil in its rumored upcoming production, I suggest the movie company look into hiring the screenwriter used for the flm adaption of Red Violin, another of Anne Rices great books, and the director of The Kindred series, that was based on the game Vampire of The Masquerade. At least both of these were worth 7.50 admission and the 2hrs of your life you will never get back.

Although I would say off-hand that the movie SUCKED!, it had enough good elements to bring me back a second time...and possibly a third.  The reason is not the story, which is a weak handling of an impossibly thick plot, but for the MUSIC!  All honors go to Jonathon Davis for his work, and for the artists who performed these songs.  I didn't take to the idea of a vampire, even Lestat, becoming a rock star when I first read the books, but the musical element in the movie won me over to Lestat more than anything else could have.I must also agree with the contention that Stuart Townsend pulls off a VERY good Lestat, and totally creates the rock star persona that Tom Cruise never would have.  Also, Vincent Perez brings the old-world style of Marius quite well, although trying to mesh his character with Rice's written Marius is near impossible.As for the rest of the characters, I was utterly disappointed that they remain unnamed and unexplained, as does Akasha's real purpose in awakening. If you haven't read the book, you will wonder why you should care what's going on.  And if you have read it...you will be sorely disappointed that most elements in the movie are a result of production decisions.  As for the Jesse character, that storyline in the movie does not work one iota, and leaves Lestat lovers with a bad taste in their mouth.  Lestat would not have fallen for her- or at least, not bothered to make her a fledgling.On a positive note, Rymer gave this movie both a look and a feel that work beautifully, with punk characters, and interesting imagery.

"},{"Title":"Fun schlock for a Friday night...","Date":"2 March 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  I remember when Rice's book, INTERVIEW..., was released the FIRST time in the 70s.  I was in junior high school at the time, read half of it, and tossed it in the bin to take its place with the rest of the trash.  For the life of me, I never dreamed the book, one of the most poorly written I'd ever picked up, would be resurrected years later AND find an audience. So, all that said and bitchy as I am, I thought the film version of INTERVIEW... was abominable.I was particularly disappointed in this film because it was directed by Neil Jordan who, having worked with Angela Carter on THE COMPANY OF WOLVES, should have known better how to convey the eroticism and arcana of vampirism.  Sadly, none of Carter's insight into vampire lore seemed to have rubbed off on him or Rice.  As I mentioned, I never finished reading INTERVIEW; but, judging the film version on its own merits, it was as bad as the book; ultimately, a film of wasted opportunities and too much posturing; an exercise in pretentious presentation of a subject as if it is new and undiscovered; an assumption that its audience is too dumb to know more or better.But QUEEN...is another story altogether.  When I first saw the film's trailer, I groaned audibly, but, a few days later, I began to rethink it. Why was I taking it so seriously?  Why didn't I just go see the film for fun, for fantasy, for Friday night and leave it at that?  So I went to see it this evening, and I enjoyed it!I must admit, I'm not entirely sure why I enjoyed it. The opening credits sequence with its homage to DAS KABINETT... is, at this point, cliched. Townsend's accent is dodgy and his posing and sneering tiresome.  Frankly, posturing, by a number of the film's actors, is a major flaw of this film. And there was just too much MAC and talcum powder all around and not particularly well applied, I might add. And was so much money spent on make-up that there was none left to pay a script editor or language coach with even a basic knowledge of French?  Between all the different pronounciations of the name Lestat and such glaring mistakes as Je suis Lestat... I have to wonder.But, on the plus side, there is a real heady dose of artful, decadent, old, and older, world arcana on display particularly when the narrative shifted, early on, to the vampirizing of Lestat and his first encounter with the gorgonized Akasha.  Also, Akasha's later presentation is splendid, bizarre, beautiful, and grotesque all at once, and, as far as I'm concerned, worth the price of admission. Also, it was interesting to see a heroine who is hairier than the hero--adds a certain earthy frisson to the proceedings.Having seen so many horror films and vampire films, in particular, I have to say that QUEEN's plot holds its own.  Frankly, in terms of plot, I've never seen a thoroughly satisfying vampire motion picture; and, to make it easier on my willing suspension of disbelief, I find it best to approach them completely on their own terms.  Sometimes it works--the enchanting vampire film VALERIE AND HER WEEK OF WONDERS comes to mind--sometimes it doesn't (see INTERVIEW...).  QUEEN falls squarely in between, and it's just right for a Friday night.

I thought we had left the times behind where horrible directors threw a cast of talentless wannabes together and stole the idea from a popular book but completely changed the story. I guess not. Watching this movie was nothing but hilarious for my girlfriend and I. We were offended for a few minutes but then just decided to laugh at it.Where this movie went wrong...well, it was made. But I can point out a few specific reasons. First, it was targeted towards the teenagers and well, they were the ones who walked out of the theater. Aalyiah should have never been in movies. Didn't Romeo Must Die teach us that? Jet Lei fans refused to watch that movie...that's a clue. And choosing Korn as the voice over for the band. Now, I love Korn but...can anyone else picture that voice coming out of a vampire. C'mon. Insane.Second, the acting was poor at best. I have a feeling we aren't going to see anyone from this movie in the future. Except for bit parts on Soaps. I didn't pay attention to who did the casting but, whoever you were, don't expect to be asked to help them pick for anything again. In all fairness I have to say Lestat looked the part more than Tom Cruise but, and this pains me to say it, did a worse job. He bounced around from being convincing to being a no talent hack.Third, what the heck happened to the plot? How can you sum up any novel in 25 minutes? (Being as that was about all that was from the book) See, if the teenagers walked out and the Anne Rice fans walk out...what do you have? I can't believe this movie is making money.Now, in it's defense. Some scenes were very well done. Only the ones with little dialogue but well done none the less. IF you can take this movie at face value it may be worth renting. If you want a laughable night at the theater, I recommend it.

I am a big fan of Anne Rice and have read every book in the Vampire Chronicles and the New Tales. The movie starts out pretty decent, with great affects and music, but not far into the movie the story changes from the original quickly. The first noticeable difference being that Marius was Lestat's creator and teacher. WRONG. The movie continues along a path fairly scewed from the actual story line and finally comes to a not so climactic ending involving many of our well known vampires being in a room without their name ever being spoken. Characters who are in stories far after this one are killed by Akasha and others are never even brought into the story. The entire climactic death of Akasha is created from the mind of someone who obviously has no idea what the story is about and ends extremely quickly. I believe it would be safe to say that no more than 30% of this movie stays true to the novel.For those who have never read the book this movie will also keep you wondering. As I stated, vampires are thrown into the storyline without any information about who they are and why they are there. The story moves slowly at the beginning which is nice, and some of the story is explained, but then suddenly you are thrown into a scene where nothing is explained and the movie is suddenly over. You sit and wonder what was the point?The visual affects are great, and were extremely well done, but story wise... I'm surprised Anne allowed such a movie to be created.

They have combined the novels The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned--a catastrophe in and of itself, since The Vampire Lestat itself could hardly be told in on very long movie and would be better suited by two.The storyline has changed emphasis from Akasha's love affair with Lestat to a non-existant romance between Jesse and Lestat. As those who have read the books remember, Lestat's only interaction with Jesse was on the stage at his concert for a mere moment. Nothing there to indicate even the slightest hint of a romance.The characters have been poorly chosen I've seen. They have dropped several of the key characters in the story as well.The cruelest thing they have done, however, lies in the fact that the script writers have attempted to combine two highly detailed novels into a single movie. For some this act might be understandable. For myself, it has brought about a full boycott upon the movie.

I saw queen of the damned with a few friends and my expectations were not very high considering all the garbage that has come out of hollywood in the last few years. However i was not prepared for how bad a movie could be.  I felt that myself and everyone in the theater with me was made a little less intelligent by having seen this movie. After the first 5 minutes and the music video that awakened Lestat was over I had enough.  His hilarious and absurb press conference was confusing and stupifying.  No character in this movie acted as if the writers had even created characters for them.  No one's actions were explained, no part of the plot made me want to find out what was going to happen, there was nothing more annoying than having every action sequence act as if i turned on mouse delay in windows (macs are better anyway).  As an audience it's like i'm being talked down to like i'm a small child with this movie.  Not only were the voiceovers poorly written and sounded very metallic, but they provided no incite other than that the director and his crew didn't feel like making a movie, but merely a series of shots that could be easily tied together with the characters explaining it to me.  I have not read any or Anne Rice's books nor have i seen interview with a vampire, but i fail to see how this is even relevent.  Every movie should be able to stand on it's own without prior readings or viewings.  The editing was atroscious.  The violin dubbed sequences were way off and the violin's were not even well tuned.  The well placed product labels also became quite annoying as did the stupid way the vampires always flew at something.  Nothing was more embarrassing than the laughable family reunion/fight Akasha part (not to mention that her vampire caps were visible quite often during this sequence). What i wanted to know most was why Akasha didn't just burn up all these vampires the same way she did in the Vampire Club.  I guess she forgot she had those powers, and she must have forgot that she shouldn't show up to the vampire meeting as soon as they decide they need to kill her, that seemed to be a bad idea too.  If i was the director i would have fired the entire cast and just hired Korn to make a 90 minute music video concerning the themes of the songs that Jonathan Davis wrote.  I guess the only redeeming value to this movie was how well it taught me that hollywood pumps out bad movie after bad movie and people pay to see them. "},{"Title":"I enjoyed it!

I noticed this film was shot in both Australia and the USA, and have a question for those who may have seen another Australian film called Looking for Alibrandi. To the best of my knowledge, two performers from Looking for Alibrandi are also credited in Queen of the Damned--Pia Miranda and Matthew Newton. In Alibrandi, Matthew Newton played 'John Barton,' and I was able to spot him again in Queen as the vampire 'Armand.' Meanwhile, Pia Miranda, who played 'Josie Alibrandi' in Alibrandi, is credited as 'Jesse's Roommate' in Queen of the Damned. I thought I might have spotted her in a quick shot in which various images were rapidly flashing through (as I remember) Lestat's mind, but that was a scene in which Jesse was not onscreen. Does anyone know the background story of Jesse's roommate? Does Lestat meet her at some point? Perhaps there are additional scenes we can look forward to when the DVD comes out.

The story strayed from the path of the book, Stuart Townsend, while making a very awesome, intimidating, and intense vampire who was very convincingly a rock singer, did not make a good Lestat.  Tom Cruise had Lestat down to a T.  The melodramatic self pitying whining know it all who thinks they should run everything.  Townsend and the concert scene were the only two redeeming qualities of the movie.  I'm a heavy metal and rock fan, and I found myself ready to mosh in the theater at that time.  Kudos for getting my attention with good music written and produced by a great guy, Jonathon Davis.  He also made a good Scalper in the movie.  Another disappointment, the ending.  It was nothing like the book. And all the vampires at the end, if you hadn't read the book or looked at this site you wouldn't have an idea of who they were.

From the viewpoint of someone who has read and enjoyed the books, and knows the storyline, and Anne Rice's descriptions of the various characters, this was a truly bad movie.  Essentially, it was a strange melding of the two books (The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned), which neglected many of the elements that made the stories enjoyable and interesting in the first place.  In the case of Queen of the Damned, massive parts of the storyline were left out even though they were main portions of the plot of the book.  It was badly miscast, with most of the actors nothing like the descriptions of their characters in the books.  They even had the vampires' fangs on the wrong teeth!  The main thing that leaves me puzzled about this movie though, is how they could call it Queen of the Damned, when, in actuality, the storyline centered around the main plot of The Vampire Lestat.Despite the many, many faults, it could be enjoyable, provided one had not been an avid fan of the books.  Stuart Townsend, despite his physical differences from Lestat, was excellent in his portrayal of the vampire. But other than that, I have nothing good to say about this movie, except that it would be fun to go see it again, just to yell at the screen whenever something strayed from the books.

For instance, we don't have Lestat...we've got a Louis/Lestat combination.

But I am not going to get into how much the film diverted from the book (which is expected with  adapting one format to the other) but on the film alone.  Rest assured, other Anne Rice fans have already nit-picked by now, already. ;)First off, the acting was not bad.  Aalyah was the PERFECT Akasha and deserves any awards she is nominated for this role, her last performance.Stewart Townsend was, visually, a superb Lestat, however, his excessive posing and blank `Bono-like' stares were just a little annoying and got in the way of his performance in some scenes.  The rest of the cast did workmen-like performances.However, I fault mostly the script, which was, in of itself, hard to follow. For a movie titled `Queen of the Damned'  we know far more about Lestat than we do Akasha.  So much is left out that even HOW she became a vampire (the Mother of ALL Vampires, at that)  is missing!  Plus, there's the attempted forced love interest between Lestat and the mortal Talamascan Jesse, the rather rushed flash-backs of Lestat's past, and other undeveloped characters (did anyone even KNOW that the other three vampires were Pandora, Armand, and Mael?).  Add to the confusing focus of the direction of the film (is this a Vampire flick, a Alternative/Goth Video, or a kung-fu/Buffy the Vampire flick?) with its  nausiating, overused crane and helicopter shots for most of the scene changes, you have a patch-worked film that just feels as though it was rushed to be released and tried to compensate (and failed, CGI and all) substance with style.

Interview with the Vampire (the movie) had the mood of the first book, had the darkness and the sensuality and it had the pain of Louis.  It also included a bit of the homoerotic theme that is so prevalent in Anne Rice's books. Queen of the Damned is lighter more full of fun, and that was perfect because Lestat had none of the pain and deep internal struggle of Louis from the first book/movie. Did it capture the mood of the book? Well, no. It was sexy and the actor who played Lestat was PERFECT!(Stuart Townsend) He was lithe and sexy and smoldering and devilish in short the brat prince himself.... Basically Tom Cruise's performance as Lestat is rendered lackluster after seeing this guy.... Now the rest of the movie <sigh> Well, if you love the characters and the story of The Queen of the Damned (the book) then you will be disappointed, because this does not follow the story at all.... no Daniel, no Louis, Lestat is Marius's fledgling and they basically take Armand's story of becoming a vampire and turn it into Lestat's re- birth... Only one ancient red head instead of the twins of the book, and she is played by Lena Olin (who does not have red hair....) I'm not sure which one of the Vampire Coven was Armand.... but in the credits he is listed so apparently he was there... and finally Aaliya, she was not good and that breaks my heart since she is no longer with us, she was so beautiful, much like all the Anne Rice characters are supposed to be, sweet, pure and lovely....

So see the film for the sexiness, see it for the Stuart Townsend, the man who plays Lestat, or for the fun music ( sounds like Korn) but if you are a fan of the book, don't expect the story you loved, it is not there.For horror fans it is great fun, violent but over the top violence, for anyone else I would give this a pass, I'm sure the story is even more confusing if you haven't read the book.

Unfortunately the union of Lestat and a band seems really rushed.  We get introduced to an even older vampire Marius, whose past seems very interesting but you feel cheated because they do not even develop this character at all.  Its all about the good looking/modern vampire Lestat and any other vampires in this movie are secondary because they are not as good looking as Stuart Townsend.

Leave them with their noses buried in their books, but by all means, form your own opinion on the movie.  I think it was very good piece all around.  Townsend and Aaliyah communicate sexy characters very effectively, and the director avoids the pointless nudity that is found in many Vampire movies.  Furthermore, there is plenty of biting, bleeding and burning, but it's not a gory bloodfest that many other Vamp. films become. These elements lend a certain credibility and class to the film.  Clearly the Rice fans wanted another Interview..., but Michael Rymer weaves his own film, a hard rock vampire venture that is more in the vein of The Crow.Townsend is great as Lestat (he plays Lestat himself, not Lestat through the eyes of Louis, as Cruise did in Interview) Seeing Vincent Perez (The Crow City of Angels) in American film again was fun. Marguerite Moreau plays Jesse, a mortal woman who takes and interest in Lestat, in a subplot that some complain of as underdeveloped. Complaints about the subplot are unfounded, as simply paying attention will allow you to fill any small gaps or confusing elements in the story.  Apparently some need to be spoon-fed everything and are unable to handle any little bumps in a film.  Check out the official movie web site, where you can find very informative notes from the producer, addressing the decisions they made in the film making process. With Blade 2 soon to be released, fans should catch Queen of the Damned now, since it offers a modern Vampire story, that doesn't have what I call the Post-Matrix feel to it- that is to say all around black vinyl and unrealistic fight scenes.  It's a great Vampire movie. Enjoy it.

Which, in some senses I felt was good in the case of Queen of the Damned.  I went into the film with no preconceived notions, or expectations.  With that said, I really did like the film.  Personally I feel the studio should have taken her (Rice) up on her offer to write the screenplay for free.  I do feel that the movie completely raped the book (though I never read it).  I feel the people behind the film wanted to make a rock -n- roll film about vampires, and left the actual story of QOTD out of the picture.S. Townsend is by no stretch of the imagination a better Lestat than Tom Cruise.  His delivery is slow and predictable.  Cruise was vicious one minute and suave and gentle the next.  He was Lestat!  Aaliyah was beautiful as Akasha, Queen of the Damned.  Though her movements were almost robotic, she still protrayed a graceful, diabolical and beautiful killer.  Her scene at the Admirals Arms was superb, and she really did well making the other vampires...Ash!Okay, my big gripe!  I am not sure about the book, of course.  But I would think that if a 4000 year old egyptian Vampire/Goddess were ressurected in modern times, she would not be so worried about finding a new king, and then ruling the world, but instead just taking the world by the throat (Pun intended).  I mean this chick can toast other vampires, and destroy any mortal.  I would think she would be able to rule the world within a matter of hours.  A 4000 year old Egytian vampire/goddess arises from her stoney prison, with the power to rule mortal and immortal alike, with the thurst and ablity to rule the world.  Now that is your movie right there.Overall, knowing nothing of the book, I did like the film.  Though, diluted with eye candy, and Matrix-like speical effects (which I wasn't too impressed with), the film was good.  I would have liked to have seen Aalyiah much more of screen, and much more evil.  I just though Akasa would have been a total kick ass bitch, but she was much more sophisticated and wicked.  Some favorite scenes  The Concert in Death Valley (Especially Akasha's entrance) Akasha's walk thru the Admiral Arms Flashbacks to when Lestat was created Akasha's chamber The dual at the endI know fans will hate this film, espeically if all the reviews I have read are heartfelt.  But for those who haven't read the books, or don't feel they need to devote their lives to trying to be like the characters in Rice's books.

If you're going to hype the movie up by saying that Aaliyah is in it, then please, for the love of God, show her more than 20 minutes!! Also, this movie didn't follow Interview With the Vampire very well.  First of all, in Interview With the Vampire, Lestat was up and around from the 1700's to circa 1994.  In this film, he has been asleep from the early 1800's to circa 2002, which equals to about 200 years.  What happened to the entire century he spent with Louie?  By the way, that brings me to my second point  in this film, Lestat whines about how alone being a vampire is, and how horrible it can be feeding off people and living for all eternity.  In Interview With the Vampire, he had Louie and loved being a vampire and feeding off people.  When did Lestat develop a conscience for humans?? Lastly, In Interview With the Vampire, Armand (Antonio Banderas) was the oldest living vampire.  In Queen of the Damned, Marius is the oldest living vampire.  How did that happen??  How can this movie be a sequel when it's so different from the last film??  Besides the inconsistencies from the last film, Queen of the Damned was boring.  I was squirming in my seat the entire time.

Stuart Townsend is better at the modernized Lestat and Tom Cruise is slightly more archaic. As for Aaliyah, she made quite a presence for herself. She succeeded at being a real bad-ass with sex appeal. Who wouldn't want her to suck his/her blood? It was indeed a shame that this was her last movie, for she was convincing of her evil role despite her perfect popstar image.People in my opinion were afraid to appreciate a pop culture vampire story.

Still, whoever decided to replace Tom Cruise with Stuart Townsend as the one and only Lestat made a great decision.  He captured the tremendous sexuality needed for this character after the terrible picture painted in Interveiw's storyline.  Sadly, taht was all that saved this movie from being a terrible endeavor not worth the price of the Early Bird ticket special I got for the first show.At any rate, if you've read the book, you will notice the obvious screw-ups in the plot line and you will catch the obvious characters that weren't introduced as they should have been (aka Maharet, Mekare, and Khayman). Still, the movie could have been a LOT worse and the soundtrack with Stuart's look and Margurite Moreau (in a role that's a far cry from her Mighty Ducks appearences)as Jesse make the movie enjoyable to an extent.

Queen of the Damned is definitely the latter.Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt first showed audiences what it must be like to be tortured vampires in 1994's Interview with the Vampire. It was the first time we had ever been exposed to the emotional side of a vampire. Tom Cruise's Lestat de Lioncourt created one of those characters that will go down in film history for his uniqueness and effervescent charm.   The sequel had a major casting change Tom Cruise is out, and Stuart Townsend is in. Did it make a difference? Yes and no. Townsend is no Cruise, but his portrayal of a modern day Lestat was more than satisfactory.  However, the storyline left much to be desired. Too much.Lestat, made a vampire in the 18th century decides to take a long rest and sleeps for over 200 years. Rock and roll music breaks his slumber and he realizes that in the 21st century he can be the person he could never be before, accepted, admired, a star. He becomes a successful rock and roll icon. His newfound popularity gets the attention of other vampires who want to kill him and one vampire in particular who wants to love him. Enter Aaliyah.Contrary to what movie marquis and commercials would like you to think, Aaliyah is not the star of this movie.  She had about 16 - 20 minutes of footage. It's difficult to separate Aaliyah the talented entertainer whose premature death is still a source of mourning in the hip hop community, and Aaliyah the budding young actress whose sophomore film project was terribly disappointing. It seems like an act of betrayal to laugh at her performance because she can't defend herself. Not to mention that in an interview her brother Rashad related how happy she was during the filming. Makes the UC feel kind of bad. But I have to be true to myself. Aaliyah plays Queen Akasha the mother of all vampires.  She falls in love with Lestat and wants to rule the world. Although she is Egyptian, her accent is reminiscent of Count Chocula. I don't blame her. That is clearly a directorial blunder. Her movements are over dramatized, over rehearsed and her character lacks depth. With the exception of the title being 'Queen of the Damned', you really need never know she had anything to do with the film at all. If you are an Aaliyah fan you will probably enjoy seeing her and consequently love the film because she's in it. However, if you are an Anne Rice fan, or a vampire film fan, or even just a lover of film, you may be very dissatisfied with the adaptation of what was an excellent book. Sometimes that just happens.In the movie's favor, the music was awesome.  The UC is hip hop for life but I must give props to the real rock and roll. In addition, Vincent Perez and Marguerite Moreau made up part of a fine supporting cast as the paternal vampire and vampire chaser.

I rushed to screen this movie with the excitement of a kid...and well, it wasn't quite what I thought.  First of all, there are MAJOR differences in the movie, like how Maurius supposedly fathered Lestat (a flashback) which, in the book he was friends with Maurius..he was fathered by someone else.  The ending happens in a different way, and the characters have much different qualities than those of the book.  Basically, the plot is KIND-OF the same...but as far as the characters, they should have changed the name of the movie along with the name of the characters and it might have a chance in the movie theaters.  The way it is, however, is going to upset quite a few Anne Rice fans, me included.  The visual effects are exciting, but in a few places, it gets really grainy.  I feel that the character Lestat needed more background..which is WHY there was a book in between Interview with the Vampire and The Queen of the Damned.  There was much too much emphasis on on making the bad guys seem somewhat scary and not enough on development of characters and actual plot.  I have to say that Stewart Townsend tried, however, in his failure, I hope he realized that he tried TOO hard to seem cold hearted.  The frequent head movements reminded me of junior high girl fights...with the chicken neck and everything.  Marguerite Moreau however, was wonderful here.  I think she portrayed her character very well and was, to me, quite convincing until the end.  The settings were VERY well done, just like something out of a dream, and it was beautiful.  Alliyah's last performance was ground shaking.  She was most convincing and actually seemed to become the queen, Akasha.  However, there are some questions I have about the movie's vampire rules.  I mean, every movie has to have them...just what are their limits?  And their clothes seem to have a physical connection to their bodies...I would love that to be explained.  All in all...don't go in with much expectation...and you'll love it...that, or see the movie, THEN read the book.  I think you will enjoy it more.  The camera angles were interesting...some different techniques.However, the rotating room/box is boring and they could have done better.  I mean, does a vampire's hair flow down his back when he's upside down?  Just curious.Don't take kids to see this movie, please.  I know, I'm one of those parents who take my kid to movies that are not meant for his age, and even though he is much more mature than most, I refused to take him, and I'm glad I did.  It was gory at times, and unnecessarily bloody most of the time.  It's been done before, but I wanted to go home with more than I did.  Oh well.

"},{"Title":"It's got *some* bite","Date":"22 February 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  If the 1994 adaptation of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles, Interview With the Vampire (IWTV) was Gothic, then the 2001 adaptation, Queen of the Damned (QOTD), is goth. I read all the books years ago and I am a fan of the 1994 film, so I'm writing this review from that perspective. If you have no prior experience with The Chronicles, you might well be confused by QOTD. If you do have experience with The Chronicles, you might well be disappointed. I wasn't confused, nor was I entirely disappointed... so there's hope.Here's a rundown on the movie's plot, in case you haven't read the books Lestat de Lioncourt is a vampire who, after decades of hibernating, is awoken by modern rock music. It speaks to him, and makes him want to add his voice to humanity's song. He joins a rock band and leads them to super-stardom, which makes the vampires of the world very nervous. What if their secret gets out? Jessie Reeves, the youngest member of The Talamasca (an ancient academic order of scholars of the supernatural) and her mentor, David Talbot, read Lestat's journal from the 1700's, which explains (and shows us in a flashback), how the vampire Marius made Lestat. Lestat's journal also introduces us to Akasha, The Mother of All Vampires, and tells of how she sleeps, frozen in time. Jessie's aunt, Maharet, is (unbeknownst to Jessie) a vampire who is among those who wish to stop Lestat from telling the mortals about their kind. Jessie is drawn to Lestat and seeks him out. As it turns out, Lestat isn't the only music-lover... Akasha, hearing his song, wakes up and decides to make a hell on earth.I think both movies pretty well capture the spirits of their respective books -- IWTV, seen through Louis's melancholy eyes, is introspective, pensive and darkly beautiful. QOTD, seen (mostly) through Lestat's hungry eyes, is rock 'n roll, rebellion, and destruction. The books are from different perspectives and are quite different from each other, so it's reasonable to expect that the movies will also diverge.Much has been made of how many liberties director Michael Rymer and the screenwriters have taken. There are indeed quite a few the story of The Twins is completely gone; Lestat is no longer the leonine blond golden boy; Louis is excised; Marius, not Magnus, creates Lestat, and so on. But remember, the director of the first film also took several liberties Louis's younger brother is changed to a wife and child; Claudia is made about five years older; the wonderful Gabrielle character is gone; Lestat is not at the vampire trial that condemned Claudia, and so on. It is simply not possible to recreate such richly detailed books page by page, and each director must choose to focus on what about the story appeals to them and then bring that to life on the screen.As a major fan of the first movie, I have to remind myself that the, er, stakes were really lowered for this version. There isn't an all-star cast, Anne Rice didn't write the screenplay, Michael Rymer isn't Neil Jordan, and Stan Winston didn't do the vampire makeup. Once you can look at it on that level, it's not bad. And certainly not as bad as it could have been... I heard Josh Hartnett was up for the role of Lestat. Thank goodness he was unable to accept it! He is so not Lestat.Lestat, who comes second only to Count Dracula in the vampire popularity contest, is an extremely important role. A few years back, I heard that Wes Bentley had been cast. This was shortly after I saw American Beauty, and I thought, Yes! But then he dropped out, asserting that he was too tired to take on such a challenging role. He went on to make such tired, forgettable films as White River Kid, The Claim, and Soul Survivors. QOTD may not be a masterpiece, but it sure looks like one alongside any of those stinkers.Heath Ledger was also taken into account as a possible Lestat, but he too had other projects lined up. The producer, Jorge Saralegui, has stated, We considered just about every young actor, as you might imagine. What about Ryan Phillipe? He has the French-blonde-aristocratic physicality of Lestat, the sadistic playfulness (as seen in Cruel Intentions), and he's very handsome. While he has an interesting look, Townsend is not that handsome and while he does sometimes capture flashes of The Brat Prince persona, he does only a passable job. (He's probably better as Lestat than he would have been as Strider in Lord of the Rings -- his firing from that show freed him up to do QOTD.) Much better is the casting of Aaliyah as the title character, and Marguerite Moreau as Jessie, the Talamascan mortal who falls for Lestat.Contrary to what the TV spots might lead you to believe, Aaliyah only has a minor role in the film. It's a pivotal role, but quite small. She was only given one dimension to work with (ancient evil), but boy, did she work it. She plays it up with heart-eating relish, flashing her preternaturally green eyes, smiling with bloody fangs, and undulating in a skimpy costume topped by an elaborate Egyptian-style headdress. I wasn't especially impressed with Aaliyah in her first film (Romeo Must Die), and I always thought she looked too sweet in her music videos to be able to play the mother of all vampires. But she does it, and she does it well. I liked the effects used for her voice (and her brother's voice -- he did some posthumous looping for her), and I thought the ancient Egyptian accent was cool. (Was it accurate? I don't know... it's no worse than the characters in Stephen Sommers' Mummy films. I bought it.) Akasha is gorgeous, regal and a royal pain just like she was in the book, and Aaliyah, with great screen presence, obviously had a lot of fun playing her.People who have not read the book will have lots of questions about Akasha. Where did she come from? How did she become the first vampire? Why does she start out as a marble statue? Why was Marius taking care of her? Why does she want to destroy the world?The other characters, richly realized in the book, now relegated to minor roles, will also beg more questions than they answer. In QOTD, there is no dark gift lovingly bestowed by Lestat, no savage garden world of vampires. Lena Olin, who plays Maharet (her twin, Mekare, is not mentioned in the movie) is a vampire who had a daughter before she was transformed. Maharet has spent her eternity looking after her ancestors, especially her granddaughters (Jessie is really not her niece, but a direct descendent). Armand, Mael, Pandora, and Khayman are all in the movie but they serve as nothing more than window-dressing. They have no dialog even, but at least they're better off than Louis -- he was completely cut from the story. The Marius and Talbot characters are greatly altered, but that didn't bother me too much. Paul McGann as a younged-down Talbot is as good as he can be given what he had to work with, and Vincent Perez made for a believable enough creature of the night. He's a bit of a fuddy-duddy, but he was like that in the book too (remember, this is from Lestat's perspective; Marius is trying to keep him from his fun).Some of the dialog, and some of the humor, from the books is retained. Lestat, remarking on Marius's centuries-old taste in clothing, remarks, How did you ever get through the 50s in red velvet? And there's a part where Lestat says something to Jessie about not being very good at staying alive, and she shoots back, We have that in common, don't we?The real star in QOTD is Marguerite Moreau as Jessie Reeves. Her beauty is, unfortunately, not treated with the same care as Aaliyah's was -- the DP, Ian Baker (The Chamber, Fierce Creatures) uses very flat, unflattering lighting most of the time. In fact, a skin color for the vampires could not seem to be decidedupon -- Lestat alone alternates between white, blue, tan and ruddy. His gothy makeup (lots of eyeshadow and lipstick) may rankle some, but I was okay with it. The person whose makeup and lighting was too neglected was certainly Moreau's -- she's a beautiful woman, but you don't see just how attractive she really is in the movie. She has some good costumes, though (I think we may be seeing her tight, push-up plaid school-girl inspired jumper on the racks this spring).The music (written and performed by Jonathan Davis of KoRn) is pretty good and it does rock, but if Lestat has gone goth, I imagine his music would have been more Smashing Pumpkins like. The Pumpkins' music was very hard (Bullet with Butterfly Wings The world is a vampire...), but lushly beautiful and melancholy (By Starlight) at the same time. The overall score doesn't have the same haunting quality as it did in IWTV, but the violin parts are quite good (that's another character I miss... Nicolas!).The rock star worship bits are good fun, and Townsend mugs and prances with aplomb. The jaded journalists take it all in stride when Lestat announces at a press conference that he's the real deal (he looks less freakish than Alice Cooper, Kiss, or Marilyn Manson, after all). At the big Death Valley concert (a great location change from the original setting), gothy fans scream and stomp enthusiastically, unaware that they're watching not a theatrical concert but a battle to the death among the undead. Budgetary constraints probably came into play here, but I preferred how in the book, Lestat incorporated effigies of Akasha and totems of Ancient Egypt into his act. He's just a straight-ahead rocker with smoke machines in the movie.The showdown at the end of the film takes pure artistic license, and is too pat. But, the filmmakers tried to pack too much into a too-short movie while at the same time taking out great chunks of the core story. Lestat the rock star, the vengeful Queen, the inquisitive Talamascans, the guardian Maharet, or any of the bits and pieces touched upon could have been beefed up. I think that once the rights drift back into the market, it should be made into a mini-series. It could even be a regular series, ala Dark Shadows. The Vampire Chronicles are very episodic anyway -- it's the perfect medium if you ask me.And while you're asking me, don't ask why the film got an R-rating. I sure can't figure it out. There's no nudity, no overly repulsive gore (except when Akasha noshes on the heart of a vampire -- wet and bloody at first, it turns to dust as its owner perishes), and no profane language. Queen of the Darned would be more like it.Unfortunately, there isn't any heat, R-rated or otherwise, between the characters. I still get tingles when I think of certain quietly erotic moments in IWTV, or the chemistry between Winona Ryder and Gary Oldman in Dracula, but there is none of that in QOTD. Not even when there should have been -- the stage is set for a really sizzling love scene when Lestat and Akasha share a rose-petal soak (nose-thumb to Wes Bentley here?) together, but it's as tepid as their bathwater.

Upon viewing the trailer for &#145;Queen of the Damned', one would assume that since it boasted the late singer Aaliyah's final film debut, she would have quite the predominant role. Yet how presumptuous would be to assume that. For it is not the case, the singer's scenes in the film have been unevenly slashed since her death and she appears mostly in the final stages of the film. Yet, that is not to say that the film revolves around her character, for she is the titular character, but actor Stuart Townsend owns the film     In this apparent sequel to &#145;Interview With the Vampire', Townsend portrays the character Tom Cruise made famous in the former film. In this Gen-X film, Lestat returns after a century of sleep only to find himself bored with immortality. Thus making way for Akasha, a 6000-year-old Queen Vampire who promises him much more than he could ever imagine.      I must admit, expectations were low coming into this film. I am not an avid horror fan and do not find myself caring much for films of this caliber, yet many surprises were in hand upon the viewing of the film. Released by Warner Brothers, the film was certainly modestly budgeted but contained some great production values. The settings were elegant and the film captured a seemingly eerie yet graceful aura that did not make this film seem something it was not. Perhaps a borderline thriller, the film rarely makes an attempt to terrify. Yet tells a story of a vampire who awakens an ancient evil in order to search for more.      The film opens in an interesting manner and makes us realize that we should take this film a little more seriously than at first glance. Lestat returns only to find himself in a rock Band and while the public thinks his Vampire gimmick is a front; Lestat has other plans that are conveyed by Townsend decadently immersing himself in the role of the lustful and bloodthirsty vampire.       Director Michael Rymer (Perfume, In Too Deep) is at the helm of what appears to be his first mainstream film and certainly surprises. Though the script may be quite weak, and the visual effects may also be characterized as ordinary, the discerning viewer will notice a solid attempt at creating a haunting and at times enchanting tale about a vampire's quest for something that just might be unable to achieve.       The film certainly has its' flaws, if dissected; the objective viewer will note the pacing will be a tad bland at times and many things seem to be too convenient. Yet the film does have an interesting cast including a surprisingly elegant and masterful French actor Vincent Perez as Lestat's mentor Marias. Lena Olin also joins the cast as the watchful aunt of Jessie (Marguerite Moreau), a fanatical Vampire Scholar who will stop at nothing at discovering the secrets of the nocturnal.       As aforementioned, I was quite surprised at the outcome of the film.  Based on Anne Rice's follow up Novel to &#145;Interview With the Vampire', the same sensual and erotic themes are contained within the film yet are handed gracefully.  The film does not turn itself into a soft porn romp, but neither does it connect the sensuality to the cause. This in my view is one of the main conflicts within the film. The sensual undertones seem to be overshadowed by the film's explicit attempts to woo us with its' style and appeal.       Furthermore, the film seems to be gearing itself towards a Gen-X audience. How can one tell? Listen to the soundtrack, heavy metal tracks bombard the viewer in the film and makes an attempt to connect to the grunge attitude encompassing the present day world. Yet, in relation to poorer films that have the same target audience, this film escapes the trap without the slightest pretense.  Instead of overflowing itself with stupidity that it could have easily engulfed itself in, the film is embedded with an ambitious, admirable and tender eye that Rymer brings to the film. Is it the best film out there? No. Is it the best Vampire film? Leave that to &#145;The Lost Boys'. Just enjoy this film for what it is; a matinee-like thriller that looks great and that may surprise many.Giancarlo's Rating **  "},{"Title":"Not that bad, but not that great either.","Date":"20 February 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  I saw this film last night at a free sneak preview. I have to say that while I was entertained, there were some things about the film I did not like.1) The acting is sub-par all around.

Considering that these two are the top-billed cast members should prepare you for the lackluster performances from the rest of the cast.2) I have never read any of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles so I don't know what specifically was cut out for the screenplay. What I do know is that they obviously cut out too much. There is too much that is not explained adequately on screen. It was plainly apparent that many sub-plots had been deleted, and therefore, a lot of potential was wasted.3) The score, in several places, became an annoyance as the music dramatically elevated to a piercing screech that only made me wince in pain.4) The eye makeup of the vampires in the movie made me wonder how they have managed to stay secret for so long, being that they all look alike. They all had the exact same discoloration at the corners of their eyes (near the nose). Visually, it was very distracting and failed at making the vampires look otherworldly - it looked more like that crud that forms in the corners of your eyes while you're sleeping.Now, all that being said I feel the movie is not a complete waste of time. Aaliya, while not a great actress, is certainly pleasing to the eye. And there is enough action and special effects to keep the lukewarm plot going until the end.

His Crow-like appearance and silly Bela Lugosi-esque accent come off as humorous. Marguerite Moreau (Wet Hot American Summer) isn't bad as Lestat's love interest/obsessive fan. Aaliyah gives a strong performance, but is only in about less than a third of the movie. Apparently, this is not due to her untimely death. The redubs on her vocals were actually done by her brother in post-production.  This film was supposed to go straight to video and really should have. It probably won't do well as soon as the bad word spreads. Anne Rice fans will be very disappointed and most horror film buffs will have a hard time getting into this one.

Which leaves the nicely shot and designed film as just another CGI pretty-picture fest sans any great narrative momentum, let alone character development. Stuart Townsend has a nice insolent-sexy vibe as Lestat, and Vincent Perez seems to be enjoying himself as Marius. Aaliyah mostly acts with her hips--you'll know what I mean when you see the film--though in her defense it should be said she's not required to do much more than be an FX-assisted slinky image. It's nice to see Paul McGann and Lena Olin in a mainstream film, undistinguished though their roles are. A major minus, however, is Marguerite Moreau as mortal ingenue Jesse--she's so lacking in charisma and personality you might suspect she was cast through some sort of behind-the-scenes nepotism. (Presumably it wasn't because her work in all three Mighty Ducks films was so memorable...not that I'd know, anyway.) By not taking itself too seriously (while on the other hand resisting outright camp), the movie does get away with the potentially hypersilly vampire-as-rock-star conceit; at a first listen, the Jonathan Davis-penned/sung songs are serviceable. But in the end this is just another good-looking piecing together of music-video-like setpieces that are amusing enough in themselves yet never add up to potent storytelling or a cogent atmosphere.

It seems as if quite a lot of people didn't really like this movie and I suspect one of the reasons that this was the case was because they changed the lead actor, but then again I did find Townsend preferable to Cruise. Plotwise, well I doubt that it could be much of an improvement on the first one, which did not seem to have a plot either, but also this movie is basically compressing two books into one so the plot was always going to suffer.Basically Lestat has been asleep for about a hundred years (since the end of the last movie) and has recently awakened to discover a new world, however he is still alone, so he decides to join a rock band and openly display the fact that he is a vampire, not that he would be considered a freak considering that he is moving about in the Gothic world of the 1990s.Then there is a young woman whose auntie turns out to be a vampire as well, and she has some special telekinetic powers that enables her to, well, I'm not exactly sure what, but she seems to be torn between becoming a vampire and not becoming a vampire. She is also a part of a secret society that monitors and records the paranormal activities, which includes vampires.We learn about Lestat's past, and that he stumbled across the statue (but is it really a statue) of the prime vampire known as the Queen of the Damned, and he also discovers that music has a tendency to awaken her, which is probably why he started a rock band (or at least joined one) because he did know that music awakens her, and what better way to summon her than through Gothic rock music.To me this was an okay movie, but the thing that I did really like about it was the sound track. One does wonder if a sound track really does make the movie. I guess it can make a bad movie bearable, but then again so does a short length.

Was Akasha not enough for our apparently homophobic screenwriter? Thankfully, at the very least, she is a more compelling villainess than in the books, where she was nothing more than a maniacal feminazi, and Aaliyah does give a compelling performance...for the twenty or so minutes of screen time she has.Pacing is probably the largest problem with this film, as too much time is taken with attempting to showcase the frankly awful music that Lestat and his band make. One imagines they desperately needed the gimmick of him claiming to be a vampire, as otherwise few would have even paid attention to the melodically bereft noise they generated. This time would have been much better spent developing the character of Akasha, trying to make Lestat even remotely likable or sympathetic, or adding some form of coherency to Jesse's bare-bones backstory. Viewers may complain about Akasha being too over-the-top, but what else could she do when the script refused to give her any development whatsoever? All she could do was present herself as a would-be conqueror. And at the very least, she had more screen presence than any of the rest of the unfortunate cast.Lestat came off as a poseur, a douchebag, and a completely unsympathetic, unlikable character. The audience were supposed to be concerned, several times, when it seemed he would be destroyed by 'evil vampires', yet the film failed to make him anything but annoying, selfish, and pedestrian. This was not helped by Stuart Townsend's weak performance and inconstant accent, nor was it helped by the fact that the makeup department dropped the ball on several shots where he was clearly supposed to be powdered and made up to be deathly pale, yet was not. Visual appeal was all he had, and several times that failed.Jesse was nothing but a cipher, as transparent an audience insertion character as could be. Her story could have been made interesting, but the audience was asked to make too many leaps of logic that would have been better developed by the film itself.In fact, that in many ways is the greatest problem with the film it makes no sense at all, leaps around constantly, and never ends up with any logical coherency. I find it problematic that Rice's vampires always kill their prey (but inexplicably not the last drop) because that would be like taking an apple from a huge apple tree and then cutting the tree down and throwing the rest away. I don't have a problem with vampires out during the daylight because even the original fictional vampire, Carmilla, could do this. Akasha being out in the day wasn't a problem I had. It was the rest of the story that constantly failed.I repeatedly found myself asking 'what?' and 'how does that even work?' in this film. People turning to statues for no reason...people suddenly being in one place or another without any explanation...some clandestine organisation of extremely bored presumed researchers who never do anything...a temple in the middle of the desert that has no real reason for existing...what does it all mean? Wouldn't the vampires attacking Lestat right when he calls them out call more attention to them than his divulging of supposed secrets? More likely it would seem they'd just ignore him and everyone would assume he's just another second-rate goth demagogue looking for attention. Why would Marius try to hide something behind an easily-uncovered passage from his sensory-enhanced scion, then blithely leave him alone, presuming he wouldn't uncover it? Why would Jesse be chosen as one of the fans to see Lestat, not even remotely looking the part? How is it possible that Lestat managed to cover up the dead bodies of the people he ate, especially after telling everyone he's a vampire? Wouldn't the police kind of find it suspicious that dead, blood-drained bodies had been showing up wherever he went? Wasn't he supposed to feed only from killers and the morally bereft, instead of just any and every tart brought to him? Everything on the story hinges on tremendous coincidence, with inadequate plausible premise presented.Along with the problematic title -- which seems to indicate more that Lestat himself is the queen of the damned, and quite a queen he is -- the whole thing is just a huge mess.And you can't expect me to believe that they couldn't afford to get someone to walk on for five minutes at the end as Louis, for some small modicum of continuity. Maybe if they had used, I don't know, 500 less extras, they could've afforded at least a decent actor to give it something of a satisfactory conclusion.But no, they didn't even do that. At the end of it all, it was a big ho-hum where nothing much happened and what did happen was completely confusing and incoherent. It's annoying enough that Anne Rice is regarded as such a go-to person for vampires (though perhaps not anymore as she's become a tad bonkers), even more annoying when people use her work as so much window-dressing and actually manage to make a much worse story.

It messed with and compressed/redid the Anne Rice novels so much that few people seem to like it - but I think if you go into without expecting it to be Anne Rice's Lestat, but rather a story loosely inspired by her books, it's a decent little goth movie.Particularly Queen/Damned's music, by guys from Korn, Static X and even Marilyn Manson (who has one great album, Mechanical Animals, his Ziggy Stardust glam tribute/ripoff), and Stuart Townsend as Lestat. While no Tom Cruise, he's a lot better than you'd expect, and certainly believable as a rock star.As surprisingly dynamic as Cruise was in Interview/Vampire, there's no WAY he could have done the rock star turn without making everyone laugh while remembering the tightie whitey dance from Risky Business!

I enjoyed Interview with the Vampire, and was hoping for a film on the same level. However I was let down. The storyline of the movie was completely skewered from the novel, and failed to adequately touch up on the book's main themes. The acting wasn't the worst, as there were some good performances out there, particularly those by the actors portraying Marius and Lestat. However the failures of the film were the lack of character development and skimming of important details of the book which translated into a jumbled mess. For example there was no mention of the Legend of the Red Headed twins and no insight into the history of the Queen Akasha. If you are going to make a movie of the Queen of the Damned, then you better put her on the screen more and develop her history or her motives. While interweaving a whole novel's content into a 90 minute film is challenging, it's like the producers/directors didn't read the book but settled for the Cliff Notes version. In the end, the film is merely entertainment for those who have NOT read the book and pure folly for those who are avid readers of the Vampire Chronicles. I will see this movie only once but will read the book many, many times.

It is a big guilty pleasure of mine, but I will grant that now reading most of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles and I also will grant that it about as faithful to them as 300 was to history, but once you put the books aside and forget all about them, it's a decent film to say the least.Many fans have despised this film for butchering the books and some actually enjoy it because it had introduced them to the books in the first place (as it did to me), but personally I think it would have done a good job as a film if it was just in chronological order and faithful to the book. For example, Stuart Townsend has been criticized for is performance as he wasn't playing the character of Lestat from the books. Frankly, I think Townsend could have played a good Lestat if he wanted to, seeing him in other films where he had done a good job, but clearly the writers had different ideas. Needless to say, the film would have been good if it had either a different title and different names or was at least faithful to the book. But apparently, the writers had only looked up a fair few pages of the books and thought that was a good idea.But there are some good points to the film The soundtrack is brilliant, Vincent Perez (Marius) appears to be the only one in character, Lena Olin is wonderful as Maharet (despite her lack of blindness, let alone a twin sister) and although Townsend does not play the twisted and humorous side of Lestat, he does add the seduction, arrogance and edginess that Tom Cruise did not have. After all, it might be hard to take Tom Cruise seriously as a rock star lip- syncing to Korn, though he did do a brilliant job in the original first installment of the chronicles on film. And to my astonishment, I watched the film in French for practice not too long ago and Lestat was a lot more in character when dubbed in French...very strange.Anyhow, yes, on a whole the film does little to no justice to the books, but it is enjoyable if you're bored and in need of something semi-dark or if you're in need of an introduction to the books to get a taste of what they're like. Although, the books, to me, are almost unfilmable since they are filled with rather heavy metaphysical matters.

Unlike its pretentious predecessor, director Neil Jordan's uneven but atmospheric Interview With A Vampire (1994), Queen doesn't meander around with morbid melodramatics. Instead, this lightweight but entertaining epic about immortal bloodsuckers on the prowl isn't so much a straight-line sequel as an autonomous adaptation of Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles. Actually, Queen shares more in common with Stephen Norrington's bloodthirsty Blade (1998) with its accent on heretical hemoglobin hunters who refuse to abide by Dracula's discretionary daylight dictates. Like the nefarious Nosferatus in Blade, the creepiest of the cryptmeisters in Queen not only wants to come out of the coffin forever but also dine on humans until doomsday. Anybody who saw Interview knows Lestat (Tom Cruise) emerged as the world's fiercest fangster. Thoroughly evil, he lacked a single redeeming feature. In Queen, Australian director Michael Rymer and scenarists Scott Abbott & Michael Petroni have reimagined the lecherous Lestat, so he appears comparably saintly, more like Brad Pitt's bloodsucker in Interview. As the action unfolds, Lestat has been mildewing in his mausoleum for 200 years, because he found immortality by himself a colossal bore. We learn in Queen, for instance, that a 400-year-old vampire called Marius (Vincent Perez of The Crow 2 City of Angels) kidnapped Lestat and turned the 18th century French nobleman into a vampire. Vampires amount to a gregarious group in this big screen incarnation. Like the rebellious young Kirsten Dunst character in Interview, Lestat ventures where he shouldn't have and takes a forbidden bite out of Akasha, the Queen of all vampires. Marius had Akasha's petrified corpse locked up for all eternity in the cellar of his magnificent castle. Anyway, Marius vanishes with Akasha, leaving poor Lestat to fend for himself. Depressed, Lestat retires to his crypt, until the melodic strains of rock'n roll serenade him back to the 'live' side. Exposing himself to the world-at-large as a real-life vampire, Lestat forms his own heavy metal band and gets his picture on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine. Principally, his fellow fangsters hate him, because he revealed their secret existence. Meanwhile, a British babe named Jesse (Marguerite Moreau) who serves as an apprentice for a cloistered clique called the Talamascans, paranormal people who keep tabs on vampires but refuse to interfere with them, wants to meet Lestat. She heard one of his hit tunes, and it turned her on! Jesse's mentor David Talbot (Paul McGann, a one-time Dr. Who) warns her to leave well enough alone, as does her distant vampire auntie Maharet (Lena Olin). Of course, Jesse listens to neither and runs afoul of the evil Akasha.Like the best vampire outings, Queen of the Damned never takes itself seriously, offers something new for audiences, and climaxes with an exciting, slam-bang, action-packed finale.

Aaliyah did a pretty good job, I think she got the feel of the character, but at the same time there was something missing. Keep in mind though Aaliyah was a singer trying out acting not a professional actress. Some of the lines where a little too predictable and stupid which over all just made the movie way too corny at parts when it really didn't need to be at all. I loved the movie soundtrack, I am a big fan of Korn, Deftones, and Static-X, Jonathan Davis did a good job composing the songs they had a believable feel that this is what a vampire who was bored with immortality and didn't care anymore would write about. They probably should not of had Davis sing for Lesat though his voice is just too recognizable it made way to obvious that Townsend wasn't singing.

She only appeared in the last part of the movie and did some flashy stuff there was no depth in the story. The movie seemed rushed. I guess this is because it was two books in one. Which I thought was a real pity. I have seen Interview with a vampire and I liked it because the movie seemed to have many complete stories in one. Also it worked my emotions. I especially can remember how angry i was at a certain point of that movie. This movie on the other hand seemed to lack any kind of storyline at all. There was no suspense in the movie.

Considering the film is only 97 minutes long i'd say they did quite well with the plot but it could have been soooo much better. My main suggestion for improvement is to stick more closely to the books because they are excellent. The description and dialogue in the books is so much more detailed than in the movie. in the movie its cut so much if you haven't read the books you barely know whats happening. in the film the character of Jesse has too big a part and too little a point, she actually has a point in the book. they should have either included more of Lestats history or made 2 separate films, The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned because there is simply too much story to be told in 97 minutes. Lestat should not be made by Marius and the legend of the twins should be included and most importantly Mekare, Maharets twin sister. the demise of Akasha was so much better when Mekare killed her and became the new queen of the damned. the merging of characters in this part was the worst mistake the film makers could make in my opinion. i really hope someone does this again in the near future but hopefully a new one would be more accurate. on a positive note Aaliyahs portrayal of Akasha was great because of her i don't care what you want approach to the other vampires. overall good viewing but don't take it too seriously or you will just get confused.

It has to be said that Stuart Townsend doesn't look anything like the Lestat described by Anne Rice but he does however pull it off very well.

In fact, I avoided the movie treatment of Interview With the Vampire for a number of years, first--because I was doubtful that it would translate well from page to screen, and second--because I thought that the cast they chose were absolutely wrong. After recently watching Interview for the first time, my suspicions were confirmed--it was simply an abomination. For some reason, I wasn't as concerned about Queen of the Damned being made into a movie, even though it happened to be my favorite book in the series. Knowing that it was going to suffer in translation made me less apprehensive about it, and I was able to enjoy it for what it is--a spirited vampire romp. Inaccurate, but quite enjoyable.Before I watched it, I had no idea that the filmmakers decided to combine The Vampire Lestat with Queen of the Damned, Therein lay its primary structural problem. Condensing hundreds of pages of a single book's text--action, dialogue, inner monologues and descriptive prose--into a 100 minute movie is limiting enough, but to attempt it with TWO books was a serious mistake. It made Akasha into a relatively minor character, with very little background, little humanity and unclear motivation. Aaliyah was physically very good in the role (she could move very well, and her face is quite expressive), even if her acting performance was rather broad. But the good news is that--as Lestat--Stuart Townsend is light years better than Tom Cruise (but then, so would be any one of 100 other actors). Not only is his acting range much wider than Cruise, and his skill and subtlety much deeper, he is also much closer to the Lestat that was in my head as I read the books. Sure, he's narcissistic and tragic and conflicted, but he doesn't need to chew up the scenery (a la Cruise) to get that across to the audience. Townsend manages something that Tom Cruise never could an appealing enigma. An inspired choice! Vincent Perez turned in a good, understated performance as Marius, but I thought that Marguerite Moreau's acting was skilled, if a little TOO understated; at times, she seemed ennervated. Most of the rest of the cast members had too little time on-screen to really connect with the audience, but I must say that Paul McGann as David Talbot--the leader of the Talamasca--was flawless! When I first saw him, I thought he was Gabriel Byrne (who is surely one of the most gifted actors around). But McGann steals every scene he's in--not by acting up a storm, but by being fascinating to watch. A great actor to keep an eye on. I have to mention the special effects of Queen of the Damned; they are SPECTACULAR. I have a low tolerance for heavy-handed computerized effects, and thankfully, QotD avoids that trap, for effects that LOOK analogue (even if they are digital). There are at least 3 events in the film that left my jaw somewhere on the floor with how astoundingly good the effects were. I wish the special effects of all recent horror films were so good!I do wish there had been more sexy scenes in Queen of the Damned. Rice's books are teeming with sensuality, so I was rather surprised to find only two scenes even remotely sexy (Lestat and Akasha in the flowerpetal-strewn tub, and Lestat and Jessie at the Mt. Palomar Observatory). Due to the pacing, there was little chance for any other really sensuous moments, which was a shame, really. And the fact that they decided to try to pack so much of two books into a single movie simultaneously thwarted the expectations of many Anne Rice fans, while probably leaving those unfamiliar with the books scratching their heads about background, motivation and character development. Nevertheless, for those willing to approach the film with the right mindset, Queen of the Damned is a damned good vampire movie.

For a vampire it must be quite a frustrating experience to live forever.  Exactly how many different things can you do with eternity before you begin to get sick and tired of the enigmatic life?  This in a nutshell is what drives the vampire Lestat out of hiding and into the limelight.  In a complete bipolar opposite move and as a cathartic release for his rebellious emotions, Lestat joins a band and becomes an international rock star.  He does not attempt to hide his identity, rather he shouts it out to all the public in an attempt to rouse and anger other members of the vampire clan to come out of hiding.  But exactly who he wakes up in particular is of grave importance - Akasha (Aaliyah), queen of all vampires (hence the title).What make her different (spoiler!) is that as the most pure of vampires, she can walk in the daylight and can set her enemies bursting into flames at will.  Her evil is as limitless as her hunger for blood.  What more perfect a match than Akasha and Lestat?But the joining of the two morbid souls leaves Lestat looking like a altarboy by comparison.  Akasha's darkness threatens to destroy all the world, humans and vampires.  Meanwhile, Jesse, a member of the Telamusque (vampire observation group), has become fascinated with Lestat and the mysterious of vampires.  She pursues Lestat in an attempt to become one of the undead.The battle for vampires and humans remains in jeopardy under Akasha's rule.  Aaliyah's acting abilities are remarkable in one of her final performances and Stuart Townsend's portrayal as the new-celebrity Lestat is exceptional.  The film carries well amid a macabre metal soundtrack appropriate to the plot (similar to The Crow soundtrack's theme).

Making an adaptation is making choices, and QOTD is an harder book to adapt that the rest of the Vampire Chronicles, because it's story is more complicated. The principal argument of Interview with the Vampire was that the vampire has to live with the current time, not with past. The adaptation choice results from that Lestat is no longer a romantic character, he now live in another time, where all is fake and superficial.

The movie should have been titled The Vampire Lestat; it would have been more appropriate.  I'm also sick of the tortured soul quality in vampire flicks.  They turned Lestat into Louie from the first film because he hates his existence.  Why then does he not just walk out into the sunlight?  To quote Tom Cruise I'm sick of this incessant whining.  Queen of the Damned is just another corny vampire melodrama.

Not qualities one would usually associate with the supposed vampire queen. The special effects were both bad and good depending on the scene.

As a film, it is weak with only a few snippets of real effort; the actors, as good as some of them are, were given so little to work with that their efforts are fruitless.  As an adaptation, it is sloppy and self-serving, unfaithful and derivative of the earlier, much better Interview with the Vampire.The movie has mere moments of potential. It updates the story a little, of course, from the early-mid eighties to present-day, which works in terms of music. Lestat would fit in well with the goth-rock scene. Townsend isn't abominable as Lestat, though he's certainly not got the grip on the character that Tom Cruise had. There's no evidence that he read the novels beyond the way he holds his violin.The Jesse character is badly, horribly done in the movie. She comes off as much less philosophical and obsessed, and more like she's simply attracted to Lestat. On the contrary, she was fascinated by his world, because it echoed something more important to her. Her relationship with her aunt Maharet is done an injustice because the movie can't decide if it is about Lestat or about Jesse.Or about Akasha.Aaliyah had potential as an actress, but this was miscasting if it ever happens.  First, Akasha and Maharet would have been about the same age when turned, so having Aaliyah and Lena Olin (who does a good job with what little, very little, she's given) is just sloppy. Second, Akasha isn't a power-drunk whore, she's a demented vampire goddess. She was a crafty and wicked queen of Egypt.  Aaliyah seems to be lost, acting more as if she's in a music video than in a film, and her most convincing moments in character are when she does not speak or move.Don't get me started on Marius.  Vincent Perez isn't a terrible choice, but he can't quite decide if his character is cruel or fatherly.  In reality he was neither, but again, there is no evidence that he read the novels, and less evidence that the writers did.Like I said, the film had moments. Jesse's first encounter with Lestat is well-done. And this movie got the blood tears right. The music and the frenzy that Lestat causes was also well-done. His love-hate relationship with Marius was there, though it was weak, and it was bastardized (Marius did not make Lestat, for instance).Overall, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth, not only for the book-to-movie reasons, but also because there were sloppy filmmaking elements as well. Choppy plot, chiefly. Introduction of important characters too late in the film, and some bad directing to boot. Bad acting? Eh, not really, but it was sometimes hard to tell.I can't say I'd recommend this to anyone, ever. It doesn't even stand up as a decent *vampire* movie separate from the books (like Interview does in Neil Jordan's capable hands).

After viewing it there were so many questions running through my mind that it was almost impossible to write this. How could Interview with the Vampire be followed up like this? How could such disgrace be brought to the name of Anne Rice? And what exactly was the motive behind making this film? Being based on the third book in Rice's ever so popular Vampire Chronicles (Interview with the Vampire being the first) it is one big mess from start to finish. The film opens with the awakening or resurrection of the now world famous vampire Lestate. It is never explained why he wakes but we are told that he felt that something in the world had changed and now everything was better. Putting this scene into context one would realize that this makes no sense at all since the last time we saw Lestate in 1994 he was awake and well. Upon he entry back into humanity he decides to join a rock band, defying the vampire code by taking himself public. Now we meet Jesse, a girl who studies the supernatural. She becomes drawn to Lestate due to a reoccurring childhood memory/nightmare or something like that, details on this are sketchy as well. Within the first hour of the film we have a division. In one corner we have the whole rock star, fall in love with Jesse story. That is than intercepted and the second half of the first half begins (confused yet?). This takes place in a flashback that runs for about half an hour and lasts about 15 minutes to long. Here we see Lestate being turned into a vampire by another vampire named Morius. It is here that we also get our first glimpse of the title character (Queen Akasha). Finally after an hour that seems like an eternity (vampire pun intended) we finally get to see Queen Akasha in the flesh, get a good look at her now folks because she is only on screen for a total of around fifteen minutes in the entire film. I guess the death of Aaliyah really effect the outcome of this film because she is given the smallest amount of time that I have ever seen a lead role given. Akasha is the queen of everything damned and her mission is to make Lestate one of her own, for all you non-vampire readers the simple way of putting it would be to have sex with him. Of course this causes trouble to break out because we have Jesse wanting Lestate, Marius wanting Lestate, Akasha wanting Lestate, a crowd full of gothic teens wanting Lestate and some other vampires wanting Lestate dead for giving away their vampire secrets. During this period of time we encounter another spilt (I can see everyone clenching their forehead in pain already). This time though it doesn't occur in story but rather in character. Here anything human is dismissed and all remaining characters are divided into good vampires and bad vampires. This story is almost impossible to follow and upon closer inspection makes not the least bit of sense. Stuart Townsend plays Lestate, and I must say he must have had a friend in a high place because he is not fit for his role at all, especially since his feet are filling the enormous shoes of Tom Cruise who gave such an accurate performance in Interview with the Vampire it was almost scary. Although the late Aaliyah was a talented young lady and even though it seems like she is having loads of fun, she is also all wrong for her role due to the fact that for a queen of everything damned she is not all that threatening. Director Michael Rhymer seems like he would rather give the audience a headache than a thrill and that is just what he does. The camera is all over the place and he also threw in some horrible computer generated effects to symbolize the movement of a vampire. The script however is a very interesting one because never once does it have any idea where it wants to be, what it wants to do or how it's going to do it. It starts off like a bit of social commentary about what fame will do to a man (or vampire) and what kind of of impact the media and image have on the youth of today. The only problem with that is I don't find anything believable about a vampire waking from his long sleep and becoming one of the biggest names in music over night. The film then skyrockets into a downward spiral of complete trash. In a world where vampire films are supposed to be thrilling, erotic and oozing with sexuality this is nothing more than a trashy version of Interview with the Vampire (which was all those things). It has been made for teens with pierced eyebrows and Marilyn Manson t-shirts. I firmly believe that somewhere in the world, as we speak, someone is hailing this as a masterpiece of modern vampire erotica. I'll even bet it is somewhere in France. The soundtrack to this film sees Korn front man Jonathan Davis providing the vocals for Lestate's onstage presence. There are several problems with this. For one thing Townsend is not good at acting like a rock star, he prances around the stage and never once is able to mimic Davis' voice. The next problem is that Davis' voice fits Townsend about as well as the glove fit O.J., it just doesn't work at all. The third, and final problem is that being a vampire Lestate is a dark, sexual figure so you would think he would sing creepy yet erotic songs. I think this is what Davis was going for but the thing is Davis' voice is neither creepy or erotic, it is whiney and annoying, Marilyn Manson would have been a better choice for the voice work. It has been a long time since I have seen a horror film (a vampire one especially) that has nothing to be desired. The acting is bad, the direction is bad, the script is bad and it doesn't even remotely resemble anything scary or sexy. There has been so many films based on vampires that they have almost started their own genre, and although most of them are not worth the price of admission even the really bad ones have some redeeming qualities. Blade 2 started off with a pulse-racing action sequence, Bram Stoker's Dracula was beautiful to look at and John Carpenter's Vampires has James Woods perfectly cast in the lead role. This films ha absolutely nothing going for it, it is ugly, it is dark, it is dirty, it is confusing and it is boring. After watching this film see how much you can remember about it after waking up the next day, my bet will be placed on very little. In a genre that needs a strong A+ this one is a D- at best, do yourself a favour and stick with Interview with the Vampire, you will thank yourself.

Trailers and TV spots for QUEEN OF THE DAMNED spotlight Aaliyah's performance, and give us the impression that the movie is all about her.  Truth be told, it's not.  The beautiful singer takes up a mere 20 minutes or so of footage, in a film that focuses primarily on Lestat, played by Stuart Townsend.  Now that you know not to expect too much from Aaliyah, let's discuss what we're given.  Townsend's Lestat character, as we learn in a series of flashbacks, was once a noble Englishman.  He met a man named Marius, played by Vincent Perez, who turned out to be a vampire.  Marius chose Lestat as a pupil, hoping to train him as a proper vampire.  But Lestat's curiosity and rebellious nature get him into trouble, and Marius soon realizes that his protégé may not be properly prepared for what lies ahead.  After discovering a mysterious Egyptian statue, hidden away beneath Marius' castle, Lestat goes through a series of events that leave him passed out.  I'm being vague to keep from spoiling it all.  Upon waking he finds the statue gone, along with Marius.  Thus begins a mystery that will stay with Lestat for hundreds of years, until he wakes from a long sleep, and is now in the present.  This is actually where the film opens, and let the silliness begin!  Of all the things that could wake Lestat, rock music wins the prize.  He comes out of his slumber, quickly meets a Goth garage band, and makes them his children.  Lestat becomes their master, and the lead singer of the band, propelling it to superstar status.  Ironically he uses his vampire persona as a character for promotional sake.  The public eats it up, assuming it's all an act.  Through his music and press conferences, Lestat calls out all vampires by divulging secrets, and challenging others to fight him.  I'm not making any of this up by the way.  Marguerite Moreau plays a humble vampire observer named Jesse, who comes from her own troubled past, and becomes intrigued with Lestat.  Her fascination leads her toward him, and conveniently allows her to get close to this seemingly untouchable rock star.  As the other vampires of the world grow angry, Queen Akasha (the mysterious statue from Marius' castle) returns to earth, letting all know she's a force to be reckoned with.QUEEN OF THE DAMNED is a disjointed stylish mess.  It's pretty enough to appreciate on some level, but silly enough to make you laugh at it's mediocrity. The biggest problem lies in it's all too serious tone.  The heavy handed dialogue and over-dramatic posturing ultimately lead to it's defeat.  Even Aaliyah, who shines with her sexy performance, can't hope to save this.  Stewart Townsend plays Lestat gracefully enough, but doesn't seen to have the kind of emotion we would expect from someone with his past.  Moreau's Jesse character is just plain boring, and makes me wonder why her fellow vampire observers don't seem to do anything aside from observing.  The other actors here don't really seem to know quite what to do, not that they're given much to work with.  FARSCAPE fans may notice Claudia Black as a background vampire, who has no character development whatsoever. This film is obviously a vampire flick for the MTV generation, which makes me wonder even more why there's so few laughs and so little action.  Their target audience doesn't want this, though it's a small step in the right direction.  What QUEEN needs most is a sense of humor.  Horror films these days can't take themselves too serious without the chance of becoming a joke.  Aaliyah's limited screen time is very disappointing, and it's a shame this had to be her final performance.  Vampire fans and Goth folk will find a few perks here, but can ultimately expect to be let down by the overall result.  In this day of high expectations from filmgoers, it's surprising that studios won't put more thought into what works and why.  QUEEN OF THE DAMNED falls very short of it's potential.  The more I think about it, the less I like it.  To each his own I guess. On a scale of ONE to TEN, 10 being the best, I give QUEEN OF THE DAMNED a 5.

Authors are able to expand on things, and keep certain plot points going that a movie cannot do, because movie audiences have NO patience with the films that they watch.  Disney changes EVERYTHING that they get their greedy little hands on, yet there are few complaints where they come in.  A case in point is the Three Musketeers move they made.  So many liberties were taken, the only thing the movie got right was the names of the characters.  Yet, the movie is still enjoyable.Now folks, let me say that I am an avid reader myself, and I have all of Anne Rice's novel.  But I am also a big movie watcher, and I have realized that to compare books to film is unfair to both the author and the crew that make the film.  You see, Hollywood constantly takes stories from books, and is always forced to delete certain things from the book, to make a story short enough to fit into a certain length of time.  It always happens, and if you continually hold it to the book, then you won't see the forest for the trees.And yes, this movie is based from both books The Vampire Lestat and the Queen of the Damned.  Well, what did you expect?  They had only made Interview With the Vampire, and the Lestat novel was the sequel to that, so they had to bridge that gap somehow.After watching this movie, I happen to think that it is one of the better vampire movies ever made, most certainly in the top 5.  The characters were well acted, and the essence of the characterization that you fell in the books IS present.  And this is how Lestat was meant to be portrayed, not the less than scary Tom Cruise performance.  If you can let go of the book, you'll see a great movie, despite the liberties that they took.  It's a visual masterpiece on the same wavelength of the Crow, it's wonderfully acted, and it had a great soundtrack to boot.  If you hate it, it's cause you're stuck in the library.

The result was a pleasing picture that had a lot of symbolism that allowed you to associate it with the appropriate story. By no means was a single picture meant to tell the story in an intelligible way. That's pretty much what they've done with this movie. It is a series of music videos featuring some of the same characters, themes and symbolism from Anne Rice's Vampire chronicles. But it does not even attempt to tell the story in some kind of intelligible way.Overall, I think it succeeds in looking cool, sounding great and conveying flashes of the much deeper storyline from the books. Could it have been done better? Perhaps, but in my opinion, you could have made a 2 hour movie about David Talbot. Trying to cram even a fraction of the story from the books into a movie would be folly. Maybe they were better off not even trying. That said, I can't imagine how anyone who has not read the books could follow the movie at all. It must seem incredibly jumbled and disjointed.By the way, I loved Stuart Townsend as Lestat. I saw Interview before reading any of the books. At that time I thought that Tom Cruise was just fine as Lestat. After reading the books, I hated Cruise's portrayal. Townsend shows just the right amount of detachment, glee and remorse over the mayhem that he is a part of. He is alternatively, a stalking cat, an unblinking viper and a wounded and bleeding little boy, sometimes all three in the same scene.

A simple fun movie for those of us out there who can handle a movie with little meaning and can allow ourselves to dumb down for a little just to enjoy some beautiful people and sights, without needing great dialogue or intricate plot.

You'd think any studio would jump at the chance to have the creator of their film subject write the script at no charge. What did these pillars of genius do?  They turned her down!  THEY TURNED ANNE RICE DOWN!  And the film suffered for it.In no way is this a Vampire Chronicles movie.  In no way is this a good movie.  In no way is this even a mediocre movie.  The plot was hollow, as where the characters (who in no way resembled those from the books). Townsend is no Lestat.  Aaliyah was definitly NOT Akasha.  From what I saw, the only ones who liked this movie were those fans of the late singer. People would get up and cheer when she came on the screen.  But fans of Anne Rice would groan and complain.  That's who this movie should've been made for.  Instead it came off as an Aaliyah-vehicle.

It's not surprising to learn as to why this movie was given a lukewarm response from the critics as to a rather weak story and thin plot. However it was also nice to see that many took notice of Aaliyah's performance as this not doubt helped provide more publicity and success received. Though I'm a fan of vampires I was annoyed that it was only granted a 15 rating in the U.K. as I'm sure it would've been more gorier.It was also nice to see French actor Vincent Perez playing another dark Gothic role as Lestat's vampire maker since his role in The Crow City of Angels (no way better than the original). And the beautiful Swedish actress Lena Olin and newcomer Marguerite Moreau for their supportive performances. One of the most beautifully crafted scenes that really deserves a thumbs up is the concert confrontation involving Stuart Townsend and Vincent Perez and a large group of angry vampires battling it out on center stage in front of a large crowd of fans.

None of Anne Rice's characters were recognisable except that maybe they shared the same name. Lestat was obnoxious, cruel and totally unlikable in the movie, which seemed very surprising considering that millions of readers love him in the book. Marius was nothing like the wise, cultured and kind Vampire in the book(he wasn't even the one who made Lestat in the book) The makers of the film had such fun twisting the whole story upside down, I reckon. There are so many things I could say about how the movie does not do the books justice, but I would have to write an essay then. The story of the Legend of the twins was very essential to the story, but they left it out totally which leaves for so many questions.I read their official website where the producer explains why this was done, that they had no time to fit a lot of what the book is about into the movie, but I just don't buy it, Interview with the Vampire managed to do so, so why couldn't they. They should probably have cut down the long draggy shots in general, or not add additional cheesy scenes that did not exist in the book, THEN they could have got some content in. They just had to turn it into a stupid, cheesy, trashy Vampire flick, sigh. They shouldn't have called it the 'Queen of the Damned' if it wasn't really even safely based on the book, I bet Anne Rice had sleepless nights over this horrible movie.Okay, let's just put aside the books for a while and try to imagine that this movie wasn't based on one of the greatest Vampire characters and stories of all time.The effects were low budget, and the actors in general were bad not to mention the over excited and amateur actors in the backgrounds, obviously goths they pulled off the Melbourne streets.

Due to the occasion, paranormal researcher Jessica Reeves, (Marguerite Moreau) begins to see that his lyrics on based on occult history about vampires, indicating he really is a vampire. Going into his past, she learns of the connection he had with Marius de Romanus, (Vincent Perez) the vampire who created him, and with Queen Akasha, (Aaliyah) a vampire queen who rules over the breed. Realizing that his music has forced her resurrection and unleashed a torrent of death and destruction, she races to make him understand what's going on before she gets to him.The Good News This was a lot better than expected. In general practice, the last half of this one is it's best scenes, since it's got all the action scenes in the film. All of them are quite enjoyable as well, which makes for just as much fun. The concert scene here is the absolute best part here, taking up a rather significant portion of time to a fun concept, as there is specific songs that go through and once the vampires get involved up on-stage, it turns into a great action scene where, using the surroundings and wire-fu, manages to defeat the in front of the crowd who feels that they're merely putting on an act. Once the fire reigns down, it just cements the fun. The bar sequence, immediately after the resurrection is also really good since the fire gag makes it incredibly entertaining and just fun, as is the initial resurrection sequence. In the beautifully Gothic basement, complete with stone statues in a great setting, the musical keys for the resurrection are great and the clues that it's happened, in the form of a great series of really nice shock images in rapid-fire sequences, allowing for some wonderful moments and making it feel really creepy. The finale is excellent as well, as there's also the nicely erotic, but non-nudity bath sequence also make this fun. That it also does a nice job with the back-story of the lead vampire, especially in the montage throughout art history coming off the best, make it effective and nicely done. These here are the film's good points.The Bad News There wasn't a whole lot really wrong with this. One of the biggest issues is really just the fact that the vampire isn't very threatening. Remove the vampire aspect from any of these creatures and they become whiny Goth people who do nothing but mourn and whine all film long, either about the betrayal of vampire lore, lost loves or about finding out the past. It really makers them seem like complete weaklings rather than creatures which command fear. The fact that it's the major leads in this who do that are all the more reason to be apprehensive about it, as they're the ones spending the most amount of time and are just completely not that exciting or interesting. The brooding Goth doesn't make for good threatening vampires, and this one proves it. The other real flaw to this is the lack of blood and gore. This one has a rather healthy body count, gets a couple of really brutal deaths and some wonderful set-ups for gore, but nothing else about this really stands out because of the fact that it's just not bloody. The opportunity is there, but we get nothing more than neck bites for the majority of the kills, which isn't all that gory. A little more variety for these would've helped out tremendously. Overall, these are the film's problems.The Final Verdict Not nearly as terrible as imagined but with a couple of incredibly damaging flaws, this one barely manages to become watchable at worst. Give it a shot if you're a fan of the first one or the book series, in the mood for a mainstream vampire take or plain interested, otherwise heed caution on it.Rated R Graphic Violence and Language "},{"Title":"Why do people who read the books then dump on the flicks","Date":"1 July 2008","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" People, writing a novel and composing a film are not, repeat, NOT the same or even the same art form.I saw this 2002, flick last night as a discounted DVD.

Exactly. This film is not aimed to please Anne Rice fans we have books for that. This movie is sending the TVL/QOTD story to a wider audience. Onto the comment Queen of the Damned is about the Vampire Lestat (Stuart Townsend), who has just risen from a century-long sleep, drawn to the power of ... heavy metal music. He finds a band, and sets himself up as a 'new god', a rock star. I can see parallels to real life already. The Queen of the Damned, Akasha (Aaliyah, god bless her soul), is likewise drawn to heavy metal, and, as explained before in the film, Lestat has some history with her, drank her blood and got off on it, yadda yadda yadda. As a twist, Jesse(Marguerite Moreau), a young Talmasca, is drawn to Lestat for diversity. She reads his journal, is touched, falls in love with him, has some rather romanticized ideas about being vamped, and eventually gets turned by Lestat. Oh, and there is some b******t about the Ancients, but really, you don't pay to much attention to the storyline and end up just listening and watching Stuart Townsend. And little else.Biggest beef with the movie? Jesse. In the book, liked her. Played by Marguerite Moreau, she is boring as all get out, boring enough to speak in a near monotone. Also, Jesse and Lestat do not get all romantic. Sorry, folks. In my opinion, Stuart Townsend IS Lestat. He has the charm and sex appeal of the book Lestat, even without the correct physical features. Oh plus, he's a HOTTIE. Unlike Tom Cruise, who was plain creepy as Lestat in Interview with a Vampire. And Aaliyah. I wasn't an Aaliyah fan, and yet I find myself converted. While not really the Akasha in the book, and having a grand total of I think four scenes, she does her best with what she got. And considering she died, then some. The Ancients supporting cast, all good. Save Matthew Newton as Armand, and if you live in Australia, you know it's not his acting ability I'm talking about. He's creepy too. Lena Olin as Marharet is fantastic, although to old, and leaves me question who would play the phantom (filmwise) twin, Mekare. Marius, Vincent Perez. Oh, where to start. He was... confused. And factually incorrect. Not a great Marius. Fantastic soundtrack, alright special effects (the flying? Beg your pardon?), hot Stuart Townsend, above par costuming, boring Jesse, surprisingly good make up for a vampire movie, and no overcompensating nude scenes make for a good vamp film.So, unless you're a stickler-for-facts, whiny, anal Anne Rice fan, watch this film with an open mind, and you shall love it.

The years turn to centuries and something changes to the point where Lestat decides to get up (well, after five more minutes maybe). The sound that awakens him is not the industrial revolution, not the invention of the engine nor world wars but a rather bland collection of heavy metal music. Seeing how their fans worship the musicians, Lestat becomes one, however his fame brings the attention of a group of paranormal investigators &#150; in particular the curious Jesse. However Lestat's problems are not them but the other vampires who do not appreciate the publicity he has brought to their kind, not to mention the original Queen of the vampires, Akasha, who wishes to make Lestat her new king.This film struggles because it opens with a silly idea (that Lestat only returns because of formulaic heavy metal music) that it cannot get over for the majority of the time because it just doesn't scan at all. With this as its main narrative thrust (it never gets away from it) it is no surprise to find that the film fails to engage on more than a trashy movie level. It provides enough in the way of entertainment to be watchable but only if you're in an undemanding mood because it doesn't have anything that interesting in it and is consistently just quite bland. It doesn't help that the film feels cheap in many areas. The special effects consist of a blurring effect whenever anyone moves and this gets old very, very quickly. The use of rather basic metal music also makes it feel cheap &#150; I'm not sure why but it just doesn't work.Not meaning to be unkind but you can't help feel the film is smaller when you compare this cast with the cast that were originally in Interview. Townsend cannot help but send out low-rent vibes; he was enjoyable in League of Extraordinary Gentlemen but here he cannot carry the depth of the character (not that the script helps him out much) and he just does OK but nothing more. Aaliyah's death was a loss to the world of r'n'b but, on the basis of this film, she was no loss to the world of acting as she is terrible throughout. Behind a horrid accent, she seems to think that all she has to do is slink around the screen and, while that works in music videos, it is nowhere near enough for a film. In contrast Moreau is at least interesting even if her character makes no sense &#150; she is sexy when she has to be but is also vulnerable at the same time. Perez is dull, Olin is underused and McGann just floats around the edges of the film.Overall this is a pretty average film. If it is Saturday night and you are just looking for something brief and noisy to pass the time then this might do but there isn't really that much to it. A basic story based on an absurd idea is delivered with poor direction, low-rent actors and a lack of anything special in any aspect &#150; very few viewers will be satisfied with this.

Each one from Lestat to Pandora to Marius, had their own inner battles that served as an umbilical cord to their humanity. That along with the rich historic origins of vampirism exquisitely detailed from vampire to vampire, lent an aura of romanticism that few other writers could develop. The book, Queen of the Damned, connected the past with the present and introduced us to the group of immortals who hold the survival of fellow vampires in their hands. Queen of the Damned the movie, on the other hand, is just plain bad. From acting, writing, casting, directing, all facets of this exercise, which in essence is just a music video, utterly and miserably fail. After years of hibernation, Lestat awakes in the 20th century and decides to come clean and cause a ruckus as he usually does. This he does by writing an autobiography (the Vampire Lestat) and joining a rock band and thereby announcing to the world the secret of the cabal. This, as you can imagine is not taken lightly by the other bloodsuckers who revel in their nonexistence, living on the fringes of society. The vampire nation decides it's time that Lestat shuts up forever. At the same time, Akasha, literally the mother of all vampires, is also awakened and decides to enforce her vision of utopia on the suspecting world. Never have I seen such a bland, untalented, and unmotivated group of actors. Stuart Townsend plays a wooden and stiff Lestat who seems bored except when on stage. Aaliyah is truly miscast as Akasha. The scene where she enters a vampire bar is pure comedy. The few actors of substance like Lena Olin, are barely given any screen time. The dialogue is reminiscent of a cartoon. There are far too many vampire bar scenes where fashion attire is the only reason the scenes were shot. Black leather and heavy makeup, this is a good advert for the goth-look but nothing more. It&#129;fs image and style over content and substance. It's no wonder that Anne Rice disassociated herself from it. There seems to be a slew of directors from the MTV music video school of film making and though some learn enough to eventually make a decent film, the majority are better suited for commercials or even better yet, music videos. As long as it looks good, then it's fine. Eye candy works for a 5 minute music video but not for a 2.0hrs film. I didn't expect them to follow the storyline which is fine but it's clear that they chose this route only to appeal to the younger audiences in the same way they cast Townsend and Aaliyah. Demographically, I don't think the majority of Anne Rice's readers are teenagers. The only positive reviews I read, extol the beauty and looks of Townsend and Aailyah as reasons for liking the movie. Sorry but that's not enough for me and many others. I have made a note of those involved in this fiasco from the director to producers and will avoid anything they are involved in like the bubonic plague.

The first movie, Interview With The Vampire, wasn't bad. It wasn't a masterpiece, but it was slick, well-produced, highly dramatic - in parts even unsettling -, and featured what in my opinion is Tom Cruise's only truly charismatic role ever (as you can gather, I'm no fan of his). Kirsten Dunst's child vampire was very cool, possibly her best role ever (generally, I'm not a terribly big fan of her, either). All in all, an effectively entertaining movie. I rated it a 7 out of 10.Next I should mention that I'm not a fan, or reader, of Anne Rice, or of vampires generally. I just see the movies. But I hear things, and it was quite plain in the first movie that a number of rather significant liberties had been taken with the original story. The problem with that wasn't that it was done, but that it showed. While very well-produced, Interview With The Vampire was an obviously glossed-over version of the book, with many of the basic ideas and situations changed from the kind of clever ideas you see in a decently-written book and into the kind of rather less clever ideas you see in a typical mainstream Hollywood movie. The first movie, put simply, tried too hard to be mainstream. In my judgment, the second movie - Queen of the Damned - didn't make that mistake. Sure, there are changes in the story, but the thing is, it doesn't show. If you haven't read the books, Queen of the Damned works very well as an independent entity. And what's more, it preserves the feel of the books' ideas and situations extremely well. There's so much in this movie that is obviously taken directly from the books, because it's just that kind of clever scenes. This is not just fancypants Hollywood producers taking an original story and warping it into some soulless commercial sludge. This movie, despite the changes, shows respect to the original work, retaining much of its mood and atmosphere. How can I say this without having read the books? I dunno. It just feels that way, very strongly, when I watch it. I'm certain it's the case. The whole feel of the movie came across as thoroughly literary.I had heard, of course, that this movie was going to be bad, but the fact is that, quite surprisingly, I was thoroughly entertained by Queen of the Damned. Good story, cool acting, fun vampire action. It captivated me all the way through, and I even liked the ending. I'm not an Aaliyah fan, and while her acting in this movie technically wasn't very good, her character was still megacool, and she made a great supervillain. Maguerite Moreau also needs special mention. She is indeed stunningly attractive, and one thirsts for more material with her after having seen this.Ultimately, Queen of the Damned was a good movie. Not a great masterpiece, but an honest, coherent romp of an adventure, with some great ideas and generally good performances. As with the previous movie, I rate it a 7 out of 10, but it is a bigger 7 (which I have since raised to an 8). The first movie was melodramatic and too Hollywoodized; two shortcomings that the sequel did not have, which makes it more watchable. Furthermore, Queen of the Damned managed to use the entire goth subculture, and its stylistic similarities to the vampire concepts, so well that I became engrossed in a kind of culture - and music! - that I've never had any interest in before. That's quite an achievement!!I salute the producers of Queen of the Damned.Finally, I have to mention another cool vampire movie I watched recently The Twins Effect. It's a Hong Kong produced vampire comedy, superbly well-produced and uproariously enjoyable. Better than either of these Rice products. See it.

Anne Rice did the screen play for Interview with the Vampire and it was great, even though some parts were changed they wernt drastic changes and it didnt make a difference because the story was still the same as the book.  It seems as if they only got a summary of the movie and never actually read the book. They changed WAY TOO MUCH for it to be acceptable. They changed important things, like who made Lestat.

Instead it was nothing short than a mockery.The problems I have with the movie stem from the details. Lestat is blonde, in the movie he is brunette, yes a minor point, but how can anyone picture lestat without his angelic mane?, he does NOT have a love affair of any type with Jesse, and the Mekare, my self chosen namesake (Who IS THE QUEEN OF THE DAMNED) is not even in the MOVIE!?? Obsurd!I also have problems with the complete portrayal of Lestat. The actor playing him did not seem to understand that you cant just go on stage and say words that lestat would say and then BE lestat.. Lestat is not words, he is a state of mind. he is a force of nature.. He is the brat prince for god's sake! He deserved more respect. Even Tom Cruise, actor in such pop cultured flicks as Mission Impossible and Top Gun, was better at Lestat. In fact he even seemed to even understand the nuances of character latent within Lestat's preternatural mind. Lestat... is hard for any actor to portray, and even at the best of his abilities Townsend falls miserably short. The great romance will always be Louis and Lestat, was it even present in the film, no. In fact the movie makers did what I truly hate, they took a beautiful work that transcended boundaries, such as Horror, Romance, Gothic, and made it a work of Gothic Cliche.The beatiful story, a mythic tale, lyrical on the page!... trashed upon the silver screen.

I read the novel Queen of the Damned. And I have to say that this movie is a terrible adaptation of a great novel. Queen of the Damned is one of those films that seems to have been made to bore the hell out of you. A few scenes are extremely slow. Take for example the scene at the end, it is slow. So is the scene where Jesse gets into trouble with three vampires after she goes to a bar frequented by these creatures of the night to find Lestat. The action seems dull, fake. Unlike Interview with the vampire, everything in this film has a B-movie atmosphere. Even the logic of the film seems to have been scooped out from what seemed like a very, very tight budget. A vampire becomes a famous musician and asks all vampires to please come out of hiding. Why should they? Does Lestat want all vampires to get killed? Then the music of Lestat resurrects Akasha-or should we say that Korn and Static-X resurrected Akasha? Despite being the mother of all vampires, she seems a little pissed at her children; she walks into a bar populated by them and sets them all on fire. She is a vampire serial killer, but why is she doing this? Spoilers The vampires don't want Lestat to tell the world that vampires are real. So what's their idea of stopping him? During one of his concerts, while thousands of people are watching, they attack Lestat. Yeah, no one will see these vampires killing another vampire, just a couple of metalheads, no one will believe these people anyway.

As this movie is an adaptation and a sequel, this applies double. The answer I suppose, depends on how familiar you are with the original works.This project showed problems from the beginning.  Though it was a sequel to a critical and financial success , the budget was 30% lower and Anne Rice, who adapted her own novel the first time around, was denied the chance to do so again.In fact, forget what I said about this being a sequel.  None of the cast and crew from Interview with the Vampire return, the events of the previous movie are never mentioned, the style is quite different and only one character returns in any identifiable way.  What you're left with is two movies with a vampire named Lestat who seems to be full of himself.  If it weren't for the novels and Anne Rice's credit, people would probably regard this as a coincidence.Queen of the Damned inadvisably combines Anne Rice's novels Queen of the Damned and The Vampire Lestat into a single feature.  Fans of the books will be upset by the nearly eliminated back-story and the numerous changes, many of them significant and without apparent reason.  People who aren't familiar with the books will probably be a little more receptive, but even on its own merits, the movie isn't very good.Its main problem is that the script is full of ideas that aren't developed very well.  We're left with characters that are doing things, but why and why we should care are barely touched upon because the sections explaining that were removed or altered.  For instance, the ancients, who played a major part in the book, are in the movie, but we aren't told why they're here or who they are.  They're  just some vampires who show up for some reason.A slightly more serious problem is we aren't given any characters to like or identify with.  Unlike the book, the vampire characters kill indiscriminately, making them come across as much more villainous. Jesse, the only major mortal character comes across as dumb.  If we don't like anyone or understand what's going on, how are we supposed to care how it all turns out?The acting is serviceable, but not great.  Vincent Perez is quite good as Marius, and Aaliyah has a strong  screen presence, but her dubbed dialogue doesn't really work.  Everyone else is one notch above bad. Accents are a particularly notable problem.  Lead Stuart Townsend's attempt at a French accent is unfortunately one of the worst.The special effects are a mixed bag.  The vampire deaths are very impressive, but the speed and flying effects are laughable.  The sad part is that the DVD shows a documentary about the special effects and several of the other ideas they considered for this effect looked much better.The only real saving grace of the movie is the soundtrack.  Richard Gibbs and Jonathan Davis collaborated on an excellent score and also several original songs Lestat's  band performs.  While I know a few people disagree with me, I feel these are very fitting .  It's perfectly believable these songs could become hits and they seem just like what Lestat would come up with.I'm giving this movie a 3/10.  The music and a few good effects and production design decisions are all that keep it from being a one.  It isn't campy enough to be fun, isn't scary at all, so doesn't work as horror and has no apparent point or themes so it doesn't make for good drama either.

I liked the dark and brooding quality of the backdrops and the scenery. I thought that the locations and sets used for Lestat's various residences fit his character really well. The costumes were beautifully done and really modernized the story (remember the book was written about 15 years ago and fashion/media trends change quickly).I thought the acting was - for the most part - pretty good. The screenplay, on the other hand, was tragic.First off, I've seen arguments for and against movies following the plot of the books they've been adapted from. I'm one of the people who believes that the storyline in a movie should follow that of the book. Otherwise, why not just write a whole new story? That said, there are certainly times when cutting corners works and others when it doesnt.In my opinion, Queen of the Damned is one of those screenplays where the cutting of corners clearly doesn't work. It's an amalgam of one of the story archs connecting The VAmpire Lestat and Queen of the Damned, rather than just the story of QOTD in itself. That said, it appears the movie makers were assuming people had either read the books, or at least seen the first movie. However, the tone of this movie was so severely different from the first that it can't be said to be a true sequel.While Townsend played a passable Lestat in some ways, the other characters were atrocious. Aaliyah seemed to be directed to convey extreme age and power by walking slowly and talking in a vaguely eastern european accent. Transylvanian is what it sounded like to me... straight from the Lugosi school of vampiric arts. Cheesy, though I think Aaliyah still managed to carry off a decent portrayal of the ruthless egoist that was Akasha.The story was mangled beyond belief. Some of the central points of both books carried through, but the real beauty of Anne Rice's works are in the detail. Rice is a better story teller than she is a writer (in my opinion, of course), and so I read her books for the tapestry of settings, character traits and observations more than for her word choice or phrasing. Most of this was simply lost in QOTD.Talamasca? What's that? No explanation of how Jesse came to be involved that was clear to me (in the movie, of course). Why did Lestat rise? What happened to Luis? Remember, it wasn't just Lestat all the other vampires were after, it was Luis as well. Then again, this was QOTD, not TVL, in name at least.There was no way to fit the entire story of QOTD in one film without cutting in large pieces of The Vampire Lestat, so almost everything but the extremely central plot points were completely omitted. So, no depth, no exquisite tapestry.The whole Jesse/Lestat thing was just annoying. Jesse was a strong character in the books, and just a vampire groupie in the movie. Please, do it. I want you to. Ick.What they did to the character of Marius was a horror. Again, the only way I can account for any screenwriter seeing this digression from Rice's story as excusable was that they were simply trying to bridge the gap between Interview and Queen with as little effort as possible.Why pull in a bunch of characters from the novel and give absolutely NO explanation as to their presence? I read a post where someone said that the extras on the DVD explained who the people were. Feh. When I saw the movie originally, I saw it in the theater. I sat there wondering who they were and when Mekare was going to arrive. It must have been a minimal nod to Anne Rice fans who the writers assumed would be in the theater trying to pick out the details. Sadly, they forgot the actual details. A cameo by a woman in a sari hardly qualifies as intelligent character development.We won't even mention one of the main themes of the book the story of the twins. The movie certainly doesn't.All the complaining aside, if one tries to divorce the movie from Anne Rice's characters and stories, one is left with a passable view of vampires as seen by MTV. It's a 90 minute music video that is, in places, breathtakingly beautiful.If you want to see a movie with some really hot actors and actresses, you like a gothic edge to your music and favor the incredibly young and thin, you will probably like QOTD. If, on the other hand, you want to see the third book of The Vampire Chronicles brought to life, you'll have to wait for Anne Rice to write the screenplay herself, it seems.

Here is what is wrong with the movie in my view...Number One - The film contradicts the first movie, and the book where it states that Lestat isn't sleeping long before he is woken by the band, the book clearing states that Lestat slept for years, Interview With The Vampire tells us that Lestat took over where Louis left off with Daniel, the Interviewer, what happened after that, in respect to the second movie? It's anybodys guess! My best guess is that they never planned on a sequel.Number Two - In QOTD Lestat was made by Marius, lestats maker was Magnus, who killed himself in flames straight after making him.Number Three - What makes Lestat so damn conscious of his behaviours? The Lestat we know and love is cruel, the lestat we know, gives Louis a hard time, he is a cold blooded kills who steals even the innocence of children. On the beach in QOTD he is told by Marius he has a few lingering human emotions and that is why he feels bad for killing the girl, are they still lingering at the end of the movie, hundreds of years later when he takes pity on Jesse?Queen Of The Damned could have been such a good movie, if they had stuck to the lines of the book more, and made it a longer movie with more detail, not just 1 Hour and 40 Minutes of a spoilt child trying to get his own back on his brothers and sisters.

They are busy showing how he became a vampire and his success has a rock star. Aaliyah is a good actress, she actually had high hopes after her appearance in Romeo Must Die.

The difference between the two films is immeasurable. Neil Jordan's taut and spine-tingling story of 'the damned' suited Rice's prose; the characters of Louis, Lestat and Claudia were made not only fearful, but sympathetic. And, no, I am not about to bash Stuart Townsend when compared to Tom Cruise - he had the ability to make it work as Lestat. I'm blaming Queen of the Damned on someone not letting Anne Rice script the film (something which made Interview so great).So, obviously, Scott Abbott and Michael Petroni chose a different path. Good for them. But it doesn't make for a good film. After reading the book I was surprised at all the strange decisions they made such as the scene in which Akasha(Aaliyah) ate the still-beating heart... when you consider that Akasha, 6000 years earlier as Queen of Kemet(Egypt), killed cannibals mercilessly, even those who consumed the flesh of their relatives religiously, its rather an unusual choice to make.

The first one is Bram Stoker's Dracula, from Coppola, and the second one is The Vampire Chronicles, from Neil Jordan.  But I'd like you to pay a particular attention to the second title I mentioned...It is written by a woman named Anne Rice.Now, the point I'm trying to make is the following Knowing that Queen of The Damned is an adaptation of an Anne Rice novel, just like Vampire Chronicles was, there was some kind of...how could I say that...very high expectations around this film.  Well, let's simply say I was deceived in every way.Now, if I was such an evil and mean guy, I would compare both films based on Anne Rice's novels....but Queen of The Damned is so awful, if I compared it to a masterpiece like Vampire Chronicles, it would be like comparing Stanley Kubrick and Ed Wood...But, when I think about it, I'm not such a nice guy, and this film really deserves a bash!Where do I start, because every point of the film is a flaw?  But, I'll have to start with something, so let's go with the acting.  With a protagonist that is as spooky as a stupid eleven year-old kid with a vampire costume on Halloween night.  He really sucks.  Trying to look like a goth with his leather pants and transparent shirt...wow!  You only look like a fashion show robot!  That's the image of American goths...wannabes!  And thanks for keeping it alive, you idiot!  I just can't believe this guy and Tom Cruise are supposed to play the same role!  What a shame!  And there's Aaliyah...who plays the least sensual and scary vampire I've seen in a long time.  She also has a very limited talent in this film.  There is Vincent Perez, who has a very cheap role, and whose performance is consequently ruined.The directing has nothing impressive, it is very basic, it doesn't create any mood (now I'd like SOOOOO much to compare it to Neil Jordan's film!!!!!), and it is the most simple thing you can see, it still shows how lazy some Hollywood directors get for summer or blockbuster movies.  As much as Neil Jordan's film is moody, intense, beautiful, well shot, well acted, interesting, somptuous, and great, as much Queen of The Damned is a pure piece of scum!And, even though that may sound bizarre, there's the vampires.  You know, in movies, there are several kinds of vampires there are primitive, aggressive, black-blooded vampires (see John Carpenter's Vampires), there's classy vampires (Bram Stoker's Dracula and Vampire Chronicles), funny vampires (Fearless Vampire Killers, and the parody with Leslie Nielsen), classic vampires (Nosferatu, earlier versions of Dracula), and high-tech and criminal vampires (see Blade and Blade 2), disgusting vampires (From Dusk Till Dawn trilogy)...and, now, I'd like to add a new breed in the list, especially designed to describe the blood thirsty creatures in this movie cheap vampires!  They don't have the charm of classy vampires, they don't have the jokes of funny vampires, they don't have the make up of the disgusting vampires, they don't have the velocity and ferocity of aggressive and strong vampires....they simply got nothing!  NOTHING!Another element that some might find meaningless, but that I think is important in this kind of film, especially when everything else is bad...the gore!  NONE!!!  NONE NONE NONE!  No gore!  One brief decapitation, and that's it!  That's it!  Really deceiving.  Even the bestThe scenario is not that bad, but it is served on a plate that would completely ruin any good script.So, I know my review is pretty short, but there is not much to say about an empty film.  Again, this is today's version of vampire flicks...and it smells a lot like MTV crap.  Now, I simply imagine the director crying because he got a big R rating for his movie...I'm sure this was meant to be rated PG-13...but now Michael Rymer can go cry with his friends Paul Anderson (Another kick in the face of your Resident Evil!) and Renny Harlin (the arm being ripped out in Deep Blue Sea was too much...Renny!) who live in the desperate world of harder selling main stream scum, because of the very mean MPAA who refused to give them a PG-13 rating when they truly deserved one.  The only thing I can do is laugh at these guys...ha ha ha!Awful film...I give it 2/10.

But, in the quest to grow as a writer and film critic, I feel it is important to express my thoughts when I DON'T like a film.  Queen of the Damned is one of those films.Anne Rice's popular horror stories of Lestat, a bisexual Vampire, first took to the screen in 1994 in the successful An Interview With A Vampire. Starring two of Hollywood's biggest heavyweights in Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, the film's stylish aesthetic and gothic mise en scene captured the audience.  While it may have been a case of style way over substance, there was something about it that worked, despite its chessiness (I have never been that enamoured with the Vampire genre in general).Since that time Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise have gone on to much bigger things. It's likely both would have roared with laughter when asked to appear in a sequel.  They would have been laughing even harder when they saw the final outcome.  Queen of the Damned typifies the type of cr*p Hollywood is content to put out at a low cost with the hope of earning a quick buck thanks to an average soundtrack and big marketing campaign aimed at 13 to 17 year olds.Needless to say this film is terrible from the start.  Lestat, now played by Brit Stuart Townsend of Shooting Fish fame, awakens from his dark grave to the sound of... you guessed it, Nu-Metal.  He freaks out some confused punkish musicians and joins their band, under the proviso that he only appear at night, what with the sun burning his skin and all during the day...Jesse (Marguerite Moreau), a student studying the paranormal (Vampire Studies 101 perhaps?), tries to find out if Lestat really is who he says he is.  Along the way she falls for him (something to do with her odd past), but has a little competition in Queen Akasha (Aaliyah), a Vampire demon queen who is returning from the underworld to acquire Lestat as her chosen King.The film is shamefully self-indulgant, yet its campy tone leaves some room for its depreciating humour.  Anybody who sees this film for anything but a good laugh needs to see more films in general!  Watching Townsend is enjoyable.  He knows the role is utterly over the top and does his best to walk the tightrope between utter hamming and serious acting.  The late Aaliyah is, unfortunately, terrible in the title role.  She has minimal screentime, and what she does have she does not use to the fullest.  The poor makeup and special effects do not help; at times she sounds like she's talking through a voicebox.It is rumoured that this film was heading straight to video until Aaliyah's untimely death last year.  With the possibility for people to see her final film, Warner Bros put this out to a general release.  Otherwise this would have been one of those movies you see on the shelf at video shops but avoid because you can tell it is going to be simply terrible.No doubt films like this will continue to be made.  Look at the spate of teen rom-com rip offs around or the spoofing of that genre itself with films like Not Another Teen Movie.  If there is a market to exploit Hollywood will do so.The biggest issue I have with this film is not the film itself.  Hollywood is about making money, so if there is a market for this film then they will pursue it.  That's business.  But what concerns me the most is that people will actively go out to the cinema and pay money to watch it!  I guess that's the biggest argument in the world of cinema is film art first and entertainment second, or is it the other way around?  The only people who can decide that is the audience.  If you like and are intrigued by good films, stay clear of this turkey.

As it turned out, Cruise turned in a blinder of a role and Ms Rice conceded as much, saying she had been a tad hasty in her earlier condemnation of Tommy boy. The film was a gothic revelation, big on style and STILL the best thing Kirsten Dunst has yet come up with.This travesty however bears as much similarity to Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles as Batman! For attention-deficient surface viewing only - PLEASE, no thinkers! An absurd compilation of plot contrivances from the two books The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned, all that's left is a kick-ass rock soundtrack!  To have pre-read Anne Rice's works is a two-edged sword. Sure it will give you the sound back-up knowledge you need, to see where this tale fits-in in the grand scheme of things (It might even help fabricate an explanation of the absurdly edited and disjointed events up there on the screen). It will also show you how appalling a transition this is from the printed word to the K-Mart script!Its not Aaliyah's fault. Her untimely death may well even generate an interest in the flick that otherwise would not be there. She has little to do anyway but a vague GOLDFINGER impersonation and to glare people to death, notably on a beach when she dispatches several hundred in one hit. Other than that she merely gives her metal bra a workout and shimmies now and then for the benefit of every young male in the audience.The film has no soul (perhaps in acknowledgement of the vampires themselves), no real cohesion and absolutely no intelligence.

I quite liked him in Shooting Fish, playing a cheeky chappie.  The next film I saw him in was League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.  And not content with mincing his way through that, he does the same in Queen of the Damned.  Admittedly, the poor guy is having a hard time of it at the moment, given that he will forever be 'the man that was sent home from LOTR - the greatest film of our time'.  Although that may be some of karmic force repaying him for his performance in Queen of the Damned.In his defence, Townsend is fighting a losing battle.  The script appears to have been written by someone who read the book 10 years ago and is trying to write a script based on what they can remember.  'There was  really cool character called Mael, who was a Druid, but I can't remember who he was or what he did . . . never mind, I'll put him in anyway.'  Townsend also has the disadvantage of having to follow Cruise's sterling performance in Interview with the Vampire.  He's obviously trying to go down a completely different route and make the character his own - unfortunately, he doesn't quite get there.  He looks the part of a vampire goth rock star, but that's as far as it goes.  Aaliyah was a magnificent Aakasha - however the script seemed to demand little more from her than the ability to wear a very sexy costume and hiss a lot - although her tragic death may have meant that lots of wonderfully written exposition could not be filmed.  Yeah, right.As a sexy vampire horror movie, Queen of the Damned is okay.  As an adaptation of hugely passionate novel it fails in so many ways.  The characters have been butchered, the stories and histories irreparably damaged.  It's only saving grace is it's soundtrack.

She shows potential and, along with Stuart Townsend, is the best thing about this movie.  However, neither of the two principal actors are given enough to work with, and the movie comes off as messy and confusing.The movie begins with a narration by Lestat, who awakes after many years asleep in a cemetery, and begins his life as a punk rocker.  He becomes an international sensation, much to the chagrin of the Ancients, a kind of pantheon of very old vampires.  It seems that by revealing himself, Lestat has broken the ancient vampire code of secrecy.  Lestat, however, is ambitious, as well as lonely.  His biggest regret as a vampire is that he cannot know mortals (particularly women) without killing them.  However, he definitely has a dark side, and does sometimes enjoy killing.We are introduced to Marius, the Ancient who made Lestat a vampire.  For reasons that somewhat elude me, Marius keeps Akasha and her consort preserved in his basement.  Akasha is only asleep and is awaken when she hears Lestat playing the violin.  Akasha is apparently the mother of all vampires, and incredibly evil (even by vampire standards).  A former Egyptian queen, she slithers seductively around Los Angeles (or was it London?-locations change with little notice) destroying vampires at her whim.  Into this mix of interesting characters comes Jesse, whose identity is not really explained.  Apparently she is the only mortal in a family of vampires.  She works for an organization which apparently hunts vampires, but quickly decides she wants to become one when she meets Lestat.  And who can blame her---Stuart Townsend plays Lestat with seductive perfection.  Unfortunately, his talents are not put to good use, and he becomes little more than eye candy.  We spend much too much time with the love-struck Jesse, and not enough time developing Lestat and Akasha's story.  I for one would liked to have seen Lestat and Akasha's background stories as well as have seen their relationship better developed.  In the end, the Ancients and Lestat turn of Akasha and destroy her.  According to them, they do it to preserve their mortal heritage (one of the Ancients is related to Jesse), although Marius seems to take as much pleasure in killing mortals as Akasha, so I am not sure what the Ancients really intend on preserving.On a positive note, the costumes and music are great.  I am not a big Gothic or punk rock fan, but I liked the tone that the movie took. Furthermore, although the world of vampires is filled with blood and violence, the movie does not go overboard in this regard.Fans of Interview with the Vampire will probably want to see this movie to learn a little bit about where Lestat came from and who made him.

What is ultimately the most notable is deciding whether the special effects or the dialogue is cheesier in this B-grade vampire movie.  Allegedly based on Anne Rice's The Vampire's Chronicles, the movie certainly raises the question on whether director Michael Rymer has ever read the source material. There is some kind of plot here, but the reckless visual style never is able to distinguish anything of storytelling clarity, especially in the final third of the movie. Stuart Townsend plays the multi-centuries old vampire Lestat (there's a reason why Tom Cruise didn't come back), whom in the present day has become a punk rocker in effort to capture a legion of fans. This movie however is showcasing it as the feature film debut of the 22-year old singer Aaliyah, who died tragically earlier this year.  By the way, it's not her feature debut, it's not even her first `starring' role either; Romeo Must Die has those honors. Some of her fans will be disappointed that she doesn't arrive with her first speaking scene until the first hour into the movie.There is an adrenaline of excitement when Aaliyah does make her arrival which sends the screen blazing. As the 6,000-year old vampire Akaska, the late singer has an electrifying introduction, but it is too bad however that the movie's thrills are few and far between. Townsend has a few amusing scenes where he invites a couple of groupies into his private sanctuary. The groupies are hot for this punk rocker, but Lestat is hot for their blood which is fortunate because some of the nastiness does generate some chuckles. Blood is a welcome palette of color in this movie because it is photographed in dreary, dark gray-blue tones. The scenery is often very bland, and so after awhile it becomes easy to welcome bad dialogue in order to spark some kind of amusement. Cheesy sample dialogue `There's nothing left but the cold, dark wasteland of eternity,' Lestat bemuses, bored with his immortality. He thankfully has a publicist and fanfare that will encourage him with compliments like, `You're bold like your music!' A vampire scholar played by Marguerite Moreau (in need of some of Mariah Carey's acting tips) tracks down Lestat in order to learn from him, and then becomes seduced by his black charms. Unsurprisingly, there is little interest between them.The real heat in the film exists between Lestat and Akaska, whom together momentarily resuscitate a movie in danger of flat-lining. The scenes between them, especially the ones that involve them drinking from each other's blood, are morbid but teasingly erotic. Also in this movie exists scenes of underground night clubs that patronize the vampire culture, and surprise, they are all into grunge rock. What is worse however is that much of the movie's sensationalistic scenes are filmed and edited like a bad grunge rock music video. Also, once you get past the thin and unrealized potential of the plot, there isn't much left here that will make you give a damn.

That was the notion I enternained until I saw Queen of the Damned.The idea of painting a picture of a modern day vampire is to me inspired genius and may recreate the way the world looks at this genre in the future. The backdrop of the gothic/heavy metal music industry brings an extra facet into this movie and in a way modernises the whole way I look at these blood guzzling brutes.A convincing performance by many of the cast members adds to the alure of the film and hopefully (although not being a huge fan of gothic music myself), will lead to this style of music coming to the fore in future soundtracks of this sort. I would encourage all moviegoers to give this one a watch, if not for the storyline then certainly for the moving and inspiring musical content, and the thought provoking backtones to this film.

But what grandeur!!","Date":"10 June 2005","Score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" QUEEN OF THE DAMNED Aspect ratio 2.391 (Panavision)Sound formats Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDSAt the end of the 20th century, the vampire Lestat (Stuart Townsend) rises from his undead slumber and adopts the guise of a rock star, which draws the attention of a beautiful vampiress (Aaliyah) who wants to conquer the world...Forsaking the introspective melancholy of its highbrow predecessor (INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE THE VAMPIRE CHRONICLES), this ill-conceived sequel plays like a Gothic MTV fantasy with delusions of grandeur. But what grandeur! Combining elements from two of Anne Rice's celebrated 'Vampire Chronicles' ('The Vampire Lestat' and 'Queen of the Damned'), the narrative is anchored by Townsend's ultra-sexy turn as anti-hero Lestat. Flamboyant without ever seeming camp, he strikes a more dynamic figure than Tom Cruise's foppish blade in the previous film, and it's all too appropriate that he should locate himself within the modern music industry, with its outlandish characters and overzealous visual style (several of Lestat's music videos - inspired by German expressionist cinema of the 1920's - are convincing down to the last detail). However, while most of the songs - co-written by Richard Gibbs and KoRn vocalist Jonathan Davis - encapsulate the spirit of Lestat's heartbroken worldview, their aggressive fatalism will alienate some viewers and date the movie pretty quickly.As in the original, director Michael Rymer (IN TOO DEEP) downplays the homoerotic undercurrent which forms a significant aspect of Rice's literary style. Nevertheless, the script - written by Scott Abbott (INTRODUCING DOROTHY DANDRIDGE) and Michael Petroni (THE DANGEROUS LIVES OF ALTAR BOYS) - actively celebrates the 'outsider' lifestyle (vampires, Goths, rock fans, members of secret societies, etc.) and tips a knowing wink to the initiated when Lestat exhorts his fellow vampires to Come out, come out, wherever you are! Aaliyah makes the most of her extended cameo as the Queen of the Damned - she even manages to steal some of Townsend's erotic thunder! - and her final sequence includes one of the most visually stunning vampire disintegrations ever captured on film. Sadly, the singer-actress died in a plane crash shortly after completion of principal photography. Also starring Vincent Perez (THE CROW CITY OF ANGELS) and Lena Olin (ROMEO IS BLEEDING) in secondary roles.

She is very credible as Akasha. I loved her movements and speech, her facial expressions, her body language&#133;they all brought across the character very well. It makes her death all the more sad, knowing that Hollywood could've had a terrific actress on their hands had she not been in that tragic plane accident.--This film won't disappoint horror gurus. I totally dug the beheading, the heart ripped out (juicy goodness!) and truckloads of blood all over the show.--The exchange between Jesse and Lestat during the scene at the park where she asked to be turned into a vampire was very well written and somewhat moving. It regained some of the material worked on in Interview with the Vampire The Vampire Chronicles with the pros and cons of being a vampire expanded on.--Queen of the Damned was not made to be the next Psycho - it was made for younger audiences to enjoy a good, chilling time out at the movies. In general, this flick entertained me. I was interested in the story and found it very entertaining and fun. The movie has flaws, but if you're a fairly laid-back viewer looking for some fun, you just might like Queen of the Damned.THE BAD--Interview with the Vampire The Vampire Chronicles taught us about Lestat, so shouldn't Queen of the Damned teach us about Akasha? We learnt all about Lestat in the predecessor to this film, and all we learn about Akasha during this instalment is that she's one fine vampire who's pretty damn gruesome. You don't always have to have the actor acting to learn about the character - interesting conversations, perhaps even flashbacks could've told us more about this gorgeous vampire queen. Her character suffered because of it.--The romance story between Lestat and Akasha is steamy but nothing more. It is lazily thrown into the film with little chemistry or development.--The ending sucks! It just looked ridiculous with all the vampires flying around eating Akasha. Ugh. Perhaps this wasn't what the screenwriter and director had planned but Aaliyah's untimely death may've had to cause changes in the script.--The rock concert sequence was pretty neat, but it was annoying that the humans had no reaction whatsoever to seeing vampires flying around fighting on-stage. Wouldn't you like&#133;run and try to get the hell out of there?RATING7/10 - Though with numerous flaws, I still found this movie to be solid entertainment. Think of it as a rock music video&#133;extremely loud, slick looking, flashy, cheesy, silly, yet just so much fun you can't help but sing along.IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE I RECOMMENDBlade (7/10) Blade 2 (8/10) Interview with the Vampire The Vampire Chronicles (9/10) Resident Evil (8/10) Urban Legends Final Cut (2/10) "},{"Title":"If you loved the book...

I mean, you've got a hottie like Stuart Townsend (Lestat), you've got ancient vampires, and you've got the wonderfully evil and fairly attractive Akasha (Aaliyah).Nice deal, right?No, not if you know the book as well as I do now.If you want to be really picky, you could point out how Lestat is supposed to have blonde hair and blue eyes, or that Marius was not his maker. Yeah, those are some bad things. But what really got me was some of the actors in general. When looking closer from Tom Cruise Lestat in Interview to Townsend, you've got to admit, though Townsend is nice eye candy, Cruise pulls off the role so much better. As a past reviewer said, when it comes to love scenes, or scenes with Moreau Jesse in general. All ancient vampires, with the exception of Aaliyah Akasha herself, and possibly Claudia Black Pandora, are terrible actors. Vincent Perez plays Marius, supposebly Lestat's maker, though in the book this was the Vampire Magnus. Perez wouldn't be so bad if he wouldn't try and act SO MUCH like a vampire that his very voice is annoying. The very character of Marius, who in the books I absolutely loved, is terrible. It's so... out of character for him to do and act the way he does in this film. I suppose Lena Olin Maharet isn't too bad, but her character was also put way out of proportion, excluding a big part of her story-line. The other ancients, Armand, Mael, and Khayman? Terrible. No skills whatsoever. Matthew Newton's portrayal of Armand makes me want to beg and scream for Antonio Banderas to reprise his role from Interview.*sigh* So many things wrong with this film. To think, Rice actually approved. Was she drugged? Drunk? Bribed? Possibly. The soundtrack is good, Moreau isn't actually so bad, though Jesse's character was also twisted and turned far too much. The Lestat falling in love with Jesse storyline wasn't too bad, but it's completely wrong if you've read the books. And where were dear Louis and Gabrielle? One does wonder. It also p***es me off that Pandora was killed, which never happened in the book. And don't get me started on how Akasha was messed with...Perhaps I am too critical. It's been said. The SpecialFX really were amazing, Aaliyah was brilliant, but... it ended to quickly. It ended WRONG. The book is a god, this is a devil.In conclusion, unless you've never read the books, I suggest you keep away from this movie. Even if not, be wary.

Therefore, I saw the film version of Queen of the Damned free of expectations and book-purist prejudices...and I wasn't impressed.I love Vampire movies.  I'm always looking for really GOOD vampire movies, and, believe it or not, they are very hard to find.  I can't stand pretty-boy vampires who spend two hours of screen time whining about their endless, lonely lives and the agony of being Damned by God, all the while fluffing their hair and adjusting their lace collars.  But although Lestat is by no means whiny, he also isn't very likable.  He is arrogant and smarmy, badly in need of a good hard slap.  Even in scenes where he's supposed to be portraying compassion, he looks like he's admiring his own reflection and trying not to smear his lip gloss too much.  It's a mystery to me why any woman, mortal or otherwise, would fall in love with such a JERK.  But yet, young Jessie does.  Jessie, who seemingly spends more time on her hip, cool wardrobe than on her education, falls in love with Lestat after reading his diary and proceeds to stalk him through several time zones.  Oh yeah, and the Queen of the Damned (the late Aaliyah) arises from her slumber, goes clubbing and kills the bartender, or something.  From there on out, it's a battle between the Queen and the Mortal for the attention of the pasty, leather clad Lestat.  There are other vampires here too, reduced to mere wallpaper in favor of artsy rose-petal bathtub seductions, steamy dance clubs and a gothed out concert where Type O Negative would have been a more appropriate headlining act.  This is a shame, because the other vampires seemed a lot more interesting and I would have liked to have heard their stories instead of Lestat's.  Vincent Perez in particular was wasted, which is a shame because he was the only good actor in the film, making Marius a funny, likable Vampire. I can't say this movie was totally terrible.  Parts of it were good, and the music was well done, but it had no heart, no soul and just seemed like an overlong rock video.  It could have been so much better, but it's ultimately flat and lifeless.  Worth watching once, just to say you did.

In fact, I liked it better than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise's attempt. All the major players from the series were present Talbot, Lestat, Armand, Maharet, Khayman, Pandora, Mael, Marius and a half-dozen more (albeit most of them in cameo). Marius, Lestat and Akasha were the main players (and Jesse of the Talamasca). Also, despite other reviews, I think this movie and the music was faithful to Anne Rice's portrayal and ethos, at least as I perceive it. Aailiyah was pretty good as Akasha, in places compelling (her first entrance and mini dance scene). The movie didn't capture the breadth of the books series but I thought it was a nice supplement.I'm a big fan of this series mostly due to Anne Rice's style, sensitivities and treatments. And I found this movie a faithful and often superlative representation of the author's vision.

My wariness soon faded after the first five minutes into this film. I found myself lured in completely with the much more appealing goth atmosphere, and I settled in for the anticipation that this one would be different. I've always felt when you play the role of a mythical character, especially a vampire, you should look and act the part. Stuart Townsend took my breath away and never gave it back until the end. It was like finally seeing the real Lestat brought to life in front of me. I found myself experiencing the pain and adventure right along with him. It wasn't until Akasha made her entrance as the queen of vampires that I was able to break away from Townsend's performance. I was surprised by the depth of Aaliyah's talent. It was more artistic and developed from her role in 'Romeo Must Die.' She left this world with a crowning achievement in cinema, leaving us to ask the question 'What might have been?' This is a movie I still enjoy watching from time to time, and would recommend that anyone who's a fan of Anne Rice, or Lestat, will want this one in their collection.

Along his journey he meets Jesse Reeves (Marguerite Moreau) who after getting a hold of his journal from David Talbot (Paul McGann) begins to become curious about Lestat begins to look for him only for him to find her. However he is unaware that he is about to awake the mother of all vampires Akasha (Aaliyah) with his music and wants to bring hell to Earth.Also the film takes us to where Lestat becomes a vampire thanks to Marius (Vincent Perez) as he begins to teach Lestat about the life of a vampire. Queen Of The Damned actually took plots from The Vampire Lestat And Queen Of The Damned. And This was Aaliyah's last film before her death and it's sad that we didn't see her much in the film but the scenes she took part in she really shine as the antagonist. Akasha was pure evil with no compassion for life. She ranks up there as one of the most evil villains I have seen and in my opinion of the best things about this film.Lestat being played by Townsend I actually enjoy his performance better as the anti-hero, plus Marguerite's performance as Jesse made it interesting for her.The movie best feature is the soundtrack which I remember buying in 2002 before I saw the film, the soundtrack is one of my most favorite movie soundtracks with my favorite song begin Forsaken sung by David Draiman of Disturbed which I felt set the tone and story of the movie. Jonathan Davis wrote a superb score for the film and the songs he did for the film really help tell the story of Queen of the Damned.

Trying to have Marius as Lestats maker...*sigh* And changing a few of the physical appearances of the characters. Leaving out important sequences of the story. The book, Queen of the Damned had an excellent story to it, which like most movies based on books, destroy.So from that aspect, don't hope for anything too similar to the story you love.The movie, apart from the book, was pretty cool. The music was excellent as well as some great camera angles. The actors chosen did a fairly decent job. In all honesty, it's one of my favorite movies. And the only reason I rated a 7, is because I REALLY wish it had been like a 2-3 part series covering the book better. I think it could have done well. Like I said before the actors did well portraying the characters, and would have continued doing well, in a 2-3 part series.Sex A really nice Bathtub scene. Drugs None. Unless you count cigarettes. Profanity Mild use of some 4 letter words. Violence YES.Overall, I'd recommend this to vampire fans, these ones don't sparkle. I'd also recommend this to Anne Rice fans who can set aside the differences from the book, because this is a good movie on it's own.

It's part of the fun of a Moroccan restaurant ogling the belly dancers. But it doesn't make much of a plot.My first major problem is the music. I have the feeling that when Ann Rice wrote The Vampire Lestat, the Cure was more the style of the music he would have liked (though I could be wrong). I know relating to current goth music might have seemed like a good idea, but they did a horrific job incorporating it. Lestat was an actor with presumably a pretty good singing voice. That they chose Jonathan Davis to be his stage voice is heartbreaking.Second, and someone else said it, mashing two very intricate books into one crappy movie is a bad idea. Lestat could have been a movie in it's own right, and a damn good one if done right. I honestly don't think Queen of the Damned lends itself to a movie very well. Though I would love to see a movie that incorporates a creation story, there's too much, how to word this, inaction in the book for it to be a very interesting movie. And the retelling they did soiled it pretty badly. Now mind you, it's been a long time since I've read it, I always thought Lestat, Tale of the Body Thief and Memnoch the Devil were much more action packed and would have made better movies.I know a lot of people (hey, myself included) who like a lot of cheesy vampire crap that thought this was absolutely the worst of the genre to be a major motion picture.

The performance lacked the sense of unique angry insanity brought to it by Tom Cruise in Neil Jordan's 'Interview with the Vampire' now ordinarily i wouldn't dream of saying such a thing about Tom Cruise but we all have to make exceptions and he played Lestat to perfection.The ending was Hollywood not Anne Rice, it all seemed it end rather suddenly in a dark Indiana Jones sort of way. In a dramatic final scene with serious over-kill as far as visual effects are concerned Lestat saves the day.I swear Lestat has had a personality change! In 'Interview-' he was so... flawed with no care for human life and yet here he practically becomes Louis and it doesn't suit him.That character Jesse, she annoyed me and i don't know why she just did.Overall It's worth watching but nothing about it exceeds Interview with the Vampire so don't expect anything nearly as good.

Also you need to be prepared as the movie is a bit confusing as there are no less then three threads woven in the story. I have read that the movie is based on two of the novels of Anne Rice, which the writers then try to work into one movie. This might explain the obvious complexity.The main thread of the movie tells us of the vampire Lestat who gets involved in awakening Akasha, a god-like vampire, who's first and only thought after rising is to destroy anything in her path. Since us mortals can have a sour mood after one night, this might reflect the hangover an immortal can have after sleeping several thousands of years(and been fed upon by Lestat somewhere along the line). Not an unreasonable sentiment I suppose. This first thread is getting more confused because for some reason Akasha has decided that Lestat will be her consort and therefore is excluded from the list of beings to exterminate. We are not told why. Maybe this is what sucking on super-vampires will do for you. The second thread of the movie is taken up by the story of the world-weary vampire Lestat in which we are told that his unlife is dull. In fact he is bored from the moment he is turned into a vampire and in the end he is so bored that he exposes himself to the public by becoming a Gothic rock-star(hint Marilyn Manson) thus invoking the wrath of the other vampires, who don't like to be exposed to the general public. Anything for a little bit of excitement I suppose. The third thread is the story of a girl named Jesse who's only mission in life seems to be to offer herself as a sacrifice to Lestat. Lestat refuses to do his duty as a vampire and serves anyone else but this girl up to the very end. Maybe not unreasonable in hindsight, as this girl chases away his boredom this way. However this idea is never brought forward in the movie. But with all this complexity you need to have a good crew to make the movie work and here is where it starts to falter. This movie has an obvious tight budget with it low budget gci graphics and inexpensive movie tricks and works with a unremarkable crew starting from the director down to the screenplay writers and cast. The director might not be bad, but in this movie he is certainly not great. The writers(Anne Rice seems to have declined the honor of participating) have difficulty to work the novels into a proper story line. Not strange since they have no track record to speak off. Unfortunately the movie for a large part is made up out of dialog and while this might sound easy to achieve, it is in fact very difficult to keep an audience captivated with dialog for more then five minutes. And in this movie more then half of the running time is made up out of dialog only. The main cast isn't inspiring. Stuart Townsend I found uninteresting. Aaliyah certainly is interesting and she was around that time a popular singer, but as an actress she had almost no experience and in this movie she moves and speaks in an awkward way as if she is partly a snake. Maybe this was on purpose, but the reason is not explained and to me it just looks likes bad acting. Perez and Moreau are decent actors, but their characters are so locked down that they can't save the movie whatever they do. What I found a bad point for the movie is the fact that it to obvious tries to attract various audiences. Aaliyah is added to attract her admirers, Townsend is a Gothic rock artist to attract the Gothic crowd(and gives away a almost ten minute performance halfway the movie for this end only) and the story itself is set to entice Anne Rice fans. None of these people will watch the movie with satisfaction I think.My entire point is that the movie could have been better if the team had concentrated on one main thread, added more action and had made more of Aaliyah's other talent performing. Personally I would have replaced Townsend by Perez. The entire 'Jesse' story was pointless and could have been left out. The look back on Lestats past seems also rather pointless so it could have been left out as well, or maybe only brought up as flashback. The Gothic look of some parts of the movie is so overused that leaving it out would alone have improved it instantly.All in all the story was to much for the crew and in the end they where overwhelmed by it. So when you go and watch it, don't expect too much as it is a mediocre movie at best.

I gave up on Anne Rice's take on vampires after Interview With The Vampire--both the book and the film. Even Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt can't make a gaggle of hysterical shrieking queens in capes remotely interesting. It's rather like Ru Paul and Harvey Fierstein in goth drag. (In the interest of full disclosure, I'm gay.) And then we come to Queens (oops, Queen) Of The Dead. The acting, generally, is at least consistent with a gaggle of hysterical shrieking queens--Stuart Townsend, in particular, is reminiscent of Hayden Christiansen Darth-Vader-pouting-teen, but with really bad eye makeup.And then we have the alleged sole queen, Akasha, interpreted by Aaliyah--a new candidate for worst eye-scorching-shockingly-horrible-the-universe-is-about-to-collapse performance by an (alledged) actress. Yes, friends, she slinks, she pouts, she snarls, she looks about as Egyptian as Debbie Boone. Not even the COSTUME looks Egyptian.And what's the single worst thing about this film--without further examination of more bad acting, without examination of flatfooted direction, without even noting the utter absurdity of the plot, even by Anne Rice's dubious standards? It's not even good campy fun. It's not even so-bad-it's-good--it's too bad for that. It makes the average Ed Wood film look like Citizen Kane.

Now comes The Queen of the Damned. The upside to this movie is that it was a good vampire film. The downside is that it had very little to do with the book and completely mutilated the actual book's plot. I was very disappointed in this. Why did the director completely avoid the story of the red-haired twins? Marius did not make Lestat! Lestat and Jessie do not end up together in the book. Maharet does not turn into a pillar of salt at the end of the book (well, that's what she looked like in the movie). Lestat does not get the violin from a gypsy on a beach. This movie had the potential of being an Artistic vision of the book, but it ended up being a campy, rock and roll MTV vampire story that didn't capture anything close to the spirit of the book. I think the fans deserved something more. Overall, this is a decently made good vampire movie &#150; but it could have been done as ANY vampire movie.

Marius and Pandora are grotesque parodies of the stunning characters in the books. Armand is a joke. Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah were the only saving grace - however, Aaliyah (gorgeous though she is) commands none of presence and authority of the vampire queen. The special effects make me want to watch Ghoulies 3 all over again. Second, although this would have been a challenging screenplay for anyone to write, the writer does a useless job of establishing the characters and their motives.

But it seemed like almost every single change he made would've made the movie better.Example; in the movie, LeStat has short brown hair, which is both inaccurate to the book and contradicts the first movie. Especially since vampires can't cut their hair this was not only established in the last movie but was actually a plot point during Kirsten Dunst's tantrum.There was another vampire who sired LeStat but he has REALLY short hair, again, vampires can't cut their hair. And in the book, apparently, he had LONG GREY hair.The Queen of the Damned herself had been petrified, and is first seen as a statue, but was reanimated by blood. In the book, her clothes, jewelery and hair were still real. This would've made allot more sense. In the movie whatever petrified her turned her gold jewelery and her cloth garments to stone, too, and these things are also turned back into gold and cloth by blood.The only change I'm not complaining about is her skin. The Queen of the Damned, like Cleopatra, was not actually of Ejyptian blood, but was white. She looks fine as she is.

They're not convincing enough, not half as impressive as they're supposed to be in the first place.I somehow think that it's not their fault, I mean, I believe no actor, good or bad, could ever nail the part of Lestat.He's too magnificent, too irresistible to be played by just anyone. So that makes the movie not credible at all.Perhaps they should have choose a rock star to play that role. Personally, I think that Ville Valo would have absolutely nailed it if he just dyed his hair blonde (although I'm not sure if he can actually act, but he would have fitted the part more than Tom Cruise or Stuart Townsend, or just any actor at all).And then, of course, following the real story on the books, working on the dialogs, letting the author get involved in the screenplay and focusing on the facts that go along on the movie more than just use them as an excuse to make some sort of erotic goth love story would have helped a lot.I give it 5 out of 10 just because, watching the movie without considering the fact that it's based on the books, it is somehow entertaining.

Lestat has arisen after a hundred years of 'sleep' to become a rock star. His music reveals names and secrets of Vampires the world over, enraging the entire vampire community. Akasha, the mother of all vampires, has been awoken from her sleep by Lestat's music. She decides to make him her consort and resume her rule as Queen of the Damned.Firstly, Michael Rymer needs to be chased naked through nettles by a pack of rabid dogs. Secondly, When Anne Rice offers to do your screenplay for free, ACCEPT! Then you might end up with something that amounts to more than a prolonged music video for a very bland and childish character. And that's what Stuart Townsend's Lestat is. Yes, he's gorgeous, and OK, his Creole accent's passable, but how do you follow on from one of the most amazing portrayals of Anne Rice's most beloved vampire? Quite simply you don't. (Tom Cruise spoils it for everyone again.) Bit of a shame, because Townsend does have his moments. He is very slick and sexy in the music video segments of the movie, but with dialogue as inane as this screenplay's it's hard to make a character believable when he spouts idiotic lines like Boo Back&#133; not much of the sensuality, egotism or charm of the original character remains in this version &#150; this time around, Lestat is a whiny, tantrum-throwing angry young man. And there's a big difference between hammy acting and lack of talent. So it's a bit of a shame the whole movie centres around him, really.Aaliyah's portrayal of Akasha is good, although she unfortunately does little more than squint in a sinister way, belly dance about in a small metal bra and set other vampires on fire. Aaliyah's acting &#150; dodgy Egyptian accent aside &#150; is probably the best in the movie, but again, she's that underused that her character loses her menace. After a while she's just this pissy bitch who wants her own way all the time. Which is a true shame as her motives in the book do actually have a point. And to say this movie's title is Queen Of TheDamned, said Queen is curiously shoved into the sidelines, and the movie becomes more about Lestat's rise to rock superstardom and his moral struggles. Akasha's attempt to regain her rule over the world of Vampires is almost an afterthought.The rest of the vampire alumni included in this movie were, on paper, really rather exciting (for a vampire novel-reading geek like me). Marius, Maharet, Mekare and Armand are all included (apparently) but harshly overlooked, and dismissively underused. No time is spent on these characters at all, despite them all being some of the most important in the story and for those who haven't read the books, there's probably a certain amount of who-the-hell-are-these-guys?-syndrome happening. It's almost like the writers took a pair of garden shears to the book, put it through a blender and then filmed what was left. Yes, the sets, costumes and makeup effects are good, the Death Valley concert scene is well done, but the whole movie dithers about for 97 minutes, unsure as to whether it's following the' Queen of the Damned' or 'The Vampire Lestat' plot lines. A tad ambitious I feel. And look what happened. The movie falls flat on its face with all it's glamour, black leather, body piercings and tattoos in a heap around it. And I just want to stand pointing and laughing.

On paper her being cast probably seemed like a good draw for younger audiences familiar with her music, but in terms of her screen presence she's got a long way to go.Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and has presence, but she was totally unconvincing as the world's oldest vampire. To me she looked like Aaliyah in skimpy costumes with fangs and makeup on and any actor who played this role would have to be able to have a lot more going on internally as a performer to be convincing. It was like watching Sofia Coppolla playing Michael Corleone's daughter in Godfather III; I just cringed whenever she was on screen - no one should have ever put her in a role where she'd have to play opposite Andy Garcia; nothing against her but she just didn;t have the chops.

I found the movie stuck so true to the book that I couldn't wait to get my hands on the fairly new Queen of the Damned.I found the opening of the movie to be kind of confusing. Even though I'd read the book, I couldn't really follow it. I was highly disappointed that the vampire Lestat, who is supposed to be blonde haired and blue eyed, was dark haired and dark eyed. That would be something I could easily overlook if the rest of the movie had gone well.I found the movie totally lost the message of the book. The book was about Lestat's accidental awakening of the Queen of all vampires and the journey they go on to, in her belief, fix humanity. Meanwhile the vital story of the Twins is incorporated, as well as a few minor stories along the way that show just how much of the world is affected by the vampires and how much hold Akasha has on the fate of humanity. The movie basically focused on Lestat and Akasha's romance. The story of the Twins was touched on but not really fully explained. The character of David was totally off, not British enough, too young and a bit too harsh. And random characters were almost thrown in front of the Hollywood sign, never explaining who they were, why they appeared, or why they cared about Lestat and/or Akasha. It was just horrible to sit through.However, if I hadn't read the book, I probably would have enjoyed the movie. It was very well filmed, the casting was well done and the romantic storyline was interesting. I actually really liked the visual aspects of the movie, except for the fact that the only character who remotely looked the part was Jesse. I know many people who have seen the movie without reading the book and loved it. My overall opinion is this- if you are looking for even a minor interpretation of the book, don't see this movie. However, if you like vampire/sci-fi movies, or you aren't picky about how novels are portrayed, then go for it. If you haven't read the book, I can almost guarantee that you'll like at least some aspect of it.

Interview with the Vampire, was despite having bad casting in many roles, a good representation of that book, the mood was right, the look was right..and the story was only moderately hacked leaving most of the story intact. Queen of the damned on the other hand, was strictly to get the Gen X crowd to see Allyiah in leather and silk, Stuart Townsend shirtless, and Jonathan Davis's original songs..The story was cut to the point it wasn't the same story. Lestat's maker is NOT Marius. Where's Mekare? (the real QUEEN of the damned) Where is Louis? Why wasn't more attention paid to Khayman, who had an important role in the story...Azim...Gabrielle ...Armand, Daniel (The interviewer from Interveiw with the Vampire) Why did the Queen die in that fashion, part of what makes the real ending cool, was the fact that as powerful as the Queen was, she is killed by simple, common, mortal beheading, done as a human would do it with a large sharp pane of glass..Why did it not show the Queen Killing innocent men everywhere she went, as that was her whole purpose for waking, not Lestats music. There was no mention of how Vampires came to be, which is really the true point of the entire Queen of the Damned story. I know they couldn't leave everything in with film time constraints, but they cut out most of the important characters, and almost all of the relevant story. It's pretty, the music is decent. but its not the same story. Anne Rice was on set during IWTV. and it showed, Warner Bros. refused to allow Anne Rice any rights or say on this film, and wouldn't even allow her to come to the sets, again. It showed. The casting was bad again. Lets clear this up. Lestat is about 6 foot tall, 175lb-ish, medium length blonde hair, eves that range from blue to Gray. Not 5'6 with brown hair, and brown eyes, or 6'0 with brown hair and brown eyes. Armand is not a 40 year old Latin guy, he's about 14 human years old in appearance and is Russian, has long CURLY auburn hair and is small, and looks boy like Sorry Antonio..he's not you. Marius also has long curly hair and is roman/Anglo Saxon. Allyiah looked great, and considering she did a great job, but as an African-American, she doesn't look Egyptian... overall I feel like I just watched a pre-packaged, music video, not one of my favorite stories of all time.

However, they were also back and forth, and she broke up with him (like fifty times, but this time it seemed to be for real). So she finally agreed to watch a movie with me some Saturday night, in my home. Sex was REALLY in the air, and I had been trying to get into her pants FOREVER. Get it? FOREVER, damnit! She practically said Hey, we should have sex after that movie we're going to see.... not that she hadn't been inviting before, but with the boyfriend out of the picture and everything, I figured this had to be it. And it probably would be..So before she shows up I had to get downtown to rent a movie. I remember seeing K-PAX in the shelf, and this Queen of the Damned. I also remember reading the word erotic in a bi-sentence or something on the (Norwegian) back cover. Seemed perfect for the occasion, so I rented it.I got back home, she showed up (first and last time she set foot inside my house). We started watching the movie. Needless to say, a movie has the power to change an atmosphere completely. It can be a great way to get things going with someone. It doesn't have to be sexual or romantic, anything exciting or just funny usually gets the atmosphere right for more flirting, and so on.

The characters were poorly developed, and there were many scenes in both books that *could* have been beautifully done on-screen. Instead, there was a blatant disregard for the original story and characters. The plot is choppy and highlights Lestat's rock star image, which is only a tiny part of a much larger story.

It isn't that this movie is necessarily bad for your health, but a book can be very relaxing and certainly exercises the active part of your brain more so than this movie. You can count the number of pages by Anne Rice that I've read on one hand, but after seeing this movie and Interview with a Vampire, I get the feeling that she writes really good novels. The plots for both movies hint at a whole sea of deep and interwoven vampire history.Still, Stuart Townsend's voice-over narration gets a heck of a lot more annoying than Brad Pitt's vampire narrative ever did, and you can tell that QUEEN OF THE DAMNED's limited production resources barely give enough flesh to the Anne Rice storyline. While Interview decided to go with lace and elegance, QUEEN relies on low budget special effects that try really hard to be taken seriously. One can see that the original novel had potential as a movie and that the production team focused its attention in the wrong places. The costumes and rock & roll stage could have been replaced with more blood and an eerier soundtrack.However, I'll give credit where credit is due. The soundtrack is excellent. Korn and Disturbed had me down with the sickness bobbing my noggin like Butthead.The film opens with a very cool Goth-rock zoom & splice montage, but after the first ten minutes or so, the directing degenerates quickly. It's as if the movie was so long that the director realized that there wasn't enough time and enough money to do an Anne Rice novel justice. What results are some mediocre vampire scenes and plenty of cheesy special effects. Unfortunately, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED fails to do the genre justice just as its John Carpenter counterparts fail to impress. Where are the yellow contacts? Where's the pale blue make-up? Scene after scene, I shook my head reminiscing about the days of Salem's Lot and Fright Night when low budget was done right.There are redeeming qualities though that save this movie from being garbage. Props to Aaliyah, and may her soul forever rest in peace. She might have become a renowned actress, had her life not been taken from us so prematurely, for she did give this movie a decent performance with plenty of nice belly dancing. Did I mention that the soundtrack was good? Let's see, what else can I say? It wasn't too long. The Anne Rice novel could have easily been a three hour movie if an ambitious director like Francis Ford Coppola got his hands on it. There are a few twists and turns here and there in the plot.

I'm not sure if this is a spoiler (it doesn't seem like it), but Lestat was NOT made by Marius, he was made by MAGNUS. Magnus threw himself into a fire, and Lestat went from there to teach himself most everything he knew. And, here's what may be a spoiler towards the end of the movie -- but Jesse was NOT drained and turned by Lestat, but I believe by her aunt, Maharet. And this was only done due to acquired injuries at one of Lestat's concerts, which was also never mentioned in the movie. The rest seemed okay, but those were two huge factors that greatly bothered me. Other than that, it just seemed like the movie script left out fantastic parts of the novel that I would've loved to have seen acted out in the movie.~K~ "},{"Title":"Aaliyah's Movie","Date":"22 January 2005","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Aaliyah blows all the female cast members out of the water, including the official love interest Marguerite Moreau.I would have loved to see this movie play out as Akasha's power trip.

I could sum it up in a lovely gagging noise. Not only was the acting intolerable, but it was like they didn't even bother with reading the book. The book itself was never structurally made to be brought to the screen. The concept of a vampire rising from his 'sleep' to join a rock band, simply works better in writing then in moving pictures. Even if Tom Cruise himself hadn't passed over the role, it still would not even have risen near acceptable. Tom Cruise was Lestat without a doubt. Townsend pretty much destroyed the character! He raped Lestat of his personality, his cunning, his wit, and every other trait we've come to adore him for. Townsend turned Lestat into nothing more than a jerk with an ego problem and a lust for groupie blood. Other characters were also maimed in the making of this film. Marius's portrayal especially made me cringe. In the books, Marius is a LONG BLONDE haired, BLUE eyed roman man. NOT, and I repeat NOT a short dark haired, brown eyed Spanish man!! I love Vincent Perez, he did wonderfully in The City of Angels...but failed miserably in Queen of the Damned. Now another blaring moment, is that fact that a good share of main characters are MISSING. Louis and Armand do not make a reappearance. Gabrielle is gone. Maharet's sister is missing. Or in some cases characters were diminished. I believe I saw Mael at some point, but he was never given a name. Same with Pandora. I only knew she was in the movie because the credits told me so. Well there is so much more I could detail, but there is a word limit. Strictly speaking Queen of the Damned fell so far behind its predecessor that I don't blame Stuart Townsend for basically disappearing off the face of the earth. Interview with the Vampire is still the best, and probably always will be. If you have questions, read the book. You'll hate the movie too after that.

A movie about an ancient vampire going rogue and becoming a rock star, well, that's right up there with Attack of the Killer Tomatoes. The fact that Aaliyah would be playing the title role was not comforting, nor were the previews, which showed extended shots of Aaliyah eating a still-beating heart. And still I pushed aside my doubts, reminded myself that Interview with the Vampire hadn't been too bad, and forked over the five dollars for a ticket to Queen of the Damned. I was surprised not to be surprised.Queen of the Damned is exactly what it sounds like--a group of pretty actors and actresses (and singers) vying for the position of most ridiculous role. Whether it's Stuart Townsend's laughable portrayal of the dangerous Lestat (who, I had thought, was supposed to be French--I suppose one must disregard Townsend's lisping, almost Germanic attempt at an accent) or Marguerite Moreau's bland performance as the enigmatic Jesse, watching this movie was rather like watching a train crash. It's violent and painful, but you just can't look away.The hardest part about writing this review is looking at the ratings, and finding that the lowest one possible is a 1.

Each one from Lestat to Pandora to Marius, had their own inner battles that served as an umbilical cord to their humanity. That along with the rich historic origins of vampirism exquisitely detailed from vampire to vampire, lent an aura of romanticism that few other writers could develop. The book, Queen of the Damned, connected the past with the present and introduced us to the group of immortals who hold the survival of fellow vampires in their hands. Queen of the Damned the movie, on the other hand, is just plain bad. From acting, writing, casting, directing, all facets of this exercise, which in essence is just a music video, utterly and miserably fail. After years of hibernation, Lestat awakes in the 20th century and decides to come clean and cause a ruckus as he usually does. This he does by writing an autobiography (the Vampire Lestat) and joining a rock band and thereby announcing to the world the secret of the cabal. This, as you can imagine is not taken lightly by the other bloodsuckers who revel in their nonexistence, living on the fringes of society. The vampire nation decides it's time that Lestat shuts up forever. At the same time, Akasha, literally the mother of all vampires, is also awakened and decides to enforce her vision of utopia on the suspecting world. Never have I seen such a bland, untalented, and unmotivated group of actors. Stuart Townsend plays a wooden and stiff Lestat who seems bored except when on stage. Aaliyah is truly miscast as Akasha. The scene where she enters a vampire bar is pure comedy. The few actors of substance like Lena Olin, are barely given any screen time. The dialogue is reminiscent of a cartoon. There are far too many vampire bar scenes where fashion attire is the only reason the scenes were shot. Black leather and heavy makeup, this is a good advert for the goth-look but nothing more. It&#129;fs image and style over content and substance. It's no wonder that Anne Rice disassociated herself from it. There seems to be a slew of directors from the MTV music video school of film making and though some learn enough to eventually make a decent film, the majority are better suited for commercials or even better yet, music videos. As long as it looks good, then it's fine. Eye candy works for a 5 minute music video but not for a 2.0hrs film. I didn't expect them to follow the storyline which is fine but it's clear that they chose this route only to appeal to the younger audiences in the same way they cast Townsend and Aaliyah. Demographically, I don't think the majority of Anne Rice's readers are teenagers. The only positive reviews I read, extol the beauty and looks of Townsend and Aailyah as reasons for liking the movie. Sorry but that's not enough for me and many others. I have made a note of those involved in this fiasco from the director to producers and will avoid anything they are involved in like the bubonic plague.

The plot has been changed far too much, for reasons that aren't really good enough to be forgiven. The book is such a mix of many different plots and ideas, they couldn't all be included. Akasha's character is not developed enough and the exclusion of Mekare doesn't really work, however hard they have tried.However, the one theme it does focus on it brings out superbly the Lestat the rock-star idea. Stuart Townsend is perfectly cast for this (as for having the wrong hair colour, just get over it) and the Jonathan Davis has done a fantastic job with both the source music and his first ever film score. Stuart Townsend's incarnation of Lestat the rock God is enthralling, sexy and magnetic, which saves this film. Aliyah's Akasha was brilliant - for such a young actress she embodied a 400 year old Egyptian Queen remarkably. Shame we won't get to see her in other roles. She has left behind such indications of potential.If you're not too much of an Anne Rice fundamentalist, and you can put the books behind you, you can enjoy this film.

In using a largely unknown cast, the characters have a freshness absent in Neil Jordan's Interview with the Vampire, where Brad Pitt was an especially inappropriate choice as Louis. Stuart Townsend is really quite good as Lestat, certainly physically, although he is a tad wooden. I thank god he didn't have a New York drawl.Premature death always elevates the mediocre and deifies the talented, but it is not an exaggeration to say that Aaliyah is pretty sensational as Akasha (the Queen) here, if you forgive her the cod Transylvanian accent.The problems predictably occur in the plot, which is messy and confusing, although the pacing and tension are reasonable. Akasha's goal is poorly sketched as some kind of world domination. In the novel she has a much less nebulous and more grotesque vision, which propels the action in a far more effective way. Stripped of any plausible context, the denouement lets the film down badly, with Lestat's motivations particularly baffling.Over all, some evocative sequences, good special effects and visual richness mean the movie can be enjoyed on the 'sensual' level Rice works best on - meaning that, ironically, fans of the books may enjoy it more than most. Out in the real world, the return of rock as a credible source of cool of late has also enabled this movie to appear vibrant and relevant in a way not possible five or ten years ago.

So i have to thank it, even though it twisted the story beyond recognition.But to tell you guys the truth, i wasnt a big fan of the book. In fact, its my least favorite book in the entire series. And had they covered all they had in the novel, i would have been bored to tears! To be quite honest with you, i dont care about Khayman, or many of the others.Im all for Lestat , as im sure many of the fans are. The one thing that toasted me about the movie was that they fused two characters. Yes, you know what im talking about all you readers. Marius and Magnus were made into one person.Another thing is, how hard would it have been to dye their hair blonde? Marius was supposed to have long beautiful straight blonde hair, and Lestats was to be a wavey gold. Also i think they shouldve expanded on the story with the twins past with akasha and enkil. But to tell you the truth, that bored me too.People were also complaining about stuart townsend. Frankly , i like the guy. And despite other comments about Tom Cruise, i liked him as Lestat too. To be perfectly honest, ive not seen an actor who looks like i imagined my Lestat.To finish this off, i'd like to say that no one even heard about this movie coming out until Aaliyah died. I was knee deep in a conversation with a relative of mine how they thought it was 'manipulative of hollywood to put it out and milk on peoples sympathy for her death'. I didnt see it that way at all.If she took the time from her busy schedule (and you know it was busy), and wanted to do the movie, she wouldve wanted it to be put out into the public. It was low budget, i assume (by costuming), so theres no doubt that someone had offered her other parts for more money.And it was a laid back flick with all good elements.

I don't care; I just saw this awful excuse for a movie, and I am going to try my best to keep others from making my mistake! I have loved Anne Rice since shortly after Interview With A Vampire (the movie) came out.  Tom Cruise's portrayal of Lestat, in particular, drew me into the story.  Now, true, the character Louis was hard to get behind (accurate to the book; Louis IS kind of a whiner) and Antonio Banderas, though he portrayed Armand beautifully, was physically about as inappropriate for the role as possible, and the end was a major departure from the book, but the movie held true to the general plot and personalities and feel of Anne Rice's world. Not so with Queen of the Damned.  It seems like the scriptwriters barely gave a nod to the plot; they borrowed the names of characters, but didn't even bother with their actual personalities; they took bits and pieces of some of the most insignificant bits of the book, without bothering with what was really important; they inserted ridiculous things that manufactured themselves. For you who have not read, and probably will not read, Anne Rice, let me clarify a few of the most glaring points for you.  We'll start with Lestat. Lestat is a vampire.  A self-proclaimed monster.  He's not a nice guy. But he also drinks only the blood of the evil doer.  I wouldn't call the poor girls he was chasing around in the movie evil doers.  And Lestat is in love with humanity.  Not just Jesse; he loves the members of his band, he loves David, he loves humans he comes into contact with.  Humanity fascinates him.Oh.  And he can't fly.  Sorry to burst your bubble, but that doesn't happen until AFTER he becomes Akasha's playboy. As a note, I do think that with a better script, and a better idea of what he was doing, Stuart Townsend might have been as good a Lestat as Tom Cruise; maybe even better.  As it was, he failed hard. Then there's David.  You don't see much of our boy David in the movie, which is ok.  The little we saw of him, he was even well-portrayed.  Except one little thing.  Insignificant, really, except that it's an essential part of the character.  David is in his 70's.  Hello?!  The words I'm too old coming out of that actor's mouth are...  Ridiculous. Then of course, there's Marius.  What did these butchers masquerading as screenwriters do to our lovely artist, our Roman scholar?  They turned him into some sort of ...  villain!  Anyone who has read Vampire Lestat would cringe...  To someone who actually read the book ABOUT Marius, his portrayal was perhaps the most painful of all.  And to clarify a few key plot points related to Marius; he is NOT Lestat's maker.  Teacher, perhaps, friend certainly, but not his maker.  Moreover, Marius was trapped under tons of ice for most of the duration of Queen of the Damned; trapped by Akasha when she escaped so that he would not be able to interfere. And Akasha...  Aaliyah was great as Akasha.  She was just as I'd pictured her, and the only reason I gave this movie two stars instead of just one. But, for the record, Akasha and Enkil were not actually statues.  Their skin looked like marble, but not their clothes or eyes or hair or whatever. They had color, but the morons who wrote the screenplay apparently missed this. Jesse, along with Maharet and the other ancients, is such a two-dimensional character in this movie I won't even go into them, except to say that it's sad that such characters so essential to the plot were so ignored.  And when Lestat originally drank from Akasha, it was not Akasha who pushed him away; in fact, he was nearly KILLED by a jealous Enkil, and only just saved by Marius' intervention. Now, a few notes about vampire lore.  In the vampire club, when Jesse goes in looking for Lestat, claiming a relationship with the ancient Marius, one of the vampires tells her all of the ancients are dead.  There is a reason for this belief.  Just before Marius' time, Akasha and Enkil, her king, were dragged out into the sun by their keeper, in a bid to end their existence. While Akasha and Enkil only acquired a deep tan, because Akasha, who was the mother of ALL vampires, was burned, so every single other vampire was burned.  New vampires were immolated; older vampires didn't die, but existed in agony.  Their kind was nearly wiped out before the royal pair was dragged from the sun.  Akasha's blood did NOT bequeath Lestat the ability to walk in the sunlight with no fear.  If Akasha had actually walked into the sun, or through the fire, most of the vampiric population would have exploded into flame.  And for Lestat, though after drinking Akasha's blood, sunlight would no longer kill him, it still certainly isn't pleasant. Last of all, worst of all, is the plot.  The scriptwriters took the most insignificant scene and turned it into the bulk of the movie.  Lestat's awakening and discovering of rock music isn't even IN Queen of the Damned, it's in The Vampire Lestat.  Moreover, that and the later battle comprise of perhaps two chapters, one out of each book.  And yet in the movie, it's more than three quarters of the story!  The rich history of the vampires is never touched on, even though it's the bulk of the plot in the book.  It's vaguely mentioned that whoever drinks the last drop of Akasha's blood won't survive, but not why; they don't mention that if Akasha dies, all vampires die. And where is Mekere, Maharet's dumb (as in, tongue was cut out, not as in stupid) sister, the one who eventually took Akasha's essence into herself? Where is Akasha's quest to eliminate most men, to elevate women and establish herself as their goddess?  Gone.  Not even touched on. Perhaps, if you never read the book, this is a watchable movie.  But flashy special effects and attractive stars are no substitute for the depth of story that a movie like this COULD have had.  Don't waste your time, don't waste your money - don't watch this movie.

Impossible.  Although it was less depressing and more fun than the first, it was rather obvious that the editors had a difficult time editing the movie and having it flow from scene to scene.  After watching the deleted scenes on DVD, I think they would have been better off leaving the scenes in and just sacrifice their pacing issues for the half understood plot issues that developed due to their editing.No offense to Tom Cruise, but I thought Stuart Townsend did a more accurate job playing Lestat (in looks if not in attitude).  Aaliyah was amazingly wicked and beautiful as the Queen of All Vampires, Akasha. Whether it was the way she would stride into a scene or the dance number she performed (check the deleted scenes for the full number), she was completely believable.  Vincent Perez equally caught my eye, playing an ancient vampire, Marius, and Lestat's maker (in Hollywood's interpretation only). His performance was equally believable and showed the depth of a vampire who's been around since the B.C.To sum it up, it was more enjoyable to watch than the first, but due to poor editing and script problems, don't expect to fully understand the plot. The deleted scenes help to alleviate this problem but they just needed to spend more time writing the script if they were going to combine these two novels.

It was an erotic film, and Aaliyah was quite seductive.   3.  It was disappointing in that important scenes were cut from the movie.  (Where did these people learn to edit a movie??  Why in the world they cut out the introductory scenes for the ancient vampires, in addition to a few other important scenes?  Before I saw the DVD feature about the scenes cut from the movie, I had to guess who Armand, etc. was.)   4.  The soundtrack kicked ass.   As with any movie, it was different than the novel.  For example, Lestat could not fly until he drank enough of Akasha's blood in the 20th Century.  At least the movie wasn't as gay as the novel.All in all, it was an excellent movie.  If you had to decide between the DVD and VCR formats, purchase the DVD version.

The visuals were great, though Interview still stands as the greatest Vampire film of all time, this one runs definitely in the top ten. "}{"Title":"Anne Rice it ain't, good?

This is a story based on two books (The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned), and is one version of them. Parts have been changed, left out and not mentioned to give you a whole story and to fit in the time allowed.However, i REALLY enjoyed this film. I am a big fan of Anne Rice and the difference in the story didn't matter to me at all (e.g. one change being who sired Lestat). The settings were well constructed, and i could really see Lestat on the screen. I think that Stuart Townsend really caught Lestat's character, how he wants to exist in both the supernatural and the natural, much more than Tom Cruise did. I found that the people playing the vampire characters were like how i imagined, with only few changes there.Some of the acting by lesser characters was questionable, sort of stiff, but these are not on the screen long enough to really ruin the film.I especially liked how the movements were made to seem more supernatural than those of humans, some may call it flashy effects, but i think that it showed how different vampires are, especially in the 'feeding scenes'.The one thing i would warn against is for people not to expect normal vampire films, this is not Buffy or Blade. Those are made up of 'evil vampires kill good humans, so good humans kill evil vampires', this isn't like that. This film, and the book, are about how the vampires live, what happens to them, evil or good. This film, for me gave a feeling like that only one part of a long story had been told, which is how it should be, what with Vampires living forever.As i have said i really liked this film, which i was happy about since i had heard a lot of critics (mostly middle aged men who this film is not aimed at) say how bad and stupid it was. I think it was a good way of escaping to another world for a couple of hours, which is the whole point of films.I give Queen of the Damned a big thumbs up!

If you haven't read the books, the movie gives you enough history that you can follow along the storyline. If you have read the books, then you finally get to see the atmosphere and hear the voices that until now have been ghostly echoes in our heads. Stuart Townsend was perfect as Lestat.

The story on which the movie is based on, is very interesting and offers a possibility of a dramatical, visually powerful Vampire flic.Well, and after that, most things went wrong.First of all, the script is BAD. Scenes which could be giving dramatic thrills are scripted to boredom or even TOTALLY OMITTED! Akasha's second awakening, for example, is brought into the story by Marius saying 'Oh well, yeah, she just woke up, y'know...' This is NOT dramatic. In other moments, the dialogue is so stupid you don't have the slightest idea of what is going on, for example when the part with the Family Tree is 'explained'.Secondly, there are only two people in this movie which could be called 'actors' (Townsend and Perez) and they, well, 'do their best'. Aaliyah just shows her body and beckons around in her stupid accent and could as well just be replaced with an animated character from Final Fantasy. The rest of the actors are, on the main, forgettable. Marguerite Moreau simply makes you wanna run out of the cinema and does make you think about Lestat's motives How can he want to spend eternity with this BORING BORING person? The actor quality does the part to the film which is the greatest sin for a movie wanting to have some drama You don't care about anyone, except maybe for Lestat. Even the beach covered with corpses does only make you feel glad you didn't experience them alive, 'cos they probably would have been bad actors, too.I gave this movie 5 out of 10 because, well, Townsend tries REALLY hard, and I really liked the music part (Jonathan Davis does a good bit here). Besides, the scene with thousands of fans approaching the concert is stunning. The movie design is also very good.Well, maybe the next Chronicles movie is made by the right people. I DO hope so.

I think that many people, who like the books, got swept into them into the fun historical milieu and eroticism.  Jordan's film took itself a little seriously and tried to draw that world in too much detail.  This movie knows that the immediate appeals of this novel are the classics of escapism youthful sexuality, delusions of grandeur, and big effect violence. Viewers want all of these and want them serving some simple didactic theme.  In this case, even an egotistic cruel vampire, like Lestat, can have a shred of humanity and will make the choice to serve humanity's best interest (even though to him they are an amusement). The new faces in the cast were good. Aaliyah looks great, but her dialogue was a little flat, nonetheless she shows the same charismatic potential that River Phoenix and Tupac Shakur showed and her untimely death, like theirs, means that her talents will be forever represented as ripening.  I liked Stuart Townsend, his Lestat was sexier and more charismatic than that other fellow who played the part years back. I liked Marguerite Moreau and Vincent Perez but felt that more of their work may have ended up on the cutting room floor.  Not enough of Lena Olin! I wished that they had attended a little more to Louis and some of their backstory (a mention of Claudia and Armand might have been nice.) The presentation of the goths was interesting. I wonder how many of them will see this film and realize that most of them are more like the naieve or dorky characters who the vampires denigrate, than they are like vampires themselves.  Basically, where the novels Interview and Lestat were fun pseudo-history and pseudo-biography, Queen was a little soapy and glitzy. The movie is an eye-candy version of  a word-candy book ... not too nutritious but sensationally satisfying.

And then there's a human girl, Jesse Reeves (Marguerite Moreau) in love with Lestat...The film really works.  It has two great scary moments--one when Lestat attacks and kills two girls and a fantastic, violent vampire vs. vampires at a Death Valley concert.  Great special effects, flashy camerawork (love how they show the vampires flying), some good acting but the plot has serious problems.  There's way too much for one movie and there are obvious cuts in the film (I'm guessing for time) that render the last section incomprehensible.  I was able to (sort of) follow it but it ruins what could have been a really great vampire film.Stuart Townsend looks good as Lestat (a definite improvement over Tom Cruise) but his acting is only so-so.  He doesn't hurt the film but he doesn't help either.  The late Aaliyah is very good as Akasha--she's sexy, slinky and scary.  There's a scene of her eating a still beating human heart that won't leave me.  However it's Vincent Perez who steals the movie as Marius (the vampire who made Lestat).  He's obviously enjoying himself and it shows.So, it's worth seeing--much better than Interview with the Vampire.

As an avid fan of the Vampire Chronicle books by Anne Rice, I wonder how she ever allowed her name to be put on such complete and utter crap.The absolute plot inconsistencies are completely ridiculous.  It is as if the writers took the book, read it, and threw it out the window before beginning the screenplay.  I would understand some small omissions in order to condense a long book into a movie, but drastically changing the integral plot points (such as individual vampires' makers, lovers, and friends) is completely inexcusable.There were only 2 things that I can even imagine complimenting in this movie.  First, the soundtrack.  With bands like Disturbed, Orgy, and Korn on board, the driving rock of The Vampire Lestat was perfectly set.  Second the performance of Stuart Townshend was terrific.  As I read the books, I formed a mental picture of Lestat.  Tom Cruise wasn't it.  Stuart Townshend was. From the patterns of speech to the latent sexuality, to the dark beauty, he was everything Anne Rice described in her hero Lestat.

Anyways, it was an entertaining flick, and a chance to reunite with familiar characters despite the train wreck they made out of the plot. Rice purists will have a lot to gripe about after seeing this one. Fans of Interview with the Vampire should not expect QotD to be the same flick. First of all, it's a completely different movie with different director and cast. Second, Interview is told from Louis's point of view and is told with his tone.

The style was great, especially the whole  Kabinett des Doktor Caligari theme to the Lestat videos and stage show.  It doesn't take itself too horribly serious, either, which should be apparent during the vampire battle during the Death Valley show.  The only part that I thought took away from the film was the whole Talamasca bit.  It just seemed to be in there to help explain so many things that couldn't more easily be crammed into an hour and forty minutes.  So, it was kinda weak, but necessary for production's sake.

You will also be somewhat foolish - we all know that it is be nigh on impossible to create the depth of character, landscape, background & mythology in film that one finds in any good novel, let alone novels as densely written as the divine Ms Rice's.If, however, you have the basic common-sense to expect a film loosely based on the Anne Rice novels, you may well enjoy yourself.One reviewer has noted their annoyance at the accents used by certain members of the cast.  In my humble opinion, it seems reasonable that a French nobleman would have a French accent; a Roman would have a Latin accent; an Egyptian would have an African/Arabic accent.  And, of course, as any non-American can tell you, whether or not an accent is irritating is purely subjective.As in any film, there are times when more information on a character, motivation, or background would have been nice.  In this film, more information on Akasha herself would have been invaluable.  Aaliyah (Akasha) herself is shamefully under-used, it's true; however, Stuart Townsend (Lestat)fairly burns up the screen.  Vincent Perez's (Marius) wisdom & puritanical adherence to the rules clashes beautifully with his desire for mortal contact (& obsession with red velvet).  Marguerite Moreau (Jesse) thinks she knows what she wants, but her romanticism cannot withstand a dose of reality.The lack of reference to the history & role of the Talamasca, information about Davaid Talbot, & explaination of Akasha's origins & powers weaken the film.  That said, there is much to enjoy here* Lestat's realisation that the 'MTV-age' is the best possible era for an egotistical vampire to exist in * His revelry in public adoration & notoriety * Marius's jealousy & internal moral wrangling * Maharet's quiet authority * Jesse's panic when faced with the reality of vampirism * Akasha's amusement at Lestat's ego * The tongue-in-cheek observations of the rockstar-fan relationship; our cultural refusal to believe in the supernatural whilst being obsessed with the idea of power beyond our ken; the entertainment industry's identification with the vampire * The sumptuous sets, costumes, make-up, & effects.To summarise Don't go expecting Anne Rice.

Then I found out how many changes they had made, and I was a bit peeved. There are moments when the speed of the rock videos interspersed throughout the 100 minutes seems to be fighting against some drag in the story. I have a feeling that if the script writers had cut some of the longer camera pans and taken that extra time and another twenty minutes, not only could they have been more faithful to the book (the Legend of the Twins, some more character history), but they also could have fleshed out some more of the characters, especially Akasha, who lacks the complexity that made her such an interesting and seductive villain in the book.That being said, I give the film makers this defense I have a feeling that while a good percentage of the people coming to see this film will be Anne Rice fans, another percentage will be fans of the late Alliyah, a group who I doubt (1) have even HEARD of The Vampire Chronicles, (2) would understand the poetry that made the book so intoxicating, and (3) have the attention span to sit for those additional twenty minutes, much less read the book.Let us, therefore, remove the movie from the book, and look at what was good the pace, though slow at times, did have enough moments to keep you enraptured and get your heart pounding. The camera work helps transport us into the world of the vampire. The story (there ARE elements of the book present) worked and flowed, connecting and explaining most of the questions it posed.As was said above, the characters and their histories could have been established a bit more, but what was there was good. The concerned and wise David Talbot (McGann), the pure passion and power of Akasha, and the weary but ever fighting fatherly figure of Marius (Perez) all transfer to the screen well. While disappointed at the lack of development from Armand (Newton), Pandora (Black), Mael (Manon), Khayman (Spence), and especially Maharet (an albeit luminous Olin), and the complete lack of Gabrielle, Louis, and others, I must give kudos to Stewart Townsend and Marguerite Moreau.The chemistry between the two was AMAZING and one of the best points of the movie. Of everything that was changed from the book, this is perhaps the best and the choice I agree with the most. The conflict, love, and passion between Lestat and Jesse drives the movie and even manages to slip in some of Anne Rice's messages from the book.If you are an Anne Rice fan and you go expecting a near word for word adaption as was seen in Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for something that takes rich characters, plays with them, and creates a fun and (at times) truly intoxicating movie, then spend the money and trust that The Queen of the Damned will take you on a journey you may not want to come back from.

The music, not only the rock music, is really good, even though I don't usually listen to Korn (the lead singer wrote and performed most of the rock music).Anyways, I never saw Interview with a Vampire, and I don't plan on doing so, Tom Cruise as Lestat? The picture I saw of him was hilarious, I laughed, I also luaghed at the thought that he might have played Lestat in this film.Overall I liked it.

The scene in the modern-day vampire bar when she comes slinking in in her archaic glory is iconic when the young male vampire approaches and threatens her, she calmly rips his heart right out of his chest and starts to eat it ... Admittedly, the ensuing attack on her by modern-day vampire posers whom she handily dispatches is filmed in a less than convincing manner--for me these details are overwhelmed by the presence of this electrifying woman. Also, Anne Rice's idea to turn Lestat into a rock star was a stroke of brilliance that is acted out convincingly in this film. This movie is far more worthwhile than the film adaptation of Interview with a Vampire. Aaliyah lives! "},{"Title":"Very good movie...

I am not a goth, emo or that kind of a fake-person, I dress up in hip hop pants, shirt, and like this kind of music like in the movie.

He sings way different from the songs. But the way that the movie is built on is great, the persons in the movie has very good character and how they saved the movie when Aaliah died in a harmful car accident, by faking her with some computer effects is just unbelievable.I would say that this movie isn't for everyone, specially not those who can't stand blood, supernatural things, vampires, a.s.o.

Lestat (Stuart Townsend) has recently woke up from a long period time of sleep and has decided to betray his vampire oath by revealing himself to a band. When he becomes a popular movie icon his fellow vampires, understadebly, go mad and plot his death. Meanwhile Jesse (Marguerite Moreau) a orphaned member of the supernatural studies, who has an ancient vampire family tree, has become deeply obsessed with Lestat. Her boss David (Paul McGann) understands her obsession and revaeals his obsession with the vampire Marius, (Vincent Perez)who is an ancient vampire and the man who made Lestat a vampire too. Jesse is given Lestats diary and reads of his first killing and an encounter with the Queen of the Damned- Akasha (Aaliyah). When Lestat holds a concert in Death Valley he receives news that not only will angry vampires be there Akasha may come as well. Meanwhile Akasha has other plans. She goes to a vampire coven, a bar, and kills everyone in her path. With Lestat tempted with royality and loving care by Akasha the ancient vampires consisting of Marius and Jesses Aunt Maharet (Lena Olin) plot against them.

Akasha, mother of all vampires played by the sexy Aaliyah, is not the least bit rusty in her ancient bones and could have been born yesterday - and what happened to her dark-feminist (book) plot to kill or enslave every male on the planet to stop humanity from destroying itself? Pandora and Armand are not even recognizable, but most of all the great Maharet (and her entirely left-out sister Mekare) whose story made up the red string of the novel is not a fraction as impressive as she could be. But then it would be a different film (one to which Rice would have written the script, supposing she didn't because of the above), and maybe one as dark and fraught with tragedy as its predecessor.Instead, this is thrilling, funny and sexy entertainment, and you won't leave the theater feeling depressed. I bought the soundtrack right away, but the music surely isn't to everyone's taste. The story focuses on Jessie of the Talamasca who tracks down Lestat and in the end is made a vampire by him (and they live together happily ever after). The prince of darkness appears more human than ever - bored by immortality, lonely and desperately reckless, this Lestat is dead only on the outside. He plunges into the remote-public guise of a rock star to draw out other vampires - better dead than alone is his motto. Their human-vampiric love affair starts out as mutual fascination with each other's boldness. While all back-row vampires in the movie are over-made-up caricatures, Aaliyah-Akasha is truly frightening - and very believable as a powerful, spoiled half-goddess that rips apart anyone she likes to, though not an old-Egyptian one (as far as we know, ancient queens didn't try to always act in the most sexy way).The end of the movie is the disappointing part - Maharet's ragged band of involuntarily funny creatures sucks beautiful Akasha dry, after traitorous Lestat has drained her enough for them to overpower her. She disperses in a cloud of golden dust, a special effects feast - but seems like it didn't take that much to get rid of her after all. More like a storm in a teacup, compared with Anne Rice's mountainous final struggle. So, 9 out of the 10 it would otherwise have been.I love Anne Rice's books, and I like the first film adaptation, but I think this movie has been treated unfairly in judging it by Lord of the Rings standards. The authors apparently thought that one and a half hours are not enough to deliver more than a snapshot of the Queen of the Damned epic, and they're right. So they based their version loosely on it and made up a new core of their own. Oddly enough this Lestat resembles the one in the novels very much, and Steward Townsend plays him with a funny snobby style full of self-irony that truly brings the voice from the pages to life.

Somebody tried to insult QotD calling it a 1,5h music video clip. Actually it is a complement. The everpresent gothic music combined with the music-video-like shots made the movie so moody - and Queen of the Damned is a mood-driven story.I do not understand the die hard fans who complain on the modifications of the story. The plot has been modified to be less confusing for viewers who do not know the novels. The number of characters had been lessened and I have no problems with changing Lestat's maker or skipping Mekare's character. The biggest change - the romance of Lestat and Jesse - seemed a very nice addition to me.Actually, I think that a faithful adaptation would be a complete failure. The slow and gloomy mood, that was perfect to XIXth century New Orlean and Louis's angst, wouldn't fit Lestat's rebellion and his music. And while the book can be slow, descriptive and combining multiple elements yet conveying them well, the movie simply cannot do it without turning chaotic. Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned can be split into at least three movies - the creators had to choose something.Some of the special effects, like the flying or walking out of the flames were the only thing I actually didn't like in this movie. But Akasha's death was very nice. The cast was good, Stuard Townsend was convincing as Lestat, especially on the concert, but I preferred Banderas as Armand. I loved Jesse, Maharet and Marius though. And of course Aaliyah was perfect with her quasi-ancient-Egyptian accent.So if you are into gothic music and vampiric dillemas of loneliness and eternity (and you don't consider books to be movie scenarios) Queen of the Damned is one of the few movies which show vampires as something more than blood sucking monsters. But please do not compare it to the Interview movie. It has a completely different style, precisely as much different as different were Louis and Lestat. Personally I find it thrilling first to watch a vampire's existence from Louis' bottled hunger point of view, and then switching to one devoid of all morals but surprisingly outgoing for a vampire, Lestat.I'd give Queen 8 of 10 as it had some technical flaws, but I decided to give it 9 as it's vastly underrated by people who hate it simply because it didn't match their vision of the books, which can be clearly seen by looking at the votes breakdown.

After reading Queen of the Damned, the book written by Anne Rice, I was so ecstatic to be finally seeing the movie. But as the movie progressed, that ecstasy that I felt for the book turned into disappointment for this movie.BOOK vs MOVIE As we all know, whenever books are made into movies, most of those movies, are nothing like what they're supposed to be and this one is the same with them. It's really really different from the book. Its plot wasn't copied, I think that they just used the book for names and such. And also, the book is a masterpiece, compiled and put together by one of the smartest being on earth. If you were turned off by this movie and opted to not read the book, then you are so missing a very great chapter in your life!STORYLINE It was bogus. Anybody could make that up. A story where the main lead (ML) was lonely needed somebody, found that special someone (SS), said bogus line, but was caught in the net of someone, not quite beautiful but more of a s*** (S), if you know what I mean. Then S is bad who wants SS to die by the hands of ML who turns back on S. LOOOONG story short, SS and ML live happily ever 'till death do them part, which is unlikely since we ALL know that they live forever. EFFECTS I was expecting more, since hello, DUH!!! These are the Warner Bros. we're talking about! I mean a year before they made the greatest movie ever! Harry Potter with very, VERY awe-inspiring effects. Then we just get crappy burning effects and decomposing, audiences doubled in the concert arena and don't forget the flying and jumping and grabbing hold of their so-called victims. Oh wait, that last part when the spirit inside Akasha went out and it was like doing the atom-like movements around her, it was almost okay, almost that is.CHARACTERS If you are particular to the vampire world, authors would usually say that they are the most beautiful creature that roam the world, that wherever they go if not concealed turns heads around, not literal of course, but the only person who was beautiful was Lestat aka Stuart Townsend. Jesse (M. Moreau) was beautiful too, just that she was better looking when she was still alive and not in her vampiric state. I don't know what to make of their acting since I do not really know on how to judge it, but one thing's for sure, Stuart Townsend is the best looking vampire actor in the world who beats Edward(Rob Pattinson) hands down! And Townsend is better at acting too.TOTAL All in all, if you're intrigued, I'd rather you just watch it online, no need to get out of your house to go out and rent it for you're just wasting your time. But, as I've said before if you're interested about the whole queen rising up again and rocker vamp next to her, go and look for the book, it's worth it and there are tons of lessons to learn from this book. OTHER COMMENT I wish that they'd make another movie out of this. They'll follow the real sequence that was in the book, find more people who are pleasing to the eyes to play the parts of the vampire people. And that they use Townsend again to play as Lestat with his cool and angelic voice that sounds demonic which doesn't make sense but if you listen to him you'll understand.

I mean for Stuart Townsed was genius as vampire. And Jessee was great and Marius and the girl with violin. If you really think about it, it is very sentimental, romantic and about someone who is lost for so long and found by love at the end. It is so cliché and so predictable, but also it is very controversial, because of the music that is provided.I think you will all agree that QoTDhas one of the best soundtracks ever. For me personally it was a start of being addicted to that kind of music. It is shame that didn't find an actor who could actually sing, I believed Stuart when he was singing. I can't imagine for example Jonathan Davis to be Lestat even though he sings his songs. Also we had Chester from LP, Deftones or Marilyn Manson. It was really incredible.

At first when I heard they were making a movie on Anne Rice's third book I prayed they don't take Tom Cruz again for the role of The Vampire Lestat and thank god they didn't and thank god again they chose Stuart Townsend. After reading 3 books in which The Vampire Lestat had featured, I had formed a definite image of him in my mind, of a bold but very sensitive immortal and Stuart Townsend's performance as The Vampire Lestat is the best performance as a vampire I have ever seen while that of Vincent Perez as Marius is severely lacking - nowhere in the movie does he manage to portray himself as an ancient Vampire and being superior to Lestat in elegance and power of character and his performance is one of the shortcomings of the film. Coming to other things, after seeing the movie for the first time I felt disappointed that they changed many things from the chronicles but at the same time, I did not fail to appreciate how so many other things like the spirit of Anne Rice's tales were still there in the movie and the music they included was simply spectacular. If The Vampire Lestat were real and would make a musical album he might write the exact same one. As for things being changed I understand their reasons.. Anne Rice's chronicles of Vampires is too huge a tale and there's no way they could cram every thing in a 2 hour movie. They had to include the essence of it and still have it make sense and changing a few things here and there had to be done.As for the special effects, it does look artificial at times and is a little too excessive, they should have relied less on it and relied more on the old disappearing from one place to another instead of showing them blurringly flying perhaps. Anne Rice did however explicitly state that her Vampires were capable of all this and it was an attempt to be as true to the book as is possible.

But most of the time it turns out like Queen of the damned unwatchable.Lestat (you know, the character from Interview with the vampire) wakes up and needs a way to cope with todays society. He decides to become a rock star, and his music wakes up the Queen of the damned. A vampire queen that has been asleep for centuries, now she wants to rule the earth with Lestat as her husband.This movie displays almost everything that is wrong with Vampire movies. The acting first of all is terrible. Everyone walks around trying painfully hard to look cool in leather and rubber, most of them using thick fake accents since apparently no Vampire has ever learned to speak proper English. Worst here is Vincent Perez as the man who made Lestat a Vampire. Second of all it always seems that every film-maker doing a Vampire-movie has to try and introduce some sexual tension. Apparently Vampires are very seductive and alluring, something that the actors are usually completely inept at portraying. Stuart Townsend as Lestat falls completely flat in his attempt.There has been much talk about Aaliyah and this film since it was her last role before her tragic death. But it's hard to comment her performance considering she was not actually on screen very much. Her thick accent was not flattering though and personally i wish she would have had something other than this as her last performance.There is so much i could write about why you should stay away from this movie.

Whatever that was as being too cold and humourless and not her Lestat but these teeny boppers (Oh, dear, I'm labelling) can't accept that and latch on to what they consider to be a pretty face. Townsend wasn't playing Lestat. He was playing Dracula in a leather coat but I could rant for hours about that.When Tom Cruise played Lestat in Interview with The Vampire there was layers to the personality. The pleading look as he asks 'Do we forgive each other then?' The way he worried for Louis as Louis ran out into the rain, the way he saved Louis from the fire, the angst the personality it was all there.WIth Stuart Townsend you had nothing. The acting was wooden. Shallow. And even if you had never read the Anne Rice novels this movie doesn't stand up on it's own. It makes little sense. And the 'hero' kills innocent girls at random because according to the director's commentary good and evil are too abstract to feed on evil doers as he did in the novels. What's so abstract about killing murderers who feel no remorse? Good and evil were major themes in the book but anyway... Aside from the book this 'hero' had to be told twice that Akasha had killed her old king from two completely different characters. And each time he was surprised. Talk about a short attention span. This movie was designed to appeal to people with a very low IQ and little respect for the original source material, be it Interview with the vampire the movie or the novels. And as a stand alone film I don't think I'd even tolerate it on Mystery science theatre.I did like the songs Forsaken and Not meant for me so I'll give it credit for that but ONLY that. Fortunately for us people who actually have a mind of our own and care about character personalities we have the Sir Elton John's The Vampire Lestat Broadway musical to look forward to.

I'd heard it was bad, but had no idea how much worse than the rumors it actually was.Bad acting, bad music, bad cinematography. Laughable special effects. Incomprehensible plot. The list goes on. It was as if the director decided to pander to the MTV generation's Goth base, but instead, insulted their intelligence and aesthetics at the same time. That's a good trick, right there. The movie is like a 103 minute music video for a Godsmack-inspired Monkees.If you are a fan of Anne Rice's books, you will hate this movie for the massive changes to the story arc. If you have not read the books, you will not understand the story. My recommendation? Don't even bother with it.

Lestat is now played by Stuart Townsend instead of Tom Cruise and our vampire anti-hero decides to become a rock star . Doesn`t that premise sound slightly silly ? It does to me and it`s not helped by the way the characters in the story react to the idea that a rising rock star is indeed a vampire . If Marilyn Manson claimed to be a blood sucking vampire would he become an even bigger media sensation ? I don`t think so either . Having said that if Michael Jackson claimed the same thing that would explain a lot , like for example why he looks so pale and avoids sunlight . Oooppps better not go there guys As I said I`ve never read Anne Rice so I`ve no idea how it`s been adapted to screen but as you may expect from a tale about a rock star vampire there`s a bit too much MTV imagery involved . Stuart Townsend plays Lestat very well ( Though I doubt if he`d been successful as Aragorn - He`s a bit too young ) with the right amount of sexiness and camp . Unfortunately the rest of the cast are a bit too poe faced to make much of an impression especially former DOCTOR WHO Paul McGann . There`s another problem with the cast and that`s the minor  British  characters . As I was watching the movie I couldn`t help noticing that they didn`t have British accents , they had  Strine  accents , strine being the variant English accent that Australians speak . It wasn`t until I came to this page to write this review that I discovered that QUEEN OF THE DAMNED is an American /Australian co-production and that most of the minor Brit characters are indeed played by AussiesAt the end of the day QUEEN OF THE DAMNED may appeal to horror / Lestat fans and MTV addicts but I found it a silly film that takes itself far too seriously at the same time      "}]
