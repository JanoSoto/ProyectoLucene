It really scared me, I remember having nightmares of Mombie for weeks... I also remember rewatching it week after week. Now 10 years later I've rediscovered it and it's still chilling. Not because it was meant to be a horror, but because the imagery and plot is so vivid and captivating I can't help but feel like I'm really drawn into another world. Very few movies have done that for me... this is right up there with movies like Willow, Labrynth, and The Neverending Story. If you like musicals, bright colors and munchkin's dancing around, then stay away from this one, but if you want to go on a journey of pure imagination that will leave you breathless on the edge of your seat, rediscover Oz for yourself!

In the early 80s Disney certainly were off the cash trail with a range of films, each expertly produced, that were box office disasters. One may recall SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES, TRON, THE BLACK CAULDRON, ONE MAGIC Christmas and a few others that had much to offer any thinking crowd,and each had special effects that were quite astonishing. Disney were in a very bleak period and the films, attempting to reflect perhaps a more mature or even grown up perspective chose, oh dear I have to say it a dark and disturbing theme. At the time of release every critic bleated at the grim and melancholy tone of RETURN TO OZ, and sadly themselves neglected to celebrate the original book look, a choice Disney execs applauded themselves for. One Exec infamously said to us theatre owners We're going for the Frank L Baum book illustrations and nothing like that 1939 vaudeville thing. Oh dear, I thought at the time. You mean the world's most popular kids film? Well. $27 million dollars later in production costs returned maybe a quarter in theatre film rentals and RETURN TO OZ for all its merit and lavish production care and superb scary special effects....was consigned to the Disney dud bin. At the time I was irritated by the fixed goony expressions on Jack Pumpkinhead and the Scarecrow (loved Tik-tok, though, a fascinating and completely compelling design and movement piece) This time around I didn't mind it and actually appreciated the fact that they were 'book' expressions. Viewed 20 years later on a Disney DVD of dubious quality, I have to say it is a film more suited to these dark and disturbing times and if released today would certainly get a better reception and better crits...and possibly make a lot of money. I think the world is tuned into this type of family film more now than in the Flashdance 80s. The production values of RETURN TO OZ are simply breathtaking. Scene after scene perfectly realised the green walled horror of the psychiatric asylum in reel one, the amazing claymation of the Gnome King, and especially the glittering halls of Mombi's castle. One genuinely screamworthy scene in the hall of Heads with a headless Queen rushing about in a nightmarish vision is almost only for adults, so intense is it's genuine horror. The glittering climax of a restored Emerald City is a triumph of green and silver/gold set design, I defy any viewer not to rewind it several times just to see each and every part. Yes nominated for 5 Oscars, it won none and vanished for 20 years. The no-marquee name Fairuza Balk didn't help the public embrace, no matter how exquisite she is. At least she wasn't named Soleil Moon Fry. In the same class as The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth, RETURN TO OZ now deserves its place there as part of a trilogy of superbly crafted fantasy for smart kids and astonished adults. That 'vaudeville thing' it certainly isn't. But not a failure either. The DVD is lacking trailers and production material that should and could be included. Bad Disney! Good film! I also defy any viewer not to shriek with laughter at the Gnome King revealing he is wearing the ruby slippers, a sly joke well presented.

The movie was bright, colourful, cheerful, happy and undoubtedly saccharine. And while it was a Box-Office smash and collected millions of Oz fans worldwide, it displayed nearly none of the points that made the book series so successful. So when after viewing Return To Oz, I was extremely happy.While thousands blasted the film calling it 'dark' and even 'scary', I thoroughly enjoyed it. New characters, magic powders, creepier witches, talking chickens and flying couches - what more could an imaginative youngster want?!Faruiza Balk portayed Dorothy Gale exceptionally well, and at times, takes on Judy Garland's version so similair, it's scary! Return To Oz was, I mean, is, better than the original, because it was more based on the books, whereas The Wizard Of Oz was a cross between the original book, bittersweet sets and a symphony orchestra.While some disagree, I believe that 'Return' was not all a weak sequel, but more of a non-sequel sequel, which had little to do with the original, and had an exciting, haunting, script, which worked really well.Well it's been about 10 years since I first saw Return To Oz, and I still think that it's one of the best children's movies ever made (however scary) and it's in everyone's best interests to rent it out - even if you hated it's predacessor.

Dorothy returns to Oz and teams up with Tik-Tok (a robot), Jack Pumpkinhead (a pumpkin man obviously) and the Gump (don't ask)to battle the evil Nome King and Princess Mombi. There's plenty of fun throughout as Dorothy and friends battle the likes of the wheelies and all manner of creatures.The finale is perhaps one of the best ever for a fantasy film.

This is a different story about Dorothy and OZ that is actually more faithful to the series of L. Frank Baum books than the Judy Garland film was. Tik-Tok, Jack Pumpkinhead, Mombi, the gnome king, and the wheelers were as much a part of the original stories (published in the very early 1900's) as the scarecrow and tin man were.   I understand why some people don't like the movie as I didn't the first time I saw it. No film that trashes emerald city and has Dorothy recieving shock treatment is going to make fans of the first film very happy.However on my second veiwing years later it was nice to get an idea of the much darker vision that the author of the books had created. He created an OZ that had a very scary side to it, but ultimately good would always triumph. Although this isn't a film for kids under 8 years of age, I believe most kids would probably like it. I do think the special effects could have been a little better, as this was made in 1985. And I wish that they would have had Dorothy interact more with the scarecrow, lion and tin man.If you only want to see more of the first film then I wouldn't recommend this, otherwise enjoy.

This can't be emphasized enough.  It is actually a synthesis of the first five or so sequels to the BOOK.  (This isn't a dig at the movie, mind you.  If you don't like it on some level or other, you can't be human.  It's just that the movie was based on the book in the respect that the characters in the movie had the same names as the characters in the book.)Secondly, L. Frank Baum's original, printed-page OZ is, quite possibly, the most messed up imaginary universe ever created.  There's a land of beings who throw their own heads at you as weapons.  There's a land of sentient vegetables who raise *people* in their gardens (think Motel Hell and you've got the idea).  To top it all off, it turns out that Dorothy's buddies are really good at killing things; in particular the dear, heartless Tin Man who bloodies up his hatchet with unsettling apathy.What I'm trying to get at here is that Return to OZ is an OZ movie that is much more faithful to the books.  Much more THIS is how long you have to be alive! than We represent the Lullaby League.  I think it goes without saying that you'd be legally insane to show it to little kids, but fantasy fans, OZ enthusiasts, and fans of cult movies should hunt it down as soon as possible.By the way, please note that the old-school herky-jerky puppets and claymation monsters in this movie are scary as all get out.  Compare this to the awful remake of the Haunting with it's stupid cartoonish CGI creatures (and this isn't a dig at computer animation, but since the technique is inheritely realist, it's not scary).  There is a lesson here.

In the story, however, only six months have passed since Dorothy was brought to Oz by a tornado. During some medical tests, performed because she keeps talking about her unbelievable journey, a mysterious girl helps Dorothy escape from the hospital and back to Oz for a new adventure! The screenplay, based on two L. Frank Baum novels at once, introduces a large amount of imaginative new characters that are either Dorothy's loyal friends&#133;or malicious new enemies. It soon becomes clear that she was called back to Oz for a reason, as the evil Nome King has turned everyone to stone and the mad Princess Mombi is after more human heads for her collection. Despite the presence of a talking chicken, this is a frighteningly grim and obscure fantasy tale, perhaps not even suitable for the typical Disney-target groups. The events and characters in Return to Oz are often quite macabre (decapitation for a hobby, eerie guys on wheels&#133;) and the tone of the film is heavier since there isn't any singing and dancing going on. Perhaps a little too scary for the smallest children but Return to Oz nonetheless is a compelling and spontaneous adventure, highly recommended to those who like their fairy-tales sinister. The special effects are really terrific, with stunning stop-motion animations and some very engaging mechanical machinery (Tic-Tok!). The young Fairuza Balk is an unbelievably convincing follow-up to Judy Garland! The talented Piper Laurie (Carrie) is regretfully underused, though. This film, along with The Dark Crystal and The Neverending Story, was a huge favorite of mine when I was young and they seemly only got better with years. Good stuff.

I absolutely adored this movie, but it scared the heck out of me. I was shopping and found Return to Oz on DVD and without hesitation bought it, it's always nice to go down nostalgia lane and I was thinking maybe since I was a kid I was just easily scared by silly things, nope, I was so wrong. This is a major mind screw of a movie. However, I cannot believe that I still adore this movie, I love the risks it took and that it didn't insult children's intelligence like most movies do. Don Bluth, one of the greatest animators and story tellers of our time, said that kids are more resilient than you would think. That's so true and Return to Oz is a wonderful magical movie that leaves you breathless.Dorothy Gale has become a melancholic child who cannot stop dreaming of the people she met in the magical world of Oz, concerning Aunt Em and Uncle Henry. The two decide to take her to see Doctor Worley, known for his shock therapy treatments. Before going, Dorothy finds a key she believes her friends from Oz sent to her on a shooting star. Aunt Em leaves Dorothy at Dr. Worley's laboratory under the care of Nurse Wilson. As she is taken to have treatment, the lab has a blackout, and Dorothy is saved by a mysterious girl who reveals that some patients have been driven insane by Worley's treatment. The two escape but fall into a river. The blonde girl vanishes underwater and Dorothy returns to Oz. Upon awakening, Dorothy finds her chicken who can now talk named Billina for company. The two discover the ruined Yellow Brick Road, which leads them to the Emerald City, now in ruins, missing its emeralds, and all of its citizens including the Tin Woodman and Cowardly Lion turned to stone. She swears that she will restore Oz with the help of some new friends while being chased by some disturbing new villains.I remember as a kid being terrified by Princess Mumbi, she has this room full of heads that she can change as she pleases and when Dorothy has to go to retrieve a potion from her cabinet with the main head she accidentally knocks over a jar and the head screams Dorothy Gail!!! and all the other heads start screaming! God, that scene is still horrifying to watch! But there is an extremely touching scene that always gets me in tears, Jack Pumpkinhead who Dorothy meets asks her if he could call her mom until he finds his real mother, she agrees with a kind heart and as they are laying on their flying couch called The Gump, he puts a scarf on her and says good night, mom. I loved their relationship, it was beautiful. Also she has a great relationship with Tik Tok, a robot who was part of the Army of Oz and has to be wound up in order to work, his personality fits so extremely well with the group since you have the silliness, you need the intelligence too. The effects are still outstanding to this day in my opinion, the acting is very good, the sets, the lighting, the costumes, the characters, I just love Return to Oz. It's a great movie. Parents today are so afraid of showing their children movies like Return to Oz because it might give them nightmares, take advice from me and Mr. Bluth, your kids are a lot stronger than you think, and I'm perfectly fine and I'm so glad I have this movie in my collection.

Her Auntie and Uncle do not know what do to with her, and no-one believes her amazing stories. Eventually she is sent to a psychiatric hospital, and unknown to her family it is run by near-masochists who supposedly perform terrifying experiments on children. As this is above all a kids' movie, none of this is shown, but the suggestion is pretty heavy, and there are 'implements' all over the hospital. Jean Marsh plays Nurse Wilson who is relentlessly horrifying, and pursues Dorothy through the stormy night in which Dorothy escapes. Dorothy jumps into a river, and when she wakes she is in Oz with a chicken called Billina. However, after some exploring it appears that Oz has been infected with some kind of evil, and it is no longer the enchanting place it was, but is now the place of nightmares. The Emerald city and all inhabitants including the Cowardly Lion and the Tin-Man have been turned to stone. After a chase by the brilliantly memorable and scary Wheelers, Dorothy meets Tik-Tok, a mechanical man, and they try to find the Scarecrow and work out what has happened. Soon Dorothy is taken prisoner by the wicked Princess Mombi, Jean Marsh again, who is obsessed with her appearance, stealing the heads of beautiful young women. It seems that the Nome King has become immensely powerful, turning all to stone as his personal statues. The struggle to return Oz to its glory is one which will take all of Dorothy's skill and love.This film is a definite classic for kids, but beware, it is dark and has many moments which will be scary. I saw this recently, having not seen it in a few years, and although the impact has dwindled, and the faults are clear, it is still a good film although should definitely be seen at a young age. There are many things to recommend it, although fans of The Wizard of Oz my be disappointed by the lack of music and light-hearted fun. The acting is all top notch;Jean Marsh is excellent in her roles, an extremely talented actress, and Fairuza Balk is outstanding in her first role, seeming both timid and strong and giving a good account of what may be a disturbed child. The new characters are all just as good as those in the 1939 film, particularly Pumpkinhead and Tik-Tok. The effects here are also extremely good for their time, and they are still pretty good to see today. Scary moments include the Wheeler chase, the final encounter with the Nome King, and of course the infamous screaming heads scene which will likely stay in the memory of all who see it. If you have children with strong imaginations, or with an interest in reading or fantasy, then this is a film they should be shown, but if they are scared easily it may not be such a good idea.7.5 "},{"Title":"Awesome and astonishing fantasy film","Date":"18 February 2002","Score":"6 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Family, Fantasy","Review":"  Along with Hook (1991) this has got to be the best continuation / sequelesque adaptation of a classic fairy tale for kids . (although this one is slightly better than Hook because it has a more reliable plot and a tighter pace) . There are no words to describe how well constructed this movie is . Every part of it really shines . From the imaginative direction to the impressive sets and costumes and from the professionally constructed script and dialogue to the effectively subtle performances from all the actors (live and animatronic) .I will have to tell you that I am fanatically against the screenplay changes film-makers usually conduct to a story / novel / myth / comic book / TV show when they turn it into a movie . They omit important plot elements , they mistreat important characters by underusing them , they often fail to shoot chilling scenes from the book (et al) due to lame direction and untalented SFX crew members hence not doing them justice (like the freezing super power of Sub-Zero in Mortal Kombat) and generally they bastardize crucial thematic parts because of many changes in the atmosphere of the original . The Return to Oz script mixes elements from 2 books by L. Frank Baum and puts them in the blender with multiple variations and vital declinations from their roots . God forgive me but it is probably the best bastardization I have ever witnessed . If these words are coming out of my mouth then it is definitely a very successful film . I will brief you a little (slight spoilers coming)   characters from the first book which is the direct continuation of Dorothy 's adventures where Dorothy manages to find the ruby slippers and returns to see her friends , are Jack the pumpkinhead , the reindeer-headed flying sofa and Mombie the witch (and NOT an aristocratic princess) . Jack and the reindeer were precisely the same as in the movie , animated by the powder of life . (there was also a cute wooden pony which was probably omitted because it was a silent role) . Mombie however was a rather old grey haired  wannabe witch who resembled remarkably Mim ! ( for the uninitiated Mim is Magica De Spell 's partner in the crusade of stealing the lucky dime of uncle Scrooge) . Ozma was indeed Mombie 's prisoner although she thought she was a boy in a young Jodie Foster way with dirty clothes under the name Chip ! The second book introduces us to Tic Toc who managed to drag Dorothy into the land of Oz once again . Tic Toc was indeed a golden metal robot but a bit shorter and quite thinner so he wasn 't as macho as in the film . He had more childish voice and manners , something like a juvenile version of C3PO from Star Wars . The greatest change was of course the Gnome King . Although his kingdom was under the ground of a desert he was not the ruler of stones but the king of Dwarfs (he was a nasty little Oumba Looba-like himself) . Nevertheless he had a powerful army and weapons and he tried to take over Oz. The Dwarves ' only weakness was the eggs . Oh , and Bileena was not Dorothy 's chicken but a native habitant chicken in Oz . The rescue mission was not for the Schiactro but for an unrelated prince (the Prince of Eb under the request of his beloved Princess) . Also the jewelry museum was true with the difference that the contestants had only one chance (not 3). The rest of the plot 's surprises such as the wheelers & the decapitated dancers were completely the brainchildren of Walter Murch and Gill Dennis.All in all the combination of these thematic factors was wonderful . I believe that this slightly tense adaptation is a much more successful depiction of Frank Baum 's vision of the Land of Oz . Enchanting and beautiful for the eye but with hidden dangers lurking around . Who can forget the beginning sequence where Dorothy finds Oz literally wrecked ? Everybody has been transformed into a stone statue and the roads and buildings are torn apart . The direction is flawless in giving us this absolutely successful threatening but interestingly suspenseful scene . I really cannot realize why so many libels like much dark too scary etc. This has exactly the same level of violence with classic Disney cartoons where the evil step mother curses Snow White with diabolical spells in the middle of storm with frightening thunders or where Sleeping Beauty 's charming prince struggles to save her by fighting her wicked witch godmother who is transformed into a giant dragon who spits up disastrous and dreadful fireballs . A much more twisted and snicky kids film is  Willy Wonka  , especially the boat scene .Anyway I don 't think Mombie 's heads or the giggling deranged wheelers can be frightening . They are graphic figures like the wicked witch of the West or the gremlins . As a matter of fact how hasn 't anyone found unsuitable and politically uncorrect the reoccurring quote of the Queen of hearts  Off with his / her / their head !   in Alice in Wonderland (which keep in mind that was written by a priest) . Not only Return to Oz is the near perfect follow-up to a well known legend , but it is also one of the best fairy tale adaptations  cinema industry has ever given us . Adequate SFX (like the petrified Emerald city or the flying sofa or the earthquake scene) , impressive sets (Mombie 's palace or the desert) and of course the unforgettable jewels museum (I have seen the film several times but this scene always thrills me) . As a stand alone fairy tale it is also great . Two scenes at the end standout as perfect examples *******Spoiler alert******** The celebration scene at the palace and the mirror-through communication between Dorothy and Ozma******** On top of that the glossy ruby slippers are still enchanting . What else can be said ? Mere cameos from the Tin man and the coward lion for the fans of the old cast combine with fine direction and script for a spectacular show .

The imagery of this film lingers long after first view, and its marked stylistic and thematic differences to Wizard Of Oz have a hypnotic effect on a certain type of viewer.In Return, the central theme is one of deep unhappiness with reality and a wish to return to fantasy, where as Wizard focuses more on the concept of there's no place like home. I admire and am still deeply effected by this film because, in some ways, it is braver than Wizard. It isn't afraid to deal with the conflict - that the misery of a grey Kansas is very real.It expresses a rippling dissatisfaction that seems more in keeping with Baum's original works, and is all the more satisfying for it. In particular, I enjoyed the parrallels between the real world and Oz- for what it suggests about our world- and the Nome King's conversation with Dorothy. For a children's film, there is great depth in both, and most of the film can be interpreted on several different levels. The implications of the corridor of heads alone is enough to send any first year pysch/lit student into a whole mess of garbage.But don't be fooled.

SPOILERS!","Date":"25 July 2003","Score":"5 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Family, Fantasy","Review":"  I fully recommend this film. My father bought it in a second hand video shop for £1! That was when I was 9. I am now 18, and it still plays on my television. Having been brought up on the original movie, as a child, I never really made the link between the two. I think Disney introduced this movie not just as a sequel, but an original story in its own right. You don't need to see the first, to see the second. As I child, I used to get spine tingling nightmares when watching this movie. Even though it frightened me, it also excited me. It should not have been certified a PG, more like a 12, but having said that, I'm glad I watched when I was young.You cannot compare it to the likes of Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter because these films were made in a new era. The powerful combination of the music, visual effects of the characters and the intricate plotline gives this  film a 5* rating in a separate film poll.Although Return To Oz is not as colourful and positive as the original Julie Garland movie, it contains sinister undertones, like the psychiatric hospital and the doctor attempting to give Dorothy electric shock treatment, to destroy her dreams of the magical world of Oz.The original film was timeless, as there was no indication of the decade or even century the film was set. In comparison, the opening scenes of Return to Oz reminds the viewer that this film was set at the turn of the century (1899), at the dawn of a new era, as the doctor points out to both the viewer and Dorothy Gale. This realistic theme of the film is touched upon, but not elaborated. It seems all sense of time and place is lost when Dorothy enters Oz.From an adults perspective, Dorothy's adventures in Oz are merely a dream. To a child, they are very much a real life happening. We would all like to believe we could escape to a secret, colourful, bright, timeless place like Oz, but as we get older, that secret place seems even more farther to reach.I think Walter Murch was very clever with the linkages made between the first and the second film. He has managed to make his own mark on the film as an original piece of movie-making. However, we know it is a sequel from the title. Other reminders include Dorothy's connection made between the people that enter her life in Kansas, and the characters that she encounters in Oz. For example, the male nurse who 'wheels' her to the operating table does not speak a word. All Dorothy can hear is the squeaking of the wheels of her moving bed. In Oz, the face of the male nurse is repeated over a dozen times, and reintroduced as the fast-moving, squeaky mobile creatures known as the wheelers. The creature is shown as an evil one, working for Mombie. This shows Dorothy was frightened of the male nurse in Kansas. Her dreams takeover, and recreate this man as an evil, impatient, large character.Mombie (another villain who challenges Dorothy) was also Nurse Wilson who kept a close eye on Dorothy, in the hospital. When Dorothy attempted to escape, along with Ozma, Wilson finds the girls and shrieks you! This is where the dreamworld and our world of reality overlaps, as we discover Wilson already recognises Ozma (unnamed until we enter Oz). We are also reminded, towards the end of the film, that Mombie was not only imprisoned for the use of her evil powers in Oz, but also in the real world.During Dorothy's adventures in Oz, Aunt Emily explains the hospital was destroyed in a fire. Dr. Worley (who appears as the Nome King in Oz) was burned to death, he tried to save his machines. Ironically, the Nome King was also destroyed, with the help of Billina's poisonous egg. As Aunt Em talks about it, she hugs Dorothy, holding her in a blanket, but Dorothy's eyes tell all. It's like she already knows. She is not shocked by the burning of the hospital, nor is she shocked to see a coach man driving Nurse Wilson away, within a coach made like a prison cell.Not once in the film does Fairuza Balk falter in her performance. Although she is a child, Dorothy is required to make responsible, mature adult decisions, in her quest to save the land of Oz. Even Pumpkinhead calls her Mum. She feels a responsibility to look after all her friends, as she is the decision-maker, the oracle. Tik-Tok is also a good decision-maker, but his thinking falters when it runs down.Dorothy's eyes are not unlike an adults; large, tired, aged and all-knowing.All in all, I rate this film 10 out of 10. The cabinets which display Mombie's different heads still haunts me to this day. As does the vision of Mombie sleeping in her bed, headless, but still breathing. I can remember screaming with my friends as Mombie gets up from her bed, headless, bellowing D-O-R-O-T-H-Y  G-A-L-E?.....Where's my powder of life?

Far scarier than the original movie in 1939, the new characters in Oz like Tik-Tok, Jack Pumkinhead, Mombi(Jean Marsh), and the Wheelers. They didn't show the Munchkins, and Dorothy's original friends The Tin Woodsman, and The Cowardly Lion have turned to stone. And to me, The Wheelers replaced the Flying Monkeys which makes this movie a classic of its own. The funny parts in the movie is when Tik-Tok took out the Wheelers, and Jack Pumkinhead's head lands upside down, and he asks, Why are you standing on your heads? And that character Mombi, she has more heads than Albert Eistein. That's what makes her a dangerous character. I enjoyed every bit of this movie, it was different, original, and definitely not a sequel to the first. Otherwise, it would be a no-brainer. Hard to rent, easy to buy, it's a neo-classic for all ages. Rating 4 out of 5 stars.

There is simply no way you could follow the Wizard of Oz successfully.  If you made another musical with happy characters and silly munchkins, it would be criticized as just a rehash of the original.  So director Walter Murch went down a different path with this one.  A VERY different path.  But one that is true to the Oz books, unlike The Wizard of Oz.  Return to Oz is a dark film that chronicles Dorothy's journey back to the land of Oz.  The film may come off frightening to children.  I was scared the first time I saw it.  But the film also contains beautiful scenery, remarkable special effects, and memorable characters.  The symbolism from real world to fantasy world is well done; there are at least 3 actors who play dual roles.The villains in Return to Oz are especially memorable; it makes sense that in The Wizard of Oz we have popular heroes (Lion, Tin Man, Scarecrow) in a joyful film, while in Return to Oz we have memorable villains the savage, insane Wheelers, evil Princess Mombie and the powerful Nome King in a dark film.  One of the chief reasons why Return to Oz is not a popular movie is that our heroes, excluding Dorothy, are all creatures we cannot identify with.  In The Wizard of Oz the lion, tin man, and scarecrow were each searching for something (courage, heart, and a brain, respectively).  As people we could identify with these things.  And it helps that in The Wizard of Oz we have a good portion of the movie devoted solely to development of these characters (the journey through the forest).  In Return to Oz Dorothy's faithful friends are Tic-Toc, who is a mechanical creation that needs to be wound up to work.  This may sounds similar to the tin man but while the tin man was a human turned to tin, Tic-Toc is a complete robot.  Tic-Toc does not have feelings or emotions, so we can't care a whole lot if he is destroyed because after all he is just a pile of nuts and bolts.  Still, Dorothy meets Tic-Toc before the others in Oz, so we probably care about him more than the others except perhaps Billina.  Billina is a chicken.  She basically takes the place of Toto as the farm animal Dorothy takes with her to Oz.  But it's hard to feel for a chicken.  Must harder than, say, a DOG.   Jack Pumpkinhead comes into the story when Dorothy ventures into Mombie's palace.  He is tall, thin creation with a pumpkin for a head that speaks with a high, quivering voice.  By the end of the movie you will be glad to be rid of his voice.  He is very kind to Dorothy and a loyal friend, but because he is so silly-looking and sounding, he comes off as something similar to Jar-Jar Binks from the recent Star Wars Episode I.  A memorable friend who is not QUITE as annoying as Jar-Jar, but no Scarecrow or Cowardly Lion from Wizard of Oz.  Dorothy's other friend is a contraption out of ferns, a sofa, and a moose head named Gump who is also a good friend but a monstrosity to look at.  Back to the villains for a second The wheelers are scary as hell.  Interesting how their real-world counterpart, the drones at the mental hospital who push gurneys, are emotionless and mute, while the wheelers laugh at everything and are complete free spirits.  But listen to their wheels squeak and you will find it is the same (or very similar) as the hospital workers pushing the gurneys.  Princess Mombie also makes a great villain.  Did you catch Aunt Em introducing Dorothy to her hospital counterpart?  The HEAD nurse  The all-powerful Nome King is great in the last sequence; pay attention for many connections between him and Dr. Worley.  Fairuza Balk as Dororthy gives a performance better than Judy Garland's in the first Oz, and unfortunately for her, 16 years later she has yet to give a performances on par with this one.  Dorothy invokes alot of emotion from us; she is resourceful, intelligent, polite, kind, and we the audience really believe her when she expresses strong emotions.  One such instance is when she sees the yellow-brick road torn up, or when she first notices the Emerald City in ruins.  There is genuine hurt in her voice as she soaks in the destruction of these once-landmarks of Oz.  The claymation effects are fantastic; to this day it is still impressive to watch eyes appear out of the rocks.  And the Nome King's lair and the Nome King himself looks quite amazing.  Return to Oz is a vastly underrated classic.  It will likely never get widespread acclaim.  And since it is following one of the most beloved movies of all time, it will continued to get blasted.  But watch the film and decide for yourself.  Just don't expect The Wizard of Oz all over.  Expect a fantastical magical journey into a dark and dangerous world filled with beautiful images, haunting villains, and memorable characters.  And don't forget to check out the symbolism between real world and Oz.

The book itself scared me, I definitely found it darker than the Oz I knew. This movie might have scared me more had I seen it then. I finally saw it on the Internet just now, and found it underwhelming. This can serve as a sequel to the 1939 film but it's really a separate adaptation of a public domain story.The story gets darker starting with the opening in Kansas, where we have scary science and Dorothy needing to break free. When she gets to Oz (how, I'm not sure) she finds the place in ruins, which may not be pleasant to those who remember the pretty place we saw in the 1939 classic, but it is interesting. The creepiest part may be a woman who keeps many heads, and threatens to take Dorothy's head.Still, any gripping atmosphere this movie could have had is sunk by poor special effects. This may be surprising since it came 45 years after Judy Garland's movie and the Great Depression was long gone this time, but the older movie looks better than this one. The most obvious comparison would be the Scarecrow, who looks terribly cheap here. It goes deeper than that, however. The talking rocks and Wheelers are poor effects as well. For this reason, Return to Oz won't draw you into Oz in the same way The Wizard of Oz does.

It is good to know one is not alone. What I would like to add is to pick up on one commenter (at least) who mentioned the uncanny and unsettling ability of the film to portray childhood honestly, terribly, heartbreakingly. I disagree with those who say the ending of the film is too sentimental. ***** spoiler alert ***** When Dorothy brings Ozma's image up on her mirror in her room - and she does so by tracing 'Oz' on the glass, on top of her own reflection, no less - Dorothy's adventures are made real to her, to us. Now we know what she knows and this is no dream. There is the heartbreak of childhood, reflected in those two girls' faces. There sits Ozma with Billina facing Dorothy with Toto. Ozma tells Dorothy, silently, stunningly, to not say a word and Dorothy nods. We are complicit with her. When the camera pulls back and back, leaving her with her reality and the viewers with ours, I weep every time. And that astounding score certainly underlines the point, in case one hasn't been paying attention. The video version terrified my six year old son and still does (even just the music) one year later. He watched it without my permission (under the supervision of an unknowing adult). So I agree it is not for little children. This same son loves the Oz books though, all 30+++ of them and can't wait for me to track down another one. We will watch it together someday. ***** spoiler alert ***** When Dorothy hugs the frozen, stony statue that is supposed to be the Cowardly Lion, how can one not ache with her? The voice, construction and overall portrayal of Jack Pumpkinhead - and Dorothy's acceptance of him - is precious, precious stuff. The discovery of Ozma and her reception of Dorothy are scenes that are visually electrifying and go way beyond the pap that is usually presented as children's fare. Again, look at Ozma's face when she wishes Dorothy back as Dorothy looks at her. If you have seen it and hated it, see it again and allow yourself to look through the look of things (George MacDonald). Return to Oz is a classic, no doubt about it. It dared to be different from its iconic pre-quel. It is an exciting, spellbinding, heartbreakingly stunning dare.

Return to Oz is a little like the movie DUNE in that is kind of a big budget flop with an immortal afterlife (and both are 80's fantasy movies). I will eventually admit that the MGM Wizard of Oz is better, for a number of reasons, but I would choose to watch Return to Oz rather than the former, any day of the week. It has a similar feel to some of the other fantasy pics from that general time period (Labyrinth, Never Ending Story etc.), but it holds up much better than the others and does not seem dated or cheesy.After watching it recently I was looking into the history and back-story of the production and the theatrical release. Wikipedia says that it was released shortly after Micheal Eisner became Disney's CEO and that he dumped it to make himself look good and the old guard who made it look bad. Many people think the many bad reviews it received were planted as part of this strategy.That being said, the movie still lacks the cohesive story of the MGM Wizard of Oz, possibly because the script combines two of Baum's books. It is a little awkward having two enemies (princess Mombi and the Nome king). It kind of feels like something is missing from the story. Oh yeah, and it is a really morbid movie. However, none of these things ruin it, and maybe they indirectly make it better. Its a weird movie with a unique atmosphere.My friend and I spent the whole movie trying to figure out how they made Tik Tok walk. Apparently he was a puppet because the IMDb lists a goof in the movie where you can see a puppeteer controlling him. We had not noticed that and the best guess we came up with was that someone was curled up inside, using their arms to walk, because the legs are too far apart for a human's legs to be inside.I guess I wrote this for my own amusement because there are already 144 reviews.

I don't even care as much about the stupid mistakes like making Mombi and Princess Langwidere one person. They were both villains and I don't love that, but okay I accept it. I thought that the Judy Garland version butchered the OZ series as much as humanly possible until this movie came along. At least they got the mood of OZ correct. The plot is that Dorothy's aunt and uncle put her in an institution and she escapes with the help of a mysterious blonde girl. Uncle Henry and Auntie Em would never do that. Even in th Emerald City of OZ, when they are going broke and extremely worried that their niece is going insane, they try to shield her from all the hardship in their lives and tell her to go in the attic and dream and say that she should go to OZ while there is so much trouble. It is nuts to think that they would put her through that. They also messed up my favorite character of all time. Princess Langwidere is vain and silly, but not a malicious, evil character like the one portrayed. At one point, she wants to swap heads with Dorothy, but it is only because she forgot and is wearing her head that is impulsive and has a bad temper. Mombi was a evil, but she wasn't nearly as bad as the woman portrayed. She also had absolutely no connection to the Nome King. He was also silly. He was a villain, but in the books, he is a fat, rolly-polly, little man with a huge belt that turned the entire Royal Family of Ev into ornaments. Not exactly the evilest man in the world. Also, one of the best parts of the series was the second book, where you find out that Mombi turned Ozma into a boy and hid her that way. The mirror thing was just so silly and they took away one of the best twists ever. These books were written during the Depression as a form of escapism. It wasn't dark; it was happy.

For one, sadly, it didn't do well at the box office, so presumably a lot of children didn't see it who might have. But for those that reviewed it, the consensus was it was too dark for kids. Hogwash. Kids can actually take much more dramatic and terrifying things than we think - maybe some may be more sensitive than others, but so are adults - and a response to feats of imagination are always eye-catching to them. If it was about the story and characters, that's another matter.On an artistic, sensory-visual level Return to Oz is mostly spectacular work, with a plethora of eye-catching and inspired practical effects (one of which I have to imagine the character of Jack Skellington was the inspiration for), matte paintings, marionettes and puppets, claymation, the works, with an Emerald city that looks like a Russian communist block from that time period (and I mean that in a complimentary way - it's exquisitely run-down) . And I liked how dark and weird it got, that was fine.If I didn't care for something it was most of the supporting characters who become Dorothy's companions. They didn't have the strong-memorable personalities or sense of enchantment (or even just good acting) of the three that accompanied Dorothy in 'Wizard' - or, hell, even the companions in Oz The Great and Powerful, which I'd argue is maybe a more inspired film than this, albeit with CGI. And the villain - aho is appropriately bad-*ss and deranged, is only most effective by the third act, with a one-dimensional shrieking witch (albeit with wonderful multiple heads to choose from) in the rest of the film.So, Return to Oz is a really good movie. If it's a lost classic? Depends who you ask, I suppose.

Perhaps the main difference is the tone of the film. The 1939 epic was all blatantly filmed in a studio. It could have been a stage show, simply converted to film for all we knew, whereas the sequel is all filmed on location, automatically giving it a more realistic feel.It also drew criticism for NOT having any of the other cast members back. Yes, the Scarecrow, Cowardly Lion and Tin Man are all in it (technically), but their screen time amounts to little more than extended cameos. Instead, we're treated to a new set of weird and wonderful helpers, who go about aiding Dorothy in her quest to defeat a new baddie (the Gnome King).Apart from the fact that it's Oz and the central character is Dorothy, there are few similarities between the two films, leaving some to wonder what sort of sequel this is.But don't be put off. It may be a different type of magical adventure, but it's still a very good one. Fairuza Balk has the difficult task of being the new Judy Garland, but she puts on a good performance as the small, vulnerable girl, lost in a much more nasty place than (the slightly older) Judy Garland had to survive in.If you're a fan of fantasy films (and of course the original) then you should enjoy this. Just don't expect the happy-go-lucky feel of Oz's predecessor. It's worth returning to Oz, just to see this.

The well designed sets and imaginative characters and the feel that is much closer to L. Frank Baum's works (even though I did not read them) made it more enjoyable than the original. The character that freaks me out the most? The Nome King and his Nomes. The idea of some demonic face peering at me from a wall or rock just gives me the feel of paranoia.

After a re-watch I must say that I wish Walter Murch would have directed more films in the 80's / early 90's because Return to Oz was an amazing debut. This movie really captured my imagination as a child and it holds up today. Audiences wrote the movie off because it wasn't a direct sequel to the 1939 Wizard of Oz musical and more of an adaptation of several of L. Frank Baum's novels. I remember getting over this fact pretty quickly as a kid and even more so now when major characters from Batman to Spiderman are re-cast every year. The real joy is just how dark and gruesome this is for a kid's movie. The truly twisted head swapping of Princess Mombi and the nightmarish post-apocalyptic Mad Max looking Wheelies juxtaposed with a friendly Pumpkin Head and talking Hen. This was more effective than Are You Afraid of the Dark or Goosebumps for me. This is how a children's horror movie should be made without insulting the intelligence of adults.10/10.

Fast forward to 1985. The decade of the 80s brought new technology for film, more specifically the early stages of CGI and anamotronics. Beyond that, the fantasy films of the 80s still lacked continuity with the many layers that often made the final cut look cheap, (despite that it was considered the best advances of the time). A piece like Return to Oz falls under the category of 'sci-fi and fantasy' and seemed to get lost in the shuffle of the many film pieces coming out at the time. I didn't pick up on this movie until Oz the Great And Powerful showed a documentary on The Wizard of Oz and it's involvement with Disney over the years. This is actually one of the few movies that actually got the layering effect right! I was very impressed with the clay-mation shots and the cutting away back and forth between the foreground and background parts of the stage. There aren't many notable actors who took the stage for the movie, however I did recognize western actor Matt Clark, who I remember from BTTF Part III as the bartender. Another notable piece of trivia concerning BTTF is that Christopher Lloyd and Mary Steenbergen almost got the roles of Mombie and the Knome king. This is an 80s gem, that for the kids who remember the movie can pass it down to their children as part of The Wizard of Oz folklore.

It has great acting, a good story and the most important aspect for a family film, it appeals to kids and adults while never talking down to either group ONCE. Kids see this movie and are swept away into the magic of Oz, adults get a taste of what its like to be a kid again for a couple of hours.So what is the plot to this film? Dorothy is sent to an electric healer by Aunt Em and Uncle Henry to cure her dellusions of Oz. She escapes during a storm and gets swept into the magical world of Oz. Although if you're expecting munchkins and the overall delightful background of the last movie...you'll be beyond disappointed. The Yellow Brick Road is destroyed as is the Emerald City and the citizens of Oz are all turned to stone. She meets companions such as Bellina, Tik Tok, Jack Pumpkinhead and a Gump (I'm not going to try and explain that, I don't even know how).The acting is absolutely marvelous, Fairuza Balk is who I think of whenever someone says Dorothy Gale to me because she just took that part and made it hers (which, considering the original was Judy Garland, thats not easy. Especially for an 8 year old!), Nicol Williamson and Jean Marsh play threatening villains incredibly well and the voice acting fits the puppet work and claymation to a tee.The visual effects still hold up as being impressive. I find this element the one that really does pull the audience into the fantasy world that Walter Murch created. Its also Oscar nominated visual effects (why the hell didn't they win?!).Okay, this film is actually one of the darkest family films you're likely to encounter however I think it comes with the medium pretty well. Kids like being scared, otherwise, why would they go out for Halloween? In fact, I think one family film director said you can throw any emotions you want at kids, as long as you give them a happy ending and this film does have that happy ending and somehow keeps the charm of the 1939 film.Now I've glorified this film (and for me that was as easy as counting) I should name some things I didn't like about it. The film does feel short and for me, that is a problem (although if this was a 3 hour epic, I'm sure I'd still be saying that), and for one that I feel is legitimate - The Nome King's plan is revealed very abruptly. Although one major complaint is not this film's fault - I never saw this as a kid. I would have loved to have seen this back then but sadly, that time has passed and all I can do is love it as an adult...the next best thing.The major thing that really does give this film strength against the other countless crap Oz sequels is that it actually has the heart and soul of a family film. Modern family films are ooh, look at the great visual effects. and everything else in terms of story and characters are unengaging and dull, the script talks to the audience as if it needs to hold its audience's hand through everything. This film just entertains and pulls the audience into an experience through the film. A lot like the original Star Wars trilogy.Overall, yes, this review might be bias due to how much I respect and love it but despite what critics who saw this film back then said, this film is an enjoyable film if you can let it sink in that there are Oz reboots, you'll find something to enjoy about this film. I put a guarantee on that, THATS how much I love this film.PS. The obvious question after this is what did I think of the 1939 film? I think its a great film yet, it falls short in comparison with this.

It resembles nothing of the MGM classic and is almost no comparison in regards to achievement or style. Nonetheless the film has been endured as a family-friendly version of Oz and has achieved cult status. Return to Oz is the black sheep of the Oz film family in this writer's eyes.In honor of Roger Ebert, who passed earlier this week, I would give this film one thumbs up, as it sparked my interest enough to watch it, but not enough to take it seriously after seeing the 1939 classic it is a sequel of. It has a hint of Disney magic, but nothing full flair like many Disney adaptations today, such as The Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian or the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. However, Return to Oz does build on a classic and that is why it is still remembered today.I was only glad to hear that Disney Corp had decided to make Oz the Great and Powerful as a prequel to the 1939 classic.

Don't pretend that there isn't any, It may be Star Wars, it may be Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory, it may be The Lion King, Mine is Return To Oz.I first saw this when I was around 9 years old. I had already seen the Judy Garland film and I enjoyed it but Dorothy seemed a bit more human in this. I was able to relate to her and I would sometimes be on the edge of my seat while watching. My parents thought this was a bit unsuitable for me when I first saw it (maybe it was the hallway of screaming decapitated Mombi heads that got them). 3 months later (or thereabouts, I'm hazy on the details as you can imagine) I wanted to watch it again because I was so entertained by Dorothy, Tik Tok & Jack Pumpkinhead's adventure to stop the Nome King. I watched this film almost once every week until high school.For new years eve, I decided to give this a bit of a rewatch and I am amazed as to how much I still love it. The memories of childhood came rushing back. I can still find things to compliment even without taking into context the childhood memories.Fairuza Balk plays the part of Dorothy like she was improvising Shakespeare. The quality of that child actor's performance (although now she's 40...Time really DOES fly but I was only born the year this was made) is amazing. Nicol Williamson also has great screen presence as a villain and he did scare me when I was younger(although in comparison with the Mombi heads, that was nothing. I loved the movie but I also had nightmares of screaming heads).The visual effects are also outstanding, even by today's standards (and today's standards would look 1000% fake and would destroy everything I loved about it through a remake). The reason this didn't win the Oscar? I have no idea.My only complaint about this film is that kids today and in the next generation will barely see this film and instead go to crap like Wreck-It Ralph which will age horribly when this managed to entertain me over a span of around 20 years.If you want a great family movie with outstanding entertainment value (if I can like it as an innocent 9 year old and as a 27 year old gay who is generally into horror movies of all things, this is a great film), than I hold this film up highly. Every member of the family will find some entertainment in this film(except maybe kids from age 4-8 - anything past is a good age to watch this).PS. I do understand this wont be everyone's cup of tea, it was hard to write that without sounding bias, without the little kid me dropping in a few words too.

When it was announced that Disney would be making a second Oz film there was quite a buzz.What was this film going to be exactly? A direct sequel? A standalone adventure? The answer it turned out was that it would be both. A lot of money went into the film and great talent had been assembled. Then the film was released and the response was not very pretty.

Moves along at a nice pace. Takes things in a new direction without repeating the original.Cons Plot could have used more complications.

In both movies the slippers are made of ruby. This differs from Baum's books in which the slippers were silver. Also, the MGM's concept of Dorothy imagining Oz based on people she knows in the real world is mostly kept intact in Return to Oz. In the books, Baum created Oz as an unambiguous REAL world, not something out of a character's dreams or imagination.Return to Oz, besides being more realistic, much darker and not at all a musical, the movie is truer to the original Oz as described in Baum's books. Certain key elements of the books, such as the Tin Woodsman's back story are restored back, absent from the first film. Also, Fairuza Balk was nine during the filming, which is much closer to the age of Dorothy Gale in the books than that of Judy Garland, who was 16. Although one of the chief complaints from those unfamiliar with the books is that this movie has some disturbing scenes and violence, this is again truer to Baum's vision it was common for the books to contain such scenes, although they were a bit less scary. I recall in one of the books that they sentenced a witch to death by pouring water over her. I think this movie kept true to Baum's vision and was not diluted or, arguably, censored like the 1939 MGM film. It is a real tribute to the fans of the books.

The story begins approximately six months after the tornado hits; Dorothy has trouble sleeping so Aunt Em takes her to a doctor to rid her of her dreams of a place that doesn't exist. With the help of a mysterious girl, Dorothy escapes from the hospital during a thunderstorm and is swept away by the nearby raging river. She awakens on the shores of OZ with her beloved chicken, Billina, and they set off to find the Emerald City. The yellow-brick road is destroyed, the city is silent and crumbling with its residents all turned to stone. With the help of new friends, Tik-Tok, Jack, and the Gump, Dorothy outsmarts the freaky Wheelers and a frightening Princess Mombi to square off with the Nome King who daintily displays the ruby slippers on his own feet. In the end OZ returns to its former glory with new leader. This movie certainly begs the viewer to think about OZ more critically and why Dorothy uses it as a place of mental escape.After reading the I Hated It user comments of this movie it reminded me of the plethora of comments from 2005's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory vs. its 1971 predecessor. The bulk of comments for RTZ revolved around how everything looked different from 1939, how Dorothy was suddenly 10 yrs old, etc...first, DO NOT take the 1939 movie as gospel; it strayed severely from Baum's original work. This work however uses William Denslow's illustrations in the original classics to depict the Tin Man and lion, especially. How many of those I Hated It people realize Baum wrote more than ONE OZ book??? Return to Oz is NOT a sequel to MGM's 1939 movie and should NEVER be treated as such. It is another interpretation of Baum's books; new director, new studio, new actors, etc... Just like Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory should NOT be considered a remake of the 1971 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory it too is a reinterpretation of the same book.

With a different audience, in mind.But just because this didn't follow the original to a pulp, why bash it. No, it's not a kid film.  No, it's not like the original.  No, it doesn't follow the books exactly either.  And I'm glad it doesn't, because I don't think you would have got an outcome like this!If you watch this film with film with an open mind, and not hoping for a sequel to Wizard, then Return, should be a pleasant surprise!!

Strictly in terms of the movie itself, Return is an excellent movie, and I cannot see how or why it got lousy critic reviews! Maybe that's because it ignores the essence of Wizard which was more appealing to children, but Return is a more mature movie, and I think it is definitely easily more gripping and far much more entertaining than the first Oz.At any rate, keep in mind that when I was 8 years old, I was really really scared, but later on I came to realize the power of this movie. I saw it earlier last month and I enjoyed it as much as I did all those 12 years ago. Return is not just for kids, this is not a silly song-a-thon!

I'm still pondering it. The production values are first-rate, the conception and execution are absolutely stunning, and the music and cinematography are manifestations of some unspoken poetry. The drunken fanfares and weeping strings on the soundtrack, the poised, meditative composition of the shots, the way animatronics and claymation are used far more effectively in the absence of CGI than anything I've seen in the last four months, easily. It was courageous of director Walter Murch (who never worked in that capacity again, although he's since received Oscars and all sorts of other technical citations for his editing work on such films as The English Patient) to basically construct the film as a sort of tone poem to childhood, to the way a flat and unchanging Midwestern sky can crush a little girl's spirit.From what I can remember, the film was a financial disaster. The pre-Eisner-Wells Disney poured roughly $30 million into the production -- a fortune at the time. The money is all up on the screen, however. The sets are intricate and spectacular.Ultimately, this film lands somewhere between The Neverending Story and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen in my estimation. It doesn't descend into eighties camp the way the former seems to have in hindsight, but ultimately it's not quite as sophisticated or consistent as Terry Gilliam's work. You get the idea that Murch & Co. received pressure from the suits to push the film into a more kid-friendly direction (on a par with the execrable Judy Garland version), whereas their creative impetus drove them into dark psychological territory. The end result is striking.

Anyway, the story deals with an evil Nome King who resembles the rock eating fella from Neverending Story II, a witch named Nombi and freakish, almost hallucinogenic baddies named Wheelers, since they walk around on long stilt-length lens connected to wheels...

It's no surprise she grew up to be a great, quirky actor.

Frank Baum and Disney stodgily shied away from calling it a sequel to the 1939 movie musical of that book. Having said that - they then paid great amounts of money to Turner/MGM for the rights to use the concept of ruby slippers (silver in the original book). They also cast Dorothy as a brunette with braids as in the 1939 movie. The rest of RETURN TO OZ is filled with exquisitely realized visions based on John R. Neil's illustrations (not W. W. Denslow as the first book and 1939 film used). The story line is taken from the second and third of the 12 Baum Oz books - THE MARVELOUS LAND OF OZ and OZMA OF OZ.  (Remember this was before movies like LORD OF THE RINGS and HARRY POTTER made sticking to a book's storyline fashionable). This blending leaves some characters unexplained and many characters with too little background info. A wholly frightening and unnecessarily opening sequence is also added featuring Dorothy going for shock-therapy treatments to forget about Oz (!). In addition the entire film was shot in England (obviously not Kansas in the film) and cast with many British actors who keep their accents. This seems odd in what is the quintessential American fairy tale. The score while beautiful is heavy handed and we see far too little of the beautiful Oz and far too much of Oz in ruins. The distance between the Emerald City and where Dorothy's house fell seems ridiculously short taken into account the first stories adventures. I will say that Tik Toc, Jack Pumpkinhead, and the Gump are amazingly well done. The scarecrow is ok - but looks like a rubber puppet. The Tin Man is beautiful but has almost nothing to do. This is one of those almost movies - but keep it in mind for older children as some bits are dark and frightening. For children who know Oz via the books and not just Judy Garland - it's a fantastic journey that appears to be at least partially full of actual Oz citizens.

Nicol Williamson makes for a wry Nome King, toying with his captives simply because it's more fun, and supporting villains Mombi and the Wheelers are delightfully bizarre. The production design, firmly rooted in the world of Victorian children's book illustration, is strangely novel, and unlike that of any fantasy film I've seen.  It's an elegant, dreamlike mutation of 1900's reality.  It gives one the sense of peering directly into the mind of a period illustrator, like Winsor McCay.

Less effective for adults compared to films like Time Bandits and the original Wizard of Oz.The plot set-up is a little unconvincing, as it has Aunt Emm so upset over Dorothy's continual talk of Oz that she sends her for electroshock therapy! Dorothy and another girl escape from the sanitarium and a river whisks her away to the land of Oz again. Ruinously, she has brought an annoying chicken instead of her faithful dog Toto. Once in Oz the chicken is able to speak English through the magic of Oz, with no explanation as to why this didn't happen to Toto. She finds all her friends have been turned to stone except the scarecrow who has been abducted by the evil Nome King. Her confrontation with the witch who has a collection of removable heads is probably the film's high point. The sets are incredible, basically a hall of mirrors with Victorian gold and brass embellishments that puts the original film's sets to shame. Dorothy is captured by the witch, who intends to make her an addition to her collection of heads once she's grown a bit. She manages to escape with the aid of her friends and some magic powder of life, then sets off to find the Nome King.Nicol Williamson's performance as the Nome King is interesting but nowhere near his classic turn as Merlin in Excalibur. Sad to say that dude is more memorable and effective when he's completely over the top. Personally I think the scene where he was dispatched was quite a bit anti-climactic. His exit line eggs are poison is nowhere near as memorable as I'm melting! I'm melting! What a world, what a world!.Fairuza Balk turns in a very competent child performance. Harder than it seems. The biggest problem I had was with the chicken, which was only marginally less annoying than Jar Jar Binks. I can't remember a time in my childhood where a character like that would actually be endearing. Denise Bryer's voice is totally inappropriate and grating, and her Midwest/southern accent is very unconvincing. The animatronics are good on the chicken, and indeed all the puppets in the film are very well done. The effects in general have held up well. The Nome King is mostly done with stop motion though there are some scenes with Williamson with a lot of makeup on, looks like a real pain to put on. Tic-Toc is a particularly convincing puppet. The mattes are a bit too elaborate to be fully convincing.On the whole a pleasing fantasy film that presents only mildly annoying elements for adults and a lot of good dark fantasy elements that will appeal to both kids and adults. May disappoint fans of the original as there is no singing and dancing here and we see very little of the original group of Dorothy's friends. The film also strays pretty far from Baum's mythos, including use of the device where the elements she comes across in Oz are reflections of people or places she's been in Kansas. This was not an element in Baum's stories but seems to have been imported here to stay closer to the 39 version. I think this film will excite the young, might be scary for very young kids, but the effects are still good enough to pass grade and the film may even inspire some kids to pick up some of Baum's books after they finish with old Harry Potter.

Thankfully my parents never sheltered me from the world, by deciding for me what fairy tales I should be allowed to watch. Instead my father was always updating our collection, and being as excited as my brother and I were to watch them. So I never missed out on this beautiful film. I have never read the Wizard Of Oz novels, so my personal liking of this movie has nothing to do with that.I was about six years old when my father brought home this masterpiece. I did enjoy the first film to some extent, but I was never a fan. I remember loving ToTo, the Scarecrow, the Tinman and the Good Witch. I personally didn't like Dorothy and I can't even find a word to describe how I felt about the Cowardly Lion. Mostly I remember thinking how ugly, annoying and stupid he looked; telling my parents THAT'S NOT A LION! All in all, I'd watch the film and wait until Dorothy meets the Scarecrow and from there start enjoying it.On the other hand, Return To Oz just blew me away. I loved Dorothy immediately and was very happy to see ToTo again. I was very young, so I didn't quite understand why they put her in the hospital or that whatever the doctors did to Dorothy, was not what they were supposed to do. I'm explaining everything from my point of view at the time when I watched it. I'm always very surprised at the drastic way the story lines suddenly change for me, whenever I watch a fairytale today.All I can say, is that I was as afraid as she was, especially cause I already had a phobia for hospitals. This film didn't do anything to me, except show me what I believed hospitals were really like! Starting from there, this film made the story feel real to me. That's why Return To Oz is such a beautiful film. Children view the world in their own way; hold their own beliefs. This film excels at making the story come alive. It has so many things that are scary to most children and brings them together beautifully! Being away from home, the hospital, night, the storm, the rough sea/river and then the deserted Oz. And its all just the atmosphere, so scary without any monsters or witches! This makes it enjoyable for adults to watch with their kids and be able to understand the fear, rather than know these things are not real.I felt so sad seeing the broken Yellow Brick Road and Emerald City lie in ruins. That unsettling quiet, deserted place was so eerie. Again its still just atmosphere; war does the same! The stone statues, the whole architecture is just so beautiful and melancholic at the same time. Then came the Wheelers; the second part that terrified me after the hospital. The chase was breathtaking, keeps you at the edge of your seat. Not to mention, they're human. Personally, I always thought humans made the best villains. The scenery works so well, the normality of it makes it all the more frightening. These humans on wheels, amidst all these statues, in broad daylight.The palace was so beautiful. It sort of looked like a church, the mirrors, the organ (at least, that's what I heard). It felt safe. I remember thinking how truly beautiful and angelic, Princess Mombi looked. At least, until she revealed the corridor with the heads in showcases. I actually felt better when she first changed her head, I could see the cruelty. Then came the third terrifying part. The stealth to steal the key from the sleeping, headless Mombi is so unnerving, made me hold my breath. Then to get the powder from the showcase with the sleeping head, then the chase and the escape. Everything the way, every good fairytale should be; beautiful yet intense! Flying into the night, every child's dream. The scenery so wonderful and eerily disturbing at the same time! And then it starts falling apart, like a plane about to crash if it was a convertible! Mombi going after Dorothy, riding the Wheelers; like a carriage from hell. Another grim but beautifully done scene in a Gothic style dungeon.The thrilling chilly ride of the whole movie makes the climax at the end feel that much more gratifying, than any other fairytale with a happy ending. Its a really bright, shining light at the end of the dark tunnel. The way Emerald city comes back to life is truly magical. The beautiful statues, Mombi's showcase victims, the Wheelers and Dorothy's lost friends. The princess coming out of the mirror, the palace, the celebrations; Emerald City never shined this way in Wizard Of Oz. And finally, the Cowardly Lion was as the name should suggest, A LION! So, of course this magical tale deserves a 10! It connects with you and makes you feel real emotions; fear, suspense, sadness, happiness, Everything! It never gave me any nightmares; parts of it are as scary because its the done the way it should be. The story, the scenery, everything makes you delve deep inside and experience the whole RAW journey. Parents should definitely not deny their children this masterpiece. In fact they should just watch it with them. Watch as their kids learn to fear not just green faced monsters that don't exist, but the monsters with a human face. During those moments, it was enough holding my father's hand to feel secure because that's how home should feel, safe.

I don't understand all the discussion and constant mention of this being a sequel to the original Wizard of Oz?? This film is made in it's own right based on a series of books which happen to be the second and third books in the series. The film makers obviously knew that everyone already knew the story of The Wizard of Oz and therefore didn't need to go back and cover that aspect of it but instead created a film after those events. There is nothing in Return to Oz that even hints at this being a sequel. Return to Oz is EVERYTHING Wizard of Oz wasn't. It's dark, very dark, creepy, no singing whatsoever, very defined different look in each Oz character. Also when Dorothy first returns to Oz she makes it known that the desert surrounding Oz is the deadly desert which she is well aware of, something that certainly was not in the original. Sure there are some similarities and recreations taken from the first. Dorothy's character except being much younger (as she was in the books), has some very similar qualities to Judy Garland's Dorothy and even seems to have some of the same mannerisms and voice tones. The ruby slippers which were created exclusively for the original film make a reappearance BUT they are such a common staple to the story now that it's necessity to have them.If this film had been released nowadays it would have been turned into some sort of multi billion dollar franchise which would be great!! One of the only downsides to this deliciously dark creation is it's too short and misses out on some great points. The young Fairuza Balk is perfect casting as Dorothy Gale. She is mentally disturbed by the events that previously happened in Oz and her family believes her to need Psychiatric treatment. Enter the terrifying Psyciatric hospital. This film begins it's dark and at times terrifying vision of psychiatry treatment with the mysterious girl who saves Dorothy. The quality of this film is to watch everything you know about Oz and return there yourself to discover the ruins and what has happened to all the familiar characters. On top of that director Walter Murch who has since this film done some incredible work, gives new characters life such as Jack Pumpkinhead, Tik Tok, The Gump, and terrifying evil doers that makes the wicked witch look like Glenda. The Nome King played by veteran actor Nicol Williamson, and more importantly the horrifically evil Mombi played by a variety of actresses depending on what head she was wearing...yes the interchangeable heads which also makes for one of the most terrifying moment in movie history when Dorothy steals the powder of life and the heads begin to scream at her. Plenty of special effects, although a little outdated and corny at times, still beautiful setting, familiar characters, good triumphing over evil...everything that makes a classic!! Just be careful about young kids because it has that dark streak. But this one is definitely worth seeing!! 9/10 "},{"Title":"A strange mix of the original OZ & A Clockwork Orange.","Date":"1 January 2001","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Family, Fantasy","Review":"  Not a movie for the younger kids, Return To Oz is a dark fantasy set in the original Oz after almost everything has been destroyed or turned to stone.

The look of the 19th century time period is better,The main characters LOOK more like the Illustrations in the other Books. If you have or have not read any of Baums 14 OZ books,no matter, it is still a great Adaptation. The Puppets and puppetry is very good.

"},{"Title":"Middle Of The Road","Date":"20 April 2005","Score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Family, Fantasy","Review":" Return To Oz is very much like a retread of The Wizard Of Oz, with most of the major events of one film repeated in the latter. About the only significant difference is that Return To Oz, while wearing its origins as a Disney production on its sleeve, is a little less saccharine, or sugar-coated, compared to its predecessor. Not so much that it could score ten out of ten from an older audience, but enough so that you could show it to audiences who have more than one digit in their age, and not draw protests. Unfortunately, this does not necessarily make it a good film.Whereas the cast of heroes in The Wizard Of Oz were very distinct from one another, the heroes of Return To Oz are fairly generic. The plot, such as it is, concerns itself with a Troll-like King who comes out of the stone of one mountain. Somehow, he has acquired the ruby slippers from the previous film, and used them to sack the city of Oz. The populace is found turned to stone, and the streets patrolled by Wheelers, a bunch of ugly human types who look a lot like Johnny Rotten at a roller-disco. The Wheelers are controlled by an evil princess who collects heads to wear, while she is in turn controlled by the Nome King, who I've already spoken about. The plot is very simple and by the numbers, as opposed to how every new location seemed natural or spontaneous in the original. In fact, there are only three or four major locations in Return To Oz, and most of them are passed through in the blink of an eye.Children who have yet to see The Wizard Of Oz will not notice the most major problem with this sequel. In a nutshell, it is continuity. The Dorothy shown in The Wizard Of Oz was played by Judy Garland, who was about seventeen years old at the time. Disney, in their endless attempt to pander to a child audience, decided to make Dorothy ten years old, in spite of the number of references made to six months passing since the tornado hit the Gale farm. These not-so-subtle continuity faults aside, the story is competently told, and Fairuza Balk makes a decent fist of playing the young Dorothy.Another plus in Return To Oz is that the support cast is considerably less annoying in its perpetual perkiness. Tik-Tok has more personality than the entire cast of The Wizard Of Oz put together, while Pumpkinhead manages to be dopey without seeming insulting. Something that was utterly beyond the cast of... well, you get the idea. Another plus is that we are spared the agony of the cast breaking into song every ten minutes. The only point where the film falls down is when the weight of the Disney desire to claim that they are making films suitable for everyone when in reality they are only suitable for four-year-olds becomes too much for the screenplay and actors to deal with. Quite obviously, this sequel was churned out in order to make a quick buck, as the minor flood of spin-offs of the time showed. Still, it gets a little closer to the tone of L. Frank Baum's novel, and that can only be a good thing.All in all, I gave Return To Oz a five out of five. Unlike the everyone loves it, we say so advertising that is prevalent in trying to sell The Wizard Of Oz, Disney seem to have adopted a here it is, take it or leave it attitude to Return To Oz. Which is the biggest improvement I can think of.

Frank Baum's novels. This is sort of a follow-up to the 1939 classic, The Wizard of Oz and Balk (The Craft) fills the role of the late, Judy Garland as Dorothy Gale who is back in Kansas and can't stop forgetting about her recent trip to the magical land of Oz. Laurie (Carrie) plays her Aunt Em who decides to get her medical care. Soon, Dorothy finds herself back in Oz after a mysterious girl (Emma Ridley) helps her escape shock treatment. Dorothy meets new friends and reunites with old ones while trying to stop an evil witch, Mombi (Marsh) and Nome King (Williamson) from destroying it. Marsh (Willow) also plays Nurse Wilson, Williamson (Spawn) also plays Dr. Worley and Clark (Back to the Future III) plays Uncle Henry. This is a bizarre, underrated film that's definitely darker than it's predecessor. I've enjoyed it since I was a kid, Balk & the cast are great in it, there's neat effects and David Shire's score is also good. I recommend this.

Yes it is intended to follow on from the original 1939 classic, and one would hope to see Judy Garland once again reprise the role of Dorothy, had this unofficial sequel been made sooner and of course before Garland sadly passed (God rest her soul). Fairuza Balk however does exceptionally well as Dorothy Gale. One would wonder why, if this is a sequel, why she is younger than her original character in The Wizard Of Oz?? Surely she'd be slightly older in this one?I do like how the film has it's own intake to that completely different to the original - the chicken 'Billina' replacing the dog 'Toto'. Surely Dorothy isn't Dorothy without her dog. And a few people in these message boards think of this movie as a horror - I wouldn't say so exactly but it does have it's chilling moments - the heads in the glass cabinets and the dark dreary music during that scene... and yes The Wheelers!The Cast - All in the all, the cast are great. I only wish Piper Laurie (Aunt Em) was featured more in the film. Such a wonderful actress and she was just terrific in Carrie (1976). She also co-starred in a 1988 TV movie Go Toward The Light alongside Linda Hamilton, whom I have met twice at the London Film & Comic Con. I have also met Jean Marsh (Nurse Wilson/Princess Mombi) at the conventions. I had a lovely conversation with her regarding her role in this movie and who cannot forget her role as Queen Bavmorda in Willow (1988). Quality actress. I do think she plays both roles of Nurse Wilson & Mombi very well.I wonder where the lunch-pail comes into it? And it's a shame we never see much of the Yellow Brick Road. As I've mentioned already, maybe this film isn't untended to be that close to The Wizard Of Oz. It tells it's own story in it's own way. I've grown up watching this film, and at the age of 28 now, I still love it. It was however made 1-year before I was born but I was a huge 80s child. Labyrinth (1986) is definitely my film and I shall be reviewing about that film soon enough! RETURN TO OZ is definitely up there in my Top 5 80s films and if you do have kids that haven't already seen this, sit them down they will love it... just beware of The Wheelers!

One of those Disney misfires that still remains flawed fun, like Tron, Black Hole, and The Black Cauldron. (By-the way, I also liked John Carter--see my review) A horrible beginning. Electroshock for Dorothy in an Insane Asylum? Nobody believes that she went to Oz, so she must be crazy. She runs away, falls in the river, and emerges in Oz. (Dorothy never returned to Oz the same way twice--read the books.) In some ways, way too faithful to the series of Oz books. Strange and wonderful special effects, a lot of them fascinating mechanical and animatronic puppetry, plus a brilliant Hall of the Gnome King Claymation animation sequence. This may actually appeal more to adults than children, who I suspect had nightmares when the witch Mombi changes her head. Most of the sidekicks are more-than-odd looking, like Tick-Tock, who is a shiny tin-man-potbellied walking timepiece. The Wheelers are scary-creepy. Pumpkinhead is played by Brian Henson. Your typical scarecrow, lion and tin woodsman, look nothing like the beautifully costumed creatures in the 1939 version. Instead, they look exactly like the cartoon illustrations from the Oz books. This Oz is also a very dreary place. It is in ruins and Dorothy must somehow restore it to it's former glory. Basically, an adventure story and certainly not a musical. As she travels throughout Oz, she is always trying to find her way back home, while being chased by magical and monstrous villains. The little girl playing Dorothy is outstanding, considering the gloomy story she had to deal with. A dirty dusty Disney transfer doesn't help, either. Someday I must get to Kansas. I suspect the whole place is in sepia tone or black and white!

I first watched it when I was 14 years old and I seemed to be a bit impressed by it. OK, it's not as strong as the original due to it's flaws, but it's a very good sequel and a very underrated one at that.First of all, I like how the story doesn't repeat the original and it's darker tone is represented well throughout the film, but aside from it's decent character development, it does derive itself from two books of the Oz series Land of Oz and Ozma of Oz. The script does have it's problems with several scenes that were completely cut.Flaws aside, everything is done perfectly. The cinematography is brilliant, the stop motion effects on the Nomes, although dated back then, are splendid, the scenery is beautiful, the costumes and make-up on the new characters including the villain Mombi, the Nome King, Jack the Pumpkinhead, and others are perfect. The direction from editor Walter Murch is solid and builds a lot of tense and atmosphere to the darker tone of the film; the music from David Shire is pretty good too. The best part goes to the cast of actors. Fairuza Balk did a fantastic job portraying a much younger Dorothy (don't get me wrong. Judy Garland's role as Dorothy was timeless), Jean Marsh is a menacing Mombi, Brian Henson is a wonderful sidekick Jack the Pumpkinhead and Nicol Williamson is a frightening Nome King.Overall, Return to Oz isn't as excellent as The Wizard of Oz, but I can see why this got a cult following over the past few years and I would recommend this to those who haven't seen it.

I'll say that no matter how much flak I get for it","Date":"18 November 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Family, Fantasy","Review":" One of the many problems I had with the original Wizard Of Oz is that the movie was too bright, happy and perfect (aside from the Wicked Witch, it's a magical Utopia). Reading about this I heard that it was... not like that to say the least. Thaat intrigued me to sit down and watch it.First of all Fairuza Balk is a MUCH better Dorothy than Judy Garland. I found her acting better than Garland's. Again I might get flak for saying that but I actually enjoyed her performance, whereas with Garland I found her acting flat.The basic plot is that it is 6 months since Dorothy's Oz visit (judging on what things look like in Oz, I'm assuming it's non-canon with the 1939 film) and she has trouble sleeping. Aunt Em is concerned for her and decides to send her to a hospital of some kind, when Dr Worley (played by Nicol Williamson) decides to somehow remove electricity from Dorothy's brain about Oz there is a power blackout and a mysterious girl helps her escape.Soon Dorothy is back in the land of Oz with one of her chickens who can now talk (I know... weird) and finds out that Oz is not the place she remembered with The Gnome King (played by Williamson, again) and Princess Mombi ruling Oz (or what's left of it). Along the way she meets a clockwork robot, a flying moose-head sofa hybrid (Again... weird) and a man made out of wood with a Pumpkin for a head. Together they embark on a journey to stop the Gnome King and rescue The Scarecrow (because of 2 reasons, firstly he was The King of Oz and he's the only friend of Dorothy's that wasn't turned to stone).Unlike other people, I enjoyed this even more than the 1939 version. I found the performances of the actors better, no annoying musical numbers (like the Munchkin song). I would recommend it to people who want to see a good fantasy/kids film. Although if you have kids of a young age (like 4-7) then don't show it to them, the Gnome king could be intimidating to them. However if you're over that age you should be fine.

None of them read the original books by L. Frank Baum, of course; if they did, they'd know that Return to Oz, with its dark humor and wild, nonsensical imagination, is much closer in tone to the books than the 1939 film ever was - which was, on the contrary, a much lighter and cleaner take on them.For any fan of the book, Return to Oz is a real joy. They'll easily recognize it as a combination of elements from the two first sequels to The Wonderful Wizard of Oz - The Marvelous Land of Oz (Jack Pumpkinhead, Mombi, The Gump) and Ozma of Oz (The Nome King, Tik-Tok, the Wheelers, Billina). These books aren't as globally famous as the first one, but they're just as good, some may say better; and the film did a fantastic job of adapting Baum's wittiness, imagination and knack for nonsensical dialog. The various creatures described in the text were transferred to the big screen with stop-motion, puppets and costume effects that may be out-of-date, but are so richly imaginative and stylish that it's impossible to imagine them replaced by CGI; they fit Baum's vision so well.The film, of course, needs to be measured by its own merits and not just as an adaptation of the source material; as such, some flaws must be acknowledged. Some lines in it may seem silly or cheesy to most viewers, and some scenes are so wildly nonsensical that they may end up throwing the viewer right out of the story. It may also be difficult for it to find its right audience - it may indeed be too scary for very young children, and too silly for more uptight adults. But it's a wonderful film for the young at heart, and also for slightly older children or ones with an open mind and a sense of imagination - as long as they aren't turned off by the relatively slow pace and hand-made effects, which are radically different than what modern children's movies may have accustomed them to. Return to Oz may never be everybody's cup of tea, but after bombing in the box office it thankfully got the recognition it deserved as a beloved, if somewhat obscure, cult classic.

In that time, she has become depressed and is having trouble sleeping properly, so it's decided by her Aunt Em that it's high time her niece is whisked off to a mental hospital whereby an experimental form of electric shock treatment be administered to erase her troublesome memories. Hardly the introduction you might expect to a sequel to one of the most loved family films ever made, but it sets the tone perfectly for what is a bizarrely nightmarish second trip to Oz. So, what has changed? A lot. One of the smartest decisions is not to include any song or dance numbers, although it's surprising not to hear even the slightest nod in the orchestral score to the celebrated music of the original. To it's credit, this is a film that wants to stand on it's own two ruby slippers and oddly, it somehow just about pulls it off. Make no mistake, this is dark stuff with it's roots firmly planted in horror territory. Tonally, it's reminiscent of 'Evil Dead' era Sam Raimi in places, especially so with the usage of the now dated Claymation effects procedure. Like the original, this is sure to have created it's fair share of nightmares in younger viewers and it's often surprising just how creepy it is. After an unusual Kansas introduction, Dorothy &#x96; a slightly snotty looking Fairuza Balk, inevitably finds herself back in Oz, a place that appears to have been bereft of life for many years. It's like Alice in not-so wonderland as Dorothy discovers to her horror, that evil rules and her friends are long gone. So starts the quest to find answers. As in the 1939 original, we meet a host of unusual characters to help along the way. We have a talking chicken, a moose head attached to a bed and variations on 'Tin Man' and 'Scarecrow'. Where in the original our travelling helpers had a story arc of their own, this time they are simply along for the ride which again, is a prudent move from the makers. It's particularly pleasing just how little repetition there is from the original film, and although Oz doesn't look as colorful or inviting this time around, it's still a suitably magical land where all seems possible. Although released as an unofficial sequel, the film has garnered cult status over the years with a solid fanbase of appreciation. In the end, it's no classic, but it's an enjoyable enough fantasy ride set in a land that sparked the creative imaginations of so many and deserves credit for using the legacy of Oz to create a new adventure without resorting to out and out plagiarism.

After watching it, I'm kind of caught somewhere in between. It's a hard one to figure out. I loved the dark approach and melancholy vibe which surrounded every scene, even those moments before Dorothy finds herself in Oz. Like those dreary sequences on the farm or in the mental hospital. The cast attached are sensational; Fairuza Balk evokes the spirit as Dorothy. Nicol Williamson and Jean Marsh are memorable in their dual villainous roles. Piper Laurie and Matt Clark are fine-tuned as Dorothy's Aunt and uncle. Nonetheless the real stars are the creations that come out of Oz. There are a bunch of new vivid characters on Dorothy's journey, even though the Scarecrow, Tin-Man and cowardly Lion do appear. They're nothing more than cameos here. The new creations; Tik-Tok, Jack Pumpkinhead, Gump and Billina a talking chicken (that takes over Toto) take centre stage. Impressive in details and design, especially the puppetry work and stop-motion. The world that was created was surreal and inventive with a real Gothic air, but the grounded story which was virtually one set-piece after another seemed to have a stop and go pattern where it would slow down where not much would be happening and the sense of wonder simply languishing, despite the eccentrics of the imagery's and performances. No bright, cheerful musical interludes here either. Instead it goes for thrills&#x85; grim, creepy and they're effectively done.

I was born three years after its release, but remember vividly watching a VHS copy that my my sister taped off of TV. It was a striking film, haunting and joyful. In the same spirit as other 80's fantasy (The Dark Crystal, Neverending Story, etc), it was a dark ride. When I saw it on DVD last year, I had to grab it! While it is not an official sequel to the classic Judy Garland film, it could be viewed that way, or as a stand-alone film. It opens a few months after Dorothy returns from Oz. Missing her friends, and unable to sleep, Aunt Em takes her to Dr. Worley, who plans on using the latest therapy (electro-shock) to cure her of what he believes are delusions and dreams. However, another patient of Worley helps Dorothy escape, and she is swept up in a river, passing out. She awakens back in Oz, with her pet chicken Belina (Toto remained behind in Kansas), to discover that Oz is in ruins. The yellow brick road is faded and tattered, the Emerald City has been ransacked, and everyone in the kingdom has been turned to stone. Worse, strange demonic creatures called Wheelers live there now, under the control of the evil witch Mombi and the dreaded Nome King. Dorothy must team up with new friends (including the clockwork solider Tick-Tock, the kind-hearted Jack Pumpkinhead, and the strange being called the Gump) to stop Mombi and the Nome King, and restore Oz to its past glory.The film is quite a departure from the colorful, joyful Oz we are all used to. The film has an unrelenting sense of dread and melancholy that will initially shock you. But there is also a great deal of creativity to the film, and it does lighten up towards the end. Like I said, this is very much an 80's fantasy movie, back when family films were dark, edgy and sometimes downright tragic. It is for a specific audience, and may not be appropriate for all children.From an aesthetic standpoint, the film is very remarkable. Murch's direction is phenomenal (it's too bad he never directed another film), the set design is truly eerie, the creature design is frightening and effective. It's all so perfect for the dark tone. The musical score by David Shire is completely beautiful, in addition, and covers a lot of emotions- the music will bring a tear to your eye, I guarantee it.The acting is also very strong. Fairuza Baulk makes an excellent Dorothy, and at times, seems to channel the innocence of Judy Garland. The voice actors who provide the character to her new friends (particularly Brian Henson as Jack Pumpkinhead) are a lot of fun, and Jean Marsh as Mombi is terrifying.There are some problems with the film, though. Despite being longer than the 30's version, it felt like less was accomplished. It does drag, and Dorothy and her friends don't go to many places. It's a bit too straight forward, and could have used one or two more scenes of the gang getting into various misadventures. Also, the sense of dread may be too much for some to handle, and could turn some audiences off.But that being said, if you enjoy dark, brooding fantasies, this is a great film! I loved it as a kid, and would recommend it to any Oz fan! I give it a 9 out of 10!

That said, when I saw the movie this afternoon, I could not break myself away from it. It was that good.This was not the weepy tale I saw as a child back in the Sixties. This is a dark tale that seems to adhere more to the tone of L. Frank Baum's novels. This is definitely not for young kids. If some of the effects are dated, they would be for the 1939 film as well.But it is the story that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's funny that this was Walter Murch's sole movie directorial effort, because he does a good job with what he has. Overall, the movie is an accomplishment just because it is a live-action Oz movie, and it deserves praise for its story and production values.

I remember seeing it years ago, but it didn't stick with me the way Labyrinth, The Dark Crystal or The Never-ending Story did. The talking rocks done in stop-motion is some of the best I've seen, a beautiful thing from before the days of CG. The Characters Tick-Tock and Jack are puppeteer-ed very well. Some cheesy moments but overall it's excellent, especially for those who enjoy puppets and stylized art with that Tim Burtonian feel. It's at least better than what one would expect from a medium budget, Disney movie from the 80's.

Oz especially has a naturally creepy quality to it even though people like to whitewash the experience and talk about how sweet the whole thing is. even the old 1930's Judy Garland movie gives me the creepy crawls, that's why i think it's so incredibly funny.kids movies and entertainments are surreal and very dream like and often, like dreams, give us a look at our inner longings and beliefs. Disney princess movies in particular can seem a little grandiose and deluded. sometimes i'm surprised with all the waxing' weirdness that goes on in kids shows, it's a wonder more kids don't grow up more demented.'Return to Oz' is a weird film. that's cool. the old movie was weird. the book was weird. the guy who told it was kind of weird. cool.

Then, the fantasy part in Oz starts, but is still somewhat strange and creepy. I guess this was a good movie for the time it was made I'm not a big fan of 80's movies, but this was good.

This version has with Fairuza Balk a Dorothy that has the right age. Her performance is really top notch. This movie has no happy songs at all and comes close to being a thriller. However I still think it is suitable for children as it never gets bloody or gory. The scene with the witch with all the changeable heads is scary at first but really well done and becomes quite funny. Although none of the original protagonists (except for Dorothy) play a major role in this movie, their substitutes are just as good. It does have a stronger and more suspenseful plot than the original but I cannot say that I enjoyed one more than the other as I love both. So I give both movies the same rating.

I'm glad that I did as it was a great film containing scares, thrills and some fine new characters. Like just about everybody else I was familiar with Judy Garland's portrayal of Dorothy and was interested to see how another actress would approach the role; it is immediately clear that Fairuza Balk's Dorothy will be quite different, for a start she is several years younger and somewhat more troubled. Her family don't believe her story of visiting Oz and take her to a rather creepy hospital where she is to undergo electro-shock treatment. Just as the treatment is about to start lightning causes a power cut and Dorothy escapes with the help of a mysterious girl. As they flee they fall into a swollen river and Dorothy climbs onto a makeshift raft and falls asleep. When she awakens she is shocked to find that she has a talking chicken for company she soon realises she must be back in Oz and sets off towards the Emerald City to find her old friends. Things start badly when she discovers that the yellow brick road has been destroyed and get worse when she finds the Emerald City itself is in ruins; its population have been turned to stone and there are strange and dangerous creatures called Wheelers patrolling its streets. While hiding from them she finds a new friend; a clockwork soldier called Tic-Tok who helps her fight off the Wheelers and gets the information she needs to find the Scarecrow. This doesn't mean her problems are over, she must still confront Princess Mombi, a frightening woman who has a collection of interchangeable heads who wishes to add Dorothy's to her collection and the Nome King, the rock monster who is holding the scarecrow.Young Fairuza Balk did a great job as Dorothy, it can't have been easy for an eleven year old to take on one of the most iconic roles in cinema history. Those wanting to see her old friends may be a little disappointed as they only play a small part in her adventure however her new friends are a lot of fun and even stranger... one is a creature made up of a green moose head attached to a sofa. A few of the special effects look a bit dated now but in the case of the claymation rock creatures this just adds to their creepiness. This film is considerably darker than the original; the previously bright World of Oz seems to be in a terminal state of decay and there are no bright songs to lighten the tone. I can see why it would give some children nightmares, the wheelers, Mombi and the rock creatures are all positively creepy and there is a fair greater sense of danger this time.

Probably and don't get me wrong, this is not a Godfather Part 2, or Empire Strikes back level triumph. But what Return to Oz is, is a highly enjoyable, fast paced and creepy adventure romp which succeeds on many levels where the original failed.As a kid I was terrified by this film. I'm just a poor boy from a working class family, we didn't have a VHS machine, but my Nan did. So we'd stay at her house and watch this movie and get absolutely scared witless by the creepy hospital where they zapped kid's brains with electricity and turned them into whaling vegetables. And the creepy Doctor, who looks a lot like that the creepy statue guy at the end of the film, and the nurse who looks just like that scary lady with the collection of heads.As an adult I can't help but get taken away in this story, an almost Gothic reboot of the original family musical with heavy undertones, an underlying sense of decadence and some truly frightening villains. And our heroes, we're they're all just lovely. All innocents. In short you like the good guys, hate the bad guys and can't help but find the whole thing a little creepy. So much more fun than the sex scenes, coarseness, and moral ambiguity of all those movies made for grown ups, and no less entertaining.I was taken away on the magic carpet ride (or maybe gump ride would be more appropriate) as a five year old and it's no less magic now a quarter of a century later.

Her appearance as Dorothy was more fitting to the Dorothy of the book than Judy Garland was as a teenager, yet we know Judy Garland's role was a classic role.This fantasy was based on two of the Frank L. Baum books follow-up to the Wizard of Oz that resulted in the 1939 classics. The setting of Return to Oz was 6 months after Dorothy returned from Land of Oz, but her mind still obsessed with the place despite she was told it was a dream. She found a key felt out of the sky, and she felt there was trouble in the Land of Oz. Because of her obsession, she was placed in a Psych ward. Eventually, she found a way get to the Land of Oz, and found all the beauty of the was gone and everyone turned to stones.This time, instead of Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion, we have a Pumpkinhead, a talking chicken, and a talking computer. Instead of Wicked Witch of the West, we have an evil lady named Mombi. Instead of flying monkeys, we have people with hands and feet with wheels. Instead of the Oz, we have The Nome King. So as you see, there was some similar structure to Wizard of Oz.Despite this is a children movie, the are scenes with Mombi that I think would scare the hell out of children. She collected women heads and change her heads like changing clothes. Although the quality of this movie was far from that of the 1939 classics since it looked more like a TV movie. The adventure of Dorothy preserving the Land of Oz was however fascinating enough to keep me interested.

I just recently watched it again for the first time in ten years, with added adult perspective. Yes, it is a frightening movie. I was terrified of the headless Mombi (props to the Hensons, as always). More surprising is what did not scare me. I wasn't afraid of the Nome King and his booming voice, or of the delightfully '80s vintage Wheelers. And I was not frightened, as I am now, by the prospect of electroshock on a little girl.This movie combines many of the features of the 1939 Wizard of Oz with story lines from Baum's second and third Oz books. It's the same sort of mishmash, with details that are more often true to the older movie than the books. It also continues the theme of the people of Oz appearing as characters in Dorothy's life before she gets there, leaving the question of whether Oz is a dream--although this movie's conclusion is far more absolute on the subject.I would not necessarily recommend this movie for devoted fans of the original Wizard of Oz. It is more a movie for fans of Labyrinth, Never Ending Story, and the other works of '80s fantasy. It will most certainly not frighten all children, but will equally certainly frighten some. I still find it delightful. "}{"Title":"Not Your Grandfather's MGM Musical","Date":"19 July 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Family, Fantasy","Review":" --or your father's. Or from MGM. Or even a musical. But I list this among my few cinematic guilty pleasures, essentially for the following reasonsIt hews closer to the OZ that L. Frank Baum intended in his many books. Perhaps not as close as some purists would like, but at least the effort was made and showed on-screen. Budgetary constraints doubtless necessitated the melding of plots from at least two of Baum's books and the altered though muted depiction of some characters we'd hitherto seen dancing and singing around Judy Garland.Pre-CGI FX by some folks who worked on the James Bond and Superman flicks, Muppet Labs, and the Will Vinton Studios, they of the California Raisins. A genuine treat!Always a pleasure to see Jean Marsh and Nicol Williamson. Watch his performance very closely when Dorothy Gale first meets The Nome King.David Shire's musical score is excellent.And I just dig those Wheelers. You'll wish you could be like them too.A bit of trivia First, Walter Murch is an Oscar-winning editor and sound man. He directed precisely one feature-length film. If you want to study a feature-length film directed by an editor and sound man, this is it. If you want to compare with the works of a director who pays far more attention than industry average to editing and sound, Peter Weir's the man.The story's told that early on in the production Murch realized what he'd gotten himself into, and friends of his from his work on prior films showed up and graciously asked to help, among them George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola.And, inveterate credit-watcher that I am, one of the storyboard artists later directed The Nightmare Before Christmas and a puppeteer later directed The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, on which I've also commented as an IMDb user.In a phrase, this sequel will definitely surprise, stick to and grow on you. One result is that you likely won't regard chickens and eggs in quite the same way, ever again. Enjoy!

Though some minor hat-tips were made to the original movie, making it a cursory sequel only.For instance, the Ruby Slippers in the first movie were Silver Slippers in the book. Here, they make reference to Dorothy using Ruby Slippers in her previous adventure out of deference to that movie.However, the books have much more of a dark, foreboding tone than the saccharine sweetness of the original movie.

In truth, it was the first attempt to, what is called nowadays in Hollywood, Re-Boot a franchise; i.e Superman Returns, Batman Begins, the upcoming The Hulk (a mere five years after the first Hulk). Walter Murch's desire was to make a film that reflects the spirit and the look of the source material. Taken from this perspective, the film succeeds spectacularly.Early drafts of the screenplay had the Nome King wearing Ozma's magic belt (those who've read the books know what this is), and then the silver slippers from the original book. Under threat of a lawsuit from MGM (who believes to this day that they own any and all rights to anything remotely connected to OZ even though the books the movie was based on have been public domain since the 60's) Disney cowardly forced the filmmakers to make the change to Ruby Slippers, thereby implying that the movie was a sequel. Steven Spielberg, Francis Ford Coppola, and George Lucas reportedly helped Murch behind the scenes. Unfortunately, this movie was made during the time the same group were lobbying to bring in Michael Eisner to head Disney. Eisner proceed to dump the film as a remnant of the old regime.For those who can only think of OZ in terms of MGM and Judy Garland, stay away.For those who can look beyond MGM and Judy Garland, and would like a brief cinematic glimpse into L.Frank Baum's original American Fairyland, this movie is for you.

And do not judge it harshly because of the Original, which is a good movie also. But the problem with The Wizard of Oz (1939) is that it lacks some sense of dread and danger. Sure the Wicked Witch of the West is scary, but not terrifying. This story can, off course, scare little children. But for those with far-fetched imagination, this story will certainly entertain endlessly.Some of the scary scenes are those of the Headless witch Momby and her exchanging heads, the Wheelers and the Nome King and his Nomes, who are nothing more but talking rocks. The movie plays like a dream and has an auteristic touch. But it starts out rather bizarre and depressing. Not to mention dark.It's some time since The Wizard of Oz (a few months) and Dorothy Gale is sent to a psychiatrist with evil intentions. He works with electricity and calls it a miracle. So he's going to give Dorothy shock therapy. After a storm knocks out the power Dorothy and another girl run into the storm and fall into a flooding river. So Dorothy find herself back once again in Oz.But the Munchkin Village is gone (the house is there) and the Yellowbrick road half-destroyed. Soon she finds that the Emerald City has been conquered by the Nome King and is now under the rule of his servant Mombi who calls herself queen. Soon, with the help of Jack Pumpkinhead and Tic-Toc, a mechanical soldier, she sets out to the Nome King's mountain across the Deadly Desert to rescue Oz from his evil.This is an atmospheric and fascinating movie (if you ignore the existance of the first one). But it has problems to which I shall now turn.What infuriates me about this movie (and infuriated me about all other Oz movies) is that it makes the Land of Oz a dreamland, like Wonderland. It sets out to make it all look more dreamlike (and succeeds). But in the books it all seemed less Freudian.Also it's terribly Freudian. The lunchpale trees' 'fruit' (another problem) looks like her lunchpale, only more natural. The Wheelers look like the Hospital Orderly and who's beds squeak like their wheels do in Oz. The Evil Nurse is obviously Mombi and the Doctor is the Nome King. Jack Pumpkin head is obvious as the Jack o'Lantern in Dorothy's room. And Tic-Toc the doctor's machine. It's so Freudian it's terrible.The afore-mentioned lunchpale tree is too fantastic to take seriously.Other than that I like this movie, although I should admit it's not everyone's cup of tea. It is sort of like Philip Pullman's take on Oz.

I can remember turning my sofa into a gump and building tik tok out of bottles and cans.unfortunatley, the movie we had some how either got lost or taped over and became only a memory. But one day many years later I found it in a store in the half price rack. I took it home and for the first time saw the movie in its entirety. being alot older, I understood it alot better than I had when I was a little kid.It wasn't till I showed it to my younger cousins that I realized that some of this movie is quite frightening.I would sit and watch them continuously hide there eyes from mombi and the other creators that now inhabited oz. we didn't even make it to the nome kings mountain.although, this movie is very dark, me only realizing it now, you have to remember that all the oz books were very dark. If you have ever read the wizard of oz you would see that it is full of blood and gore. You have a man that continuosly chops of his body parts, a house smashing a person, trees that have faces have all their limbs choped off and shake in pain,  and cat has his head choped off, and on and on. The 39' classic musical, even though a butifully written wonderful adaption to the idea of oz, it in no way comes close to the actual story. This movie, however, captures, as best as possible, ozma of oz and the land of oz the way they are in the book. If you did read the books you would see that there is no place for singing and dancing.as for the inconsitancies in the movie with the wizard of oz, I do remember being a little confused but just kind of dismissing it because the movie was so enchanting. But, I think the makers put the allusions to the first movie there because they had to. other wise no one would have payed any atttention to it wasn't  in some way a sequel. Disney, although very aragunt and full of themselves, probably realized that they had no business going back and remaking the wizard of oz because it is such a beloved classic. If they had, no one would have cared to see it no matter how good it was. But on the other hand they couldn't very well go and make a 1930's style musical in 1985 to try and sequel the old one. so, they took the logical step they collaborated. In fact that is what the whole script is, a big collaboration of old ideas and new ideas. you have the next two books in the oz series pushed together, some of the plot twists and repeating characters from the  old movie pushed in, and then they made the thing alot more realistic and believable (something the makers of the first movie never bothered to do) and you have return to oz. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that you can't go remake the old movie and you can't make a sequel for something that dosn't have a prequel so they had to go back to the original the makers where tied to it no matter what they did. Instead of comparing the two, let them both stand alone as different movies from different eras in different genres.I think this movie is a masterpeice and shall let my kids watch it when I have kids. and if you don't agree, then you obviously really have no idea what Oz is really all about.

Yes it is scary...too scary for young viewers, yes it is DARK but that is what makes it a treasure, not happy dancing all over the place with endless singing like Wizard of Oz is ! The Nome King and the headless witch WOW, when she comes running at Dorothy screaming without a head i just sat there thinking this is absolutly nuts (with a big smile on my face) again NOT for young children ! The Nome King and his demonic ??? Soldier rock creatures are amazing the claymation is what it was supposed to be and the animatronics are great . The somewhat muted colors of the film add to its over all look and feel, not the overblown Technicolor of 1939 . This movie has many surreal and psychological undertones within it . With a open mind and many viewings you will begin to pick them out . I am not saying Wizard of Oz is a bad film, NO WAY it is a wonderful film with sets and FX WAY ahead of its time and i am not comparing (well maybe just a little) to Return to Oz but overall i enjoy return much more for its darkness and at times vicious take no CRAP from anyone Dorothy (Fairuza) as contrary to the passive and when she gets mad Judy Garland it comes across as not really frightening anyone . As i said i do love Wizard and always marvel at its huge sets and wonderful overtone . But Return gets my vote for the one of the most passed over and forgoten films .

While watching the movie, keep an eye open for certain conflicts, such as rural vs. urban, old vs. new, spirituality/faith vs. science and the theme that capitalism and technology begin acquring minds of their own rather than serving the people. Dorothy, right at the turn of the century, goes from her impoverished farm to the big city to get her Oz fantasies eradicated by a demonically smiling lobotimizing machine.  When she escapes and ends up in Oz (where CHICKENS are forbidden), the milk maids, scare crows, etc. are replaced by wheelers, essentially half human, half car.  The wheelers chastise her for picking a lunch box from a tree (obvious slam against capitalism--there is no free lunch) Despite the fact that the film initially seems to be telling us to reject technology, science, etc. completely, the presence of Tic Toc complicates this hypothesis.  When Dorothy comes upon this inactive machine which bears a physical resemblance to the lobotimizing machine at the mental hospital, SHE has the agency to make it function. Once she does this, it very clearly states that it is NOT alive and will act only as her faithful servant.Very interesting movie.

This had my curiosity piqued--and I finally got around to seeing this film.Soon after the film started, I saw just how dark it was. In this semi- sequel to The Wizard of Oz, it picks up several weeks or months after the previous film. However, continuity and realism is the key--the Gale family home is NOT magically restored like in the previous movie but WAS destroyed in the storm. As a result, Dorothy's uncle has PTSD! But even worse, when Dorothy regales her aunt with her stories of Oz, Auntie Em thinks Dorothy has lost her mind. Eventually, she takes Dorothy to an ultra-creepy clinic where a psychiatrist is planning on giving her shock treatment to stop these delusions!! Just after Dorothy is strapped down and she's about to receive a bazillion volts of electricity, a little girl shows up and saves her--and whisks her magically back to Oz.Oz has changed a lot since Dorothy left. The Nome King and Mombi (who are Oz incarnations of the evil psychiatrist and his nurse) have destroyed everything and the Emerald city is in ruins. So, it's up to Dorothy and some creepy new friends to right everything and make the kingdom a happy one once again.If this doesn't sound like a good film for your kids, you are correct. It's a film I would never dream of showing to younger kids--this would be like child abuse. But, for older and more cynical folks, it's a neat re-imagining of the books. However, there IS one major problem regardless--and reason I disliked the film. Dorothy's companion from home is NOT Toto (who is a Border Terrier in this film instead of a Cairn) but a super-annoying chicken. The voice is just awful and the comments are very often obvious and banal. I truly hated everything about this character--even if she did, inexplicably, help to save the day.

Frank Baum (The Marvelous Land of Oz, Ozma of Oz, and Tik-Tok of Oz) as a 'sequel' to MGM's 1939 musical classic The Wizard of Oz, this picture had little hope of reaching a wide, non-cynical audience. Of course newcomer Fairuza Balk could never equal the success of Judy Garland's incarnation of Dorothy Gale, but the young actress gives it an honorable try (and--surprise!--she's the best thing in the movie). Desperately unhappy being away from Oz and the characters she fell in love with there, Dorothy flees from a psychiatric institute and winds up once again walking down the Yellow Brick Road--only this time the magical trail has gone to seed, as has the Emerald City. Upon meeting a new group of friends, Dorothy hopes to save the citizens of Oz from the evil Nome King. Some of the visuals here are perhaps too dark, and the episodic nature of the movie (as well as its relentlessly downbeat tone) is wearing, yet this still ranks as a very commendable attempt to put Baum's ideas to film.

The film does look beautiful, with lovely sets and costumes, and the special effects work is some of the best of its kind of any family film of the 80s or of any decade, Tick-Tock and the Nome King are brilliantly designed. Return to Oz, with its very imaginative storytelling- seen in memorable scenes like with the heads- and enchantingly dark atmosphere, also has enough magic to engage the viewer, well to me it does anyway. The climax is chillingly effective, though Nome King did seem to be defeated too easily. Fairuza Balk is excellent as Dorothy, charming, sincere and even adorable. Many have complained that Balk is too young for the character, but in the 1939 musical Judy Garland was nearly 17 when in the book Dorothy is about 12. I also loved the music score and the cinematography, which was both dreamlike and nightmarish. Another mention should go to Nicol Williamson in the duel roles of Dr Worley and the Nome King(who may be a bit too scary for young viewers, likewise with the character of Mombi), he did a truly wonderful job in both roles, particularly the latter where he was threatening in an understated way. Also to Pumpkinhead, who a number of times, came close to stealing the show, and Tick-Tock, whose personality is perhaps the most colourful of all. The only character I didn't care for was the chicken, who is annoying at times and not really that necessary. Overall, this is a truly excellent film, that I think deserves a lot more recognition. 9/10 Bethany Cox.

That book ends with the discovery that the young hero, a boy named Tip, is the transformed Princess & proper Ruler of Oz, Ozma. Beautifully, the book tells of the change from boy to girl. Can't deal wioth that! said Disney. So they had to clumsily unite the 2nd & 3rd book into a mishmash that did not hold together. 2nd problem They were fixated on the idea that children wanted lots of violence and/or horror, so they completely changed the drift of the 2 books they were using to provide violence & horror. What they came up with was a very un-Ozzy hash of a story. Nonetheless, from the opening scene, Fairuza was Dorothy! Actually, the appearance of everything was very Ozzy - costumes, setting and all.

This is traditional storytelling in the best sense, an escapist fantasy that is simply told but packed with exciting thrills. The second was how SCARY some parts were. I know this is a kids movie, and it's told from a child's perspective, but some scenes were frightening enough to be part of a horror film. There is a scene in a sanitarium where Dorothy is tied to her bed, and you can here someone groaning in the background, possibly from electric shock treatments. Another part involving heads displayed on a wall screaming Dorothy's name also gave me the chills. Nonetheless, the story unfolds like a fairy tale, and I'd still recommend it to children.

This film is so damn dark and, at times, almost unbearably scary!Anyone expecting Judy Garland to come dancing across the screenwith Toto at her heel is in for a real shock with Return to Oz.  Munchkins, living trees and Emerald City folk have been replaced with men made out of stone (Nomes), a witch who can swap heads (Mombi) and freakish things with wheels for hands and feet (Wheelers). As you can tell, Oz has changed.  The Nome King has conquered the kingdom and imprisioned the Scarecrow King and, you've guessed it, it's up to Dorothy to save the day.Many of the characters are similar to the characters in the original film and book.  There's Bulina the talking hen (toto), Jack Pumpkinhead (The Scarecrow), Tik Tok (The Tin Woodsman) and some sort of Mooses head attached to a sofa(The Cowardly Lion, and you really have to see the film to understand).Overall, Return to Oz is a fantastic film.

The sets looked great, the villains were impressive (especially Mombi), Fairuza Balk was winning (not as arresting as she is now, but still good) and the film often had a nice quiet air of restraint and delicacy that I find uncommon in fairy tales of the era.On the other hand...there are too many characters (not surprising, as RETURN is based on two Baum books) and some get more screen time than they need. As a result, others that we ought to care about are so underdeveloped, they become annoying. Frankly, I began hoping Jack Pumpkinhead would end up as someone's dinner; he was more of a hindrance than help to Dorothy, and all her friends in general seem more like clever props than genuine personalities.The story is also almost unrelievedly spooky as the creators unfurl one eye-filling display after another, and eventually it all kind of runs together. THE WIZARD OF OZ is gooey sometimes, but when it does cough up its winged monkeys, grinning witch and scowling apple trees, I find them eerier than anything in RETURN because they're such a contrast to their surroundings.The later film's constant creepiness gets to be kind of tedious.Nevertheless, it was foolish of me to snort at the entire movie. I watched it again recently and was surprised at how much more effective it was, in spite of the complaints I still have about it. It creates a subtle sense of otherworldliness that other, more celebrated fantasies are sorely missing, and some of its scenes - like the one with the beautiful heads - have stayed in my mind ever since my first viewing. The whole thing is so visually striking, I'd recommend it for that alone.

She eventually improved, but this is not a good start.  We already established in the first movie that Dorothy is older, but now we're trying the 'Alice' effect without planning or thinking.--The forces of Evil aren't layered.  This is 'Batman' evil, too polarized to be menacing.--The director, writers, and editor are all first timers, and it shows.  The music is just bad.  Not surprising coming from the composer of '2010' and 'Short Circuit.'  The producers are from 'Police Academy' and 'Star Wars'.  No wonder Murch called on Lucas, Coppola and Spielberg for support.  No wonder he hasn't tried again in 20 years.--There is a difference between Special/Visual FX and Psychological FX.  Harryhausen pioneered the former while Murch helped Coppola with the latter.  Why didn't that same mentality translate here?What's good?--We get the photographer of 'Catch-22' with some assistance from that of 'Elephant Man''s.  Here we get some surrealism and interesting stop-motion, less artificiality from the original 'Oz.'  Meanwhile, 'Empire' remains the benchmark for stop-motion.--The design is interesting considering it's Norman Reynolds.  He takes heavy cues from Lynch and Kubrick, while still mixing in TV simplicity.  That's cheating. --The lion, scarecrow and tinman are reinvented.  They have new problems, but simpler ones.  That's the movie, wanting to maintain a sense of darkness yet still being too cute.  Tim Burton started from these concepts.--The cast, other than Fairuza, specializes in constructed fantasy having done 'Excalibur', 'Buckaroo Banzai', 'Willow', and 'Twin Peaks.'  Too bad we also get the guys behind 'Blade.'--While the first movie was magic versus magic, here we get the addition of technology (Tick-Tock and the Wheelers), but it's mostly anti-science and pro-myth in theme (Tick gets the C3PO treatment).  Also, economies are based on rocks (gold) so Murch hits on this theme of greed using the emeralds.Final Analysis = = Midrange Material "},{"Title":"Enchanting? Traumatising, more like !","Date":"3 May 2005","Score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Family, Fantasy","Review":" Return to Oz (1985)You can only imagine the look on the Disney execs faces when they saw the final cut of this film. Behind that colourful, cheerful Video/DVD cover or theatrical poster lies quite possibly one of the darkest films ever made intended for children. While I will always applaud filmmakers who dare to push the boundaries of the dark side to fairy tales and fantasy films in favour of sentiment and schmaltz, I have to say that this is pushing it.First time director Murch had made his name working as a film editor and pioneering sound designer in the 1970s with Coppolla and Lucas. Technically, this film is very good and only a few shots and effects betray the 1980s technology. The claymation of the Gnome king is particularly impressive, even today in the age of CGI. In most other aspects though, this film falls flat. First, unlike the original The Wizard of OZ there is not enough plot to sustain the momentum of this film's slightly longer running time. In the original film, there was actually a strong reason for Dorothy to stick together with her new friends, as each of them wanted to make the journey to the Emerald City to have their wishes granted. The first view of the run-down and crumbling Oz is a good idea. Here, though we have some half-baked plot about the Scarecrow being kidnapped by the Gnome king, which just can't sustain the narrative. There are other problems...First, there are two villains of which Mombi, the Witch, is arguably much more frightening than the main villain of the film, the Gnome King, despite her secondary (unnecessary?) role in the plot. Secondly, Dorothy's new friends just aren't likable and so any empathy for these characters is diminished. Part of the charm with the characters in the original was the clearly human features of each character, here we just have some annoying and grotesque mechanical objects - the affection Dorothy feels for them seems awkward and slightly mad. And an annoying talking chicken is no match for Toto, despite it's crucial, and completely contrived, importance in the finale! Finally, the balance between darkness and light, good and evil, is completely misjudged. This film has some truly scary moments in it from the beginning. Even in Kansas, Dorothy is strapped to a stretcher and narrowly avoids electro-shock therapy. The Wheelers are a very freaky creation indeed, though the impact of their initial threatening presence is undermined by their hysterical stupidity. And let's not get started on the corridor of female heads in Mombi's palace. There are also very minor details which don't quite sit right, such as the way the grotesque Pumpkinhead insists on calling the 10 year old Dorothy Mom which is somehow unsettling. The bright, colourful finale in the restored Emerald City and the rescuing of Ozma come too little, too late when compared with the dark and ugly events which precede. And who the heck is Ozma anyway - why should we care if we don't know? There are no signs of hope or optimism in the film, unlike the original good fairy, or dare I say it, those chirpy little songs! Throughout all this Fairuza Balk as Dorothy, while not the strongest child actor, is shown to be a strong character regardless of the horrors presented to her.I personally have never read Baum's original books and I gather from various reviews and Murch's own comments that the tone of Return to Oz is closer to them, than the 1939 Technicolour musical. While I half applaud Murch for daring to go with a dark feel, let's face it Fairy Tales have to be scary in places, there are very few, wonderful or magical moments to counterbalance the threatening and grotesque atmosphere. I director such as Tim Burton may have got the tone right, but Murch's inexperience shows. As a result we have an unattractive film that is as bizarre and surreal as many adult orientated horror / fantasy films. Older viewers will probably appreciate it more for these qualities, and there are some interesting interpretations to be made. Could the crumbling of Oz signify the death of the Golden Age of Hollywood studio cinema, of which the Wizard of Oz is a landmark. Younger viewers, however, are likely to be more traumatised than enchanted! 6/10 "},{"Title":"Diminishing Returns....","Date":"14 October 1999","Score":"6 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Family, Fantasy","Review":"  The main reason that Return to Oz did so badly is simple enough.People went in expecting another light-hearted, toe-tapping, bright and cheery trip down the yellow brick road.

Basically it has been six months since Dorothy Gale (introducing The Craft's Fairuza Balk) and her dog Toto were transported from Kansas to the magical land of Oz somewhere over the rainbow, and she cannot sleep thinking about it, and this is worrying Auntie Em (Piper Laurie) and Uncle Henry (Matt Clark). Since they are concerned for her, talking about imaginary places and people so much she is taken to a mental hospital for electro-shock treatment, but with another mysterious girl she manages to escape going down river in a chicken coup. After surviving some rough waters Dorothy wakes up in the land of Oz, and the chicken Billina (Mak Wilson, voiced by Denise Bryer) is talking, but the land has been destroyed, including the Yellow Brick Road, Munchkin City and the Emerald City, and she finds her friends the Cowardly Lion (John Alexander) and the Tin Man (Deep Roy) have turned to stone. Exploring the ruins she finds a clockwork mechanical man named Tik-Tok (Tim Rose and Michael Sundin, voiced by Sean Barrett), who tells her that the king of Oz, her friend the Scarecrow (Justin Case) has been captured by The Nome King (Nicol Williamson), who destroyed the land. Dorothy, Billina, Tik-Tok and new friends Jack Pumpkinhead (Stewart Larange, voiced by Brian Henson) and Gump (Stephen 'Steve' Norrington, voiced by Lyle Conway) are now on a journey to try and save the land and the people turned to stone. As they journey, avoiding the Deadly Desert and heading for the Nome King's mountain and domain, The Nome King himself, a rock creature, appears and explains that he kidnapped the Scarecrow as he stole emeralds from him to build the Emerald City. He has turned the Scarecrow into an ornament, and the Nome King, who has also taken the Ruby Slippers, gives each of them the opportunity to guess which of the hundreds in a room it is, Dorothy correctly guesses after spotting a green ornament. The Nome King in anger tries to eat the friends, and in panic Billina lays an egg which is thrown into the monster's mouth, eggs are poisonous to Nomes and he crumbles, the Ruby Slippers are returned, the land is restored and everyone turned to stone are freed. In the end the girl from the mental hospital appears, it is actually Princess Ozma (Emma Ridley), Jack's creator and the true ruler of Oz, Dorothy is sent home but is promised to return whenever she wishes, and she is asked to keep the existence of the magical land a secret. Also starring Jean Marsh as Nurse Wilson and Mombi the Witch, Sophie Ward as Mombi II and Fiona Victory as Mombi III. Balk is likable as the little and younger Dorothy, certainly not as memorable as Judy Garland but not bad, and the new characters introduced as her companions are sweet, I certainly see that this film has a darker side, and this is not a musical like previously, I agree the animation for faces in rocks and Claymation is impressive, this is easy to digest entertainment, a fun family fantasy film.

It's one of those children's films that's kind of too frightening for children. Compared to the 1939 film, it's a true nightmare. Those Wheeler guys, the witch who can exchange heads, and the Nome King are all intensely creepy (I guess the flying monkeys from the original are pretty freaky, too, but, even as a child, the Wicked Witch of the West looked like nothing more than a stern teacher to me). The story is very much the same structure from the original, with Dorothy (Fairuza Balk, who would later go on to co-star in films such as Almost Famous and American History X) collecting friends suspiciously similar to the first one while trying to discover what happened to the Emerald City and her friends (the Cowardly Lion and the Tin Man were turned to stone, but the Scarecrow is nowhere to be found). Despite the similarities between the two films, Return to Oz really succeeds in being a worthy sequel while completely differentiating itself from the original. It, too, has some beautiful production design and a gorgeous musical score (no songs, though), and as a fantasy movie, it's as good as anything else made in the '80s. I didn't appreciate it as a child, mostly because it was so different from the original, which I loved (and still love), but I can very much appreciate its wonder as an adult.

And though it seems to be for children, I think you'd be hard pressed to find any young adults that wouldn't find it appealing.Direction 8/10 (Walter Murch does a fantastic job on his first and only attempt as Director) Cinematography 8/10 (The sometimes creepy aesthetic is an appealing match for Murch's style) Editing 7/10 (A rushed project for Leslie Hodgson) Acting 8/10 (Lovely characters were handled with passionate performances) Dialogue 8/10 (Nicol Williamson's delivery, as the Nome King, is chillingly commanding) Sound 8/10 (A bit late on some obvious queues, but pretty good quality for the 80's) Effects 9/10 (The art of puppetry is dead, but this film is a reminder of its charms) Art Direction 8/10 (The team definitely gave this Oz a unique look and feel) Costumes 9/10 (Some fantastic likenesses to the original character designs from the books) Music and/or Score 9/10 (Very well suited enchanting music, especially in the final sequences)Total Score 82/100It's always nice to take a break from today's C.G infested films.

But, until this effort, Baum's source material was never returned to.The musical version has some dark moments this non-musical sequel is considerably darker throughout. There is some fabulous visual imagination,, some brilliant parallelling of real life with Oz (better than was done in the 1939 version), and some excellent performances, particularly from the young Fairuza Balk as an altogether grittier, if less melodious, Dorothy than Judy Garland. Jean Marsh is a chilling Mombi and Nicol Williams is a rather hammy Goblin King, albeit brought to the screen via some first rate clay animation.The music is also excellent - atmospheric, jolly at times, and eerie at other times.Well worth catching, and a worthy companion piece to its predecessor.

Baum's 'The Wizard of Oz' still remains a classic till this day, it is not and I repeat NOT an accurate interpretation of the Oz the real fans know. Scarecrows and lions do not burst into song every few minutes and a woman in green paint isn't considered 'wicked'.For those who don't know, it begins six months after the cyclone and Dorothy Gale is considered an insomniac. She can't sleep and can't stop thinking of Oz. After finding a key, her Aunt Em takes her to Dr. Worley's mental hospital across town where after a series of events she ends up tumbling into a river with a mysterious blonde girl who tells Dorothy that there are damaged patients in the cellars of the hospital and that Dorothy would soon end up like them.Drifting away via chicken coop, Dorothy is once again in the land of Oz which has been destroyed by the evil Nome King who has given the Emerald City to a powerful and terrifying princess, Mombi, who has the power to change her head at will! Disney's 'Return to Oz' (1985) is perhaps one of my most treasured and favourite films ever. I will never be able to shake off that beautiful image of Doroty running out of her house at the end and playing with Toto while that haunting, slightly reverberating score plays as the camera slowly zooms out; perfect ending.Before you even consider watching this thinking it will be a fun sequel of the Judy Gardland's 1930s classic, READ THESE COMMENTS. This is NOT a musical, there are NO munchkins and, in fact, the only similarity between this and the MGM musical is that Dorothy is a girl.As a child I watched this without being scared as some of the other members are. Sure, a few scenes such as the dark ones in the Hospital at the beginning as well as the infamous Hall of Heads in Mombi's palace are a little creepy but nothing a kid can't handle. I was too captured by the storyline, the great acting, beautiful and realistic scenery to be scared! And lastly, as I mentioned earlier, the music in this film is fantastic and perhaps one of my favourite film sound tracks ever. Gone are the cheesy, feel-good sing-along of We're off to see the Wizard!. There are no musical show-stoppers, just the perfection of the London Symphony Orchestra. The music in the beginning as Return to Oz pops up on the screen in it's emerald green colour really is haunting and sums this dark but exciting film up.Ridiculously underrated. Blows The Wizard of Oz and pretty much every children's films these days out of the water. A must see, Faruiza Balk IS Dorothy and this is Walter Murch's finest interpretations. I really do believe that the genius that is Frank L. Balm would have been pleased with this film.

Piper Laurie and Matt Clark are saddled with the somewhat thankless roles of Dorothy's relatives.While featuring splendid claymation effects by Will Vinton, this is somewhat macabre for a kiddie film &#150; with the witch storing a variety of living heads in a showcase (which she can exchange at will, though it's never explained for what reason); it's also dreary-looking, with the general tone being rather somber throughout (there are no cheerful songs to be heard here)!

Not only was it beneath Disney's standards but it, also, made hash out of the L. Frank Baum books. They saw fit to combine two OZ books namely The Marvelous Land of OZ and Ozma of Oz and did justice to neither.The characters of Mombi, Jack Pumpkinhead, the Gump and the Wheelers are found in the Marvelous Land of Oz. In this book Tip is the male protagonist. Mombi is an evil sorceress who indeed uses the Powder of Life to animate Jack. AS the book unfolds, it is revealed that Tip is actually Princess Ozma whose throne the Wonderful Wizard usurped transformed as a babe by Mombi.The character of Tik-Tok is first introduced in the book Ozma of OZ. Later, he is included in Tik-Tok of Oz which features, as well, the Nome King. I will let the readers of this review peruse those for themselves.Needless to say, the combining of the multiple stories is reflected in the final outcome. It does neither justice to L.

The story starts 6 months after the original movie's tornado in Kansas with Aunt Em having a devastated farm-house and Dorothy babbling about her time in Oz. Em sends her to a psychiatric hospital and as she's about to get shock treatment when the electricity goes out and Dorothy escapes with a friend's help and wakes up in Oz. Oz has been devastated as well with a broken up yellow brick road and an Emerald city that has turned into stone. What we find out is that a rock-like Gnome king has taken over the land with an evil princess and wheelers that kind of replace the flying monkeys as the enemies in the piece. Technically the movie has an interesting mix of claymation and costumes, but the real downside is that the movie is just not that entertaining which causes the viewer to lose interest about halfway thru. Fairuza is fine as Dorothy, but the supporting characters are just not that appealing. These include Tic-Toc(a mechanical man), Jack the pumpkin-headed man, a talking chicken named Malena, and a moose-head with a sofa attached that comes alive and flies everyone around. Jack has the most possibilities but we never really care for these characters that much. The movie is similar in that characters from Kansas have their counterparts in the land of Oz(which was done well), but I guess I understand why Disney didn't promote this movie that much after watching it. It is much less than what it could have been. It is an interesting addition to the Oz cannon at the most and that's about it. "},{"Title":"Just too many things wrong with this.

Who on earth conceived of the idea to have this successor Oz movie bear not the slightest resemblance to the 1939 film? Whether or not it was the sequel is not the point. The point is that it was the next one - and the next one is going to have to have some continuity with the first. This one didn't. At all.

Where Return to Oz played out a universe away and apart from the 1939 film, the musical Wicked intersects with it - but in a way that merely waves respectfully then moves on. Though Wicked considerably re-writes assumptions we may have had about Oz's celebs and VIPs, it doesn't interfere with the logic of our original assumptions. And so it is that Wicked can co-exist in the same plane as the 1939 film. Return to Oz is a total outlier - and an unentertaining one. Not a single redeeming virtue.

Even if it didn't follow the books as closely as possible, it still did a tremendous job of being funny and entertaining. With all this success, somebody HAS to think A second movie can only be second best. And if anybody thought that, they were probably right.First off, the movie is WAY dated. All the effects and everything are quite fake. Matte lines, slow motion, stop-motion effects... All here, all bad. Star Wars (not talking about Special Edition) had better effects than this, and it was made nearly ten years before this.Also, most of the stuff was also WAY off. The Wheelers speak for themselves, and Billina is somewhat of an annoyance. Jack Pumpkinhead's voice was...uh, odd, as was the way his head seemed to move depending on his emotion. And Tik-Tok, the Royal Army of Oz? I think NOT! Plus, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, the Cowardly Lion... oh, dear what happened? I know people will say that they look like the illustrations in the book, but, this is a SEQUEL TO THE WIZARD OF OZ! You'd think they'd at least try to make them resemble their 1939 counterparts! Other than that, the movie is OK. I mean, the sets, although they don't resemble the ones from The Wizard of Oz like they should, are great. The movie has a pleasantly dark feeling, mostly because of the Nome King's magic on the Ozians. Also, besides the problems mentioned above, the characters are fun to watch and sometimes funny. Tik-Tok is probably the best of the lot, aside from the annoying noise he makes when he walks.Overall, I recommend this OK movie only if you'd like to forget about the 1939 classic, or you're bored out of your mind.

Later Dorothy sees her friend Ozma in her bedroom mirror with her index finger in front of her mouth and Uncle Henry and Auntie Em forbidding her to talk of her Oz friends again and so she just decides to keep quiet from there and then plays outside so she's as a TV Guide review said,and in giving credit where it's due,portrayed as one cuckoo flying over the nest.While in the 1939 Classic this Dorothy both does and doesn't admit it was a dream upon her return/awakening.In this Movie They show that her house got blown away to Oz and never came back (along with their Hen,Belina)of which if it was a dream as seen in the '39 classic wouldn't have happened but when she awoke it was after the feeling of/that her house falling back from the sky after returning from Oz.While in this film they wouldn't have lost their old house and needed a new one if it was only a dream.of which in the '39 classic it was only a dream and they didn't loose their house.
