It doesn't help that Kevin Pollak, the actor with the most accomplished credits in the movie throws away the obviously golden mold of Sydney Pollack in Tootsie to allude to playing Jay Mohr in Jerry Maguire but settle for a pale imitation (to the extent such a thing is possible) of Geoffrey Tambor in the odious Life Stinks.  I gave this a 2 instead of a 1 because the title star does make a fairly attractive and physically convincing female athlete when he's not clowning around.  Of course, it only gets a 2 instead of a potential 5 or 6 because the film provides NO explanation of how he overnight became familiar enough with female impersonation techniques to pull such a good one off so quickly.  There are a few laughs in this unpretentious and undemanding brain-dead comedy, so if you are looking for background noise while you balance your checkbook or if you have yet to graduate 5th grade, you may find this acceptable.

In fact JUWANNA MANN is better than THE ENGLISH PATIENT, because in watching that film I was not concerned with what happened, was not engaged emotionally by the events in that story.  Ergo, JUWANNA MANN is a better film, at least to me, than THE ENGLISH PATIENT.  I'm not sure what to think about that, but it makes sense on some level.I caught this movie on cable one day, and figured it would be a painful retread of TOOTSIE, but after a while I couldn't turn it off.  It is about a pro-basketball player who crosses the line and is booted out of the league, his only recourse being to dress like a woman and play in the WNBA.  Not exactly high art.  However, the lead character, played by Miguel A. Nunez Jr., is so likable and honest I was amazed with his performance.  He puts on a wig and attacks the role with such gusto I couldn't help but take notice; there are also more subtle things that he does that help the film along. Nunez is the the lynch-pin holding the film together.  The supporting cast is also quite good  the always reliable Kevin Pollak, the lovely Vivica A. Fox, Tommy Davidson, etc.The film was also funny...I laughed which does not happen often, not because I am a humorless miser (entirely), but because most films don't strike me as amusing.  Don't get me wrong, JUWANNA MANN has it's share of crude humor and a scene involving a traffic stop that goes on too long, but it does not cripple the film, if adds nothing to it.  The damn movie is heartwarming, yeah, you heard me...heartwarming!  I've never used that term to describe a movie before, but it is.  The ending may be formulaic, but for some reason I forgave the film, perhaps because I wanted the characters to be happy.  It was certainly a great surprise to find a film at random, that I had never heard of before, and have it turn out to be a small gem.  It does not happen enough, but if other film makers would pay attention to a movie like JUWANNA MANN, there just might be a few more. 7/10.

A major problem of Juwanna Mann is that unwisely blended fantasy and reality lead the audience to an absurd confusion. If it took place in a perfectly fictitious setting, it could be more persuasive. But the setting obviously refers to the NBA and the WNBA in the real world, and even an average fan can tell what is described in the film is far different from the reality. Also, a moral-learning in coming-of-age manner of a pro star athlete with an arrested development seems forcedly contrived and looks unnatural. Finally, as an enthusiastic WNBA fan myself, I don't appreciate the filmmakers' lack of knowledge in and respect to women's sports.Overall, the film is all about the superb but raw idea, which is not executed well.

The very opening of the film finds the lead Jamal Jefferies being obnoxious (and completely unfunny throughout) in his on-court basketball antics. The untold money he is making as an athlete dries up as he gets kicked out of the league. Everyone turns their back on him - friends, his woman, even his agent. His lone hope is his aunt, in who's neighborhood he comes up with the idea to dress in drag and join the woman's league to keep some money coming in. He at first finds this league as hard to get along in as the one he came from, but slowly he acclimates and wins over his female teammates in the process. Here is where his growing love for Vivica Fox begins, which of course leads to the unavoidable reckoning of his NOT being a female to the woman of which he has grown fond.The movie offends at every turn. White female players on the team seem to have no skill, and those from foreign countries have hairy armpits. Jamal is stereotyped as the black athlete who spends every cent he has on clothes, cars, and parties, but hasn't anything left in the bank. Every single character seems to have no definition of who they are. The casting director has riddled the movie with more than a dozen B-list  barely recognizables (Tommy Davidson, Kim Wayans, Kevin Pollack, R&B artists Lil' Kim and Genuwine, NBA minor stars Vlade Divac and Dikembe Mutumbo, as if to equal the acting skill of just one notable star), each of which chime in for a couple total minutes of film at best. Each scene pushes along in uncomfortable transitions, dying to reach the director's need to fill 90 minutes (he even fudged here, clocking in at 87 - which in a sense was a bit of a relief). By the film's end, our hero has half-assedly atoned for his mistakes, and is inexplicably accepted back into the men's league to resume his career.This movie is a throw back to the 80's comedies that replayed ad naseum on Cinemax between the hours of 1130 pm and 4 am. With low-cost, independent comedies like My Big Fat Greek Wedding and Barbershop, unfunny drivel like this no longer should find room in movie theatres.

They said no woman can dunk in the WNBA, but Jamal does it at the championship game. 2.  Why didn't the woman's team have to forfeit their games considering they had a man on their team. 3.  Jamal Jeffries would not have been allowed back in the NBA considering he cheated teams over in the WNBA and not attending many meetings to attempt to go back in the NBA.  (END SPOILERS)  The movie is funny and Nunez surprised me with his acts of comedy.

But it looks to me like to be a remake of Tootsie. Tootsie is one of of my all time favorite movies. If this is a remake of Tootsie, I only hope if lives up to the original. Dustin Hoffman was the bomb in the original.

As stupid as it sounds to actually spend money on this movie, I was forced to do so by a friend. This person is no longer my friend. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There is nothing in this movie that is ever funny, the plot is insanely stupid and isn't thought out at all. It is so predictable and it is just no fun at all, plain and simple. Just look at it. It's about a man who is can't play basketball in the NBA so he plays in the WNBA. I mean, seriously, what the hell. If you really want to see a man dress as a woman, go watch Tootsie. I would have walked out of the theater, but I promise myself to watch every movie and give it a chance until the end. Please, if you ever consider watching this movie, just don't. You'll hate yourself for wasting your time like that. You would probably have more fun trying to kick yourself in the face. And you'll probably try that after seeing this giant piece of garbage. Stay away from this movie at all costs. A movie couldn't suck any harder than this. I couldn't possibly recommend this movie any less.

I wanted to give it a two out of ten simply because he was watching Sanford and Son at one point, but I just couldn't bring myself to give it any better than a one. Even if you just try to sit back and laugh, not analyze or look for plot holes, you won't be able to, it's just not funny. There were one or two things that were amusing (at best), but they were lost in all the unfunniness of the rest of the movie. Sometimes you sit there with an expectant smile on your face because you can see that a particular situation is going to have a funny conclusion, then the conclusion comes and they blow it, it's not funny and you are left disappointed. Eventually you learn to not expect anything good.This movie is an insult to the intelligence and integrity of the movie watching public. From the stupidest most immature movie watcher, to the most distinguished and intelligent, Juwanna Mann is an insult. It's that bad.  "},{"Title":"You Want Your Money Back?

It is so stupid, cliché and badly written that it's nearly impossible to sit through. Plus it has Lil Kim PLAYING A MODEL!! That's enough even for me. I mean I can sit through a bad movie if it has something (anything!) in it. I even survived The Island of The Dead (which was so bad that it was actually funny at times). But this is just bad and it isn't funny though it's a comedy! That should be punishable The horror, the horror...PS. I can't understand what Vivica Fox is doing here? She seems to be taking every role they give her. "}]
