I thought, oh, cute movie about a guy and girl who play basketball and get together.  Not exactly earth-shattering, I thought, but cute.  So imagine my surprise when I saw the film start like a cute movie but then evolve.  And deepen.  And bloom.  I laughed, I sat on the edge of my seat in anticipation, and I swear I almost cried.  A cute movie?  This film had levels I hadn't dreamed of and spoke to so much more than just sex and basketball, and yet all of it was held together cohesively by the love affair and the commitment to the sport.  I was thoroughly impressed by the performances all around and by Ms. Prince-Blythewood's unerring writing and direction.  A definite recommendation.

Now perhaps because of this, you'd think I'd enjoy movies easier whose central theme revolves around a sport.  Contrary to that notion though, I am often a hard rater of sports movies because I expect so much from them.I really enjoyed this movie though.  I thought the acting by both Lathan and Epps was outstanding.  I found it to be extremely realistic, with the exception of seeing Epps in a Laker uniform, but other than that, it was real.  At one point during the film, I really started to wonder if this film was based on a true story or something, how cool would that have been. Nonetheless, the fictional story is captivating.Yes I am a guy and I love sports, but I do like watching the occassional love story.  I liked Pearl Harbor and Titantic which revolved around love stories, and I liked this love story too.  There is more to it though, than just two people who fall for each other who happen to play basketball.There is the relationship not only between Quincy and Monica, but the relationships they had with their father and mother respectively.  There is also the relationship they have with the world they live in, trying to find out what they really want in life.  It really makes you think about how sometimes the very thing you are looking for is actually standing right there in front of you and you don't realize it.In the end, I loved Love and Basketball, and I give it a 10.

I am definitely more of a movie fan than a basketball fan, thus I went in expecting a jock flick with a token relationship thrown in to justify the title.  I could not have been more wrong.  Unlike He Got Game (another very good film), which dwells solely on the negative aspects of the sport - hustlers, hookers, drugs and death, L&B concentrates on the positive things in life and basketball serves as the background rather than the focus.  The story is very well written and works on several levels - it refuses to be pinned down as simply a romance or drama, choosing instead a careful blending of different elements.  My only complaint - minor at that - would have to be the ending (and no I'm not going to tell you).First, how could I find fault with a film that actually does a great casting job with Tyra Banks?  She has a small cameo role- she plays a beautiful stewardess, small stretch - with some great lines. Omar Epps brings his trademark cockiness to the role, and although it took me awhile to buy him as a basketball player -he's not exactly Goliath -he grows on you.  More importantly, he exhibits and a depth and range that he's never shown before. Sanaa Lathan however, goes one step further, and demonstrates an intensity both on and off the court that puts her in a league all her own.  Her performance can be summed up as superb. L&B is real, engaging, and enjoyable.  Don't miss it.

It's in effect a tribute to Title IX and the WBNA, casually showing a girl with basketball dreams, and how it affects her personal life and those around her. Highly recommended for teens! As good as Omar Epps was though, I thought he was a bit short to be believable as an NBA prospect.Except for one talky section of the movie towards the end where everyone pretty much says the obvious about their relationships, the rest of the character development is done visually and through situations and not one sports movie (or African-American) clich√©. It is a date movie because both leads change. Stay through the credits to see a sweet shot at the end.I was girding for a hip hop soundtrack, but it's old school R & B all the way and lovely to listen to (complete with a wonderful line that the audience really appreciated Mom, why are you drinking?

Even with football enveloping all which had entwined their lives, the humaneness of those two characters could not be discounted, especially with Babs emerging into a more stronger character who came into her own as a woman and an individual toward the film's end.I bring that up to start my assessment of Love and Basketball.  Yes, there were differences, of course, with Quincy (Omar Epps, of whose work I have been a fan of since Juice in 1992) and Monica (Sanaa Lathan, who has seemingly come from nowhere to emerge as a serious talent to be reckoned with on the screen!) both being African-American.  And instead of football, the sport was basketball.  And instead of one athlete, there were two, as Monica was a superior talent on par with Gavin Gray and Quincy McCall.  And the story, of course, was set more in the recent past, from 1981 to the present.  Nonethelss, this was also a film which touched my heart.  I loved the depth which both actors in this film displayed, showing them not only as athletes and people, but also as they were with regard to their families as well.  And the depths from where they came to where they ultimately went, from their beginnings as children to the adults they grew up into, was nothing short of amazing.  I saw this not as a black movie, but rather as a movie about African-Americans and their dreams, desires, pains and triumphs as individuals and as a couple.  The way this was broken down into four quarters is a testament to Gina Prince-RockByTheWood's astute writing and directing.  And the supporting cast was on-mark also, from Alfre Woodard and Debbi Morgan on through to Dennis Haysbert and Harry J. Lennix...as well as Tyra Banks in her smaller yet significant role as the film bore on down the stretch.  All-in-all, a film definitely worth the see. I came away with a warm smile not only on my face, but in my heart as well.

I kept waiting for her to punch out those idiot female high school classmates of hers who kept picking on her because she was a tomboy.  There was a nice contrast between Monica's independence and the traditional homemaker route that her mother took.  The subplot about the troubled marriage of Quincy's parents was also well done.  I have seen other basketball movies (Above The Rim and He Got Game comes to mind), but this is one of the better ones, esp. since it tells the story from the viewpoint of the female athlete, and an African-American one, at that.  I wholeheartedly recommend this.  It's free of the fluff that permeates other romantic dramas.

Eyes glued to the T.V.I love how the families even though there were bad times, they were always there for the their children. These days if a young person announced that she was pregnant, she would be thrown out the house.There was even a part that linked to having sex for the first time. I feel that is how it should be taking it slow and not just rushing into something because he says your cute or if you love me have sex with me.The soundtrack of the movie was dominating and kept up with the story plot.

So imagine how happy I was when I rented this movie (it had been advertised as a sports movie in some ads and a chick flick in others) and found gold.I won't give away anything about this surprisingly underrated film as I didn't know too much about it going in (as I've said many times before, that's often the best way to watch a movie).  I'll just say that I'd be very happy to see more sports movies made in the mold of this one.  Every cliche from the genera is tossed from the very beginning, and there isn't even a Big Game at the finale.  (Well, not exactly.  There *is* a climactic game, but and you'll understand when you watch it there is a LOT more at stake than the state championship or whatever.)A little warning for the parents, as I'm a responsible gremlin.  This movie's rated PG-13, and for a while I thought it was just for language and that this movie would be perfectly fine for thoughtful preteens.  Little change of pace from the Mighty Ducks tripe.  Well, it turns out that about halfway through there is a very *HOT* scene, so it really should have been rated R.Then again, if Scary Movie can sneak by with an R and not a triple-X these days... but I digress.

The actress (Lathan?) who played the part of the female lead was excellent.The movie feels like it runs a bit slow in spots, but I think it's simply because it covers years of the character's lives. Some scenes are going to be better than others obviously, so don't dismiss the movie, if like me, you don't care for every scene.I was much more interested in the life story of the female lead, and what she did with her basketball talent than the love story. I think partly that's due to the love story being fragmented. Which is, again, a result of covering years in a movie - the script writer has to pick and choose what events are most important.A few of the supporting roles I did not care for as much. Her mom's character's personality made no sense to me. She seemed to take no pride whatsoever in her daughter's sports career, yet was a loving mom - to me, that was too much of a dichotomy. The male leads father never made sense to me either.I think most people could enjoy this movie for the solid acting involved, and it's certainly better than 90% of the junk movies I have seen lately while unemployed (I watch a lot of movies )) "},{"Title":"Amazing Movie !!!","Date":"25 November 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Sport","Review":" Love & Basketball directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood, released in 2000 by 40 Acres & A Mule Filmworks, is a romance film that follows the love story of Monica Wright (Sanaa Lathan) and Quincy McCall (Omar Epps) and offers and emotional and sensual experience. Throughout the film, you feel the reality and intensity as a viewer. Although this film does not fit the usual fast-paced action, excitement, and adventure stereotype of this analytical approach, it can still be used because you can feel the intensity of Monica and Quincy's love throughout the whole movie. The diegesis of the film seems like a reality, and makes you forget that you're watching a film.One question raised by this analytical approach is How powerful or intense is the film as an emotional or sensual experience? The answer is very powerful. This film follows Monica and Quincy from the time they are 11 until they eventually get married. The ups and downs of their relationship, such as their first time doing it or when Monica suspected Quincy of cheating, are shown throughout the film. At any point in the film, you can feel the emotions of any actor as if it was happening to you. The film seems like a reality while you're watching it.Another two questions raised are Where in the film are we completely wrapped up and involved in it's reality? Where is the film weakest in emotional and sensual intensity? One example of when we are completely wrapped up in it's reality is during the first game we see Monica playing during her high school career. You feel the intensity as the clock is ticking. You can hear Monica talking to herself in her head. You see what she sees. One example of where the film is weakest in intensity is while they're at the dance. Since Monica isn't too fond of her date, you don't really get any emotional intensity.The final question raised is What role does each of the film elements play in creating a hard-hitting emotional and sensual response? There are many shot reverse shots in this film. They add to the hard-hitting emotional and sensual response by showing each actor's emotions. The fact that you can see how each actor reacts to other actors increases the emotional and sensual response that each viewer gets. In conclusion, Love & Basketball, is a film that delivers both an emotional and sensual experience. Each part of the film adds something else to it. Watching this film engulfs you in the whole diegesis. Its a film that you WON'T get tired of watching. I would definitely recommend that EVERYONE watch it. ) "},{"Title":"One Line Summary","Date":"14 March 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Sport","Review":" In 1981, Monica moves in next door to Quincy.

They are consistently being completive however when Quincy's parents argue, Monica is the first to let him so he can sleep on the floor. They finally realize at the end of their high school career they really have feelings for each other and become a couple. They both sign with the college of USC and continue to date throughout college until, Quincy's relationship with his father takes a turn for the worse and cost the relationship to end as well. After college, Monica goes over seas to play WNBA basketball; she doesn't stay there long because she has such strong feelings for Quincy. Monica comes home to find that Quincy is about to get married; so she offers him a game one on one for his heart. He agrees and they end up falling in love again and continue their life together. Again a favorite quote of mine nothin' but net, meaning they made their life together just as three point shot with only four seconds left in the game. Monica only had one day to get Quincy's heart back and she succeeded just like all the basketball games she won. Nothing BUT NET! The theme of this movie is Love and Basketball. I believe it is through tough love they develop a relationship and both develop a passion for basketball. The actors of the movie are starring Sanaa Lathan, Omar Epps, Alfre Woodard, Dennis Haysbert, Debbi Morgan, Harry J. Lennix, Gabrielle Union, Kyla Pratt (Monica), Glenndon Chatman (Quincy), Monica Calhoun (Lena Wright), Tyra Banks (Karen). The writer and director of the movie is Gina Prince. Monica is the young girl who moves by Quincy in the beginning of the movie and develops a relationship with also a main character throughout the entire movie. Quincy is the young boy who begins a relationship with Monica; Quincy is a main character throughout the entire movie. They are the important characters of the movie however Monica's Dad and Mom are in a couple of scenes and Quincy's parents as well.

The soundtrack to it was awesome! It was effective and appropriate. The songs fit the movie perfectly and actually complimented it. Since the movie was told through the 80's and 90's the music fit the time appropriately. It wasn't music from the 70's or the 50's but music that was within the time line. However, Al Green's LOVE AND HAPPINESS which open the beginning scene was a nice touch even though it wasn't directly from the given time period.The genre of the music was effective also. Love and Basketball is a predominately black film, directed by the one and only John Singleton, the music fit that standard. It wasn't Rock or Country Western that would most certainly ruin the movie, but it was a mixture of R&B and Rap music that they played. It was songs that many of the viewers and audience has heard before. That would send them back to their own memories of that time. Even the ones that may not remember it was music that they could dance to.The sound track as any other is to compliment the movie. Which the Love and Basketball sound track did just that.

Watching L&B again after 3+ years, I was reminded of why I absolutely fell in LOVE with it in the first place. So many things that Monica and Q experienced in each Quarter of the movie brought back memories of my own high school and college experiences. In many ways, L&B was a coming-of-age movie for me. (Not to mention that the soundtrack is a fabulous trip down musical memory-lane). L&B is a poignant and touching modern story love story that follows the evolving lives and love of two young African-American athletes, as they navigate through the complications and changes thrown at them as they mature into adulthood. Sanaa Lathan is a standout in this movie. As always, with consummate ease, she infuses humanness and sincerity in to every character she plays. The on-screen chemistry between Sanaa and Omar is so perfect it just tugs at your heartstrings. It turns out they were a real-life couple around the time the movie was filmed/released, but real-life romance does not always guarantee on-screen chemistry (just look at Eyes Wide Shut with Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise). Fortunately, Sanaa and Omar's real-life chemistry came across wonderfully on screen. I think that the first love scene between Monica and Q is one of the most beautiful, touching, and tastefully done scenes of its kind in film. I NEVER cry at movies, and I was a little misty-eyed at the end--not typical for a love scene. Also, the second-to-last scene where Monica and Q play basketball one-on-one for Q's heart--accompanied by a spot-on track by Meshell Ndegeocello--brought a tear or two to my eyes. L&B is a classic love story, but it deftly manages to avoid triteness or unoriginality by giving the viewer subtle glimpses into several of life's realities as they impact Monica and Q. The marked disparity in opportunities for male and female athletes underscores the entire movie, and we get an inside look as Monica invests sweat and tears pursuing her dream. We also see the sacrifices and strength of both Monica and some of the supporting female characters in the movie, such as Monica and Q's mothers, and Monica's teammates. I loved the ending of this movie as well. By giving the audience a positive glimpse into the future, L&B delivered the happy ending that we've come to expect from romantic movies, without being corny, overly-sappy or unrealistic. L&B is a wonderful (under-recognized), timeless love story that will touch athletes and non-athletes like, and it is a must for any movie collection.

This really touched me&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;I know that a great terror of my own was the prospect that my dad had cheated on my mom; that would be such a betrayal. It was interesting to look at it as a study of how violence and loss can seep into our personalities, at least in the personalities in the movies. Sometimes the character's comebacks when they were fighting each other were more poetic. This film was anything but predictable, and it really kept moving. So when his world turns upside down, he's so lost. I won't go into the story much more than that because that would be giving too much away. I'll just say that this movie took many delightful turns.

Set in Los Angeles, circa 1988, two college-bound basketball players have given their all for the sport through their years at high school. Now, in their senior year, they both strive to attain a scholarship so they can further excel in their finesse. What had first been a casual relationship between the two high schoolers eventually intensifies into a romantic bond that soon awakens them to the fact that, in any relationship, you have to prioritize your time between the one you love and the thing you love doing. The deeper, dramatic content of the story arises from the personal trials that the two leads are faced with as they move on to college, how the trials affect their performances on the court, and the difficulties that results in their separation. Gina takes us through a more deeply woven story than I had anticipated, as we follow the characters to their early peeks of adulthood. At which point, they realize the reality of their undying love for each other, and, for that matter, their rekindled love for the sport that drew them together.

Dreaming myself of playing in the WNBA not only does it inspire me, but he has a great love story behind it. Love and Basketball can have two meanings to it. The love for the game, and the love for a guy or girl. They have to decide which is more important, and how to keep both of them in their life. Throughout the movie, this couple is juggling between the two. While one will find a good relationship more important the other will find basketball more important, then it will switch. Finally in the end both couples realize that the love each other will help them go further in basketball and they still maintain both. In a way it can have a lot to do with real life, you have to figure out what is most important in your life. Monica in the movie proved herself as a basketball player. With her parents not believing in her she pushed on and ended up playing pro. With her love for the game and her love for 'her man' she made it that far. I love this movie, and if your a basketball fan then I suggest it to you "},{"Title":"I Love This Movie...  Best Movie of All Time","Date":"30 October 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Sport","Review":" This movie is just great. I love basketball, and when I saw this movie I thought that I could definitely relate to it. Movies often portray their characters as completely out of the ordinary. To make it worth seeing, of course they both had to be dedicated and real to their sport and to every other aspect of their life. I love how they show that Quincy indulges in his talent-given magnetism when it comes to girls and other people, whereas Monica shames away from anything having to do with dating and dressing up, as well as social situations because as is mostly consistent with what I'm guessing is a majority of high schools female basketball players in this time and setting are not typically embraced. She has an attitude, which is very typical out there on that court. It's a girlfight. I'm guessing that non-basketball players aren't going to like this movie as much, because it's a possibility that they can't relate to a lot of what it's all about, and what the characters are struggling with. The plot isn't completely tied together but at the same time, it's cohesive with life which is what makes it great. Life isn't about a plot. It's about figuring things out and living your life with whatever you have. It's about striving for your goals. If you're a film critic who hasn't played basketball, I'm recommending that you don't try to critique it because to you it might be about the plot. Chances are that other people are just going to go ahead loving the movie anyway. ) "},{"Title":"Love and Basketball","Date":"16 October 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Sport","Review":" by Jashayla CummingsMy favorite movie is Love and Basketball. This movie is about a girl named Monica and a boy named Quincy who have been friends since they were children. Monica and Quincy both share the love for basketball. As Monica and Quincy become older, Quincy tries to tell Monica that basketball is not everything and that she should move on in life.This is a story of love and basketball. My favorite movie actress, Omar Epps, stars in this movie.I like the movie Love and Basketball because it has both romance, drama, determination, love, and humor. The most romantic scene in the movie is when Quincy and Monica were hugged up on the ground in the front of the college they both attended. They both were telling one another how much they love and care about each other.The most dramatic parts of the movie occur throughout the entire movie, as Monica tries to win Quincy's heart. Monica's determination is strong throughout the movie as she proclaims that she's going to be the first woman in the NBA. The love in Love and Basketball portrays two childhood friends, Monica and Quincy, who are soon to become soul mates and lovers.Since Monica loves basketball so much, Quincy thought up a joke about Monica while they both were riding in Quincy's car after his basketball game. He said,Monica, so who are you going to the dance with? Spalding? Who's Spalding?, Monica asked. Quincy pointed at the basketball that Monica was holding in her lap. Then Monica frowned at Quincy and punched him on his shoulder because he was being silly and making jokes about her.Love and Basketball is the greatest movie ever because it is thrilling, romantic, and a tearjerker. This movie is all about matters of the heart and how a person has love for a game but also shares the love of that game with her lover.

Which would you put your hard-earned savings on? What would be the odds? These are all some tough questions that I had hoped would be answered while watching the drama Love & Basketball. At first I thought this was going to be a versus film, but instead it turned out to be a comparison piece. Love & Basketball did something that most sports films only dream of accomplishing, creating a strong connection between the emotion on the court and the emotions of life. Sadly, this is the only element that it successfully accomplished, as most of it was more a dribble of clich√©s coupled by some poorly performed dunks. The acting was decent, perhaps a bit too accentuated for the surroundings, but it was the characters that just seemed oddly mismatched. I felt as if I was watching and trying to get excited for a High School Junior Varsity game, when I honestly should have been focusing on a stronger, more defined team. There was some meat to this film, but you had to eat around the gristle to get there, and that wasn't enjoyable in the least. Love & Basketball was fun to watch, but didn't quite create that spark that was needed to electrify the court.Let's begin with Spike Lee. Now, I don't like to name drop in these reviews, but I am a big fan of Lee's work. I believe his films are some of the most underrated films in Hollywood. He is hard hitting, in your face, and extremely rough, but for me it works. I have not been disappointed with any of his work. I am however, disappointed with his involvement in this film. With Lee involved as a producer, I was expecting a much grittier portrayal of this basketball love. I wanted to see a better-defined connection between the two themes, but instead what I was handed was a chaotic bowl of spaghetti, with moments interweaving with other, non-connective moments. It was devastating to watch. Needless to say, Lee should have put his chops more into this film. It could have been dark, it could have been honest, but instead we were left with a sea of fouls, bad dribbles, and tons of air balls.The acting could have been stronger. I will agree that Omar Epps is a very talented player in Hollywood, but I do not think that he had a full understanding of this character. There were moments in Love & Basketball where I could see greatness emerging from Epps, sadly there were more scenes that just felt like they should be flushed with the rest of the garbage. Monica, aka Sanaa Lathan, could have been a stronger feminine voice. It was encouraging to see someone strive for their dreams, to see the counter-balance of how the world of basketball treats males and females differently, but she just wasn't strong enough. She balanced too much on Quincy (Epps) and ultimately it created a shallow character. Secondly, both of these characters came from wealthy homes. I don't know if you noticed, but both houses were beautiful and very upper class &#133; so where did that gangsta attitude come from? I didn't feel like it matched their characters well at all. I felt that it was used because director Gina Prince-Bythewood was trying to reach out towards a different audience than what should have been attempted. It was these types of inconsistencies that hurt this film. It wasn't just in the characters, but also in the story.There are huge scenes that were supposed to be very emotional and very triumphant that just floundered in this film because they were either 1) rushed or 2) never developed. This hurt, because by the time this film is nearing its completion, no matter how bad you think it is so far, you do feel a connection with these characters. You do want to see some resolution, and for that I can only applaud everyone's work. Unlike in some Hollywood films, you do feel connection to these two hearts. You feel compassion and devotion to their dreams and downfalls, but intermixed are these massive scenes of confusion. For example, near the end of the film, Monica and her mother have a very emotional talk. If this entire scene didn't arrive right out of mid air, than perhaps I would have been more excited about the tender moment, but it just seemed like Alfre Woodard needed a moment to demonstrate her acting chops. There wasn't enough development between Monica and her father, a key element that I believe should have been explored deeper. He understood her dreams, yet did nothing to support them. It seemed like it was a walking double negative that desperately needed more filling. Finally, where did the sister go midway through the film? We took all this time to develop the family, yet just as quickly as they go to college, we ignore them. Gina Prince-Bythewood had too much happening and didn't know how to handle the pressures.Overall, I will float down the center of the court for this film. Love & Basketball tried hard to develop this beautiful love relationship derived from the sport of basketball, but sadly, there were too many unneeded players on the court. The father side-story was worthless, as was all scenes dealing with Monica's family. The overall story was decent, but using the power of Spike Lee, there should have been more grit, more dirt, less plastic Hollywood. Was the director worried about going to far with this film? In my opinion, she should have reached for the sky and transformed this film into this emotional powerhouse. Instead, for some strange reason, I felt as if I was watching a sappy version of Bring It On. Is that bad of me?

Sinaa Lathan plays Monica, a basketball player aspiring to be the first female baller of the NBA. Her father is a banker, her mother a strong stay-at-home mom, and she has one sister, Lena.

They each love the game and as time goes on they realize how much they love each other and what they will do to remain committed to the game and their bond.I don't really have all the words to describe the movie, but you'll have familiar flashbacks of the 80's with clips of video games, a few fashion trends, and TV shows.

But I knew that what they showed on television wasn't the real thing, so I went and downloaded online and it was even better.The thing about this movie is that this love has been going on since the two characters were 11, and the girl, Monica, she always knew that, Quincy on the other had didn't realize that until their high school spring dance. When Monica came to the dance with somebody else and Quincy got jealous. Another good thing about this movie is that it some of the dialogues they actually emphasize that its been a certain number of years since this and that happen. For example it says in the text (i.e.) I can't believe it's been five years, they emphasize the years.I've seen other movies and its like two people who have known each other since kindergarten, fall in love their senior year, start dating, get engaged, get married, and the girl dies, and its all within a 6 month time period. That's too fast. But Love and Basketball isn't like that, everything happens when it is suppose to happen, and besides the movie got really good reviews.Not to mention the chemistry that was between Omar Epps and Sanaa Lathan was unbelievable. It was like when you were listening to their conversations that they had in the movie, and how deep they are, its like you're feeling everything they're saying and its like your experiencing everything they're saying, that's how deep it was.

It may have a note of corniness during some scenes, but that doesn't stop it from being one of the best sleeper hits of 2000. The film's drama is great and the romance has brilliant chemistry and all the elements stick nicely together thanks to the acting &#150; particularly from amazing newcomer Sanaa Lathan &#150; and Gina Price's clean direction. The scenes I thought were particularly nail biting were the basketball matches between the two lead characters, the final one-on-one is tense and unpredictable. Also seeing Monica's (Lathan) thoughts when playing basketball was clever and original. All the characters have a good bad side them, you relate to them, which make these similar but totally different (you'll understand after viewing) creations the best about the film. Come to think of it, this movie shouldn't have the title Love & Basketball. It should have the title Love, Basketball, Family, Gender Roles, Sex, Cheating&#133; and so forth and so forth.

"}{"Title":"Understated Romance","Date":"5 December 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Sport","Review":" Initially renting this movie, I thought I would be in store for something along the lines of Love Jones, a solid film in its own right, but hardly a masterpiece. I was pleasantly surprised to have my expectations gradually peeled away and become engrossed in a beautifully nuanced love story.The story starts out conventionally enough, when two 11-year olds become neighbors; the girl is Monica, a reticent tomboy who loves playing basketball with the guys. The boy is Quincy, or Q who, you guessed it--loves playing basketball--but whose motivation for exceeding at the game becomes questionable later in the story.Basically, we follow these two characters longitudinally through the movie, discovering how their lives intersect and how their mutual expectations are sometimes fulfilled, sometimes not. This may sound vague, but synopses are not always necessary for critique; one of the pleasures of good cinema is the novelty of it, the ability to be surprised. That said, this is not a plot-driven movie; there are no shocking twists or turns. Rather, it is a powerful character study interlaced with a gentle romance.Most of the power comes from one of cinema's shining neophytes, Sanaa Lathan. I was mesmerized as I watched a seemingly one-dimensional characterization unfold into a multi-layered, complex portrayal of a sensitive yet driven woman. Vulnerable but not a victim, motivated and assertive yet not overbearing, I didn't even realize the blossoming I was privy to until well after the film had ended--this is how subtly engaging Lathan's performance is. Monica IS the emotional core of this film; moreover, economy in acting seems sparse these days--it is far easier for a performer to get their message across by over-emoting and flashy theatrics, than to convey feeling through facial expressions, body language and other 'unspoken' variables.So, in the aforementioned sense, Love and Basketball is Lathan's movie. Monica's chemistry with Omar Epps' Q is palpable, and Epps himself delivers an adept portrayal of a young man in conflict with his family, his sport and himself. I would like to have seen a more detailed account of Q's familial and emotional life, yet then it may have detracted from Sanaa Lathan's fleshy, sentient fulfillment of her craft.Of course the film would not have materialized if it wasn't for Gina Prince-Blythewood's perceptive script and unflinchingly honest direction. I look forward to ALL the principal players' future work.See it "},{"Title":"A three-pointer!","Date":"13 November 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Sport","Review":"  Love and basketball is a damn good movie!

The film is well directed, well written and well acted, but anyone looking for a sports movie is going to be disappointed.  Basketball is mostly used as a MacGuffin to get the two protagonists together.At age ten they meet as next door neighbors in an affluent L.A. suburb.  Quincy's dad is a player for the Clippers.  Monica's dad is a banker and her mother (Alfre Woodard) is a '50's sitcom type housewife (or would be if she were white).  Quincy and Monica have a game of horse, and Quincy--enraged at losing to a girl--pushes Monica down and gives her a life-long scar on her face.  As they get older, they become buddies and we see their turbulent home lives.  Quincy's dad stays out late for business meetings and Monica remains a tomboy to spite her mother.  At the senior dance they come to realize they are in love.After they both decide to go to USC, you would think the focus would turn more towards the game, but you would be wrong.  Although there are scenes of them training and subplots involving intra-squad rivalries, the focus remains on the relationship.Unfortunately, by spending all the time on the relationship, the film gives short shrift the the parts of the involving them as athletes, which are just as--if not more--compelling.  We do see some of the pressures of big time college and professional basketball, but much more is left out.  We see that NBA marriages are constantly jeopardized by groupies, but we don't see the fact that they are also constantly jeopardized by long separations when the team is out on the road.  We see women's basketball is forever and unjustly overshadowed by the men's game, but we don't see some of the prejudices that keep it that way and the effects those prejudices have on the women who play (i.e. the pressure to appear straight or at least not too butch).This is not a bad film, particularly as a date film, but by overlooking the athletic part of the story, the filmmakers have made an errant pass.  7 out of 10.And was I the only one who was unimpressed by Tyra Banks (her acting, that is)?

She is thoroughly believable in this movie. She gets the man,  career, and life she wanted. How often do we see our black women get it all in the movies.Clearly the movie is told from her point of view, but there are some outstanding performances that compliment Lathan's. Omar Epps is steady and credible as Quincy. I wonder however, how many more sports movies he has left in him? He's been a footbal player (The Program), baseball player(Major league II), and now a basketball player. All and all, he shines  in this movie. The supporting cast of Dennis haysbert, Alfre Woodard, Angie Morgan, and Harry Lennix round out the exceptional supporting cast.Gina Prince has shown herself to be a very sound and capable director. It's not often that stories with an all african-american cast  are not centered around some cliche or another.

The New York Knicks are once again in the thick of the title hunt, and Spike Lee, Knick fan No. 1, can be found on the sideline, cheering on his team. Lee has become famous not only for his skills as a film director (Do the Right Thing), but also for his basketball passion (1998's He Got Game), and prominent role on the sideline. So it doesn't come as a surprise that Lee co-produced the new basketball film, Love & Basketball.The movie tells the story of Quincy McCall (Omar Epps), son of an NBA player, and Monica Wright (Sanaa Lathan). In the first quarter, they meet as kids who become new neighbors. To Quincy's amazement, she can play ball better than most boys, which leads them to a competitive bet on who will turn professional first. The second quarter takes the friends to high school, where Monica gains the reputation of a tomboy who can't get a date for the seniors' dance, while Q has his choice of friends (and girls), but displays somewhat poor taste. He changes his mind about Monica when they move on to the third quarter, college life. Their relationship, rooted in their love for the game, prospers as their skills improve. Soon, they have to start choosing between the love for their game and for each other. Quincy's troubles on the home front further complicate things, and eventually, they both move on and try to carve out a living at the pro level. Their fourth quarters lead them to different parts of the world, before they meet each other again. Now they face a decision that determines the outcome of this Love & Basketball game.Instead of directing the movie himself, Spike Lee helped to develop young talent black director Gina Prince-Bythewood responded with an admirable debut. She managed to create an engaging and honest film about the relationship, development, and challenges of a young black couple. The cast also rises to the same level, most of all with the lead performances of Omar Epps and Sanaa Lathan. They both deliver good games and manage to feed off each other both on and off the court. Especially Sanaa Lathan seems a rising star who will certainly be seen and heard more of in her cinematic future. Maybe what makes the movie most credible The shooting locations. Real-life powerhouse Crenshaw High in Los Angeles was used as the high school, and close-by Southern Cal, a prominent basketball program, was a perfect fit for the college quarter of the movie. Even the woman's basketball league, WNBA, and the NBA agreed to lend their names to the movie. Interestingly, a college assistant coach from local rival UCLA was hired as a basketball advisor and coach. A segment of the film was even shot in Barcelona, Spain, all contributing to Love & Basketball being a successful successor of He Got Game with an added feminist twist.Unfortunately, the real-life image doesn't exclude one of the more negative aspects of basketball that didn't really have anything to do in this movie. Both in the locker room and during the romantic scenes, Monica's Nike sports bra gets considerably more screen time than even Brandi Chastaine's at last summer's Soccer World Cup. The small Nike symbol is placed subtly but noticeably throughout the movie, raising the question if the sports company sponsored the film budget to gain a small advantage in the hard-fought basketball (sneaker) market. On another downside, the plot of Love & Basketball remains rather predictable The audience knows the outcome far ahead of the buzzer.However, as basketball fans know, even games that fail to deliver the upset win, or that are not decided at the buzzer, can be a lot of fun to watch.

I must say that Omar seems to get noticeably better in each film. Without a doubt he is a talented young actor whom I like a lot. In Love and Basketball Omar brings to life the character Quincy McCall.This film is also just as much about Monica Wright(Sanaa Lathan) as it is about Quincy, I feel the characters they portray succeed because of excellent directing (Gina Prince) and obvious camaraderie between the two (Monica and Quincy).Although the movie is centered around basketball, that's really not what the movie is all about. Many social issues are brushed upon throughout the movie. I could mention several of these social themes easily, some of note; trust between father and son, broken mother daughter relationships,stereotypes of female athlete's, infidelity in marriage, I could go on and on.What really takes this movie over the top though is the bond between Quincy and Monica that stems all the way back to childhood. The movie starts off with Monica and Quincy at 11 years of age and amazingly the special bond seemed to exist between them then too. Although Quincy comes within 2 weeks of marrying his Fiance(played by Tyra Banks) it is obvious the Quincy and Monica were simply meant for each other. Quincy and Monica's relationship teaches us the importance of couples being there for one another no matter what obstacle.Quincy and Monica have almost a fairy tale relationship but experience the usual woes that plague young couples. Director Gina Prince does an outstanding job of conveying the plight of the two young stars. Not to be taken for granted is the great acting job done in this movie by Monica, she compliments Quincy in this movie very well.

The basketball sequences are convincing, as is Sanaa Lathan as Monica Wright. There is light humor throughout, always appropriate and never silly. Although the performances and dialogue could have been a little more convincing, this is an important film; not only giving us a look at the life of women athletes, but also in showing that a woman's commitment to sport is just as valid and can be just as strong as that of a man's.

Omar Epps, Sanaa Latham, and other cast members are to be commended for being selective in roles that they choose.  There were no negative images of us in this movie.  Instead, real images were presented and we were human beings. However, the story line had little depth.  It was the story of  a boy and girl who lived next door to each other and shared a love for basketball. The same type of love-hate relationship between the couple in The Wood. The story proceeded to follow the relationship through high school, college (slightly reminded me of relationship between Epps and Tyra Banks in Higher Learning), and professional careers.  In the end, nothing was left for viewers to imagine, everything had been wrapped up.  I prefer movies that provoke thought and leave me wanting more.  There was nothing else to want at the movie's end. Once again this is a movie that makes viewers feel good (and maybe proud), but does not encourage deep thought.

The film was a pretty solid tale of childhood friends, then lovers, who pursue basketball as a career. Inventive and non-cliche film conventions (such as Monica's viewpoint during one of her games, as she urges herself to focus and concentrate) worked very well.  However, the film also relied heavily on alot of jive talk for it's humor- not unbelievable but excessive in my opinion (often sending the audience at the theatre I attended into OOOOOOOOHHHH! and You go, girl). Fine and dandy for the audience participation, but unfortunately a seletive predominant strength of the film. Finally, the initial love scene between the lead characters seemed awkward and forced (ie. hands placed unmoving on Monica's bossoms to avoid nudity).

The casting is eye-pleasing for both male and female viewers with Omar Epps and Sanaa Lathan. The story is pretty simple, and the title explains it all. I saw Monica (Sanaa Lathan) as perfect. She was fit, beautiful, and had a great respectable personality. The only flaw with her may have been her reaction to her mother just being a housewife. This isn't really a flaw, but it does show that she can be somewhat intolerant. With a female that likes to play basketball, you would expect her to be  somewhat feminist, and she was, but not to a great degree. The things she vouched for, such as equality even though she was a woman, is something everybody should have. Quincy (Omar Epps) was less perfect as a character. He went out with many shallow girls, perhaps because he was shallow too. A turning point in the movie was when Quincy finds out his father cheated on his mother. Monica tried to console him, but had to leave because of curfew. This leads Quincy to believe she cares more about following rules and basketball, than she does about love. I tried to imagine how I would feel from Quincy's point of view, and I came to the conclusion that I would think that she does not really care about me if she can't break a simple rule. Her excuse is that she wouldn't make him choose in a similar situation. Perhaps Quincy is making too much of this situation, or she really did make a mistake. Anyway, this leads Quincy and Monica to go their separate ways for a long time.The denouement is the two childhood friends playing basketball. Monica is playing for his heart. I think Quincy's character is a jerk most of the time, and he doesn't deserve a sweet person like Monica because she was never unfaithful to him, even though they were broken up.

The just are people who have been declared righteous, and have the right to receive every promise and blessing that is written in the bible.This movie showed two people who did just that. They knew and felt what God's desire was for their lives, they knew each other's heart and they strived for it. Personally, I received a spiritual meaning from the movie since it contains issues such as faith, trust, confidence and belief not only in their personal relationships, but more importantly, their trust and faith in God to give them the desires of their heart.I met my high school sweetheart in the 7th grade when we were around 11 or 12. We were together through high school, college and our adult life, however our intimate relationship ended due to various cirumstances.  She is still my very best friend in the whole world.I won't spoil what happened in the movie, however I do encourage everyone to follow their heart. You never know what God has in store. Remember, the just shall live by faith.

It could be very cheesy and romantic, but the presence of Spike Lee's production company raises the hopes.  The plot does start out slowly with some cute kid acting, happily this is only brief and not too bad.  The next two quarters of the film following Q and Monica in school and college and these two are the best.  The chemistry between the two is good and the romance feels genuine with faltering kisses, hesitation in eyes etc.  The final quarter sees the story come to a head and here it gets a bit like a soap, with family issues, tearful confrontations, motherly advice etc coming on strong.  The strongest sections focus on the romance between the two rather than the wider problems in their lives.The two leads are good.  Epps deals with the role well, but Sanaa Lathan is the surprise.  I thought she was really good - her character is really believable and she does well in showing her vulnerability behind her eyes and in her body language.  Some of the support cast are weak - the basketball team-mates are generally black stereotypes whose lines consist of girlfriend! or yo style dialogue but they are mostly in the background.  The most disappointing performance is Alfre Woodard, usually she is a sign of quality but here she is guilty of some very soapy acting.Overall this is a game of two halves, the second and third quarters are the best, but overall it's a nice romantic drama which gets a little soapy and sentimental towards the end.

The characters of the supporting cast was also good. The acting was well done, can't say that for all films.

Sanaa Lathan is an amazing actress with a lot of hidden talent. I am very familiar with Omar Epps. Gabriel Union played the classic high school b**ch in the movie. She was rather annoying and dissed Monica at the beginning of the movie. They could have just excluded her from the film to begin with. Tyra Banks could have also stayed out of the movie. Stick to modeling, she does that best. Other than all of that, the movie was good. There is very brief sexuality and nudity but sensible enough for children to see.

No, should be considered R.","Date":"22 December 2002","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Sport","Review":"  The title of the film comes from a comment near the end, when Monica's (Sanaa Lathan) boyfriend, Q, says, All is fair in love and basketball, a take-off of the old saying all's fair in love and war.  In a sense, basketball is war, as we clearly see in the interviews on the DVD extras with several real-life female basketball players. This is Monica's story. As a little girl she gets attracted to basketball and, as the film opens, she at 11 is dressed like a boy, hair pulled up under the cap, so she can get into the local pick-up game. It follows her through high school, then college at USC, then as a pro in Europe.  The boy next door becomes almost like a brother, he climbs into her bedroom window and sleeps on the floor when his parents are arguing. But it is a constant love/hate relationship between the two basketball stars who both end up playing varsity at USC.SPOILERS follow - Monica gets tired of pro basketball and comes home, mainly because she was lonely and unfulfilled. She never forgot Q and found out he was engaged to be married. Two weeks before the wedding she tells him she loves him, wants him to call off the wedding. They play a one-on-one at night to settle it.  Fade out, then in to last scene, Monica is playing prefessional basketball again, Q is watching her, with their child on her lap.A few words of summary cannot do the film justice. It is very well written and directed, but Sanaa Lathan is just great. She is in almost every scene, and she carries the film, makes it believable. But the language, nudity, and adult situations causes me to wonder how it gets a PG-13 rating. It definitely should be R.

From the title, you can deduct that it's a love story that uses basketball as a platform and that's exactly what it is. Quincy McCall (Omar Epps), son of fictional Los Angeles Clippers star Zeke McCall, and Monica Wright (Sanaa Lathan) live next door to each other in a Baldwin Hills neighborhood. Both are deeply devoted to the game Quincy has the talent to follow in his father's footsteps, Monica dreams of being the first woman to play in the NBA.Their friendship turns into love and takes them into their freshmen year at USC, the school that recruited them both. When Zeke becomes the target of a paternity suit, it tears his family apart. This leads Quincy to enter the NBA draft after only a year at USC. The action seems to be directed at his father, who wants his son to get a good education more than anything. Monica finishes college and goes on to play professionally in Spain. A large part of Monica's story is her relationship with her mother. Monica is very critical of her for letting her life pass her by, for letting herself be walked over, for never really standing up for herself. It parallels Quincy's story in that both are seeking to avoid the mistakes of their parents.I didn't expect a sports movie, but was still disappointed to find that it wasn't. The idea here, as with any film that revolves around sports, was to use the game for overt drama, while teaching life lessons along the way. Can you imagine if, say, Remember the Titans were actually about football? Likewise, L and B is not about basketball or even love but rather, how we are the choices we make in life. The film is already over two hours long so they had to be selective about what they showed, but I would have liked to see more basketball than there was. Not that they really needed to include more. They only show what's necessary to advance the story, as they should. It's just strange how little basketball there is in it, given the game's importance to the story. I'd like to see a film that shows women really competing and achieving the same way men have.  Love and Basketball isn't that film, but it did manage to plant this thought in my mind.Karyn Kasuma's Girlfight comes close, but it falls short in a similar way. Like Girlfight, when the bell rings, L and B backs off, like it's afraid women would rather watch talking heads than see their gender engaged in intense athletic competition.

The last quarter is in 1993, when Monica is playing in Barcelona, in the Vigo team, and Quincy breaks the ligament of his knee in a game America. Love & Basketball is not a bad movie, but something is missing to be a great film. One of its problems is the total lack of chemistry between Sanaa Lathan and Omar Epps they are good actress and actor, but they do not have any chemistry to perform the role of a romantic couple.

I wasn't really expecting too much from the title, but this is pretty good. Epps and Lathan put on good performances, although both come across as strangely low-key, considering that they are the stars of the show. I was very impressed with Dennis Haysbert, who played Quincy's father Zeke McColl, a former professional basketball player who follows his son's career with interest, while struggling in his own relationship with his family. In a relatively minor role, I was impressed by Christine Dunford as Monica's basketball coach at USC.The central focus of the movie, of course, is the relationship of Quincy to Monica. It's a wonderful tale of overcoming odds. But there are a number of sub-plots that are very interesting and take nothing away from the main storyline. The struggles of both Quincy and Monica as they pursue their respective basketball careers, and as they move in different directions - Monica becoming successful, Quincy struggling to make it; the troubled family relationships both have to endure, and in particular, Monica's with her mother, and Quincy's with his father. It all fits together very well. Yeah, the ending is a bit sappy and completely predictable, but otherwise, there's not much wrong with the story.So, why do I only give this a 6/10? For whatever reason - and this is strange I admit because the story is interesting enough - I found that this movie really dragged. It seemed much longer than the two hours it's supposed to be, and in spite of the good story I did find myself checking my watch every now and then wondering how long it would go.
