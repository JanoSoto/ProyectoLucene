I can only think of a few - and this is one of them.It is episodic, and may be broken into two halves - intentionally, importantly. The heart of the story is in the comparison of the first half and the second how the two men have or have not changed. If you consider this is the purpose of the film, the two halves are not perfect - but nevertheless a fascinating film.Bitterness, nostalgia and melancholy run through this character comedy from the 70's. Its a frank, confronting (depending on the viewer) laying bare of sex. Though there is very little actual sex in the film, this one is definitely only for adults. A penetrating character study, and a richly worded film filled with wit, irony and character penetration by cartoonist Jules Feiffer.9/10. Not perfect, but absolutely must-see.

Jack Nicholson creates one of his more complex characters here, which like About Schmidt or The King of Marvin Gardens, doesn't end up the happiest guy in town. His Jonathan is lusting, condescending, scared (deep inside), angry, and intelligent all at once, though never knowing himself well enough to know the one he's getting his rocks off with. On the flip-side his best friend Sandy (Art Garfunkel) is sensitive, unsure, though without a feeling of overt confidence and control like Jonathan has, and that feeling of confidence over the other sex is what keeps them together in discussion, and serves as a tinge in their friendship in their older age. In college, Sandy meets Susan (Candice Bergen), and is more of a friend at first, while Susan begins an affair she didn't intend on with Jonathan. This unfolds, and when they graduate and are out in the world Jonathan meets Bobbie (Ann Margaret) who is a pure vixen with, at the behest of Jonathan, is a louse and wanting a commitment Jonathan can't take. The last scene with Rita Moreno, and especially the last shot featuring an ice skater Jonathan saw once, say it all about his character- essentially, as it is with nearly all men, he wants what he can't have.Many of the angles and many of the one shots of faces for long stretches, the camera compositions and time length, etc, reminded me of techniques that director Ingmar Bergman used in his movies that dealt with relationships, men with women, and how the desperation in their personalities either become their downfall, or a life lesson later on. In a sense, Carnal Knowledge is Nichols' throwback to Bergman as was Interiors for Woody Allen, though his dealt with the strife in a family and Nichols is a character study dealing in love and sex. Never-the-less, non-art film goers shouldn't be scared off by the notion that Carnal Knowledge is bleak or sterile. It may not be the most cheerful, or an entirely fair to both sexes, but it is important in that it views Jonathan, Sandy, Susan, and Bonnie, as people, and Nichols doesn't force the viewer to judge these people if they don't want to. For its time it was groundbreaking, and today it's almost mature compared to the barrage of relationship movies of late. And, if anything, it should have mass appeal to devourers of film acting.

All is fine and good except one thing....YOU GOT MARRIED!!!!...Now enters the commitment, or shall I say, lack of it...There is a cynical outlook on each other.....The verbal abuse that is the end result of a relationship that has nothing but sex to offer, serves as an acrimonious aftermath to everyone's insincerity!! Some people (Ann Margaret) give up in life....Some people (Art Garfunkel) get resentful and searching...And others (Such as Jack Nicholson) remain misunderstood even to himself!! The college day's fiasco with Candace Bergen (Between Jack Nicholson and Art Garfunkel) should have served as a harbinger of things to come!! Instead, the hedonistic challenge casual sex provided for everybody, not only made people oblivious to the negative emotional battleground casual sex had the potential for presenting, but it established a pattern of recklessness for everybody's self centered priorities!! The prestige of being a Central Park West intellectual evokes an aura of false confidence, and it is evident that New York City merely spreads out the welcome mat for adversity before most any place else!! All of these theatrics simply translate to callous gratification! This is a film where people talk to one another, but it doesn't work out......So they have sex, they know they will grow tired of it, but when this occurs, they can't accept it either!!! Popular scapegoats seem to be; confusion, idealistic notions which have turned to blatant misconceptions, a distasteful awakening with selfishness, and disgruntled generalizations that Women are all ball-busters!! (Not just independent!!) It becomes a living nightmare for all of the characters concerned to distinguish between casual sex, and apathetic hobby!!! All of them are isolated by the negative consequences of casual sex!!! Jack Nicholson's condescension from a sex surrogate (Rita Moreno) denounces meagerness, and thus, becomes a form of precarious vindication which will give the movie audience a thorough comprehension of the type of person Jack Nicholson's character is, and always will be too!! Mike Nichols is a fabulous director, and this film is compelling in it's ability to tell the truth!!! The camera angles in this movie are spectacular! This film is very controversial for the time it was made because it brought to the attention of the movie viewer that the erroneous perceptions about recreational sex, and the truth about recreational sex are about as compatible a mixture as oil and water!! Nobody in this movie had any compunction about throwing necessary caution to the wind! The depiction of such people in Carnal Knowledge was very astute! Above all else with regards to this film, recognize the amazing array of talent this movie possesses!!

Each one of them has a different behavior and experience with women Jonathan is cynical, malicious, and selfish. He does not respect anybody (even his best friend is not respected) and just want to have sex. Women are objects for him. Sandy is almost the opposite of Jonathan and has a different approach with women he is shy and respectful, he does not have much experience with women. These characteristics are presented in the film having Susan (the gorgeous Candice Bergen, the most beautiful actress of the 70's) as pivot. Then the story advances a few years and shows both of them successful in their professions and boring with their mates. The character of Susan (who married Sandy) is just occasionally mentioned and does not appear on the screen any more. Now, we see basically the relationship of Jonathan with Bobbie (the sexy Ann-Margret). Then, there is another jump in time and other relationship of Jonathan and Sandy are presented in this movie, since its essence is about relationship of men and woman having the focus mainly in Jonathan. In 1971, I was too young to watch this movie and certainly I would not understand most of the story. Only a couple of days ago I had the chance of seeing it. It is amazing how this movie for adults has not aged. Further, it does not look like an American movie. The camera, the screenplay, it does look like European movie (maybe a little of 'Jules and Jim'). All the actors and actresses have outstanding performance, but certainly Jack Nicholson and Ann-Margret are superb.

It is also the movie that keeps reminding me why I love Jack Nicholson of his early years and how grand he was without his Jackness which he has developed during all these years. Sandy (Garfunkel) and Jonathan are two college friends and like every straight young (and not too young) man in the world they are obsessed by girls and move from one relationship to another in the course of almost thirty years. Nichols and Jules Feiffer who wrote the play and later adapted it for the screen let us look inside the minds and souls of two educated upper-middle class white males and to learn their very intimate thoughts and secrets concerning their plentiful dysfunctional and joyless affairs and it is not a pretty picture - Boys begin life not liking girls, later they don't change, they just get horny.

Sound depressing? It is, but it's also rather fascinating, due to a sharp script and excellent acting.This came out at a time when Jack Nicholson was actually playing characters in movies other than Jack Nicholson, and he does fine work here as the more virile and experienced of the two friends. Candice Bergen is also in fine form in a very dramatic role, a far cry from the comedic roles with which we've come to associate her. And Ann-Margret won a lot of acclaim (and the film's sole Oscar nomination) for her brief performance as the sex-pot basket case Bobbie, the target of Nicholson's emotional abuse.Carnal Knowledge is entertaining as an intellectual exercise, but it may leave you cold on a deeper, more emotional level, as no one, not even the women, are especially likable or sympathetic. It came out at a time in our cultural history when free love was in vogue, and seemed to suggest that the price people payed for indulging that urge was high and that people turned to casual sex more as an excuse for avoiding significant human contact than as a way to more fully enjoy living. Certainly these emotionally stunted characters seem no better off for all of their care-free indulgence in pleasure.In many ways, Carnal Knowledge seems to be the movie Mike Nichols' other 4-person relationship drama, Closer, wanted to be, and he would have been wise to approach the material in Closer in a similar way as the material here. The staginess in Carnal Knowledge works. These people seem to exist in a plane of existence just a fraction removed from the one in which the rest of us live. It's like they live in a vacuum where they're the only people who matter, an airless atmosphere that serves as a fitting backdrop for their selfish behavior.Probably not one of the more important films from this fertile period for film making, but worth checking out.Grade B+ "},{"Title":"A pure masterpiece.","Date":"8 March 2008","Score":"11 out of 15 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Just like Nichols' later masterpiece Closer, Carnal Knowledge expertly deals with romances falling apart, coming back together and the study of lust and it's many complications.

All of the arguments and especially the conversations between Jonathan and Sandy felt so natural, humorous and somewhat depressing. It evoked all of the emotions that lust in life does and perfectly demonstrates how rare true love and happiness is. The performances were all incredible and Ann-Margret more than deserved her nomination (the win in my opinion) but Jack Nicholson really shines above the rest of the cast. His realism, intensity and humor was top-notch to say the least. He also displays this internal pain that I can't even describe, but stunned me to my core.

The picture is an indictment of the entire 'the more we have, the more we want' mentality that ultimately leads to 'the more we get, the less we have' outcome. As the picture reveals, it probably takes a two or three decade span of failed relationships to figure all that out, even with the right role models in place. This review comes right in the middle of the tragic Tiger Woods extra-marital affair fiasco, and I ask myself if Woods would have learned anything if he had seen this picture earlier in his career. I don't think so.With the benefit of hindsight, Carnal Knowledge excels in portraying how things used to be back in those awkward days before everyone was forced to grow up before the age of ten or so. Today everyone has a cell phone, but there was a time when an entire floor of a women's college dorm had to share one. It would be virtually impossible today for Sandy (Art Garfunkel) to be unaware of Jonathan's (Jack Nicholson) involvement with Susan (Candice Bergen); somebody would have caught them on camera and posted it on the internet. So in that respect, the film is undeniably dated. Yet for it's time, the picture was a landmark in exploring the consequences of love and lust in a way that furthered a breakdown in the once traditional values of fidelity and morality. Today, I believe that liberal mission is almost complete.Interesting the way Nicholson took so many showers in the story. He always did it right after bedding down a conquest. It felt like he was attempting to subliminally wash away the grime of his own creepy existence. Moving in on your best friend's girl puts you in a special class of heel I think, and I surmise that Sandy 'got it' when Jonathan unceremoniously dismissed Susan in his apartment slide show. Wouldn't it have been great to see a scene between Jonathan and Sandy of the same magnitude as when Jonathan went off on Bobbie (Ann-Margret). It would have been good to see Sandy grow a pair to blow off twenty years worth of steam over the deception of a college buddy. But then again, Sandy was entranced by the ever wise, ever knowing new eighteen year old girlfriend. It's a good thing Carol Kane didn't have a speaking part.I'm curious today how Art Garfunkel wound up in the film opposite Jack Nicholson. That casting decision still eludes me, as his screen credits before and since have been scattered and somewhat eclectic. Nicholson, Bergen and Ann-Margret all received a boost of recognition with the commercial success of the film at the time as far as I can recall. It would be interesting to hear their thoughts about the picture and their roles in it with the perspective of nearly forty years gone by.

We first meet them as young collegians, impressionable, horny, and hugely vulnerable. Sandy (Art Garfunkel) and Jonathan (Jack Nicholson) know nothing about how the world of romance works, but Jonathan feels the need to act as though he is wiser than Sandy, a Lothario with a line of invisible women in his wake.One would expect the brash and shrewdly confident Jonathan to get a girl first, but it is actually Sandy, who finds and wins the attention of the intelligent Susan (Candice Bergen). Susan is perhaps too strong-willed to be tied down to Sandy, who is sensitive and much too lenient on the opinions of his peers. Eventually, Jonathan sets aside the burgeoning feelings of his friend and begins an affair with Susan himself, which doesn't end gracefully.Carnal Knowledge spans the next few decades, with Sandy and Jonathan's sexual hang-ups rarely changing. Sandy dreams of the girl who has the brains to match the bust, while Jonathan is so focused on t*ts-and-a*s that a great body is the number one priority, an emotional connection a close second. Sandy ends up marrying Susan; Jonathan has a string of affairs that hits its climax when he meets Bobbie (Ann-Margret), a voluptuous but needy redhead.The film doesn't preach; it studies. There are some people who are able to decipher the needs of the opposite sex with ease, making for blissful unions that last for years. But then there are the rest of the population, who never really get over the kiss-and-tell days of high school and remain to be too obsessed with sex to start and maintain a meaningful relationship. The film is about that unfortunate crowd.Carnal Knowledge doesn't have the same punchiness it once did in 1971 &#x97; today it feels rather tame &#x97; and, in some senses, doesn't go as deep and it could. Movies with miserable characters at its center can often times be so good that we don't get depressed along with them Mike Nichols, who directed the film, earlier turned the anger of a souring marriage into a glowing black comedy with tragic components in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?. That film managed to be enormously affecting, but it also didn't make you feel like a pile of sh*t by the end. And in John Cassavetes' Love Streams, the dreary existences of Sarah Lawson (Gena Rowlands) and her brother (Cassavetes) were fleshed with such extraordinary performances that their lives remained interesting long after the film ended.Carnal Knowledge has the ensemble drama characteristic in which the four main characters &#x97; Jonathan, Sandy, Susan, and Bobbie &#x97; carve out a net of sexual frustration around each other to the point in which life turns into a prison of dissatisfaction. Their world only revolves around each other. The outsiders, found in the other woman archetypes of Rita Moreno, Cynthia O'Neal, and Carol Kane, act as happy little pills, taking the leading men away from their own banal existences, periodically, only to ground them in reality once again. Nicholson and Garfunkel are terrific, and repositioning Margret from sex goddess status to that of a dramatic figure works quite well. Many say the film is a dark comedy, but I found no humor in its realm, and I looked in every nook and cranny. Some might find Sandy and Jonathan's failures to be melancholily funny, but, throughout the film, I was hopelessly depressed. Carnal Knowledge's components are spotless, but it forgets to do anything besides tell a story of constant grieving &#x97; maybe some can take it, but I certainly can't.Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com "},{"Title":"I Found This Rather Dull To Be Honest","Date":"16 May 2014","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" You can only watch a couple of guys (neither of whom, really, are all that likable) go through women for so long without it becoming a bit of a drag.

We follow Jonathon and Sandy from their time as room-mates in university to somewhere in middle age and we watch their relationships with women begin, evolve and end. I frankly didn't see a lot of point to this. No one really grew or changed (except for Sandy, who started off as kind of shy and awkward with women and ended up not much more appealing than Jonathon.) The women in these guys lives were a little more interesting, if only because they each had different ways of handling their always troubled relationships with them.The male leads in this were Jack Nicholson as Jonathon and Art Garfunkel as Sandy. Nicholson was good. He was given a somewhat more complicated character to play than Garfunkel, which reflects the fact that he was a more experienced and more accomplished actor. But there was little growth in Jonathon, and that just made the movie seem repetitive. I did like Ann-Margret as Bobbie, who was Jonathon's primary relationship in the movie. She was believable in the role, frustrated in the relationship - loving Jonathon but also angry with Jonathon. She did well. Candice Bergen as Susan was Sandy's primary love interest, although she disappears partway through the movie, and aside from picking up that they split up we don't hear much about her.The performances are the strength of this movie. It's fairly tame by modern standards, although it likely raised some eyebrows back in 1971, and I found the basic story to be lacking anything that would keep me glued to the screen.

The fact that Candice Bergen goes away after that also helps. Upper middle class ennui is something that's almost always tedious to watch, but this is actually affecting. Nonetheless, this feels like the beginning of the end for Mike Nichols. He would never again make anything on a level with Catch-22, and he followed this one up with Day of the Dolphins.

The very with it and confident Johathan is giving pointers to his friend the introverted and shy Sandy in how to pick up girls with him having his eye glued on pretty Susan,Candy Bergen, who's sitting alone at this very boring get together at the main collage dorm. Sandy who tries to make small talk with Susan is too shy and clumsy to open his mouth so it's Susan who starts up the conversation between the two.Before you know it both Sandy and Susan are going study with Jonathan, who wanted nothing at first to do with Susan, feeling left out in the cold. It's later that the very experienced Jonathan beats Sandy to Susan by deflowering her behind Sandy's back which in fact, in Jonathan's animal like behavior, draws her closer to the far more sensitive and feeling her pain Sandy. The film then goes some ten to 15 years into the future to the 1960's during the free love era where everything goes and it's the free and available bachelor, as well as tax and financial lawyer, Jonathan who's getting all the free love, and in some cases paying for it, with Sandy, My Son the Doctor and Gynecologist, now married to Susan and missing out on all the fun.By now the very sexually active Jonathan has gotten bored of all this sex he's been having and has cut down his yearly affairs, with different women, to about a dozen but is still looking for the women in his life that can keep him young and going strong ,in the sex department, until he's ready for the grave. That woman of his dreams turns out to be the sexy and flaming redhead and model Bobbie, Ann-Margaret, who ends up quitting her very high-paying job on TV commercials and shacks up with Jonathan in his bachelor pad in midtown Manhattan. It' not that long that Jonathan loses interest in Bobbie which turns her into a pill popping zombie sleeping as much as 18 to 20 hours a day and becoming addicted to dangerous and life threatening barbiturates. Sandy who had since broke up with Susan is now married to the bull-dike like Cindy, Cynthia O'Neal, who unlike the very sweet and womanly Susan wears the paths in the family.Things come to a head between Jonathan and Bobbie when after a very violet spat or fight between the two, over making the bed and sweeping out the apartment, that Sandy & Cindy show up to party. Jonathan trying to hid what's been happening between him and Bobbie comes up with this bright idea for him and Sandy to swap wives, a very popular thing among swinging couples back then, so that everyone can loosen up and release their pent up emotions. It's a moment later when a very willing Cindy, in going to bed with him, tells Jonathon that if her wimpy spouse Sandy lays as much as a hand on Bobbie he can forget to go back home that he realizes what a big mistake he made. That mistake was intensified when Sandy instead of having anything to do sexually with Bobbie calls the nearest hospital emergency ward after finding her in bed almost dead from an overdose of sleeping pills!It's now 1970 and both Jonathan and Sandy together with his now live in lover as well as love teacher the 18 year old hippie Jennifer, Carol Kane, are watching a slide show of Jonathan's many sexual conquests which included, and which slide he quickly withdrew, Sandy's first wife Susan. Not at all impressed in what Jonathan has to show them both Sandy and Jennifer leave him alone, the guy gives off such bad vibrations Sandy tells him, to his fantasies of years gone by. ***SPOILERS*** It's the final few minutes of the film that really shook me up in Jonathan having this hooker Louise, Rita Mereno,show up at his pad to pump up his both ego and now almost completely gone sexual drive.

I first saw this film when it was new and I was in college. It haunted me for years. I purchased the DVD last year and have watched it a few times and loaned it to friends whenever possible. I believe it to be an important film of social commentary that makes a very powerful statement about the place of sex in a person's life and how deeply disappointing it is when, through exploitation of sex as a recreational sport unto itself, affection and sex become irremediably alienated.Remembering that this film was produced in the heat of the Sexual Revolution, its conclusions seem prophetic in retrospect. The script is tightly written, and its points are worthy of deep consideration and discussion --- especially by the young. This is one of those cases in which art seems to be teaching a relatively conservative life lesson without delving into the murky territory of sexual morality. Rather, the script invites the audience to consider the toll paid for less than holistic intimacy and sexual exploits devoid of emotional commitment. Rather than preach some sort of monogamous sexual ethic on moral principles, it warns that the search for the ultimate sexual experience leads not to satisfaction, but to emptiness and impotence.I would rate this film as one of the top ten most meaningful published in my lifetime. It deserves a place with Albee, Ibsen, and other great dramas which show us something truly important about the human condition.The performances are all outstanding. In her role, Ann Margaret is the personification of female sexual allure. Art Garfunkel put in a convincing performance. I can't help but wonder why he never followed it up in a bigger way. I certainly could see him doing Woody Allen, Arthur Miller and Albee roles with great conviction. Jack is Jack -- in embryo.

For in this movie, the Jack Nicholson character is weak and child-like in his relationship with women. He needs women like a boy needs his mommy and then pushes them away when he begins feeling smothered, sending them double-messages that confuse them and in the process confuse him too. Ultimately, he winds up being alone, his narcissistic tendencies simply too powerful to be overcome by the obsessive drive to have have sex. This movie dramatizes the conflictual relationship between control and sex and how this conflict, unresolved, warps a man. This is one of Jack Nicholson's greatest movies.

Mike Nichols, more than once, proved himself to be eerily precocious, creating this incisive look at sexual dynamics at the age of 39.

This film decidedly pushed some boundaries in 1971, and remains relevant not only for its subject matter, but the intelligence and fine craftsmanship with which it's put together. Jules Feiffer's dialog is spot on, as are the performances. Jack Nicholson, at 34, looks a bit too old as a college student, but his acting is so good that's easily overlooked, and he more than fits the part as his character ages. Ann-Margret is a standout, a perfect choice for the part. The final scene with Rita Moreno is shocking in its offhanded, pedestrian approach to prostitution. Carnal Knowledge offers thinking adults a lot to savor and contemplate. Action fans, look elsewhere.

Banned in many venues, this did not deter this movie from becoming an American classic. It explores the dysfunction of American sexual relations of the time.This film is so well written, so well directed, and so magnificently acted, that to watch it, provokes great introspection. The subject matter is that of the title. It is the story of four people's journey through human friendship and sexual relations that is profound and significant.The weaving in and out of these relationships between these four people is mesmerizing. The movie starts with a college roommate relationship between two young men, draws in a mutual love affair, and through these friend's professional careers, compares and contrasts, the normal family man's constant blase sexual life, with the playboy's, at first exciting affairs, then his degradation into impotence. It is a very sad story.The script is presented in the first person, with the two male characters telling their stories, to whit the two female characters provide the emotional foil that reflects upon the male's soliloquies. The characters in this film provide a tour-de-force in the acting of the human heart.The two male stars of this movie, Jack Nicholson, and Art Garfunkel are really good in their rooting of this movie. They are in some ways the center. But their masculine performances really take a second seat to the two female stars.In the first part of the film Candace Bergen as Susan is almost breathtaking in her portrayal of the perfect sorority girl who has to choose between compassion and passion. She chooses compassion over the emotional doom of her passionate boyfriend. This crux of relationships is the focus of this film. The man chosen by the perfect Susan lives a life of boredom and order, with underlining sadness, but yet a sort of satisfaction.The passionate man that Susan left behind, is a sad product of the cynicism of the free love and sexuality of the time. And this lost man takes up with the ultimate tragic female film character's cheese cake Bobbie, who's characterization by the red haired ultra voluptuous Ann-Margaret, is perhaps the most heart wrenching and beautiful portrayal of a tragic female heroine of emotion ever put on the silver screen.In the end this film is the tragedy of the sexual mediocrity of everyday life and the failure of those that attempt the provocative. This is a great film, the DVD widescreen transference, necessary for it's back and forth conversational scenes, is first rate. This classic Adult film is recommended and costs practically nothing these days on the internet market.B. A.

That's what this movie is about, especially from the point of view of Jonathan Fuerst, expertly portrayed by Jack Nicholson. The movie begins with voices and a dark screen, Jonathan and his good friend and roommate Sandy (Art Garfunkel, of Simon and Garfunkel singing fame) are taking at a college mixer. Jonathan is explaining to Sandy the finer points of seducing women. The immediate object of Sandy's attention is Susan (a young, pretty Candice Bergen) who is sitting alone near a window. Sandy eventually asks Susan out, and they begin dating.The movie is a tragic story, of these two men, close friends, but worlds apart in how they view the world. Jonathan seems unable to form any bonds with either males or females. He sees each as objects to either facilitate getting what he wants, or obstacles to getting what he wants. And, all he seems to want is 'carnal knowledge.' Every description he gives of a female relates to how she looks and whether he would like to have sex with her. (My college roommate in 1963 was almost like this.) Opposite, Sandy is truly a gentle soul, wanting relationships, and sometimes too eager to follow Jonathan's advice. Over the 20-odd years of this story, it doesn't quite work out for either of them, and we are left wondering if Sandy's outlook became tainted by knowing Jonathan. Ann-Margret, as beautiful as ever, has a key role as Bobbie who becomes Jonathan's girlfriend.SPOILERS FOLLOW. As we follow the lives of the two men, out of college and into working life, both have successful careers, Sandy as a doctor. Sandy never finds out that in college Jonathan seduced Susan and had an ongoing clandestine carnal relationship with her even while she and Sandy were dating. Sandy and Susan eventually married, had children, but were divorced. Susan never really loves Sandy, and couldn't have Jonathan. No one could. Bobbie tried. After convincing Jonathan they should 'shack up' (live together), she almost went crazy until he married her, but it didn't last. In the end both Jonathan and Sandy are single, dating the wrong kinds of women. Jonathan has become virtually impotent, and the movie ends with his regular prostitute collecting her $100, and going through the ritual they established so that he might become aroused. Tragic story, however perhaps real.

Almost 33 years later, it feels a bit stagey and has an overstylized look that somewhat alienates.  It's still a good film and everything bad about men -their fear of commitment, the lying, the sexual obsessions, the inability to love someone else, the anger directed against women- was displayed here first making it the grandaddy of other movies like Neil LaBute's In the Company of Men and Your Friends and Neighbors.There's also a strong homosexual undercurrent between the two main characters -Sandy and Johnathan- that I don't think has ever been commented on  Johnathan showers compulsively after sex with Bobby (could be a Catholic thing though), the men smoke huge, phallic-like cigars while discussing their sexual prowess, a hushed conversation about partner swapping is done in such a tight close-up you feel like they're about to kiss, and the only true intimacy these two have is with each other.  It seems like an unintentional/slightly intentional, non-sexual homosexual relationship -like The Fight Club, if you will, except that film got out of its corner by climaxing with a 'surprise twist'.Mike Nichols's talents are more suited for the stage than film but he is the leader when it comes to handling actors the performances he gets from Jack Nicholson, Art Garfunkel, Candice Bergen, and Ann-Margret are superlative.  Jack and AM are on fire in their scenes while Art and Candice play simply and beautifully.  Rita Moreno and Cynthia O'Neal contribute their 'game gal' personas and make the brief time in which they appear quite memorable.Carnal Knowledge is a slick, cynical, satirical take on male sexuality and (flaws and all) ranks right alongside the best films to come out of the seventies; it should not be missed.

There is no x-rated material in the movie and it isn't shocking in any way (except perhaps the 'ballbusters on parade - a Jonathan Fuerst production').  I saw it at age 14 and thought it was a good film.  Years later I heard what the WORD 'carnal knowledge' means.  Nowadays I see people act their act and people fade away and realize that some have always put on some act and that gives this movie an extra dimension obviously.  In ten years it will be different again for me.  Friendship changes apparently  and it will not always make you happy.  Neither will marriage.  The ground-breaking aspect of the film may be the taboo subject matter that will probably be completely vanished with the arrival of Viagra.Cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunno worked with Luchino Visconti (il Gattopardo, Rocco e i suoi fratelli) and Federico Fellini several times (Amarcord, E la nave va, CittÃ  delle donne), and was a good choice for this movie.  Nichols and Fellini had a conversation on the set of Catch-22 (1970, Nichols), where they probably discussed the work of Rotunno and Nichols decided to ask him for the cinematography of Carnal Knowledge (don't know whether that is true or not, but it sounds nice).  Rotunno delivered great work on this one.  I prefer it over 'il Gattopardo' (1963) actually, but not over his Fellini-films.  He later collaborated with Nichols on Regarding Henry (1991) and Wolf (1994).So, I had to put more than average attention to fathom the movie, but when I finished the film and especially after several viewings, it evolved into one of my favourite films by Nichols.  I'm probably going to see it for the fifth time soon.  Credit to all four actors Candice Bergen, Ann-Margret, Art Garfunkel and Jack Nicholson.  Garfunkel (Catch-22) and Nicholson (Five easy pieces, One flew over the cuckoo's nest, Shining, the Raven) perform their subtlest role ever in this almost epic film (because it covers so much time and life-stages) that may be a sign of the times (between the sixties and the seventies) in more than one way and is of course a personal drama.

The 1970s brought sex, language and nudity to the big screen and this here was one of the most controversial films of its time but it's also one of the greatest films that has ever dealt with sex and relationships. The movie is brutally raw in its anger, passion and conversations but this is what really makes it stand apart. The dialogue is perfect, the story structure is flawless and we're given some of the best performances that you're ever going to see. I really love the way Nichols structured the picture and especially in the beginning as we see the Garfunkle character fall for a girl (Candice Bergen) but never realizing that Nicholson has gone behind his back and started a relationship with her. The way this love triangle is shown is just flawless in its execution. The middle portion of the film deals with Nicholson's relationship with Bobbie (Ann-Margret) and this too is flawless but incredibly depressing. There's a masterful sequence with the two of them crying and fighting, which is as powerful as anything you're going to see from this era. The entire cast does a fabulous job fitting into their roles. There's no question about Nicholson's brilliance during this era and that includes this film where he plays such a jerk that you can't stand him. The real surprise here is Garfunkel and Ann-Margret, both of them giving the performances of their careers. Nichols' direction is among the best of his career and especially the way he milks the story so well to get every sort of emotion out of it. CARNAL KNOWLEDGE isn't a pretty film to watch due to how ugly the Nicholson character is but it's still one of the best acted films out there and the rawness is something missing from most movies today.

Nicholson plays a manipulative misogynist and Garfunkle plays his dorky, sensitive chum. We watch them grow and mature and finally come to the realisation that they're both insensitive pigs.In the opening segment, set in the 1940s, the two young men compete for the affections of a sultry Candice Bergen. The scene is tender and insightful, and promises a greatness that the film never manages to deliver.Still, there's a lot to like. The cinematography is warm and interesting and Nicholson is very watchable. Like Bogart, he seems to have entered the world of cinema as a wise and grown man. I've never seen a young Jack Nicholson. Heck, even in his Roger Corman flicks he looks strangely middle-aged. Indeed, in Carnal Knowledge he plays a 20 year old despite being in his 30s.The film then jumps ahead ten years. Garfunkel is a bored husband and Nicholson is increasingly misogynistic, using women and seeking to domesticate them all. The film's final segment then shows the ageing friends attempting to cope with the unfamiliar values of the late 1960s.Nicholson's performance here did much to consolidate his stardom. The three films, Carnal Knowledge, Five Easy Pieces and The Last Detail, created a public persona that he still wears to this day. That is, the Jack the crazy but lovable misogynist persona; a man who uses women, claims them, beats them into submission, discards them or, as is the case of this film, purposefully sabotages relationship so that they leave.The Jack persona is ultimately looking for a dream. A fantasy woman. A male generated object of desire that is forever unattainable and so requires constant product replacement. In real life, if we believe the tabloids, Nicholson lives a similar life.7/10 - Carnal Knowledge isn't a great film, but it's brilliantly acted and features some really great rants by Nicholson.

Later in their lives, we find Jonathan married to Cindi, played by Cynthia O'Neil, and passingly happy. Sandy is facing a mid-life crisis as his girlfriend, played by Ann-Margret asks him to marry. Sandy looks at women as if they have to meet certain physical criteria to meet his exacting standards--a few more inches here, a bit less somewhere else, as if choosing a partner is like picking a good cut of meat. The nudity is explicit by the standards of 1971. The film is not prudish in dealing with with sexuality. We see shower scenes with people getting dressed and undressed as common as lighting up for a cigarette. The movie has a certain European feel with scenes standing as little vignettes.

The main focus is on the women in their lives, but it is interesting to note that it is the friendship between the two men that survives some double-dealing by Johnathon (does anybody play the cad better than Nicholson?) and unstable relationships with women.When we first meet the two guys they are sharing a dorm room at Amherst. They talk a lot about sex and are just on the cusp of becoming active. Johnathon is on the trail-head to the path toward being a Lothario--he is mainly interested in sexual appearances. A pivotal scene toward the end has Johnathon presenting a slide show of his female conquests. On the other hand Sandy is shy and thinks he wants something deeper. Neither of the guys seems to be able to relate to women as equals but rather only as to how well their women can fulfill preconceived fantasies. When one of Johnathon's girlfriends tries to get serious he panics.On several occasions in the dorm conversations when certain women are mentioned Johnathon comments, I wouldn't kick her out of bed. I recall that being a common phrase in the era of this movie. Thinking of the implications of that comment is sobering. Most of the time when I heard it I had the thought, There is no way that you could *get* her into your bed. In judging the movie you have to keep in mind that it mostly takes place before the advent of the birth control pill and at a time when Playboy Magazine was still considered risquÃ©. The music dates the episodes.Interesting to compare this with some contemporary (circa 2010) takes on the subject, maybe best illustrated by the movies of Judd Apatow and Richard Linklater. The modern take seems much lighter and less fraught. Many people see much humor in CN, but I see it playing more as a tragedy, both for the individuals and for the women of the time. It is hard to envision a happy future for either Johnathon or Sandy. They were doomed to be trapped by the dominant moral codes at the time while being destined to deal with more more independent women as time went on. It is a tragedy for the women who had to contend with such men as Johnathon and Sandy, and still do to a great extent.I found the acting to be uniformly good with Ann-Margaret being the standout as one of Johnathon's girlfriends.

However, Closer was more about our immaturity when it comes to love & sex, while Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a dense dialogue on the troubles of married life. Nichols' Carnal Knowledge, brilliantly written by cartoonist Jules Feiffer (easily, one of the finest and most underrated screenplays of the 70s), has much more similarities to Closer than Virginia Woolf, and it stands as real and believable now as almost 40 years ago. The story of two college friends (Jack Nicholson and Arthur Garfunkel) who compete for women and are never truly satisfied, hurting people along the way and ultimately losing themselves, is a lot like the story of Dan, Alice/Jane, Anna and Larry from Closer - showing that decades fly, sexual revolutions come and go, and the human being remains the same wild, complicated animal. Both Carnal Knowledge and Closer can be considered moral tales, without being simplistic or clichÃ©d - they stand as some of the rawest studies of the human nature, the search of love and pleasure ever put on film. Jack Nicholson, Candice Bergen, Ann-Margret and even Art Garfunkel are magnificent, and we have two very special appearances by Rita Moreno and Carol Kane near the end. Not as well regarded as other Nichols' classics such as The Graduate, Carnal Knowledge deserves a bigger status than it currently has. If you liked Closer, you won't be disappointed by this.

That being said, it does have it's moments. Garfunkel is good as the shy man, afraid to be assertive with a woman. In Catch-22, you don't really get to know Garfunkel much. In this movie, he is featured as the co-star to Jack Nicholson. Garfunkel's character goes through the ordinary changes of a professional class man from college through middle age. He is married, but grows weary of his bossy, perfectionist wife. Nicholson's character is really a study in conflict. Although not visibly despicable, Nicholson's character is a sex addict doomed to failure and destruction of other people's lives. He doesn't want to hurt people, but does. Ann Margaret is good as a beautiful model/commercial actress, who is slowly ruined by Nicholson's lust only for sex and uncaring attitude about her personal, human side. In the end, Nicholson grows into a sick middle aged man, who can only talk wistfully about all his conquests in life. However, he is addicted to sex, and it rules his life. This is kind of an unusual movie for the early 70s. It is the opposite of the libertarian values of the day. It is a critical look at relationships that was more in vogue during the 80s and 90s. The movie falls short, because it tries to tell a story about two very differing friends in an entertaining way. However, by tackling such a complex subject as human sexuality and deviancy, it leaves out a lot. We never get to really understand what in the Nicholson character's life made him the way he was. We just get a hint, as an audience. In conclusion, it was a good movie, but not a great movie, because it just couldn't completely and sincerely tackle the subject it was embracing.

Soon after we see the dynamic between them. Jonathan the all-knowing advice giver and Sandy the wide-eyed naive, both desperate for a chance to cop some action from the opposite sex. Sandy meets Susan (Candice Bergen) and they begin a relationship. Sandy spends his evenings disclosing all information about this to Jonathan who becomes intrigued. Jonathan and Susan start an affair behind Sandy's back. Suddenly, we're in New York. Jonathan and Sandy are grown up, Sandy is married to Susan and Jonathan is still looking for fresh meat.Jonathan is the character we spend the most time with after the college segment. Nicholson's character is weak, angry and confused and he plays him with so much passion and complexity that it's often hard to figure out what he wants, which is true for the character himself. Garfunkel's character arc is played surprisingly well by the singer, visibly hardening and maturing while Jonathan remains childlike. Ann-Margret plays Bobbie, Jonathan's eventual girlfriend and she underplays her role to perfection, never resorting to the teary-eyed mess that most women were stereotyped to be at the time.Nichols' style is even more evident here than in The Graduate, sometimes to the point of overkill. He uses devices like training his camera often on only one subject during scenes involving several subjects, long single shot takes and stylish lighting schemes. The film is shot almost as a play, the camera spectates and lets the performances do the talking, telling you where to look as would a spotlight. As a result, some people may find it difficult to watch, although anyone who enjoyed Nichols' more recent Closer will find something interesting here. This is not a light and happy film. It's subject matter is heavy and at times disturbingly bleak. Groundbreaking for it's time, Carnal Knowledge is definitely worth a look for Nicholson fans and a must for Nichols fans.

Send the kiddies to bed and pop open a bottle of something. If you don't smoke, start..Jonathan (Jack) and Sandy (Art) are college buddies interested in girls..only. You don't see them in a classroom or even with a book. Sandy talks to Susan (Candy) at a mixer and they soon begin dating. Getting pressure from Jonathan to make moves on her, Sandy does, and eventually Susan responds. This gets Jonathan interested in Susan, too. Susan puts out for Jonathan before Sandy, and since Jonathan has to tell he just got laid, Jonathan also has to tell Sandy not to tell Susan. When Sandy first asks Jonathan his girlfriends name, it leads to the funniest line in the movie...Myrtle! Jonathan and Susan stop seeing each other because the jealousy begins too much of a burden for both of them, and let's face it, Jonathan was only using her for sex in the first place.Female Ice Skater in White on the Central Park rink represents a lapse in time..insert that now...Jonathan meets Bobbie (A-M) who is unbelievably built but that bastard Jonathan STILL doesn't appreciate her cause she's doesn't have a PERFECT something-or-other. Bobbie and Jonathan soon begin a malignant relationship based on dependence, disrespect and drama (the Three D's) and it gets worse and worse every scene. Meanwhile Jonathan has married Susan, who you never see following the first appearance of the Female Ice Skater in White. But soon Jonathan wants to cheat on Susan, and gets a woman named Cindy who looks like her female part have little teeth on them as to cut off if you dare penetrate her.I've only gone over some of what happens. Jack takes a minimum of eight showers - every time I watch this I say I'm going to count them, and then I forget.Ann-Margret is astonishing as Bobbie. No one I've ever seen in a movie makes depression look like that. She's breathtaking. Its her movie all the way, cemented by the fact that she was the sole Oscar nominee in the cast. She'd have won if it were up to me. As much as I like Cloris Leachman in The Last Picture Show, this performance by Ann is practically tattooed on my brain and has been for quite a long time now. I love even small moments like the way she carries her and Jack's dinner into their bedroom on a tray, remembering to bring napkins and the salt and pepper. Then when Jonathan and Sandy and Cindy are playing tennis on the roof of their apartment building, she's sitting there in a big coat and a kerchief, reading a magazine like she's having an internal breakdown, and when Jonathan puts her down once again, how she turns around and lights a cigarette. You never see anyone play tennis, you just hear it - the camera is on Cindy and Bobbie the whole time. That's what's so great, you don't often see who's talking. The camera is at times where it wouldn't be were a conventional director in charge. Nichols isn't playing tricks, he just makes it all .. fascinating.

Or sex, really. The women themselves are little more than the owners and annoying defenders of the vaginas their penises really would like to get to know. Among the women they bother are Candice Bergen, Ann-Margret, Rita Moreno (whom I don't even remember being in the film, honestly), Cynthia O'Neal and Carol Kane (who isn't allowed even to speak). The film is very dry and clinical, and also very boring. I think Mike Nichols made a far more successful film of the same type with Closer in 2004.

His whole style is a brilliant, fresh, bold, very distinctive manipulation to center the audience. I first saw this in his career-making classic film The Graduate, but despite how golden that film is made out to be, Carnal Knowledge is really a better film because it doesn't thrive on the direction. It actually had an essentially threadbare story, where Carnal Knowledge has a much more coherent and personally tactile script, written by Jules Feiffer, who wrote the brilliant black comedy Little Murders.Feiffer helms a very cerebral and deeply understanding script, which we learn in just the first scene of dialogue, which plays over a black screen presenting the opening credits. It's between the characters played by Art Garfunkel and Jack Nicholson, and they both share their earliest perspectives on sex with women. It's a conversation of very tender truth, the likes of which we haven't really heard in a a film with frank talk of sex or romance since this film. His story proceeds to follow the frustrated but decidedly normal lives of these two best friends, contrasting two very different and oft-misunderstood sexual personalities.Nicholson can't help but hurt his lovers and himself because his idea of an affair is something that is by rule at arm's length that must dissolve. He is attractive and has a charming appearance to women, but he is too unlike his sensitive friend Art Garfunkel to see deeply enough to connect his effect on a woman in the bedroom to an effect on a woman outside of it. His goal in life is the perfect ten between his sheets. When sexual shortcomings begin eating away at his ego, he has no deep connection with someone else and thus has no way to handle them. Garfunkel is less attractive and very ungraceful, but he is easily affected and seeks a level of tenderness with a woman, which he's lucky enough to find in his first girlfriend, played with a great understanding of the tightly wound bookish girl by Candice Bergen. He seeks emotional security in sex, and when unbeknownst to him Nicholson's actions early in the film effect that goal, it forever confuses him.Ann-Margret is great, especially in a theatrically fiery argument with Nicholson, where she never cries or breaks down but cardinally lets bits and pieces of both slip from her control, and we realize the state she's in. Rita Moreno, in a smaller role, plays the true metaphorical castrator that Nicholson paranoidally sees in each woman he gets close to, presenting to him in a brief and memorable moment of hers what the real thing is like.Carnal Knowledge is a timeless communication of things about human beings that one wishes were not so unmentionable.

True this is a film about the very different thoughts of male and female relationships, but much more can be found like finding yourself and it is important to find what makes you happy. Also this film was made at a time that pushed the sexual boundaries to new limits, Mike Nichols shows that he's not worried about pushing the envelope to the next level. The early 70's was a time when this kind of material was just new on the scene and this picture caused an uproar about obscene behavior, but the film had scenes that were done in an artistic way even when it had nude scenes Nichols didn't make them obscene.Jonathan Fuerst(Jack Nicholson) and Sandy(Art Garfunkel) are two college roommates who are eager beavers to explore ladies and sex, Jonathan is a open-minded extrovert and Sandy is an introvert who's more cautious. Anyway the dating begins when both encounter a young and conservative girl named Susan(Candice Bergen in one of her earliest roles) then the love and sex start for all three. As Jonathan breaks off going another direction that being his wild ways, while Sandy later weds Susan.The film then starts to span the generations showing both male characters who are strong and tell their take on relationships from their point of view in first person. Then we are introduced to the mature and very voluptuous and sexy kitten Bobbie(Ann-Margret who's at her all-time sexy best!) Bobbie becomes the lover of Jonathan who's still sex driven and enjoys his time in bed he would never throw her out! Only then the film takes it's first point to show the big differences between the male and female mind thoughts. As Bobbie wants marriage and family but that is a no for Jonathan, who's happy just loving and enjoying his pleasure that makes him feel good within. As the film goes along good friend Sandy continues to enjoy marriage even after he departed with Susan, but for his good friend John the settling down thing will just never work. As the film ends with both men being happy from within.A good overall view of Carnal Knowledge is that from the very beginning it's a film not worried about expressing things as from the opening credits one can tell it's a hormone driven film. But Nichols does this theme of sexual freedom in a professional manner with very mature and strong characters, having them to share their thoughts make the film so interesting. And the nude and love scenes are a great tease to audiences, that makes anyone watching feel good pleasure and think sexual freedom will become a good thing. And Mike Nichols sure opened doors with this film that causal sex can be OK and he shows that many characters can be happy even if they never find any true love. Nichols proves point with this film that males are more sex driven, and females care more about love. Jack Nicholson is top notch as always, giving a tough character performance that includes wit, humor, toughness and good emotional anger while all along being happy with himself as a man who obsesses with women. Art often imitates real life, as Jack has always been known as the great seducer. Carnal Knowledge is an underrated classic that lets a viewer feel pleasure in an artistic manner and it proves sex is not bad and it can fulfill a person within.

I could live the rest of my life gladly without seeing him essay another role; although his gentle demeanor fits his character here well enough, he's able to offer absolutely nothing in the way of emoting to the audience. In fact all the actors in this film were poorly directed by Mike Nichols, and this film has lowered my opinion of him further than it already was.The story follows Nicholson's character, to the point where Bergen's more interesting character drops completely out of the movie after the first third. He is a womanizer who develops ritualistic sexual fetishes and becomes convinced that all women are ballbusters. Presumably the character is supposed to be reprehensible and his evolution is supposed to represent in some way the degeneration of the male sexual libido under the influences of the sexual revolution. The whole thing is didactic and ridiculous, and as if to add insult to injury we have to accept at the end that Garfunkel has somehow discovered the ideal romance with a teenage hippy (Carol Kane, who never gets to speak more than a line of dialog, if that). On the whole, the perspective is just as rudimentary as what Nichols had held forth in his more famous film The Graduate, a naive kind of sexual modernism that seems to hold that our human species is somehow evolving in terms of our sexual maturity, and that characters like the Nicholson one would soon be disappearing from the face of the Earth. On the other hand, the perspective of the misogyny is so heavy in this film that it's certainly possible to mistake it for a chauvinistic film, which is perhaps how some of its fans have taken it since it seems that Nicholson's tirade against Ann-Margret is the most beloved scene in the film. Indeed, it was the only one that made me laugh or that seems to have much conviction, but Nichols and the writer Jules Feiffer betray it subsequently.This film, as well as Mike Nichols, has fans. I don't really have the audacity to say that it's a horrible picture. But it's certainly not for me. The style of the whole thing is too bland, it still feels very stage-bound to me.

Since he hasn't been in a boat load of movies lately, I decided to see some of his older ones. Overall, I am impressed by them from his Oscar winning work for One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest to his trademark performance in The Shining. But Carnal Knowledge is the first movie I have seen him in that I absolutely did not like.I had the assumption that this would be a comedy about the sexual desires of a man over women. Sure, I anticipated sex, and some innuendos, but a decent film. Well, I found nothing decent about it. The film is a complete bore fest, made up of Nicholson and Garfunkel talking about which girl to bang and how many foul, maligning, and sexist words they can deliver in a 90 minute period. I was absolutely disgusted by it.Garkfunkel looked bored with the film and just went along with it, not even bothering to put some effort into his character. A young and beautiful Candice Bergen is to busy smiling and giggling to even be a believable character. Anne Margaret, well, like Candice, she has great looks, but is a pain in the butt by her constant whining and drug overdoses. Nicholson seemed to have fun with himself, but is not even in comparison to all his other performances. Maybe this is because this was one of his earlier movies. Either way, he wasn't great.There was no plot and no good acting. Needless to say, this was not a good movie. I was even surprised that this was even made back in 1970. Uhm? I can understand people calling it a controversial movie, but only because of all the sexual dialog. 1/10 -For those of you who like the old movies, skip this one and see something else. "}]
