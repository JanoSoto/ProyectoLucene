His wife Amy (Helen Mirren) delivered a note to Ray, where Jack expressed his last desire. Along their journey in a Mercedes Benz, the story of their lives is disclosed through flashbacks or thoughts, where deep secrets are revealed to the viewers along 109 minutes of this excellent film. The cast of this movie is outstanding and their performances are fantastic. There are many subplots and in the end, all the characters are very well developed though their personal dramas, recollections and dialogs. A touching movie about friendship, revelations and farewell, and highly recommended for sensitive persons.

And, without question, the death of a long-time, close friend or associate can effect such a catalysis, which is precisely what happens in `Last Orders,' directed by Fred Schepisi, a drama that suggests that perhaps the end of a life can offer a valuable and renewed perspective to those who go on to write yet another chapter of their own in this great book we fondly know as the Human Comedy.  Finally, it's about individual resolve and beginnings that can be found in endings, and the life therein reserved for those who may yet count themselves among the living. Jack (Michael Caine), a working class butcher in London, planned one day to retire with his lovely wife, Amy (Helen Mirren), to the seaside hamlet of Margate.  As often happens in life, however, Jack was denied the realization of his dream by the unbidden intervention of Fate, in the form of it's eternal emissary, The Grim Reaper.  But Jack enters his everlasting sleep even as he lived his life, one step ahead of the other guy; and the attainment of his final wish begins with the consigning of his ashes to his three closest, life-long friends and his son, Vince (Ray Winstone), along with a request he adjures them as a group to honor.  And so it is that Vince, Vic (Tom Courtenay), Lenny (David Hemmings), and Jack's best friend, Ray (Bob Hoskins), set out on a journey to effect the `Last orders' of their good friend, Jack; a journey that will take them into the future by way of the past, as they reflect upon what has gone before, and the possibilities that now lay ahead.With this film, Schepisi has crafted and delivered what is essentially a moment in time; a moment he examines through a sentimental journey rife with all of the hard knocks and stoic truths that made up Jack's life, and which he presents just as Jack lived it.  And a sentimental journey though it may be, don't expect to be seeing it through rose colored glasses.  As the story unfolds, what emerges is a portrait of a complex individual made up of the myriad and many facets of the human condition.  And each flashback, combined with an episode from the present, reveals another piece of the puzzle that was Jack; and by the end, the picture we have of him is complete.  We see him for who and what he really was, good, bad or indifferent, with all the flaws and foibles that were part and parcel of the ebb and flow of his life-- everything that defined him as a human being.  Also, inasmuch as the story is told through the eyes of his friends and loved ones, it necessarily follows that they are revealed, as well, especially Amy and Ray.  We do get to know Vince, Vic and Lenny, of course, but to something of a lesser degree.  In the final analysis, then, what Schepisi has created here is nothing less than an intimate and incisive character study through which Jack, his friends and their story comes vividly to life.  Schepisi does the material proud, but then he was, of course, afforded the talents of an extraordinarily gifted ensemble cast, from which he extracts a number of memorable performances.As Lawrence Jamieson in 1988's `Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,' he was the most suave and sophisticated gentleman (albeit con man) the screen has seen since Niven or Grant, but without question, since his portrayal of `Alfie,' in 1966, Michael Caine has been everyones favorite cockney, and no one-- make that NO one-- does it better.  And it's precisely that nuance of character that Caine brings to his portrayal of Jack that makes him so alive and convincing.  Caine can be ingratiating even when he's playing a `hard' guy, and there is a decidedly hard side to Jack; but there's a very caring side to Jack, too, which Caine also manages to convey with facility, and he does a splendid job of fusing the many sides of his character into one very real whole.  It's the kind of top notch performance we've come to expect from Caine, and it makes his character and the film entirely credible.When it comes to playing cockney, Caine may be the King, but Bob Hoskins is certainly the Crown Prince, coming in a close second.  These two, in fact, would clean up if the Oscars ever decided to include the categories of Best Cockney and Best Supporting Cockney.  There are times, perhaps, when you have to turn an ear in to understand what they're saying, but it's part of the charm and viability of their respective portrayals.  And Hoskins has an appeal all his own, and though he lacks Caine's charisma, he does have a definite screen presence, all of which helps to make the relationship between Ray and Jack believable.The wonderful Helen Mirren, meanwhile, turns in a remarkably poignant performance as Amy.  Her portrayal readily brings the inner conflicts and complexities of her character to the fore, as Mirren successfully shows us the many sides of this woman, who is wife, lover and mother, all rolled into one.  Most importantly, her Amy is so human; there is an earthiness to her, but it is tempered by her more maternal and caring instincts, and it lends an honesty and integrity to the character that makes her very real. Courtenay, Hemmings and Winstone turn in noteworthy performances, too, each making the utmost of the screen time they are afforded, successfully establishing their characters and the nature of their relationship with Jack as well as one another.  It's all a part of what makes `Last Orders' such entertaining and engaging cinema, a film that is both sincere and unforgettable.  And that's the magic of the movies.  9/10.

It was kind of disconcerting.  I mean, who could blame people -- the film got no billboards or even advertisements, and I only heard about it through reviews in the paper. But this one's a keeper last time you had Caine & Hoskins working like this was Neil Jordan's crime drama Mona Lisa.  It's great to see them reunite.     This is really an ensemble film, with great direction and great editing as well.  The flashbacks are very well placed, so you don't get a sense of distraction as much as clarification as the filkm goes on.  And the filmmakers wisely decide to use visual cues for the memories, instead of arbitrary looks back at the past.    I can say after seeing this film, I hope that I can end my life with the same kind of buddies as Jack Dodds (withou' o' co'se the necessi'y  o' ge'in sloshed every nigh'.)  The ensemble really works well off each other -- Ray Winstone, who was nearly incomprehensible in Sexy Beast, here shows a bit more substance as Jack's wayward but successful son.  Helen Mirren pulls in a much more vulnerable performance than usual as Jack's wife (and the woman who played her as a young woman is stunning.)  Tom Courtenay and David Hemmings provide a nice contrast as the proper undertaker Vic, and the drunken ex-boxer Lenny, yet you can see how they would both appeal to a guy like Jack, a lover of life.       Of course, for reasons I don't know if I'll ever get, Hoskins is the anchor.  I've watched him for many years, playing brutes and sidekicks, mobsters, and fathers, at times playing the Irish, the Australian, the English, or the Italian-American.  He has way of blending in and winning your attention.  He can be brash, idiotic, cruel, or sweet, wise, and bold, but either way you kind of root for the guy.  You can always seem to see his wheels turning just by facial expressions.  The guy might never get an Oscar, but his performances are almost always memorable.   The young actors all convincingly match their older counterparts,a and I found myself watching the way the young Vic went about his medical work and swing dancing and wondering if I'd be lucky enough to end up that way, as Jack says, having it figured out.    The ultimate message of the film is as simple and yet profoundly human as the story itself ending your life is easy, it's the carryin' on that's hard.  That's not to say that life is meaningless or awful, but just that you've got to put your heart into it, as Schepisi himself has done here.  Last Orders and Lantana are two of the best unknown films out there right now.  Check 'em out.

It Has It's Rewards","Date":"4 February 2002","Score":"19 out of 20 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  Last orders is a very simple movie.  It is based upon one of cinema's simplest genres The Road Movie.  It is about simple people who lead simple lives wherein very little happens very often.  But behind this simplicity lies the dreams and desires and mistakes and wasted opportunities of these simple people.  Small things (relatively speaking) which would seem to have little consequence on the outside world; but then, we all live in a much smaller world - don't we - and even the tiniest broken dream can sometimes leave us empty - if only for a moment.  This is a film then about people.  About how people view each other.  About how people can harbour the most powerful emotions or secrets - or both - without even those closest to them having the faintest idea.  About the importance of friendship and the universality of loss innocence as well as bereavement.So four simple folk take the ashes of their old mate to be scattered into the sea at faded old, lost innocence Margate.  While the deceased's wife - avoiding this trip - visits their estranged, handicapped daughter for the final time.  We see how they relate (and related) to their old, dead friend and to each other.  We see that great tragedy need not be about 'great' people.  We see that pure love need not derive from 'pure' people.  We see that life and living and loving are as difficult (and as inspirational) for the simplest of folk.  And we celebrate this empathy.Last Orders is a slow burning film with an occasionally awkward script and a potentially confusing narrative.  But for all that, it is a fine, frequently moving, honest piece of cinema.  The photography is consistently evocative; the acting is impeccable (Winstone impresses as the stoic son; Hemmings crackles as the bludgeoning, second rate pugilist) and several set pieces are profoundly sincere (the scene in the field is electric); but this is not a film that exists to shine incandescently - only to burn, quietly and slowly, until it says what it has to and the fuse runs out.  It's worth staying with because, as simple as these people are, if they can't tell you a little something about the sadness and joy and - above all - the wonderful uncertainty of life... then you're probably already dead.

An ensemble that meshes so well that I was drawn into the screen barely conscious of their real identities and filmography,  the story of the long ride of a man's cremated ashes to his selected disposal site, Margate (of all places - garish, timeworn, solidly tired) is gripping.Through flashbacks to events both recent and as far back as combat in the North African desert in World War II the story of three close friends, the wife of one and their son (and peripherally but not insignificantly their catastrophically mentally retarded daughter) reflects the daily small joys and not great setbacks of very average English people.  All the characters here could well be neighbors of the folks in The Full Monty, people whose days are locally if unspectacularly productive and whose pleasures center in daily convivial meetings at the local pub.Jack (Michael Caine) faces death more bravely and honestly than he ever did his total rejection of his and his wife's (Helen Mirren) daughter.  His disappointment at his son's refusal to join him in the butcher business has been the lot of many.  An American version of this tragic rejection would have the son spurn the family business for acting or law or medicine or the Presidency.  Jack's son is quite happy to sell cars.  A nice touch of English class reality.Jack's ashes make a number of detours enroute to Margate while his widow pursues her own very necessary and moving journey to personal closure and the prospect of future happiness.  At each stop the relations between the four men in the borrowed Mercedes become more interwoven, detailed and - ultimately - important for each as their mission nears accomplishment.The direction is superb as is the muted, sometimes hazy cinematography. Unfortunately, as is so often the case with even the best cast portraying non-Oxbridge types, some speech is indecipherable. Ray Winstone is the chief malefactor in the mumbles competition but his acting is convincing - a fine actor from whom much can be expected.  An elderly woman leaving the theater near me remarked, This wasn't about a Gosford Park - the film needed subtitles.  Yes, we have our class consciousness on the Upper West Side too.This is a very special film that deserves the widest distribution.  It won't get it though, not here.

It is not a film that will appeal to the under-25 demographic, but I enjoyed it. the more I thought about the film afterwards, the more impressed I was with it. It might appear that the film is about the end of life, but it is not depressing and it ends, even as those ashes are tipped into the wind and rain, remarkably upbeat, emotionally.The film tells the story of Jack and his friends and family in flashback. From these we gain insights into their characters and relationships and come to understand how their stories lead them to the present day.In some sense this is a mystery, as there are several intertwined stories that are slowly revealed by the flashbacks. In addition, the flashbacks don't follow strict chronological order, so it is a matter of piecing them together to make sense of everything. I liked the effect of the flashbacks slowly revealing the characters' stories, as it is very much like real life. You meet someone you nothing about, but over time you learn something of their past from random fragments of information that are let drop.The movie mostly rings true, but there are several minor episodes that seem contrived. For example, Ray denies knowing anything about a certain sum of money. The only reason for him to do so is that the audience did not yet know the end of that particular story.Jack is played as an old man by Michael Caine. A striking piece of casting is JJ Feild, who plays Jack as a young man. He looks exactly as I imagine Caine would have as a young man.The story reveals a period of more than 50 years. If it had been told in chronological order, it would have been, like so many sagas, fragmentary and it would not have worked. Instead the film takes place over the course of a single day, which gives it coherence, with the flashbacks providing richness and depth.This is a subtle portrayal of Jack and his friends that is deeply satisfying.

The film begins with an assemblage of friends at a local pub to drink a round to one of their own who passed on.  The deceased, Jack (played with appreciable understatement by Michael Caine), gives his friends a posthumous last order to scatter his ashes off the pier at the British seaside resort town of Margate.  The film then proceeds to follow Jack's friends (accessibly played by Tom Courtnay, David Hemmings and the ever-delightful Bob Hoskins), his son (Ray Winstone in an appropriately sleazy and sympathetic role) and his widow (a reflective and heart-rending Helen Mirren) as they seek to carry out his last orders while remembering him and the times they shared. Director Fred Schepisi presents the story of their lives together, both the good and the less-than-stellar, in a series of present-day segments and recent and distant-past flashbacks.  Given frequent horrible examples in too many recent films, a film relying heavily on flashbacks has the potential to easily become distracting, confusing, or both.  Schepisi demonstrates his skill as he guides this technique with a light, deft touch that keeps the viewer connected with events and maintains a story flow that entices rather than confuses.  The life-long camaraderie of the friends, the tensions between them in times of crisis, the father-son struggles between town butcher Jack and his financially ambitious son Vince all play out against the backdrop of a working class environment that many viewers will recognize and even identify with their own lives.It is safe to say that this film is touching without being maudlin.  The restraint shown by both cast and director coupled with the obvious comfort and pleasure of the cast in working with one another lends an air of authenticity to the characters and to the story as a whole that will make all but the most detached viewer think about the course of their own lives. It is this inspiration of reflection on one's life as compared to those shown on the screen that ultimately makes this one of the better films offered to the public in recent years.  Anyone who wants to understand what true friendship can mean should see this film and be inspired by it.  It is too bad that films of this superior calibre are rapidly becoming the exception rather than the rule in film making.

None of the characters are clichÃ©d, and all are likable to some extent - we can see how events of the past have made them what they now are.Shamefully put into cinemas on a limited distribution, 'Last Orders' got a new lease of life when it became a free giveaway DVD in a UK newspaper, which meant it was potentially available to a wider audience (which makes me question whether in fact the use of these promotions could be to let films which quickly left cinemas be widely viewed).

The screenplay's greatest alteration is in filling out her character and it also happens to be one of the film's greatest assets.

These Last Orders are to scatter his ashes from the end of Margate Pier, the place that he was planning to live in retirement (Margate, not the end of the pier!).As the film gets underway, the past histories of the main characters unfold, from how Jack first met Amy (played in later years by the superb Helen Mirren, looking more than her age for once), to the relationship that was, between Jack and his son Vince (Ray Winston).The story was not the fastest of moving, but you had to stay alert to keep up with the many different eras that were depicted through the flashbacks in no chronological order.Despite this, there was no confusion, and with a superb ensemble present, a clever story was conveyed well on to the screen.Not a film for someone expecting an all-out, action packed, escapism adventure but a must see for those wanting a meaningful storyline.

She endures the first birth of a retarded daughter to whom she alone remains devoted while her husband ignores the girl & pays attention to his adopted son Vince (excellent portrayal by Ray Winstone of Sexy Beast fame). Vince refuses to follow his father into the butcher business (it's all about waste) and instead follows his own passion for cars, opening a successful car dealership.The movie is full of marvelous male dialogue (listen hard, these are British accents after all) between Jack's pals heard while they ride around the bluesy and blowsy British coast in Vince's Mercedes,stopping in pubs while headed to spread Jack's ashes to a seaside resort his Last Orders, and a place where he honeymooned with his wife and was happy so many years ago.These men's lives are are told to us through flashbacks of wartime friendships and present-day tales stories of what they have been through in a lifetime of marraiges, divorces, dissapointment, fights and ultimately love.Excellent performances from the all-Brit ensemble cast.

What we have is an honest portrayal of friendship, the ups & the downs as three mates & a son travel to Margate with the ashes of butcher Jack Dodds. But this is more than a physical journey as throughout the day buried secrets, regrets & grievances emerge. These are all superbly told in flashbacks that throw new light onto this circle of friends, part of a dying breed, the working class that lived & fought through wartime & followed their fathers into the family trade.All the actors here are of course superb with Helen Mirren outstanding as the grieving wife, in a very male-orientated tale. The younger cast playing the youthful, idealistic friends equip themselves well never falling into the trap of simply impersonating the elder thespians. Their present day counterparts Caine, Courtenay and Hemmings bring to the screen the same intensity & honesty of performance which must have inspired the likes of Hoskins & Winstone to act & they too give outstanding examples that British acting does not have to involve gangsters or cartoon bad guys in the latest Hollywood blockbuster. This film is the stuff of true sentiment rather than the artificial sentimentality so often present in Hollywood cinema & every father or son can watch & find some small reflection of their own regrets & joys, lovingly & honestly brought to the screen.

The title is what a British pub does right before it closes for the evening, making a call for last orders. But in this story it is also represents the last request of a dying man (Michael Caine).  He asks that his ashes be scattered at a particular seaside town.some SPOILERS followSince he dies very early in the story, much is told in a series of brief flashbacks - how he met his wife, how their only daughter was conceived, how he met his drinking buddies in the war, how his only son was adopted, the survivor of a wartime accident which burned his home and killed his parents. One of his friends drinks too much, another plays the horses too much, one becomes an undertaker ('never out of work!')  The charm of the film is how all the old buddies, and son, make the trip to the seaside resort town ('time to stop for another pint?'). The flashbacks very gradually fill in the gaps of the past story, and by the end we know everything we need to know, including what happened to the L33,000 that Raysey won to help his dying friend settle old debts. The film is perfectly cast, acted, directed, and edited. For me it was almost like being back in England. I saw it on DVD, and any non-Brit would do well to view it with English subtitles turned on. It is almost impossible to understand everything by just trying to understand what the characters say. The  picture is good, as is the sound, but there aren't any interesting extras.

The film is weighty in places, but is rescued by the quality of the cast. Caine needs no introduction of course, but his presence in the movie is almost ever-present, even in scenes he is not in - mirroring the fact that on the Margate trip he is nothing more than an urnful of ashes. David Hemmings is also on top form, but for me Bob Hoskins steals the show, as the horse racing expert with a kind heart who harbours a guilty secret that torments him following Jack's death. Helen Mirren is also wonderful, and underplays her role as Jack's widow with typical aplomb. Perhaps Tom Courtenay and certainly Ray Winstone are a little underused, but as a study in long term friendship and how life can either humble us or mould us, this film is a moving and well made effort from all concerned.

Not just ones that we occasionally see on the weekends, but those that buy you a round when they know you are blue, those that have lived their life right next to yours, those that will not quit even when you want them to forget about you &#150; those are the friends that remain constantly in your mind. In Last Orders we have a unique opportunity to see a group of four friends escape their lives to take one of their greatest friends (and family) to his final resting place. Using a flashback technique that teeters on confusing at times, we witness six of our greatest actors dive deep into the hearts and souls of the characters they are portraying. For once, in cinematic history, we see a story unfold that each and every one of the actors support, as well as contributes more than 100% to their respected roles. This isn't a perfect film, but the flaws are overshadowed by the actors. Each and every one of the actors in this film carried their weight (and then some) as we felt our heartstrings pulled and friendship refreshed.As already mentioned, the acting in this film is superb. It reminds me of discovering that perfect bottle of wine &#150; all the characteristics of the blend are working in unison, creating a masterpiece out of what would be nothing more than than just your standard bottle of grapes. The core of this film is bland. Last Orders will not impress you with phenomenal storytelling or scenes that will demand your full attention &#150; in fact &#150; if it weren't for the actors who took their subsequent roles in this film &#150; I probably would have fallen asleep shortly after the credits. Last Orders is a dry film. There is no denying that, but what sets the bar are the actors. Michael Caine and Bob Hoskins give the performances of their careers in this little independent film that should have seen more attention.. Helen Mirren continues to prove that she is one of those diamonds in the rough when it comes to small roles. She can handle either the big stuff or the small stuff, she continues to give her full ability each time. The rest of the cast, Tom Courtenay and David Hemmings, make this group of friends even more thoughtful. Then, there is Ray Winstone. I have always appreciated his work since seeing him in Sexy Beast, and this film just brought him to a whole new appreciative level. He works, along with the rest of the players in this film, to ensure that their heart and minds are diving their characters into our hearts. It is amazing that even with a weak script, this film was made better by those involved both behind the camera and in front of it.With this applause for the actors, of which I can continue, but would sound like a repetitive critic, I must say that I wasn't impressed with the story. I thought that director Fred Schepisi did a decent job with the imagery, long viewing landscapes accompanying our lush actors, but this story was a challenge to create as a screen writer. Throughout his commentary, he talks about how he felt he had to guide the audience better through the flashbacks &#150; there were quite a bit of them &#150; but without giving us the proper guidance, we just jumped. That was tough because we weren't fully introduced to the younger version of the characters with the respect that we were with the older generation. At times we jumped with no reason, coupling our minds to be both confused as well as needing immediate readjustment to the situation. One moment we were in a Mercedes driving, the next we were in a doctor's bed, the following we were in a war scene. For the casual viewer, this would have been a difficult transition to follow. For me, the jumps seemed too sporadic, too forced to push the story. Unlike the book, each chapter isn't dedicated to each character, we must juggle the time, and I think Schepisi could have accomplished this task better. He picked the right actors to play younger versions of their subsequent actors, but it took some time to make sure that we, the audience, knew who we were working with. It was a struggle for this film, and it nearly &#150; for me &#150; took away from the phenomenal-ness of the actors.There were other issues with this film with continuity and placement, some of which are typical in any budget of a film, but others occurred due in part to the constant change of time. It is hard to change time as often as Schepisi does without missing some details, and again, it distracted in this film. The pacing seemed lacking, I don't remember the book being as dull in some points, but I think it was because Schepisi didn't want to overload us with so much information. The scene with the actors in the Mercedes as they drive to their friend's final destination was beautifully framed, amazingly acted, but seemed extended, dull, and a bit drawn out. That, for me, best summarizes this film. Acting and vision were impressively intense, but the film seemed to slip because of structural issues.Overall, I liked this film, but could not say that I loved it. I will stand behind Last Orders as a film that boasts the best acting from some of our most unique actors, but Schepisi could have done a better job behind the camera. If it weren't for the actors, this film would have drastically fallen. I am glad that our director pushed for great actors, but I think it is in part because he knew the story wasn't as strong as he wanted. This was no Six Degrees of Separation or Roxanne, it stands on its own &#150; it just isn't sturdy enough.Grade *** out of ***** "},{"Title":"Pleasant little movie.","Date":"12 June 2007","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" It's a typical light-heavy movie, if you know what I mean. It's a movie that's heavy on its subjects but gets always told in a light and somewhat fun way. Typically British. It makes the movie at all times a pleasant one to watch.The movie has an original way of storytelling, with the use of flashbacks. The flashbacks are however not always told in chronological way, which should had strengthened the story but it just doesn't do this and the leaps in time just get a tad bit overdone. I mean, not every flashback really serves a significant enough purpose, other than making the movie more melodramatic, which in return doesn't make this movie the most believable or realistic one around.The main plot line is good and simple on its own, so it's too bad that the movie feels the need to put in more story lines to make the movie even more dramatic. The movie just didn't needed that. The movie now often feels more like a soap-opera than a honest realistic drama.But all this negativity aside, this is a perfectly watchable movie.The movie is told slowly in a pleasant pace. The dialog and characters are kept as realistic as possible but it's also most definitely due to the fine actors that the characters of the movie work out so well as they did. It's a real character movie.The Michael Caine character is only featured in the flashbacks of the movie but yet due to the way the story is told, he becomes the central character of the movie. Basically he once more plays his Alfie role again but who complains about it? All of the other actors certainly aren't the least in their business. Oscar-winner Helen Mirren shows her versatility as an actress. Bob Hoskins also plays a good humble role and so does Ray Winstone, whose career really took off the last couple of years. The movie is nicely shot with some good looking locations. It's really English all, as is the overall cultural atmosphere of the movie.

But for the adventurous souls who dare to dine here, Last Orders is a feast. The cast gives lessons in the art of screen acting, and the director shows us how simply and effectively flashbacks can tell a story. The working-class, British accents sometimes render the dialogue unintelligible to American ears, and the jokes are sometimes obscure, but the feelings are always genuine, and the sense of lives lived, in youth and in old age, always rings true.

Last Orders is one of those films that covers a lot of ground in a two hour timeframe; it's sort of what Forrest Gump would have been like if Forrest Gump had had masses of friends and buddies to hang around with as his own life unfolded. But don't think I'm comparing films here because whilst Last Orders is great in its own retrospect, Forrest Gump remains the pinnacle of this sort of genre.I suppose Last Orders is to 'death' as Reservoir Dogs is to 'heist'. The idea that you get a load of male characters (although Helen Mirren's Amy plays a sort of important role); have them situated close to all but one place for the past tense scenes but now and again, showing the repercussions of said death/heist event in the present tense. While Reservoir Dogs' flashback scenes covered a whole range of locations, Last Orders fixes on a public house for the scenes in which all the characters are together but in order to understand more and more about them the film delves deeper into the past; much like Reservoir Dogs did with the Mr. Orange character &#150; showing us how the development of friendship and trust became apparent. Added to this, Last Orders in the present tense beds down in one locale; a moving vehicle as they travel to a pier in order to carry out the dead man's final wish &#150; parallels to Reservoir Dogs and the warehouse can be made here where, arguably, the most intense moments of clashing egos and best examples of dialogue float to the surface.But Last Orders isn't trying to be Forrest Gump or Reservoir Dogs, in my opinion two of the 1990s greatest films. No, Last Orders is a different beast; a tale of friendship and life that is pushed to an apparent breaking point even when the man has gone. It seems funny how with a cast like Hoskins, Caine, Mirren, Hemmings and Winstone one can be so easily attracted to the actors and actresses who play the characters in decades gone by. JJ Field does a superb job as a young Jack (Caine) as does Kelly Reilly with Amy (Mirren); what's more, there is an added sense of nostalgia when Anatol Yusef portrays a young Ray (Hoskins) when really it seems like he is playing Hoskins himself from times gone by &#150; you cannot help but smirk in appreciation. Even though the film plays out with one of its main characters actually dead throughout the entire piece, what makes Last Orders so successful? Well, it gets across a feeling of nostalgia; a feeling of time gone by. Secondly, it gives us these characters who we have seen many times before in films of a different genre; maybe even on a television drama if you're from Britain but it injects heart and soul into any usual stereotypes you might have expected.In order to break away from tired clichÃ©s or familiar archetypes, Last Orders develops almost all of its characters through out their respective lives. There are instances when Ray is tempted to engage in an affair with Jack's wife Amy; there are other instances that seem almost irrelevant Ray's daughter marrying an Australian and moving away and Jack's son Vince wanting to follow a path in the mechanical trade rather than the butcher trade. Although these seem like mere formalities, they are actually extremely important plot points in these respective people's lives with the genius of it to follow they all deal with loss of some sort. If Ray and Amy have an affair, Jack looses out; if Vince wants to become a mechanic against his fathers wishes then the '& sons' tag to the business is rendered false; if Ray's daughter wants to marry and move to the other side of the world, Ray and his wife loose their daughter on a certain level. But one persons loss is another persons gain Ray's daughter has found love; Vince has found a career he loves and Ray has found love to a certain degree with Amy, even if it is at a friend's expense. This is where the film's main level of loss is challenged When it is made apparent after five minutes it is the character of Jack that is dead, nobody wins but everybody looses. Thus, the ensuing road trip is everybody banded together to deal with the event.With the film's theme and consensus loss, it is no surprise tiny references are made apparent all the way through the journey. The lads visit a war memorial in a park to celebrate the 'loss' of life in the war; when walking through the cathedral, Vince talks about how interesting it is to have all the 'dead' kings and queens 'buried' in amongst the walls; there is even mention of the ancient Egyptian pharaohs &#150; harking back to times of old and great people who are now dead, echoing Jack and his life. Even stranger, what do we learn ourselves about Jack during the film? He is a womaniser who seemed carefree and outlandish; a man who wanted his son to do what he did and got angry when he didn't but despite Jack seeming like the least likable person of the group of lads, it is his death that has brought everyone together in a celebration of life above all other things. Last Orders is clever and engaging with a narrative that will entertain and may well have even pulled at some emotional strings by the time the obligatory scene arrives &#150; that itself is an achievement.

"},{"Title":"Ordinary lives, extraordinary movie","Date":"19 August 2002","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" This movie opens with three very profane old British farts communing morosely over their pints at the Coach and Horses in Bermondsey (near Tower Bridge, London) and reminiscing about a mutual friend who has just died. The trailer with this scene in it put me off altogether, and it was only because a workmate raved over 'Last Orders' that I decided to see the film. In fact it is a cleverly made celebration of the lives of ordinary people with about as profound an emotion as the Cinema can evoke in its viewers.Jack (Michael Caine), Ray (Bob Hoskins), Vic (Tom Courtney) and Lenny (David Hemmings) are the old farts, and Helen Mirren is Michael's wife Amy. At the opening of the movie, Jack, a founder member of the Jolly Butcher school has just succumbed to heart disease, and the survivors have undertaken to carry out his last wish to have his ashes cast into the sea at Margate, a windswept seaside resort about 60 miles away. Jack's son Vince (Ray Winstone) who is in the motor trade has laid on a large Mercedes for the occasion, and they all set off, except for Amy who has other family business to attend to.What we then get is the story of the group via a cleverly arranged series of flashbacks, commencing just prior to the Second World War. The tale is an ordinary one but one with which millions of older Brits would empathise with. There are several different strands in the narrative and as younger actors are used in some of the flashback scenes it becomes difficult to recognise characters at first (though in David Hemmings' case things were made easier by casting his son Nolan). JJ Fields is a standout as the young Jack. Some characters (eg Vince) are portrayed by up to four different actors. A second viewing is called for, I think. It helps if you are familiar with British cars; each period seems to be adorned with the appropriate vehicles, including a sixties 'Dormobile' (camper van) which becomes a leit-motiv for the whole story, but I think Fred Schepisi should have stuck the date/place up at the beginning of the flashbacks to help those who are not car buffs.Michael Caine is an amazing actor. He is always the same yet here he fits the character of Jack the butcher perfectly. Caine just gets better with age. Bob Hoskins as Ray the punter and Helen Mirren as Amy are also terrific. Tom Courtenay as Vic the undertaker has a lesser role but is also convincing. David Hemmings as Lenny has not much to work with &#150; he really only has one scene when he tries to punch out Vince in a boggy field - yet he produces a definitive picture of a boozy old man in decline. The old men as a whole evoke pity, but as we delve further into their pasts our pity is replaced by understanding. Every old drunk propping up a corner of the bar has some sort of story to tell, but here Schepisi tells his old fart's stories with humour and compassion. This film is a celebration of the ordinary which shows that even the ordinary have their moments.

But afterwards, one wonders why someone thought following these blokes would be rewarding in some way.The commentary tells us why the director thought so. Most films place us in an artificial world, sometimes artificially constructed to seem real. But there is a philosophy that believes that the direct route to reality is most powerful. In this camp, the ordinary -- if properly shaped -- carries great power. The more ordinary in a sense, the more engaging.For most folks, this isn't true. But it is interesting the tools that this director uses to place our eye in the real. He talks a lot about this in his commentary. Ordinarily, the camera acknowledges the artificiality of the world portrayed by behaving in a way that no ordinary voyeur could. This film is built around two camera perspectives. The first is of four people in a car. As time progresses, the camera inveigles its way into the car as a passenger on the voyage. That's the backbone of the project.The other eye annotates this. It moves back and forth in time, with deliberate equivalence. It also moves between what he calls subjective and objective -- between being in the mind of a character and then shifting to be an observer of the character. Even in the latter case, the camera is at eye height. The reality in which these considerations take place is far more engaging than the reality depicted.Helen Mirren is a redhead here, something which really works for her. I compare her performance here with that of a similarly good wife in `Mosquito Coast.' Better here, in part because of the hair. In a film where performances are supposed to matter, I found the actors playing the young Amy (Mirren) and Jack (Caine) to be the best, most nuanced, most enticing.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4 Has some interesting elements.

The story is a sober but enjoyable one and although the film is maybe a little dull at times, it still manages to be one of reflection and humour that are very well mixed together. Starring such actors as Michael Caine, Helen Mirren, Bob Hoskins and Ray Winstone, this is one film with a real CrÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me of British talent and also one that for some people could be a real highlight.As said I did feel the plot plays out a little boring at moments but it never gets so dragged down in dullness that it becomes bad. The whole tone is never really happy even in the well, happiest of times, something always seems to come a long to make the moment a little sadder and this is one reason I couldn't ever love this film. Having said that all the sadness surrounding the passing of Michael Caine's character Jack and the spreading of his ashes is one of fine characters, each with unique personalities and back stories which interweave into each other's very nicely.I felt of all the acting on show here it is really Helen Mirren who shows off her talent and is just fantastic as Amy(Jack's widow) who is a depressed yet lovable character, caring for her intellectually disabled daughter who has never said a word to her in her life. It is all yet again rather sad but Amy has been created to be just used to it all, even Jack's death we see has bothered but not broken her, she is just a sad person but one who can still have a laugh now and again. Bob Hoskins is good as Ray who is Jack's best mate and he seems to bring a good presence to the screen alongside all the others. One more person to compliment is Ray Winstone as Jack's adopted son Vince, Winstone seems to work the character rather well, blending an honest man with a man who also has demons and anger, brought out a lot by the character of Lenny(David Hemmings).I couldn't help but feel this is a kind of movie that tried to maybe push for awards, and it did work, but maybe not on the level they really wanted. Sure Mirren deserved the credit but as a picture this is nothing special, the kind of movie that is alright don't get me wrong but just not good for numerous reasons. Fred Schepisi is not one of those reasons, I mean I didn't think either his directing or writing were great but importantly they are steady and make the picture one that is a close one, where you connect with the characters, Schepisi really tries to draw you in and make it as if these people are real.I think this movie is the kind of thing that sure, on a quiet Sunday lazing about, this is the kind of thing that may just be very enjoyable. I felt throughout the film goes for the sweet stuff from the first minute with heart and emotion everywhere trying to hit you hard so you too maybe shed a tear. For me this isn't strong enough a movie to make me sad but I do admit there are scenes in it(especially with Mirren in them) that make your heart drop, and the scenes to be fair with her daughter are both heartbreaking but also show us Mirren's complete talent.

The very fact it starred Bob Hoskins and Michael Caine was enough reason to buy it. What I love about this film is the simple story about a group of close friends who have gone through life together as drinking buddies in South London. It resembles so closely the traits, personality and conversations that all of us will recognise. The basic story is Jack (Caine) has requested that his ashes be scattered into the sea off the end of Margate Pier, the story follows the journey made by his best mate Lucky (Hoskins), Lenny and Vic, plus his son Vince (a young looking Ray Winstone). Through numerous flashbacks we build a picture of their lives through the years, highs and lows. Its a lovely film, and to be perfectly honest the ending gave me a lump in my throat.

Fred Schepisi wrote the screenplay for Last Orders (he also is the Director) based on the Booker prize winning novel of the same name by Graham Swift. That is what this film is about - the complexities of people's dealings with each other and dealing with their own thoughts, plans, memories, and regrets.The title refers to a request Jack (double Oscar winner Michael Cain) left for his ashes to be scattered at Margate (a historic British seaside resort). Jack had an outwardly effervescent personality that caused friends he had made in his youth (he came of age just before the start of World War II) to remain life-long friends. Despite the war, in many ways those years of beginning their adult lives were the best in these people's lives. Perhaps that is the case for the majority of people.They had their futures to look forward to. One was a prizefighter who never had more than modest success. Another (the most steadfast of the friends) starts out as a funeral director and that seems to satisfy his desires. Jack, a butcher, inherited his business from his father and always dreamed that his own son would enter the business as well, but that's not what the son wants. He and his wife, Amy (Dame Helen Mirren), also have a mentally defective daughter who has been institutionalized since childhood. One of the significant conflicts is that Jack and Amy have opposite ways of dealing with that tragedy. Amy decides not to accompany the group when they take the ashes to Margate.Ray (Bob Hoskins), who Jack nicknamed Lucky because he pulled Jack into a trench half a second before a bullet would have struck him, owned a motorcar business but is more interested in playing the horses, with which he has had some success. He has a daughter who many years ago moved to distant Australia after falling in love with an Australian of questionable prospects, and they stopped writing years ago. Ray's wife had divorced him after she learned that Ray had assisted the newlyweds financially in their move to Australia.These loves and conflicts are revealed piecemeal via flashbacks as the individuals contemplate, and it is our coming to realize that relationships are more complex than what they seem on the surface.Not only is the screenplay based on a great novel, the cast is an ensemble of some of the most respected British actors, who all are great in their roles. They cast JJ Feild as the youthful Jack, and he strongly resembles Michael Caine in his early films. One warning Some of the British colloquialisms and references may be unfamiliar to an American audience.

Other than the regrettable casting of Kelly Reilly, a good actress, in the roll of the young Amy played by Helen Mirren who looks nothing like Helen Mirren nor has similar body language or general presence to her. However; this one small flaw does not keep this from being a very memorable film experience for the viewer.This well-crafted film has the appeal of being a learning experience as well as one of entertainment. I am a 'baby boomer' and most of us are coming to grips that life is a limited proposition and that the truth of life is that if one has made good friends and brought joy to the lives of others that we have lived a rich and full life and can face death without regret. If you have not seen this film watch it. If you have only seen it once, see it again as the second time viewing is even more rich with new learning and reward.

Warmth, humanity, humor et al. permeate the atmosphere of this realistic, yet sensitive story.To me, Mr. Hoskins' role stands out just a tad from the rest, as he is, in no small part, the main facilitator in this film he always seems to be in the right place at the proper time, especially at the track! Although not in the boys' club of disposing of the ashes, Helen Mirren's role here is more subtle and indirect, yet crucial as the deceased's (Michael Caine) wife who opts not to go along with the boys for the final ride. Her understated yet forceful portrayal here is one of her finer pieces of work, especially noted in her scenes with her mentally challenged daughter. M. Caine is his usual cad self, somewhat like an aged Alfie who likes his bantering with the birds at the pub (and at the hospital!), but unlike Alfie, he won't make plays for them! The rest of the group of the boys carrying out the Last Orders provide more than ample thespian talent, not only in their individual roles, but also in how each relates to the group as a whole. The cast of the flashback scenes of yore does equally well in laying out the dramatic foundation for the modern day sequences.Some say the total is greater than the sum of the individual parts, especially when dealing with the synergy of talents and overall heart as manifested in this production. It's all about heart, baby, and there's plenty here to go around. Cheers!

The film as a whole, however, is less successful than its source. Partly this is because of the difficulty that films have in weaving as seamlessly between the past and the present as books can the movie is always unambiguously in one time or the other, and switching between them, whereas the original could roam as freely as thoughts; perhaps the structure should have been more substantially altered, to make it more suitably cinematic (for example, the story of each man could have been told in succession).

Jack (Michael Caine) dies, leaving behind his childhood friends (Bob Hoskins, David Hemmings and Tom Courtenay), a wife (Helen Mirren) and reserved son (Ray Winstone). His friends and son take his ashes to Margate, a two-hour drive outside of London. Along the way, through flashbacks, we learn of the complex roles that these men have played in each other's lives. Although it is a heartbreaking ride, there is nothing morose about this movie. The old friends argue and tell jokes, remembering Jack in their own unique ways. The common thread being that while they are sad he died, they are even happier that he had lived and graced their lives. The superior acting skills of Hoskins, Hemmings, Courtenay and Winstone rescue the film from director Fred Schepisi's languid direction. Helen Mirren (who doesn't accompany the guys on their ash-scattering mission) shines in her scenes with her hospitalized daughter.

Shame the Yanks struggle so with the accents, pity the cast was so disunited on whether to speak of Margate or Margit.But that disunity reflected something else which jarred with me, and that was the chronology. The characters couldn't agree what year was the present. Maybe in 10 or 20 years time when we get it out on video, dvd, or whatever else we have then, it will all be the old days, but it took me a while to work out that this 2001 film of a 1996 book was actually set in the mid 80s, and indeed appeared unsure of which year it really was meant to be. Am I being too prosaic? It probably wouldn't be so important in a movie that didn't have so many flashbacks, but to try and work out what is going on, it's helpful to be able to mentally anchor events to some sort of rough timeline. They spoke at one point in the present of Vince's 40th birthday, then we saw him being rescued as a baby from a house destroyed by a V1 doodlebug, which places his birth as no later than 1944, and the present therefore being 1984. And of course the hop-picking and June's conception was in the pre-war days of the 30s, and she is now 50, so that also fits with 1984. But didn't Ray talk of Sue having been in Australia for 30 years, and she was in London in the Beatles era, with the (wrong) Yellow Submarine poster. That was made in 1968, so it has to now be 1998!

Or is this the quality of public institutions in England?  One wonders!).   And nothing about Laura Morelli on IMDb or the official web site--is she an actress or an actual autistic person brought in (one might say, exploited) for this role?     The Sony site brings into high relief the additional contrast between four guys in a car having a grand time (both in the film & on the set) while Amy makes her lonely & unfulfilling pilgrimage to the asylum.  At the end, Amy decides to give up on June--the one decision in the movie that seems forced, arbitrary.  If only she'd explained it a little more!

How often to you get to see such great actors on the one screen. I particularly thought that Tom Courtenay was great, though didn't get as much screen time as one would have hoped. Just while I'm on the subject of Courtenay- what on earth did the wardrobe department think they were doing with their wigs. In fairness the wig they gave Bob Hoskins looked very well; but as for the orange wig Michael Caine had and as for poor Tom Courtenay- the guy already has a full head of hair- sticking a dead furry animal on top of his head looked ridiculous!

She defies Hollywood' gilded GenX beauty conventions to deliver a powerful performance sans makeup as her character ages from a natural beauty in her late teens to an aged women in her 60s.Mirren plays Amy, wife of Jack (Caine), a butcher these past 50 years. She endures the first birth of a retarded daughter to whom she alone remains devoted while her husband ignores the girl, who is institutionalized, & lavishes his attention on on his adopted son, Vince (Winstone of Sexy Beast fame). Vince, refusing Jack's wishes to join him in the Dodd & Son butcher shop (it's all about waste) instead follows his own passion for women and cars, opening a car dealership, far eclipsing his father in financial and career success.The movie is full of marvelous male dialogue (seldom heard in action-oriented filmmaking today; listen hard, these are after all, British accents)and fine English countryside and landmarks. Jack's pals talk about their life with him as they visit pub after pub while riding in Vince's Mercedes on the long and quintessential English road to Margate, a coastal amusement park where Jack and Amy honeymooned so many years ago. These are Jack's Last Orders  scatter his ashes in the sea @ Margate where he and Amy were happy so very long ago.The men's lives and friendships are told through flashbacks of wartime exploits, present-day tales and stories of a lifetime of marraiges, divorces, disappointment, fights and ultimately love.Excellent performances from the all-Brit ensemble cast. Bob Hoskins shines in a way we haven't seen him since Mona Lisa as the best friend who saved Jack's life during the war and who has also loved Amy as much as Jack has all these years.

Last Orders presents the perfect compromise between the two, with the prospect of spending two hours in the boozer with Michael Caine, Bob Hoskins, David Hemmings, Ray Winstone and Tom Courtney The story focuses on how a family butcher played by Michael Caine's friends remember him after his death, and through a heavy dose of the tried and tested flashback formula we see his life over a period of 50 years from his youth as a cotton picking Jude Law look-a-like to the old(er) Caine we know and love. through this we see how the relationships between the five friends have developed through affairs, fights, denial, separation and, of course, masses of booze. These recollections are threaded around a journey to scatter his ashes at the pier at Margate. Director Fred Schepsi makes Last Orders a serenely paced affair, with few twists or surprises thrown in across the massive time-span covered. What this allows is a realistic sense of camaraderie between the characters to appear as scenes slowly play out in bars across the years. The meaty British thespian talent on show clearly enjoys the chance to show their chops with a decent script and quality actors to work with. Ray Winstone portrayal of Caine's alienated son allows the actor to show his lesser seen sensitive side, whilst David Hemmings' brandy soaked performance and outlandish eyebrows (you'll swear they are about to crawl off his forehead at any moment) are particularly memorable. More than anything the film has the feel of a distant memory of a particularly drunken evening being retold by a friend. The jokes don't seem quite as funny as they clearly were at the time and the seismic events seem more common place than people's reactions would have indicated. However more than anything a true sense of warmth and compassion comes across, and it is difficult not to empathise with the characters. Last Orders is unlikely to set pulses racing, but the average cinemagoers extreme fondness for the magnificent cast allows it to escape death by dry worthiness and become an enjoyably down to earth pleasure that will leave you sad to be heading home on your own when the projectionist calls last orders and the lights go up. 7/10  "},{"Title":"3 stars","Date":"5 April 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  As the film opens, Jack Dodds (Michael Caine) has died and his ashes are being brought to the pub where he and his friends spent a great deal of time. Jack has made known that he wants his ashes scattered in the water at Margate, and the general structure of the film is his friends and his son Vince (Ray Winstone) on their way there, reminiscing about their lives. Jack's now widow, Amy (Helen Mirren), does not make the trip but is a major character nonetheless. This present day story is intercut with flashbacks of the characters at various stages of their lives, including Jack and Amy's first meeting and scenes from the war, when the characters are played by different actors, and more recent scenes when the same actors (including Caine, who obviously doesn't appear in the present) are seen. The film is comfortable in dealing with the interconnections of life and death and between people, and while there is a surprise or two along the way, the journey seems to be the main point. Of the characters I have not already mentioned, Bob Hoskins as Ray was definitely my favorite. The accents in the film are fairly thick and American viewers will miss some words. It's not bad enough to be a significant issue, but if I were to watch this on DVD I would probably turn on subtitles the first time I watched it.

Last Orders is a great example of the celebration of one man's life, legacy, triumphs and sorrows. Jack (Michael Caine) is very much alive in the memories of his close friends and relations. This neighborhood butcher left behind a son who's charting his own path, a daughter who doesn't know him and a wife who sustained their relationship into their second 50 years and an incredible array of friends with vivid memories.We see Jack's character as a reflection through the eyes of these close friends and we know them by their association with Jack. Though idiosyncratic, this method of storytelling enables the director to meander through middle class Britons from WWII through the new millennium. You won't get a linear view so expect to suspend your rational expectation for chronology for a fascinating trip tied together by nostalgia. The relationship between Ray (Bob Hoskins) and Amy (Helen Mirren) looks back on their fondness for each other and forward to getting on with it. Though Vince's (Ray Winstone) dialect makes me long for subtitles, he effectively straddles the line between his affection for his father and his fiery independence, which prevented their closeness. I could go on but this cast really puts into perspective the level of the (acting) bar in England today. We haven't half-dozen actors in the US today who could do this quite so easily. Bravo.  "},{"Title":"The whole is less than the sum of its parts.","Date":"5 March 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" 	  I've just come back from seeing the highly anticipated Fred Schepisi movie, Last Orders, which I had seen described in the paper as a wake.  I guess sometimes a wake can fall flat.  In fact pretty often they do.  A wake is not necessarily a celebration of the dead person' life.  It may be just a bunch of fragmentary recollections and halfhearted efforts at good cheer. Whatever this movie is, it isn't a celebration of anything, and it isn't cheering or hopeful.	 Parts of this story about a man's death and the mourners who dispose of his ashes were touching, certainly.  As in the great old English films of the past, ensemble work prevails with everyone great, no one dominant.  The deck is loaded with a cast like this.   Helen Mirren and Bob Hoskins and (in his smaller role as the man who's now dead) Michael Caine are of course fine, superb, at their best, their most loveable and human-wonderful, really. Tom Courtenay and David Hemmings are full of assurance.  The younger actors who fill in when wigs and makeup aren't enough to make the flashbacks half credible are energetic and competent.  One has to be particularly taken by the actor, J.J. Feild, who plays the young Caine-a big, pretty fellow, prettier than Caine ever was, with a lot of authority and spirit, though he looks as much like a taller, blonder, spunkier Alec Guinness as like an early Michael Caine. A hops-cutting scene between this young Jack and his wife to be is the sweetest and most magical moment in the whole movie. But I confess to being rather disappointed with all of this, for various reasons, not the least of which is the fact that I found a considerable amount of the dialogue incomprehensible, especially, and crucially, in the movie's major, framing sequence in which the five mourners journey by car taking Jack's ashes to the sea.  Ray Winstone, strong actor though he is (powerful in Nil by Mouth, terrifying in The War Zone) should always be subtitled, at least for non-British viewers.   	 It's a rather down-at-the-mouth kind of story, this Booker-Prize-winner adaptation from Graham Swift's novel, full of little humiliations, especially for Miss Mirren's sad-faced character, like having an institutionalized retarded daughter she must constantly visit, and having a little affair with your husband's best friend, Ray, that quickly has to end, and running short of money (in Jack's case)  just when you're about to die, or (in Ray's case) having your daughter run off to Australia at 18 and stop writing, and then having your wife leave you too. It's also a story constructed out of switches back and forth in time and place and a mosaic of flashbacks.  That may be what appealed to this director about the story, the challenge to put together something effective out of so many disparate pieces.  In this case, however, such construction makes the whole thing complicated but sketchy.  One can never quite figure out what David Hemmings is doing here.  (One also can't figure out how the charismatic young man in Antonioni's Blowup turned into this big blowsy drunk with the Salvador Dali eyebrows.)  It was unclear to me what his occupation in life is meant to have been and what he has to do with the other characters, other than pick fights with them and urge them to drink more at every pub along the way to the ashes-scattering at Margate.  One key episode, the raising of needed money by the dying Jack from his hospital bed through a successful betting on a horse, isn't followed through very decisively, other than to show that the horse won. The tricky problems of reconstructing the book as a movie may have gotten the better of Schepisi here.  When the end came I wasn't 100% sure it was the end, and that's never a good sign.  Fred Schepisi was the master behind Six Degrees of Separation, a movie that's a marvel of adaptation (from John Guare's play) and that sparkles from start to finish.  This one lacks the greatness of which Scepisi is sometimes capable.  Mind you, it's better than watching Lasse Hallstrom, and I feel like a real meanie being lukewarm about a `warm and touching' movie like this one containing such fine actors.  But I have to be honest  I was quite disappointed. This was a difficult work to bring to the screen, but that doesn't make me want to love it, despite the marvelous ensemble cast and a director who's done great things in the past. "},{"Title":"Interesting","Date":"17 January 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  It is a truth universally acknowledged that books that win the Booker Prize tend to be a bit crap.  They tend to be meditations like Graham Swift's Last Orders rather than mind-blowing, eye-popping, genre-busting, era-defining classics like Money and Trainspotting.  They tend to be books that a committee would like.  Or, indeed, that a committee would write.  And so, when it comes to turning them into films (why?) it's not surprising that the result is not really going to set the world on fire. Last Orders is a pleasant enough film, full of fine performances, good cinematography, excellent use of flashbacks (and even flashbacks within flashbacks), but somehow it leaves you thinking So what?.  The plot meanders along nicely enough, filling in details as it goes, revealing secrets and lies along the way. The entire cast acquit themselves admirably, investing every scene with just the right amount of emotion and drama.  But the film is lacking something, and several characters seem irrelevant to it David Hemmings' character in particular.  It's a fine performance by Hemmings (and his eyebrows) but it serves little or no function.  It feels like he's just there to make up the numbers.  Both his big scenes (crying in the Gents and fighting Ray Winstone in the field) are of no use to the plot. There are worse films around at the moment, and you have to give all concerned credit for trying, but this would have worked a lot better as a TV drama, spread over a few nights, giving us more time to get to know the characters and care more about their relationships. Incidentally, for those people who know SE15, the film affords particular pleasures with its cameo appearances by Peckham's Wishing Well pub and the good old Cave of Spirits.

Focusing on the dead man, Jack (Michael Caine), we follow his life mainly though the memories of his wife (Helen Mirren), his best friend Ray (Bob Hoskins)and his son Vince (Ray Winstone). The personalities, histories and inter-relationships of Jack and the others are revealed and examined in detail - warts and all. The overall feel of the film is that lives matter even when they appear inconsequential, and that love and friendships are valuable even if they don't always run smoothly. Much of the film's interest lies in the fine acting of a top quality ensemble which, in addition to those already mentioned includes Tom Courtenay and David Hemmings. One of the problems for the makers of film, and for the audience, is that some of the flashback scenes feature the main characters when they were young adults, who have to be played by young actors. The fact that Caine et al have had such long careers, and we are so familiar with their faces, makes this aspect especially problematic, but the surrogates are generally acceptable, especially J J Feild as the young Jack, and Hemmings' son Nolan as the young version of his role.In relating Jack's history, the film also relates 50 years of British history, and unfortunately there is more than a hint of misty-eyed nostalgia. Many scenes look backward to attractive features of English life that have gone (such as the idyllic Kent hopfields of the 1930s) or remind us of past glories (like the scene in Canterbury Cathedral). I would have welcomed some recognition that the old days had both bad and good sides, and/or that Britain has a vibrant present as well as a glorious past. On the whole, however, the film is more to be seen as a poignant and positive character-driven drama, rather than for any socio-political content.

When Ray laments a life spent meeting in the local pub, 'Coach and Horses', saying it doesn't go anywhere, the feeling of lives dwindling away is tangible.The whole movie is beautifully made, and acted to perfection by an exceptionally well chosen cast. The humour is gentle, the tale told in a refreshingly subdued manner, without any hyperbole. And it is so good to see a British movie with a heart, and no gangsters!

Now, he's going to die. And Amy, his wife is going to have to suffer as a result after Jack carks it.Then, Jack gets this idea. He'll borrow some money from his son, Vince. You see, his son was supposed to take over the butcher shop, but Vince figured (rightly) that there wasn't a future there. Jack cajoled him and begged him to take it over, you know, the old father leaves the son the family business and then becomes the father himself to leave to the son trip. But, that don't wash over time. That was some other time. Perhaps, the last time, it was that time was in the 19th Century.

Vince coughs up some pounds and Jack then asks his old pal Raysie to use his best betting knowledge and put the lot on a long shot horse.

Consequently, the major part of this film is in flashback as four elderly men, all good friends, recall all the memorable times they spent together with their good friend Jack Dodds, the local butcher.  Jack is no more, though his presence is still felt.  His ashes are in a canister no bigger than a tea caddy.  It was jack's dearest wish to have his ashes scattered at Margate, a seaside town he loved.So this film is very much like a road movie as we share their conversation while they speed along the highway to Margate.  And yes, Jack's ashes are with them.The story gets very confusing at times because it deals with two generations and the flashbacks are many, jumping in and out of the picture.  The faces of the five men in the leading roles are matched rather well with those of the younger actors playing those roles in earlier days, but it requires considerable concentration to recognize the characters and their relationship with each other.  One wonders if it is really worth the trouble.Michael Caine as the butcher gives his usual reliable performance as does Helen Mirren and the others, but they are worthy of better material.  I thought the fisticuffs scene was irrelevant and embarrassing to watch.  However, there are some memorable moments.  For example when Ray is overcome with grief and can scarcely contain himself and when Jack's wife Amy informs her handicapped daughter that this is the last visit.

However the plot is what was needed here and it didn't totally do it for me.  The flashback structure had potential and did manage to piece together a reasonably effective picture of Jack's life, but it also had the effect of spreading itself too thin in terms of material.  It didn't grab me and I needed it to be more immediate - however that is me, perhaps if it speaks to you and you are patient then you will be able to get past the weaknesses.  However, for me, the film never really managed to do what it was aiming to do.The characters are not as strong as I had expected and too many of them are not given skin on their bones.  Jack is obviously the strongest character and it is the painting of his story that kept me watching.  The downside of this is that it does it in a disjointed fashion - a fashion that seemed to detract from the character tale it was trying to do.  Caine is good nevertheless as an ordinary man, but it is not one of his better performances.  Hoskins is better and he almost acts as an unofficial narrator on the tale.  Support from Winstone and Mirren is just as good and the feel is of a great cast and material that had unfulfilled potential.That said, it is worth a watch once.  The cast and the fact that the film is an OK character piece both mean I was glad I gave it a shot, it's just a shame that it didn't manage to really deliver on it's potential.

I will not repeat in this limited space what is already well said elsewhere.Warning Any review good enough to guide, will ruin some of the surprise.Last Orders is the kind of movie that would be beloved by the film as literature crowd, and resented by those people who took film as literature in order to get out of real work.The most obvious quality of the film is that it is an English movie without being an English language movie.  This quality will surprise those people who think they know English dialects because they watch the BBC. Watching East Enders is not adequate preparation. A consequence of this quality is that this movie is not Hollywood style commercial, it is an art house movie done to commercial production standards.The commercial production values of the movie will confuse the unwary. Because there is struggle against the elements, one might think this movie was about man against nature; its not. Likewise, there is action in the movie, but it is not an action movie.  Gradually, the unwary will recognize that the movie is a psychological drama set in a difficult social setting.The difficult social setting brings up issues that may be unspeakable in some personal societies. The road trip starts in central London; it is not about either the East Enders or the West Enders.  It is about people who live at the pivot point, and must make difficult choices.  For example, is an increase in pay and status worth a cut in the quality of life? Is respect an adequate substitute for acceptance? Is independence worth poverty? Does love truly conquer all? Last Orders has both a drinking association and a military association.Watching difficult choices play out makes parts of the movie seem like a slow motion blend of heroism and horror; there is a temptation to turn away. But you are doomed if you do; because every frame matters. Too much beloved book is trying to fit into too little picture show. Furthermore, one of the techniques used to mitigate the horror, promotes confusion.  About a third of the movie is told in flash back.An inspiring theme of the movie is that ordinary people can have greatness in their life too.  Some of their life is the stuff of myth and legend. For example, the struggle between Jack and Amy echoes the conflict between Gaia and Uranus (Greek Mythology).There are three seemingly pointless detours to a church, a war memorial, and a farm. But as Shakespeare might say - the heart has reasons that the mind has no knowledge of.  A trip to the Final Destination naturally includes detours to the Sacred, the Profane, and to Mother Earth - the beginning and end of all of us.The promotional picture on the cover box for the movie shows boozy, happy people. Given the previous body of work of the stars, it is not unreasonable to expect the movie to be the moral equivalent of pain killers. But its not; its more like a bottle of vitamins; its bitterness is good for you. Love your vitamins; love this movie.It is difficult to complain in public about vitamins, but one can damn something with faint praise.But what would Jack say?  What would be his last comment? I can imagine Jack saying - You're old enough to know you shouldn't judge a movie by its cover. Besides, its all a crap shoot anyway.

And theimage of the nearly gen-x Winstone surlily holding his own, andthen some, with the bright lights of the angry-young-man era. Andmaybe just seeing Hoskins play such a diminuendo'd,  unaggressive, normal-life-loving guy--an absolute first in thegallery of Hoskins little people. The real pleasure to be had,though, is in the director Fred Schepisi's handling of the material.A perennial first-choice of post-Kael critics in the United States,Schepisi reveals that he actually is as good as they say he is. Hiselegant widescreen compositions, and his collaboration with thecomposer in particular, reveal an oft-forgotten mastery. Memo toHarvey Weinstein Take away some of Lasse Hallstrom's gigs andgive them to Schepisi.

His three closest friends travel down to Margate to scatter his ashes and recount the old times and face some shattering truths. Juxtaposed with this story, Ray (Bob Hoskins), one of the friends, talks with Jack's wife (Helen Mirren) with whom he also had an affair of his own.This is actually a pretty good idea for a film. It's well casted, too, with real-life cockney old-timers Caine and Hoskins making for a very interesting pairing, as well as the supporting cast in the shape of Tom Courtenay, David Hemmings and Ray Winstone as Jack's illegitimate son. And to start off with, it certainly seems like it's going to be a nice, sentimental sort of film that shouldn't be very hard to get in to. All the complications and revelations are very interesting to watch unfold as well. But, there's something with the pacing that just feels a bit wrong, and towards the end you can't help but feel it's droning on a little bit. ** "},{"Title":"Last Orders","Date":"3 November 2006","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" From Fred Schepisi, director of Roxanne and Fierce Creatures, this is quite a good drama. Basically it is all about the friends of Jack Dodds who have been given the difficult last orders of scattering his ashes to the sea. These friends, Vic Tucker (Tom Courtenay), Lenny 'Len' (David Hemmings), Ray 'Raysie' Johnson (Bob Hoskins) and (I think) Vince 'Vincey' Dodds (Ray Winstone) on the journey remember the good times with their friend as butcher and pub mate. Sir Michael Caine as Jack in the flashbacks is the nice guy with a good personality. I cannot remember much of what happens, besides the scattering, and the fact that Caine and Hoskins are in it, but it is definitely worth seeing. Also starring Dame Helen Mirren as Amy Dodds. Good!

After all, Fred Schepisi has proven to be a dependable director with a reasonable track record, and the cast included some of the biggest talents to be produced in British cinema in the last forty years. I left the cinema mortified that such talent could have been so indulgently wasted. I also questioned the validity of the Booker Prize. After all, Graham Swift's winning novel was the source of this 2 hour long tedious ordeal of a movie. The themes of old age regret and retrospection have been done very well in the past. Wild Strawberries and The Straight Story come to mind. However, whilst Victor SjÃ¶strÃ¶m and Richard Farnsworth respectively showed great empathy with their characters, Last Orders comes off like a cynical ensemble piece. Especially guilty was Helen Mirren, possibly the most overrated British actress of our generation, and seemingly beyond reproach. She simply moped around the screen like a sulking child. Ray Winstone showed yet again that he has the acting range of an electric toothbrush. Bob Hoskins was the sole redeeming feature, but he alone could neither rescue proceedings nor prevent me walking out of the first film since Lethal Weapon 4. Truly Awful.

The script  has an awkward theatricality that just doesn't ring true for characters living in Bermondsey.  And Helen Mirren -though terrific- is painfully miscast as a woman nearing 70 (!); even sticking an old lady hat on her head for a few scenes didn't convince me. The whole film has difficulty pulling its disparate elements together and ends up being messy rather than haunting and thoughtful. Still, on the plus side it is good to see a film about older people rather than a bunch of tanned, perfect toothed under 30's; shame then that it is a failure "},{"Title":"Not my cup of tea or should that be Rosie Lee?","Date":"21 June 2007","Score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Americans will be pleased to hear that they are now incorporating subtitles on remote controls so that they can understand films like this which they perceive to be in a foreign language. Strange how the English never need subtitles apart from when Marlon Brando or Sylvester Stallone are on screen. The film was spoilt for me by the ridiculous toupee worn by Bob Hoskins (probably hired from Tony Bennett), the immense eyebrows of David Hemmings (The film's budget didn't run to a pair of garden shears to cut them) and the fact that professional Cockney Ray Winstone was once again playing professional Cockney Ray Winstone. Add the fact that Michael Caine was once again playing Michael Caine, I felt somewhat unfulfilled by this film despite all the gushing praise lavished on it on the preceding pages. I am not alone in my not liking of this film as someone at my office today on responding to my query about whether he had seen this said quote, Yeah, bleedin' miserable rubbish.

I wasn't because there's very little in the way of plot , with much of the story being told in flash back but don't expect anything resembling PULP FICTION or MEMENTO because this is just about as low concept as a movie can get , if you're able to get to the end credits without nodding off you have done very well . Perhaps your idea of extreme sports is watching paint dry ?The more I think about it the more I'm disappointed with it . Look we've got Michael Caine , Helen Mirren , Bob Hoskins and Ray Winstone in the same movie and little happens . Wouldn't have been much better if Hoskins and Mirren were getting bothered by the IRA trying to muscle into their patch so they hire Caine as an assassin who gets jailed for throwing a man off a tower block and he has to pay protection money to Winstone who rules the prison wing .

The otherwise excellent actors were challenged by the weak, insubstantial script, so how could they be expected to perform well? The only good thing about the movie was the cinematography of the 40s flashback scenes the color was warm, cozy, lush, and beautiful with just the right amount of softness that gave the immediate signal--even before you note the hairstyles and clothing--that the 40s were being depicted. I have to credit the actors who played the characters in the 40s flashbacks- they managed to make something out of the poor script, God only knows how. "}]
