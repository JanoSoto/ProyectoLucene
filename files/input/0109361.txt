Chris Elliot proves he is the master of absurd comedy in this one of a kind, off the wall masterpiece! I'm almost ashamed to love it so dearly. The movie propels itself through a bizarre mythological backdrop using Elliots uncanny knack for brilliant, stupid, amazingly funny dialog and antics. Cabin boy stays true to all that is Elliot from beginning to end. It doesn't change its mind halfway through, and is too unassuming to attempt to deliver any heartwarming morally relevant conclusion. Chris Elliot's antihero is so lovably hate able that you feel the desire to both punch him in the face, and gently rock him to sleep in a comfy blanket. This comedy is probably not for everyone, but the payoff for those who understand its naive, cynical hilarity is worth the rental fee. Hell, you can buy it for under six bucks almost any where. It is truly a misunderstood work of pure cinematic bliss.

People should just lighten up and realize that this movie is brilliant. Come on. True I do like this movie a lot because of scenes that are actually in Get A Life, Chris Elliot's TV show.

That being said, you will not, I'm sure, misunderstand my assertion that this film is not for everyone. Perhaps it is not even for you. As you see, it has received paltry scores from the greatest part of the spectating crowds who vote on IMDb.com; but should one follow them? They have also selected such trash as Donnie Darko for placement among their trophy shelf of film. I reaffirm therefore the peculiar genial and aesthetic disposition requisite fully to enjoy Cabin Boy. It is as though one must become dumb and wise at the same time, one must see with the eyes of a fool and the heart of a sage. The film student, who possesses in varied solution this talent, will also notice how exquisite, how carefully adorned the sets are, how precise the sceneries, how composed the artful tableaux, how peerless and true the cast, how poetic each word spoken.

Personally this movie fits my style of comedy perfectly. I love non-sequiturs, absurdity, and characters who are insanely quirky. Chris Elliot, as another reviewer pointed out, seems to have been ahead of his time. The style of comedy he honed on the Letterman show and the Get a Life sitcom was pure absurdist brilliance, and it shines through in this movie.A few of my favorite quotes from the movie (and I'm going mostly from memory here)`Half man plus half shark equals one complete gentleman.' (Nathaniel)`I'm sorry, I was just thinking how much fun it is to roast pumpkin seeds.' (Nathaniel)`Gum.' (Kenny)`Would you like to buy a monkey?' (Dave)`Well. thanks for that. whatever that was.' (Nathaniel)`I'm drawn to you, even though you have the breeding of a carnival barker.' (Nathaniel)`I just don't get it! She seems totally uninterested in me, despite my smothering obsessiveness!' (Nathaniel)`Oddly enough, it kind of tastes like marzipan!' (Nathaniel)Nathaniel `I love sitting up here, looking at those bright, twinkly things in the sky, I forget their technical name.' Trina `Stars.' Nathaniel `Whatever.'How can anyone not love these lines? Ah, diff'rent strokes, I guess. Another favorite scene of mine is when Cappy goes to sleep nestled up to Chris and they wake up in each other's arms the following morning. Just the expression on Chris' face while sleeping is so glorious.All the complaints I've seen about Elliot's demeanor indicate to me that people have completely missed the point. They talk about how annoying and whiny he is, but that's the whole point of his character in this film a rich snotty kid who is forced to endure the antics of those from the less privileged caste (but who are no less intellectually challenged, natch).I typically don't like comedy movies, because they're just way too formulaic and rigid--I tend to prefer sketch comedy or stand-up/improvisation. But with this movie, I can't stop laughing. I'm always eager to see where Chris Elliot will pop up next, and sadly it's been too long. But As Nathaniel one said to Chocky, I shan't forget you!

The film is just plain odd from beginning to end.  Whoever thought this stuff up (I guess that would be Adam Resnick and Chris Elliot) has quite an imagination.  As far as the comedy goes, it's actually pretty funny most of the time.  I don't think I ever found myself really busting up, but I did laugh quite a few times.  If you liked Chris Elliott's comedy from Saturday Night Live, than I would hope that you find this film funny.The cast was pretty good, nothing much to complain about there.  Chris Elliott did a good job with his role, pretty darn good for a first starring role.  All of the shipmate characters were very well done and fun to watch.  Melora Walters was personal fav of mine.  I don't think I've ever seen her in anything else, but she looks absolutely fantastic in this film.  Ricki Lake was an odd character/actor in the film.  Her character was beyond strange, and the fact that the character was played by Ricki Lake just makes it even stranger.  I also liked the fairly small role played by Mike Starr.  Another high point for me was seeing Andy Richter from Late Night with Conan O'Brien in the film.  Andy seems like such a likeable guy.  There is also a nice cameo of David Letterman in the film, personally, I'm not a fan of Letterman's television show, but nonetheless he was actually pretty funny in his role/cameo.I would say that if you like Chris Elliott's comedy from Saturday Night Live, then you should go ahead an give this film a chance.  It's not the greatest film you'll ever see, but it's fun and entertaining.  Also, it's only 80 minutes of your life...I'm sure you can spare 80 minutes.

Lots of people would label this movie as one of the worst movies of all time, but it's consciously absurd (or wacky as Christ Elliot's character might say). Worst movies are ones that think they are legit, like The Order, or Batman and Robin. That being said, Cabin Boy is not the best comedy of all time. The crazy-funny parts are laugh out loud funny, but spread too far apart. I think this movie should have been wall-to-wall laughs.

Bill Cosby and Ray Romano are two examples of this -- Bill Murray one of the few exceptions.Chevy Chase has had some sporadic success, and even Martin Short -- one of the comedic geniuses of all-time -- has found his big-screen offerings sporadic.I think one of the reasons is that we are just too used to seeing them on the small screen, and/or in the characters/personas with which we have become accustomed. It also seems that their films often seem to be stories which would lend them to 10- or 12-minute skits, or the 22 minutes or so contained within a half hour program.Chris Elliott avoids this completely in this funny presentation. He succeeds in taking this character over-the-top, with the same quirky skill we've seen him employ on television so often. At 80 minutes, he also avoids making it overlong, and the supporting cast and Letterman's cameo are all well-presented, too.It's quirkiness is likely the reason this film didn't receive a higher overall rating in this site, and among professional reviewers.However, for me it's a thoroughly entertaining and engaging movie, and best of all, funny as hell.

Chris Elliot shines in the role of Nathaniel Mayweather, a wealthy young man fresh out of finishing school, forced into a life at sea on a fishing boat with men not of his stature. Fine performances abound in this grand seafaring epic, including Brian Doyle-Murray as Skunk, Andy Richter as Kenny, Melora Walters as Trina, the swimmer who catches Nathaniel's heart, and Ann Magnuson as Calli, who cleans his pipes. Best of all is Ricki Lake with an astoundingly nuanced performance as The Filthy Whore's head. With rich cinematography, amazing special effects, and masterful direction by Adam Resnick (who also co-wrote the suspenseful and heartwarming screenplay with Elliot), this is one movie that you shouldn't miss if you're a fan of great seagoing adventure stories like The Odyssey and Captain's Courageous. It's easily one of the greatest movies of this or any other generation; if I could rate higher than 10/10, I would do so with this one.

The movie is intentionally what it is, the acting, the jokes and the situations, the combination of which makes it artfully hilarious. This movie is in no way intended to be the best movie ever made and so those who have commented that it is the worst movie ever made have completely missed the point. The worst movies ever made are those which ascribe to and are promoted as being on  a level that they fall painfully short of, a recent example being God's and Generals.

Although it may, perhaps, be an overstatement to call Chris Elliot's script revolutionary, its message has a decidedly socialist bent.  In fact, I would venture to say that none of Elliot's other work, prior to OR since Cabin Boy has had a comparable impact on the way ship captains treat their crew - or for that matter, on the labor movement in general in this country.  It's safe to say that the success of Cabin Boy is a product not only of Elliot's vision, but also a fortunate case of being the right film at the right time, so to speak.Additionally, the cast must be credited.  Brian Doyle-Murray, Russ Tamblyn and many others give the performances of their careers.  The stand-out, of course, was Ritch Brinkley in a magnificent portrayal of Captain Greybar, captain of The Filthy Whore.   Far from the stereotypical old salt sea captain, Brinkley's Greybar is hard, harsh, irritable and irrascible, and yet even-handed and even sensitive, giving  a textured character which is so clearly missing from many other sea films.  Particularly touching is the scene when Elliot's character, Nathanial Mayweather, serves fish-stick kitties for the crew's lunch.  Words cannot describe the emotion that Brinkley's face conveys.  It's so touching because it's true!While Cabin Boy has its flaws, I have no doubt that it will be greatly appreciated by landlubbers and sea captains alike, particularly those who, like myself, started their careers as lowly cabin boys.

Along with Hot Shots, Hot Shots Part Deux, Loaded Weapon 1, Robin Hood Men In Tights, and The Naked Gun Trilogy. A stupid little spoof filled with cheap gags, and even cheaper laughs. I think Cabin Boy may not be on the level of the previously mentioned heavy hitters in spoofs, but it steps to the plate and delivers just the same.I viewed this movie again for the first time in about seven years, and now I see different qualities in it, as a mature adult, rather than waiting for the poo-poo jokes like I did as a kid. Not to say that I didn't laugh at cheap gags, being the mature adult I am...I just got a lot more bang for my dollar this time around. Chris Elliott may not be on target with that phony distinguished guise, but the supporting cast makes up for it ten fold. Andy Richter, on screen for all of twenty minutes is fabulous, making every second count. Why this man has not done more features is beyond me (Conan?). Also incredible is David Letter...uh...Earl Hofert as the old chap in the village. Witty banter (what makes Letterman, Letterman) with Elliott in classic Letterman style is just completely superb (all five minutes).In the end, all did a good job with what they had. It seemingly isn't the same Elliott that starred in the amazing Fox series Get A Life, but Cabin Boy turned out to be a bizarre little film that introduced me to tobacco spitting cupcakes and the saying Jesus Christ in a dump truck.

Have you seen Cabin Boy?, he asked. After I stated I hadn't even heard of it, he gasped and demanded, you make time for Cabin Boy. He would demand that of me for the rest of the year in nearly every film-conversation we had.This was four years ago, dear reader, and I'm ashamed to say I haven't made time for Cabin Boy until this past evening, to which my Television teacher would be appalled and disappointed, even more so when I say my reaction is one that isn't entirely positive. This is another one of those strange cult comedies that has mustered up a loyal, notable following after being a failure at the box office. Even after watching the film, I struggle to understand just why Buena Vista saw this idea reputable and reliable enough to funnel $10 million into the project, and likely another $5 million or so for marketing costs. Did they have faith in Chris Elliot and his commercially failing program Get a Life (this was before the cult-following for that film became largely known), or did they just want to broaden horizons? For whatever reason, it's pretty hilarious to think a solid amount of money was put behind a project I'm not even sure Elliot himself took seriously. The film is a cockamamie fantasy-comedy with Elliot portraying Nathaniel Mayweather, a snobby, self-centered manchild, who is invited by his father to sail to Hawaii aboard a large boat by the name of Queen Catherine. Nathaniel has just become a fancy lad at his prep school, the highest honor, and believes no change in his elitist attitude will grant him fine wishes in the real world. After being kicked out of his limousine for being rude to the driver, Nathaniel makes a wrong turn into a small village, where he climbs aboard a boat called The Filthy Whore instead of his father's Queen Catherine and learns the boat will not be docking for at least three months. Nathaniel is stuck aboard a ship filled with foul-mouthed, unkempt pirates, and has no way of contacting his father or getting to Hawaii whatsoever.Cabin Boy reminds me of a film, similar to Bio-Dome, in the regard that it plays like a film that would've been praised and hailed as a comedic masterwork if it were released in the early 1900's as a silent film. Being released in 1994, where expectations were far higher for film than they were in the 1900's, Cabin Boy found little appreciation initially. Speaking as someone who wants to try and give a fair and balanced review, I will say, the film clearly went through a director change, since it is noticeably scatterplotted and all over the place. According to reports, Tim Burton was originally supposed to assume the director's chair, but dropped down to producer, letting Adam Resnick take over, as he bought the idea for Ed Wood, which would later go on to be another cult success. Burton clearly could've related to the material much more than Resnick could've, making another film about a self-obsessed manchild in a surreal world with both Pee-Wee Herman films achieving great success. Even the backdrops of the film greatly resemble the artistic works of Burton himself, who would've also assure the film have some sort of commentary or overarching theme, small or large, rather than a cloying comedic emptiness to a film that would seemingly bear some internal meaning.Having said that, one cannot fault Elliot for being a commanding comedic force throughout not only this film but his career. Elliot has always put himself in strange situations, acting as the surrealistic version of slapstick comedian Tom Green, and in Cabin Boy, he achieves success in just being fun to watch. His character, quick to insult and demean while being entirely oblivious, achieves some strong laughs, and the film returns to the building blocks of comedy, which concern a character doing something he doesn't want to do or being stuck in a situation he doesn't want to be in. Elliot is a tireless comic presence and, if nothing else, Cabin Boy brilliantly showcases that. Even James Gammon and David Letterman in a rare starring-role at times collectively match Elliot and his goofy ways.The bottom line with the film is I didn't laugh as much as I marveled. The first thirty-five minutes proved funny, albeit a tad inconsistently, and the last forty or so proved for a nice surrealist adventure. However, the comedy of the film grows thin and inconsistent, the audience demographic for this picture is all over the place, occasionally treading on the randomness and innocence of a cartoon program to the more adult-oriented material that occurs when Melora Walters' busty character shows up on screen, and the entire event left me weary and somewhat mystified. Cabin Boy is a fine film for cult curiosity, but fails to muster anything but just that.Starring Chris Elliot, Andy Richter, Brion James, James Gammon, Melora Walters, David Letterman, and Alfred Molina.

This tale was trying to be Chris Elliot's Deuce Bigalow or Wayne's World, but Elliot never really had any great reoccurring characters in SNL.The tale is of Elliot's character, Nathanial Mayweather, who completes his education as a sass-mouthed, fancy boy only to find that he is stranded in the real world outside of the upper-class. He seeks a trip to Hawaii after getting kicked out of his ride home (for sass-mouthing the driver). The only transportation around in a fisherman's boar that has 4 drunken sailors onboard who try to treat him horribly so that they can fish in peace. Hijinx ensue, though, after he rescues a world record-hopeful swimmer who doesn't want to be saved, and a bunch of weird monsters on the Hawaii island. He learns that life with friends is better than someone-else's dreams for him, and returns to the crew of fishermen and the girl.So that's it...you now know what happens. No need to rent it. I got a little bored of the characters and their joking around. There were no real characters to get attached to...that was the main problem. There were occasionally funny lines in the movie (The pipes...are clean! and David Letterman's Do you wanna buy a monkey, little girl?) and, more importantly, the movie was co-produced by Tim Burton, who does amazing touches with animation and realism of outside characters (the siren on the front of the boat, the clouds in the storm, the quirky fish title sequence, the little characters mixed with the real-sized ones). That and the cameos by well-known talk show comedians David Letterman and Andy Richter have their own appeal to watch this film.Ultimately, I gave the movie a 5, though, because it wasn't an important film for comedy's sake, just different. Another story to throw along with the Austin Powers collection and Deuce Bigalows. Check it out to find your own funny stuff in the film, though. It has its moments.

Elliot is like Kaufman in alot of ways.  Some people never really understood Kaufman's peculiar brand of performance, and from the looks of the reviews below, there are plenty of people who don't get Elliot.  It was not always the *content* of Kaufman's performance that made you laugh, it was the fact that he was doing it in the first place.  For those that saw Man on the Moon, think about the Gatsby reading.  It wasn't funny for an audience member at that Kaufman appearance to hear all of Gatsby being read, even LONG after the joke of doing it wore out.  But paradoxically, if he hadn't done so it wouldn't have been as funny.  What's funny is that he had the gumption to go ahead and finish the entire work, regardless of what the effect on his audience was.Likewise, not everything that Elliot does is gut-busting hilarious.  For those of us who like his work, it's the absurdity of what he did that counts.  If you've seen Elliots short-lived TV series Get a Life, than the perversely surrealistic scenery of Cabin Boy makes more sense.  It's supposed to make the viewer feel like there is no normalcy to be found.  I'm not claiming this was some great artistic acheivement, it's simply a good way to facilitate Elliot's brand of comedy.  There was no comfortable, sane baseline in Get a Life to which characters could return, not even a basic continuity of plot between episodes (such as what characters are still alive.)  Likewise, Cabin Boy is simply a string of absurd situations that when taken separately are not really hilarious in that sense.  But taken as a totality, a fan of Elliot's humor appreciates the quirky nature of the film as a whole.I say this not to convince those who don't like Elliot, only to justify the opinions of those of us who do in the face of people who simply write this film off as horrible.  In terms of quality, the TV series was Elliot's best work, but this film definitely has some appeal to some people.

He was supposed to sail with the Queen something but instead ends up sailing with The Filthy Whore. The boat is filled with drunk, filthy, smelling fishermen of whom none are the least bit funny. They fishermen loose their cabin boy in a storm because Nathaniel convinces him in the middle of the night when the crew are drunk to change the destination and head for Hawaji. So basically after that they try to make a man out of Nathaniel a´la sailor way. No one naturally likes him because he's girly and they intend to leave him stranded on an island but he somehow survives the tests with a like little help form Chocki a Shark-Man(a half shark - half man) who also falls in love with our beloved new Cabin boy. Then Nathaniel suddenly finds a beautiful woman sleeping in the ocean. Her name is Trina and she is trying to swim around the world, go figure. The filthy whore is in quite bad condition after the storm so the men sail to the nearest island in order to repair their ship. After arriving on the island Nathaniel decides to become a man because he is frustrated over the fact that he is in love with Trina but she doesn't seem to care for him at all so the fishermen tell him about Calli, a woman-something with more arms then necessary who lives in a cave on the island. He seeks her up and finally loses his virginity i think. The experience naturally makes him Superman and next thing you know he and Trina get their very brief moment. The crew including Nathaniel and Trina have a battle with a giant named Mulligan after that. He naturally is p****ed off because Nathaniel had sex with his wife, that being Calli. Well finally shortly after that they arrive at Hawaji and the ending becomes a typical,sappy love-story ending where they live happily ever after, although apparently not on Hawaji.You see from the outcome of the film that the budget wasn't that high if there ever even was one.

First off I'd like to say I've seen a lot of crap in my life (I'm a Toronto Maple Leafs fan for goodness sake) but Cabin Boy is by far the worst movie ever made.  I rate it far worse then such forgettable stinkers as Godzilla, Johnny Mnemonic and all of the Kickboxer movies. It boggles the mind to think that somebody was actually willing to put up their own money to make this movie.  Please, Mr. Burton next time someone comes up to you with this great idea for a movie about an inept and fatuous Cabin boy and his cadre of retarded and mental defective buddies, get the hell outta there!What about the plot?  The plot is nothing but some non-coherent, inconsistent scenes grouped together for maximum frustrative effect.  (If a viewer finds himself wondering aloud What the hell's goin' on, relax it's natural) Even the cameo appearances by such pseudo-celebrities as David Letterman, Andy Richter and Ricki Lake can't save this slow moving train ride to oblivion from becoming a torturous visit to the dentist's chair. Cabin Boy is like witnessing the slow burn of the Hindenburg, only far less entertaining.The characters that inhabit this brain dead world range from flying/expectorating cupcakes, to multi-armed weirdoes, to Chocki the insipid shark-man.  I must add that none of these characters are even remotely funny in any of their appearances, actions or speech.Add to a movie with no-plot, no-point, no-character development some REALLY bad lighting effects and the whole thing gives you a headache.  The Ocean scenes are mostly shot in this trippy orange haze that causes the viewer to either go blind from squinting or develop some sort of permanent visual handicap.As for the dialogue, even a dyslexic, pig-Latin speaking monkey using only his tail could have come up with anything more engaging then the verbal diarrhoea smeared throughout this movie (if you think I'm joking look at the quotes section; and those are the best lines, all 6 of 'em).The excitement level of Cabin Boy ranges between boring and what is only comparable to having one's head slammed between a rusty fence.  The dialogue is so pointless and ridiculous that it makes Ace Ventura II seem a kin to Hamlet.While watching Cabin Boy I kept telling myself it has to get better, it can't possibly get any worse.  WARNING it can and it does.  Shoving peas up your nose is exactly as much fun as watching Cabin Boy.  Adam Resnick edited the movie down to 80 minutes and that's about 79 minutes and 59 seconds too long.  I never thought 80 mins was that long but if that is all the time you have left to live I recommend using it to watch Cabin Boy, it'll make an hour and twenty minutes seem like an eternity.

You know, one of those where some surreal character comes out and does some silly stuff for a minute or so and then goes away. Now imagine one of those skits without a host there to play straight man, no studio audience to draw energy from and it goes on for almost an hour and a half. Congratulations! You've now seen Cabin Boy.Nathanial Mayweather (Chris Elliott) is a prissy, fussy, arrogant, dimwitted son of a rich man. After graduating from finishing school is all his bewigged glory, Nathanial gets misdirected and instead of winding up on a luxury cruiser taking him home to Hawaii, he winds up a cabin boy on a fishing boat named The Filthy Whore. After a whole bunch of lame inanity with 4 grubby and overacting fishermen, Nathanial falls in love at first sight with a girl swimming around the world and must prove his manhood to her by having sex with the slutty 2nd cousin of the Hindu goddess Shiva. And that's not as funny as it may sound. After teaming up with a shark man to battle a giant appliance salesman (that's a giant salesman who sells appliances, not a regular size salesman who sells giant appliances), Nathanial realizes he no longer wants a life of aimless wealth and rides his new girlfriend out to sea. Again, not as funny as it may sound.This film is like a primer on why Letterman has gotten his ass kicked in the ratings by Jay Leno for years, why Conan bombed at The Tonight Show and hasn't set the world on fire at TBS and why there are so many comics beloved of other comics who never manage to achieve much mainstream success. There's a certain breed of comedian who are mainly focused on entertaining themselves. They're usually very bright and clever, oftentimes dark or subversive or edgy, but their humor is disconnected from or perpendicular to what other people find funny. They just make themselves laugh and if it amuses anyone else, that's a bonus. Such inwardly directed, almost defiant comedy can be hilarious to the general public in small bursts. It's essentially impossible to sustain it for a long period of time, something Cabin Boy makes agonizingly clear.I suppose disaffected, supercilious hipsters might find some laughs in this movie, or at least convince themselves to laugh at what they think only they are with it enough to appreciate. Normal folk will only stare at the screen in slackjawed amazement at how pitiful it all is. There's no narrative standard by which anything in this motion picture works. The attempts at humor are so fractured and esoteric that even stoned slackers would be hard pressed to summon up a giggle in response.Let me give you an example. Even back in 1994, goofy looking Chris Elliott was too balding and too bearded to play a kid fresh out of finishing school. We first see Nathanial when he's singing in a choir with his schoolmates. Now, a traditional attempt at comedy would fill the choir with fresh-faced teens and leave Elliott sticking out like a sore thumb. Cabin Boy fills the choir with guys who, just like Elliott, are far too old and too hirsute to pass for a student body. You see, you're supposed to anticipate the joke that would normally be told and instead appreciate them doing the complete opposite. This isn't smart humor. It's humor that wants to be applauded for being smart, which isn't the same at all.I quite enjoyed seeing Chris Elliott show up on the old Letterman show, not that I'm dating myself or anything. I didn't laugh or smile even once at this film. That pretty much says it all.

Also like Nathanial, the elder's talent casts an especially harsh light on the younger's near complete lack thereof. Chris takes us as Nathanial on a metaphorical journey starting from privileged upbringing complete with shots at televisions shows, both his own and David Letterman's, based on the respect others have for his father. And like Nathanial eventually that life of ease ebbs away as Chris/Nathanial have to make it on their own talents either making a comedy or surviving on a ship called The Filthy Whore. Neither fares well and Elliott deserves credit for taking an unflinching look at his situation and filming what he see even if only in metaphor. Like his career, little about the movie works. As a character, Nathanial grates and a lack of more attractive protagonists means little that happens provokes any empathy from the audience - The Filthy Whore could have pulled A Perfect Storm sinking about the 35 minute mark and no tears would have been shed. As a story, Nathanial's being thrown out of an anachronistically modern limousine only to mistake The Filthy Whore for his father's Queen Anne yacht works less well than your average Two Close for Comfort episode setup. As a comedy, even Letterman himself finds himself in a disjointed, seemingly improvised, unfunny exchange with his one-time television foil. In short, while a small, vociferous group of Elliott fans consider this a cult classic, it is only their hero-worship that makes it watchable.

Not only does it have Chris Elliot in it ... it's also got Andy Richter!  Andy Richter is Conarn O'Briern's sidekick from the hit U.S. television sitcom Small Wonder.  Chris Elliot is a comedic genius who ate dog food on David Lettermen's show Late Night With David Lettermen Show.  The movie is about a lovable yet stupid orphan, Dudley Tard (Chris Elliot) and his friend the Sea Captain (Andy Richter).  Dudley (Chris Elliot) finishes his last year of schooling at the orphanage, in England, and decides to sail to New York City to open his own chain of hotels (which we later find out is the famous Motel-6 chain).  Luckily, his friend the Sea Captain (Andy Richter) owns a yacht and knows how to sail it.  In the middle of the ocean, though, they are attacked by a gang of pirates who they later become friends with after they land on a mystical island inhabited by giants and by tiny people, where they have to work together to help the tiny people kill the evil giant. Then Dudley (Chris Elliot) becomes enthralled with a bathing beauty (some actress) who is trying to swim from England all the way around the world and back to England again.  They eventually get to New York City (though, to get there, for some reason they go through the Arctic Circle and have to fight a giant, evil cloud that blows cold wind and turns people into ice cubes) - this is the movie's only real plot flaw ... why on earth do they go to the north pole?  Or maybe I just missed something.  But, when he gets to New York and has to say good-bye to all his friends, Dudley (Chris Elliot) decides that he will still open his hotel chain but let his brother Felix (some actor) run it for him and he will go back out to see with his new friends the old pirates and his girlfriend too.  Unfortunately, the Sea Captain (Andy Richter) falls into the ocean five or six minutes into the movie and drowns - probably because he wasn't famous yet.  But he and Chris Elliot are very funny (particularly one scene where the two of them have an argument over where they should hide the pumpkin seeds).  Also making a cameo in this movie is David Lettermen as the Man who gives them False Directions (possibly this is why they went to the north pole???)  In any case, if you've never seen this movie, do yourself a favour and BUY IT. DO NOT RENT IT ... IT'S THIS GOOD!!!  FUNNIEST MOVIE EVER!!!!

Then, when he went on to do GET A LIFE, I watched every episode--even that later ones that weren't quite as funny. So, because of my appreciation of his work, I had very high hopes for this movie. Then, I saw that a little Chris Elliot goes a very long way. A movie starring him just isn't all that funny--particularly one with no real laughs--just him behaving like an idiot. For five minutes or even 30 minutes, this is fine--but for an entire movie? It's like the absolute worst and unfunniest thing Elliot's ever done--stretched into movie length. SLOW and OVERBEARING--not funny at all.

Basically a series of disgusting occurrences, the movie tries to merit laughs but only yields chuckles at best. The cupcake scene was particularly unnecessary. If the movie has any redeeming qualities, it's that David Letterman has a brief appearance. You may recall on the 67th Annual Academy Awards, he pointed that scene out and showed other people rehearsing for it.All in all, don't waste your time on this junk. Chris Elliott has done much better work than this (Groundhog Day, There's Something About Mary, Osmosis Jones).

This movie was designed for his audience, and yet there isn't a single good joke worthy of repeating even for ridicule's sake.As of 1999, this still ranks #1 on my list of the worst movies I have ever seen.

The last time I caught myself dozing I smacked myself in the head so's I could stay awake long enough for the scene with the Great Earl Hofert! er, David Letterman, that is.If I ever make it through the whole thing I'll come back and give this thing it's proper rating, which I'm betting will be a 4/10 "}{"Title":"Good Lord, please save people from watching this...","Date":"31 August 2004","Score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Romance","Review":"  I don't know. I can't even give a human explanation for this movie, if that is what it is  called. It is just unbelievable STUPID!!! Well, I doubt stupid even fits on it. As I said, there  is no way to explain it. I don't even know how this movie is on the video stores. This  thing is a crime!! The special effects are...... wait a second, THEY SHOULDN'T EVEN BE  CALLED SPECIAL EFFECTS!!!! Well, anyway, those things, whatever you want to call them,  are no better than effects I can do on the back of my closet. They are faker than  anything else you have ever seen. It is horrible. The whole movie is horrible. The only  thing I'm glad of is that I didn't have to pay for it. I checked it out from a Library so I  didn't have to pay at all. And I'm glad of this because if I would've rent it, I will be feeling  robbed right now. DON'T WATCH THIS!!!!!

The sad thing is, I generally like Chris Elliot and Andy Richter, but someone should have saved them from themselves on this one. The sissy pirate script is horrible - the script The Producers should have picked for a guaranteed bomb. The Producers' fault was in picking a serious script that was so bad it was funny -- here the script is a funny script that is so bad it is just sad. And it is only made worse by terrible overacting and poor direction. The movie makes Freddie Got Fingered look like a masterpiece.  "}]
