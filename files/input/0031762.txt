It is a first-hand lesson in what the Hawks universe was all about, and it is unsurpassed entertainment from the word go. Two hours of undiminished tension, action-wise, sexually, whatnot.New York showgirl Bonnie (Jean Arthur) is on a stop-over in small-town Barrance somewhere in South America. Here she meets Geoff (Cary Grant), the leader of a small band of mail pilots having to cross a perilous mountain pass on a daily basis, and casualties are to be expected. Within little more than ten minutes of screen-time the young man, who had asked Bonnie out to dinner, is dead in a spectacular crash scene, and from there on the plot and the action pick up space. Bonnie is dismayed by the way the dead pilot's colleagues seem not to care about his death, they just go about their business and pretend he was never there in the first place, so as not to be reminded of their own mortality. Joe died flying, says Geoff. That was his job. He just wasn't good enough. That's why he got it. Dismayed as she may be, though, Bonnie cannot leave, since she is falling in love with Geoff but fast.In this confined space, made even more confined by the dense fog and pouring rain that characterize the local climate, the scene is set for one of Hawks' perceptive gatherings of a group of people to have us observe the dynamics of people interacting, different ethos at work in a seemingly laconic male environment, the love, the rivalry, the camaraderie. The fear. Further upsetting the close-knit community is the arrival of a new fryer (Richard Barthelmess in the best performance of his mature years) who has to prove himself doubly because once in his life he turned yellow. With him he has Rita Hayworth, Geoff's old girl-friend ...This is quintessential Hawks, just in the way that Barthelmess' character has to strive to earn any ounce of respect from his peers. But in every frame it is a deserved classic, and great performances abound.8/10 "},{"Title":"A Notch Above The Rest In Its Era","Date":"17 March 2006","Score":"36 out of 40 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Romance","Review":" To quote to the movie clich√© on the back of the VHS cover, this is old-time adventure, the kind they don't make anymore.Well, they've always made good adventure stories through the years but you get the message it's simply a good, solid story done well on film .What puts this a notch above other adventure tales of its day are 1 - excellent cinematography; 2 - interesting aerial scenes with neat-looking planes flying in the fog and around and above the treacherous Andes Mountains; 3 - a top- notch cast featuring Cary Grant, Jean Arthur, Rita Hayworth, Richard Barthelmess, Thomas Mitchell, Allyn Joslyn, Sig Ruman, John Carroll and Noah Beery Jr., and 4 - a story that is generally interesting.I say generally because there are a few dry spots, mainly Arthur's continued pining over Grant, but most of it fun to watch and it gets you involved in the story.

It's really a thoughtful film with substance under the guise of Hollywood famous stars and lively screenplay banters. Subject touches on death just 20 minutes into the film. Certainly no dull pacing. It has golden segments, like the exchanges between Grant and Barthelmess, Grant and Mitchell, Mitchell and Arthur, Arthur and Grant, and 10 minutes later, we see people gathered round by the piano singing songs and cajoling - not without sorrow beneath. Be not fooled, sentiments are there for friends passed away. It's not, but it is, a way of handling grief.It's life, matter of fact and not hung up or lingering, simply moving on, devil may care, with boldness, dare, and risk-woe-begotten (or forgotten, for that matter). Men - one track-minded, to fly to deliver no-matter-what. Women - worry, or why worry. To love the man, much of letting go and let him be comes with the territory, even if it's Jean Arthur or Rita Hayworth. The story revolves around not just Cary Grant's Geoff leading the pack in the Andes, but also Thomas Mitchell's brother gone, Richard Barthelmess' past recur, Rita Hayworth's nostalgic fear, and the spunky, sentimental Jean Arthur's Bonnie wraps it all up. The supporting cast aptly contributes from the restaurant-hotel-mailing service owner, the lively South American accents and melody, to the pilots who are green and know not what peril is, and the lone fog-watcher and his donkey. Secrets revealed, conflicts challenged, and there's a growing promotion of trust through it all. Between business partners, colleagues, friendship or marriage - that unquestionable trust, without asking out loud but understood within - is what life and dare all about.This film grew on me. I first saw it on cable TCM the latter half and couldn't wait to catch it again for the full story. Screenplay by Jules Furthman, music score by Dimitri Tiomkin, directed and produced by Howard Hawks, Only Angels Have Wings 1939 (available on DVD) is full of life, humor, drama, adventurous spirits, and non-stop exchange of word deliveries - entertaining, enjoyable, and heart-warming.

I believe it was Leonard Maltin who stated that Hawks is the best director you've never heard of. Meaning that Hawks is commonly not mentioned with the likes of Ford, Hitchcock and Welles. This is probably because Hawks usually made popular films that focused on dialogue, character development, and speed (whether action or comedy) to set himself apart. Hawks had complete confidence that the audience liked what he liked.....and most of the time he was right! Beginning in 1939 Hawks began a streak of hits that would continue into the early 50's. After making Bringing Up Baby (something of a flop...now a classic) Hawks departed RKO after being replaced as director of Gunga Din (whose story he had a big hand in developing) and made this film at Columbia. Hawks intention was to make a film about the daredevil attitudes and experiences of pilots flying the mail in South America. The safety conditions for these pilots are non-existent and as a result they live each day as though it was their last.More than most movies this film is often pointed to as a summation of the Hawksian style. A group of men working closely to accomplish a common goal who are united by the dangers involved. These men are not family men or people with long term aspirations. They live in the moment and find their meaning through their comraderie and understated support of each other. As with most Hawksian dialogue (Jules Furthman would become a regular Hawksian writer after this one) it is understated and never overly emotional. The fun begins in Hawks films when a woman arrives who is often more than a match for the man she's in love with! (this pattern prevailed in the comedies as well). In this film Cary Grant, who is one of the greatest Hawksian actors, plays Geoff the head of the air mail airline who has sworn off women because they just don't seem to deal with his dangerous lifestyle. Therefore Geoff deals with women in a very cavalier way. Jean Arthur is American woman who arrives and turns his world upside down. But this film is not just a romance. There are multiple relationships between the characters that keep the viewer engrossed. Thomas Mitchell is most intriguing as the buddy who has been with Geoff for a long time and is quite subtle in his dedication toward his friend. Richard Barthlemess is outstanding in a late career role as the pilot with a checkered past who has to win over the trust of the other flyer's. (he's already won over the trust of Rita Hayworth, which is nothing to sneeze at!)Only Angels Have Wings is one of Hawks best, and perhaps most personal stories. Hawks claimed that it was one of his most true films in that he had been a flyer in World War I and was very interested in the dynamics between the early daredevils of aviation. The film moves along at a crisp pace and contains many tense, gripping scenes that keep the viewer entertained despite the Hawksian emphasis of character/dialogue over plot. Angels was a huge hit for Hawks and was the beginning of his most successful decade in Hollywood. In terms of influence Hawks would give ANY golden age director a run for his money. Directors such as Quentin Tarantino, John Carpenter, and Martin Scorcese would agree! Hawks films are worth studying and Only Angels have Wings is a textbook sample. I highly recommend it! 10 Stars!!!!!!!!

The former was adapted from the stage play by Spig Wead and for whatever reason Warner Brothers did not put in the kind of production values the A list cast from that film should have warranted. In my review for IMDb I said it was a photographed stage play.Hawks seems to have made the corrections for the deficiencies of Ceiling Zero in this film. First of all he wrote the story for Only Angels Have Wings and made sure to put in enough action and he took the action away from the control room of that small airline in an unnamed South American country. He also cast the leads against type, Cary Grant as a cynical, existential Bogart like hero and Jean Arthur as the wise cracking show girl stranded in the tropics. A part that Rita Hayworth would play to perfection later on.Rita's in this one as well, in the first substantial part in an A picture. She plays the wife of disgraced flier Richard Barthelmess and one of Cary Grant's old flames. According to a recent biography of Jean Arthur, she and Rita did not get along so well. Both of them are retiring types and each thought the other was being snooty to her. Arthur found that out later on and was far more cordial as was Rita. Arthur was also upset that the future glamor queen of America would get all the notice. Rita sure got enough of it.But there were plaudits all around. Howard Hawks got great performances out of Grant and Arthur, expanding the range of both these talented people. Only Angels Have Wings is both a good character study and has a lot of drama as well.And Cary Grant was far more successful at a Bogart type role than Bogey was in doing Sabrina.

It functions brilliantly within the Hawksian system where male bonding is key, and where Woman is an outsider. Where romance is a minor part of life and where love is expressed through symbols and not through language. The group of professionals and their easy, jocular interaction is the beating heart of this film and all the group scenes are brilliantly directed. I also like the element of screwball comedy (a genre in which Hawks is one of the few masters) which presents itself in Grant and Arthur's coffee scene. It shows how much Hawks trusts his actors and his material in that he knows that such changes of tone can strengthen, rather than weaken, the key drama. I love this film even though its presentation of the world is not the one I'm the most sympathetic to. The film is not incredibly strong in psychological nuances - not when compared to directors like Sirk, Fuller, Welles, N. Ray, etc...and the basic tone is that of a stoicism which occasionally cracks (slightly) under pressure, but which almost immediately reestablishes itself. It's an attractive world view, but not one I'm incredibly comfortable with. There is no place here for ambiguity - not on any deep, non - localized level. I've been reading some Hawks interviews, and I now understand why Hawks was uncomfortable with being labeled an artist. His attitude towards films and film-making is clearly the same as the attitude of the men in this film towards their work and their lives (and deaths). It's simple you're either good enough or you're not, and you're only as good as your last flight. This identification between the man (Hawks) and his production (Only Angels Have Wings) helps to illuminate the greatness of the film, but it also explains its emotional and aesthetic limitations.

By  1939, with another war looming, audiences were long since sick of such tales,  but by resetting the tale at a South American airport (where Cary Grant runs a  mail service which is in danger of losing its contract), it was just barely possible  to come up with a credible situation where Grant could again order his flyers to  their deaths, and where death would be greeted with the callousness thatcomes from knowing you're probably next and your best friend will eat yoursteak for you.  The reviewers who say Grant doesn't play it serious enough here  are exactly missing the point-- his seemingly breezy, actually brittle facade IS  the Lost Generation attitude, straight out of The Sun Also Rises.This is one of the great tough romances, whose real romance is with death itself,  which needless to say makes it several steps darker than Hawks' superficially  similar To Have and Have Not, let alone Rio Bravo (which reproduces its maincharacters almost exactly-- Grant as John Wayne, Arthur/Angie Dickinson as the  woman trying to get into the boy's club, Barthelmess/Dean Martin as the guywith a guilty past of failure, and Mitchell as the guy who age is catching up with/ Walter Brennan, old age fully caught up).  In gleaming black and white on the  DVD, the foggy, fake studio set and the silver skies might be the dreams of a  pilot in the instant before his crash.  Too grim a bite of caviar for the general,  perhaps, but a testament for a generation that saw more than it could put on film,  and one of the greatest works of art to sneak out of the studio system underdisguise of glamorous entertainment.

You will also see a youthful Noah Berry, Jr., as well as Allyn Joslyn, Victor Kilian, and Sig Ruman.Only Angels Have Wings is the story of mail carriers who fly often in bad conditions through a perilous mountain pass. They thrive on the excitement and danger. Their boss is Geoff Carter (Cary Grant). Jean Arthur is Bonnie Lee, a chorus girl passing through who decides she can't leave - like a lot of women in the past, she's falling for Carter. One woman who fell for him turns up as the wife (Hayworth) of a new pilot (Barthelmess) who once parachuted out of a plane and left Kid Dabb's (Thomas Mitchell) brother to die. With fliers out of commission or dead, Carter has to use him, but warns him he's only getting the most dangerous missions.This is a testosterone-heavy movie, very much the kind of thing John Wayne would do. The romantic part of the story, between Carter and Bonnie Lee is lethargic, with fine actress Jean Arthur left standing around worrying. Hayworth, with a decidedly different hairline, has a small but showy role. The meaty roles belong to the men. Grant is terrific as a devil-may-care boss who hides his emotions, and Barthelmess, who would retire after World War II and end his long career, is very good as the disgraced pilot in a role that suited him perfectly. Underplayed, one sees the pain of his past decision on his face. Thomas Mitchell played so many great roles - this time, he's a pilot who has to face his anger as well as a physical problem. Very poignant.Though a little disjointed and a little too long, Only Angels Have Wings has great atmosphere and some spectacular flying sequences and effects. Released in that golden year of 1939, it's another example of Hollywood at its apex.

Supposedly it's very dangerous to fly mail back and forth from this particular frontier town, and the life expectancy of a flier isn't long. Therefore, when sexy Jean Arthur shows up on a stop-over and gets a hankering for boss Cary Grant, the sexual tension rests in whether or not Grant will be alive long enough to make forming a romantic attachment worthwhile.With a second world war looming on the horizon, one can see how this story was both relevant and irrelevant at the same time relevant as a parallel for the many American men who would soon be in the position of not knowing whether or not they would be alive from day to day; but sort of irrelvant too, since we're talking about delivering mail here, not going to war!! I can't imagine a movie made today about the dangers of being a FedEx delivery man (unless you count Cast Away).Anyway, Cary Grant is horribly miscast as the crusty man in charge, who puts up a callous front and tries to convince everyone that he doesn't care when one of his men dies. I can only take Grant seriously when he's in a tuxedo and being dapper; here they outfit him in ridiculous parachute pants pulled up to his nipples---I kept expecting him to drop to the floor and start break dancing.As for the female lead, Jean Arthur could do no wrong, as far as I'm concerned. Rita Hayworth shows up in an early role as another love interest for Grant, and one-time silent film star Richard Barthelmess struts in playing Grant's mail carrier arch rival (!), looking for all the world like he's still acting in silent films.Director Howard Hawks creates an authentically foggy and sweaty South American atmosphere, and for all the surface silliness of the plot, he fashions a pretty compelling movie about the instinct to challenge death that dominates these characters' lives. I don't hear this movie mentioned along with the other classics released in the golden year of 1939, but it more than holds its own against the more popular films of that year.Grade A- "},{"Title":"A glorious drama, underrated by the general audience","Date":"20 April 2006","Score":"16 out of 28 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Romance","Review":" Howard Hawks' surprisingly dark film about mail pilots in the Banana Republic and their often dangerous lives is one of the great lost classics of Hollywood's golden era. Although the film was financially successful and well received by critics and audiences when originally released, it has since become a distant memory to many of even the most avid classic film fans. This is unfortunate, for the film is a flawless combination of thrilling drama, light comedy, and special effects that are still very effective today. The film is uncommonly unsentimental and realistic when compared to other films from the same era, and is all the better for it.Cary Grant and Jean Arthur, both of whom are cast somewhat against type and in complex roles, deliver sensational performances that should have won them both Academy Awards (the fact that neither actor was even nominated is inexplicable). The rest of the cast is also terrific, with each and every actor in the impressive ensemble providing strong and believable characterizations. This is particular true of Rita Hayworth, who became an overnight superstar after her appearance in this film was met with a tremendous response from both audiences and critics. An absolute masterpiece, ONLY ANGELS HAVE WINGS deserves to be as highly regarded as GONE WITH THE WIND, THE WIZARD OF OZ, and any of the other classics from the golden year of 1939.

I don't say this is a bad film, but to me it's a little illogical...although perhaps that's a different time perspective of the 1930s compared to today. The crux of the film is quite simple -- repeatedly, fliers are crashing and dying flying the mail up over a particular foggy mountain pass in South America. In fact, later in the film, you get to see the mountains, and you KNOW they wouldn't fly into them in the fog...well, actually they would fly into them -- literally -- in the fog. But, the mail must go through!!!!! Why not delay until the fog lifts? But of course, at least often when they crash, the mail is destroyed. So let's see -- the way they're operating, much of the mail never goes through, rather than sometimes just being delayed. Hmmmmmmmmmm. And they are destroying expensive planes in the process. Hmmmmmmmmm. Is this anyway to run an airline??? And of course, Cary Grant and others are very stoic about the repeated deaths, while only Jean Arthur has a lick of sense and sees the tragedy for those who die. Nevertheless, Jean Arthur begins falling in love with Cary Grant, who runs the flying operation...despite the fact that he repeatedly insults her.Many see this as one of Howard Hawks' best directorial efforts, and perhaps it is, once you accept the rather boneheaded premise. Cary Grant's role here is not one you're likely to like him in, and I'm not so sure he even performs it well. There were times I felt he was over-acting (and just for the record, Grant is my favorite actor). Jean Arthur, whom we usually savor in comedies, shows her diversity here in a straight dramatic role. In terms of supporting actor Richard Barthelmess, I can only assume he did his best work in silent films...he certainly wasn't very interesting here. This was one of Rita Hayworth's first important screen roles, and she's quite good here, although the best role in the film may very well belong to Thomas Mitchell. This is one of his better roles, though he had many.There are some things wrong with this film. Some of the scenes of airplanes landing and taking off are so primitive in terms of fake set that it's almost childish. And let's see -- there's all that fog in the jungle, but just a few minutes flying time away it's virtual desert. Hmmmmmmmm. But worst of all is when Jean Arthur doesn't want Cary Grant to fly because he might be killed...so she shoots him. Oh brother! There are more Cary Grant films in my DVD collection than of any other actor. And there are some I've watched a dozen times. This was a struggle to wade through the second time around...in fact, it took me 3 days to finish watching it. Considering the positive reviews others give it, there must be something I'm missing.

The cast is fine.  Jean Arthur was always a kind of goofy and appealing actress, along the lines of, say, Jill Clayburgh or Glenne Headly or Blythe Danner.  She's the one who works herself into the group.  Cary Grant is simply Cary Grant.  He doesn't adopt a character the way he did in Hawks' earlier Bringing Up Baby or his later Monkey Business.  He has no outstanding moments either, although he does cry at one point -- unconvincingly.  His wardrobe throughout is a riot.  He wears the sort of wide-brimmed panama hat that Desi Arnaz used to wear in his nightclub act.  The waist of his pants are pulled up around his floating ribs and the pleated trousers seem to balloon outward.  Rita Hayworth is the girl who is married to a newly arrived pilot.  She's a loser because she's very emotional, carries a torch, gets unruly when drunk, and is altogether too feminine.  Her husband's career is tainted with cowardice, although she doesn't know about it.  She is less glamorous here than she would be in subsequent pictures because her widow's peak is not yet electrolocyzed or electrolyiticized or depilitated or decapitated or whatever they do to your hair.  As her husband, Richard Barthelmess is receding and somewhat goggle eyed, but he eventually wins his spurs.  The other pilots are suitably terse and masculine.  I found myself wondering about the lone radio operator in his shack on a snowy mountain top, whose sole job is to report on the weather in the pass.  What did he take up there with him to read between weather reports?  My guess two or three Russian novels.  That should be enough to last him for a year.  His nickname is Tex, the same as the radio operator in Hawks' The Thing From Another World.  The film is a bit weak in the usual Hawksian kind of funny wordplay.

He's a cold hard man and then his ex Judy MacPherson (Rita Hayworth) shows up with her husband Bat (Richard Barthelmess) who has a checkered past as a pilot.There is no doubt that these are great stars. Director Howard Hawks brings a bit of humor but this suffers from the rambling romance. Jean Arthur starts as a funny bombshell and she's completely overshadowed as soon as Rita Hayworth walks in. All of a sudden, Jean is the frumpy second thought. It breaks up a nice rom-com and the movie struggles to recover the story. It also has too many things going on. There's an action thriller. There's a backstory of conflicts with the second in command. There is just too much going on.

Into this Men-Only world come two quite different women, both of whom either fall or have in the past fallen for Grant's brand of tough love, wandering spirit Jean Arthur and a young old flame, Rita Hayworth, who are required to adopt the same masculine, devil-may-care approach to life as the men or get cast aside. Perhaps this survival of the fittest ideology is overplayed, particularly when a young pilot, full of life and personality, gets killed and promptly forgotten about within fifteen minutes by his erstwhile chums and colleagues - I felt the scene where Arthur, swallowing her outraged indignation at the callousness of the other fliers, ends up pounding out Peanuts on the piano to all and sundry, just too outrageous and unbelievable.The narrative is episodic taking in the various dangerous scrapes and emotional crises of pretty much all of the main characters, taking us under their skin in a winning examination of this hardy bunch of outsiders with their own moral code. Themes of comradeship, bravery, loyalty and moral redemption are played out in full, interspersed by exciting missions involving hair-raising aerial stunts and effective use, for the time, of special effects.As indicated Grant leads his crew superbly, heartless and caring, pragmatic and generous by turns. You sense that he's really being stretched as an actor here by such a demanding part both physically and emotionally and he comes up with possibly his best ever performance. All the support players make distinctive contributions so that you end up rooting for pretty much all of them by the end. Perhaps Arthur and Hayworth's women don't really belong in the film at all in fact, a point emphasised when the former, very prominent in the first half-hour, disappears from sight for the next half-hour as Hawks focuses on the manpower at work and you hardly even notice, never mind miss her.In truth though, there's very little to carp at - this is a major film in a major year, 1939 (considered by many to be Hollywood's best ever) and never drags along its lengthy, for the times, two hour duration. Highly recommended.

They're led by the crafty Geoff Carter (Cary Grant), who's attracted the attention of a wandering American woman, Bonnie Lee (Jean Arthur). When Geoff's best friend (Thomas Mitchell) is grounded due to poor eyesight, he's compelled to take on a flier with a checkered past (Richard Barthelmess). The flier, Mac Pherson, brought along a wife (Rita Hayworth) who knows very little about the event, which involved the death of Mitchell's brother.In various interviews, Hawks said that Jean Arthur was practically the only actress who he couldn't help. And indeed, she seems to be plowing through the material, not really bringing the role the kind of sultry appeal that Hawks seemed to want. She seems just like a schoolteacher stuck in the movie for whatever reason, and her motives never seem to match her style or her presence. Other than Arthur's performance though I thought the film was pretty good. The scenes with Mitchell and Grant have some good drama. The atmosphere of constant danger and tension makes for a good setting, and there is a good scene with Grant and Hayworth where he douses her with cold water. One wishes that Hayworth had been granted the lead in the picture and that Arthur had played the wife. It seems like the style of the actresses would match the characters better that way around.

The basic premise of the movie is that of a female musician Bonnie Lee (Jean Arthur) who arrives in a South American port and ends up meeting a bunch of pilots headed up by the head of the airline Geoff Carter (Cary Grant) and gets involved with them as they fly their missions through a life threatening mountain pass. Whilst the attitudes to work and relationships have clearly dated badly with time it is still a fine film with both the leads giving good performances and some solid direction too. The inevitable romantic liaisons between the lead characters plays well as does the supporting story of a pilot who has previously shown cowardice finding redemption from his fellow pilots. A good if not great movie that is well worth giving a chance. I would watch it again though I am not sure how many times.

However, Hawks more successfully captured that spirit of passion and outlandish adventure in 'Only Angels Have Wings (1939),' a romantic, screwball comedy-style love story born amid a tense, exciting and epic aviation adventure. Hawks was evidently fond of story lines centred around aviation, considering he had already produced 'The Dawn Patrol (1930)' and 'Ceiling Zero (1936),' and the film's screenplay by Jules Furthman was expanded from Hawks' own 1938 short story, Plane Four from Barranca. The film explores themes of male camaraderie, professionalism, and bravery, and the amusing consequences that arise when an independent woman arrives to disrupt this closely-knit community of men. The drama unfolds in the small port at Barranca, Ecuador, a village bordered by the might and majesty of the Andes Mountains, and where tropical storms are a regular but treacherous occurrence.'Only Angels Have Wings' was filmed in Los Angeles, and does an excellent job of evoking the exotic tropical environment of South America. The characters always appear beleaguered by the overwhelming heat and humidity of the Ecuadorian jungle, and the frequent storms bombard the landscape with stifling fog and rain. The scenes of aviation, largely produced using elaborate model-work, remain mostly convincing, and those few shots that aren't have a likable charm about them. Roy Davidson (photographic) and Edwin C. Hahn (sound) received an Academy Award nomination for their special effects work, the first time that an Oscar had been offered in that category. One particular aviation shot, apparently involving no effects of any kind, follows Richard Barthelmess' mail-plane as he attempts an extremely risky landing on a perilous plateau. Filmed from adjacent aircraft, the long shot follows the plane as its swoops around the makeshift runway and comes in for the landing, coming to a stop just metres from the edge of the cliff. It's an elaborate and meticulously-staged moment that really makes you appreciate what cinema is all about.The story involves Geoff Carter (Cary Grant), who manages a air-mail business from the small port-town at Barranca. Though he has been romantically-involved with many women, Geoff has basically given away all chances of happiness, being unwilling to place any woman through the stress and fear that besieges any wife whose husband has such a dangerous occupation. Spirited and intelligent Bonnie Lee (Jean Arthur) arrives at the town, and, despite her initial aversion towards Geoff, slowly finds herself caring about him. Geoff's repeated attempts to rebuff Bonnie's advances ultimately prove futile, and he discovers that the woman who truly loves him will never allow herself to be affected by his rejections, however selfless and noble his intentions. Forming the film's dramatic heart is the character of Bat Kilgallen (Richard Barthelmess), a disgraced pilot who finds himself aggressively slighted by his comrades for ejecting from his aircraft and leaving his navigator, the brother of Kid Dabb (Thomas Mitchell), to die. Even when offered only the most dangerous missions, Kilgallen's unwavering desire for redemption earns him the respect of those who had formerly denounced him as a coward.

In a short three year period from 1938 to 1941 he directed the screwball romantic comedy Bringing Up Baby, followed by this adventure film Only Angels Have Wings, followed by the zany comedy mystery movie His Girl Friday, and ending with the war drama Sergeant York. Few of his contemporaries &#x96;Ford, Capra, Hitchcock, DeMille&#x97; could handle each and every one of these genres with such great invention and high style.Only Angels Have Wings combines elements of all these and more. Cary Grant is often said to be miscast, but isn't the combination of his great good-looks and charm tempered by a genuine amusement at and indifference to the wiles of the female the very quality that gives his portrayal of Geoff Carter its special Hemingwayesque character? A man's man, Hawks was never misogynistic. Quite the opposite is true; his best films are full of beautiful vital women and comic/romantic encounters. But in this film as in almost all of Hawks' studio films, women, attractive as they might be, are always secondary. What really counts is the story of a band of brothers ---the rules and values of a macho world.Lovers of big studio cinematography will delight in the atmospheric lighting of the master Joe Walker, Capra's cameraman and one of the very best that ever was. The great character actor Sig Rumann is given more to do than his usual comic German roles.

If I had a criticism though, the film could've done with more of a South American feel. That said, the performances are splendid, Cary Grant is a macho and hard-bitten sort of person here, and Jean Arthur is suitably sympathetic and chirpy.

He put his outlook into so many of his films that otherwise would've, or could've, been standard dramas or comedies or westerns. But if one had to make an educated guess, Rio Bravo and Only Angels Have Wings would be good contenders as the quintessential Hawks films that are *not* flat-out comedies (even as one can see amusing elements throughout). In the case of this film, Hawks crafted an entertaining aviation picture that actually spoke loud and clear to the stubbornness and courage- sometimes both at the same time- in men in peril. It features a top-shelf cast of stars and character actors, has some surprisingly well constructed special effects and flying sequences, and the action and drama and romance fit altogether with barely a hitch.If there's maybe one minor criticism, and it's so minor I feel nitpicky mentioning it, the real 'adventure' plot is a little more engrossing than the romance, with Cary Grant's chief flier Carter leading the missions for this group of pilots on missions delivering mail through dangerous terrain, and having to deal with a bitterness at hand with the pilots as an old wound is opened with the re-emergence of Killian aka Mac Pherson (well cast in underplayed Richard Barthelmess performance) and his new wife played by Rita Hayworth. This goes without saying I don't see why Hawks and Arthur had a problem working together, as she seemed to be cast spot-on as a strong-but-tender female presence in the midst of all these men (and, you know, Rita Hayworth who needs no explanation), who is the only one aside from Kid to get emotionally close to Carter. While Grant and Arthur's scenes are good, even very good at their best (loved the transition from tenseness with the coffee and then to the admission of love), they're nearly overshadowed by the power and effectiveness of those surrounding the missions and the pilots.And those scenes involve the kind of male camaraderie that Hawks is known and admired and even loved for, in expressing the story so well that these characters and personalities come through clean and clear. We've got Kid, played by Thomas Mitchell, who's a wonderful old lug who can't give in about losing his sight as a pilot; we've got Kilgallen as the conflicted but dedicated pilot, who did something terrible once and is seen with a scornful eye by all except, oddly enough, for Carter who sees him for what he can provide for the job. And then all the other minor pilot characters, even those who don't stay on screen too long (one of which, sadly, dies in the first fifteen minutes), who all make up this tense but tight-knit group. And somehow it all works on film; if it were real life, I could see some things being stretched for credulity. But with Cary Grant, Jean Arthur, Rita Hayworth, and this cast and rousing story, it's believable and excellent work. If only for the ending, where one sees moments that are so true to the characters, and how the actors play them in the situation, that it's just about a perfect classic Hollywood moment.

Jules Furthman, the greatest dialog writer in Hollywood history, outdoes himself here with laconic exchanges where what's said is only the tip of the iceberg. A world of meaning and emotion churn BETWEEN the lines.One example How many viewers even notice that Rita Hayworth, when she's first alone with Grant, produces a match to light his cigarette without him asking? In the context of the story, this tiny detail is a key to their relationship, past and present. The whole film is like this, stuffed with small details that illuminate the backstories, thoughts, and feelings of the characters.ONLY ANGELS is a high watermark of intelligent, grown-up writing for the screen. It's a smart film written for a smart, observant audience.Cary Grant should have won an Oscar for his intense, deeply-felt performance -- this from a star we usually associate with comedy. Many in Hollywood were jealous of Grant, of his good looks, skill, talent, versatility, and success. So they wouldn't give him awards.The film is perfectly cast, written, directed -- even photographed. The opening scenes of the exotic port dazzle in a rich B&W chiaroscuro worthy of Von Sternberg. Above all, this film -- if you open yourself to it -- delivers a hell of an emotional punch. The flying scenes are as exciting as the personal scenes are sensitive and affecting. The nail-biting drama and suspense are leavened with just the right amount of comedy.Here you see Rita Hayworth's star quality emerging for the first time, while D.W. Griffith's early-silent film leading man Richard Barthelmess underacts brilliantly as a man haunted by a guilty secret.The first time I saw OAHW, I remember thinking the scene with the condor was far-fetched, but after the bird-caused plane crash in the Hudson River recently, I realize I was just ignorant about aviation. Hawks, a pilot and friend of pilots all his life, knew exactly what he was doing.Movies do not get better, or richer, than ONLY ANGELS HAVE WINGS. It's one of my top-five favorite films of all time.

He did it with screwball comedy with Bringing Up Baby, with Westerns in successive decades via Red River and Rio Bravo, thrillers with The Big Sleep and here, literally at the tail-end of both a decade (30s) and the genre that helped define the decade he does it with the 'flying' picture. No less than eleven leading players and supporting and/or 'character' actors keep the pot boiling in a multi-faceted storyline that embodies Hawks respect for the 'professional' summed up succinctly in Grant's terse advice to Arthur when she asks/offers to play the piano 'You better be good'. In Hawk's world you're either a pro i.e. good at what you do or you're a waste of space a la Noah Beery Jnr' Joe Souther, who crashes fatally in the first ten minutes because, as Grant says 'he wasn't good enough'. For the record this is one - if not THE - movie where Grant says 'Judy' several times throughout but never more than once on each occasion when he addresses the gal who done him wrong Judy McPherson (Rita Hayworth) now married to another flier, Bat Kilgallan (McPherson), Richard Barthelmess, who changed his name in an attempt to avoid the stigma of baling out of a plane and leaving his navigator to die in it. For trivia buffs it's possible to see a connection between the short sequence where Barthelmess - who gets all the lousy jobs because of his reputation - flies a cargo of nitro glycerin through a pass in rough weather as the genesis for George H Clouzot's The Wages Of Fear in which four men drive a similar cargo in two trucks over bumpy terrain in the same part of the world, South America, but for everyone it's first rate entertainment from a vintage era and if I mention ALL the players by name - Allyn Joslyn, Victor Kilian, Sig Ruman, John Carroll, Thomas Mitchell, Don 'Red' Barry, Noah Beery Jnr - and throw in the leads - Cary Grant, Jean Arthur, Rita Hayworth, Richard Barthelmess - it's because they ARE that good, pros to a man.

It starts out like a romantic comedy. An attractive female entertainer named Bonnie Lee arrives in the port town of Barranca where the airline is based and two young pilots compete to take her out to dinner. It quickly, however, takes a darker turn and we realise that this is going to be a serious drama. The job is a dangerous one, as the airline's main function is carrying mail from Barranca to the interior of the country through a high pass in the surrounding mountains. Soon after Bonnie's arrival one of the two young men who greeted her is killed while attempting a difficult landing in fog. The main story revolves around the interrelationship of four characters. Bonnie falls in love with Geoff Carter, the manager of the airline, but the situation is complicated by the arrival of a new pilot, Bat MacPherson, and his wife Judy, an old flame of Carter who is still in love with him as her marriage is an unhappy one. It turns out that MacPherson is using a false name and is recognised as Bat Kilgallen, a pilot loathed by other fliers because he was once responsible for the death of his mechanic in a crash. To make matters worse the dead man's brother, Kid Dabb, is working for the airline. (Kid's nickname is presumably an ironic one as he not a young man- indeed, he is older than most of his colleagues). The film was written and directed by Howard Hawks, who had earlier made The Dawn Patrol, a film about flying aces in World War One. (Richard Barthelmess, who plays MacPherson here, had also starred in the earlier film). It was released in 1939, only a few months before the outbreak of World War Two. (Although it is ostensibly about pilots in peacetime, it seems to look forward to the coming conflict. The fatalistic attitude of the pilots recalls that of wartime fliers; they accept the risk of death as an occupational hazard, and consider it bad form to mention the name of a dead colleague and rank bad form to express any grief at his passing. If one takes the film's peacetime setting literally, this fatalism seems suspect. In war, when servicemen are duty-bound to risk their lives fighting the enemy, a fatalistic acceptance of death can seem like admirable stoicism. In peace it merely seems like a reprehensible way of avoiding thinking about how their job might be made safer. (What wrecked Carter's relationship with Judy, and threatens to wreck his relationship with Bonnie, is that both women worry far more about his safety than he is prepared to worry himself). It seems to me, however, that Hawks was using flying as a metaphor for war, realising that before long Americans would find themselves at war again and hoping to prepare them for the necessary sacrifice. The character of MacPherson is that classic figure from war films, the one-time coward who tries to redeem himself by actively seeking danger and volunteering for the most dangerous missions.The love-triangle (or quadrangle) is not the most interesting aspect of the film; we always know that Geoff will end up with Bonnie, if only because of the unwritten rule that the bigger-name star always gets her man. Bonnie was played by Jean Arthur, an established star, and Judy by a then little-known young actress called Rita Hayworth. (I wonder what happened to her!) Although Rita's part here is not a very large one, this proved to be her big breakthrough and paved the way for her successful career. Bonnie is an example of what was to become known as the Hawksian woman, the strong, determined female character who is a feature of so many of Hawks's films. (Other examples include Lauren Bacall in To Have and Have Not, Rosalind Russell in His Girl Friday and Joan Collins in Land of the Pharaohs).There are some good acting performances but no particularly outstanding ones. What makes the film stand out is the realism of the flying sequences (excellent for the 1930s) and the dramatic tension which Hawks is able to evoke. The pilots in Only Angels Have Wings may be fighting for nothing more elevated than a lucrative mail contract, yet we experience as much concern on their behalf as if they were fighting for their country. 8/10 "},{"Title":"Things happen awful fast around here.","Date":"26 April 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Romance","Review":" One thing right out of the gate - you can't convince me that after being spurned by Cary Grant, someone like Rita Hayworth would hook up with a guy that looked like Richard Barthelmess.

I guess that's because he played it the way the story called for, as sort of an egocentric banana cowboy who believed women got in the way of things. Like making a living. You know with these stories, by the time it's over some girl will break down the hero's defenses to change his mind, but at least old Geoff stayed in character as much as he could.

One of the aspects of this mythic movie that I saw in my adolescence, which means exactly one generation after its making, it was the act that most of the scenes were by night and much more rarely by day light, what to me has conditioned my youngest impression for the whole of the story, where two girls and a guy are there, in a foreigner ambiance, near the mountains and big birds, for the life or death of the characters like facing continually monsters till its destruction, as though from the period before historic times at the top of the snowed mountains, like if all this it was situated on a given and concealed tableland at the end of the lost world. The noise in the improvised airport without practically lights by night, when a plane lands or take-off risking continually its crash against any slope frighten me at the time. Hawks here was the master in his own career as pilot, before perhaps making it the most important movie of his lifetime, with that analogy for the condors in 1939... In South America by night the planes were obliged from the strict timetable landing and take-off, but with the probable shock with or from the condors, risking so frequently the crash and the death of the pilot or sometimes his own assistant as occurred here. What means that, in the context of the time - and much more than the idea of a group linked by professionalism, as it is said for the main characteristic of the artistic mind concerning this movie - and its glamor quite savage, coming from isolated human beings from the industrialized world ? Hawks is at his best surely with this epic of mailing aviation, scaling Barranca in Peru, a small community. My favorite scene concerns one inside an airplane, when carrying out the mail the pilot had lack of oxygen and condors attacking it. Is it the correct way, by such a dramatic nightmare, to bring the mailing post over the mountains and risking his life for nothing more than only winning for civilization the experiments of first communications, along a continent so exploited in its resources by the sellers of technological inventions, situated as owners for the most in the North of this same world of adventurers and happy few ?Hawks in this movie put the symbolically wings in such an imaginative flux of talking from this guy as pilot of high experiments, risking the good name of this company of aviation - as matches over the soil like lamps illuminating the night - competing with such a terrible birds of high mountains. By this way, also as though eluding the terrestrial side of every human being under such a warm desire, playing with women as if it was from somebody with such an instinct for synchronizing with fluctuation on the atmosphere nearby this tableland in South America with a little machine linking pleasure for life, simultaneous escaping from death on the valley. Underlining adventure above dramatic tension, as in increasing suddenly his own coldness over the stress, for accomplishing by intimacy with such a kind of nature, without breathing almost anymore than collapsing imminently, so a given track of honor and quite fear as cure paying existence.

Rita Hayworth and Cary Grant don't always hit their dramatic marks, the special effects may seem dated to today's audience, and there are some contrived plot twists. But there is so much heart and emotion, such great cinematography, quotable lines and swift direction by Hawks that makes this film worth watching. If Scorsese had made 'The Aviator' in 1939, this might be what it would look like.Bonnie Lee (the always wonderful Jean Arthur) is a piano-playing showgirl on her way back to New York, stopping between boats in Barranca. She quickly falls in with a band of tough-shelled pilots who fly mail over the dangerous mountains, rain or shine. The leader of this bunch is Geoff Carter (Cary Grant, in his first dramatic performance), with the toughest chip on his shoulder. Within the first 20 minutes we see, mostly through the eyes of Bonnie, the death of a pilot in a fascinating flight sequence. But the most important part is how everyone reacts after the death of a friend. While Bonnie is grief-ridden, she is more shocked at the lack of sympathy and refusal to acknowledge the death. She quickly learns that this is the only way for them to deal--if someone dies, they shrug it off, as if to say he wasn't good enough, so he died. I'm better than him, so I live. After a few tears she becomes, like all great Hawksian women, just one of the guys, joining them in a spirited rendition of The Peanut Vendor, in one of the many memorable bonding scenes. Beneath the stoicism, there lies a web of friendship and heart that makes this film work.Bonnie then decides to stay for a few more days, hoping to get to know Geoff. And in those few days, another surprise visitor appears Bat Kilgallen/MacPherson, a pilot shunned for jumping out of a crashing plane, leaving his fellow engineer to die. The engineer just happened to be the brother of Kid Dabb (Thomas Mitchell), Geoff's best friend. Also along for the ride is Judy MacPherson (Rita Hayworth), Geoff's ex-love. Stress and sexual tension soon arise, and complications get even more complicated, from Bonnie falling for Geoff to Kidd dealing with his hatred for Bat as well as his physical problem that could compromise his career, and Judy's confusion as to why everybody hates her husband. Finally everything comes to a climax in a stunning flight scene.As usual, Hawks assembled a great cast, even despite the problems. Jean Arthur makes a great Hawksian woman by giving her role the empathy that would otherwise be lacking. Thomas Mitchell, widely known for his work in supporting roles including GONE WITH THE WIND, gives a quiet and sorrowful performance as someone whose whole life is flying and isn't ready to give it up. It's very refreshing to see Cary Grant in something other than a screwball comedy. Geoff Carter is the kind of role that would be perfect for John Wayne (who later frequently collaborated with Hawks), but Grant gives the role a sensitivity that would've been lacking in Wayne's super stoic persona. Grant has a scene at the end that requires tears and emotion, the first we see from such a hard man, and he doesn't quite get there. But from other scenes, he is so commanding you can't help but surrender to him, just as Bonnie does. Their scenes are magical together. The same goes for Rita Hayworth; she was still early in her career, and her inexperience shows (not that the flat character does anything to help). However, Hawks hired her because she had a face the camera liked; her presence and radiant glow is so alive you almost forget her shortcomings. Almost.With today's CGI-ridden special effects, the ones here may dull in comparison. But the cinematography, especially of the planes flying over the beautiful Andes, are stunning, and done without the help of a green screen. That's what I love about these old movies you can always tell that the directors spent more time talking with the actors and writers than worrying about the special effects, which is what make the special effects truly special.Many note that this was Howard Hawks' most personal film of his career--he frequently associated with pilots, and he knew the characters inside and out. This is what gives the film the heart that it needed. His trademark dialogue and speed becomes a necessity to not become too melodramatic and maudlin, with both wisecracking and wise results. Hawks was the Spielberg of his day. Like Spielberg, there is such an air of professionalism even during the outlandish situations and circumstances, a heart and a brain and courage to each shot. Under his wings, even the flawed WINGS soars.

It's clearly a 'formula' creation - but it's a perfect formula, perfectly executed, with perfect stars and the perfect director. In a way, it's the epitome of the old-school Hollywood studio flick. But it's also much, much more.As a drama, the film is near perfect. The weird triangle of Grant-Arthur-Hayworth is fascinating, yet supported by sub-plots that are all strong enough to be good movies in themselves. We have Mitchell's 'The Kid' fighting to keep his status as a pilot. Barthelmess fighting to return from disgrace. Grant struggling to keep his fledgling airline going. It's all epic stuff, as good as anything the studios produced.But there's also a mythic quality - the 'angels' reference. These are men who are striving to be more than just the sum of their earthly struggles. This is mankind trying to hoist itself up by its bootstraps. To build a wonderful future in one of the most backwards places on the planet.The mystique of aviation is central to that mythology, and perfectly captured by Hawks. As a sometime flier myself, I've been present when aviators have been killed, and seen a similar reaction to what's shown in this film. The risks are accepted up-front, so when something does go wrong there's no pause in the conversation. Everything continues, almost as if nothing had happened. The one actual flying sequence in the film, where Barthelmess lands and takes off on a tiny mesa, is not only spectacular in itself (as executed by the great Paul Mantz), it's absolutely true to the kind of flying that bush pilots continue to engage in, even today. Hawks clearly knew his stuff.Then there are the film's cinematic merits. Largely filmed on sets, it has an oddly claustrophobic feel. These characters live in a hell-world of jungle heat and stark black shadows, waiting desperately to soar into the sunlight. The musical interludes are haunting, on a par with the 'Play It Again' sequence in Casablanca. And the performances are gigantic. Grant, in particular, was never better, perfectly evoking flippant humor as a mask over deep sadness.This is a 'romantic' film in the grandest sense. It's one of my favorite films of all time, and certainly one of the best Hollywood films of all time. It may seem a bit dated, or melodramatic to modern audiences, but to me that sense of distance only adds to its charm. This is a film that's mellowed with age, gained depth and complexity. It deserves to be more widely appreciated.

There are five other performers who really shine; Thomas Mitchell, Richard Barthelmess, Noah Berry, Rita Hayworth and Jean Arthur. They each manage to impress with their ten to twenty minutes of screen time.Some people, including director Howard Hawks, criticize Jean Arthur for not playing it sexy, but I think her choice was right. She comes across more as a gal-pal, but with a lot of sensitivity. It was the right way to catch the Cary Grant macho character, who knew he could have any pretty woman he wanted. Besides, she probably realized that she couldn't compete with Rita Hayworth in the sexy department, so she relied more on her acting to create a more complex and sympathetic character. I only knew her from her role as Clamity Jane in the Plainsman and the classics, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and Shane. I'll have to look for more of her stuff.The aerial photography and sequences are well done and provide most of the action-excitement in the film. The script has enough twists and fresh devices that it still holds our attention.My one quibble is that we really do not get anything of a South American atmosphere. Except for one police officer, it seems that everybody speaks English in the South American place they were in.

Lots of them have grown into becoming classics but of course in a way they are also all sort of the same. Only Angels Have Wings is one of the more original ones though, due to its original settings and main concept.The movie can be called an aeroplane drama, with plenty of adventurous and comedy elements involved. The entire movie is set at a small airport, with dozens of pilots, who do errants by plane for costumers and numerous other reasons. It's an unique original world that isn't handled too often in movies but it's quite intriguing really. It concept and settings provide the movie with plenty of great moments.It's also a movie that is being made great by its characters and the actors which portray them. Great thing is that this movie has more than just a handful of great characters and big name actors portraying them. With Cary Grant it has a great leading man and with Jean Arthur and Rita Hayworth the movie also has two more than great female actresses. Richard Barthelmess was also really great in this, in one of his talking roles. He is still best known for the work he made during the silent-era, especially the classics movies he did with director D.W. Griffith.The movie also has a good story, that looks pretty formulaic on the surface but still works out better than usual because it knows how to blend several themes and also genres. The movie is not purely just a drama and not just purely an adventure movie or romantic one. It's a rather pleasant mix of it all that works out on basically all levels. The movie is also more pleasant and perhaps also easier to watch for today's modern audience than most of its other fellow genre movies.The movie has some great sequences with its planes in it. Especially for its time it must have really been something to watch. The movie has some good stunt flying in it and also at times uses some pretty good looking early special effects. It also received an Oscar nomination for this, as well as for its black & white cinematography by multiple Oscar nominee Joseph Walker.It's a movie that perhaps is not as well known as Howard Hawks's most other work but it's just as great and well worth watching.

Now this isn't to say that it is perfect or the finest film of the age--in fact, since it came out in 1939 (probably the greatest year for American films), it was doubtless overshadowed by a host of other films. Sure it couldn't keep up with GONE WITH THE WIND, MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, GOODBYE MR. CHIPS and a whole host of other huge films that year, but in no way does this mean it wasn't a very good film. In fact, I really can't think of anything bad about the film, though I did find it a bit odd seeing Cary Grant play a role that seemed more designed around an actor like Clark Gable or perhaps Gary Cooper. In other words, seeing the sophisticated gent that was Cary Grant in the South American jungle just didn't seem real. It wasn't really a problem with Grant's performance but more my expectations based on the types of roles he generally played.The story is about a small struggling airline in the Andes and the group of outcasts who often give up their lives trying to make the dream work. Cary is the boss and the entire organization is thrown into some disarray when Jean Arthur enters this all-male enclave. A bit later, when Richard Barthelmess and Rita Hayworth come along, the chaos seems to intensify. Instead of discussing exactly why all this comes to a boil, it's probably best you just see the film for yourself. The acting and direction, as I stated above, are excellent--plus the writing and action are very good as well. A very good film--particularly for airplane and old movie buffs like myself.

Cary Grant stars as a misogynist pilot running a mail service in Latin America. The film begins as Jean Arthur arrives to stir romance and trouble. Early in the film, when one of Grant's pilots crash, he blames her for the accident, because he wanted to have a steak dinner with her.  He later apologizes, but the theme of the film-that nobody can take responsibility or make promises for another-is established.  Men cannot have love for one another, only respect or hatred.  The job is all there is, and women are not even worth speaking about.  It is an adult film, with open sexual references and plenty of drinking and smoking.  In spite of all its serious themes and numerous injuries and deaths, the film has a real rip-roaring pace to it, at least some of the time.  People will mourn for a minute, then sing and dance, and then get back up in the air.  The film does establish a wonderful sense of uncertainty.  Life can fall apart at any moment and we should be ready.  Sadly, it doesn't realize that preparation involves growing closer to others rather than pushing them away.  Still, it is unique in its time and setting as well as its characterizations of lost Americans late in the depression.  It has a certain kinship with the Wages of Fear.  The highlights are the beautiful aerial photography, which at times even follow a plane as it races along a canyon.  Hawkes was one of America's great directors of intelligent, adult films, but the misogyny and general antipathy of this film leave it a notch below his strongest work.

Not all are successful. The starlet who falls for the tough boss in town. The tough boss who is trying to keep the business together for one of his buddies.  The return of an old flame.  There are several other plots that take place, and perhaps that is the problem, too many tangents and storylines that are difficult to resolve and the resolution of them is forced and not very believable.         It does not help Cary Grant is miscast as the tough but lovable boss.  I can see Clark Gable, but Grant is not right here. He has very little chemistry with Jean Arthur and his relationship with a very young Rita Hayworth is not genuine.  Richard Barthelmess is very good in a role that makes no great demands on him and Thomas Mitchell and Sig Ruman offer excellent supporting work.         I think, for 1939, the flying sequences in the air are quite good.  I was particularly impressed with the camera work done in the scene where Richard Barthelmess's character goes through a mountain range (presumably the Andes), and does a quick landing. Nice camera work.         Overall, Only Angels Have Wings is not a success, but should be seen as an example that even very talented people can go very wrong.6 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Angels Need Better Casting","Date":"6 May 2009","Score":"3 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Romance","Review":" This creaking classic is not a bad movie, but it is one that suffers from some serious miscasting. Cary Grant does what he can with the role of Geoff Carter, honcho of a rag-tag South American airline. The part, which is clearly made for a John Wayne, does not fit Grant, despite his efforts. The usually watchable Jean Arthur suffers through her role as a displaced American entertainer, now in love with Grant. Yet there is very little chemistry between the two leads. For much of the movie, Arthur is reduced to hand-wringing and self-doubt.I don't know how it was received at the time (1939), but Grant's wardrobe is perhaps the most humorous thing in the movie.Thomas Mitchell is clearly too old to play 'Kid' Dabb, Grants buddy. Mitchell, who perhaps never played a young man, looks more like Grant's father than his contemporary. Rita Hayworth is Grants old flame, now married to a disgraced pilot. Hayworth does not here look old enough to be anyone's old flame. Richard Bartholmess does a bit better, but still looks more like a George Raft-like gangster than a bush pilot.Capable character actors flesh out the numerous remaining roles.There are too many sub-plots and tangents in the script to really make for a good flowing story. Many scenes play out like Robert Altman pics, in which many things are happening at once. Many flying (actually landing and takeoff) scenes are done with unconvincing models.Despite all the above drawbacks, the picture is not a turkey. It can be enjoyed, if only as a good effort.

This was a time when no one in Hollywood seemed to have enough going for them to pick up a candle-stick phone and call the shipping industry and ask Is this a boat or a ship, where they would have discovered that only the small vessels such as the lifeboats carried on the ship's decks and submarines are properly called boats.Even after having appeared in some 40 studio films in only seven years Cary Grant was, at 36 still a chubby-cheeked tyro and not yet fully formed into the super matin√©e idol of the 1950s and the forever interesting raspy-voiced Jean Arthur was at 39 mostly wasted here after her triumphant Frank Capra films of the early 1930s and at this time on her downhill slide with only 14 years of work to go before her final feature appearance in Shane (1953); a grand stage left exit with what has turned out to be generally conceded as the best Western ever made.On the minus side of this production with its curious title that needs a chrome steel shoe horn to fit in with the predictable story is its staginess, the awful comic book breaks in continuity and the technical impoverishment. On the plus side is a wonderful ensemble of 1930s character actors leaving the Golden Age of Hollywood, the interestingly created ambiance of a tropical airport lost somewhere on the borderlines of Latin American civilization and enhanced by the beguiling guitarist-singer Manuel √Ålvarez Maciste.This low budget schedule film really did not have much of a chance to compete with the enormous high-end output of 1939 Hollywood that many scholars call the greatest year of the Golden Age but it tries and is worth watching with a large bowl of popcorn at hand.

DeMille's 'The Plainsman' with Gary Cooper as Calamity Jane, Jean Arthur went on to play alongside Cary Grant in 'Only Angels Have Wings'. Grant attempts to play an unconvincingly tough pilot in this film, but relies on a favourable script rather than character to get him out of situations. He does, however, get the opportunity to play alongside Rita Hayworth, and feel that at this stage in his life, he is just a popular superstar rather than a grass roots actor. "},{"Title":"Unconvincing, dated drama with weak performance from Grant...","Date":"8 March 2002","Score":"6 out of 21 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Sorry to have to disagree with most of the favorable comments on this one, but I finally saw the film on TCM the other night and was very disappointed. Only Jean Arthur and, in a very brief role, Rita Hayworth, displayed any genuine emotion. And Thomas Mitchell does his usual sturdy characterization of a man with 22 years of flying behind him who is ready for the last doomed flight in this tale of the mail must go through.Cary Grant is unable to get into his tough guy persona and in a scene requiring some tenderness and tears, he is unable to be at all convincing. He plays the entire role with the same casual air he uses in comedy and gives no dimension to the character. Most natural performance among the males in the supporting cast comes from John Carroll, a breezy, natural actor who never received enough recognition in later films of the '40s.Jean Arthur fans will like her in this one--she uses all her standard mannerisms to great effect but without too much help from the lumbering script. Only the airborne scenes have the stamp of authenticity that Hawks was able to provide--but all of the interior scenes have a murky, stagebound look to them despite the atmospheric weather effects. And the storyline is never able to rise above the overall depression that story elements keep bringing to the surface. This was Richard Barthelmess' last performance in a film and you can see how sadly he has aged and how listlessly he portrays a man with a past who has to prove himself worthy of respect. Evidently, Howard Hawks was unable to get a strong performance out of him in a pivotal role.The plot is too trite, the action and the storyline is all too dated and only the presence of Jean Arthur and Rita Hayworth make it worth taking a peek. It seems longer than its two-hour length due to the slow pacing, particularly at the start.Ironically, Jean Arthur has her best scenes opposite Thomas Mitchell rather than Cary Grant.

Creaky, dated, only worth watching for Jean Arthur and Thomas Mitchell. Its tough to make a very good adventure film shot entirely on the Columbia set, with bad art directors and Ed Wood props. Balsa planes that go boom boom in the night are more ludicrous than exciting. How this movie ever got considered as good early Hawks must have been shown at the Braille institute. And one viewer suggested Gable instead of Grant. That would have only made Clark look bad. Howard, you probably laughed all the way to your safety deposit box on this one.One note the music by Dimitri Tiompkin is also unrecognizable. Usually you can hear his fingerprints on a score a mile away, but even he was wasted in this one.

Cary Grant is so ridiculous that I normally can't take him seriously.  The plots around him have to be good enough and this movie does not have one of those plots.  There is a scene where Cary Grant gets burned by a hot coffee kettle, and then bets burned by it again when he tries to pick it up 10 seconds later.  No human being, nor even monkeys for that matter, is that stupid.  That pretty much sums up the directing for this movie.  Don't get me wrong, I thought Hawks did an alright job with Bringing Up Baby, but certainly not this one.  Some highlights of the movie are its poor editing, the scene where what looks like a chicken goes through the windshield, and the ridiculous ending. "}]
