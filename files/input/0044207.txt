Nope, today it's Special effects, stars, then story.... in fact, even the stories aren't original!!!This sums up why I like this movie so much and many like it from the same era.  They're exciting, fun, and captivating.  The kind of movie that leaves you thinking, dreaming, having nightmares, all in the name of fun.  You're left dreaming of what it would be like,  how you'd react, what you'd do. You'd sit and ponder about a new life on a new planet.  And not once would the level of special effects tarnish your view of this gem.When was the last time you felt that way coming out of a modern movie?  My guess is a lonnnnnng time.  There are very few exceptions today.  The special effects in movies like Worlds was icing on the cake... BUT IT WAS THE CAKE THAT MATTERED!  Today,  it's all icing and the cake can't support it (crappy icing, in fact!!)Eat your cake and have it too!  Watch When Worlds Collide!

And with that very important fact established for those in the audience that might actually believe otherwise, we're off and running. Some movies are so loopy they're just plain fun to watch no matter how absurd they are. And with an opening like the one described you know this George Pal gem is going to be a hoot. When Worlds Collide was Pal's follow-up to his successful Destination Moon which along with Rocketship-XM launched the Golden Age of fifties sci-fi. It was a simpler time, an era in science-fiction films when all that was required for space travel was to Strap yourselves in! and contract your muscles! When astronauts wore leather flight jackets instead of space suits, and were always on the make for a beautiful pair of gams, (i.e. women) when all scientists smoked pipes and wore goatees, (that's how you knew they were intelligent) and were completely absorbed in their ivory tower research, oblivious to everything including at times the safety of the world. Worse whenever some dangerous creature was running amok their response to stopping it was invariably, It shouldn't be destroyed, it should be studied! or It's so much wiser than us, we can learn so much! It was an era when a woman wasn't considered complete without a man in her life, and even if she was a brilliant astrophysicist, all she really needed to know (as every man knew) was how to make a decent pot of coffee, when radiation was the answer to any problem, as in Beast from 20,000 Fathoms or was the reason for every problem like the giant ants in Them! Well, with the exception of extraterrestrials, radiation and giant insects, When Worlds Collide has all this and more!This film is so ripe some enterprising filmmaker could do a parody of it, except it's hard to imagine how it could be done better. Eminent astronomer, Dr. Emery Bronson, (pipe smoking and goateed) has made a terrible discovery from his remote ivory tower observatory in South Africa. Two heavenly bodies are on a collision course with Earth. One, called Zyra will pass close enough to wreak havoc on land and sea, while the other, called Bellus will actually strike the planet and destroy it days later. Money doesn't mean anything now. Time is all that matters! So the pertinent, secret data must be taken at once to Professor Hendron in New York for corroboration on the Differential Analyzer, a fifties version of the computer. Enter Dave Randall, a leather flight jacket wearing pilot-soon-to-be-astronaut. Dave is always on the make for a beautiful pair of gams sort of guy, and blissfully unaware of the bad news he is carrying. At the airport Professor Hendron's daughter Joyce, played with wonderful vapidity by Barbara Rush awaits him. A newspaperman has offered Randall $5,000.00 for the secret of the little black box handcuffed to him. But Dave takes one look at Joyce and like a starving man eyeing a sirloin steak tells the reporter, No thanks, I'm working on a better offer! With the clock ticking on humanity they decide to take a taxi through the New York traffic to the breathlessly waiting professor. Along the way Randall manages to coax out of the trusting Joyce, who evidently never heard the expression, loose lips sink ships that the end of the world is upon them. Rush exclaims, I'm frightened! And then in one of the film's choice bits, slowly faces the camera and exclaims deadpan, You see, I haven't the courage to face the end of the world! The music swells, Randall squirms as if he just sat in something smelly left behind by a pet, slow fade out.Most of the film deals with the construction of the rocket-ship, a latter day Noah's Ark, which will carry 44 individuals picked by lottery to make a new home on Zyra. It's their hope to build a bright shining new white world-literally for there is nary a single member of a minority group to be found among them. But money is needed for the project and since the Federal Government can't be bothered with saving humanity, wealthy industrialist Sidney Stanton, supplies that-provided he has a seat reserved aboard. I think you're all crackpots! he hisses. Build it! John Hoyt, deliciously nasty as the wheelchair bound Stanton steals the film. The cheesy but fun special effects kick into high gear with the approach of Zyra. Tidal waves strike New York, earthquakes rock the planet, and volcanoes erupt while the celestial choir swells yet again as a solemn voice-over intones, Never has humanity felt so close to God! Hendron reproaches Stanton with, Not your sort of hypocritical prayer but the kind that come from deep inside a man! after the latter has gunned down his wormy manservant Ferris who made the mistake of telling his employer he was an Easy man to hate! Things go from bad to worse when those who lost the lottery decide to riot. The good news is that Joyce realizes she loves Dave, and best of all he gets to go along and fly the craft to Zyra. Alone with Joyce days before take off and the end of the world, he remarks with all the gravity and emotion of a man suffering from acute gastric discomfort, The last sunrise! Joyce tries to get him to look on the bright side, The same sun will rise again on the new world! she says, not the least bit distressed that several billion people are about to have their lives snuffed out in a cataclysm of cosmic proportions. Oh well, guess she'll make a pot of coffee.Everything turns out alright in the end-all things considered. Cue celestial choir, fade out. When Worlds Collide is a fun, goofy, glorious science-fiction postcard from the early fifties.

Time is needed to do the unthinkable create a rocket ship that will fly 40 or so people to one of the planets passing by to keep the legacy of mankind alive. This is an innovative, thought-provoking science fiction film. Little action is in the movie. It could have focused on the despair and panic people would have endured with such news, but instead the film, deftly directed by Rudolph Mate, focuses on the group of scientists and people involved trying desperately to fight against their greatest enemy - time. Calendars have pages ripped off showing the urgency. Sure, the science and logic in some of the physics of the ship are a bit ludicrous, but everything is presented in a very believable manner. Acting leads Richard Derr and Barbara Rush do workmanlike jobs while supporting players Larry Keating, Hayden Rourke, John Hoyt and Frank Cady(Sam Drucker from Green Acres) really give the film some life. Most importantly the film has you thinking about its premise well after having seen it. What would our world do with such news? How would we determine who would go? What would they find once they got there? Many scenes in the film stand out the flooded vision of New York City with skyscraper tips jutting out of the water and the last scene of a group of space pilgrims landing on a new home for humankind surveying their new world with wide-eyed optimism, hope, and fascination. This is a sci-fi gem; one not to be missed.

Except for the ending scene, the special-effects were passable, the acting was good and the dialog pretty realistic. The story plausible? Of course not, but what they did know of space travel in 1951? Hell, we didn't send a man on the moon until almost 20 years after this movie. No, this is not one of those popcorn flicks that is so bad, it's good or just plaint stink.

It had a solid reverence for God and to science at the same time, a realistic portrayal of people under stress and how they would react knowing their world was coming to end.

That having been said, however, let me hasten to add that When Worlds Collide is an enjoyable movie.  The special effects of a half-century ago are still impressive, and the film's commentary on human nature is rather incisive.  On the science and technology side of the ledger, however, the movie is seriously lacking, and the book does a much better job of discussing the technical difficulties involved in any kind of evacuation from Earth and the reseeding of the human race on another planet.  Also, the collision between Earth and the star Bellus is a complete disappointment.John Hoyt's performance as self-seeking and cynical billionaire Sidney Stanton is the best in the movie.  He doesn't overplay the part, but mixes the right proportion of facial gestures and acidic voice inflection to give his wheelchair-bound character a completely believable profile.  He is the real star of the movie.  The other performances are adequate, but lack the depth of Hoyt's.  The movie could have used another thirty minutes to fully develop both the storyline and the other characters because a theme like this needs two hours or so to fulfill itself.Many have criticized the Disney-like final scene as the survivors of Earth's end walk onto the soil of the new world Zyra.  To be fair to Pal, the production was rushed at the end to meet budget costs and what was put forward was the best that could be done in a limited time.  Pal also intended to film a sequel After Worlds Collide, in line with what the book had, to continue the story.  Unfortunately, Paramount Pictures scotched that, and no sequel was ever made.  Pal carried that disappointment to his grave.I'd like to see When Worlds Collide made into a movie again.  Despite Deep Impact and other movies like it, When Worlds Collide stands as the ultimate disaster movie, and with today's technology, a much better version than George Pal's could be made.  A sequel should also be done as was the case with the original book to bring the story to a logical conclusion.  For now, however, all we have is the 1951 film, and it still holds up well and will reward viewers who appreciate thrilling adventure.

Despite this, it is still one of the best ones of its era. The basic story is good, but not great. What sets it apart are the characters within it and the insight into human nature it gives you. This makes the film very allegorical and makes you think. Many of the characters, such as the leads, rise to the occasion and only think of saving others when it appears most life on Earth will be destroyed. Then, there are the jerks who also show their true colors--such as the crowd who try to storm the space ship bound for a safe new world, and especially the evil old financier who who wants to save his own skin and could care less about others. John Hoyt plays this role beautifully and it is very, very much like the character C. Montgomery Burns from the Simpsons!Oh, and lest I forget, for 1951, the special effects are absolutely amazing. Aside from a pretty flat-looking matte painting used at the end, the space ship effects and flood effects were just terrific and earned this movie a well-deserved Oscar. This is a great sci-fi film that all fans of the genre need to see.

I feel compelled to defend it against the comments of walcaraz from San Diego, who posted in April 2003.  Here are my commentsMINOR SPOILERS AHEAD!1.) The science is wholly convincing for 1951; it even takes into account such things as accumulated velocity and gravitational pull.  Is it totally accurate?  Certainly not; this is, after all, science fiction.2.) It is made clear multiple times in the film that the US is not working on the project at all.  It is a wholly private endeavor.  Note the last of the newspaper headlines when we scroll down on the newsrack - Laughed Out of United Nations.  No government believes the scientists, so they must team up with industrialists and do everything on their own.3.) Cultural diversity in 1951?  I'm afraid the idea did not yet exist.  It seems bizarre to fault any movie of this era for not being perfectly race-coordinated according to current fashions.4.) It is true that it would be more efficient to have fewer men and more women, but the movie makes clear that the passengers are to be chosen by lot in as fair a way as possible.  A moral point is being made here, not a scientific one.  Regarding the genetics, let's not forget that DNA was not discovered until the 1950s, after this movie had already been produced.  Eugenics had been around since the 1920s, but if anything it is a strength of this movie for resisting that kind of race-purity thinking (as walcaraz allows).5.) These final images do stand out as different from the rest, which are more realistic.  But remember, we are talking about a new world here, a magical and poetic (and dare I say spiritual) beginning of mankind, after the flight of a modern Noah's Ark.  Why not add a touch of idealism here at the end?  Let's not let jaded modern-day cynicism ruin this earnest and touching moment.To me, if there is anything about When Worlds Collide that will mar it for contemporary viewers, it is the film's myriad Bible references.  Scarcely 10 minutes will pass without a reference of this type.  But I think that such gravity only adds to this film's impact.  Indeed, it is perhaps most fair to see When Worlds Collide as a film that moves completely beyond the political, rising to the heights of archetype, religion, and myth.

Despite the defects on the film, on DVD it comes across as a colorful and fairly sharp picture. Sound is only mono. There are no extras.This film dared to tackle the difficult question of what we would do if astromomers found a fast-moving star/planet system heading directly for Earth, and one large enough to destroy us.  We have about 8 months, and the only hope for mankind as we know it is to quickly build a spaceship, select about 44 people to go along, plus a good variety of various types of livestock, blast off right before Earth is destroyed, attempt to land on the new planet, and hope that the atmosphere will support life.  Quite a lot to ask for, especially in 1951!As with other sci-fi films of that generation, you have the straightforward, unsmiling scientists, you have the wheelchair-bound selfish rich guy who will finance the spacecraft if he can save his own skin, you have the beautiful young lady who has no greater purpose than creating love tension among two of the main protagonists, and you have the kid rescued with his dog off a rooftop.The film's strength is neither the Earth's destruction nor the arrival on the new planet. Rather it is the interplay among the scientists, governing bodies, and common folk wrestling with the idea that our home, Earth, may be destroyed and what we can or should do about it. What a concept, what a slim margin for error.  New wall calendars are printed, and as each day is peeled off, you see how much time is left before the destruction. Signs posted at the spacecraft construction site say Waste anything but time. Time is our most valuable resource. When the space travelers are chosen by lottery, one man chooses to stay behind because his fiance' can't go. Some angry non-winners begin to revolt. major SPOILER - As the Earth is being destroyed, the spaceship starts gliding down its mile-long ramp (never mind the bad physics here) and then upwards into space. Later, while running out of fuel, they manage to make an awkward but safe landing on what now has to be their new home. There can be no escape. While one says let's test the atmosphere before we open the door, the brave pilot says, it's the only air we have, it doesn't matter as he opens the door, then says, It's the best air I've ever breathed.

Based on the concept of an Armageddon-type disaster, it is a foreplay for modern movies like Armageddon, Deep Impact, and others similar to them. This movie, like all others, contains both correct and incorrect science. One bit of correct science is the Differential Analyzer. This machine is essentially an enormous and complex calculator bordering on modern day computers. This machine, as every school child in America can tell you, is very practical. However, incorrect science appears to be more dominant when compared to correct science. First and foremost in the incorrect science category is the spaceship that is constructed. The size of the ship and the materials available at that time period (mainly less advanced isotopes of metals) indicate that it would be in excess of 7,000 tons! In addition, the design of the spaceship appears to be impractical for it to be able to land on an alien planet (the ship isn't even equipped with wheels or ski-like landing gear to allow it to land. Another note, when the viewers are shown the inside of the spaceship there is at least two dozen feet of head room. If the creators wanted to bring as many people or as much supplies as possible, shouldn't that room be used for additional fuel, people, knowledge, or food?Another bit of incorrect science is the statement that Bellus had traveled one million miles in two weeks but also traversed three billion miles in under a year (if Bellus traveled one million miles for one year it would traverse 52 million miles, not three billion miles). Overall, I rate this movie a 6 out of 10. It boasts a good plot which streches our imaginations. In addition, the idea of not only flying to another world but landing and creating a new society, is far-reaching (space flight only begins in that era and the exploration of other planets doesn't come for a few dozen years). However, the graphics are poor, especially the landscape of Zyra, which appears to be a cartoon drawing. Also, the movie, in my opinion at least, revolves to strongly around Dave and Joyce instead of on the destruction and obliteration of Earth. Therefore, although I recommend this movie to scifi viewers, I do it with hesitations and the reminder that this is a movie created over 50 years ago.

What is interesting when you compare this film to say Deep Impact, made almost 50 years later, is the fact that the original, When Worlds Collide got it right for the most part. The special effects were remarkable as well when you consider no computer animation existed at the time and so much was done with miniatures. The spaceship was also a very remarkable in that it did not stretch credibility. The design and even the method of launching was accurate with the best projected future engineering of the day. However, would such a spaceship really be able to be constructed using late 1940s, early 50s technology? This craft was about the size of a NASA Space Shuttle. I had read that if the Space Shuttle was fitted with a passenger compartment, it could carry about 45 people. Again the writers and directors got it right. I wonder if anyone knows if Werner Von Braun was a consultant on this film? The really improbable part however is that one of the two planets (the one that does not strike the Earth) has an oxygen- nitrogen atmosphere and a surface gravity identical to that of the Earth, perfect to set up housekeeping on for a rebirth of humanity. I also like the idea that the film does not sacrifice story line and drama for special effects. As in a later disaster from space film Meteor, remember to keep watching the sky!

It's also one of the earliest depictions of the end-of-the-world scenario since it was based on a 1932 novel. While the premise was interesting and there were some cool effects for a '50s Technicolor movie, there's the formula girl has to choose between two men that seemed par for the course in many of these genre flicks. The best performance was that of John Hoyt as the billionaire who finances the rocket move after the government turns scientist Larry Keating down. Richard Derr and Barbara Rush are the adequately compelling leads. Besides Keating who was the fourth Harry Morton on Burns and Allen, other familiar faces from later TV series include Hayden Rorke from I Dream of Jeanne (though it took a while before I recognized him since he wore a beard here) and Frank Cady from Petticoat Junction and Green Acres (though again he wasn't easily spotted without his mustache or gravelly voice). If you're a sci-fi fan of Pal, this film is worth a look. Just don't expect too much in the way of logic.

Adaptations of popular books in the 50's included former German rocket scientist Willy Ley's Conquest Of Space using designs and ideas illustrated by space artist Chestley Bonestell, who's work is seen in almost all of Pal's space films in one way or another, considered cutting edge for the time. His others included H.G.Wells classic War Of The Worlds, Robert Heinlein's Destination Moon and the Edwin Balmer & Philip Wylie 1932 novel When World's Collide.The results still stand as seminal classics of science fiction filmwork, often copied, referenced and paid homage in one way or another. Although perhaps dated by the computer generated, digitally enhanced SFX of today's so-called masterpieces, these films still stand out as the major influences which helped shape our dream, visions and often spoke to our deepest fears, such as the end of the world. From the inverted ski jump launch system (used today on aircraft carriers), to expendable booster rockets (a Space Shuttle standard), the Ark spaceship spawned the imagination of many filmakers, including some who reused the model for other films such as Flight To Mars and The Queen Of Outer Space. The movie still stands as a milestone as the first science fiction disaster movie.Once again, Leith Stevens' musical score enriches the experience, as it did for Pal's previous space adventure, Destination Moon. The film's special effects won it the Oscar in 1951. All this, and in the rich tones of Technicolor that shall never been seen in a first run movie theater again. Thank you Lord for revival houses that still manage to seek out old time prints for festivals (the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin, Texas comes to mind).There still remains a bit of controversy, though, about the film's ending. A wide, panoramic Bonestell matte painting is seen from the hatch of the newly arrived Ark. In the image can be seen two clearly pyramidal mountains in perfect proportions, as if artificial, as well as the base of what appears to be a building constructed by an alien intelligence. Although the actors don't react to this (the matte effect added in post production), the artwork hints at the planet Zyra as being inhabited (In the novel, the planet is known as Bronson Beta, and is indeed found to be once inhabited, and is explored further in the sequel After Worlds Collide).In the 1970s, producers Richard Zanuck and David Brown attempted to do a remake, which eventually mutated into the 1998 film, Deep Impact. As in When Worlds Collide, the human interaction was as important as the science fiction elements. "},{"Title":"Dr. Frye, says Dr. Hendron, notice the position of these new bodies. Yes, says Dr. Frye, yes, I see.","Date":"22 April 2009","Score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Family, Sci-Fi","Review":" There was a time, long, long ago, when teachers taught their young students to crouch under their desks for protection if the Russians lobbed nuclear bombs into the town square. There was a time when kids would look at the marvelously detailed galactic paintings by Chesley Bonestell and rush to read more science fiction stories. There was a time when the human hand, not computers, created special effects in movies that made kids go Wow! George Pal's When Worlds Collide, based on the science fiction novel by Edwin Balmer and Philip Wylie, may seem dated to today's jaded crowds fed on computer-generated excess, but give your inner young teen a chance to enjoy this good movie. It's all about, of course, an attempt to save a remnant of humanity from oblivion by whisking them off in an untried rocket ship to a new planet. Astronomers have determined that Bellus, a star a dozen times larger than our own, is hurtling through the cosmos directly at earth. Circling Bellus is a new planet, Zyra. This planet will sweep past Earth bringing cataclysmic disaster. Then Bellus, days later, will obliterate Earth. A small group of scientists plan to build a space ship that will leave Earth just before Bellus hits and travel to Zyra, which, it is calculated, will be captured by the sun's gravitational pull and settle in to an orbit similar to what Earth's was. The rocket will only be able to take 44 men and women, plus a selection of animals and plants. Humanity's skills, dedication, selflessness...and ruthless desperation...will be tested to the full. Among the people we'll get to know are Dr. Cole Hendron (Larry Keating), a wise scientist who heads the project and who sounds like an avuncular radio announcer; his daughter, Joyce (Barbara Rush), conflicted by her love for two men and evidently a recent graduate of the Ann Blythe School of Self-Consciously Gracious Acting; Dave Randall (Richard Derr), pilot, adventurer and a man who discovers he loves Joyce; Dr. Tony Drake (Peter Hansen), a man who also loves Joyce who must make a decision only he can make; and, best of all, Sydney Stanton (John Hoyt), an immensely rich businessman, confined to a wheelchair, whose idea of humanity would make a pride of lions at feeding time look like pussycats. He will fund the project if he gets a seat on the ship. He also brings rifles along to the building site. Your salvation doesn't interest me; mine does, he snarls at Dr. Hendron. When Worlds Collide offers up two great pleasures. First, the story hums along. Except for a lull in the middle when we have to deal with the Joyce-Dave-Tony triangle, there are no slow or dull spots. Granted, building a rocket ship in the mountains may not seem exciting, but the movie establishes the rush to get it done before Bellus hits. We also get to deal with the disasters that occur when Zyra speeds by. Rudolf Mate, the director, keeps his foot on the accelerator. The second and best pleasure comes from the model work of George Pal. With no computers to make improbable disasters mundane, Pal gives us meticulous handmade models and special photography that stops us in our tracks. Just the work on the huge rocket ship, poised at the top of a ramp that sweeps down into a valley and then up the side of a mountain, is enormously satisfying. Pal and his memorable models give us everything we could hope for exploding volcanoes with white-hot lava moving right towards us, oceans roaring across the land, buildings crushed, Manhattan seriously awash, a dramatic send-off of the rocket ship, and a hopeful look at humanity's new planet, combining snow, green- carpeted hills and some unusually tall and weird flowers. Sure, the acting and the actors are all B-movie quality. The brief angst of the three-way romance is small stuff by today's Jen-Brad-Angie standards. The optimistic science is sketchy at best. The movie now seems more than a little naive. Well, so what? It moves quickly, looks great and it sure beats crouching under your desk waiting to be incinerated.

This is a big production, an A-list science fiction movie! It is also an excellent end of the world adventure. But for me, this movie has a special place in my heart because it has the coolest silver rocket ever to fly in the era just prior to actual space travel -when all rockets were cigar shaped, V-2 derived, silver rockets. Ah! The golden age of the silver rockets! The earth appears to be on a collision course with a sun and planetary body, Bellarus and Zyra respectively. There are debates in the UN about the scientific evidence and whether it is conclusive that a collision will occur. (Ah, what hopes people had back then, of the UN as an authoritative body! A world with science at the core of rational decisions and scientists as the most powerful spokespersons). Many attendees scoff at the conclusion put forward by Dr. Hendron that a collision will occur. His proposed solution is to build fleets of rocket ships to fly colonists to the planet Zyra in hopes of surviving the destruction of planet earth. A few are apparently convinced, and some countries go off and attempt to build their own rockets (we never hear much of their efforts). But it is clear that there will be no organized global effort to build rocket ships. Indeed, it is debated whether rockets can be used for interplanetary travel at all! With the help of a few humanitarian capitalists, Dr. Hendron begins work on a really great looking rocket. It is designed to take off using a sled and rail for added boost, fly through space, and land like a aircraft on the planet Zyra. It is just like the Space Shuttle in concept, only better looking. This is one nifty looking rocket. The ongoing construction of this rocket is the true star of the show. Everything else, plot and character and conflict, revolve around this rocket. Of course, the ship is a Noah's Ark, built to carry a few remnants of humanity and animals to a new world. There are some interesting elements at work in this movie. How do the builders of this modern day Noah's Ark act? Turns out they respond just like Americans did 6-7 years before this movie, at the height of WWII, at the height of American industrial effort. I love watching the construction scenes, the humanitarian contributions of the wealthy capitalists, the self sacrifice and 'can do' spirit that pervaded WWII. The little signs by every calendar and clock which state, 'Waste Anything Except TIME. Time is Our Shortest Material', so like WWII era industrialism. And just like WWII, women are hard at work in the factory. True, they are secondary assistants or technicians, but they are there, holding real jobs, an opportunity women rarely had prior to the war.The characters are one dimensional, stock figures. Perhaps they have to be, there is too much going on in terms of plot and events to develop complex characters. Even so, this is the weakest part of the movie. No one stands out. One exception is the villainous and tyrannical capitalist, Stanton, who is providing much of the finance for this project. In return, he gets to be one of the lucky 40 or so passengers on the ship. He provides most of the energy and emotion in this film. The woman, Joyce Hendron, also stands out, not so much for what she does on screen, but what she represents. She is the new, successful, modern woman of the 1950s. She is smart, and can use a DA (Differential Analyser - a room sized machine probably with all the computing power of a modern calculator), she is confident, capable, and she dresses in snappy and professional work suits. Unfortunately, her character falls into a fairly benign choice between two romantic partners - a doctor and a fly-boy. There are some interesting moral issues in the story. Only 40 people will fit on the rocket. Who gets to go? It ends up a mix of random selection from the rocket factory workers and a hand picked 5-6 people. It is interesting to watch the choices of the picks. For the audience of the time period, the selection process would probably have been viewed as enlightened and fair. It is also interesting to see the self sacrifice and 'for the good of the team' attitudes that mostly prevail. These attitudes would have been comfortable to post-war audiences. Finally, the star and planet loom close and the earth begins to fall apart in earthquakes, floods, volcanoes and the like. This is a very impressive and a well-done segment of the movie. At the very end of the world, just before the rocket takes off, social order breaks down. Just as the tyrant Stanton predicted, a mob is coming for the rocket. They are too late. The rocket blasts off just in time and flies into space, with satisfying visual effects. Has this movie stood the test of time? Can modern viewers watch it and enjoy it? Based on some of the reviews I've read here at IMDb, I dunno. The end of the world and avoiding the extinction of humanity with a desperate gamble of flying to an unknown planet in a rocket is a compelling story. For myself, weak characters and dated outlooks are counterbalanced with the coolest silver rocket ever.

For such a classic piece of 50s sci-fi 'When Worlds Collide' has been woefully neglected. Surely the releasing company could have found someone to provide a commentary, or even a featurette, couldn't they? The only extra on the disc is a trailer, one lousy trailer. But that's the most this particular company usually provide(I'm not going to name names, those who read this review will know who I'm referring to anyway), with the exception of 'Forrest Gump'. There they gave us a double disc release, worthy of the trouble the filmmakers went to to get Forrest(Tom Hanks) in with such historical personages. But this is a review for 'When Worlds Collide', not 'Forrest Gump'.Possible Spoilers follow...Now I saw this film at the tender age of seven when it first came out(I'll let you work out my age from that clue yourselves). I was blown away by not only the storyline which, to a highly susceptible seven-year-old, was the most frightening thing ever, but by the special effects--especially the much-derided last scene as well as the flooding of New York and other various sequences of nature running amok. Incidentally did anyone notice(in that last scene on Zyra), a futuristic city in the distance, almost on the horizon? Perhaps they were going to do a sequel about how the various refugees survived on Zyra(did they meet other Zyrans? Were there indeed any Zyrans?).One other point; occasionally there have been references to high body counts in films(either on-screen or off) but this one has them all beat. There can be nothing higher, body-wise, than the destruction of an entire planet(the original Star Wars(1977) comes pretty close when the Death Star obliterates Alderaan but there is a definite population on Earth whereas Alderaan's is unknown. Go and ask George if he knows).So what is left to say about 'When Worlds Collide'? I find nothing wrong with the acting, special effects nor the story-line. Simply put, the movie is everything I came to expect from the 50s and is one of the best sci-fi movies of an entire century. Forget 'Armageddon' or 'Deep Impact' (although I prefer the latter to the former since it stars a pre-Frodo performance by the extremely talented Elijah Wood), this one has them beat by more than the standard mile--more like a couple of hundred miles! All in all this is a film worth studying on how to make a really fine movie. And, until that company release a 'Special Edition' DVD, I will hang on to my extras-light disc.My verdict 10/10. A winner all the way!

Thank God, sensible people were able to take control in this very harrowing time.Also during the 50's and 60's (perhaps even the 70's and onwards), people would predict the end of the world at such and such a time.

During the cold war, we were in control and possibly some nut could press the button.However in this movie, we have a real frightening situation where a runaway planet (asteroid) is speeding towards the earth on an imminent collision course.

Admittedly not as good a movie, mainly for its breathtaking ignorance of planetary physics. Yes, please tides are not just oceanic but geological; the earth's crust would have been ripped apart by such a close pass of a Mars size body. The other factor was its Cold War bluntness about Human Nature while epistemologically accurate it was not well received by movie viewers. Wheelchair bound Hoyt predicts misanthropically the havoc to come when Bellus approaches. I still recommend it to you for its unique story of leaving the earth for an unknown planet; it is part Noah's Ark mixed in with the rush for completion before our world is destroyed. The lottery held adds a touch of Fate to the outcome though the director bends this a bit for romantic reasons to take the edge off of chance's cruelty. What will surprise young viewers is that the effects are on the level of War Of The Worlds. We have a lesser cast here with the exception of Hoyt and the head scientist whom nobody, in typical fashion, listens to until it is almost too late. As in Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea, he is labeled a crackpot and only the cynical, crippled, business magnate will heed his warning.Even here, he is not convinced but is just reserving himself a spot, just in case. What is interesting about the movie is the cultural contrast between the optimism of human nature shown in 2012 where they open up the Arks for the poor and here where the predicted bedlam ensues just as Hoyt asserted it would to the optimistic, disbelieving scientists. The Cold War was such an antithetical time to our present Zeitgeist. You will never see a starker view of humanity in an old classic science fiction than here. It is evocative of the scene in the War Of The Worlds where the martians heat ray a priest right in the middle of the 23rd Psalm. This is because the aliens or, in this case, the threat is magnified to the Red Scare proportions. This sense of ominous foreboding was what it was like to live under MAD Mutually Assured Destruction. The terror buried in millions' unconsciousness is why you see the left out turn to murderous rioters at the end. The ship barely escapes the people who built it making them as great a danger as the natural one.If you collect old science fictions, I would start with The Day The Earth Stood Still, War Of The Worlds and Forbidden Planet before I bought this. I have it in my collection but it is still a lesser work. It has moments of SDD Science Deficit Disorder that even prompted audiences in the 80's to speak Oh, give me a break, come on!

And that the film was entirely fictitious. I've always found it incredible that some people could still be so credulous in the '60's and that it appears the opposite is usually true nowadays.Two rogue planets are discovered to be on a close pass/collision course with Earth, dedicated scientist-brains lead dedicated teams to plan and build rocket to hopefully transport and save a few lucky surviving humans to the new world. Laid out in a typical Hollywood soap opus style with an icky love story and oodles of self-sacrifice in the face of impending hideous mass death it still grips - it's open simplicity saves it from being either a cornfest or boring. Although it's been dated for over 40 years it's still interesting for its procession of stereotypical people and emotions and the range of allegorical situations presented. With but a single moralisation stemming from the two jealous love rivals, boxes of urgent medical supplies are flown to a stranded group of people that everyone including us know are all going to be incinerated in a few days.

I emphasise the word theory as the science behind the Golden Age of sci-fi was generally rather loopy, though the films were happy to make heroes of scientists. They were no more self-isolated lunatics cooking up destructive experiments or digging up corpses to make a monster, but wise, goateed intellectuals, or square-jawed protégées capable of saving humanity from any potential threats. Of course, the 1950's mainly gave us rubber-suited aliens or giant, mutated monsters, but there were a few directors and producers that were aiming to give the audience a more satisfying, thoughtful experience, such as Rudolph Mate's When Worlds Collide.After scientists discover that there are a pair of rogue planets hurtling towards Earth, pilot David Randall (Richard Derr) is given the task of delivering the information to New York for further research. When Dr. Cole Hendron (Larry Keating) confirms the fear, the news is brought to the attention of the United Nations, where they are laughed out as crackpots. It is believed that the first planet will pass so close to the Earth, it will cause devastating damage, only return from its orbit of the Sun to destroy Earth completely. With the help of Sydney Stanton (John Hoyt), who provides the funds, Hendron and his colleagues begin work on a spacecraft that will transport a small band of survivors to the second planet, which they believe is habitable and will remain on a stable orbit.Rather than giving us special-effects filled set-pieces or killer aliens, When Worlds Collide entirely focuses on humanity's reaction to potential catastrophe. The story is an obvious parable of Noah's Ark, with God venting his fury upon the Earth he saw as fallen into sin, and this theme comes to fruition near towards the end as a lottery-system is drafted to choose who stays and who goes, with the inevitable violent rebellion of those facing death. This harsh depiction of the human race was the most intriguing idea the film had, which makes it sad that the film-makers failed to capitalise on it, instead focuses on a dull love story between Randall, Hendron's daughter Joyce (Barbara Rush) and Dr. Tony Drake (Peter Hansen).The film was successful and went to be hugely influential in the genre, but it is held back from being anything great by some gaping plot-holes, lazy plot devices, and some erratic special effects. It took home to Academy Awards for Special Effects, but the new world reveal at the climax is a rather hastily painted backdrop, ruining any sense of wonder the ending may have provided. There is plenty of fun to be had with When Worlds Collide and gave many future writers and directors to think about, but producer George Pal funded better and more satisfying sci-fi in The War of the Worlds (1953) and The Time Machine (1960).www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com "}{"Title":"August 12","Date":"12 April 2012","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Family, Sci-Fi","Review":" Hayden Rorke and his team of astronomers in Johannesburg, South Africa discover a star and an accompanying orbiting planet are on a direct course for our solar system. In a year they will hit earth. Rorke dispatches Richard Derr to his colleague Larry Keating in the USA for confirmation. It's true the worlds will collide in about a year on August 12. When Worlds Collide is the story of a few scientists and their efforts to save mankind by taking a few over to that orbiting planet Zaira which will pass close before the star itself overwhelms earth with heat before the collision itself. It is mentioned that other countries are undertaking rocket building, but When Worlds Collide concentrates on the USA where the claims are met with derision by the scientific community so Keating and colleagues go out on their own. The main financial sponsor is multi-millionaire John Hoyt who believes his millions entitle him to some special consideration. The conflict between Keating and Hoyt is what drive the film.Below that there is a subplot involving Richard Derr and Keating's daughter Barbara Rush. He breaks in and steals her away from Peter Hansen who also works with Keating. The lack of name players gives a bit of realism to When Worlds Collide although these character actors are a pretty familiar lot. When Worlds Collide has come down to us via its reputation for its special effects because of the deserved Oscar it won. But director Rudolph Mate got good performances from his cast.It never ceases to amaze me how the invention of the computer is never factored in and it certainly was thought about and invented very shortly although those early machines were big. Among the necessary items thought for survival were books, the Bible, Principia Mathematica and the Encyclopedia Britannica. These of course would all be on discs now. This is the third science fiction film from roughly the same era and none of them imagined that one.Although the concepts are dated and the science fiction a bit flawed, When Worlds Collide still has great entertainment value.

They are mainly youngsters, but standing outside the ship is the venerable scientist who conceived the survival project and the rich (but nasty) industrialist who paid for it. The ship is slightly over-weight and with seconds to go before launch, the scientist chooses to give the youngsters a better chance by refusing to board. The industrialist is terrified, and makes a supreme effort to stand and to get on board - but too late. The hatch closes, the engines fire, the ship departs.

That having been said, however, let me hasten to add that When Worlds Collide is an enjoyable movie.  The special effects of a half-century ago are still impressive, and the film's commentary on human nature is rather incisive.  On the science and technology side of the ledger, however, the movie is seriously lacking, and the book does a much better job of discussing the technical difficulties involved in any kind of evacuation from Earth and the reseeding of the human race on another planet.  Also, the collision between Earth and the star Bellus is a complete disappointment.John Hoyt's performance as self-seeking and cynical billionaire Sidney Stanton is the best in the movie.  He doesn't overplay the part, but mixes the right proportion of facial gestures and acidic voice inflection to give his wheelchair-bound character a completely believable profile.  He is the real star of the movie.  The other performances are adequate, but lack the depth of Hoyt's.  The movie could have used another thirty minutes to fully develop both the storyline and the other characters because a theme like this needs two hours or so to fulfill itself.Many have criticized the Disney-like final scene as the survivors of Earth's end walk onto the soil of the new world Zyra.  To be fair to Pal, the production was rushed at the end to meet budget costs and what was put forward was the best that could be done in a limited time.  Pal also intended to film a sequel After Worlds Collide, in line with what the book had, to continue the story.  Unfortunately, Paramount Pictures scotched that, and no sequel was ever made.  Pal carried that disappointment to his grave.I'd like to see When Worlds Collide made into a movie again.  Despite Deep Impact and other movies like it, When Worlds Collide stands as the ultimate disaster movie, and with today's technology, a much better version than George Pal's could be made.  A sequel should also be done as was the case with the original book to bring the story to a logical conclusion.  For now, however, all we have is the 1951 film, and it still holds up well and will reward viewers who appreciate thrilling adventure.

The technical people who worked on this movie did a wonderful job with all the technology involved, but they stuffed up in one fundamental area. The outfits, (I cannot call them space-suits), worn by the crew and all the passengers who fly in the rocket-ship would not be nearly enough protection for a trip into space. They are simply overalls, (complete with draw-strings at the neck!), and black beanies. In the real situation of moving form one planet to another, one would have to wear a full space-suit as protection against any eventuality. I guess that the producers must have run out of money!

Verbal conflict arises with politicians skeptical of the scientific predictions, and with ordinary people (all of them American, apparently) who fight to be on-board the escaping craft.The plot has lots of back-and-forth banter that is heavy on melodrama and apocalyptic dialogue. This is a very talky film. And, in the midst of this doom scenario, a love triangle erupts between two guys and a scientist's daughter. Characters are heavily stereotyped, and not particularly interesting. The story's breathy ending, after a year of doom talk, is anything but doom ridden.Given what we know now, the film's science is not all that accurate. But it is more accurate for the era in which it was made, than some recent sci-fi films. Nor can we fault the film for dated sets and antiquated scientific equipment.

I wonder what audiences 50 years from now will think of current popular movies.A brief note on the scientific plausibility of the premise of the movie i.e. the collision of the earth with another star. To give some readers an idea of how unlikely this could be according to astronomer Paolo Maffei in his book Beyond the Moon; if our Sun was the size of a basketball, the Earth would be about the size of a BB 40 feet away with the outermost planets about 260 feet away. On this scale, Alpha Centauri (the next closest star to our Sun) would be 40 miles away. And this is a distance between stars that is typical in our part of the galaxy.

Actually they're pretty good for 1950, when the film was shot. And the story kind of sweeps you up as it moves along, rather as if you'd been standing in front of some porn shop on 42nd Street when the tsunami roared through Times Square.But, fellas and girls, you have to suspend your disbelief big time to not laugh at this one. A group of scientists who insist on calling each other doctor discover that there is a star with a planet in orbit around it, and both are headed towards Earth. The closeness of the planet will cause major disasters before the star smashes into Earth and obliterates it in its entirety. Earth's population is in a hopeless position, with no place to hide. There is no escarpment. But there is a small chance that a couple of dozen humans along with animals and cultigens may escape in a space ship and land on the new star's planet where, they hope and pray, the conditions will be livable.So who's going to get to go? We'll skip the scientific stuff because, although it may all be wildly conjectural, I don't know enough to comment on it. Well, I guess I can say, speaking as a semi-scientist, that if I were to stock a space ship as if it were Noah's Ark, and if every ounce counted, I would take very young goats instead of fully grown goats -- and eggs rather than chickens. The egg always comes before the chicken.The protagonist, the everyday kind of guy the audience is supposed to identify with, is Richard Derr, a blond man who acts in the same way that a pointer indicates the location of a game bird -- Psst. Right there. He looks too much like Danny Kaye for most of us to identify with him since, after all, the majority of male viewers, like me, more closely resemble Cary Grant.But, be that as it may, casting may have made some errors here and there but Barbara Rush isn't one of them. Wow. She looked so gorgeous in a very American way, and continued to do so for years afterward, up to and including Hombre. Why she and Derr, who describes himself accurately as no more than an aerial taxi driver, fall for each other and foul up the affair between Rush and an honest doctor, I don't know. I believe that when there are only eleven days left before the total destruction of the planet, she is still fussing over which guy she should marry, the honest doc or the lowbrow rogue she loves. Eleven days left and she's worried about being happy for the rest of her life.It could be argued that if the term stereotypical applied to anything at all, the characters in this film would qualify -- the earnest scientist/father, the devoted humane daughter, the self-sacrificing doctor, the adventuresome but modest pilot, the arrogant selfish millionaire, the two innocent young lovers, the humble but honest goats, the constantly bickering chickens, the cows in their unashamedly stupid rusticity, the dildo-shaped space ship eager to get going.And the story plays false with its own values. The murderous and cowardly millionaire who funds the project (played by Hoyt, who did a fine job in MGM's Julius Caesar) isn't allowed to choose anyone to accompany him on the dicey space trip. Every passenger is chosen by lot, except those who are necessary to the trip's successful completion. And we're all for excluding this snarling rich guy. But the rules are violated in order to include Barbara Rush, though her only job has been passing out sandwiches to the work crew. Why? Because her scientist/father is the chief organizer and he loves her. And Richard Derr is bootlegged aboard too. Why? Because SHE loves HIM. Absolutely nothing is made of this chink in the lottery. It's presented with the blessings of the producers.Well, the script can't be swallowed anyway. The night he finds out that the Earth will be destroyed, Richard Derr and Barbara Rush go to a night club. He gets tipsy and begins lighting cigarettes with ten-dollar bills while she gazes at him admiringly, and the scene ends with them chuckling together over the fact that money means nothing anymore. If someone informed you, right now, that the planet would be destroyed in a few weeks and everyone on Earth was doomed, is that what you would be doing tonight? Still, this thing is so simple minded and the effects so spectacular for their day that it's worth watching. Nothing, not even the threat of the destruction of the planet, would get me to reveal whether the escape attempt was successful or not.

Inserted into the picture was a romantic triangle of sorts that managed to work itself out over the course of the story, but it's not something I'm interested in watching a sci-fi flick. Don't get me wrong, the movie isn't terrible by any means, for example it doesn't approach First Spaceship on Venus territory. But when you have a film that conjures up an image of destruction on a massive scale it ought to deliver something along those lines. If only the script had used the word 'azimuth' in any of the scientific calculations coming out of the differential analyzer, I could have thrown in a bonus point in my rating of the picture. Instead, Dr. Tony Drake (Peter Hansen) had this weird patch of brown in the back of his otherwise full head of black hair. Never mind, those two items cross each other out.

Zyra will pass close enough to the Earth to cause massive tidal waves and catastrophic earthquakes, but Bellus will destroy our planet completely. With funding from several wealthy businessmen, a team of scientists led by Dr. Cole Hendron (Larry Keating) set about constructing a Space Ark, a rocket-ship capable of ferrying a small group of lucky survivors to Zyra before the Bellus crashes into the Earth. As the deadline approaches, plucky airplane pilot David Randall (Richard Derr) falls for Hendon's beautiful daughter Joyce (Barbara Rush), much to the consternation of her current beau Dr. Tony Drake (Peter Hansen).With its blend of cheesy emotional drama, silly scientific conjecture, and spectacular cataclysmic disaster, When World's Collide is the epitome of '50s pulp sci-fi cinema and also the template for many an apocalyptic disaster flick. The formulaic relationship between Dave Randall and Joyce impedes the action a little too much, but when the time comes for the proverbial to hit the fan, the film definitely delivers, with special effects laden set-pieces that still hold up well today (and which deservedly won the film an Oscar) and a particularly great-looking spacecraft, The Space Ark typically '50s in fashion, with sleek, windowless, silver fuselage and stubby wings. The film also benefits from a memorable villain&#x97;malicious, wheelchair-bound multi-millionaire Sydney Stanton (played with relish by John Hoyt).A lame shot of Zyra's landscape (a flat painted backdrop) ends matters on a slightly bum note, but it's the journey, not the destination, that makes this film so much fun.

(And Shouldn't It Be Getting Hot As The Star Approaches?)","Date":"7 November 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Family, Sci-Fi","Review":" I found myself wondering why it wasn't getting pretty darn hot on earth? It didn't seem to be. But - shouldn't it have been? I mean, the story tells us that there's a star - A STAR! - approaching the earth that's eventually going to collide with our planet and destroy us. A STAR!! Well, stars are pretty darn hot, you know. But as this one gets close to earth, our little blue planet doesn't really seem to heat up. I mean, this star called Bellus is called at one point a giant star - even though it's described as only a dozen times bigger than the earth, which actually makes it a lot smaller than the sun as well as a few of the larger planets in our solar system. But surely it would still be hot - if only because it's a star! Oh well. Go figure.It's 50's sci-fi. You can't take it too seriously. Some call this a sci-fi classic. I wouldn't go that far. In fact, I didn't even think it was especially good. Certainly, I've seen 50's sci-fi stuff that was more enjoyable. The attempts at science really threw me. When Bellus and its planet Zyra are discovered, it was noted that they had moved a million miles in two weeks. Which doesn't really seem that fast to me in interstellar terms. I wondered how this star approaching our solar system could have gone unnoticed until it was only three billion miles away (which would have put it well within the bounds of our own solar system.) A lot just seemed pretty strange. Of course, it might have just been that George Pal and his pals who made this realized that your average movie goer in 1951 probably wasn't all that up on astronomy, so they figured they could get away with it. It just bothered me all the way through, though.So, basically, this is a doomsday movie - and it's even introduced with a reference to the story of Noah and the ark from the Bible. And it's replete with the scepticism that always surrounds doomsday preachers, with good reason since they've all been wrong so far. But Dr. Hendron isn't wrong. He knows. Bellus will crush us unless we figure out a way to - well - get out of the way. So, conveniently, Bellus has this planet Zyra that might be able to support human life, so - what the heck - even though we only have a few months we'll build a giant spaceship and transport a few dozen people (and some puppies to make the little boy who hitched a ride happy) to this new world. OK. For the most part, everyone seems pretty calm about the coming apocalypse, although there is some panic at the end, and there was no real logic to how people were selected to be among the few dozen. Aside from a handful of hand picked folks, everybody else was just drawn by lot. There's a romance involved in this - because the end of the world should never get in the way of love - and it's passing strange that flying from Earth to Zyra is a little bit like flying from New York to Chicago - just get in your seat, fasten your seatbelt, and enjoy the ride. No word on whether there were complimentary snacks along the way.No. I didn't care much for this. 50's Sci-fi classic? Meh. I've seen better. To give credit where credit is due, though, I did like the special effects. I thought the scenes in which a major city (New York?) was flooded was quite well done. I did think they could have done a little better with the depiction of the surface of Zyra though. I waited through to the end, confident that they'd make it to Zyra and hoping to get a glimpse of what the new world would look like - and as it turned out it looked like it was painted on a canvass by a 7 year old.

I wonder...","Date":"4 May 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Family, Sci-Fi","Review":" Astronomers predict that a world (or rather a sun) will collide with Earth, destroying everything &#x96; effectively wiping out the human race. This world/sun is Bellus, but before that happens, another planet, Zyra, will pass close by earth. This near-collision will result in earthquakes and tsunamis.Dave Randall (Richard Derr), a rogue and pilot, is paid to take the secret information of earth's doom to London, to scientists that are going to verify the terrible information. The information turns out to be correct and the scientists start to plan their escape from earth. They hope that it is possible to fly into space and land on Zyra, which will (hopefully) be suitable for humans.Randall suddenly finds himself in the middle of this whole affair, in love with the daughter of one of the scientists. This may also be his ticket aboard the ship to Zyra. However, Randall may be a rogue, but he also has a conscience. When it is time to choose which 40 people will make the journey, Randall gives up his seat. He does not feel that he has earned the right, that there are other more worthy people to take the seat.This might be so, but when the time comes to leave earth, Randall finds an unlikely ally that may help him out in the hour of need&#x85;When Worlds Collide is an old movie. It certainly has a story that it wish to explore, but with today's knowledge, the thought of a planet (or maybe even two) crashing into earth seems&#x85; ludicrous. Sure, a comet, asteroid or even a meteor would have been fine, but two planets passing through earth's orbit within a month&#x85; I don't think so. Of course, I am not a scientist nor an astronomer.I know this movie was made in a different time, but I can't help but wonder about the reactions of the people when they hear that earth is doomed. I would have thought that people would panic, but they don't, only in the very last second when Bellus is within a stone's throw. Sure, they might not believe in the information, but they must when the big red thing gets closer. To destroy earth is a pretty reckless thing, I don't think a little emotion is too much to ask.Another thing that really annoyed me. The ending. I don't mind the people reaching Zyra, nor that the planet is suitable for humans. What really annoys me was the use of a painted landscape. This might not have looked fake back in 1951 (although I think it did, unless the movie was in black and white originally), but it does today and when the landscape looks distinctly like earth, I can't help but wonder if they couldn't have found a real location somewhere, like in Asia? I won't even comment on the strange climate zones on Zyra (heavy snow and then 50 ft. away&#x85; a beautiful green meadow).Was there nothing that I liked in this movie? There certainly was. The character of Dave Randall, for one. He feels real and seems disturbed by the thought of dying in so young age. He acts cool, but also human when disaster strikes. I also liked the pace of the movie. Strangely enough, the movie does keep you entertained, maybe for the wrong reasons (the movie is quite funny), but still.As far as references go, there is a scene where New York is flooded, which reminded me of The Day After Tomorrow (Roland Emmerich, 2004), but also of 2012 (Roland Emmerich, 2009), where the humans built an ark of their own, only this one isn't supposed to leave earth. Of course the last is a biblical reference.Lastly, I just saw that they are working on a new When Worlds Collide movie which is supposed to hit the cinemas in 2012. I can only hope that it is better than the original.

After such first-rate George Pal special effects as a tidal wave rushing down a Manhattan boulevard, this cardboard backdrop came as a near insult. Now, so many decades later, I come to find out, courtesy IMDb, that this misfire was the studio's fault and not the estimable Pal's. It was a long time coming, but I am somehow relieved.The movie's star, of course, are the special effects, probably as good (with the one exception) as any from that sci-fi soaked decade. Nonetheless, the cast, especially Rush (Joyce) is livelier than usual, along with John Hoyt (Stanton) doing his usual cruel-faced menace, trying to buy his way aboard the rocket propelled ark. There's a ton of heavy human interest drama implicit in the plight of the millions left behind, but the script perhaps wisely skips over that potential since it would point the movie in a much heavier direction, as though the end of the world is not heavy enough.Anyway, this Paramount production remains an entertaining visual treat even if the effects have long been surpassed in our digital age.

They appeared in the dozens. Unfortunately; they were mostly of the cheap thrill style. Science fiction was still very much a subject for nerds, not mainstream. Directors didn't take the subject seriously, but they knew a cheap thrill could make money.'When Worlds Collide' was an attempt to make a 'serious' sci-fi movie. Something to really make you think rather than offer just a cheap thrill. Watching it today, it is obvious that very little research had been done into the science end of the equation. The emphasis was on fiction. That's where the cheap thrills lay. Nevertheless, it should be remembered that this movie was released in 1951, 6 years before the first orbital vehicle - Russia's 'Sputnik 1'. So there was very little work to build from. Taken at face value, it has a great deal going for it. The director understands that STORY comes first. And this is presented in fine style with constant references to time and its brevity. The confused and fractured politics of cold-war paranoia are also nicely represented, with no clear notion about how to proceed, and the stimulus deriving only from private vision and funding. We are not distracted by tedious back-fill stories of the characters or needlessly maudlin dissertations (just check-out 'Deep Impact' as an object lesson on how not to do it). Acting is perfectly adequate, directing is tight, effects OK for their vintage. There's a splendid streamlined rocket after the 'Dan Dare' style. A movie entailing a collision with something from outer-space was way ahead of its time. The new planet looks suspiciously like an advertisement hoarding for the perfect holiday, but - hey; it's 1951. The rocket and its track were almost certainly the inspiration for Jerry Anderson's 'Fireball XL5'. Science fiction? About as good as it got at that time, in a movie industry where moguls didn't know a damn thing about science. The ship contained about 40 people; that's nowhere near enough to establish a breeding colony. Within a few generations they'd be as freaky as the hillbillies of 'Deliverance'. But the movie works because the story comes first. The director at least knew that much. Some 40 years later, movie makers need to go back to school.

However, the script is poor, from the very first moments when portentous Biblical quotes start us off, right the way to the same thing popping up at the end. The acting, from a cast who largely remained as obscure as they deserved, is lame. And the relatively sparse effects are less than brilliant, with the final painting of the New World being particularly poor (and with what looks suspiciously like a man-made structure at the far left perhaps that was a plot point set up for a sequel).And what was it with the lookalikes? The main actor, Richard Derr (who would surely have changed his name if he was working today, say it out loud) looks like Danny Kaye, and I think I spotted Robert Shaw and Stuart Whitman clones in there too. At least spotting doubles gave me something to do, because this film is much, much duller than it should be.John Hoyt, as the rich nasty piece of work, is dreadful to the point where he is painful to watch.George Pal, the poor man's Irwin Allen, did substantially better than this lacklustre offering.

Scientists discover two rogue stars, both in the path of destroying the Earth. The smaller one, dubbed Zyra, will pass our planet and cause massive destruction. The larger one, dubbed Bellus, will collide with Earth and blow it to bits. But in an attempt to ensure the continuity of our life on Earth, the scientist plan to build a ship, a modern Noah's Ark, to transport a selected few to Zyra which is able to sustain life.There are no big names in the cast, and some of the dramatics and special effects are a bit talky nowadays. But WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE is still an entertaining piece of old-fashioned sci-fi fun as Pal is able to flex the large scale of his production with some impressive sets, effects (the scenes of destruction are surprisingly well done) and an epic score by Leith Stevens.

The star probably would not have reached Earth for a hundred years, plenty of time to move to Mars. But still, for a film that came out six years before Sputnik, they do make some accurate points. Everyone blacks out during take-off and the ship is essentially what the space shuttle came to be. 1951, everyone thought it would be impossible to land on the moon.Second, the film does show what would probably happen at the end of the world (less that four years to 12/21/2012!). The general population ignores the correct people until it is too late. Everyone is moved inland for the end of the world. For a 1950s film, they can get away with all the religious allusions. Then, in the last hour, everyone left behind becomes what humans really are deep down savage, survivalist animals.There are some minor flaws, like the annoying announcer saying Only four days left! We're falling behind! Make it up! Hurry! Hurry! However, there is a nice touch when the rich guy gets out of his chair in a futile attempt to escape.Scientific problems aside, the film shows a good view at human nature and what we become at the end of the world.

The only thing I really noted about it is just how close it is to the recent film 2012. I imagine the new film was heavily influenced by this one, which will be quite embarrassing when the Stephen Sommers directed remake of When World's Collide is released next year. For some reason, another star with an Earth-like planet is fast approaching Earth and will eventually consume it. A group of scientists believes they might be able to fly to the other planet, called Zyra, when it passes by, and thus be safe. Even for 1951, the science is painfully stupid. The special effects, mostly miniatures, won an Oscar in 1952, but look horrible nowadays. Much like 2012, the film cares very little that billions of people are dying or about to die. Well, 2012 exploited it for Roman-style entertainment purposes. When Worlds Collide just forgets about it. There seems to be no real moral conundrum for most of the passengers getting on the rocket ship (all white, of course). Richard Derr has a passing guilt about it for a moment. He seems pretty glad that the doctor fixes it so the guy in the wheelchair doesn't get to come along (don't worry, wheelchair guy is an ass). Thank God they brought puppies for the cute little blonde boy, though. I wish they made a sequel where these people, set to start a new master race, had to find some place on this completely unknown planet to live.

The magic arrived when everyone involved would believe in the end product, ergo a good film. To make it more interesting, someone would include the magic words, science fiction. If the words weren't enough, then in would come the author. If they included Edwin Balmer, then nothing short of total incompetence could destroy the entire project. That is what happened in this film. The actors were good and included Richard Derr as David Randall, Barbara Rush plays Joyce Hendron, Peter Hansen played Dr. Tony Drake M.D. and John Hoyt was superb as Sydney Stanton the self-centered millionaire. The story is plausible enough, but then someone knocked over the cart carrying common sense and replaced it with absolute nonsense. With the world about to be destroyed, the earth's nations' prepares to gather a few humans and launch them into space and re-start humanity anew on a new planet. But watch carefully as the selected group consists of all Anglo Saxon people. You will notice there is no one of color selected to go on the ride. No African Americans, Indians, (Feather or Dot) Asians, Spanish, no people of any other color, except white. They all cram into a single rocket which by modern standards would never fly off the Earth much less make interplanetary travel. Furthermore, except for one child, no children are selected. Only one character, the millionaire is blatantly honest about his salvation. All in all this film was made long before reason and skin color became a factor in the selection of a final humanity.

It looked pretty good back then, and it translated well to TV/videotape.The basic idea a planet and a red dwarf are entering the Solar System. The Earth will be destroyed. Mankind's only chance is to build a spaceship (or ships) to migrate to the new planet. One is built, and people and animals, rather like Noah's Ark, are loaded aboard, and the ship takes off, to land on the new planet.(During a close pass of the planet, there was a scene of a tidal wave sweeping down the streets of New York City. However, if the viewer is at all familiar with the city, the wave is traveling North to South, whereas in reality it would be East to West. I break up every time I see that.)Spoilers Among Discussion There was discussion about the launch of the rocketship, using a ramp/catapult. If the rocket had a larger, lower stage, particularly if jet propelled, this might have made some sense. But as presented, there would have been major aerodynamic energy losses from drag given its trajectory; however, it looked dramatic. In the studio hype, this launch technique was mentioned, saying that there were discusions about the approach. But whatever was discussed wasn't shared with the public.An article of faith is that the new planet would actually take up an orbit around the Sun at a life-sustaining distance. More likely, if the other body and the Earth had sufficient mass to pull the other body enough to slow its orbital speed, its orbit would still be too eccentric for life to be sustained. Pity that a tad more detail on the orbits hadn't been added and discussed.Now to get technical the diorama of the new world looked phony because the camera was not positioned correctly for the shot. If the pivot point had been located at a lens nodal point, it would have looked fine. By setting the camera as it was, the panning showed that the world was a flat (two-dimensional) scene. Since this was the final shot, it made a really poor closing.All that aside, it was an entertaining film.

Sci-Fi doesn't get any more quintessentially fifties than this; with the obligatory narrated intro spoken by a stern and portentous voice (There are more stars in the heavens than there are human beings on Earth&#x85;), the inescapable doomsday scenario, macho male scientists and hysterically screaming dames in distress, delightfully spectacular special effects and dazzling spine-chilling dialogs. George Pal's production of the famous Edwin Balmer novel is a bona fide genre classic, with the masterful acting performances of a terrific ensemble cast and the surefooted direction of a more than experienced cinematographer. Delivery pilot Dave Randall is requested to transport a black suitcase, containing an astronomical report and its conclusions, from a South African observatory to the eminent New York astrologist Dr. Hendron. The calculations are sadly correct and in approximately eight months Earth will come into collision with the dying star Bellus and its orbiting planet Zyra. The impact will be all-devastating and every type of life on Earth shall become extinct. Whilst the majority of the world is in denial, Randall and Dr. Hendron begin with the construction of a spaceship &#x96; some sort of 20th Century Noah's Ark &#x96; to transport forty or so elite human beings to start a new society on planet Zyra after the collision. As doomsday rapidly approaches, the inevitable conflicts come to the surface. Who will go aboard the spaceship? Who's to decide which lives are more valuable than others? Another reviewer already pointed out that When Worlds Collide follows the traditional and most effective structure in cinema. First pay attention to the elaboration of a powerful story, subsequently provide more depth and background to the main characters (whether or not through using clichés, like the nearly fundamental triangular relationship) and then &#x96; and ONLY then &#x96; overwhelm the audience with special effects. Admittedly it sounds very simply, but it appears that only in the golden fifties filmmakers fully understood the importance of this narrative structure. Speaking of the special effects, several images in When Worlds Collide are legendary. A couple of weeks prior to the collision, Earth undergoes a series of natural disasters like volcanic eruptions, tsunamis and earthquakes. Several shots in the film, like a flooded New York with shipwrecks and tips of the skyscrapers sticking out or the Brazilian rain forest on fire, are still impressive to behold even after 60 years. The Academy Award for best special effects was definitely deserved, although I have no idea what the competition was. The only regret I have is that we don't get to see any images of the actual collision between Earth and Bellus. Regardless of how tacky and unreal they probably would have looked, I would have loved to see it! Instead, the film ends with cheesy and more or less disappointing cardboard images of the space travelers' new habitat. Minor flaw in an overall terrific Sci-Fi landmark. I'd also like to write a special honorable mention to veteran actor John Hoyt for his brilliant performance as the crippled but heavily obnoxious and cynical millionaire Sydney Stanton, who finances the construction of the rocket and insists on having decision right regarding who deserves a seat.

Why? For several reasons1.) The science and technical aspects covered are really way out there. Although some leeway must be given since the movie came out before actual rockets and space travel were possible.  Thus, most of the science and tech talk was conjecture.2.) The U.S. was the only country working on a rocket to put people in another planet?  No international community, I guess.  Asia, Europe, and the Soviet Union just didn't seem to exist.  Unlike the current climate of space travel and science.3.) The racial undertones of the movie.  Anyone notice that the 64 chosen people (along with a bunch of animals to breed for food and such) to embark on the journey to another planet were all WASPs (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant) ?  No African, Arab/Muslim, Asian, Hispanic, Catholic or Jewish people.  Plus, most of them were blond haired and/or blue-eyed.  Not very culturally diverse. Hitler would have loved this movie if he had lived.4.) The purpose of the journey and rocket was to continue the human race on another planet.  If so, several important considerations were avoideda.) Why 32 men and 32 women?  If the goal was to populate another planet as quickly as possible, why not just 6 men and 60 women?  That would allow 60+ new humans per year for like 20 years.  And then it grows exponentially. Plus, you would have to make sure that the men and women chosen weren't sterile.b.) If you are going to redo humankind another planet, why not give consideration to not have those with genetic flaws go?  That way, many genetic diseases or conditions could be avoided.  Although, that would smack again of the Nazi flair and movies like 1984 and Gattaca.5.) The stupid painting/mural used at the end to represent the landscape of the alien planet.

The modern version of this film is called Deep Impact and it is , in this case far better than its original for its special effects ( that's obvious ) but also for its character development. When worlds collide gets off to a good start but the latter half of the film lacks punch. Where was the so-called collision which had to occur ? We see nothing of it ! We see a limited number of people making off in a space craft to another planet with very unrealistic sets. The build-up during the film is good, the end falls flat. In Deep Impact, the build-up is very good, and the end is absolutely EXCELLENT. I also found picture quality a little fuzzy, nowhere near as good as that of The War of the Worlds which was an excellent film on all counts as well as having superb picture quality.

Really.I'm an amateur astronomer, so it's difficult for me to be fair to the science in Hollywood movies, but this one was more than usually inept. The characters kept referring to the body Bellus as a star, when it is quite obviously a planet. No attention is paid to realistic units of time or space. The wonderful spaceship on which a few dozen humans escape at the end has a gas gauge exactly like an automobile's! There is no attempt to determine whether the planet Zyra (to which these humans escape) has a breathable atmosphere, even though this could have been done quite easily from an enormous distance the humans simply decide to point their rocket at Zyra, land, and start breathing.I could forgive some of the science stuff if the main sub-plot had not been a horrible re-tread of the two men, one woman thing that Hollywood has thrown us in a hundred cheap guises.Finally, you will never see a better reminder of just how Caucasian America in the 50s was. There isn't a face in the seats of that spacecraft, nor in the much larger group who work on the spacecraft, that isn't white white white white white. At the end, as the very white survivors of the human race stare off into a colorful cartoon landscape and tacky angelic music plays, you might wish for another rogue planet to come along and target Zyra ... because it's quite obvious this brave new world has nothing in its future but Wal-Mart and strip malls.Perhaps the upcoming remake will correct the racial balance of the story.
