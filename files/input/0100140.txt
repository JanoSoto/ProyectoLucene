[{"Title":"A magic potion!","Date":"27 March 2001","Score":"42 out of 46 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  A delightful period piece set appropriately in 1963.  Appropriate because Charlotte (Wynona Ryder), like the nation, is about to shed a little of her innocence and face some difficult realities.  Cher, Ryder and an adorably young Christina Ricci are perfect as a single parent family.  Cher, in her best work ever, including Moonstruck, is a free-spirited mom who only cooks finger food because anything else is too much of a commitment.  Ryder, who narrates the film from her character's perspective, is a high school student who, despite her fervent wish to lead a devout life, falls in love with the local handyman.  Ricci is the youngest, a champion swimmer who steals the whole movie with scenes like her pumpkin scene. (Watch it and you'll know what I'm talking about.  It's unforgettable.) Bob Hoskins is hilarious as the shoe salesman who falls head over heels for Cher, family and all.Set in coastal Massachusetts, the scenery is breathtaking, and the idyllic depiction of life in a small town in the last days of American innocence is dead on.  Director Richard Benjamin, who also gave us such charming films as Milk Money and My Stepmother is an Alien, rivals Penny Marshall and Rob Reiner with this gem.This film is perfection, an absolute 10.  It's a magic potion that can make me laugh and feel good even on the worst day.  I sometimes wish I could step inside a la Pleasantville and stay there.

What stands out most about this film is the acting, and the overall feel of the film. It feels tremendously authentic to its time and subjects. The acting is very good throughout, and the movie is just a very fun, and very human story. One that is easy for almost anyone to relate to in some way.There are a number of great performances in this film. Winona Ryder plays one of her most interesting characters, and she pulls it off very well. Bob Hoskins is very strong and enjoyable as usual. Personally I have always loved Cher's acting. I can't say I'm a huge fan of her music, but I've always had some respect for her there too. However her acting has always been very strong in my opinion. I know she has been nominated for multiple Oscars and even won one for Moonstruck. However I still think her acting is somewhat underrated by most people. (And she also gave Nick Cage his first huge break after demanding that the studios cast Cage opposite her in Moonstruck. Cage was thought to be somewhat of a risky bet back in those days, and Cher basically made the major studios take the chance with him. Which I find somewhat funny, and also very Cher like.). Cher also had the original director of this film, and the girl who was originally cast in Winona's part fired. So Winona fans also have Cher to thank for her even being in this film. It's hard to criticize Cher for getting rid of these originals either, seeing as how well the film turned out with the people she approved. She is a very strong minded and hearted woman in my view, and if you take a look at Silkwood, Mask, Moonstruck, and this nice little film. You will undoubtedly also see that this woman can flat out act. She has some other decent films as well.Anyway, all in all, I highly recommend Mermaids to anyone that likes character driven film. And basically to any teen, male or female. It is basically a coming of age story in terms of Winona's character, and even for Cher and Hoskins characters to some degree too. ) And there is a lot to relate to in terms of the parent/child relationship, especially the single parent. Those with Attention Deficit Disorder , or those who get bored easy may not get into it however. ) I gave this film a 7, but I'm a pretty strict rater, and this film is a very solid 7 in my opinion. In fact, I'd give it a 7.5 if I could.7.5/10 "},{"Title":"**** Endlessly charming","Date":"17 February 2000","Score":"24 out of 28 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  I first saw this film as a preteen and have loved it ever since. Endlessly entertaining performances are the best thing about this underrated and understated coming-of-age comedy that features Cher doing what she does best--convincing you she rules the world, and she really does. As Rachel Flax, a headstrong and independent mother of two (Winona Ryder, Christina Ricci), she thinks nothing of jumping into her car at the slightest sign of trouble and moving to another town (Life is change, she says). Ryder is excellent as the fifteen year-old Charlotte, a girl who thinks that the best way to fight her burgeoning hormones is to devote her life to the Catholic church as a nun, despite the fact that she's Jewish. Of course, the boy next door (the sadly now retired Michael Schoeffling) gets in the way of her holy ambitions. Bob Hoskins is also a riot as the awshucks shoe salesman who falls over himself for Rachel, first out of fascination, and then out of love. Great music, great period feel and very light, warmhearted direction by Richard Benjamin.

That's mostly Richard Benjamin's doing, but the great cast got inspired -- maybe by the glowing fall colours, maybe by the nostalgic fashions of 1963 -- to really outdo themselves.Richard Benjamin's direction deserves extra credit because he was not filming his own autobiography, the way Fran√ßois Truffaut was in 1959. Similarities in the two storylines encompass more than just the awkwardness of adolescence. (Charlotte watches the Singing Nun on television, while Antoine lights a candle before a holy image of Balzac.)Cher is as good as she was earlier in Moonstruck, while Winona exceeds her performance in Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael. And they both prove they can be pretty in pink.Bob Hoskins and Cher have a genuine chemistry.

Mermaids tells the story of an upbeat mother named Rachel Flax (Cher) who after every failed relationship she moves to another state along with her two daughters Charlotte and Kate (Winona Ryder and Christina Ricci)and finally settles down in a small town in Massachusetts and finds herself in a relationship with a shoe-salesman named Lou Landsky (Bob Hoskins). However, she's fearful of commitment and the struggles to accept this man to be in relationship is a fear she must overcome. Meanwhile her oldest daughter Charlotte wants to become a nun (although she happens to be Jewish and not Catholic) is also smitten for an attractive older school bus driver Joseph Porretti (Michael Schoeffling). Her youngest daughter is obsessed with water and the ocean and has a future planned to peruse a career in the aquatics (she has already won several awards for her accomplishments).The characters are so rich and it should be thanked to the great performances by the cast who made it all possible. It seems that the performers were custom made to fit his and her respected roles, though several of the major stars were not the original choices for these parts. The director of the movie was Richard Benjamin who was hired after Lasse Hallstrom and Frank Oz were given the ax by the star Cher. For the part of Charlotte Flax, British thespian Emily Lloyd was slated but she was let go because they wanted a character that had some physical resemblance to Cher and so Ryder became her replacement (she was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress). To me it was a perfect match.Though she's been snickered and jabbed at by the media, but I think she's a very good performer and she has never once turned in a performance that made me want to put a bag over my face. Rachel Flax reminds me a lot of my own mother. She's light-spirited, spontaneous and just the right person to visit for a tuna sandwich and lemonade. A bit of a philanderer, but that soon changes once Lou wants to be in a committed relationship with her.The story caters through the eyes of the eldest daughter; Charlotte who seems obsessed with everything that is Catholic and at the same time cannot keep her mind off of Joseph. She does not want to end up inheriting any of her mother's unorthodox traits, while at time feels obligated to take up that task of second mother to her much younger sister Kate. Charlotte's trials and tribulations add the right touch of humour and pathos that flow by very immaculately as the film carries through.Based on a novel by Patty Dunn, Mermaids has an equally amount of laughter and choices the right time when serious issues come into fruition. The chemistry between Cher and Hoskins are just as equally engaging as the chemistry between Ryder and Schoeffling. The direction was simple and easy to follow and the feeling of the 1960's plays along very nice with a great soundtrack, this is a romantic comedy that isn't sappy or preachy, just a lot of fun and chuckles that will amuse you in the 150 minute duration.

Winona Ryder plays the eldest daughter who actually looks down her mother. Ryder dreams of becoming a nun so that she can live a pure and honest life. Cher is the mother, who constantly moves her family around whenever she fails at a relationship. Ryder is tested by a young man that she starts to have feelings for while Cher has difficulty adjusting to a serious relationship with Bob Hoskins. It's a fine film on all accounts as both a comedy and a romantic drama. The rift between Cher and Ryder is an easy one to understand and they both play it brilliantly. You always get the feeling that they are tired of one another, but the love is always present. Hoskins is a fantastic and surprising romantic lead. He gives off a strong dominant force, but also comes across as fragile. It's his strength that gradually repairs this family. Christina Ricci stars as the youngest daughter and it's no surprise she became a star. She manages to do young and cute without being annoying. The soundtrack helps to capture the time period very well. The pacing is often off and it feels like an edited down novel, but when it's hitting those high notes in terms of comedy or drama it is a great watch.

The period era is nicely evoked and there is a good selection of music from the era. And the closing sequence, with the Flax family preparing a meal (with Mrs Flax's typical selection of picnic finger foods - she's not a big fan of cooking) while singing and dancing along to the Shoop Shoop Song, is absolutely joyous.Recommended.

Rachel's promiscuity irks her daughter even further. In response Charlotte develops an infatuation with Catholicism, nuns and convents; she hopes to evade her mother's supposedly sinful life by becoming its pious opposite. By the film's end, both mother and daughter have learnt to accept each other, Rachel settling with a kindly man (Bob Hoskins), and Charlotte learning that happiness can exist outside conventionally perfect nuclear families.Terms of Endearment (1983) spawned a decade of imitative Hollywood comedy-dramas. Mermaids is one of the last. It's elevated by Cher and Ryder's movie-star charisma, the former with her concrete cheeks and diva sassiness, the latter with her pixie hair and adorable wisecracks. Elsewhere director Richard Benjamin carefully juggles schmaltz, truths and comedy, all held together by beautiful Massachusetts scenery. The film's title alludes to both Charlotte's sister (Christina Ricci), a swimming prodigy, and the film's three central characters, all transient, itinerant women who refuse to drown in the face of life's little tsunamis. 7.9/10 - See Anywhere But Here and Wendy and Lucy.

The film is directed by actor-turn-director hack Richard Benjamin and the overall reception is a sloppy sentimental piece of essay on woman's independence and religious ambivalence. The story goes smoothly with an occasionally witty, but otherwise run-of-the-mill narrative (the highlight for me is the ocean in the room time which effectually casts a genuine uplift upon me), Cher seems to steer onto a more restrained way of acting to manifest her modern new woman pioneer archetype, unwed mother with 2 children, casually flirting with men, sleeping with men and taking on a not-so-serious relationship with Bob Hoskins (a deliberate set with a jarring comparison). But this time, the film's saving grace is not from their adult cast (considering a considerately miscast Michael Schoeffling as the handsome but rather stiff love interest of Ryder), but two young starlets, Ryder and Ricci. Ryder has her own terms of endearment moments near the finale, a mutual emotional burst with Cher, and most of the time she is the leading role or at least the co-leads (ironically Golden Globe thought hers is a supporting role, a typical discrimination still prevailing now towards the young talents). Her incessant voice-over of a young girl's world inward is the driving force to propel the film and its audience into the (now) somewhat dated world-of-view in those days. Ricci is simply endearing as the young mermaid/swimmer sister, there is a soppy point one dreads her safety during the drowning accident, and labelled as a comedy-drama, the film dares not to risk dragging itself into a self-reprimand moral abyss which could sabotage all the generic concoctions it has achieved.

However, the film is not content to merely be a mother-daughter film, and so adds in two love stories to run simultaneously against the main theme. That's the film's main problem; it's over-ambitious for what it is. Although the romance's do add to the plot; they aren't developed enough, and therefore they don't quite feel right. Add that to a lackluster (and at times just simply awful) script, and the film falls apart like a straw bridge with an elephant sitting on it.As mentioned, the film charts the relationship between a mother and a daughter. The alienation between the two people is shown straight away by the way that the daughter refers to her mother as Mrs Flax. We later find out that the mother never faces up to her troubles and ups sticks and leaves every time something goes wrong; with an obvious detrimental effect on the daughter, who thinks that the way to handle problems is to run away. This film does the character relations well, but as I mentioned; the script is iffy to say the least. There are parts of the film where we get let into the secret of what Winona's character is thinking, and it comes off so ridiculously that it's almost farcical. And that does the movie no favours in the credibility department. Mermaids does, however, feature a good cast. Cher is surprisingly good for a singer-turned-actress, but her performance begins to show cracks later on in the film when she really has to act; although she always retains some believability. Winona Ryder has proved before and since this film that she can act, but her performance here isn't one of her best. That being said, she isn't bad; and the aforementioned lackluster script, of which Winona gets the rubbish end, can account for a lot of her bad acting; as she has to utter some truly terrible lines. In contrast to Cher, Winona's performance improves as the film goes on and the stormy scene between Cher and Winona towards the end is Winona's best (and Cher's worst). Aside from the two leads, the film also stars Christina Ricci, who despite being very young, impresses in her role and Bob Hoskins; who was the standout for me. His role didn't require any real acting ability, but he does a great job at inspiring sympathy. He's almost tragic, in a light hearted sort of way.Mermaids is far from being a masterpiece, but it is worthy of the title; 'good'. Everything in this movie has been done to a better effect somewhere else, but the film should be enjoyed for what it is; a quirky, and at times funny, coming of age tale. And one that is easy to forget.

Mermaids is best described as 'cute' or 'heartwarming' (i.e., it's not a laugh-out-loud farce nor is it an intimate character study, it is lost somewhere in between). Young girl coming-of-age in the early 1960s fantasizes about becoming a nun while her flighty, unmarried mother moves her and her sister from place to place. Reportedly troubled production does show its seams in the early scenes (which aren't thought-out clearly by anybody), but it does settle into a comfortable rut midway through. Tone is gentle except for Cher, who doesn't have a grip on Mrs. Flax is she flashy trash, sexy hostess or concerned working mom? Bob Hoskins is teddy bear-ish as Cher's new guy, although they seem a little mismatched and uncomfortable with each other. ** from **** "},{"Title":"Mermaids","Date":"28 July 2013","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" I recognised the title because of the two leading actresses and leading actor, but I was interested to know the origins of the title, and I knew it would feature the song that the singer/actress got to number one with, from director Richard Benjamin (The Money Pit, My Stepmother Is an Alien). Basically, set in 1963, fifteen year old Charlotte Flax (Golden Globe nominated Winona Ryder, who also narrates throughout) lives with her glamorous but eccentric mother Rachel who she refers as Mrs. Flax (Cher) and her little sister Kathryn 'Kate' (introducing nine year old Christina Ricci). The family are forced to constantly move when the mother's relationships or circumstances go wrong, they have now relocated to Eastport, Massachusetts to a small town near a convent, Charlotte is fascinated and idolises the nuns despite being reminded by Rachel that she is Jewish, while Kate loves swimming and ocean, she has won many swimming competitions. In the town, Charlotte has feelings for twenty six year old handsome convent caretaker and local school bus driver Joe Porretti (Michael Schoeffling), while Rachel has affection for local shop owner named Lou Landsky (Bob Hoskins), while remaining selfish, self obsessed and hopelessly promiscuous. Following the assassination President John F. Kennedy, Charlotte kisses Joe in the church bell tower, and being naive she wrongly assumes that she is pregnant, and she cannot talk to her mother about her fear, but later an obstetrician examining her confirms that she is still a virgin, she is relieved. At a New Year's Eve costume party Rachel dresses as a mermaid (hence the title), and Lou, dressed as a pirate, asks her to move in with him, but she refuses and they fight, and being driven home she is kissed by Joe, and watching them Charlotte thinks her promiscuous mother is trying to steal him. Later that night Charlotte takes the mermaid costume and goes with Kate to the convent with Joe, while the little sister collects rocks the older sister loses her virginity (for real), and distracted she does not realise Kate fell into the river and almost drowned, she was saved by nuns. Rachel is very angry and wants to move house to avoid embarrassment of her older daughter and Joe being talked about, but Charlotte fights her corner to avoid this, and the argument ends with the mother convinced to stay at least one year. In the end Rachel stays in the town where her relationship with Lou continues, Joe keeps in touch by postcard after moving away, Charlotte is studying her passion subject Greek myths, Kate has recovered with only some deafness, and for the first time in ages the family sit down at the table to dinner. Also starring Caroline McWilliams as Carrie, Jan Miner as Mother Superior, Betsy Townsend as Mary O'Brien, Richard McElvain as Mr. Crain and Paula Plum as Mrs. Crain. Cher is good as the oddball and out there mother, Hoskins does his accent okay and is likable, Ryder is a great surprise as the opinionated and confused girl, and Ricci is so adorable and cute with her sweet nature and attitude. The story is simple, a quirky family living the nomadic lifestyle, the love interest plots with the two women is interesting, the bickering and emotional arguments are engaging, the period of the film is convincing, and of course it is great to hear The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss) (both the Betty Everett and the number one version by Cher), it is a nice gentle, funny and light-hearted romantic comedy. Very good!

One day I was bored and scrambled through my video collection and found Mermaids. This movie has nothing to do with _real_ mermaids but it is very pleasant. Cher plays a Jewish mother of two girls (both from different dads, both whose dad's abandoned them). Everytime she encounters a problem she moves. One day again she encounters problems and moves to a little town (I think it was in Massachusetts but I won't mislead you because I'm not sure). Her eldest daughter (played by Winona Ryder) Charlotte, a teenager who is not exactly the world's best Jew- she's a Catholic in her own spirit who wants to become a nun. The younger daughter (played by an extremely young Christina Ricci) had definite swimming talent. But things change in this new town they have moved to- Mrs. Flax (Cher) allows her self to fall in love with Lou (Bob Hoskins). And even Charlotte's hormones kick in as she falls in love with a Catholic man, Joe who is older than her. A cute little movie about a cute little family in a cute little town.

This movie takes us into the intimate world of an oldest daughter's coming of age in a transient single-parent family. We haven't all experienced this. If we have, this story would be pointless. The point is the differing experience, there is no value in merely reflecting viewers' own realities.As for me, the drawing card was Winona Ryder. The surprise is the supporting cast a very young Christine Ricci, wild Cher, horny Bob Hoskins, all make a wonderful compliment to Winona's portrayal of a young woman in the early American sixties.The movie title is deceptive. I suspect the book would be a little clearer in explaining the meaning. It is Cher who dresses up as a mermaid, yet the characters of Winona and Christine who may be the mermaids.

Although the setting is a small town in the early sixties, Rachel is definitely a woman before her time. She is happier without any longterm commitments and moves the family around on the spur of the moment. Charlotte (Winona Ryder) is mortified by her mother in every way. She prefers to think of the pure and sacrificing lives of nuns, the exact opposite of her mother. When she meets a nice young man in the new city, she dreams of him even as she is committed to chastity. Alas. Sometimes, things do not go as planned and Charlotte finds herself in a position where her scruples are severely tested. Also, she unwittingly puts her younger sister in great peril by her actions. What does the future hold for these three intriguing females? This movie is a charming and sweet look at the rough nature of adolescence. Ryder has never been better and Cher also makes a striking impression as the carefree mother. The script is funny and poignant and the costumes quite wonderful. Bob Hoskins also lends his great skills as a friend of the family. Do you want to go back and relive a bit of your life vicariously and then feel content that you've been there and felt that?

Cher delivers one of the best performances of her career as the off-the-wall Rachel Flax, an independent, way-ahead-of-her-time, aging party girl who sometimes puts her own good time ahead of the welfare of her daughters. Winona Ryder is appealing as Rachel's elder daughter, Charlotte, who is so embarrassed by her mother that she refers to her in her off-screen narration as Mrs. Flax and Christina Ricci already begins to show the gifted actress she would turn into as Charlotte's little sister Katie. Bob Hoskins is also solid, as always, as the man who is smitten with Rachel but she keeps trying to keep at arm's length. Director Richard Benjamin really hits a bullseye here...recreating a turbulent period in history by contrasting it with a central character who seems to be oblivious of all that is going on except for in her own little world and backing the whole story with some wonderful music from the 1960's and Cher's cover of The Shoop Shoop Song during the closing credits is the bomb. An absolute delight from start to finish. Don't miss it.

She's always been, without a doubt, a great actress, and a very selective one, if you take a look. Consider her role in Mermaids; her character shows flashes of wildness. I want to add; maybe we should have expected what happened with her in real life, but you've got to give me that she was 19 and at the acting level of Oscar winner Cher.It's the most thrilling experience to watch Winona in any role at any time, because as I've said, her performances are always screaming Oscar to me. As she narrates the story here, you feel the character immediately; and you sense a human being. Subtly, Ryder expresses Charlotte's every minute feeling with a rough and soft voice that transmits I'm going to make a real sandwich, she says while she waits Joe (Michael Schoeffling) to pick her up.The film's main character Rachel Flax (Cher), Charlotte's mother, is one of those unique women that actually exist in real life. One of those women who have two daughters from different men and that carry her last name because both of the fathers are men she never saw again; one of those women who takes her daughters and luggage to everywhere and never stays in the same place for more than a year.As selfish as Rachel is (without knowing it), with a teenage daughter and a little daughter (Christina Ricci, probably the cutest thing in the film), she can't really handle it, we sense; because Charlotte won't talk to her and Kate (the Ricci character) isn't much around. Then a manly figure appears in the picture. A teacher called Lou, a nosy town man who finds himself amazed with Rachel, her girls and their situation; and tries to be a helping hand.Lou is played by the always reliable Bob Hoskins with such certainty that we fear him when he makes a threat that isn't really a threat. He is placed as the parental icon in the plot, and he does many things (some right and some wrong) for the good of these girls. Based on a novel by Patty Dan, June Roberts wrote the movie. She focused a lot on Charlotte's issues and faced them with Rachel's, generating a lot of impact in Ryder's character.It's something to analyze, but not now, that Winona Ryder won the National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actress and was nominated for the Golden Globes in 1991, but strangely couldn't make it to the Oscar. That's underestimation; and I'm not lying when I talk about Winona, she's really something.The picture's best scene comes from Cher and Ryder, in a fight they have. It's very well handled by the calm director Richard Benjamin, showing shots of both actresses talking. Ryder is so convincing that you want to cry with her, so is Cher. The fight finishes with both of them in the sofa. The title of the film means a lot inside the characters (you'll see), but it's represented in it when Kate wants an ocean in her bedroom (which Lou creates), because she swims.She says she would like to live in an ocean, like the mermaids, you know? Constantly swimming in the deep&#133;And that's something we all want during a certain time of our lives.

When there is any kind of disagreement, it is always about her. The children are just incidental. When she has a relationship go bad, her solution is to pick up and move to another town. Since the girls knew nothing else, they just accepted it as part of their existence. Until now, when Charlotte wants to finish high school and establish some connection to a community.

She talks to herself and is always worried that she might be punished for having impure thoughts. She develops an infatuation with Joe (Michael Schoeffling, 29) who is driving her school bus. During a moment of grief after hearing of the president's death, she kisses Joe, their lips lock, she is worried that she might be pregnant, goes to a doctor as 'Joan Arc' to see if she is pregnant, even though she is actually a virgin. Lou brings some sense of order into the lives of the Flaxes. They actually begin to sit at a table and have occasional meals together. They actually begin to have conversations.

She was ready to go to the parties discharging the function of taking care of the younger daughter to the elder one (Winona Ryder) and without taking into consideration that the latter was becoming a teenager with desires to have a boy-friend. So anything nearly tragic happening in this film is due mainly to the irresponsible behavior of Mrs. Flax. From this point of view this Drama is good to be seen by the parents, sons and daughters, all may have a lot to learn. Very good acting of Cher, Winona Ryder,Bob Hoskins and the rest of the cast.

Charlotte (Winona Ryder) and Kate (Christina Ricci), who are about 15- and 8-years old respectively, are her daughters. Cher's behavior and appearance is an embarrassment to Charlotte who is trying to think pure thoughts on her way to becoming a nun. Ironically (considering Ryder's recent troubles) the part she plays has no interest in new clothes and even refuses new shoes, content with her old square boots that look like they were made in the former Soviet Union during the reign of Stalin. This is a nice (but increasingly familiar) switch on the mother who is embarrassed by her daughter's precocious sexuality, and Cher and Ryder play their parts well.The story, from a novel by Patty Dann, begins with the trio moving into yet another town, this time somewhere in New England. They are always on the run, so to speak, because Cher is afraid of commitment or of staying around long enough to lose her heart to some guy. Enter predictably a man (Bob Hoskins) with the right stuff to win her over and a cute guy (Michael Schoeffing) to rearrange Charlotte's priorities. Director Richard Benjamin plays it as a romantic comedy cum coming of ager with wit and charm. Ryder is adorably cute as a conservative Christian miss goody two shoes who is always lecturing mom while Cher is voluptuous as the kind of woman who says yes, early and often, but underneath it all has strength and a kind of intuitive wisdom about herself and the people around her. Little Ricci really is the mermaid since she likes to practice holding her breath under water.Part of the strength of the film is in the dialogue and the sharp repartee between Ryder and Cher. My favorite line is from Charlotte who is always dialoging with God. After seeing Schoeffing, who drives the school bus, and realizing what she is feeling, prays Oh please God, don't make me fall in love and want to do disgusting things!(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

Mermaids is quite a good movie with some good music. (Including The Shoop Shoop Song (It's In His Kiss).)  Well, Mermaids is definitely different to many of the other early 90's comedies and I'm sure it will be enjoyed by most people.

Winona Ryder is fantastic as Charlotte a girl who is having difficulty with her own sexual awakening, and Michael Schoeffling is great as Joe the man who Charlotte desires. Its only a little film, but for people who have a soft spot for romantic comedies they will probably like this. Its also interesting to see Christina Ricci, in one of her first performances.

I was like, Whoa, hey! Watch it, there, shorty....  Of course I think Cher is beautiful, and is such a talent in this coming-of-age movie. The coming-of-ageness is done partly by Cher's character Rachel, and partly by Ryder's char, Charlotte.  I thought the screenplay/dialogue was ingenious. I also agree that, even though, in movies, subplots feel the need to force you into believing that it actually does take place in the 60's, this flick lightheartedly makes reference to it. The JFK thing was obvious, but that's only because he was a very big deal, especially back then in little towns such as the one they had moved to.   Mermaids doesn't try to politically correct any ism, but just acts as an omniscient character delving into the lives of a cute Jewish family. Maybe that's why you really feel like you're in the 60's watching it.-Sep  "}{"Title":"Cheery","Date":"17 July 1999","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  This movie is set in the 1960's, so everything is pretty old fashioned and friendly.  Mermaid's is a really cheery comedy about young Charlotte Flax (Winona Ryder), who was growing up and her interested change every now and then, which is normal for most teenage girls.  I thought this movie was good, even though through the naked eye, it looks boring.  "},{"Title":"The Last Film","Date":"23 June 2009","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" I walked into the cinema expecting this to be a film. I was right, but I thought it was going to be about women with tails swimming about the ocean, perhaps a sequel to The Little Mermaid. I was wrong. This is a film about a woman and her two daughters riding from town to town trying to get a break. Who cares. Who writes these things? Who watches these things? Seriously. Do you want to watch a film about a mummy shouting at her daughters and flirting with Bob Hopkins? No. Then they burst into a rendition of the Cheep Cheep song written by Dusky Springfield. It wasn't long before I fell asleep and dreamed a dream.I dreamt that I was a mermaid, or in this case a merman like in He-Man. I had a big 3-pronged fork which I used to catch my dinner- giant shrimp, octopussies, sea burgers etc. I wasn't the King or anything, but I was pretty well off as far as ocean dwellers go. I had a few concubines who would answer my every sordid whim. The main one looked like Winorda Rider so the film had some impact on me. One day I was relaxing on the ocean floor when a little lost boy swam round the rock shouting 'Kali Ma! Kali Maaa!' This disturbed me greatly so I gathered a group of my mates and went off to investigate. The source of the trouble was a giant dragon which had erupted from the ocean floor. We started to beat it with sticks and throw crabs at it but it laughed and turned into Les from Coronation Street. I was quite taken by surprise, and even more so when I looked down and saw that I was no longer a merman but a cup of tea sitting on a table on the set of Britain's most beloved soap. Vera had a suck of me, then Rita, then the ginger one, and Les dipped a digestive in me. Even now I feel his crumbs floating around my insides. All of a sudden Chair came running in singing the Woop Woop song, her and Bob Hostile dancing together, faster and faster. The youngest daughter from Mermaids (Lionel Ricci) came bounding in, tripped and banged into me. I tipped over the edge of the table and fell towards the carpet. Just before I hit the ground I woke up. The cinema was empty and the screen was blank. I realised I had slept over so decided to get up and go home for some sausages and whiskey.I noticed my watch (a Timex) had stopped. I walked out and found that no-one was around so I thought they were all in other screens, watching better movies. My footsteps seemed louder than usual, and there was an eerie quiet. An empty bag of minstrels rustled on the floor. Eager to put the whole episode behind me I made my way down the stairs and out they door. What greeted me I can only describe as silent carnage. Cars lay upturned on the streets, bikes and clothes lay strewn in the highest branches of the trees and on top of the lamp posts. Fires were burning all around, but in their dying stages. There was no wind. No sound. Everything seemed stale and artificial like a reality TV show commissioned by Channel 4. I had a feeling in my groin like some unknown force from centuries ago had taken residence there with no intention of leaving. The air had no taste but seemed like Polystyrene. Worse, there were no people. Shell shocked I stumbled across the street, still looking left and right for traffic even though the nearest car sat half in half out of the third storey of an office block behind me. I entered the corner shop looking for some fellow humans; not were to be found. Wait! Maybe some took shelter in the pub next door from whatever had happened here. What had happened? Terrorist? Aliens? Bomb? Earthquake? Act of God? I couldn't be sure, and my thoughts were not following logically anyway. Words bounced spontaneously about my head. Like. Unfocused. Wasps. Chasing. Jigsaw. Lullaby of descent into something something hell don't can't know no this isn't me here, why, why not whine aught? The pub was no less empty than the shop before. No-one anywhere. This was 4 days ago. I am home. I am alone. It's getting dark and I mostly get scared at night. Mostly. I haven't met another living soul in days. TV and radio are gone. Is there anybody out there? Let me know. I'll be at the town hall at midday everyday for an hour. I won't stay around for long though. I'm taking my bike down south to see if every town is the same. Head for the coast. Get a boat or swim if I must. Leave this place and find another way. Surely this can't be the only place. Please God.Best Bit Taking all the DVDs from HMV now that everyone's gone.

I give this dishonest film a 2 instead of a 1 because of the brilliant performance of Winona Ryder (at 18, how was it possible for her to escape the banal direction of Richard Benjamin?). But Ms. Ryder aside, the film has some notorious performances and character creation in it; Christina Ricci, trying her best, has created a loathsomely cute character. When this character falls into the frigid waters of a small pond I was praying that there would be a final shot of her breathing bubbles stopping what an insufferable little brat! Cher's entire persona and character made me think of what some critic said of a Katherina Hepburn Broadway performance she runs the gamut of emotions from A to B! The Mask of Cher, possibly o.k. to see once in a career, had become institutionalized by 1990 and I found myself having to look elsewhere on the screen when she appeared (in this case not much of a hardship given Winona Ryder's nuanced portrayal). Director Benjamin also should be given another dubious award. For the first and only time in my experiencing Bob Hoskins career, he is made to look foolish and bad.In closing I must mention that I have never in the past, as far as I can remember, mentioned another reviewer's comment; we can't and don't, as people, have the same reactions to things, but in the case of someone who commented earlier on this site, who mentioned Truffault's 400 Blows in the same breath as the atrocity Mermaids, I must set a precedent. The 400 Blows is one of the most honest films about a youngster I have ever seen. Mermaids is among the most dishonest one I have seen in many years. Compare Truffault and Benjamin favorably? My mind boggles and shudders simultaneously!

Barring neurological dysfunction, your daydreams will be more interesting.This movie is like a well-intentioned friend that is perpetually concerned with pleasing everyone and inevitably ends up pissing everyone off. It tries to be funny, insightful, artistic, removed and searching all at the same time and FAILS miserably at them all.Except for Michael Schoeffling, whose character would have been showed to better advantage using a scarecrow with his hands shoved in his pockets and his tongue shoved down anyone's throat (I'm glad he had the good sense to give up acting), most of the acting was decent. At the climax of the film, Winona Ryder was even impressive. The cinematography was fine, just not memorable. It's the script that kills them all. Not just a syringe of morphine killing either - this is a lying by the edge of the road in a million pieces killing. It's ridiculous without being funny (even ironically) and slow-moving without being insightful or inspiring. Even more unforgivably, it makes too-abundant use of tried and TIRED plot elements and twists.The only good thing about this movie was that the frustrating prospect of being stuck watching it while on my treadmill made me angry enough to run at full speed the whole time. Rent it and give it to your worst enemy while simpering Oh I know you'll LOVE this! "}]
