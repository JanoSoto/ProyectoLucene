In fact, his car dies, along with his cell phone and watch. He knocks on a nearby house to call for help, and the man who answers the door attacks him, saying Klein's been around three days in a row. But has he?Two years earlier, John's wife died from injuries sustained in a car wreck, and before she died, in an apparent delirium, she had been etching weird drawings. Could her drawings have some connection with this town?Based on true events, The Mothman Prophecies follows John through his search for the truth. People in the town report seeing a strange being - are they lying, or are they misinterpreting? Are they simply seeing UFOs, or is there more to the story? Intrepid reporter that he is, John wants to know more - although of course his thirst for knowledge is accompanied by a need to know what happened to his wife (why did the car crash?).Thrillers such as this one are hard to come by. It's not exactly a horror movie, but there are more than enough creepy moments to send a few chills reverberating through your body. It's a film that relies less on special effects than on such quaint ideals as character motivation and development and atmosphere. In fact, this movie's just brimming with atmosphere. We've all seen those cheesy movies in which a car runs out of gas along a desolate country road, and then BAM - some serial killers make dinner or belts out of the hapless occupants. But in this case, the monster is hardly ever seen, thereby heightening the scares.At the centerpiece is Gere as Klein. I've never, ever been a Gere fan; it seems to me he has one expression. He's never been terribly emotive and has been known in recent years more for the age disparity with his female costars than for anything else (they get younger, he stays the same old dude). Call him ruggedly handsome if you will, but vacuity is never really appealing.But this is not your typical Gere at all. He definitely turns in the best work of his career. Sure, he was appealing in Pretty Woman, but it was Julie Roberts' movie. Officer and a Gentleman? Ok, but that was Lou Gosset Jr.'s movie. Primal Fear? Red Corner? Runaway Bride? No, no, no. This is acting on a ledge for Gere. It's a true departure from the romantic comedies and the sly psuedo-mystery/dramas. Ordinarily, I would think such a movie would expose Gere for the terrible actor he is. But I would be wrong. This movie was so well written and directed that Gere rose to its level, rather than sinking it. That's a huge credit to him as an actor.Now, I need to differentiate between good acting and appeal. An actor can look good or be charming in a role and still be a bad actor; by contrast, an actor can look uncharming and turn in a great performance. But what's key is how the actor draws the audience in - do they sympathize with his plight? Are they on his side? How good of an actor he is will answer that question.Gere's Klein starts out as an average joe, and then we get to see him slowly descend into madness - we even descend a little with him. That vaunted atmosphere is so vibrant and realistic that we turn when he turns and feel things he feels. This is an absolute hallmark of excellent filmmaking (by Mark Pellington, whose only other big film was 1999's Arlington Road). The writing is crisp and eminently believable, and the acting in addition to Gere (including Laura Linney, Debra Messing, and Will Patton) is simply superb. And don't forget the prophecies part of the title, either; this Mothman entity issues warnings to whomever it deems worthy. Which sounds good, as long as one can interpret them correctly. Apparently, many have not.The story is based on actual events that took place in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, but this is no Amityville Horror story. With Amityville, one could distance oneself from the experiences of the family involved; we could say that it would never happen to us, it was only a movie. This is a little trickier with The Mothman Prophecies. It's a creepy, tingly movie that gets under your skin and crawls all over your heart.  "},{"Title":"Bad things just happen. We usually can't stop them.","Date":"22 February 2006","Score":"67 out of 76 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Mystery","Review":" The Mothman Prophecies is a solid thriller. It's supposedly based on true events, but even if it weren't, it would be worth a look. Richard Gere stars as a Washington Post reporter who inexplicably finds himself in a small West Virginia town where a series of strange goings-on have been happening. His wife was killed two years prior in a mysterious car accident, and there seems to be a connection between her death and the strange happenings in Point Pleasant. Holding the key behind the mystery seems to be a large moth-like creature who tends to show up in places where the loss of human life is about to occur. Gere meets up with several locals who claim to have seen the Mothman, and after a while this creature begins communicating with him. The creature warns people of tragedies about to strike (plane crashes, earthquakes), and Gere thinks this creature can even put him in contact with his dead wife. Gere is given a warning about an upcoming tragedy near Point Pleasant, but can he act in time to stop it? Or should he even try? The film is very moody and sullen. The direction and photography are top drawer, and they enhance the mood greatly. The acting is terrific, as well. I usually can't stand Gere, but he's great in this film. Laura Linney would seem miscast as a local cop, but by the end of the film, she will have proved how truly talented she is. Will Patton is outstanding as a local resident who has several run-ins with the Mothman until it drives him crazy.What exactly is the Mothman? According to this film, he's some type of oracle. He can see bad things that will happen, and he can even see through to the other side. Does he cause these tragedies? The film would seem to argue not. Though he may have caused the fatal car accident that took Gere's wife early on. Apparently the concept of the Mothman has been around for a while, but this film gives a pretty good explanation of it for those of us who had never heard of it before.The film came up short of its $40 million budget in theaters. I blame this on a terrible marketing campaign, and some bad reviews from the big name critics. Don't let their reviews scare you away. This film is very good. I was hooked after seeing only a couple minutes of it. It was the very effective scene where Gere and Patton first meet up at his home one evening. That was well done! Be warned, however. The film will likely leave you feeling very mortal, and maybe even depressed. There is a really cool new-age rock song during the credits that also adds to the mood.Consider this film a thinking man's Final Destination. The climactic scene at the end could have even wandered in from one of those movies. The Mothman Prophecies is worth about 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.

NOW!Simply put, The Mothman Prophecies is the scariest horror movie since RING, Since many Americans won't be able to see RING for quite some time, they should consider tasting another slice of the terror pie with Mothman. It's already a strong candidate for best horror film of 2002...and even as a hardcore genre fan, I'd have to put it on my list of favorite horror movies of all time.I had been fascinated by the Mothman myth since 1995, when I first read of its existence in a book of legends and folklore. Since then, I've often thought about making a horror film based on the story. And as you might guess, some one clearly beat me to the punch! The film takes some bizarre, allegedly true events that occurred in the mid-60s in Point Pleasant, West Viriginia and updates the strange phenomena to present day using a somewhat fictionalized story.Richard Gere plays John Klein (a character that I assume is based on real life author John Keel), a Washington Post reporter whose wife dies of a brain tumor shortly after a bizarre, seemingly unexplainable car accident. After she dies, he finds pictures she drew during her final days, pictures of a bizarre looking winged creature with glowing red eyes.Flash forward two years. Klein is on his way to meet the governor of Virginia, when his car breaks down. He goes to get help (I won't reveal the creepy details of this sequence) and learns that he is nowhere near his destination. Rather, in the space of 90 minutes he has somehow managed to travel 400 miles to Point Pleasant, West Virginia. There he encounters Sgt. Connie Parker (played by Laura Linney), who tells him of the many strange going ons in the town...specifically, the accounts of a bizarre creature from witnesses who are by all accounts reputable. She shows him a sketch that one witness drew of the creature, and it is nearly identical to the bizarre drawings Klein's wife had done before her death.You can probably guess where the film is headed from this point; in fact, that's part of the beauty. Astute viewers will always be one step ahead of the characters onscreen, and one step behind...The Mothman, or just director Mark Pellington. Each is pretty damn good at scaring people.Pellington his his second feature, Arlington Road, a top notch thriller along the lines of Rosemary's Baby. Here he goes for a more Twilight Zone approach, with the did it really happen? factor of films like The Amityville Horror, Snuff, and Cannibal Holocaust thrown in for very, very good measure. Pellington has been gaining quite a bit of critical attention for this film, and rightfully so. If he keeps up, one can see Mark Pellington, Victor Salva, and Alejandro Amenbar doing for the horror/thriller genre what John Carpenter, Wes Craven, and Dario Argento did for it in the 70s.Some critics have been apt to attack the film for its reliance on classic horror movie conventions...as if this is a bad thing. It's quite ironic, considering that it is the film's good old fashioned sensibility that makes the proceedings so overwhelmingly effective. It does not rely on cheap scares, post-PC gore, or loud sound effects to jolt its audience. The film's power is rooted in its fundamentally chilling story, and taken to another level thanks to Pellington's assured direction. He never condescends to the audience, and he never goes for anything less than the extreme. He knows how to push audiences to the edge of their seat...and fortunately for horror fans, he does not know when to stop. Hitch would certainly be proud.Yet the best element of The Mothman Prophecies is that, like the films of Hitchock, it is intended for its audience, and continues to engage them long after rolling the end credits. The film has a wonderfully self-reflective structure, and a haunting ending (Owen Gleiberman's comparison of this film to Nicholas Roeg's Don't Look Now is much deserved). However, many questions are left unanswered. Many plot threads still hang. Like Bob Clark's unnerving Black Christmas, The Mothman Prophecies does not provide the closure that most mainstream audiences would demand. The audience is forced to think about the film, and what it means, long after it's over. Mark Pellington insures that the Mothman's glowing red eyes will indeed stay fixed in our brains alongside the film's other haunting imagery. So remember, grown ups and young people alike....sleep with the light on.My Grade A "},{"Title":"History Revised","Date":"25 May 2005","Score":"89 out of 128 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Mystery","Review":" In 1966-67 a series of weird, supposedly supernatural, events occurred in or near Point Pleasant, West Virginia. Much of what happened centered on local residents' purported encounters with UFOs; confrontations with men-in-black; phone calls from entities whose voices sounded electronic (or metallic); and sightings of a winged, semi-human creature that came to be known as mothman. A few locals also were made privy to future predictions (prophecies), some of which in fact did materialize, but others didn't. One of the alleged predictions was a December, 1967 disaster that did occur, and which this film dramatizes.Available literature suggests a high probability that some, though by no means all, of the Point Pleasant events were the resulting activities of a practical joker, a prankster, by the name of Barker (who died in the 1980s). Other events appear to have been too bizarre and too widespread to be attributed to a lone carnival barker (pun intended).The Mothman Prophecies is not a very good factual account of the Point Pleasant events. Indeed, the film's setting is the present, not the 1960s, a fact which the film slyly evades. The filmmakers evidently decided to use part of the historical record, and then dramatize it, in a way that would have cinematic appeal to today's audiences.And so, the film aims to be a supernatural thriller, a suspenseful study in the theme of what is real vs. what is not real. There's lots of dark atmosphere with offbeat, gyrating camera shots, ominous music, and dialogue to match. The overall effect is one wherein unseen forces are lurking in the shadows.For some viewers, this supernatural tone thus provides intense escapist entertainment. For me, the hocus-pocus factor was too high, and the film exuded a sense of forced melodrama. Further, the film did not lead to any satisfactory resolution. What it did lead to was a nicely staged reenactment of the real life December, 1967 disaster.Maybe someday someone will make a documentary about the men-in-black element of the Point Pleasant events. If the underlying research is honest and thorough, the resulting film could illuminate a 1960s drama that, while not supernatural in nature, had, and still has, implications that are as scary as they are real.

Keel's famous UFO story.","Date":"22 August 2002","Score":"66 out of 86 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Mystery","Review":" (**** out of *****)What a wonderful and rich role for Gere who should maybe experiment more in movies that deal with the realms of the unknown.A much respected reporter for the Washington Post John Klein (Richard Gere) is about to have his life turned upside down when his wife dies in an automobile accident that seems to have been caused by a mysterious flying creature which he never did see himself. The plot takes Gere to the Ohio/West Virginia border where he meets with the local residents who all seem to be having their troubles with strange lights, weird phone calls and a bird like creature which they call the Mothman. Klein investigates the mystery at the cost of his own sanity and career.The film is very scary but lacks the pace and fibre that made the John A. Keel's book an awe inspiring read. There are no Men In Black, UFO's, alien impregnated women, phone tapings or a clear resolution to some of the character's fate. In fact only about 10% of the book is actually reproduced in the film. The other 90% seems to have been plucked from an episode of the `X-files'... but what a good episode it is! This is a film that has high production values. The lighting, camerawork, sound and editing are always on top form which is something that prevents the movie from disappearing into the ranks of science fiction B movie hokum. `The Mothman Prophecies' looks simply `weirdly' gorgeous on the big screen.There is not enough Mothman revealed to the viewer but country folk Gordon Smallwood (the well cast and superbly acted Will Patton) creates a much needed conduit into the effects that the Mothman has on the people of Point Pleasant and this is what the film is really all about - The consequences that the supernatural can have on the psyche of a small backward town's population. Although the ending is Mothman free it certainly does jolt the emotions and evokes a sort of belittling sympathy for the human beings of this planet.Watch this film and then go read the book for a much better look at really went on. All in all, the film is a spine-chilling riveting stuff and well worth repeated viewing even though it never truly escapes its `X-Files' feeling.

The atmosphere is solidly dark and mysterious, with a number of truly spooky sequences - particularly Gere's phone call from the Mothman. And despite the fact that everything is not explained to us up front, after all who could place logic to this strange true story, the film is a pretty decent gripper.

Based on a myth last discussed in great detail in the 60s, this is a modernised version of the legend of the Mothman, a mysterious figure who comes to people to foretell disastrous events. There is an air of Saturday night channel 5 about this film, but don't let that discourage you as its in the upper echelons of b-movie fair. Richard Gere is surprisingly entertaining as someone who essentially doesn't say much and just gets creeped-out.  A lot.  His character isn't that challenging for any actor, so there won't be any Oscar gongs headed his way for this. Laura Linney is excellent as the town sheriff, like someone straight out of Twin Peeks. The other characters are pretty much just there to move the plot along, rather than to catch your interest. The first half hour or so is entertainingly tense, but then the film lulls for the plot in the middle. The ending is satisfyingly and beautifully tidy, with a wonderful action sequence that clears up the vast majority of the weirdness from earlier on. The tight ending, while pleasurable and final is also one of the reasons that the movie isn't better than it is. There is no sensation upon leaving of question or edge. No concerns about turning the next corner for fear of what might be there. This is perhaps why this movie feels like Channel 5, and perhaps why its a 12 not a 15. Essentially its a creepy movie and not an out and out horror.

John and Mary Klein are a happy couple who have just purchased a new house. The excitement over their new place is short-lived when they have a car accident following the purchase. Mary winds up in the hospital with a head injury, but the CT scans reveal that she has something far worse wrong with her. She eventually dies, leaving a devastated John to discover that she had been drawing sketches of moth-like figures during her time at the hospital. A year passes, and John is scheduled to do an interview for his Washington Post job. On his drive to the interview, he mysteriously winds up in Point Pleasant, West Virginia with no recollection of how he got so far out of his way. Mysterious events are plaguing this small town, events that may be connected to what happened to his wife.I first saw this way back on opening night and loved it. As someone who is really into the unexplained, myths and legends, this film is right up my alley. The story of the Mothman is one of the most fascinating I've ever come across, and while The Mothman Prophecies takes a great deal of liberty with the story, it's a terrific film all the same.I've never cared for Richard Gere, but I fully admit that he's very good here. He nails the confused, distraught mental state of John Klein, and is very believable in the role. Laura Linney is also solid, though that's no surprise. The standout, though, is Will Patton. One of my favorite character actors, his portrayal of the rugged Gordon Smallwood, an individual who seems to have a deep connection to the Mothman, is absolutely perfect. This guy rarely fails to impress the hell out of me. He just has an awesome screen presence.The abnormal occurrences throughout the film certainly produce an unsettling atmosphere. Coupled with eerie imagery and surreal filming techniques, they help the film become quite nightmarish. The use of sound is most effective as well, with all sorts of bizarre noises being heard, including the odd screeching noise that the Mothman was said to have made in some of the real accounts. We also get a moody score that's a perfect fit for the film. Just listening to the soundtrack is guaranteed to give you chills. I know from experience. Speaking of chills, one of my favorite scenes is when Klein speaks with the Mothman entity, having dubbed itself Indrid Cold, on his motel room's phone. It's a wonderfully tense scene, and Cold's voice gets under your skin.The effects of the occurrences on the small town of Point Pleasant are well explored, as many different aspects and accounts are introduced. The town itself comes off as a bleak and unnerving place. Almost lifeless. The occurrences have basically killed off the town's livelihood. Gere's John Klein becomes increasingly paranoid the longer he stays in Point Pleasant, and when his dead wife appears to the sheriff, he becomes increasingly tortured. It isn't long before he's driven to a distant and isolated state of being, much like Gordon before him.The climactic scenes do not disappoint either. The scene where Klein realizes what is really going to happen makes for a powerful moment, and the final scenes on the Silver Bridge are as tense and suspenseful as they are exciting. It's a very well-done climax, both dramatically and from a technical standpoint. A fine way to finish the film.Overall, this is a deeply eerie, surreal piece of work. Nightmarish really is the best word for it. It also has interesting characters and some emotional moments. I'm a big fan.

These people have a slightly askewed perspective of what is right, what is wrong and how it all comes together.  These are the people that are always asking why?  Why does something happen and in the greater scheme of things, how does it all matter?  Is there really a reason for everything or do some things just happen....because?The Mothman Prophecies is a riveting story about how some people seem just slightly ahead of the rest of us.  It is a story of trusting your feelings and not going mad or getting committed in the process.  And finally it is one of the scariest films I have ever seen.  Make no mistake about that.Based on true events.I read an article that stated that this is a film that Hollywood actually had to tone down.  In most cases, when film makers get a hold of material, they have to beef it up to make it more palpable for an audience.  But this is just the opposite.  Mark Pellington had to simmer some of the events in the film because he felt that if they actually filmed what was purportedly claimed, the audience would not believe the absurdity those events.  If that is the case, it frightens me to think what was left out because as it stands, this film is on the brink of utter temerity.  There is a head first slide into the bizarre and the film never fails to literally chill your bones.  No film that I can think of, and that includes my favourites like Jaws, Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street, has made me feel as helpless, insignificant or as small as this film does.Richard Gere plays John Klein, which one can only assume is really a character based on the novelist John A. Keel, who wrote about the events the film is based on.  He is a Washington Post reporter who has just bought a new house with his wife, whom he loves very much.  After a horrible car accident, his wife is hospitalized and just before she dies, she draws numerous pictures of what can only be described as an evil looking moth like creature, or perhaps even the Angel of Death.  She begs the question to John, You didn't see it did you?  Which begs the question to us, why not?Soon after, John ends up in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, and has no recollection of arriving there.  Here he meets Sgt. Connie Parker, played by Laura Linney and Gordon and Denise Smallwood, two of the locals.  Soon after he arrives, strange things begin to happen and shortly he and Connie become entangled in an imbroglio with mysterious implications.  Many of the locals claim they have seen something similar to what John's wife drew just before her death.  And Gordon, played with pure twilight zonesque manerisms by Will Patton, seems to be the most affected by this phenomenon.  He begins to hear voices, predicts future disasters, and finally claims to have met a mysterious figure.  All the while Klein begins to see and hear unexplainable things.  And here in, in my opinion, lies the key to the film.Mark Pellington, John A. Keel and screenwriter Richard Hatem, seem to explore the subliminal irrational workings of the unknown.  There are too many subtle, yet distinct elements that show up in the film.  But they are not at the surface, they are just beneath.  They're in front of our eyes the whole time, but only if you look hard enough.  Much of this film deals with paranormal activities and the paranoid revelations of the people in one town.  But it doesn't stop there.  Klein is from a town six hours away and eventually he seeks the opinion of a man in Chicago who wrote a book that claims he felt the same things.  So there are people that have experienced these unexplainable phenoms all over the country.  And this is where the film goes off into a level that I have never seen before.In order for people to have seen this figure or to be able to comprehend it, the film suggests that there has to be an open mind.  As an old proverb once said, the mind is like a parachute, it only works if you open it.  Klein seems to have his eyes and mind wide open after his wife's death.  He hasn't quite let go of her and this somehow enables him to communicate with whatever it is that is out there.  There are times when whatever it is seems ripe with duplicity but more times than not, whatever this figure says, what he predicts, what he prophecises, it comes true.  Klein's wife's death marks the nascency of his exploration into the abnormal.The theory of the unknown is what is dissected in such infintismal but succinct ways, that on a first viewing, you may not recognize them.  We hear stories about people being committed to psyche hospitals because of their failed attempted interpretations.  We hear of people that claim they are being watched by a higher being, but feeling this is not really God-like and not really evil.  It is just an entity.  We see people predict future disasters, we see dreams that prophecize death.  And all the while, these people are looked upon as being pariahs.  It is much easier to get up, go to work and watch television than it is to think and perhaps accept the fact that there is something just beyond our control that lurks in murky places in our minds.  There is even further sublime evidence that the director and writers feel this way.  There are constant anomalous images filmed with an ethereal glance.  These are images that we now take for granted without batting an eyelash.  Things like phones, televisions, pictures and electricity are all given to us in metaphoric and literal glimpses.  The creators of this film seem to be telling us that if we can believe in the use of technology, technology like capturing a moment in time on a piece of paper or if we can receive someone's voice transmitting hours away through a few cords and wires, then why is it preposterously inconceivable that Dark Angels or Mothmen really do exist?  Perhaps, like the film tells us, they only exist to those of us that can open our stagnant minds a little more than the next person.More times than can be counted, horror films insult us with loud computer generated noises and blood that seeps from the walls and CG monsters that chase characters that no one cares about.  It is easier to make a horror movie like the modern version of the Haunting or the modern version of 13 Ghosts.  Those are paint by number horror flicks that require no thought and no effort.  But when you get a master like Shyamalan and now Pellington, creators that are intransigent in their beliefs and vision, it creates pictures that not only scare you to your very soul, they create pictures that open your eyes and minds to whole other possibilities.  Mark Pellington has now proven to me that he is a master.  Arlington Road was a surprising film that left you paralyzed with fear and your mind spewing questions long after the curtains came up.  The Mothman Prophecies (especially for horror fans) will invoke discussions long after the lights come on.  I realize this review may be a little long but this is the tip of the iceberg when it comes all that can be discussed in the film.  There is a whole other religious element to the movie that hasn't even been explored.  For instance, notice that both major events in the film happen on Christmas Eve.  Why?One final note to critics that lambaste this film for all of it's so called short comings.  True, this film does not offer an explanation or a true conclusion to what took place.  But isn't that just the perfect note for it to end on?  According to the prophet-like character, Alexander Leek, you are not supposed to understand this phenom.  He tells Klein that you will go mad trying to figure it out.  This is the only way to end the film.  In a lesser film with an inferior director and writer, this film would have culminated with Klein and Connie finding some ancient manuscript in the basement of the library that tells them how to destroy it.  They would have went to hallowed ground and summoned it and gotten rid of it.  But this is not the tenth sequel of Friday the 13th and this certainly isn't ( with all due respect to Miner and Cunningham) Steve Miner and Sean Cunningham.  This is an astute director teamed with a cunning and observant writer who believe in the pulchritude and darkness of the story and give it the respect that it deserves.  This is not only one of the best horror films I have ever seen, it is one of the best films I have experienced in my 30 years.  This is the pinnacle of film making from all parties involved.10 out of 10.....A MASTERPIECE BY A MASTER OF MANIPULATION***One final note.  I just wanted to give special mention to the entire sound crew who did such a brilliant job with this film.  Pellington and Hatem collaborated beautifully to give me one of the most harrowing experiences I have been privy to in a theater, but the film would not have been quite as pulse pounding if it weren't for the sound team.  Kelly Cabral, Pud Cusack, Claude Letessier, David Parker, Ross Simpson and Mark Jan Wlodarkiewicz working with musical composers Tom Hajdu, Andy Milburn and Jeff Rona created some of the creepiest sounds and musical overtures in quite some time.  When you think of great music and sounds from the horror genre, you think of Carpenter's eerie piano piece from Halloween, Charles Bernstein's dream-like haunting score from Nightmare On Elm Street and John Williams ominous cello from Jaws.  This is on par with all of those.  And even though this team of musicians may never know it, your work is appreciated by all of who love horror films.  Thanks.

I was filled with dread as the credits appeared over a meaningless running shot of office fluorescent lights and close-ups of everyday, irrelevant, inherently unscary objects. As the film progresses we get more irrelevant close-ups, disorienting angles, hand-held camera shots, rapid editing and fast drum-beat soundtrack. And more close-ups. Soon you'll be wishing you took some dramamine. The movie tries to make EVERYTHING scary, with the result that nothing seems scary. There are a few standard jolts when something appears out of nowhere  - the usual filmic way of saying Boo. But after a dozen times of the now-cliche camera zooming to and away from a character, the panicked look he's left with seems probably caused by a sudden camera in the face rather than a ghost. The creepiest-potential moment when Indrid Cole (aka Kindred Spirit?) phones our hero is dissipated by the excessive layering of visuals. Soon any plot or sense of realism is lost - what about our hero's job? what day or night is it? what does he do most of the time in Point Pleasant? why and how does his initial meeting with a young couple happen at night in the quarry instead of the day, and do they really mention all the sexual details we see as they relate their mothman encounter? All the irrelevent camera shots encourage the viewer to ponder irrelevent questions Is that little guy in the sound lab making a music CD of his glass-lip rubbing? Do ethereal mothfolk really leave slime when hit by a car, and are there accident attorney mothpeople that represent them in mothcourt? To make something creepy or uncanny you need some realism to subvert, as one can see in One step beyond and Xfiles. By becoming more and more erratic, this movie not only seems unbelievable but manages to undermine the credibility of the real events.

Based on true events, the film examines a series of inexplicable occurrences through the eyes - and mind - of one man played by Richard Gere. The plot sounds creepy and the fact that its based on true events sure makes it more engaging. The film looks and sounds scary as well and there are a few scenes that are bound to get underneath your skin. The film is still kind of disappointing as they don't really explain the movie so well and your left with too many unanswered questions. Sometimes its hard to take the movie seriously as there are some scenes that don't make sense or that the scene kind of feels like a joke. Like said before though, the film should still creep underneath your skin. Richard Gere stars and he gives a very good performance. He makes up for starring in that awful film called Autumn in New York. Laura Linney also does a good and these two really keep the film moving. Mark Pellington directs and he does a good job of keeping the film at a nice pace and making the film look creepy. The ending was done decently and it sure makes you think about what happens. The Mothman Prophecies will leave its mark on you and you may have trouble getting it out of your head when its time to go to sleep. The film is almost two hours long so you may start to get bored if you find the film to be stupid. Pretty much if you like the X-Files or The Forgotten then you should enjoy this thriller. The Mothman Prophecies may not be top notch thriller but its still worth checking out and will make a good rental to watch at night. Rating 6.7/10 a sometimes scary thriller that's worth checking out.

I am a West Virginian who visits Pt. Pleasant often because it is an interesting town with Revolutionary War history and such, and I can say that this film is mostly fiction, but that's okay!The true facts are these  Many different people saw the mothman creatures in the late 60's in the Pt. Pleasant area.  There were no direct warnings or communications, simply specters without explanation.  These phantoms were taken seriously only because--as noted by Laura Linney in the film--they were seen not by flakes or freaks, but by responsible members of the community.The Silver Bridge did collapse after a period of the mothman sightings, and they were never seen or reported again in the region since.It should be noted that in this, region the mothman sightings and the bridge collapse are seen as two separate incidents.  People around here really don't perceive the mothmen as auguries of the bridge collapse. However connecting those dots for the book and film creates for a clever scenario--barring any disrespect to those who died in the bridge collapse.That most of this film is a trumped up version of the actual events shouldn't matter.  The film is merely exploring the scenario, and by using a real town with a real story, it draws us into the sense of community and fear that could pervade if such things did occur.The film is very well done and very effective in its use of paranoia and our fear of the unknown.  There is no axe murderer roaming the woods; no monsters shown with giant fangs.  Only the brief, fleeting images of the mothmen and their unexplained presence.Director Mark Pellington is great at using very few tricks to accomplish a lot of atmosphere.  He is respectful to the people of Pt. Pleasant and West Virginia, and never takes the low road of playing the people off as rubes. It is that smart decision which makes this film work.  If we didn't respect the community, we would never be drawn into this world.Richard Gere gives his usual excellent performance, and continues to be one of the most under-appreciated actors when it comes award time each year. He is the definition of a rational and intelligent man drawn into a situation that overwhelms him.Laura Linney is also excellent, and as a West Virginian myself, I must say she plays a Mountaineer (our parlance for West Virginian) better than any actors I can think of since those in Matewan.  She never condescends to the character, and employs an excellent dialect which is just as subtle as the dialect one would find in Pt. Pleasant, instead of the overbearing hillbilly dialects other actors often employ.  Linney continues to amaze with subtlety and I am always looking forward to more of her work.Debra Messing has a brief role, but she does make a mark and get a chance to show that she has dramatic acting chops which she refined onstage in roles such as Angels in America.  I would like to see her in more dramatic work since I enjoy her comedic work on Will & Grace each week.I also thought Alan Bates made a marvelous turn in the film as a professor (in more sense than one) of the mothman.  He has some great lines, including, when Gere asks why the mothmen don't explain their presence if they are superior creatures  You are superior to a cockroach; do you ever bother to explain yourself to a cockroach?At the end of the film a title says that the cause of the bridge collapse was never known.  This is a classic example of Hollywood having fun, since the cause was never a mystery at all.  The bridge was designed with what was called an I-bar, which meant the entire bridge was held up with one single joint!  It rusted and snapped under the weight of stopped holiday traffic (as shown in the film).  Because of this, such bridges all over the nation were shut down and subsequently replaced.  The Silver Bridge collapse remains the worst bridge disaster in American history.  The collapse scenes are terrifying, yet respectful of the actual tragedy.Kudos to Pellington and his marvelous cast for making such a thought-provoking and engaging film.It should be noted that Pt. Pleasant has a great sense of humor about the mothmen, and they even have events for people to come and enjoy the lore. If you are in the region stop by downtown and find some fun paraphernalia.

Is THAT good.The movie portraits beautifully the connection between this reality and other planes of existence. If fact, it does so with such a skill and perfection that you will almost feel a presence in your room watching the movie with you.From beginning to end, this movie is reckless with the viewer, not allowing him or her to go out of the uneasy feeling. Some scenes are disturbing but not in the way you would expect since the director seems to be a master of the unseen, the feeling always comes from ourselves and what we imagine it will happen and not because we actually see it on screen. This technique is somewhat similar to first shymalan's movies but I dare say this movie is far more developed in that sense.Visuals are stunning yet almost nill in the effects department, mood and scenery is second to none, you will FEEL being in that place and feeling what the actors feel. Soundtrack follows perfectly with creepy tunes and perfect sound editing. It is unbelievable how good the sound is handled in this one, not a single quick scare scene, sounds are used to build up tension in you and never to get cheap scares.This movie is the mother of all paranormal suspense thrillers with so much focus on the paranormal that it will creep you out like no other, it is really commendable how much the director knows about this topic and the way people accept it inside the movie.Suffice to say that for me this movie enters the top 10 for all time best paranormal suspense movies I've seen in my entire life, seriously.If you didn't see it, please, go watch it, you wont regret it!

Again, I don't get-off, on slasher or horror flicks. The thing that does get to me and always has, is, things that could or did actually happened. The acting, albeit I am not a real, Gear fan per say, but the character that he played was done to the bone. This is the story of John and Mary Klein, newlyweds.I felt the hair stand up on the back of my neck, in 2002 when I went to see this. It was the perfect time of year for a story of mystery and horror. It was set right in fall, turning into winter. Debra Messing was a young and beautiful wife to Richard Gear's character, they seemed at very least, to be the perfect little young couple. From, the house hunting mission that they were on, to the trip back to their home, when the first symbol appeared, it was very chilling. The type of scare, that is deep settling and the onset of an abrupt frigidness encompasses your body. The man that he John went to meet in regard to the 'phone-call' played by the very talented Will Patton, (Gordon Smallwood) was an eerie outing, that proved deadly for Patton's character. The Priest that met with Klein, to explain some of the occurrences, but not all. Right on down to the drive that should have taken four or five hours, that seemed only, twenty minutes to the primary character, played by Richard Gear. I can say I have felt that I have been in that situation before. A sort of 'time' mystery traveling. I walked out of the theater, with a thoroughly washed out emotional chill factor inside of me. It was strange. The real stuff always is to me though.A couple years later, I saw it again in 2004, at home after renting it and with the lights out, at 12 midnight, the chilling effect doesn't grow weaker! This film, whether some are impressed or not, is a solid 'spine-tingler'. I rarely get moved by a film with shocking, or even scary stories, but as this one was told, I have to say, this was brilliant in it's execution. The players, were convincing, with these people at the helm of the story, it came across feeling cold and real. The hairs on my neck stood up a couple times! For me thats quite an accomplishment. The temp in my home seemed cooler, as the story went on. The fact that there were no phony-phony looking effects of ghoulish, slasher type action, in the story made it hit home even deeper. This was a highly well crafted thrill cast. I recommend this for anyone looking to be mesmerized by a well-toldstory,that will intrigue just about anyone.

Most horror films are ostensibly slapstick, caricatured and full of overstatement of a very broadly recognised fear; death. The vehicles for this fear are usually monsters, murderers or disasters of which the victims are helpless; though these do the job of shocking us out of our seats, their effect, given their near ridiculousness, rarely lingers. The intensity of The Mothman Prophecies, however, is based from the outset on the loss of a perfect love, and our very limited nature in the grandness of existence, despite all other things that happen supernaturally, this is what truly haunts our protagonist. It is in this, that the helplessness which brings about fear finds its vessel.Another interesting point, is that these supernatural moth-like beings that turn up before a disaster are not trying to kill anyone, yet they are (or should I say Indrid Cold is) utterly terrifying. When Klein receives THE phone call (you know which one!), I felt the very world-view that keeps me feeling safe very much under attack. Whenever I am in a dimly lit room, alone, I wonder how shaken I would be if such an event happened to me. The explanation for this, that there may be things beyond our primitive nature and capability to understand, is profoundly reasonable...Which brings me to my point Most horror films are sold on the merit that they make you jump (sudden knife attacks, monsters leaping out, etc). The horror in The Mothman Prophecies is something entirely different, something profound, poignant, existential. It is a film that will reward the insightful, reflective and empathic individual (not the thrill-seeker), and will continue to scare and compel such individuals long after viewing ( for these reasons, I would recommend watching this by yourself).It is the departure from your typical horror/thriller which I believe warrants a 10 for The Mothman Prophecies. It is a film that adds something unique to the rich cinema tapestry. I could talk about the competent performances, the strange cinematography or the alleged origins of the story, but what really sets this film apart is the way it scares like no other in the genre by which it has been defined.

It is of little consequence I suppose - cerebral implosion has always interested me as a physiological condition. That this great film has inspired a universal rating of only 6.6 bears testament to my belief that today's viewing audience are, for the most part cretins - or getting there! I realise also that these comments most likely condemn this review never to be published, since the IMDb frowns heavily (and funnily enough I agree with this policy) on the slating of other IMDb reviewers. This particular film however incites my anger towards these negative and terminally limited people, like no other I can recall! Together with RED CORNER, AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN, PRETTY WOMAN and PRIMAL FEAR (not necessarily in that order), THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES is up there with Gere's best work. It's up there with ANYONE'S best work! In essence a brilliant movie length episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE, it was always going to be a failure to those expecting MOTH MAN to be leaping out of the screen with slavering maw (the cretins better look that one up!), rancid breath and flesh-stripping claws. This is no action movie as one cranially displaced reviewer complained. It is a film that you must work WITH, listen TO and build upon! Mark Pellington directed his guts out with this one and he has produced an unequivocal winner, vastly superior in my view to even ARLINGTON ROAD which though interesting was a bit iffy towards the conclusion I thought.The briefest of plot outlines follows. Gere is a reporter for the Washington Post. He is very much in love with his wife. Following an auto run-in, she is hospitalised and diagnosed with a rare form of brain tumor. Before she dies she leaves several extremely strange sketches of something on a notepad. Gere later finds himself on a road to Pleasant County having no idea how he got there (and wishing to divulge nothing further) comes across many uniquely odd and supernatural turns. He is convinced some terrible tragedy will strike the township. Does it? Is he one step short of a psycho ward? Is this the greatest suspense movie of all time?  Maybe you had better watch it!Will Patton gives an absolutely riveting support performance but there again - EVERYONE here is just about out of their tree. Cinematography, script, production values are ALL just superb. Despite what others may say, there is not one boring moment in this film if you have ANY awareness at all! The conclusion (and let's forget the minority who think they saw it coming - THEY DIDN'T) is so well done. both emotionally and effect wise, it lifts the film so far above others of its ilk its not funny!

The Texas Chainsaw Massacre's brutality and nightmarish setting make the movie's inspiration(the Ed Gein murders) something to look into, especially since the events inspired Psycho and The Silence of the Lambs. The Amityville Horror is a question of truth or myth. Was that house haunted? We don't know, mostly because Hollywood had to exaggerate everything. However, 2002's The Mothman Prophecies comes along, and when one is knowing of the real story and John A. Keel's book, the movie makes you think differently about true story horror. Music video director Mark Pellington has given us a movie that not only interests genre fans, but actually pulls through on bringing you a big case of the creeps.Washington Post writer John Klein is happily driving with his wife Mary one night after going house hunting. Suddenly, something catches Mary's eye and the car swerves and crashes. John visits Mary in the hospital before she dies, and one of the last things she asks him is You didn't see it, did you? We ask ourselves, what exactly did she see? We don't know. Strangely, John finds himself in the West Virginia town of Point Pleasant within hours, where weird things are occurring. Lights are flashing across the sky, John is getting strange phone calls, and people are reporting that they've seen a large winged creature with red beaming eyes. John teams up with Point Pleasant sheriff Connie Mills to discover what is going on in this town. What is the moth-like creature attacking this town's locals? What does it want? Is it intending to do harm or is it an omen of things to come? When faced with the observations presented in Keel's book, The Mothman Prophecies only makes a few minor changes, including the time the actual events took place. The story shifts from the 1960's to present day. But otherwise, it stays very true to its source material, which leaves the audience completely in awe. Director Pellington and screenwriter Richard Hatem refuse to let the story be fabricated, and we love them all the more for it.This supernatural chiller keeps its suspense factor high by not treating the audience like idiots. It doesn't stick to any of the usual horror standards. No one says I'll be right back. The film doesn't succumb to boobs and gore. The script keeps the relationship between John and Connie from turning the movie into a sappy love story, which makes the leading characters more sympathetic and pure at heart, thanks to Richard Gere and Laura Linney's great performances.What really gets to you about The Mothman Prophecies is that you are left questioning right up to the end what this creature's motivations are. You never know if the apparition exists to warn people of future disasters or to bring fear into the hearts of the townspeople. We're also not really sure if the Mothman is actually real. What if it's just a figment of imagination, what our minds want us to see and believe? We're always more frightened when we don't know what we're supposed to be scared of. A nice addition is Pellington's decision to stick to the less is more formula, and he does it extremely well. He never shows us the monster, only flashes of light in varied colors and what we our told of the creature's appearance. Only true fans of horror will appreciate this.All of the tension builds up to a perfectly staged and nerve-rattling climax that poses more questions. The film builds slowly to produce this giant ball of supernatural horror. This may test the patience of moviegoers who take their horror with ridiculous explanations and CGI effects. But the story of The Mothman Prophecies was always meant to leave you with questions. The movie is scarier that way. By the time the credits have rolled, you are emotionally devastated, stunned, and ultimately freaked out. What could have been an X Files wannabe turned into something much more horrifying than anything The X Files could have created. The Mothman Prophecies is truthful horror at its finest.

The incident originates with the actual events which took place during the years 1966 and 67, in West Virgina. The strange and eerie tale captured the attention of many avid paranormal investigators and fans of the supernatural alike. The story concerns John Klein (Richard Gere) a serious reporter working for the Washington Post. Believing he has discovered true happiness, he and his wife (Debra Messing) select and purchase a new house hoping to live happily after. Unfortunately, fate intervenes and he mysteriously ends up in West Virgina searching for the original incident concerning the phenomenal legend of the Mothman. Although there is no actual proof of the winged creature, Klein continues to gather all sorts of evidence such as remarkable sightings, appearances and unexplained events. None of which prove the legend or disprove it's manifestations.

Richard Gere stars as John Klein, a Washington newspaper reporter who encounters a moth-like apparition driving home with his wife late one night. His wife dies mysteriously after the ensuing car accident and Klein becomes convinced this apparition was to blame. When he hears of similar sightings (a tall, thin, humanoid creature with moth-like wings and red glowing eyes) in a rural West Virginia town, he becomes obsessed with finding the truth.Overall, this movie leaves you unsettled. The scares are like fleeting movement in the corner of a dark room. The viewer's discomfort is related to what's not seen and not understood. The more Klein tries to learn the truth, the more it seems clear he's in a losing battle. He looks like a man caught in a giant hamster wheel, running in circles, never moving any closer to understanding the reality of the Mothman. Over time, he begins to get calls from a voice calling itself Indrid Cold. These are some of the creepier phone conversations you'll ever hear. Is this really the Mothman contacting Klein with strange prophecies? Or is Klein just losing his grip on reality?The film is very loosely inspired by John A. Keel's book describing actual events that happening in West Virginia some 30-40 years ago. Other than the Appalachian setting and the general Mothman mythology, the film doesn't share much in common with the book. The book is far less interesting. Keel was essentially a UFO conspiracy theorist and associated the Mothman appearances with many UFO sightings that occurred during the same period. The movie is much more sophisticated (although highly fictionalized) and keeps the Mothman's origins far more mysterious.This film is for viewers who aren't afraid to be left with a lot of questions. It's clear early on Klein has become involved with something that's probably beyond human comprehension. The physical manifestation of the Mothman is never clearly seen or understood; it's more like a dark, malevolent shadow hanging over the small town. The atmosphere is relentlessly dark, creepy and unforgettable. You'll definitely be worried about a pair of red, glowing eyes appearing outside your window at night.

I guess the word for it now would be 'thriller,' and thrill it does.Based on a true story from Point Pleasant, West Virginia in 1967, the Mothman takes place in present 2001, or thereabouts. It's the story of a newspaper reporter who finds himself in said town on his way to interview the governor. There he stumbles across several bizarre occurrences; namely repeated sightings by the townsfolk of a not-quite-seen ethereal creature, and how these strange tales seem to intertwine with the reporter's own life.The director, Mark Pellington (whose directorial credits include the mediocre movie Arlington Road and the music video of Jeremy by Pearl Jam) has created a mood and a tension in film that I don't think has appeared since The Exorcist in 1973. And he does so without blood, gore, or cheap scares.And only a PG-13 rating.Mr. Pellington falls backs on some outdated tricks like good acting, excellent cinematography, and an absolutely stunning soundtrack. Close-ups of the actors' faces here convey more real terror than in all the Friday the 13th films combined. The musical score sets the mood from scene 1 to the finale; dark and foreboding, tense and pensive. Sound work this good should have earned an Oscar nomination. The camera work is beyond reproach, as well. Sometimes long shots, setting a mood, sometimes jerky, fuzzy, or distorted like a funhouse mirror, all perfect to what needs to be conveyed - - without giving away too much.The acting, also, is top notch. Richard Gere, Laura Linney, Will Patton, and Will & Grace's Debra Messing all convey a range of emotions not seen in modern day thrillers in sometime.If there is a flaw to the Mothman Prophecies, it's that the townspeople are too quick to tell a stranger of their paranormal experiences. A moments' hesitation, a shifting away of the eyes, the use of a softer-spoken voice in public would have made the stories and the characters come more alive, and added only a minute or two to the films' overall length.Counting Memento, this is the second great film I've seen in the past thirteen months.

The plot, although not particularly gripping, is extremely engaging. The Mothman, in essence, is a movie monster. Yet the fear factor lies in his in his angel-of-death-like omniscience and omnipresence. The film effectively sums up the Mothman's enigmatic nature in the lines John Klein I think we can assume that these entities are more advanced than us.

The film is full of beautiful and powerfully crafted motifs, right down to the scene transitions. The various appearances of the Mothman, the motifs of the two red eyes and the Y shape, and the creepy out-of-time occurrences (i.e. a dead man placing a phone call several hours after his time of death) give the film its creepy and enticing edge. I applaud Mark Pellington and his team for the most masterfully crafted film I have seen to date. This is a definite must-see for anyone who enjoys a good psychological thriller.

Even before the film was made, I read a lot of books and web sites (remember the fun Mothman web site at Geocities started in the mid-90s?) about the Mothman events in Point Pleasant and when the movie came out, I was excited and a little disappointed. I was excited because a movie about the Mothman was being made but I was a bit disappointed that the setting of the film starring Richard Gere and directed by Mark Pellington was set in the present and not in the 1960s, when the real events occurred. So, I was obviously ambivalent in seeing MP. And though the final product has some weaknesses, the overall effect of MP is pretty good  because many images and moments linger in the mind days or weeks after watching it.Before reviewing the movie, there are several things to point out between the movie/book vs the Mothman myth. The book on which the movie is based upon is an interpretation from the author of what the Mothman is. The idea that the Mothman is some sort of harbinger of doom is John Keel's own personal theory of what the Mothman might be and not necessarily what the Mothman actually is. It's not what the people who witnessed the Mothman or the people living in Point Pleasant generally thought it was. For instance, the Mothman was always associated with UFOs (which the movie almost leaves out entirely) because people saw strange lights in and around the time people witnessed the Mothman. So, in other words, one shouldn't take the film's concept of the Mothman verbatim. The screenplay's and the director's idea of what the Mothman is is only a supposition. But (and this a big but) it's a pretty darn good supposition, I have to say. But still a supposition.This liberal interpretation of the Mothman events doesn't mean The Mothman Prophecies is a terrible movie. It's not. It's pretty darn good one, even with its weaknesses. The mood and overall creepy atmosphere of MP is perfect. One couldn't ask for more. In fact, the atmosphere of MP is so good that it easily overcomes the film's many weaknesses, like how the story concentrates almost entirely on the Richard Gere character. I didn't mind that the film invested a good deal of the story on John Klein. Some of the scenes with Gere alone in the motel room are excellent and effective. But after watching Gere act alone in his motel room or alone here or alone there, the film inadvertently becomes a bit too claustrophobic for its own good. Certainly when one considers how many people were affected by the events of the Mothman sightings. One wonders why the film didn't spend more time with the people in PP. MP shouldn't have been only about John Klein but more about the people of Point Pleasant and their sightings, etc. Having the story revolve only around one solitary character can stretch most storylines to their limits. Numerous scenes of Gere talking on the phone become repetitious and a bit much to watch. A better way of showing how lonely the Klein character was is by having more people around and show them having lives and going about their daily existence, the opposite of what Klein was experiencing after the death of his wife. This would have been a way of showing how lonely the Klein character was without having the film end up being seemingly populated by a single solitary main character. Then there are the scenes with Gere in Chicago with that old man, which, unfortunately, are very cliched. They don't belong in a movie like this. And the film shouldn't have ended just after the big event. It makes the film feel like the disaster was the whole point of the story.But even with these weak points, The Mothman Prophecies is worth watching and absorbing. It's very well filmed. There are several memorable scenes, certainly the ending and the plethora of subliminal imagery peppered throughout the film. The liberal and ambivalent interpretation of how they show the Mothman to be is actually great because it's never dogmatic. The ambivalent screenplay and impressionistic direction by Pellington leaves the Mothman myth open to other interpretations. In  fact, an actual account of the events in Point Pleasant can still be made, as a movie or a documentary. There's enough  room for two or three Mothman movies.The Mothman Prophecies is one of my favorite films of 2002. Even with its faults, it still beats most of the stuff churned out by Hollywood (Signs, Dragonfly, etc).

I've read the book this is based on numerous times. And consider it to be mostly true (based on some experiences I've had in paranormal investigation myself).So I was afraid to see what the movie would like, since it basically tried to turn a fairly weird and somewhat dry book into a fictional movie. But they did a great job. Even Richard Gere, who I think is a terrible actor normally, and someone who I have trouble taking seriously because of the urban legends about him, did a great job. All of the acting in this is superb. Laura Linney and Will Patton in particular.To the average person, this movie probably won't make a heck of a lot of sense, though the ending might be more of a surprise for people not familiar with the book. It's also not the typical horror or suspense movie. There's really no monster or boogey man out to get anyone here, not exactly. There's something, but just what it is isn't really known*, not even at the end. Or just what it's trying to do. Except perhaps drive people crazy. It's more creepy than scary, I think.Perhaps that's why Gere works well in this movie. He's pretty good at looking confused.But beyond that, there is something of a human interest story. We see how Gere's character grapples with the death of his wife. Ultimately he has to make a choice between holding on to his dead wife or moving on to someone else. Gere actually does some decent acting here, doing a good job of showing his grief and turmoil and longing for his dead wife. So I have to give him a lot of credit, actually.What I also really liked about the movie, was that it was more or less real. Yes, it was heavily fictionalized, but even so, it mostly takes liberties with the characters. It's actually a fairly accurate depiction of dealing with entities such as Indrid Cold, and what they are like.*the movie pretty much made up the mentions of mothmen being seen elsewhere.

I'm a big fan of horror, suspense,and thrillers. If it's scary and the story intrigues me enough (even if it doesn't) I'm there to see it. I saw the trailer for the Mothman and I immediately wanted to see it. The director of the movie also directed Arlington Road another good flick about terrorism in quiet suburbia. Here he went a little deeper in the realm of paranoia and connected it with the realm of paranormal (so we believe). Every frame of the flick was dark and foreboding, we (the audience) always knew that something was watching him(Richard Gere) and we (well... me personally) couldn't wait for the first moment the main character in the movie and the Mothman were going to speak or see each other. The cast performance was pretty good. They were pretty basic on a character level, we have a city slicker trying to investigate the sightings in a small town, while at the same time trying to fit in while he is staying there, (actually he was brought there mysteriously). The point where the characters do shine is near the end of the flick where Laura Linneys character (the love interest), flat out tells Richard Gere that he is imagining things and he needs to get on with his life. Sorry for the banter but the point is that Richard Gere breaks down and we see and ask ourselves is he going to continue this quest? Does he answer the phone knowing it could be the haunting Mothman on the other line? Or does he let it ring and realize that there could be no Mothman and he should get on with his life. This wasn't an Oscar winning scene, but in the context of the movie it worked well. The minor downside to the flick is the ending seems to dilute the mystery of this Mothman, but that is just my opinion, see the ending for yourself and you might think differently. Sorry for the banter but it truly was a great flick.

Having interviewed more 'contactees' than any other human being on earth, Keel wrote what is considered the bible of contactee 'culture' in 'The Mothman Prophecies', an account of two years (1966-1967) he spent investigating strange happenings in the little town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia, culminating in a disaster which may of may not have been predicted by the contacting entities. Keel's position is one of fascinated agnosticism and he absolutely refrains from debating whether all these strange phenomena have an actual foothold in reality. The film is a fictional account inspired by this book. I was at first suspicious that the scriptwriters had only borrowed the book's title and location, but there is more than that. The script incorporates at least a dozen of the 200 or so narratives which make up Keel's book. They work them into a very coherent piece of work, although no attempt is made to present the events in chronological order or even turn back the clock to 1966. The main character (Richard Gere)'s interest in the Point Pleasant events is tied in with the grief he feels for his departed wife. As such, the movie becomes as much a reflection on the psychology of mourning as on the existence of a parallel reality. This film has a kinship in this with a lot of Ingmar Bergman's more hermetic movies like 'Hour of the Wolf' (both in content and style), a film like Atom Egoyan's 'The Sweet Hereafter' and the quality of respectful grief which gave 'Titanic' its otherworldly quality. The main difference here is that the village of Point Pleasant seems to be grieving for its victims a long time before the disaster actually happens, because of the prophetic elements of the story. The film is suitably chilling and goes out of its way to at least attempt to make sense of the big question Are the phenomena real or purely subjective? The extraordinary talent of actors like Laura ('You can count on me') Linney (as a police officer who learns to care for the hero, as she does for everyone else in town) and Alan Bates (as a retired paranormal investigator) and a brief but memorable appearance by Debra Messing as Gere's wife complement Richard Gere's 'serenely concerned' persona. Special mention must be made of the inventive cinematography, the unobtrusive but highly evocative special effects, the art direction which makes a small town look even more ordinary and generic in its blandness and the elaborate soundscapes which are an important part of this movie's appeal.

Still, you feel empathy for his character -- we've all been screwed around by forces beyond our control at one point or another in our lives.  And I wish Debra Messing had more screen time -- she's very effective though in the brief role she has; I'll be watching Will and Grace more regularly after seeing this.What amazed me about this film, however, was Richard Hatem's script -- he had a heck of a challenge in taking John Keel's lackluster, repetitive, scatter-shot book and crafting a story around the events in it (NOTE  DO NOT READ THE BOOK before seeing the movie!  It will take away from your enjoyment of the film's climax! And like I said, it's not that good anyway).Mark Pellington grabs you with a slam-bang opening and draws you in with his unique visual stylings.  The audio was also very effective (Pellington mentioned hiring the sound designer before the director of photography). Make sure you see it in a theater with digital surround -- the soundtrack is that important.I look forward to Pellington's next film -- he's definitely a director to watch, and with THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES joins other unique directors like David Fincher and Spike Jonze.Highly recommended if you enjoy thrillers.

I had no sympathy for the loss of his wife (especially it goes she's dead, it's suddenly 2 years later and life's all hunky dory). You need to be able to relate to his loss or feel it. I don't, if they'd spent less time in scenes where hardly anything happens and perhaps shown a bit of what happened in his life during the 2 years where he was coming to terms with losing his wife I might have had a bit more sympathy for him.Anyway he ends up in Point Pleasant, a nicely named town where folks see weird stuff and weird stuff happens. Most of the occurrences are too weird to be based on any kind of reality.Gere gets sucked into the madness and descends into it himself almost to the point of losing his job and everything that matters to him.The end of the film is it's only redeeming moment with the bridge collapse and even then that is far too over done and takes (surprise, surprise) far too long for the event to take place. This should have been shot really quickly with barely any time to react to the event.Gere's reaction to dive into the river to try and save the female cop is insane (especially with all the electrical cables hanging into the water, the fast flowing current, how cold the water would be in December). With all the debris falling into the water the likelihood of one or both of them escaping her car and safely reaching the surface was very low indeed.The ending is very weak indeed with them just saying they didn't know why the bridge collapsed and no-one every saw the Mothman again.Very poor indeed.

The Mothman Prophecies is one of the great horror films of our time &#150; matching the eerie tones of isolation and psychological deterioration from The Shining and delivering intelligent thrills instead of cheap scare tactics. It's a daring move for a film called The Mothman Prophecies not to actually feature any visuals of the titular creature, but that's exactly the case here &#150; the film falls back upon old-fashioned chills rather than modern-day thrills. Of the decade so far I would rank it as one of the finest of its genre without hesitation.The film purports to be based on a true story, and although numerous facts are twisted (not least of all that the actual events depicted in the film took place forty years ago and the protagonist of the film, strictly speaking, never really existed), it will easily appeal to those Mothman buffs out there as well as it will to regular audiences. The movie has some nice in-joke references (such as the fact that one character's name, Leek, is Keel spelled backwards &#150; the name of the author of the book Mothman is based upon) and Pellington clearly did his research prior to filming.The movie stars Richard Gere as a Washington reporter who loses his wife (Debra Messing) in a freak car crash. Two years pass and after a long day of work in the office and perpetual unrest, he sets out for a quiet drive to Baltimore. A couple hours later he finds himself hundreds of miles away in Point Pleasant, West Virginia &#150; a town experiencing bizarre happenings that somehow relate to the passing of his wife. People are seeing strange things men in black, demonic beings and a strange winged creature with blood red eyes.The Mothman Prophecies lets everything up to the viewer's imagination &#150; when the reporter gets a telephone call from a man named Indrid Cold who seems to have infinite knowledge and an alien voice, Pellington doesn't draw conclusions. Is Indrid the Mothman? Is Indrid from another world? We don't know &#150; making the proceedings all the more eerie.Some Mothman enthusiasts have claimed the film really doesn't focus enough solely on the Mothman, and tries to turn into a supernatural thriller rather than a documentary-style production on what actually happened in Point Pleasant in 1967. But to be fair, trying to compile all of the insane legends of the town's history into a single film would be disastrous. There exist many other odd events that occurred within the town during the time period of the Mothman sightings, but some of them are downright silly (such as author John A. Keel's alleged contact with extra-terrestrials and the theory that the Mothman is an escaped alien test subject the government had captured). Pellington takes the high road and lays the basics out on the table, and let's viewers draw their own conclusions.Perhaps the most intriguing thing about this film is the fact that Pellington does, in fact, turn his film into a psychological thriller rather than a true horror film. Except for the sloppy ending (which stinks of Hollywood interference), this is a dark, edgy, realistic and un-nerving movie. Like Kubrick's The Shining, it puts you inside the mind of a man driven to the brink of insanity &#150; in this case, fueled by the death of a loved one and pure obsession. There's an interesting twist towards the end of the film that provides some poignant reflection for Gere's character, when he is confronted with the possibility of speaking to his dead wife through the aid of Indrid Cold. But he's left with a big question what if it's not really his wife? How do you want to remember your wife? another character asks him. It's a very effective scene.Gere delivers a fine, surprisingly powerful performance as a grieving man &#150; the character is loosely based on Keel, but there are a lot of dramatic additions, such as the internal conflict involving the death of his wife and his spiritual link with the Mothman himself. But these are not distracting threads &#150; it provides a strong connection between Gere and the Mothman/Indrid Cold. This connection really drives the psychological tension of the film.Directorially this is a very promising example of Pellington's visual finesse behind the camera. Evoking Hitchcock, Kubrick, Polanski and other great artists, Pellington becomes, in many ways, the true star of this picture. The fragmented visuals accompanied by the creepy score by Tomandandy results in one of the finest horror-thrillers in recent memory &#150; a film that works on many levels and, despite some flaws (mainly towards the finale), is a perfect example of why directors are just as vital to a film as the story itself. A criminally underrated film that will hopefully grow in stature and recognition over time.

About 10 years ago I had several occasions to travel to Point Pleasant, WV and Gallipolis, Oh on business. The locals mentioned the old collapsed bridge and its location, but no one mentioned the Mothman sightings.  I suppose if they had, I might not have slept as well! This isn't a great movie, but it kept my interest all the way. Although it is based on accounts during 1966 and 1967 in West Virginia, the characters and even the dates are changed. For convenience, this movie set certain events on Christmas eve, events which actually happened on December 15th. It also shows several instances of the 'mothman' predicting future happenings. There's nothing wrong with any of that, if the authors wanted the change for dramatic effect, it just points out that this is intended to be a mostly fictional story and not strongly based on fact.Perhaps more interesting, once one has seen the movie, is to read a few of the websites devoted to the mothman sightings. Although many of the reports came from very reputable members of the community, there has never been any explanation of what this creature might have been. And, there was no indication that any prophesies were attributed to the mothman.The DVD has a good presentation, and the soundtrack is a highlight, one of the few that actually startled me at times when it was supposed to.

To compensate for the bad script, with slow plodding where nothing happens, Pellington chooses to use cinematography to create atmospheric mood to reflect the supernatural; overall I thought the cinematography was extremely distracting in places and was one of the main factors along with the script, which ultimately makes M.P's a cinematic disaster. Pellington has done much better than this with his superb Arlington Road which had a well crafted and pacey plot which made you want to hang on the back of your seat.Richard Gere didn't do much for me either... The only film I found his suitably convincing and sincere in was his role as the lawyer in Primal Fear which stars the wonderful Ed Norton.Someone stated that this should be movie of the year based on what they've seen so far.. I am going to decry that statement, and instead suggest this  movie is on par on par to being the worst turkey of the year, and one of the worst directed movies I've ever watched. I would not even recommend people watch this movie on video..If you want to watch a superior film from Mr. Pellington, and haven't seen Arlington Road, do yourself a big favour and give this movie a big berth, and hire A.R instead.I was lucky I didn't have to pay the $12.80 ticket admission price to see this 'mumbo jumbo' piece of cod's wallop.

The two antagonists, the mothman apparition and the prognosticating phone caller (who are never definitely proved to be the same entity) don't intentionally cause harm. The mothman is only shown vaguely in flashbacks, and just plays peeping tom. The phone caller isn't some psycho calling to announce his future crimes, he's more like the weatherman, and no one blames bad weather on the weatherman. So what's left besides the usual filmic scare tactics that lead nowhere, without even a plot or coherent story to fall back on? An exciting climax? The suspenseful 'can-we-prevent-the-prophecy-from-happening?' ending was much better done in The Night has a 1000 eyes. The Mothman Prophecies races into increasing chaos, without style or content, shot and edited without any human rhythm, which suggests a real moth was directing. It's no surprise that it induces motion sickness. The only discernible thread running through this is our hero's car which, aside from stalling out once, can hit an ethereal mothman, can travel 500 mile in 2 hours, and survive a collapsing bridge. I predict that in 2003 Ford will debut a new model, the Ford Mothman Explorer.

It's actually very good for about the first half or more. But then the story loses momentum and direction. The promise of the beginning part dissipates. Only in the climax does the story regain some kind of footing. The reason for this is that the story shifts away from the supernatural and toward the mental state of the obsessed Richard Gere, its protagonist. I think it has to do this. It also diverts into some sub-plots that really do not tie in that well with the main plot or augment it. These include the fate of the character played by Will Patton (and played well) and a man who wrote a book on similar phenomena and warns Gere off. Still, I liked the movie.This is a horror movie, having the classical central element of a horror movie which is the presence of the unexplained supernatural. There is a lot of that in this story and none of it is explained, as it cannot be explained in terms of the natural. One has to accept that limitation on stories like this. There is really not that much of an attempt to understand even the basic physical impossibility of Gere ending up where he has at the story's outset. If that's possible, then so are many other things.Instead, and rightly so, the story focuses on the more interesting questions of why Gere has been chosen, what he's expected to do, what he can or cannot accomplish, and what sorts of interactions he should seek and have with the supernatural spirit that has affected both him and other residents of the town of Point Pleasant. This is the heart of the story, and it makes for an engaging movie.This movie is also a beautifully-photographed neo-noir. It seems that neo-noir is a natural for telling some horror and sci-fi movies as well as the usual mysteries and crime stories.The movie expresses some decent philosophy within its context of supernatural fiction. I do not take this story as being true or even a facsimile of the events upon which it is based. Not at all. I take this as fiction inspired by whatever happened. Anyway, the philosophy is that the supernatural with respect to the dead has its realm and the natural has its realm, and it's best to keep them apart. Trying to step over the line can lead to madness. This is all expressed by Kate Winslet's character. The budding love story between her and Gere in the movie is handled very nicely.All in all, I think that the IMDb rating of 6.5 is about right, expressing that this movie is somewhat above par.

I love the sense of mystery woven throughout the film, as the bottom line is...we will never understand this mystery and perhaps, as Alan Bates' character asserts, we're not meant to. Maybe these scenarios are created by intelligent energies for their own purposes, maybe it's their idea of a movie or a joke, or maybe they just manipulate vulnerable people into believing lies to capture their souls. I was reminded of how the witches in Macbeth tell him a number of true prophecies, only to lure him into negative behaviors, but don't tell him the complete one at the end. We may just never know what the story is - I think we can only go by how it makes us feel. If it creates a bad feeling, it's probably a bad thing. And vice versa.The performances are uniformly excellent, especially Richard Gere, who is a much better and sensitive actor than I had realized before. Alan Bates is marvelous as the psychic researcher who got burned by his subject.

Richard Gere stars as newspaper columnist John Klein who early in the film gets into a car accident while his wife is driving. Mary (Debra Messing) swerves to avoid a creature and ends up dying shortly after of a brain tumor. Was it the strange black-winged, red-eyed creature that caused this? Two years later, Klein inexplicably finds himself in the small town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia when his car breaks down. In the town he finds dozens of reports of people who have seen this mothman and he decides to investigate. He teams up with local police officer Connie Mills (Laura Linney) as they document sightings, injuries, hallucinations and finally, strange prophecies foretelling deaths. Klein gets increasingly involved in the cases.This movie has a really solid first half. There's just enough sort-of explainable weirdness going on that you believe this is based on a true story and that Klein would stick around to see what is going on. As he uncovers some clues that may explain what happened to his wife, you start getting a bad feeling about the whole thing. Then we've got the creepy reports from people who have seen the creature, a strong message from an expert that warns him to stay away that further peak your curiosity and that increasing dread as you realize this guy is in way over your head. As I said before, it gets downright creepy and frightening when you finally start to learn about this strange Indrid Cold character. The unexplainable but kind of mundane stuff just keeps pilling up until you know something really bad is going to happen. Then the second half, the movie really switches gears and doesn't work nearly as well. It's like the director couldn't make up his mind as to whether he wanted to make a thriller that built itself up slowly, setting itself up for some big, but sparse scares, or a nutty supernatural monster movie about a possibly benevolent, possibly maleficent force that we as humans have no way of understanding. It ends up just being a bit of both and not paying off for either camp.Some of the problems in this movie are truly hard to describe because they have to do with the jarring switch in tone and atmosphere of the story. There's a scene where we see a face in a mirror within Klein's apartment. It should be a big jump scare but because of the tone of the scene and the way it was shot, it's more of a weird surprise that only creeps you out if you're fast-forwarding through the film (which is how it got me all creeped out). The movie begins so smart and towards the end, we get yet another movie where the characters in the film have never seen or ready any story where ghosts, monsters or aliens are involved. Klein hears about a prophecy concerning a great tragedy on the Ohio River and like a fool basically runs around screaming, blabbering about doomsday and not even coming up with a clever story to explain why he is acting so weird.Despite the missteps along the way, it could have all been wrapped up neatly with a tight ending. One that doesn't explain too much, leaves enough to the imagination to play with your head and make you wonder if the mothman is still out there kind of thing. In a way, the film actually does have an ending like this that works really well and leaves itself ambiguous without feeling like it's a cop-out non-ending. It's a very creepy moment where Klein is waiting for a phone call. I couldn't make up my mind about what I wanted to see. Did I want him to do the smart thing and tear the phone from its wall, throw it in the trash can and run away with his fingers plugging his ears? Did I want him to answer the phone, regardless of the consequences? Unfortunately, that scene, the film keeps on going. We get a scene with a lot of cool special effects that goes on for way too long, doesn't belong at all in this movie and unfortunately features horrendous sound editing. You know those three stock screams you hear a lot in movies? We're talking about the Wilhelm scream, the Howie scream and that third overused one that only belongs in a movie if it's a joke. Yes, they are all present in the climax and it really hurts the film.Overall, The Mothman Prophecies isn't really that bad, it's just underwhelming. In the end it becomes another one of those spooky, supernatural movies that stayed pretty faithful to the truth except for a few glaring parts that were totally blown out of proportion to make a standard Hollywood story. It's a nice way to spend two hours though so as a rental or if it's playing on TV I recommend it, partially because what it does right it really does well and also because there's enough believable stuff going on here that if you watch it with someone else it will be a lot of fun to discuss.

The Mothman Prophecies is about a reporter that is drawn to a small West Virginia town to investigate a series of strange events, including psychic visions and the appearance of bizarre entities. The movie has a whole eerie feeling to it and one of the main reasons that makes it so eerie is because it is apparently based on actual events. I especially found the sub- plot of John and Mary Klein's relationship to be sad, an example of this is where Richard Gere's character, John Klein, said in the aftermath of his wife's death played by Debra Messing, Two weeks ago, we were house hunting. One day you're just driving along in your car, and the universe just points at you and says, Ah, there you are, a happy couple. I've been looking for you. I've been looking for you., I really found this to be an incredibly moving sentiment, does this mean that the universe has plans for us and that there is no hiding place from destiny no matter how happy we are? John Klein was looking for answers to why his wife had to leave him so early but he got more questions than answers, when Indrid Cold, said that, Mary Klein cannot be found by looking. You will see her in time. When The Mothman Prophecies was first released it received many negative reviews but I think those reviews are unfair as it is my opinion that The Mothman Prophecies is an incredible eerie moving horror movie that has never been surpassed or never will be.

But I would not consider it as a horror movie. Not per se at least. I must have watched this Gem of a movie at least some 20 times. I took quite a joy renting it over and over again in order to revisit it's eeriness and have a go at the Sound Track, until I bought a copy.

From the drawings in the hospital, to the eerie phone calls, and the unsettling music, this movie delivers, it is a real shame how underrated it is.I owe a lot to this story, not only did it introduce me to one of my favorite mysterious phenomenons The Mothman, but it also succeeded in leaving an impact on me. The very thought of encountering such an entity is terrifying to even think about, for over two months I was constantly looking behind my back in the dark, expecting big red eyes following me, or finding a demonic face looking at me in the mirror. They were not fun times.It's safe to say that 'The Mothman Prophecies' is an excellent psychological thriller, and it is worth checking out if you are in the mood for the unknown.

Where mysterious happenings and figments are truths. A seemingly happy life of John Klein (Richard Gere) collapses, when his wife Mary (Debra Messing) is diagnosed with a brain tumour. The event esoterically collides with an unexplained occurrence, where Mary sees a clouded moth figure encroaching her being. After Mary's death, John returns to his life as an investigative Washington Post journalist, until an unexplained episode has him transported into a small West Virginia town of Point Pleasant, where he is thrown back into the enigmatic universe of the Mothman.Partly presented as interviews, where figments of imagination and undecipherable from logic and hard reality, and filmed with a intrusive, engulfing vision, which shakes up the imagination and makes the mystery all the more cryptically enticing. Not so much a horror per se, although I honestly have seldom been as freaked out by the imagery offered by director Mark Pellington and cinematographer Fred Murphy. Instead it is a voyage into a possibility of other realities lurking behind what is subjective and scientifically conceived. Supposedly the Mothman is an entity from folklore, which has been witnessed amongst other in Point Pleasure, the epicentre of the strange phenomena. Obviously a fictionalised account it does go to great lengths to never overly explain any mystery within the movies, instead leaving most to imagination and ergo creating a lingering sense of otherworldly presence. Very successful in creating atmosphere the main storyline itself focused on John and his incapability of letting go, proved somewhat of a distraction from the more intriguing conversion of realities offered by the Mothman enigma.Cinematographically is absolutely brilliant in creating a unique mystery and invariably causes reluctant skin crawling sensations, thus providing a strong outlet for some remarkable scenes with the darkly lustrous entity. Seamlessly mixing in classical horror conventions with an inventive style The Mothman Prophecies is at worst a captivating experience, which does nonetheless overstay it welcome by offering a somewhat unneeded culmination, where a lingering mystery would be probably better serving. "},{"Title":"Indrid Cold Will Chill You","Date":"31 October 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Mystery","Review":" Laura Linney, one of Hollywood's preeminent mainstream actresses of the early 21st century, made a pair of highly effective horror pictures in 2002 and 2005 that share a number of notable similarities. The Mothman Prophecies, the earlier film, and The Exorcism of Emily Rose are both products of the Screen Gems/Lakeshore Entertainment production company, and both deal with supernatural events that are purportedly based on real-life incidents. Both films go far in convincing the viewer of the possibility of the bizarre happenings portrayed as being genuine and real (unknowable, highly advanced life forms watching over mankind in the first; demonic possession in the latter), and both, strangely enough, clock in at precisely 119 minutes. But whereas the exorcism film was based on a German case, transplanted here to midland America, Mothman retains its real-life setting and historical basis--the collapse of the Silver Bridge in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, on 12/15/67; a disaster that killed 46 people--but updates it to modern times.In the film, the viewer meets a Washington Post reporter named John Klein, whose life is shattered in the film's opening minutes when his wife (Debra Messing) dies following a freakish auto accident. Lying in the hospital, Mrs. Klein obsessively draws pictures of a strange, winged apparition that had appeared to her right before her crash. Two years later, the still-grieving Klein, while driving from D.C. to Richmond to cover a story, finds that he has somehow traveled over 400 miles in 90 minutes (!), and that he has somehow arrived at a small town called Point Pleasant, on the Ohio border. Once there, he and sheriff Connie Mills (as played by Laura Linney, probably the prettiest sheriff in screen history!) endeavor to get to the bottom of a bizarre series of happenings that have been plaguing the town of late. Sightings of a strange winged creature, voices coming out of a sink, warnings of world disasters that, oddly enough, DO come true...and a rather chilling entity that calls itself Indrid Cold all lead Klein to the shocking conviction that the legend of the Mothman may in fact be true. But why has he/it chosen to appear here and now? Based on the 1975 book The Mothman Prophecies by John Keel, the 2002 film is genuinely freaky, with any number of scenes guaranteed to raise goosebumps on the viewer. Among the film's eeriest scenes John speaks to Indrid Cold (an entity who should perhaps marry NYC Eyewitness News weather-gal hottie Amy Freeze!) on the telephone, and Cold manages to answer every question put to it regarding Klein's history; a Pt. Pleasant woman describes the Mothman's appearance at her window; Klein receives another phone call, possibly from his deceased wife. The film's bridge collapse sequence looks frighteningly realistic--don't know how director Mark Pellington managed to bring this disaster across, even WITH modern-day FX--and the performances turned in by the film's two leads are both first rate. The picture also features fine contributions from screen legend Alan Bates, as a professor who has written a book on the Mothman phenomena, and by Will Patton as the Pt. Pleasant citizen who is most directly affected by the Indrid Cold manifestations. Gere, it should be mentioned, really is terrific in the film, expertly displaying the full gamut of emotions, from happy husband to depressed widower, from confused reporter to a stunned believer in the otherworldly. (Not for nothing, but has anybody EVER seen Gere and Pink Floyd's Roger Waters in the same room at the same time? Or perhaps these two were separated at birth...or is it just me?) And he is well matched by Linney here; one of our finest actresses giving another pitch-perfect performance. Though the film apparently changes and condenses much from Keel's book, and, as mentioned, alters the facts surrounding the historic bridge disaster, it yet goes far in making its case that these Mothman beings might just exist (angellike?), watching over us and attempting to communicate. Still, their essential eeriness is hardly glossed over, in this extremely intriguing, beautifully shot and fairly creepy film. Recommended!

Mood and imagery is everything here, a weirdness gnaws away throughout, with the director showing a knack for simmering under the surface tension.

Being in another dimension of reality the Mothmen seem to know the future and in trying to prevent future disasters somehow get in contact with humans and try to warn them about them before they happen. It's Washington Post reporter John Klein, Richard Gere, who first comes across this strange phenomena after his wife Mary, Debra Messing, ended up in a car accident and later died in the hospital from a resulting brain tumor. It was Mary who saw this strange moth-like creature in her headlights that caused her to lose control and crash! What obviously this winged creature wanted was to get in touch with Mary's husband John who it had very important information to give him. This information came from the drawing that Mary drew at the hospital that were of strange moth-like creatures while she was under some kind of self imposed hypnosis. The sames ones she saw that cause her of lose control of her car that eventually ended up killing her. It's now two years later after Mary's death and John in driving to Richmond Virginia to interview the states governor makes an unscheduled U-turn and ends up on the other side of the state or across the border in Plesent Point West Virginia! Some 400 miles from where he was heading for!The film starts to get really spooky when John is confronted by Gordon Smallwood, Will Patton ,who swears that he's been trying to break into his and his wife's Denise's, Lucinda Jenney, home for the last three days. The fact that John never saw Gordon in his entire life and just went there once to use his phone when his car broke down made him think that he either was on drugs or had mistaken him or someone else. We soon find out that Gordon like both John and his late wife Mary were somehow contacted by these Mothmen that ended up driving the poor guy off the deep end. It's later when John tracked down in Chicago professor Alex Leek, Alen Bates, who in his writings seemed to have a handle on all this craziness in the Mothmen being able to get in contact with human beings and predict the future. Leeks for his efforts in warning the human race about all this ended up being committed into an insane asylum for 4 years as well as being driven from his top position in the collage that he was teaching in! It's there and and then that John, in what he had experienced, finally realized that all this Mothman revelations wasn't as crazy as they at first seemed to be. Especially after some of the predictions that the Mothmen told Gordon came shockingly true.***SPOILERS*** In the end all the loose ends of what the Mothmen tried to tell both Gordon, who had since frozen to death, and John started to somehow fit together. They were warning John that a major disaster was about to happen outside of Point Plesent at the Silver Bridge on the Ohio River that would end up killing scores of motorists that Christmas Eve! In desperation and with the help of Point Plesent Sheriff Connie Mills, Laura Linney, John works against the clock to keep that disaster,by closing down the bridge, from happening! What was soon to happen is that the Mothman's prediction did in fact come true! With John Connie and everyone else at Point Plesent totally helpless to prevent it!P.S The fact is that there was indeed a major deserter on the Silver Bridge on December 15,not Christmas Eve,1966 where 46 people-not 36 like in the movie-ended up being killed. But there's was no evidence that it was anything out of the ordinary or supernatural like the film tells us in the Mothmen, in predicting that it would happen, having anything to do with it!

Look at it. It's creepy!This is another horror/suspense movie that did surprise me. It's a contemporary retelling of John Keel's 1975 book of the same name, which itself was based on stories of sightings in Point Pleasant, West Virginia in 1966-67.I think the movie was quite well done. One thing that really struck me was the lack of computer-generated effects in many scenes; instead the clever use of camera effects... many times simply using a heavy blur on a silhouette... were very effective. The sound-scape throughout the movie was very convincing; director Mark Pellington added various sound bytes throughout the movie which only served to deepen the mystery... and creepiness... of the mothman. The acting I felt was very hit-and-miss... some actors did well, others did not, and that division applies to almost all the characters, including leads. The sub-plot based around the relationship of two lead characters was a pleasant surprise... it didn't affect the main storyline very much, at all, and yet played an important part; a very classy move from screenwriter Richard Hatem. Each character was allowed to develop on their own, to play their own parts, without sacrificing storyline in order to force romantic scenes.Overall, the film did a very good job of making me scratch my head, wondering what the heck is going on, who or what is this mothman? are these people sane or crazy? There is also a lot of detail in the movie that begs for re-watching... for example the times on clocks during certain events, odd reflections during normal scenes, barely audible sounds that when reviewed with more volume are quite thrilling.I give it 4 stars ('really liked it on Netflix and 7/10 on IMDb due to some shortcoming in tensity and a bit of poor acting. I believe the atmosphere of the movie could have been used a lot more effectively; it begged to be heavier much of the time.

I saw The Mothman Prophecies in the theatre and it made an impact. The basic storyline is loosely based on actual events, with a journalist finding himself in West Virginia where townspeople report seeing flying monsters and a mysterious figure named Indrid Cold. They bring prophecies of doom, and they take a personal tone for the protagonist when they seem connected to his dead wife.True, we don't really see the Mothman, which is a relatively well-known cryptid. That may disappoint some of the audience, but The Mothman Prophecies isn't a silly monster movie. It's meant to be a psychological thriller in which a creepy atmosphere is pervasive. There's much mystery and imagination in it. What really got me is the way this movie can open your mind to new possibilities; the Mothman is no flesh and blood creature, it's considered a force of nature compared to an electrical impulse or a microwave. Much of the focus is taken away from the Mothman itself (which would be difficult to depict convincingly) and directed at the prophetic Indrid Cold, but there's little doubt they're manifestations of the same force. This film made me want to believe in the Mothman, though the MonsterQuest episode seems to lean heavily towards the explanation that the cryptid is misidentified owls.The direction of the film is effective in creating the mysterious atmosphere and the writing and acting are solid. The Mothman Prophecies is an altogether good movie that needs more recognition.

He soon finds himself mysteriously translated to the town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia. He develops a relationship with the sympathetic but skeptical local police sergeant, played by Laura Linney. Klein soon discovers that many of the town's residents have sighted an eerie mothman-like entity, similar to the one his wife saw before she died. Deeper investigation causes Klein to have his own creepy encounters with the strange creature; he becomes convinced that the being (or beings) exists on a sphere far beyond humanity's finite comprehension and that it can predict impending calamities. In fact, he comes to realize that this mothman is trying to warn the small town of one. Can he decipher what specifically the tragedy will be and when it will occur? Can he save his life and his loved ones before it's too late?The Mothman Prophecies is not a monster movie or a slasher horror flick; it's a creepy supernatural/mystery story with loads of mood & atmosphere. Every element of this motion picture skillfully works -- acting, story, editing, score, cinematography, locations, effects, etc.Sensitive viewers will note an undeniable reverent, beautiful quality to the film. The ending is strangely touching.One critic claimed that the mysteries presented in the story are not supposed to be figured out and, indeed, CANNOT be figured out. This is completely untrue. One must understand that this film is brilliantly intricate. Many questions are raised with varying possible answers. Don't think for a second that there are no real answers in this film; they're all there, but you may have to watch it a few times to discover them. I appreciate the fact that the director and writer refused to spell everything out for the viewer, even allowing room for complete misinterpretation. If the viewer wants answers s/he must have ears to hear and be willing to work for them.My initial interpretation was that the mothmen are good spiritual beings that are trying to help humankind by predicting great calamities but can be easily misunderstood because they are so far superior to humans. In a nutshell my interpretation was that the mothman brought Gere to Point Pleasant to meet and save the future replacement for his dead wife, who died due to a pre-existing condition that only the mothman knew about. This explanation obviously suggests that the mothmen are good in nature.I've come to see that this interpretation is false; a brilliantly implemented red herring.*** SPOILER ALERT *** Don't read the following paragraphs unless you want to consider insights into the true nature of the mothmen The mothmen are in truth evil spirits, fallen angels or demons (they're synonymous). This is clear when viewing eye-witness drawings of the creatures; these pictures never show beautiful angel-like beings, but rather disturbing, obviously-malevolent winged-creatures.A mothman (evil spirit) CAUSED the auto accident that injured Debra Messing. Would a GOOD angelic being cause such a tragedy (regardless of the fact that she ultimately dies of a pre-existing problem)? The bible calls Satan the prince of the power of the air, hence, his underlings (demons) are spiritual and electro-magnetic in nature. They can thus easily manipulate a traffic light or speak through a phone that's not plugged in. They can even take human form, like the male nurse who insists Debra's drawings are of angels and then mysteriously vanishes, or mimic the voices of dead loved ones.The researcher from Chicago reveals that the mothmen are from hell (the spiritual underworld that underpins the earth) and send out mixed messages to ruin peoples lives. They may seem to be benevolently warning humans but, at the same time, are obvious instigators of human tragedies (the car crash, Gordon's job loss, insanity & ultimate demise and the researcher's loss of his family & a respectable social life, etc.). Also consider the fact that they refuse to reveal their true selves and intentions. They are highly skilled masqueraders.The reclusive researcher also points out that they have been around for a millennia and therefore see things at least 2 or 3 moves ahead of humans; they naturally use this vantage point to manipulate, deceive and destroy.At the end, the saved police woman, number 37 (research that number), is still a victim in that her previous views that the mothmen are evil and destructive could now flip-flop into the deception that the they are somehow agents of good. Of course we never find out if this happens because the tale potently ends with Gere and Linney in shock sitting in an ambulance just glad to be alive.The film powerfully illustrates that humanity is caught in a cosmic war and that there are beings whose sole purpose is to ruin or destroy us. Failure to understand and tactically prepare can be fatal. The only true protection from these evil spiritual beings is reconciliation with God through Jesus Christ's blood shield of atonement (not that the picture ever overtly reveals this, it's simply my addendum).*** END SPOILER ALERT *** Mothman is one of those rare films that you just put on to enjoy the cinematic magic, regardless of whether or not you know the ending or how many times you've seen it; it ranks up there with my all-time favorite movies.

The Mothman Prophecies is dark, which seems appropriate, but it chooses not so much to be a claustrophobic heavy thriller, but rather a more mystique one. The camera is very loose for most of the picture, with a lot of wide shots, most of them up high, some of them featuring a sweeping mobile frame. The movie also plays with camera focus, motion blur, and film grain for artistic and psychological effects. Without looking too stagy, the movie's style works.The Mothman Prophecies also relies on a compelling lead to drive the story. Richard Gene, though not a terrific actor is not a bad one either. He does a pretty good job in the movie, playing the role appropriately, without over doing or under doing it. Backing him up is Laura Linney, who is actually a better actor. Her role is much smaller and gives her less to work with, but she does it with total naturalism. I don't think I can say the same about Will Patton. He himself strikes me as a bit of an over actor, sometimes he is good, sometimes not. In the Mothman Propecies, there are times when he sounds like he is actually struggling to NOT raise his voice or exaggerate his posture.The Mothman Prophecies, is a thriller that requires a viewer's attention. this is not a dumb feature, and it's not a dull one either. I liked it for what it was, there is room for improvement, but it is certainly recommendable.

Although I am not a big fan of Richard Gere, this movie kept me glued to the seat. The premise, the music, cinematography, editing and acting are all spot on and serve well in ratcheting the mood of the film.The music, hands down, is one of the creepiest of this decade and is very well done. It borders on minimalism but it works on every level. Kudos to Tomandandy. Performances are first rate and Richard Gere does justice to his role and in the end you do feel his pain. Laura Linny, as always, perfect and Will Patton's entry in the movie will surely knock the wind out of the new-bees. It scared me, although I consider myself a veteran of horror genre.All in all, a great Friday night movie. Enjoy it with your girlfriend and see how she gets spooked next time she picks up the phone .

It is probably to be branded as a horror movie but it stands out from the others of its own genre. However, it is very unrealistic and thus except that it offers entertainment (human beings like being scared), to my understanding this movie is not going to teach you anything unlike the Exorcist which probably is closer to reality than the Mothman Prophecies is. If we do, however, assume that the movie is trying to tell us something, it is difficult to understand whether the message itself is substantial or not. I wonder if this title is going to yield anything but getting the audience scared! "},{"Title":"Best Picture of the year","Date":"28 July 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Mystery","Review":" It really is a shame that the Oscars mostly ignore horror films. There are a handful of exceptions (Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?, Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, Jaws, Silence of the Lambs) but generally they are shunned. Then a movie like The Mothman Prophecies comes along, and you wonder if a film is Oscar-worthy because of its most effective conveyance of its subject matter, its sheer execution, then Mothman should have at least been nominated for Best Picture. It conveys its subject matter (although it deviates greatly from the book) in a dead-on, unforgettable, hallucinatory way. I haven't seen another film that 'feels' like Mothman before or since. There's an absolute marriage of style and content to the film, and it demands that it be seen as its own beast, apart from the source material. There's the feeling of evil being 'within the very celluloid' of the film, a quote which comes from an overtly Catholic review of The Exorcist. Director Mark Pellington (Arlington Road) has created a tale for the ages; a relentlessly creepy look into the lives of a small group of people grappling with the unknown - and increasingly losing their grip on reality. Mothman has entered their lives, and their eyes have thus been opened to a truth about our world which defies explanation and belief. There is no line between reality and speculation in Mothman, and it's extremely disorienting and very, very scary. Richard Gere (American Gigolo, Chicago) gives an understated (and underrated) performance. Laura Linney (Tales of the City) gives a somewhat wooden performance, very controlled, but it works within the context of the film, as her character, the town sheriff, needs to remain rationally distant from the goings-on. Will Patton steals the whole movie, and his performance is so sensitive that you feel every painful nuance of his role. Lucinda Jenney is every inch the actor that Patton is, and their scenes together as beleaguered husband and wife are raw and exciting. Among the reasons that the film is so great is that it doesn't show too much of its 'monster'. It reminds me of Charles B. Pierce's The Legend of Boggy Creek, which, like Mothman, is really a thinking-man's monster movie, one that does not destroy its own mystery with heavy-handed special effects and dodgy, expository dialogue. Mothman raises more questions than it answers, and I think this is another one of its strengths. The atmosphere of the picture is absolutely chilling. Even casual daytime scenes, that are not big set-pieces, have a feeling of menace, and you find yourself looking for Mothman around every blustery corner. Tomandandy's musical score takes the subject matter to a whole other level. The music sounds so organic with the images that it's impossible and pointless to imagine it being any other way. That the film deviates from the book is my only qualm about the production. The book is actually creepier than the film, very different from it and much more detailed. It's a shame that the script couldn't have included more of the book, which involves UFO waves, Men in Black, and poltergeist activity, among other things. But the fact that the film works as well as it does justifies the means; the two stories stand separately. Both are powerful, provocative, chilling, and deserving of wide recognition.

Even though he has been driving for just under an hour and a half, the town is 600 miles off his intended course and he has no recollection of getting there. It is winter and the small town is moody, full of bare forest and bleak, overcast skies. The dark atmosphere only gets darker once Klein starts to meet the locals. I watched this with the lights out and by the middle I almost didn't want to turn them back on, for fear of what I'd see! It's true that the Mothman Prophecies embellishes the true story of the Mothman sightings in Point Pleasant, but I didn't find that to be a problem. By the ending, the film had tackled doppelgangers, Men in Black, UFOs, EVP, premonitions, as well as the elusive Mothman. With this three-ring circus of the paranormal going on, the film could easily have descended into cryptic farce, yet it manages to link the strange events together through Klein's gradual acceptance of his wife's death. Much like John Keel's book, the Mothman Prophecies movie doesn't try to deliver neat explanations for the mysteries of life. Instead, it uses them as a vehicle to tell the highly personal story of Klein's loss.My only criticism is that the film didn't delve deeply enough into the theories about Mothman's existence, so I sometimes felt like they were pushing the entity to the sidelines. It's a minor flaw in an otherwise beautiful and perceptive piece of cinema. "},{"Title":"compelling horror movie with an impressive cast","Date":"27 February 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Mystery","Review":" Critics have been pretty tough on this film&#151;only 50% on rottentomatoes.com&#151;but I've been very impressed both times I've watched it. My wife, however, was unable to appreciate it, because it's so creepy (and for her depressing). It's not often that a horror movie has such an impressive cast Richard Gere as John Klein, Laura Linney as Connie Mills, Will Patton as Gordon Smallwood, et al. All of the main actors are outstanding. It's not easy to describe the story (based on true events), and maybe that turned off some critics. But for me, it's an extremely compelling story of supernatural events that can't be explained in conventional terms. We are introduced to John Klein, star reporter for the Washington Post, and his wife Mary. They are obviously happy and very much in love. They've just purchased a large, luxurious house. Everything seems to be perfect. Then something strange, and inexplicable happens. Mary is driving back from viewing the home when something appears&#151;to her&#151;out of nowhere. Is it a giant moth? She loses control of the car and suffers brain trauma. Tests reveal a tumor that proves to be fatal. Before she dies, she asks John, Did you see it? He finds sketches she made of a figure that looks like a man with moth wings, or could it be the Devil? Two years later, John is still grieving. Something compels him to drive toward Virginia in the middle of the night. His car breaks down in a small town called Point Pleasant. When he knocks on the door of a nearby house, an apparently deranged man (Gordon) threatens him with a shotgun. Sheriff Connie Mills explains that there have been many strange events recently. She shows him a sketch someone made that's identical to the ones his wife made. John soon discovers that a mysterious entity (Mothman AKA Indrid Cold) is predicting disasters, and is communicating via vague (and scary) messages with Gordon, John, and Connie. These are the prophecies referred to in the title. None of this would work if not for the strong performances mentioned above. I'm not much of a Gere fan, but this is one of his best roles. We can relate to the passionate grief, and lingering love that he feels for the love he lost. This is also the role of a lifetime for Patton, who is introduced as a psychopathic bully but develops into a sensitive, vulnerable soul. And Linney has never been better than she is here, as the sexy cop with a warm heart. The improbable romantic relationship that develops between her and John is handled perfectly, so it doesn't feel forced or contrived. The Mothman Prophecies is one of my favorite movies in this genre. For those who don't require that all the plot threads to be tied neatly together with a bow, this is delightfully scary&#151;and thought-provoking&#151;experience.

Local cop Connie Mills arrives to calm the situation, Klein is staggered to hear the man's version of the story, that claims that he has called for the third night in a row. Released from his captor, he befriends the cop and is staggered yet again to find that his car is in perfect working order and that he is hundreds of miles off course from his intended destination. Mills regales him with some other strange events that have been occurring in the area, people with strange burns and sightings of a mysterious 8ft tall Mothman. Klein intrigued abandons his political case and stays to investigate further. After my first viewing of this I was amazed to hear it was based on true events, but sure enough it is, there's even an interesting documentary on the DVD that interviews all the real people involved. The film gathers many of the confusing stories and moulds them into a cohesive believable and at times rather terrifying film. Klein's investigations turns up a few possible explanations for the Mothman without ever coming down on the side of any one, Mothman prophecies is a classic conspiracy film except there's no politics involved here, well maybe not? There's also a plot line of Klein's wife turning up and some mysterious phone calls to up the ante in the suspense department.

In her last days, Mary draws some bizarre pictures of a baffling winged creature. Two years pass and while Klein is driving to meet the governor of Virginia when his car breaks down, he seeks help from a local, Gordon Smallwood (Will Patton) who accuses Klein of stalking him. If that is not inexplicable enough, Klein soon finds that somehow he drove in complete opposite direction and covered 400 miles in 90 minutes to reach Point Pleasant, in West Virginia. He comes across Sergeant Connie Parker (Laura Linney) who tells him that in the past few weeks, the locals have been filing sighting reports of a winged creature. Curiosity gets the better of Klein and he decides to investigate further since the locals' description of the creature matches his wife's drawings. As the story unfolds, he seeks the help of a paranormal expert Alexander Leek (Alan Bates) to ascertain if this creature, 'Mothman,' wants to tell him and the residents something.The movie is based on a book that narrates true paranormal events that rocked Point Pleasant in 1966. The director has taken the facts to spin a chilling tale and you would want to see it again to understand the mechanics of the movie better. The horror/sci-fi fans should watch it for intense performances by Gere and Linney. The movie would not disappoint you either.

Everything is a-okay in the sound and visual department, but those who've seen Arlington Road already know that Pellington has got skills.I detracted many points for Gere's wooden acting but the film itself is good. There is good suspense build-up and the story certainly manages to intrigue. A major factor of the intrigue here is probably the fact that it is 'based on true events'.This movie it's not a masterpiece but if the mothman really manages to grab you under his spell and if the movie really gets under your skin, it's thoroughly enjoyable.

The use of color on some scenes, some of the camera work, the story and sound effects were very good. It wasn't cheesy where we would actually see what they look like.

Keel's famous UFO story and what a wonderful and rich role for Gere who should maybe experiment more in movies that deal with the realms of the unknown! Also the director, Mark Pellington, is very good and deserves more projects like this one.A much respected reporter for the 'Washington Post' - John Klein (Richard Gere) is about to have his life turned upside down when his wife dies in an automobile accident that seems to have been caused by a mysterious flying creature which he never did see himself. The plot takes Gere to the Ohio/West Virginia border where he meets with the local residents who all seem to be having their troubles with strange lights, weird phone calls and a bird like creature which they call the Mothman. Klein investigates the mystery at the cost of his own sanity and career.The film is very scary but lacks the pace and fiber that made the John A. Keel's book an awe inspiring read. There are no Men In Black, UFO's, alien impregnated women, phone tapings or a clear resolution to some of the character's fate. In fact only about 10% of the book is actually reproduced in the film. The other 90% seems to have been plucked from an episode of the 'X-files'... but what a good episode it is! This is a film that has high production values. The lighting, camera-work, sound and editing are always on top form which is something that prevents the movie from disappearing into the ranks of science fiction B-movie hokum. 'The Mothman Prophecies' looks simply 'weirdly' gorgeous.There is not enough Mothman revealed to the viewer but country folk Gordon Smallwood (the well cast and superbly acted Will Patton) creates a much needed conduit into the effects that the Mothman has on the people of Point Pleasant and this is what the film is really all about - The consequences that the supernatural can have on the psyche of a small backward town's population. Although the ending is Mothman free it certainly does jolt the emotions and evokes a sort of belittling sympathy for the human beings of this planet.Watch this film and then go read the book for a much better look at really went on.

The movie got off to too slow of a start. Always the kiss of death. But, you know I have no clever fix for that except tighten the hell out of the first sequence & maybe use the gained time to fix flaw #2 the poor character development of Mothman. For the monster in a basically monster movie (especially a rather intellectual, spiritual & mysteriously motivated monster) his character development is sadly neglected. The only credit for Mothman is his voice, the director Mark Pellington, who had a speaking role only & a bit part as the bartender. Big, Big, Big mistake.'The Creature From The Black Lagoon', had a real person (2 of them)in a rubber suit & they brought a special something that a special effects monster could never match. Same with the original version of 'The Thing'. This is a special effects only monster (done with voice-over) & it shows. 'Hello it's long distance calling & guess what it's me the monster again.' If they only had enough sense to put a decent actor in a Mothman suit & run with it they could have developed as chilling a monster as Hannibal the Cannibal in 'Silence of the Lambs'. But no, they had to squander the whole special effects budget on the bridge collapse. I read in the trivia about several times we are allowed to glimpse the Mothman but you know half of those were too short & poorly inserted/shot to read visually & I missed most of them. Overall the movie is not bad but not really good either. Not as good as it could have been.I'm going to have to read the book. I have seen the Mothman in other tales of the unknown, usually under Alien Animals, he's something of a standard article. The time & space juggling stuff could have been handled better; this is what leads to the complaints of the movie being confusing. They are a variation on the flashback & flashforward idea & those techniques are always risky business at best.I have one little nugget to share about the hints that the monster is somehow above & beyond our ken. There is a book called 'Flatland A Romance of Many Dimensions' by the mathematician, Edwin A. Abbot. But what has this to do with Mothman? And well you might ask. Well, in a nutshell the book is about what happens when a being that lives in a higher dimension than you & me attempts to communicate with us. What the deal would be is that Mothman lives fully in the fourth dimension (time) whereas we live fully in only the three familiar dimensions & only get a distorted & imperfect view of the fourth. The book is not at all stodgy or intimidating. It's also short & cheap. I highly recommend it.One final thought. I think Mothman would be an outsider among his own kind. Somehow driven to observe & interfere/help in our existence while the rest of his kind could really give a damn. Maybe it's his hobby.

Key scenes just lay there in front of your eyes with little excitement.  The characters in the movie don't connect with one another very well.Another problem is the choice of Richard Gere as the lead character, a newspaper reporter mysteriously transported to Point Pleasant during an evening drive from Washington to Richmond.  In order for the viewer to connect and experience the terror and anxiety the person on the screen is supposedly feeling, they have to relate to that character.  You want to say, hey, this is happening to me.Richard Gere is too urbane and detached an actor to play this type of role.  The X Files works because David Duchovny is more a regular guy, an everyman.  Richard Gere is a fine actor but he's Hollywood thru and thru.Will Patton is the only one who provides a window into what the people of Point Pleasant must have been experiencing back then.

Yes. Does it stand up to close scrutiny? Probably not. This is one of those movies that, like 'The Sixth Sense', you wished you had been able to watch more carefully and with greater understanding so that you could spot the clues and work it out just before all is revealed. Of course, there are always plenty of smart alecs who claim always to 'get it' at the first clue, or others who linger over plot holes that they claim undermine the film's credibility, and certainly, 'Mothman Prophecies' does not have a twist that can't be guessed, and it does have chasms in the storyline. Yet I was kept watching by the simple device of wanting to know what was going to happen in the end. Now I know, I want to check whether there were sufficient visual clues to have been able to get there before Richard Gere does. There were plenty...so many variations on wing shapes, reflections, criss-cross patterns and coloured lights, that, given a five minute break before the denouement, I think that it could be done...did any other reader guess the exact nature of the climax?The film's tagline, and the director's persistent visual style (intriguing or just plain irritating?) invites the viewer to make sense of the blurred pictures, like the famous blotch tests used in psychology (is it an old woman or a can-can dancer, an urn or two faces nose-to-nose?). The trouble is, if you don't play the game to begin with, you're unlikely to want to play afterwards. 'The Mothman Prophecies' has just enough to keep you going once, but no more. Whether you get to the end may well depend on how much you like Richard Gere, Twilight Zone (there long before The X Files) mysteries, and can 'stop the show' (hardly a William Castle fright break needed here!) to check what you've got, a luxury available on video/DVD but not to those who may have been disappointed in the cinema.

Some of the shots are just fantastic (the camera inverting as it passes the telegraph pole in the field, the zoom into the picture of Mary, the use of filters in flashback, etc). This is one of the best looking films around without a doubt.The film is also strong story-wise. It's extremely intriguing and the parts are very well-acted. The only downside is that I think the story goes a bit off-the-rails for a while when Klein leaves Point Pleasant to visit Leek. It doesn't last too long though. I can see why some people might think it was boring, but I didn't personally. This is one of those movies that requires your undivided attention if you are to get anything out of it.2 scenes are particularly memorable- Gordon's encounter with Indrid Cold at the chemical plant (great tension) and the telephone conversation between Klein and Cold.

And that plays against it, because of this problem it's not as half as gripping as some similar movies like The Others or Sixth Sense which catch you from the start and don't let you stand up even for going to the bathroom till the end, a situation that unfortunately doesn't happen in this movie (except for some scenes, which I won't tell you here).

Infilms such as Cure and Pulse, ordinary people are confrontedwith enigmatic, strange, and usually deadly forces beyond theircontrol.  To Kurosawa's credit, these strange events are never fullyexplained, keeping the audience unsettled and in suspense.In The Mothman Prophecies, a similar effect is achieved, andlargely upheld throughout the film.  In the tradition of The Exorcist,The Shining and other good examples of atmospheric horror,strange events are parlayed and witnessed by a helplessprotagonist (played listlessly by Richard Gere).  The buildup oftension and the unexplained is intense, and the filmmakers do agood job of keeping you on the edge of your seat.However, like Richard Gere's character, we too wish to find out thesecret behind the enigma.  In films like The Exorcist and evenKurosawa's Cure, the nature of the beast, or supernaturalmenace, is subtly explained through either exposition, or a fewpivotal scenes.  Unfortunately, this is where Mothman fails todeliver.There is a need, or a desire to learn more.  However, in the film'sthird act (or lack thereof), a good chance to sum up events, or atleast bring some narrative closure to the proceedings, is avoided. Instead, the filmmakers opt for a lavish disaster scene straight outof a Hollywood disaster movie, and top it up with a Hollywoodending.  Not only is this completely out of place, but, as Imentioned, it skirts the real issues at hand.  Who is the Mothmanor Mothmen?  Is there a greater significance to their existance?We will never know.  Personally, I didn't care after the end creditsbegan to roll - I felt cheated out of a decent third act.Still, as a curiosity piece, The Mothman does have its moments.

That said, The Mothman Prophecies was the absolute most frightening experience I have ever had.  Keep your Blair Witch, keep all of your M. Night Shyamalan films; this is it.I like the new trend of not emphasizing the creature or the monster and letting folks use their own imaginations - in fact, one of the reasons I didn't give Signs a higher score is that they DID have a confrontation with the alien.  Although there are glimpses of the something everyone refers to in The Mothman Prophecies, there certainly isn't undue focus placed on it.  Therefore, instead of dwelling on the sight of it, you're free to react along with Richard Gere's John Klein when he double-takes the time on his watch.  Imagination is the key to this film, and if you have an open mind and a very relaxing atmosphere to watch it in, you may very well find yourself holding your hand over your mouth tightly for fear of releasing the gorge that has risen at the back of your throat.Whether or not the film stayed true to the actual events that occurred matters little.  Although a selling point for many may be that this was in fact a true story, even at complete fiction this would be a harrowing story. I began watching with my customary disdainful attitude, and by about the 45 minute mark was absolutely astounded at my mental, emotional, and physical reaction to it. Watch with an open mind and enjoy.

(But where are the men in black?  They were sighted along with the mothmen during the real events.)Taken as a serious thriller it falls far short, not enough is explained or made clear.  The most conventional part of the story is Richard Gere mourning his dead wife, and both gradually developing affection for Laura Linney (who is making a name for herself as a serious character actress) and realizing that she may also be facing a death that this time can be avoided.  Most of the rest is buried in layers of nuances and intrigue, which would probably take several viewings to figure it all out.  I don't for a moment believe the film makers were geniuses who told a fantastic tale, if anything they were trying too hard to create an atmosphere.  However, there are some interesting ideas about how we base our realities on what we remember or what we believe, and that keeps the interest going even if the mothmen are never described as much more than shadowy spirits who like to show up around disaster time and tell cryptic foreboding about it.  I really would like to have known if the mothmen were true supernatural creatures or, as the writer says in one scene, beings simply able to see farther than we can.  Why do they care so much about disasters anyway? In the hands of a great director like Kurosawa or Kubrick this alternate reality dreamland the mothmen come from could have been very deep and powerful, instead we get more questions than answers.

Richard Gere is not my favorite, but I think he did a good job in the part of a scared guy without making it too hokey. I didn't feel this movie had any real conclusion, and being that it is a movie and not simply a documentary, it seemed to deserve one, even if it were only a written epilogue about the after effects in the town. Overall I would give this movie a B, worth a rental, but overall I didn't feel it was fantastic.

I had read the John Keel book years ago and knew this film was based on the book so it would take what liberties it needed to to tell a good story.I read here over and over again that a complaint is that the viewers never got to see the boogieman. I am perhaps old-fashioned in that I believe that less is more as far as horror movies go. My imagination is quite active enough to fill in the gaps if you give me enough clues to go by. This film provides amble glimpses and clues as to the nature of the mothman, I didn't need a lingering camera shot, I didn't need to count it's scales or feathers to know that it was scary enough in the little glances we got in the movie. But I do understand that some need their imagination spoon-fed.All in all, a good movie. Filled with twists and confusion just as I am sure thae characters were in the story. It is not a story that is laid out in a very formulaic manner, you might have to think a bit to get this one. But if you are willing to sit with it, give your self over to it and go for the ride, it is very enjoyable and has a whole lot more to say than just scaring us.

In the end I am glad that I did watch it, because behind the spooky veneer of the Moth Man mythology there is definately deeper meaning to this story. It's quite easy to mistake some of the characters (including Gere's wife in the film) as ultimately inconsequential but each of these characters do indeed have an involvement with the plot.While the Moth Man plot is rich and somewhat open ended, it relaxes towards the end of the film, and Gere's struggle to let go of his past anguish in favour of ensuring his future becomes the main focus of the film. In essence, it is impossible to understand an enigma such as the Moth Man, but if we take this simple theory and apply it to every character involved in the film, or every person who has ever received insight into disasters of the future, I think you'll find that it isn't far wrong.Of course we only see what we want to see. This is true of both us as the audience, and any person receiving such precognition, but I suggest you give this film some of your own time and I'm sure you'll garner more than just a spooky evening of entertainment.

(aka the Son of Lost Highway)","Date":"12 December 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Mystery","Review":"  I knew next to nothing about the Mothman case until fairly recently, and I was lucky to be able to read the book by John Keel before seeing the film. To be honest, I wasn't expecting much...the book is fatally disjointed, rambling, scientifically inaccurate (my favourite bit is where Keel sneers at the idea of there being planets around other stars), and...well...it seemed very strange to me that UFOs could buzz this town for months on end, as Keel makes clear, without anyone taking photographs of, or filming, a single one.  Keel's other writings on flying saucers are, to put it mildly, X Files nonsense...tales of secret alien bases in Nevada, a war between Uncle Sam and the Greys etc etc.  But, from the other books I have read, it was clear that *something* very strange had happened in Point Pleasant West Va. in 1966/7, so I decided to give the film a go. And...well, it's a mixed bag.  The Mothman Prophecies plays like David Lynch on an off day ie it has the concentrated, almost autistic strangeness of a Lynch movie but it lacks the coherent inner logic that even the strangest Lynchian moment possesses There are many shots on the movie that are in fact clearly ripped off Lynch's Lost Highway.  What we get is ambiguity in spades, lots of very artsy direction, and a story that starts out telling us nothing and ends up telling us...not a great deal more.This is the problem, you see - the film is based on 'true events', but you can't come straight out and say 'alien moth people turned up in this town and warned folks about a coming disaster' because you CAN'T BACK THAT UP. So, the director is forced to show us lots of strange things taking place without giving us any clear idea as to what is going on.   With that said, the story delivers more information than some viewers might think and have claimed here...but again, said info is all so hazy and snowed under by flash cuts, wobbling Se7en-esque superimpositions and Metal Machine Music sound dubs that the point gets lost.  One feels fuzzy-headed after seeing this flick, for sure.Richard Gere, who for some reason reminded me of Harrison Ford in this film, underplays the central role of John Klein (Keel) to good effect.  The sort of movies he's known for tend to inspire little but contempt in me, so it was good to see him tackle a new genre.  Will Patton is excellent as the tormented contactee Gordon, while Laura Linney is...flat as the sympathetic town cop.  The film can never decide whether it's a tale of lost love and emotional redemption or a flat psych-horror, with the result that the intended emotional weight is either submerged or knocked out of the frame completely.We never see the Mothman.  So?  We never saw the Blair Witch either.  What you don't see is far scarier than what you do...an elementary lesson that Robert Wise learnt in The Haunting but has passed most directors since him by.  It would have been nice to see even a small glimpse of the creature, sure, but given that no-one (not us, not the cast) ever find out what really happened, the lack of an 'enemy' is actually quite fitting.  One's mind fills in the blanks for something that would always have been grosly disappointing had it been shown, I think.  For my part, the scene where enitity Indrid Cold talks to Klein on his hotel phone (the scene was stolen wholesale from Lost Highway as well, btw) is far scarier than a barnful of slavering mothmen onscreen.Where were the UFOs that were so prominently featured in the book? Well, you can watch a deleted scene on the DVD where the cast look at some lights in the sky we are never shown, but other than that, sorry folks.  So, mothmen are OK to talk about in this movie, but not flying saucers?!  Perhaps the director was afraid if he explored the UFO angle, people would dismiss the film as a Scully and Doggett rip-off.  Too late!Ah, but strangely absent factors are so typical of this movie...the director has nothing to show us but smoke and mirrors.  Pellington has talent, and not a small amount of it, but classy photography and sheer chutzpah can't carry a story with so little flesh to it.One extra point for the dramatic and very well directed disaster scene at the end...I won't spoil it, but that part was very VERY well done.  In fact, the whole film is beautifully made...but like an Easter egg, there's nothing under the shell.  Still, I liked it.So, if you dug Arlington Road, see this movie.  If you love films that are all style and no substance, see this movie. If you liked Lost Highway, you've *already seen* this movie.One point *off* for the making of featurettes on the DVD, in which the director pontificates with truly breathtaking pretentiousness about all manner of things, some of which are to do with the movie.  You'd think he could have at least shaved for the opening scene, for the love of Mike.

Richard Gere is always good value on the screen and I certainly enjoyed the eerie/spooky atmosphere created by the director.However the story does seem a bit all over the place. The Mothman whom the film is named after never actually makes an appearence, just lots of stories and flashing lights, I think they could have shown him to us at least once even if it was only a fleeting glance. The characters seem to chase their tails most of the time totally confused and the audience right along with them. Also the film seems a bit artsy to me, relying more on atmosphere than substance and trying to scare you with dark shadows and spooky scenes rather than anything you can actually see or feel. This is ok for a while but ends up leaving with an empty feeling that the film was about nothing at all.Overall I found the film enjoyable to watch but it failed to live up to what I had hoped for.

Director Mark Pellington makes the film compelling, retaining a stylish and spooky atmosphere throughout, but viewers are left wondering why director he only used the Mothman creature as an impetus for the story, abandoning him/it for the second half.  Still, it wasn't like I wanted to leave the theater in disgust&#133; When his wife Mary (played wonderfully by Debra Messing &#150; let's get her some more Hollywood roles) is unexpectedly killed in a strange, flukey car-accident, John Klein (Richard Gere), a respected Washington Post journalist (instigated by his wife's eerie sketchpad), examines the mysterious circumstances surrounding her death, becoming entangled in a strange phenomenon four hundred miles away in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, where all sorts of weird things have happened.  Once there, he rolls up his sleeves, and digs right in (where we, the viewers, are given no impression of time)!  Crypto-zoologists will dig this, as it examines the myth of the infamous Mothman, a friend of El Chupacabra and Sasquatch, but Pellington shrouds its `tangible' existence in too much mystery, which only helps confuse the viewer.  For example, why does the Mothman (also known as Ingrid Cold for no apparent reason) have so many different forms and voices?  What's the point?  The creature needs only be psychic to turn in a good plot!  Then the film concludes as a disaster flick with Klein at the heart of a dramatic rescue, further confusing the motivation of the movie -- Pellington can't decide if this is The Poseidon Adventure or The Legend of Boggy Creek!  Still, his bridge catastrophe might rank up there behind director Andrew Davis' train-wreck sequence in The Fugitive!Despite its cohesiveness, I still liked this film.  It was a good role for Gere, and both Messing and Laura Linney (playing Connie Parker, a local cop) were amazing!  Unlike most overly made-up heroines in film, these two seemed real to me (perhaps its their freshness and lack of high-profile film roles).  And director Pellington, the man behind Arlington Road, should have a long, interesting career based soley on his camera-work!

This is why the first seasons of 'X-Files' were better then the coming ones, and the more we knew about the causes of the troubles of agents Mulder and Scully, the most thin the veil of magic was. The directors of this film understood well these basic rules.

But the end result, unfortunately, adds up to not much in the scare department.At first the film's carefully calibrated atmosphere of unease works in its favor.  We're drawn into the Twilight Zone-ish predicament of Washington Post reporter Gere, who, having lost his beloved wife in a mystifying car accident depicted in the prologue, embarks on a road trip to Richmond, Virginia late one night.  When his car breaks down, he finds himself stranded and disoriented in a small West Virginia town, having traveled an impossible distance in not only the wrong direction, but in far too short a time.  It gets worse when he knocks at a local farmhouse and finds himself at the wrong end of a shotgun wielded by an enraged Will Patton, who insists that Gere has been harassing him and his family for three nights running(!).With the help of sympathetic local constable Linney, Gere gradually begins to piece together the odd happenings, which revolve around tantalizing references to, and incremental glimpses of, the title entity.  Apparently the Mothman is some kind of otherworldly harbinger of disaster, and his/its appearance portends death and doom.But this intriguing premise remains muddled and illogical.  Gere tracks down reclusive paranormal author Alan Bates, but he's not much help in explaining just what the hell it is that's going on.  After more vague supernatural occurrences, including an eerie phone conversation with an apparently inhuman, omniscient being (The Mothman?  Or one of many Mothmen?  We never really know.), the story climaxes with an impressive special effects sequence that is exciting to watch but not particularly frightening.I could live with the Mothman -- or Mothmen -- being left somewhat ambiguous as to what their true nature is.  But for a horror film, the lack of confrontation with the title creature and the fact that we never see the damn thing even though its salient insectoid/non-human form is what inspires dread in the first place, is ultimately a cheat and a disappointment.  As Stephen King has said, in true horror you can build up suspense all you want, but sooner or later you have to show the Bear.  Or in this case, the Moth would have sufficed.

But after seeing it, I wish I had saved my rental money for a movie that actually had a coherent plot and some real actors. I am totally stunned that this movie has such good reviews! Seriously, the plot was so weak as to be nearly nonexistant -- John Klein, who lost his wife 2 years earlier to a brain tumor after a car accident, finds himself in a strange town and hears several similar accounts about a mothlike creature with glowing red eyes that seems to appear right before bad things happen. Coincidentally, his late wife also saw this creature before her fatal accident -- surely there must be a tie here? (There is not, except that the Mothman appeared before something bad happened.) All this sounded like the beginnings of a great plot, but unfortunately, that's as far as it ever went. The viewer is left with all sorts of unanswered questions at the end of the movie, the main one being What the hell was THAT all about? For example <possible spoiler ahead>, what's with the scene when Klein first goes to a home for help and is told by the residents that he was there three nights in a row? That was one huge string that was left to hang in space! As for the acting, well, Richard Gere has never shown much talent. In every one of his movies I've seen, he is all eye candy, no substance, and this flick is no exception.All in all, don't waste your money on this one. There are lots of good horror movies out there.

No, we can't explain it--and I applaud director Mark Pennington for not insulting my intelligence by coming up with some contrived, slick Hollwood ending all wrapped up neatly in Christmas paper.Richard Gere is, for once, not over-the-top or melodramatic in his role as Washington Post reporter John Klein, who's about to take the out-of-the-way ride of his life. Alan Bates as Alexander Leek is utterly believable as a man who's been to the edge and peeked over, then decided to run as far as he can from what he saw there.Debra Messing is good as Mary, the wife John loses and who may be trying to reach him again (or not.)Will Patton is the tortured individual who is seeing, or not seeing, Something. And hearing whatever it is in his bathroom drain. And becoming a sort of transmitter for whatever it is. And...well, let's just say his life doesn't get any simpler as his visitations grow more intense.Laura Linney's Connie Mills, apparently the only police officer on duty in Point Pleasant, W. Va., is enigmatic at times. She starts out wanting to believe that something way out of the ordinary is happening in her hometown. Later she backs away somewhat, seemingly unwilling to accept what she sees going on, and what Klein is telling her. Later yet we hear her call him in his Georgetown apartment (or is she really calling him?) and is the warm, concerned female friend who wants to save Klein from--what? Madness? Solitude? The Mothman?All through the film, cinematography, editing, and special effects--not to mention tight writing--give us a story that creeps up and spreads its dark wings over us in the night. A particularly electric moment occurs in Klein's motel room, as his image in a mirror is just a bit out of synch with the man himself, as if it had a life of its own. A moment later, we wonder if it did...Don't see this film if you want exploding cars and exposed cleavage. Stay away if you want everything all tidy and spelled out by the time end credits roll. Do rent it, however, if you seek a thriller that believes in your ability to envision the unimaginable.

David Eigenberg was very good in it as the CRAZY man who placed a shotgun to Richard Gere in one scene.  This movie left me scratching my head as to what the heck the MOTHMAN was all about.  David Eigenberg claimed to have MET Him.  As it turns out, the person that he claimed to have met was named Ingrid Cold.  INGRID COLD is the musician that wrote the theme song to this movie!  I caught that in the credits.  Richard Gere plays a journalist who is driving along one night with his wife.  His wife sees a moth and hits it.  That's when she gets a TUMOR and eventually dies.  Then Richard Gere loses 5 or so hours of time and ends up near OHIO.  That's where he meets David Eigenberg.  He spends lots of time trying to figure out who the MOTHMAN is.  He in fact, becomes OBSESSED with it.  It was very strange and left many questions unanswered for me.  The COP is this movie was very cute.  Good thing she never hooked up with either David Eigenberg or Richard Gere, that would have RUINED the movie.  I am glad I rented this.  Had I seen it at the THEATER, I would have been let down.

Its taken him quite a few attempts but he has finally made it.The Mothman Prophecies, for me was a film with imagination and ambition. I would refute the 'X-Files on Prozac' accusations and say that it rises above anything the X-Files has done in years.I think a good movie has to be inventive. I dont particularly like 'point a to point b to arrive at conclusion c' films, or dull clinical editing. This was a heavily stylised film and, i believe all the better for it. The lights forming the shape of a moth, red lights tricking us to think of menacing eyes and the clever use of sound and jump edits to keep us on (or above!) the edge of our seat (the part where Gere is talking on the phone and his reflection in the mirror was a split second ahead comes to mind).The exposition of the Mothman as a sentient being was well handled, as well as keeping the humanoid version blurred and mysterious. Not being familiar with the source text I couldn't comment on how well the Indrid cold translated, but for me it was pretty good.All in all, the story rattled along at a decent pace and Gere gave a good performance as a man who is always one step behind (If it had been me i would have probably been committed ;-)). I would highly recommend The Mothman Prophecies to anyone who likes a bit of a thriller and appreciates a break from the norm. The only thing I would have liked is a bit of a conclusion on the 'Mothmen', but as I have said before, I'm a sucker for a back-story.**** out of ***** (Well done Richie!

This film was subtle, intense, and very scary. Loosely based on actual events recounted in the book of the same name by John Keel, the film introduces us to the folklore of the mothman, a mysterious spirit-man-creature that is purported to visit us before we are to die a tragic death.  John Klein, a Washington Post reporter, is gradually drawn into the world of the mothman, following his wife who has died two years earlier tragically and mysteriously.  The set of Point Pleasant, Ohio - very appropriately named - where he is drawn is an isolated, almost otherworldly town in West Virginia we are used to finding in the likes of Stephen King classics. One by one, characters in the film give in to the advances of a mysterious presence, and in doing so, unwittingly seal their own doom.  Only John Klein, apparently, has the power of self to resist. But we don't learn all these intense details until the VERY end, so this film leaves you reeling with thought if you didn't read the book (as I didn't).  The cinematography and music is masterful, haunting, and thought inspiring.  Very well done creepy visuals and sets, including phone calls from beyond, lost time (not knowing where you are or how you got there), and dream-like meetings with the mothman who seems demonic in habilment. The audience is left to interpret many of the mythical details of the monthman themselves, which I think is the mark of the greatest of suspense thrillers.  What I though was most original and scary was the notion that if you meet the mothman, your doom is sealed.  We are on edge when John Klein is about to pick up the phone and be reunited with his dead wife, but his better judgement prevents his from doing so.  By rebuking his dead wife, we know John Klein saved himself from his own tragic fate.  A very original idea - the conscious choice to save yourself from fate.  Through the chilling accounts of the mothman prophesy, we gain a thoughtful perspective on our own life and death.  A classic.

This is the first movie in quite some time that has genuinely creeped me out to the point where I actually turned the lights OFF so that I could revel in that all-too-seldom experience. I did not find it slow, or overly-long, or boring in any respect. And I'm not even claiming ownership of a wider than average attention span. My honest opinion as to why so many people seem to have been turned off by this movie is the fact that at some undiscernible point in the movie, it stops being a horror movie and starts becoming something else. A bold move, in my opinion, which unfortunately seems to have alienated the movie-going throngs hungry for your typical violent, bloody, lame climax. The Mothman Prophecies is a movie that should satisfy anyone with an imagination who longs for the days when scary movies were actually scary, and should rightfully displease those whose idea of a good scare is only equivalent to the splatter-content therein.

She dozed on and off, while I sat there waiting for the scary part to arrive.  It never came.     What I surmised by the end of the film was that the Mothman merely prophecies death, not causes it.  The wife already had her brain tumor; she could just as easily have died without seeing the moth through the windshield.  Planes crash and bridges collapse routinely, and all the Mothman did was let someone know.  In fact, he could be looked upon kindly because he saved Connie's life, having tipped off John Klein that there would be a disaster on the river.  Even Gordon died benignly, sitting peacefully against a tree.  He was a former drinker...maybe his liver gave out.     So what you have is a movie with a lot of window dressing phones ringing in the night, cars going dead on the road, sketches of black moths in notebooks, Richard Gere shaking his head in puzzlement.  And yet no real suspense and no reason, at least that I can see, for making the movie except that it was supposedly based on a true story.  There are lots of true stories out there that don't merit being made into films.   I'm a real fraidy-cat, and this movie made me yawn.  But it you're a Richard Gere fan, you might appreciate that his silver hair is dyed in this movie and he looks quite a bit younger than in real life.

Attempting to actually tell the story of this movie would be nothing but a waste of time. It will take you to the far edges of reality and twist you so you will not even know if it is true or just an illusion. If only it weren't a true story. If you have read the story and believe that you are witnessing yet another worthless piece of cinema work, you are more than wrong. This movie is well directed, well acted and well written. It is not one of those stupid slasher-like super-natural films. This one actually makes you think and carefully analize every scene, every character, every situation. No glamorous visual effects, although, trust me, you won't even feel the need. Just brilliant film editing, and extremely moody music. Richard Gere does one of his best performances, although i can't compare it with any other film, because honestly, i never thought much of him so i might have missed some of his better ones. ( Trust me, definetly not The Jackal ). Will Patton and Laura Linney make more than just a good impression ( i am on the other hand Mr. Patton's fan, since i am most impressed by actors in supporting roles, they kind of give a movie some flavour ). But yet the best character is the Mothman himself, giving a strange, apocaliptic meaning to the film, and unlike Freddy Krueger-like films, this ... Thing, will send shivers down your spine without really being too graphic about it. What's worst about the whole story is that it really happened. Well maybe here and there, the imagination of the director might, i say , might have tampered with the story, but i still think this is a great script and really none of that tipical Hollywood sci-fi improvement. A simple movie, done with a lower budget than Star Wars Episode II (you know the rest) but accomplishing more than the previously mentioned pre-upgrade to a serie that went too far. It is impossible for high-budgeters like that to just flip-over small but inovative films that give more atmosphere and less eye-poppers.Truly a film worth seeing, but one for which you must keep an open mind, even if you are the non-believer type, and keep you eyes wide open because blink, and you might just lose a key-frame to the entire story. Keep touh with reality but take it further. Give this movie a chance and you won't be disappointed. Because, they don't make them like they used to.

The screenplay is very tight, full of intrigue and suspense at every turn.  The presentation by director Mark Pellington is nothing short of superb.  From a visual standpoint, Pellington heightens both the suspense and paranormal feel with some of the best camerawork I have seen in some time.  Each shot is meticulously planned for maximum effect and the editing is phenomenal.  He mixes tight shots with odd perspective shots, extreme close-ups and vistas, zooming in, zooming out, and giving the viewer a visual workout that never lets up.This is a story that teeters on the line between believable and incredible as an entire town seems to be receiving supernatural warnings of an impending disaster.  Not only is it well told, but well acted.Richard Gere seems determined to break his own mold as an actor, taking chances that keep paying off.  Long considered a lightweight pretty-boy with limited breadth, Gere continues to surprise me with his growth as an actor.  I was impressed by the mature performance he gave in `Autumn in New York', shedding his impassive macho image for a more vulnerable character.  This role is an even bigger departure from his standard fare and a better performance.  He gives us a strong and believable performance of a man totally obsessed with understanding the strange events in Point Pleasant and how they might relate to the death of his wife.  If he keeps this up, he is going to start appearing on awards lists.Will Patton also presents us with a phenomenal supporting performance as Gordon, the man fixated on the mothman.  Patton is a fine actor who often plays villainous or offbeat characters.  Here he renders a character that is paranoid to the point of distraction as he is slowly driven insane by the voices he hears.Laura Linney is a throw-in playing a minor role, but she has a couple of compelling scenes with Gere that continue to show her talent.This is a world apart from your standard hack and slash horror flick.  It is intelligently presented and well performed.  I rated it a 9/10.  It makes you wonder, what really happened in Point Pleasant, West Virginia in 1967?

However, you'll be immersed in these visuals like few other films. More importantly, the visuals are there to enhance the story, not mask it.

It is a suspense, but not so much a thriller suspense, though it is, but more or less a Suspense/Sci-Fi, or more commonly called a Sci-Fi/Thriller, But not a horror... You have to guess through out the whole movie,, that makes it suspense,.. It is based on a true story that is about the super natural,, that makes it Sci-Fi. And it keeps you on the end of your seat,and you never know what will happen next which makes it still suspense, and when a movie has such suspense, anything after that, that scares you, makes it Thriller.. A Thriller is when a movie has horror style stuff to scare someone in it, but is mostly suspenseful.. You see, a suspense can have horror, but a horror, can't be a suspense.. It might all sound confusing, but if you pay attention to films and watch enough of them, you will understand.. Example, Scream, Urban Legends, I Know What You Did Last Summer, are all Suspense Thrillers, Halloween, Friday The 13th, The Amityville Horror, are horrors.. This is because (in case you can't see the difference)In the listed horrors, you the viewer know who the killer/s are, and in the Suspence/Thriller, you have no idea, you pretty much have to guess.. This movie was done very well, a movie taken from real events, a movie that makes you think, one that can be put up there with the Sixth Sense, Stir of Echoes, and more obvious, The X Files, only this movie is an adaptation from real life, which makes it an original on it's own, I would give it a 9 or 10..

Based on real-life accounts of a mysterious figure that appears prior to catastrophies, The Mothman Prophecies combines the two.John Klein (Gere) has his first encounter soon after deciding to buy a house with his beautiful wife, Mary (Messing). During the drive home, the &#145;Mothman' suddenly appears in front of the car, causing Mary to spin the car out of control. Although nobody is killed in the following accident, Mary becomes convinced that something is wrong and sure enough, doctors discover that she has an inoperable brain cancer. Although John never actually saw the apparition, he discovers various sketches in Mary's diary that clearly depict the Mothman. However, as a journalist with The Washington Post, he's not inclined to fixate on the supernatural, instead turning to the very real problem of grief. Two years later, John is driving to an assignment when he suddenly and unaccountably ends up halfway across the state, in a small town called Point Pleasant. His strange transportation isn't the only strange thing happening in the small West Virginian town, as he soon discovers by way of a shotgun greeting from local Gordon Smallwood (Patton). Local policewoman Connie Mills (Linney) is called out to the Smallwood residence to question John, and despite the fact that he has no idea where he is or how he got there, the lack of evidence to support Gordon's claims that he has been stalking the residence over the past three days means that he is set free. The next day, John slowly begins to gather evidence of multiple Mothman sightings  in the town and becomes fixated on determining the nature of the phenomenon, and if possible, averting the unknown yet seemingly inevitable catastrophe that must surely follow. The Mothman Prophecies has gained a great deal of acclaim as being a fantastic horror/suspense film, apart from the long overdue climax, there is very little that is really scary or even spooky about this film. Pellington attempts to play it out as a suspense film, but ultimately the film seems to drag its heels before getting to the point. The film relies heavily on cinematography to create an eerie atmosphere, with odd camera angles, movement and transitions, but with limited effect. Some of the shots are clever, but even these seem to be about cleverness for its own sake rather than supporting the narrative. One scene which is bound to put some viewers off-guard revolves (literally) around Gordon's face to face encounter with the Mothman. Other viewer's will recognise it for what it is &#150; an almost shot for shot reproduction of Richard Dreyfus' encounter of the third kind from Spielberg's classic. Although based on actual events, as recounted in John Keel's book, one gets the impression that serious liberties have been taken in this film adaptation. The journalist and the policewoman develop an unexplained intimacy almost immediately, although it never results in anything that would betray his love and grief for his dead wife. It is in the interpersonal relationships that this film truly fails, a fear of the inevitable that can be neatly summed up with &#145;Richard Gere's ability to act'. If you really want to look at the supernatural, check out the longevity of his career and the huge sums of money he commands for his performances and pit it against his ability to portray human emotions of any kind. Now that's scary. The Mothman Prophecies is an interesting film, but hardly the nail-biting descent into terror that its hype suggests. If it was a work of pure fiction, it would more than likely be entirely discardable. On the upside, the inevitable paperback version of Keel's book that will accompany the film's release should make for some thrilling reading.

I am a huge horror fan and know all the tricks of the genre inside and out. I know exactly when a scare is coming and can tell who's going to bite it half an hour before they do. So naturally, nothing much scares me. This film did. Not because it has jolting music, false scares, and a maniac on the loose. It has none of that. Instead, it has an atmosphere and feel that gets under your skin and makes your flesh crawl. I know next to nothing of the real-life Mothman legends, and have never even seen anything on the subject until this movie, and now it's absolutely terrifying to know that it could all be true. This movie is a fine example of how you can take a society's paranoia and fears and turn them into a terrific movie. The film deals with things we all wonder about and are fascinated and scared of. Life after death, the idea of a higher being, foretold disaster, and strange events. All this and the movie is directed well, too. Very neat camera angles and near perfect cinematography. Perhaps the film is so scary because the subject matter itself is terrifying enough, but whatever the reason, it's just downright freaky. Usually, movies that are tough to figure out and have an unexplained and weird plot tend to push viewers away by overdoing it and making them work too hard for the answers. This movie doesn't give you answers but also doesn't expect you to find them, either. You're not supposed to understand what's going on, because it can't be understood. Not by us, at least. You can draw your own conclusions but there's no right or wrong, which is the beauty of it. The film also keeps your interest until the end, which is a big payoff. I won't give the ending away, but let's just say it's a great climax with plenty of action. When the end comes you should be scared out of your wits. Not by what you see on screen, but what you don't see. You should be scared about the doors in your mind that this film will open. And just some advice don't watch it alone at night with the lights out. You might not get to sleep.

I haven't felt compelled to write about the movies I reviewed, but this one I did.  Why?  Because I think my husband misunderstood the movie.This is a retelling of events which actually occurred in a little town called Point Pleasant, West Virginia.  While the movie updates the timeline from 1967 to the present, it does not dramatize or try to make more of what happened in that sleepy little town than the facts.  That's all the movie does, is retell the facts, which is exactly what the book does.  This is not a movie that says it has all the answers and wraps up the meaning of the events in a nice package for you at the end of the movie.  It does not tell the viewer what to make of the sightings of the Mothman, what to make of the prophesies, what to make of John's extraordinary journey that first brings him to Point Pleasant.  Rather, at the end of the movie the viewers are left in the same situation the characters themselves are trying to figure out what exactly happened, who or what the Mothman was, and what the events mean to the human society.

Like many who have gone before Mothman offers nothing new to its thriller/horror genre and certainly comes up short in terms of telling a story.The movie is literally a series of events, one after the other that have some kind of intangable relevance that often appear on the surface to be totally unrelated. Whilst causing some honestly intruiging moments and some rather ingeniously generated suspense it often becomes confusing and your left asking What does this have to do with it. When you trace the events of the film back in your head the plot becomes as intangable as the concept of the Mothmen explained midway through the film.Aside from the often pointless script and resulting confusion the film is well shot and constructed and clever in its presentation of suspense. You are concerned for the characters on screen and there are some genuinely freaky elements to the production. If anything this film is a pre-cursor to some freakish nightmare you are going to experience not long after going to sleep that night after seeing it. It is also as unexplainable as any nightmare you could have.It really is at the end of the day another film in a long list of true event thirllers and it is an average one at that.

The Hair's best film I'd say, with the probable exceptions of Pretty Woman and An Officer And A Gentleman, was Internal Affairs (1990) in which he played a very nasty cop. Gere was good as a baddie. In The Mothman Prophecies he's again thankfully got a part with a bit of meat on it. Gere plays John Klein who's wife dies horribly claiming she saw something very strange. Two years later Klein finds himself mysteriously in Point Pleasant, West Virginia receiving strange phone calls and fielding probing questions from pretty local cop Connie Parker (Laura Linney).Connie has been hearing strange stories from the locals about strange creatures and events which recall dead Klein's wife's tales. Events escalate to what was for me a surprising climax. But then I hadn't looked up particular event that occurred in Point Pleasant, W.Va. in 1966/67.The Mothman Prophecies is very nicely filmed and directed by Mark Pellington (Arlington Road). The music/sound is particularly effective.

A rather neat, eerie thriller is what.","Date":"11 May 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Mystery","Review":"  `The Mothman Prophecies' is the story of Washington Post reporter John Klein (Richard Gere). Klein's wife died of a brain tumour, following an inexplicable accident, in which she claimed to have seen a bizarre creature. Two years later, Klein mysteriously turns up in Pleasant, West Virginia, where he meets people who claim to have seen the same strange creature his wife saw before she died. From there a series of bizarre events unfold, wrapping Klein deeper into the mysterious legend of the mothman and the terrible prophecies he brings.From reading the IMDB reviews there seems to be a love or hate relationship with this movie. The people who dislike the movie claim to find it rambles about aimlessly, and goes nowhere. The advocates of the movie say that the movie's sharp visual style is eerie, creepy and captures the unexplained mystery of what the Mothman was. I lean towards the latter camp.There are problems with `The Mothman Prophecies'. The plot is severely lacking, and so the story is more a collection of events, strung together through some smart directing. The film ends with a climatic, but inconclusive set-piece and the pacing of the movie is such that some trimming, of perhaps twenty minutes, could have been advisable. This meandering is the film's biggest flaw, and is why the movie received a lot of detractors, as the mystery of the Mothman is never solved &#150; it's left open ended, principally because the real-life events upon which it's based were never explained either.What saves the movie from being a mess is the sharp direction of Mark Pellington, who injects atmosphere throughout the movie. It's achieved through a variety of techniques &#150; a muted soundtrack creates the eerie element of the movie. Soft lighting soaks the town in mood. Sharp inter-cuts of the mothman lend to the ambivalence of the creature &#150; we're never sure what it is, only ever the hints of what it could be. These all help enhance moments, such as the many strange phone calls Klein receives, transcending them from laughable events to genuinely David Lynch moments.`The Mothman Prophecies' treads a very thin line from leaden pacing to being creepy. It won't work with those expecting to be handed answers in a typical dogmatic Hollywood style. For those who can appreciate Pellington's excellent work with the material &#150; which is what makes the movie &#150; they may find `The Mothman Prophecies' a somewhat uneven, but certainly chilling, thriller. 7.5/10.

From the performances of Richard Gere, Laura Tinney, and even Debra Messing (even though she's not in it a whole hell of a lot), to the good plot, a horror one that actually has a message, and yes, actually a good one!  Richard Gere is great as always in this supernatural thriller, playing a recent widower who is drawn mysteriously into a web of the unknown in a small town that is plauged by the mothman. Laura Tinney, whom I have never seen before in a film, is a very good actress and her performnace in this was top notch. Debra Messing too is a great actress (both serious like here and comical). The plot only had one or two not so hot things about it, but it was a great one. I have no idea why some of the critic reviews I've seen from it blabbed on and on about plot holes, while I'm on the subject of critics, I know that 99.9% of them have no clue how hard it is to write a working story. Anyway, the plot is very creppy and very good, and delivers a very good message, and The Mothman Prophecies is just a good movie. On another note, this film didn't copy of The X-Files, even though it has a very X-File-y feel to it, the book's been around since the 70's. Concluding, this was good movie, defintly worth viewing. With incredible performances and a great plot. If you love horror movies, thrillers, or just movies with a message, go see this.

Feisty Linney has what it takes to go up to a guy and grab him by the balls! Cunning Gere has the suave, sophisticated, smooth action of a man that can get anything he wants. Some of you may be expecting a head-on battle of wills between these two but you will be pleasantly surprised... Here we see a more emotional side to them but nonetheless a superb performance with Gere playing the Grief-stricken reporter, and Linney playing the country girl wearing the badge. It's surprising how well the relationship during the film develops under the circumstances but I suppose we all need someone to depend in at times of hardships.

It starts of as a rather conventional horror movie and the first half of the film had me on the edge of my seat (although, to be fair, I'm rather susceptible to the atmosphere of horror movies). But I got the impression that the director lost the plot about halfway through the film, the problem being that he does not know whether he wants The Mothman Prophecies to be The Sixth Sense or rather Jeepers Creepers. Even though the (rather foreseeable) ending ties most things up, you're still left having to think about the film afterwards. But I have to say that I'm not sure if the director leaves things intentionally unexplained or if it is because he couldn't work out a satisfactory explanation for the events in the film. This is probably also the reason why I had the feeling that it dragged on too long, while the audience is waiting for an explanation. Also some of the editing and camera work, while adding to the atmosphere in the beginning, becomes a bit tedious as the film goes on. That said, The Mothman Prophecies is still entertaining and partially scary. The film also scores a couple of bonus points by not including a full-grown love story, despite the presence of Richard Gere. Make that 7 out of 10.

However, I kinda forgot it was fact and started enjoying it as fiction like an X-Files episode, albeit made with a bit more Hollywood zest. I thought Gere was reasonable as Klein but he definitely lacks charisma. On a side note, it was an interesting movie choice for him. Very far away from his usual genre. As for the actual story, the way it is told it is clearly intended to have a psychological edge in a way the X-Files totally lacks. And in places it works quite well.

This strange tale provides the basis for The Mothman Prophecies.  This movie is chilling, with an eerie tone that sets the perfect mood.  The viewer feels this eerie vibe, and has a sort of Oz factor of his or her own.  The Mothman itself is seen only briefly, as a shocking creature, and you can't tell if it's real or imaginary.  The only problem I have with the movie is that the story does not take place in 1967, when the actual incident occurred.  I don't know why, I just would have preferred that bit of accuracy.  And I don't know if the Mothman has ever been spotted outside of West Virginia, or before or after the tragedy of 1967, as the movie implies.

One the plus side, the updating of the story from 1966-67 and change of central characters did not diminish the story; the film's direction created a real sense of foreboding and an almost palpable creepiness; the actors did a fine job, with no sign of tongue-in-cheek. The dreariness of the West Virginia locale was right on target, adding to the overall feel of oppression.On the down side, the omission of a significant aspect of Keel's documentation of these events, the prevalence of UFOs and strange men-in-black episodes, left the film with an incomplete and somewhat muddled treatment.  The result was a movie that suggested a more vague, supernatural origin for the events than was derived from Keel's work (as well as from other expositions on Mothman, such as the late Gray Barker's 'The Silver Bridge').While the movie could have been better had it stuck more closely to the source, it does provide a respectable effort at depicting a truly strange series of inexplicable events.

Imagine a horror film where the title character barely appears (and may in fact be a figment of the reporter's imagination). Taking the legend of The Mothman from the past and transporting it to the near present, the writer & director made one interesting choice. Even more fascinating, is how they use the Mothman legend to play off a man's grief over the loss of his wife. Whenever we see or hear The Mothman, it is a shadowy or ghostly presence. It almost doesn't matter if it exists, as long as the characters and the town believe it does. This strategy works for the most part, though the last third drags a bit. The character of a paranormal researcher is a hoary old cliche, and the director seems to try to bring a sullen sense of dread to even the most mundane event, conversation or situation. It comes dangerously close to self-parody at times. Still, this fascinates for the most part, and Richard Gere turns in perhaps his most complex and riveting performance of his career. Too bad, it probably won't be recognized as so, because it's in a horror film.What I like most about the film is that it, along with last summer's THE OTHERS & SESSION 9, are rare examples of horror films which take the subject matter seriously - not just a jumping off point for a string of wiseacre jokes and uncalled-for bloodletting.

I'm not a suspense/horror/scifi fan. Still, I found the story to be fun enough--and creepy enough--to be worth it.It's about two hours long--and I mean long. About an hour and a half into it, you can pretty much guess what's going to happen, and you're just waiting for it to actually happen. Of course, once it does happen, it's cool, but the whole thing bogs down in about a half-hour's worth of nonsensical sidetracks.The Positives it's not your ordinary horror flick. There's no monster to root for or against; the ending is open-ended, and allows you to believe whatever you want to believe; there's no cheap screams, flashes, or other gimmicks to scare you, it's plain old creep-you-out dialogue that drives you nuts; and the acting is great. Laura Linney, especially, is a great actress, and I hope to see much, much more of her in the future. The score is excellent.The Negatives The entire film seems to be a blur. The Mothman has red eyes, and you'll see those damned red eyes in every transition, every cut-shot, every non-subtle moment it can be crammed in there. Transitions are blurry and irritating, and no two shots go from one to the other without some painful use of red blurs, random designs, and other bad-for-the-eyes material. The aforementioned open-ended ending may leave some people unsatisfied, and I'm sympathetic; it's almost like they blew their budget and had to shore up real quick.On net, this movie is worth seeing. Be prepared to be bored for a while, though; many scenes around the three-quarters mark just kind of drag, but it's all worth it in the end.

It sounded like they had rehashed it into a typical mainstream Hollywood flick, the type I go out of my way to avoid. Add to that the fact that Richard Gere was starring, and I was prepared for disaster. I was pleasantly surprised to see the film and find it  thoroughly absorbing and well-done, if occasionally marred by overwrought direction.The film looks and sounds great, with genuine chills that are often enhanced by having read the book. For example, when Gere's car breaks down and he starts to walk toward Will Patton's home, he hesitates. In the book, Keel describes a fear zone he encountered one night while investigating the Mothman, an area which, though undefined by anything visible, created a feeling of dread when he stepped into it. This is not explained in the film, but it still works.In the film of my imagination, I would take a more gonzo approach, chucking in as many elements of the book as I could. But as the book describes something creepy and astonishing on virtually every page, I can see why a major studio release would reject that approach. I would have liked to have seen the ubiquitous MIB represented, but perhaps the filmmakers were afraid it would draw the viewers' thoughts to the irreverence of Men in Black, a film about as different in tone from TMP as can be imagined.The movie can be ponderous at times, and I thought it was amusing that they traced the Mothman name to some earlier civilization or something like that (it was in fact a joke based on the TV show Batman, very popular at the time of the Point Pleasant sightings). The performances are well-done (I would have enjoyed more scenes with Alan Bates), the climactic scenes are gripping, and the intelligent portrayal of unexplainably synchronous events is remarkable for a flick intended for mass consumption.I'm glad to see this one is getting good word-of-mouth on the IMDb, and I hope it compels fans to check out the other writings of Keel---maybe the demand will bring his Eighth Tower back into print.

His is happily married to his wife, Mary (Debra Messing). The two are driving home from house hunting one night and Mary sees something. She freaks out and crashes the car. While she's in the hospital, they learn that she has a tumor on her brain. She dies shortly after. Skip ahead two years. John is driving to Richmond, Virginia to interview the mayor. While driving, his car breaks down in a town called Pleasant Point, West Virginia. How he got there is a mystery. He starts in investigate strange occurrences about a moth-like creature that his wife drew a picture of right before she died. John becomes friends with one of the town's cops, Connie Parker (Laura Linney) and from there, the two must figure out what is going on.I'll get this out of the way first True, the ending of the film does not tell you exactly what has happened and what the Mothman really is. But, that is up to us to decide. We get to figure out our own ending and try and come up with our own theories about these strange occurrences.  Also, the film is said to be `based on true events.' This is accurate in the way that people have claimed that they've seen this creature.THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES was a really enjoyable movie. It has an eerie tone and Gere is wonderful in it. About half way through the movie, John has a phone conversation with the `Mothman' and this is, perhaps, the film's best scene. It keeps you on the edge of your seat from the time John picks up the phone till the time he hangs up.Director Mark Pellington (ARLINGTON ROAD) sets up the visuals splendidly. His nice work of camera movements really adds a lot to the film. It looks and sounds great. The film is great to look at with its mix of creepy illusions and excellent camera shots.THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES is a fun, scary, engrossing ride that will give everyone something to talk about.

And the ending is more than suitable...leaving some things up in the air and providing no easy answers for what went on. Definently worth a matinee visit to the theather!

Imagine my disappointment when about half an hour into the film my friend and I were ready to walk out.  The subject matter of the film made me ask over and over as I endured the next hour and a half of the film, who cares?  The characters were so underdeveloped how could anyone possibly care what happens to them?  I knew we were in trouble when during one of Richard Gere's more emotional moments there were more than a few chuckles in the audience.  And by the time the film's final scene arrived, the audience (about a hundred people) was literally laughing out loud at the absurdity of it all.  There were a lot of visual and sound effects which helped distract the audience from the fact that at the heart of this film lies a story that is not even remotely compelling, only confusing and erratic.    One wonders what director Mark Pellington ever saw in this story other than a pay check.  Pellington's last film Arlington Road was at least entertaining, and I only hope that for his next film he will have the patience to wait for a better story to come along.

That girl rocks in so many ways; I hope Hollywood was paying attention.  Grace Adler isn't all she can do, that's for sure. My opinion of the movie is this  it has it's thrills, but there were way too many exposition scenes and it slowed the movie down to a crawl.  I hate it when a character who has lots of information the lead needs chooses to reveal it bit by bit.  For God's sake, just tell him everything you know! Dragging it out drags down the movie.  Still, the final twenty minutes was a great payoff, Laura Linney proves once again that by gracing a screen she can make you fall in love with her, and I am dying to know about the real story behind this eery tale.  Personally, I give this movie a solid B+. If you like X Files, then this movie is for you.  If you are one who finds that show intolerable to follow, you might want to skip this one.

Many things come into realization as they're happening, and that's good.Gere plays his role as I sense it was originally intended.  He isn't the perfect man here, he is just a man.  His supporting cast seems to convey Gere's confusion and disbelief.There is a lot of concentration in this movie (visually) on physical design. You will take note to a focus on symmetrical and blatantly asymetrical patterns, light composition, background sounds, visible emotion, and props.The only thing that disappointed me in this movie is that some of the things that were intriguing in the beginning were overplayed by the end.  Also, no explanation is given as to how Gere's character unknowingly travelled physically over 400 miles in less than two hours by car/foot.I also realize that it was based on true events and that my gripes may not have an answer, but, they are my gripes, and this is my review.I am glad I saw this movie.

The editing in the first sequence alone says it all.As for the movie itself, it really drags in the middle.  I was constantly looking at the broken clock in the room and at the reels to see how much more we had before the next reel.  Maybe the fact that it was sweltering in the place didn't help.  The performances were decent for the material given, but the material wasn't all that great either.  Especially with this one, it seemed really weird.There was a decent amount of laughter through this movie, especially through the more dramatic parts.  It wasn't as hilarious as Mission to mars, but it was starting to get there.  The movie was well done, but some of the points were just awful.  One shot had Gere walking along a wall, which made me laugh for some reason.  It was funny.  Also, the fact that he only had one phone in the house was strange.*SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS** The ending sucked.  Full of implausibilities and such.  Maybe it was the college crowd, but the number 37 should never be used in the dramatic context.  Clerks ruined the number.  Then, I like the fact that he was able to rip the mesh divider between the to sections of the cop suv right off to save the girlfriend.

Apparently based on true events, this freakish thriller starts out with a bang and although it slows down in places, never becomes really dull or uninteresting.Richard Gere is surprisingly believable as a reporter trapped in a bizarre situation and compliments Laura Linney's (The Truman Show) more stable character. Although Gere may seem a little smug here, that's just his role. Without revealing too much, it can be said that this kind of film can become cheesy and laughable very quickly if not handled correctly. This one does not have that problem.Pellington probably learned a little in his day when working with U2 on their Achtung Baby videos and incorporated it into his films. Not to say that the movie looks like a music video, but the choppy direction, effects, and camera angles all hint at a direction towards the MTV generation, which is probably what Gere needed after the last few of his pictures turned out to be commercial disasters (especially with the younger crowd). He's not trying for the romantic lead here and that's admirable. There's no romance between him and Linney, so that steps the movie up a notch.Overall, this one is worth checking out in the theater if you enjoy thrillers. There are a few moments that will make you jump, so make sure you have a hand to grab onto next to you. You can tell by the preview what you're getting into, so if it looks good from that, you'll probably like it. Otherwise, it won't kill you to wait for video.

Klein loses his wife Mary (Debra Messing) after they have a bizarre car accident triggered by a nightmarish vision she'd had. Some time after she's died, he's travelling on the way to rendezvous with a senator whom he's to interview when he ends up in the small West Virginia town of Point Pleasant. And he has no memory of how he came to be there. The haunted John finds out that residents there are experiencing strange phenomena that can't be easily explained away, having to do with a moth man type entity, and tales of doom being foretold by some mysterious character named Indrid Cold. John becomes so caught up in the mystery and trying to figure it out that he ceases to care about much else. In the meantime, he strikes up friendships with locals such as Connie Mills (Laura Linney), a police officer, and Gordon Smallwood (Will Patton). Cast & crew do well here in creating a consistently somber mood, almost right away, and crafting a mystery that's more about the mental & emotional effects it's causing for its characters than in the more traditional kinds of horrors. That's not to say that there aren't some special effects sequences here and there, but they're kept to a minimum, except for a climactic catastrophe that feels pretty convincing. The acting from all concerned is incredibly sincere; Linney is wonderful as always, Messing comes off as likable enough in her brief time on screen, the under rated Patton is fine at portraying a person caught up in strange events, and excellent veteran Alan Bates is good at giving us enough exposition to sort of understand what is going on. Still, The Mothman Prophecies may in the end generate more questions than answer them, but that helps it maintain its twisty, enigmatic quality. Location shooting in Pennsylvania is a bonus, as well as a stylized look that doesn't go much for bright colours. This is overall nicely done, and words like creepy and eerie would serve as perfect descriptions. It's worth a look for thriller fans. Seven out of 10.

It is also one of those movies which you also love because it came to be a surprise pang in the face - and a good pang as a matter of fact. The Mothman Prophecies is referred to as an UFO film but that description is partly right because Supernatural is the word mainly used to describe this film. Wait a minute, make it supernatural/thriller/horror. The film is reported to be based on the accident that saw the bridge on the River Ohio crumble and break in two but the events leading up to that are complete fiction. The first thing is that The Mothman Prophecies is set in the present rather than the 1960's when the disaster struck, so, to be honest, it lacks in fact and excels in fiction. The film does a good job of telling the story with a few stereotypes here and there but apart from all that crap, I actually, believe me or not, LOVED it! The film has everything from good, unexpected scares that make you jump out of your seat and crap your pants, to a brilliant dialogue, to a great supernatural story that ultimately captures your attention. I don't get why people gave this film such a low score, or stars, because this surely deserves at least a seven point five, if not belonging in the top 250. Forgive my exaggeration but what I speak comes from the heart. The film is believed to be an adaptation from the novel, it's highly likely because Mark Pellington is not a great story writer, but I do not know if it stays true to the book or is far away from being close to each other. The surprising thing is that I knew nothing about the Great Tragedy on The River Ohio (need to study my history) and so the events leading up to the climax actually had me shocked to the bone. Sometimes it is good not to know your history of a movie that centers around a fact. The Great Tragedy of The River Ohio is a fact that occurred in Point Pleasant, so you better not report me if a I told you a spoiler that wasn't a spoiler. The main actor in the film is Richard Gere and he plays a man who's wife is killed by the same supernatural forces that are randomly happening in Point Pleasant. John Klein is an interesting character with a background full of stereotypes but is an interesting result. He is brought to life by Richard Gere who plays John Klein with great focus and a lot of skill. His acting is top-notch but somehow people are saying the opposite of what I am saying about him. Laura Linney was nothing new and I found her as a nuisance. No more comments. David Eigenberg was great to watch as he played Ed Fleischman, a man who accuses Klein of being the man who keeps on knocking on his door. He played the game properly and to his limit....or so I think? Supernatural Fans will without a doubt love this film and the genre even more.When John Klein, a Washington Post journalist, and his wife Mary finally find the house of their dreams, they just can't believe their luck. On the way back from the bargain, Mary nearly runs over a caped, winged figure, jerks the wheel and skids into the sidewalk. She hits her head badly, and dies in the hospital a little later. John, completely devastated, soon finds some sketches his wife made after the accident. They all show a winged creature, yet there is no angel resemblance at all. Two years later, John all of a sudden finds himself one night in Point Pleasant, West Virginia. He has no idea how he has journeyed the 400 miles in less than two hours. In the small town, local cop Connie struggles with many sightings of a mothlike creature taller than a man being reported, while John believes that an explanation for his wife's fate can be found. The deeper John digs, the clearer the mothman's purpose arises - only to leave his life in immediate danger, as it seems.The mothman is something that is quite terrifying and leaves clue on disasters in the future. The Mothman has a terrifying voice filled with dread and sounds like a computer dying of a virus. The part where John Klein finds out that the mothman's voice is different, you then start being alert of every scares around the corner that re to come. The music is, what I remember of, quite enjoyable to hear because in scary situation the music will rise and more creepiness will be added to it while other times it will be a haunting soft low music that sinks in your bones, making it the perfect atmosphere for a good, old scare. The Mothman Prophecies is rated PG-13 in America but sometimes it has R18 themes that is cleverly used. The Mothman Prophecies can beat most horror or thriller films that are out in stores today, so I highly recommend taht you view this with a couple of friends but try and watch it alone.....with the lights switched OFF! The special effects are very limited in this film because it does not need to thrive on it but it does have it's moments. The visions of the Mothman are superbly stylish and the River scene was very realistic.Over and Out. 27 May 2010.

Keel (a book apparently based on true events), this tells the story of John Klein (Gere), an upstanding citizen and respected journalist who finds his life unravelling when a car accident involving him and his wife (played by Debra Messing) starts off a sequence of events and revelations that lead him into the path of the mothman. But who is he? What is he? And how can he seem to know all that he knows? I have to say that despite it's rather modest presentation and it's leisurely pacing, I have long been impressed by this movie. The cast are all great (especially Gere, an actor whom many find easy to sneer at and insult despite the fact that he's actually pretty good at his job), the script does a good job of relating important information while making the bizarre events seem pretty believable and the whole audio/visual style of the film creates an eerie, tense atmosphere that never really lets go of you except perhaps in the slightly disappointing last reel. This is a movie full of everyday objects that create a palpable air of menace and threat by simply sitting there as conduits for the titular seer. Those seeking simple jump scares should look elsewhere but those seeking an intelligent, thoughtful chiller that will give you goosebumps in places should be very satisfied.See this if you like The Last Broadcast, The Eye, Donnie Darko.

The movie is supposedly based on true events about a Washington Post journalist who suddenly finds himself in Point Pleasant, West Virginia where sights of a moth-man like creature has put fear into the townspeople have been reported. Richard Gere and Laura Linney are good as the two leads bringing believability to their characters but even they can't help the flaws in this movie. Will Patton is impressive as one of the troubled townspeople but his role gets cut rather short. The same can go for Debra Messing as Gere's wife who does well with her small part in the film but like Patton she lacks screen time and development. The rest of the cast are decent in their roles but none of them stand out. The film was creepy mainly because of the moth-man but as to who or what it was are never explained so those hoping for answers to the mysteries of this creature or about the events at Point Pleasant are going to be disappointed. The movie was atmospheric adding to the creep factor but it lacked real scares. The scenes in which some kind of creature are briefly show were well done but there aren't too many of them. The drawings some of the characters would draw made you wonder if some kind of entity like the one being seen in the movie could actually exist or are the minds of the townsfolk just playing tricks on them. As mentioned before the questions raised in this film are never answered like; What the creature is? Is it good or bad? How did Gere's character get to West Virginia that's 400 hundred miles away in less than two hours? And why is this moth-man in Point Pleasant? The best thing the characters come up with are theories as to what is going on which isn't bad but it isn't the greatest either. Some sort of explanation even a made up one by the writers would've been a little better than no resolution to the questions at all. The only real scary and suspenseful part is near the end when something terrible does happen. The incident that does occur near the conclusion of the film really did happen and it was very tragic when I found that out but I just wish this movie had been better so I would've enjoyed it more. The ending was all right but it didn't make up for what happened before unfortunately. The music was okay but nothing memorable. The pacing was slow which is what really hurt the movie for me. If they had made it faster paced while amping up the scares and suspense somehow besides saving most of that for the conclusion the movie would've been much better. Overall The Mothman Prophecies had an interesting story that was creepy, solid performances by the cast, and a little suspense but the bad outweighs the good in this one. If you're a big fan of thrillers than maybe you might enjoy this one more than I did because it had potential but besides the real event that did happen. The Mothman Prohpecies ended up being a disappointment.

I have read John A. Keel's true account book upon which it was based and was disappointed that there were several subplots which were not even in the book. The book was much scarier than this motion picture. There may have really been a Mothman and psychic premonitions about various events taking place at Point Pleasant, but the full story is difficult to determine now, since the majority of the persons named in the book either were killed during the tragic collapse of the bridge, or have passed since from natural causes. Mr. Keel is still alive.And setting it in the 21st century instead of the late 1960s all but ruined the film for me. The collapse of the Silver Bridge at Point Pleasant, West Virginia, is a historical event. It really happened at rush hour, with the bridge loaded with cars full of Christmas shoppers, just as the film shows it. The trouble is, it happened in 1967, not 2004. And, with better National bridge inspection standards enacted since that time (mostly as a result of the tragedy), a horrific collapse like that is hopefully a thing of the past.The Mothman Prophecies was a good idea for a film but it misfired.

Well, am I wrong?In a similar vein to 'The Dead Zone', Gere seems to be given the ability to perceive supernatural phenomenon as the result of a traumatic car accident, in which he loses his wife. Again, who knows why? On an impulse (unexplained) he drives from Washington to Richmond, and mysteriously finds himself in a small town in West Virginia, which it would have been impossible for him to reach that quickly (again, never explained). As soon as he gets there, he finds himself in the midst of every sort of peculiar goings-on you can imagine, but we can generalise and say that the center around people having mysterious and ominous messages from/conversations with/visions of a huge human-moth like entity. This creature does peculiar things like talk to people for 60 minutes out of drain pipes, burn their eyes and ears, and talk in an annoying, high pitched, mostly indecipherable voice. Whether all of these things were 'actual events' in 1967, I don't know the historical record suggests the writers may have embellished somewhat here.Anyway there isn't much more that can be said without giving away important plot details. Gere hangs around, determined to get to the bottom of things, and possibly avert a disaster. He consults a psychic investigator. He teams up with a policewoman who looks like the should be in 'Fargo'.'Mothman' isn't too bad a supernatural thriller. It has two main faults, for my money firstly, none of the characters are very interesting, complex or challenging, and secondly just a little too much is thrown in to the 'weird unexplained creepy things' basket, without being really resolved.

Say what you will about it, but one thing it wasn't was boring. But that very thing is what you can find in abundance in `The Mothman Prophecies' - a movie so fall-asleep dull and lacking a clear vision that I am amazed it is from the same director. `Mothman' falls into a chasm as its finished product tries to meld the horror, monster and thriller genera into one. If it is a monster movie it is without a monster as we never really see the mythical winged Mothman. If it a horror movie, it is not nearly as creepy as it could be. If it is a thriller, it is so caught up in the goofy horror/monster movie points to be taken seriously.The script from Richard Hatem, supposedly based on a book and true accounts, gives us nearly 2 hours of exposition and doesn't add up to any payoff, explanation or hypothetical internal logic. Talented stars Richard Gere and Laura Linney show their faces here, but are clearly slumming. Much of their conflicts here consist of going from place to place while nobody believes them. `Mothman' wants to pose questions, but doesn't exactly inspire us to ponder answers. It becomes abundantly clear, Hatem just doesn't have the imagination to think up any creative payoff or give the characters any real run for their money. He barely even delves into the legends. In lue of an actual story or plot, he lazily throws out a few mysterious occurrences to give the movie the semblance that something is or might happen. Even if all the dots don't quite connect. Nothing happens here, plain and simple, from beginning to end. Pellington himself has shifted into Neutral for this effort. Heavy on atmosphere, but crawling at a snails pace it lulls the viewer away from the Mothman and towards the Sandman. The one thing that Pellington gets right here is bringing back Tomandandy from his last film for an appropriate score. It's all a real waste on what could have been an interesting basic premise.

The colours and the scene transitions were extremely well done and great eye candy.--The performances are the saving grace of The Mothman Prophecies. Laura Linney was outstanding as the only character I really cared for. She was appropriately stern and sympathetic when she needed to be. Richard Gere did respectably well in his role as the tormented lead character. The other town residents also did a really good job, portraying the characters' confusion and vulnerability to the Mothman mystery.--I admit to enjoying the freaky phone conversations. Chap stick&#133; There were also some subtle hints at the Mothman's appearance during these conversations which was neat.THE BAD--The characters in this film are very underdeveloped and hard to care for to be honest. Richard Gere's character goes through a lot of tragic times - boo hoo. Watching a character go through bad times does not a developed character make, you have to put in those moments that really show the despair or anger the character is feeling and we get none of this from the film. I didn't mind whether Gere's character lived or died and wasn't really all that interested anyway. Also, what the hell was up with Will Patton's character? He couldn't decide whether Gere was stalking his family or whether he was a good guy to be trusted. Make up your mind dude!--I have said many times that I love getting information and learning new things out of films and I was expecting to learn about the Mothman during my theatre visit to this film. I learned close to nothing, other than that he is pretty damn freaky and makes weird stuff happen. Why have a movie about the Mothman Prophecies and then have hardly anything to say about the Mothman himself? From Hell does a much better job of telling us about Jack the Ripper and including him the story as well. I felt cheated out of my money.--This movie takes a lot of liberties with the truth. One especially annoying one I must comment on is that after Laura Linney and Richard Gere's characters have had roughly 10-15 minutes screen time together, she's already showing him confidential police files? How do you know that Gere is to be trusted at all, that he is in fact doing good? I know police are more thorough than this in real life.--The Mothman Prophecies has serious overstylization problems.

This line all too often tries to cover up the weakness of a movies' story and excitement (see the Perfect Storm) and is completely misplaced for this type of movie (as opposed to films like the Hurricane etc., where saying that it is based on truth does actually add up anything).The movie actually starts quite well. Shortly after a mysterious car accident John Klein's (Gere) wife dies. As we see Klein back two years later, he has not yet been able to get over the loss. During a car trip he somehow ends up a a small town where strange things are going on.This part builds up the tension. Not only because of the mysterious events, but also because of the strong use of audio-visual 'tricks' to enhance the tension. Add to that the eerie atmosphere created and you think you're in for a real treat.Very soon I realized that the strong points of the beginning were the downfall of the movie, too. The tension built up by the music and visuals never results in any actual excitement, so after a while I started to notice how hard the film tried to crank up on the excitement level. I got really bored by the overly dramatic effects by then.This almost coincided with the moment I got the whole story mothmen are prophets of death, there would be an accident with local police woman involved, it would all come down to Klein if she would live.Realizing this, the film really fell short for me. Because it became obvious that most of the events in the film were nothing more than attention grabbers. They did not mean anything to the (very thin indeed) story itself.Examples? - The fact that Klein somehow ended up 600 miles from where he was supposed to be; - The three nightly visits of a couple living in the house; - The eye injuries and ear bleedings; etc,etc ...Too bad the rest of the movie confirmed my concerns.Even worse, the story was not more than a strung together collection of plot holes.In the end, I felt bored, cheated for my time and intellectually insulted.

In short, we're asked to believe that this is all more or less, give or take, TRUE, probably because if it's true, it IS a bit scary.  But this is cheating.  Works of fiction, and if they can't, well, they fail, and they should admit failure, and not pretend to be works of fact.  As ought to be obvious, this story is not even sort-of true.  The author of the book which has been in any event loosely adapted simply made stuff up.  And not very well, by the looks of thing.  Beings that are capable of having telephone conversations with humans but are unable to actually tell us anything of value because (sigh) they're so much more advanced look suspiciously like the inventions of a writer unable to think things through.

The film barely had anything related to the real alleged events around the Mothman, and the Mothman itself is barely even mentioned.  The film goes on weird tangents that I can't recall ever being part of the alleged Mothman, and much of the story is fabricated to make more sense of the little events that they did use.  The obligatory romance between the two characters in the movie adds nothing to the story at all, as it's barely touched upon, and makes one wonder why it was needed at all.  As for the story, much of it is predictable.  The film could have been cut down from half an hour to an hour.  Probably one of the worst aspects of the film itself was the editing and directing.  Throughout the film, many of the shots linger for far too long on very unimportant details.

Now there's a REAL mystery worth trying to figure out!).But I digress.  It seems that Klein's wife, before her death from a brain tumor, has become obsessed with sketching images of a strange `mothman' she apparently saw moments before a near-fatal car crash in which she and Joe were involved.  After her death, Klein finds himself miraculously transported to a place called Pleasant Point, West Virginia where, it appears, virtually the entire town has been suffering under the same mass delusion as Joe's wife.`The Mothman Prophecies' manages to establish a moderately creepy atmosphere at times, but those looking for genuine suspense may be disappointed.  The plotting is just intriguing enough to sustain our interest through most of the film's running time and the movie never gets as downright silly as its bare-boned storyline might suggest.  However, the film leaves some rather gaping holes in its narrative fabric &#150; enough to make us question what exactly this mothman is supposed to be.  By the end of the film we are not even sure if it is a benevolent force sent to warn people of possible dire catastrophes (that one seems unlikely since only one person in the entire film is saved from doom as the result of his/its endeavors), a neutral force that only makes predictions of disasters that cannot be staved off, or a malevolent force that causes bad things to happen to the poor people who innocently wander across its path.  It is often a sign of a good thriller when it does not spell out every last answer for the audience &#150; ambiguity often being a virtue in this genre &#150; but we could at least expect that the force would work with some kind of discernible consistency.  Basically, all it does is scare the be'Jesus out of people for no discernible point or purpose.Laura Linney, from last year's `You Can Count on Me' gives a warm performance as the town's seemingly one-person police force, but one wonders when, if ever, Richard Gere will choose a vehicle that actually might challenge his skills as an actor and stop settling for all these bringing-home-a-paycheck roles.  A superstar can rest on his laurels only so long before audience goodwill turns to hostility and outright rejection. With `The Mothman Prophecies,' Gere seems to have more than passed that point. "},{"Title":"Mothman is Innocent, OK?","Date":"25 September 2007","Score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Mystery","Review":" The Mothman Prophecies deals with certain events which occurred in or near the small town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia, in 1966 and 1967. In November 1966 there were several alleged sightings of large, humanoid creatures with moth-like wings and glowing red eyes, dubbed mothmen by the media. These sightings continued for several months into 1967. In December 1967 the town's Silver Bridge across the Ohio River collapsed, killing 46 people. These events were later the subject of a book by John Keel called The Mothman Prophecies, from which the film takes its name. Keel claimed that the mothmen were linked, in some paranormal way, to the bridge disaster. He suggested that they were extraterrestrial beings, and the British version of his book (which I remember coming across as a boy) was actually titled Visitors from Space. More sceptical commentators suggested that they might actually be large birds, possibly Sandhill Cranes or some species of owl.The film presents a fictionalised version of these events and updates them from the sixties to the present day. The main character, John Klein, is a political journalist from Washington DC. After his wife Mary dies of a brain tumour, he finds a collection of drawings made by her shortly before her death, showing strange moth-like creatures. Two years later, Klein is driving from his home to Richmond, Virginia, when he inexplicably finds himself 400 miles off course in Point Pleasant. He finds that the town is in the grip of fear, following a series of sightings of strange creatures, along with weird lights and phone calls. When he sees a drawing of one of the creatures made by a local resident, he realises that they are identical to the ones in his wife's pictures. Klein starts to investigate with the help of Connie, a local policewoman, and Alexander Leek, an expert on the paranormal. (The name Leek is Keel spelled backwards). Leek believes that the mothmen are manifestations of a mysterious supernatural entity named Indrid Cold and that they are the harbingers of a disaster threatening the town.The mood of the whole film is one of ambiguity, with no real explanation of the mothmen (who are only seen in very brief glimpses) being provided. The one thing one can say about the film-makers' intentions is that they incline towards a supernatural rather than a rationalistic explanation. This is perhaps predictable; films debunking claims of the paranormal are not normally good box-office, so it was never likely that this one was going to end with Klein discovering that what local people had seen were in fact barn owls all along. Not only, however, does the film fail to provide a rational explanation of the mothman phenomenon, it also fails to provide a coherent supernatural one. We never discover whether the mothmen are benign entities trying to warn mankind of impending disaster, or malign ones actively seeking to bring that disaster about, or neither.Ambiguity in itself is not necessarily a bad thing in a film of this type. There are many horror films which become all the more effective precisely because they can conjure up an atmosphere of mystery and doubt, hinting at vague, undefined terrors without ever showing us them directly. A good example is Roger Corman's The Tomb of Ligeia in which we are never sure whether Vincent Price's wife really has returned from the grave or whether she is merely a hallucination conjured up by his distraught mind.The Mothman Prophecies, is probably intended to work in this way, but in my view never really succeeds. The atmosphere it conjures up is not so much one of nameless dread but rather one of an intellectual puzzle without a solution. The reason is possibly because its subject-matter is so much less familiar than that of other supernatural dramas. Ask the man on the Clapham Omnibus, or his counterpart on the Manhattan subway, if he believes in angels, demons, ghosts or fairies, and he will understand what is meant by those concepts even if he does not so believe. Ask him if he believes in mothmen and, unless he has read Keel's book or other works on the subject, he will probably have no idea what you are talking about.There are some good things about the film. The main parts are well played by Richard Gere as Klein, Laura Linney as Connie, Alan Bates as Leek and Will Patton as Gordon Smallwood, one of the local people who has seen the mothmen. The final scenes showing the collapse of the bridge are well done, and certainly the most frightening part of the film. Nevertheless, my overall impression was that this was a film which tried too hard to make something spooky and mysterious out of a tragedy which, in reality, had a rational explanation. Although it was supposedly based on real events, the film took liberties with the facts when they did not fit in with its supernatural theme. For example, it did not state that not all the supposed mothman sightings took place in Point Pleasant; they were also reported from in and around the State capital, Charleston.More seriously, the film ends with the untrue claim that the collapse of the Silver Bridge has never been explained. An investigation after the disaster found that the cause was the failure of a single eye-bar in a suspension chain. It was also noted that the bridge was carrying much heavier loads than it was originally designed for and was poorly maintained. It would appear that the mothmen, whether they were in fact cranes, owls, extraterrestrials, supernatural entities or figments of the imagination, were not to blame.

The film starts off in late 1999 with Washington Post political reporter John Klein (Gere- 1 of America's hammiest actors) & his wife Mary (Debra Messing from TV's 'Will & Grace') looking to buy a house in the DC area. Driving home they are in an accident when Mary swerves off the road after having a vision of some red-eyed creature coming toward their car. She hits her head, is hospitalized, & found to have some tumor that could warp her perceptions. A few weeks later she dies. Gere weeps, but discovers his wife filled a notebook with the creature she saw- some dark angelic being. Gere is solemnity itself. 2 years pass & he's on his way south from DC to go to Richmond, Virginia to interview a possible Presidential candidate the state's governor.

Laura Linney's Connie is the only character developed to any emotional or deep extent, or which induces any concern. She radiates a down-home sensuality, yet John never makes a move, even after saving her. Not even a peck on the cheek. Loser!

In The Mothman Prophecies, too, the male reasons thus since I am a male, I am heterosexual, and whatever females do - even if they die or leave or get in danger - they do so merely in order to let me be and look like a heterosexual. So, Mothman's prophecies actually hit it right! The woman will call. Even if you don't pick up the phone, even if you disconnect it, the woman will keep calling, either from the otherworld, or from below the water. Because the movie must reassure its male viewers, and teach its female ones, that the sole reason for a female to exist (or disappear!) in this world is her desire for a male, and that her interest in males is permanent and essential. I want you to be happy. = I give you a license to be a heterosexual and to get yourself (another) woman. Richard Gere is relieved the Mothman has assured him that all a woman is thinking about is - he himself. A woman is and must be permanently and unquestionably interested in (and dependant on!) male.

Pellington, like so many contemporary directors, has a background in music video, and doesn't give the impression that working with a good script is high on his list of priorities. The movie never seems sure of what it is really about, or what it is trying to achieve, and by the end of the movie after the surprise climax which you'll see coming a mile off, you are left with an empty, unsatisfying feeling. 'Donnie Darko' was a different kind of movie but still showed how similar mind-bending ideas can be made into an original and effective movie.

That's right, folks, this movie's based on true urban legends that were turned into one big urban legend tortilla and wrapped around a character played by Richard Gere to make an Unexplainably Tortured Protagonist Burrito (I've been working at Tumbleweed too long). I've never really believed dribble like the spirits of the dead trying to contact loved ones through seemingly evil ways, and I don't think the actors honestly believe it either; they may say they do in interviews, but their forced performances reveal everything. The movie itself does not do too bad on the creepout-o-meter though, and it's probably come the closest of any movie to actually making me worry about my well-being when mixed with the supernatural (still, not a lot of worry). My favorite scene happens in the first half of the movie when wildly paranoid Will Patton threatens to shoot wildly confused Gere, who stops by the house for directions/closure. This scene is when the movie is least hokey, and actually felt heart-pumping.

Skeptics, on the other hand, look for equally preposterous 'real' explanations for stuff that humans perhaps just don't understand.The Mothman Prophecies is full of mystery and subversion. Some parts of it could be explained, but negated by others. It's far-fetched but directed with such sombre timing that the unbelievable slowly creeps up on you. Ghost stories (yes, I am aware that the Mothman is not a ghost but I don't know what else to call him) are, by their very nature, far-fetched and this is probably why most people are eager to dismiss them. But most people fail to remember that their very existence in this Universe is the most far-fetched thing of all. There is an infinity out there than man does not/will never understand. It's arrogance to think that we've got our world figured out already and dismiss anything that doesn't fit in with our day to day lives.So yes, I am inclined to believe in stuff like the Loch Ness Monster, Bigfoot, the Skunk Ape and Little Green Men. Like the movie said, the Mothman has appeared in scriptures and literature of many cultures worldwide for thousands of years. Apparently the book on which the movie is based has more stories of strange happenings and info on Indrid Cold (who is probably the most puzzling, enigmatic character since the Mystery Man from Lost Highway), so it's perhaps a good idea to check it out if you were intrigued by the movie.Director Mark Pellington creates a spooky and haunting Xmas atmosphere and uses the widescreen frame brilliantly. Occasionally he'll throw in a subliminal shot of the Mothman (sometimes obvious, sometimes subtle) or use bizarre imagery to heighten the sense of dread or mystery. It's very well edited and has a lot more class and sophistication than many recent corny PG-13 'horrors' like The Skeleton Key or The Forgotten. In many respects, Mothman is a lot like The Ring in terms of moody atmosphere and cryptic messages. But Mothman, while not a perfect film, is certainly the better of the two.My main problem is that nothing is really wrapped up. I mean I know it cannot be fully explained because no one knows what the Mothman is or who Indrid Cold was but maybe there was more explained or suggested in John A. Keel's book (the man who Richard Gere's character was based on) than the movie featured.Overall, it's a pretty good film and I look forward to Mark Pellington's next movie as I've been impressed with his work on this and Arlington Road so far.

I figured it couldn't hurt to take a chance, especially in light of the fact that many of the blockbuster films I had seen lately were flops in my opinion.The Mothman Prophecies is a story about a reporter, John Klein (played by Richard Gere), and the paranormal. He and his wife (Debra Messing from Will & Grace) just finish buying a new home. Driving home that evening, their car collides with a bizarre creature and John's wife is suddenly diagnosed with a brain tumor. Two years after the death of his wife, John is a star reporter. But a late night trip ends up taking him in a direction he never expected and on the trail of something bigger than any story he's ever come across before.You will probably find yourself asking why a lot in this film, just as I did. This film starts off with a few big why's that, in the end, I never felt were really answered. But this is also part of the film's objective. It attempts to show that sometimes things just happen and can't be helped. But what makes this film truly unique is in introducing a precognitive supernatural element into human tragedy. All of this flows through the film as one big mystery and is meant to stay that way. I can't go into too many details without spoiling the film, but let's just say that the itching in the back of your brain to discover more is the director's way of putting you right in the main character's seat. You have to learn to let those feelings go with this story.I cannot stress enough the phenomenal job at suspense that director Mark Pellington did. He's now on my director's A-list. The cast is wonderfully picked (Richard Gere, Will Patton, and Laura Linney) and some intense emotion is injected through their roles. The location and temperature were great and one of the ending shots was almost beautiful, while sadly memorable. Good creepiness accompanies the suspense, but this film is not horrific or gory.For a film that I thought was going to go down the path of Mimic, I was pleasantly surprised. If ever a film could do justice to supernatural sightings and bizarre happenings with all of the suspense and wonder that keeps you guessing (and interested and thinking), The Mothman Prophecies does it quite well.

Yet, you don't want to kill them because they aren't trying to sting you or chomp on you and inject something that makes your skin rot out.

I sat through two hours of almost when I watched the flick. The movie just wouldn't settle down and tell a coherent story. Richard Gere was actually a fairly sympathetic character. Laura Linney, a woman of natural beauty and grace, and Gere had some chemistry. Will Patton did his Will Patton thing. Debra Messing was there and gone in a flash. Director Mark Pellington just doesn't seem to know how to tell a really scary story. He wants the narrative to be surreal (we get disjointed) and other-worldly (we just get weirdness). I felt like I was seeing a really bad interpretation of some of Dean Koontz' work. The Mothman comes across as a cousin of Odd Thomas' bodachs, It seems to groove to disaster, but no matter how hard Pellington tries, we can't get involved with what's a'comin' down the pike. So, why is the movie similar to moths? I think it's because humans seem paralyzed by them. The little ones in your lawn are easy to kill, but put any bulk into them, and you want to steer clear. Both the movie and the critters are just too weird and alien to be appreciated. Yet.I saw a huge moth in my house years ago. Our cats were fairly mesmerized, and they wanted to bat the thing down to play with it. They didn't--I let it out into the night air. I didn't want to smash it because I thought the markings on the wings were cool and I wanted to avoid a bunch of argh on the curtain. The movie caught my attention just enough to watch it through to the end, but it was just too odd to really care about. Afterward, I thought of two movies by the guy who did The Sixth Sense, M.

Apparently, neither Gere or Pellington were interested in making a conventional 'monster movie', opting instead for a series of bizarre plot twists and sudden shocks, linked to various glimpses of the title creature in a number of clever disguises.Scripted by Richard Hatem (UNDER SIEGE 2) from John A. Keel's non-fiction book (an overview of the entire Mothman phenomenon to date), the film sports a welcome cameo from acting heavyweight Alan Bates as a grizzled professor whose personal encounters with the eponymous Mothman have reduced him to a shadow of his former self, though the narrative loses some of its dramatic momentum around the halfway mark, and the fiery climax barely resonates on an emotional level, perhaps because the characters are mere stick figures, subservient to the unfolding mystery. For all its drawbacks, however, THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES - clearly inspired by the popular success of like-minded chillers THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (1999) and THE SIXTH SENSE (1999) - is mature, intelligent, and often deeply unsettling, and both Laura Linney (TV's Tales of the City) and Debra Messing (Will & Grace) are excellent in crucial supporting roles.

It can be horror, a good thriller,... It doesn't really matter. So when being able to watch this promising movie, I didn't hesitate all that much. I only had one reason for doubts Richard Gere. Could he be any good in a movie like this? Well, the answer is yes.John Klein (Richard Gere), a reporter for the Washington Post, and his wife Mary (Debra Messing) have found the house of their dreams. When returning home from their bargain, Mary has an accident when she nearly hits a strange creature that looked a bit like a giant moth or a big man with a cape. John is OK, but Mary has suffered a severe blow on the head. She is rushed to the hospital, but dies a few days later. Soon after her death, John finds some of her sketches of this Mothman. Two years later he suddenly ends up in a town called Point Pleasant. He never needed to be there and has no idea how he traveled those 400 miles in less than two hours, but he soon learns that in this town, more people have seen a strange giant creature that looked like a moth. Of course his interest is sparked, believing that here an explanation can be found for the cause of his wife's death. He starts an investigation and soon learns more and more about the creature, but also about the dangers that go together with these sightings...Of course the movie has its lesser moments, but overall this is a very enjoyable film. Although I had my doubts about it because Richard Gere was in it, I must admit that there are no reasons to question his performance in this movie. He really did a very good job, as did the other actors by the way. Sometimes you think you know an actor and than he surprises you by doing something completely different, well this is a good example of that.I guess that people like me, who like horror movies full of suspense, but (preferably) without gore will love this movie. Also people who like series like the X-Files, may be very interested in this film, because this is the same kind of story. I liked what I saw and that's why I give it a 7.5/10, perhaps even an 8/10.

Read the actual case history.","Date":"30 November 2003","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Mystery","Review":"  Having thoroughly read the history of the alleged titular creature, Mothman, I was at first quite disappointed in this film. The real case dealt with people who were supposedly chased by a tall, bird-like man creature with glowing red eyes and incredible speed. The creature did strange things like flying without flapping its wings, and it sounded like a woman screaming. The case, never officially solved, allegedly involved UFOs, although barely a legitimate link to them was made.Instead of being based on these things, the film is more directly based on a book of the same name, which itself was more of a hypothetical study of what Mothman may mean and represent. A focal point in the film is how the sighting of the monster allegedly preceded disasters. In actuality, the creature was only scantily reported to have been seen around the Ohio river bridge when it collapsed in the late 60s. The film showed this collapse and is its finest scene. But then it adds extra mysterious details to the event, such as Mothman's ability to make people dream such an event before it happened, etc. This is an example of the film being based on the more glamorous ideas in the book instead of focusing on the facts of the case itself, which were far more interesting and would have made for a more frightening movie.   The movie is, however, well done. It takes itself seriously, is well acted, and features very good mood music and ambience. It sets the mood, leading up to some great scenes such as one in which the main character talks with the alleged creature on the phone. It's creepy stuff, but scenes like that are all too rare in this film. It had a lot of promise and was well done, but I had my hopes up for more of a thriller along the lines of the Sixth Sense, which was well written and acted but still had its fair share of visual chills. As it stands, the Mothman Prophecies is good, and I give it credit for getting a lot of facts and references to the actual case correct. But I was hoping for something much more based on the incidents as they were reported, as opposed to an opinionated book that merely theorized what may have really happened. If you liked the movie at all, I suggest you look up the actual Mothman case and see if you're more interested, as I am, in the supposed real-life creature of 60's West Virginia.

For one thing, when the Mothman sends Gere's character a telegram (or whatever) designating the where and the when for his next phone call, the entire letter is written in sentence fragments. It went something like this Phone call. Washington. Tomorrow. Noon.Should I ever decide to torment people, my tormentable letters would be written in full sentence form, richly endowed with subjects and predicates, as well as other signs of overpoweringly correct grammar.As for the film, well, it had moments of intelligence and stupidity. Actually, the strong scenes and the stinkers were packed so closely together as to jar the senses and provide the ultimate reminder of the collaborative nature of film. For instance, during the destruction of the bridge, some idiot sound editor decided to splice in a greatly overused sound file that originated in a Mountain Dew commercial to serve as somebody's scream.  A few minutes, Pellington dazzles by showing submerged tail-lights glowing underwater after the bridge collapse, panning out to eventually delineate the outline of the Mothman. You will very seldom see such a juxtaposition of very bad and very good in a novel, which are either one way or the other.   Pellington's strongest suit is in framing his shots just right, so that when he cuts to the next scene, the cut is visually significant. In fact, scene transitions were a vital element of film that I never recognized on a liminal level until I started writing screenplays myself. In cutting, you seek not to merely advance the narrative. The cut has to be clever or strongly necessary in some respect.I'll give it a 6/10.

It tries to put way too much into the movie and its filled with many different supernatural things and elements. It's a bit incoherent and you can often wonder what the one thing has to do with the other. This is also because a lot of things within this movie remain unexplained. It works out good for the mystery and overall atmosphere of the movie but when none of it reach a satisfying enough conclusion it starts to work against the movie. The movie is in constant motion but it doesn't feel like it's progressing. At the start of the movie we know and understand just as much what happened as we do at the end of the movie.Still its story and concept in particular is good enough to keep your intention till the end and director Mark Pellington is obviously a capable director, who knows to handle the genre but just didn't really knew to keep control of the movie its story. The story should had made some more choices but instead it decides to have a little bit of everything in the movie, with as a result that just nothing works out as well as it all could had done.It's not really the type of movie you would normally expect to see Richard Gere in but he fits the part really well. It was good to not see him for a change in a middle-age chick flick, or overly moralistic themed and dramatic movie. It's not necessarily a 'typical' Richard Gere movie. He's real good and convincing as the movie its likable main 'hero', you can also care about.

Human behavior, psychic phenomena, natural disasters; this film is curious and intriguing, without being too unrealistic.This movie is a good example of eerie occurrences, which people had sensed, but could not understand until it was too late. It was based on true stories compiled from the 1970's at a rural town called Point Pleasant, West Virginia. Richard Gere was surprisingly good in this genre of mystery/suspense. The sense of dread, the emptiness when he loses his wife Debra Messing to a freak disease.

It might have been a bit shorter for what it had to say.I missed some minutes of the middle so I'm not sure how accurate my grasp of the plot was.  Basically it's an X-File script.  Incredible things happen to credible people.  Strange figures are glimpsed.  There are time lapses.  There is a consultation with an expert in historical legends who doesn't want to be involved but who explains to the hero that the Mothman is some sort of prognosticating archetype.  Telephone calls come out of nowhere predicting deaths.  (I think I'm getting signals myself right now, from The Omen.)  The ominous hints make sense, more or less, when they are drawn together at the end and a bridge over a river collapses amidst some well-done and convincing special effects.  I don't know why the hero (Gere), a reporter for the Washington Post, is drawn into the story or where he draws his resources from, such as the electronic analysis of the voices taped during a phone call that indicate the caller's voice was not made by a human being.  I don't know why the somewhat looney local resident (Will Patton) is given warnings about an earthquake somewhere in Equador, when he himself lives in some dinky town in West Virginia and can do nothing about it one way or the other.  I don't know why Patton's ear bleeds either.  Not even a glioblastoma would do that.  I'm not sure why Laura Linney was given a prophetic dream or why she considers it an unusual experience since it makes as much sense as any other dream, which is to say none at all.  In Laura Linney's case, I don't care.  She's about the least believable hometown hillbilly sheriff you can imagine but with her lustrous long blonde hair and plump cheeks and sculptured nose it doesn't matter.  Richard Gere, I'm happy to see, isn't the cocky energetic Macher that he was in so many of his earlier roles.  Here he gets to look amazed and, at times, shocked and frightened.  (When he's awed by something, he whispers.)  Gere was my supporting player in a flawless gem of a movie called No Mercy.  Will Patton was my supporting player in the superlative art-house cult classic, Everybody Wins.  Laura Linney, alas, was not my supporting player in anything.  Patton is an extremely interesting actor.  His speech is full of retroflex sibilants, so that when he says sickles, it sounds like Sssicklesss.  His Ss almost whistle like Jack Lemon's after he loses his capped tooth in The Out of Towners.  But he's more than just the sound of his voice.  Every gesture, every expression, is fascinating.  He could be the Strother Martin of our time.Well, summing up, this is a rather drawn-out supernatural thriller, well acted and executed.  If you liked the X Files, you ought to like this too.

My review contains no spoilers but you will probably enjoy the film more if you don't read any further.When this film came out at cinemas I must admit that it looked silly and not something I wanted to watch. Years later it came to television and I decided to give it a stab and quickly found myself engaged in a film that will appeal to those who like the X-Files and material of that nature. By way of comparison to that series this stands out with the strongest episodes as the simple mystery builds with additions to the mystery without actually taking us a great deal closer to the solution. For the first hour in particular it does this very well, to the point where it is very creepy and absolutely gripping. After this point, I was preparing myself for a slide downhill in the second half and for things to come to an unsatisfying conclusion &#150; such is the way with films like this, the build up tends to be better than the actual finish. Here though the film never gets to a full conclusion, well, it does in some regards but not in others. Nor is the Mothman ever more than a shadow &#150; hence it maintains the mystery and uncertainty that it has in the very first scenes. Of course it is not perfect &#150; the romance side is less than convincing and I can imagine some viewers will not appreciate the way that many questions are left unanswered and loose ends are too easily tugged at.I'm not sure how true this story is but all credit should go to director Pellington because it is he who creates and maintains the tension and the feeling of being on edge. He frames shots in strange ways, uses close-ups, quick edits and sets up shots with the suggestion of something in the background but never has anything jump out. He showed himself well able to draw out tension with small gestures and without making it feel cheap or easy. The soundtrack is also effective &#150; small bits of feedback, whispers, weird music all add to the tension, chill and general feeling of unease that it has throughout. The cast help as well, particularly Gere who is convincing and low-key as the role requires. Linney is good and plays well opposite Gere, however she is so focused on being afraid and on-edge that she forgets to let her character fall in love with Gere's until the last few scenes of the film! Patton and others are strong in support although, as I say, Pellington was the real star for me.Overall this is not perfect but it certainly took me by surprising and was one of the more unexpected pleasures that film watching has given me recently. The low-key nature of it must have led to the poor marketing campaign that produced poor box office, however I enjoyed it a great deal more than I expected to and would certain recommend you give it a try if you like creepy films with an X-Files air to them.

Connie Parker (Laura Linney), a local cop, together with him will investigate those spooky facts associated with the moth-man. Mark Pellington, after the tense 'Arlington Road', does not disappoint and directs again a great movie. The drama in the beginning switches to a scary plot that looks like an episode of X-Files replaces John Klein and Connie Parker by Fox Moulder and Dana Scully, and it would be a splendid X-Files story. Finally the great accident, like in those disaster movies in the 70's makes this movie worthy. The sound effect on DVD (Dolby Digital 5.1) is scary and the camera movements (like in 'Evil Dead' and the introduction of 'The Lost Boys') are wonderful. Although the screenplay raises many unanswered questions, it is a great movie with a remark the X-Files fans will certainly love it. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil) A Última Profecia (The Last Prophecy) "},{"Title":"What I learned from this movie","Date":"23 June 2010","Score":"0 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Mystery","Review":" Hunting monsters makes your lips chapped. Worst product placement ever! But seriously, I felt this movie was visually excellent, the script just couldn't come close to matching the quality of the imagery. The suspense, which took a while to reach a certain level, seemed to simply linger on a plateau and the climactic scene couldn't quite push it up to the top. I had great expectations going into this, but felt disappointed by the time it finally ended. Not long after watching this movie some unknown object struck the windshield of my wife's car while she was driving alone at night. She was unhurt but the windshield had to be replaced. Damn Mothman can cost you some money, let me tell you! The only thing more arduous than sitting through this film is coming up with ten lines to review this stinker! Just a few more clicks and I'm done, come on, COME ON! YES!!! Finally. Five stars for the pretty camera-work.

Basically Washington Post journalist John Klein (Richard Gere) and his wife Mary (Debra Messing) find their perfect home, but soon after moving in they have a car accident, where Mary swerved to avoid hitting a dark, caped figure. John was unharmed, but Mary hit her head badly and dies in hospital, but not before leaving some sketches of what she saw, they show a winged creature. Two years pass, and while driving his car John wakes up and finds himself in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, with no idea of how journeyed 400 miles in less than two hours. He meets Gordon Smallwood (Will Patton) who for some reason recognises him, but after a misunderstanding claims to have seen strange things like maybe Mary saw. Local police officer Connie Mills (Laura Linney) has many other reports of people claiming to have sighted a strange, dark and tall moth-like creature, and John gets many phone calls from a non-human voice, so he starts looking for an explanation. John also gets some help from expert on the subject of the supernatural Alexander Leek (Alan Bates), who convinces him that it is not just him, but the whole town is in danger of the wrath from the mothman. Some of the questions posed in the film about what's real and not, the mothman itself and the disaster element are unanswered, but Gere isn't too bad, and there are some creepy moments to I suppose grab you, and it is supposedly based on true events. Worth watching!

Even whatever derivative, lowbudget, imagination-deficient trash you're currently thinking of featured a monster, right? The Mothman Prophecies takes the approach of Roland Emmerich's horrible Godzilla remake surely audiences are more interested in the boringass life of some journalist than the monster of the title, right? However, where Godzilla at least managed to remember to include some scenes of its titular monster fussing up shizz, this movie does not feature the Mothman, at all, ever. Just take a moment to reread that sentence, please. In a movie called The Mothman Prophecies, based on the Mothman phenomenon (a series of sightings of a creepy, manlike winged being in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, 1966-67), the Mothman does not appear. There is not a single frame of this movie that features even the smallest body part of the Mothman. What we get instead is Richard Gere's character, driving around aimlessly at night, sitting in his hotel room at night, or talking to the boring locals at night. You know, the sort of scenes that should build tension, making the monster's appearance that much more effective. But since there is no such appearance, we get instead two hours of sustained tedium. Honestly, what's next? A Batman movie about some Gotham City cop who just patrols the streets for two hours, not even encountering any crimes, occasionally thinking about Batman, whom he has never seen, & never will, because he's not in the film? A James Bond movie that focuses on the grieving widow of some evil henchman, wondering what the man who killed him looked like, but not knowing, because she's never met him & he's not in the film? Actually, both of those sound far more interesting than this movie. If you'll excuse me, I've got to fly to Hollywood to make some pitches.

It may have been difficult enough to believe THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES was a  true story  if it had remained set in the 60s but by placing it at the turn of the millenuim it`s impossible to take seriously . For example after an incident a character is seen calling 911 on a mobile phone something that couldn`t have possibly happened in the 1960s . It`s a bit like SCINDLER`S LIST when you know a scene couldn`t have happened like that and find yourself questioning  how much else has been inventedDespite this serious criticism I did like THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES . Okay so I didn`t believe this was a true story but there`s still much to admire . Director Mark Pellington brings a bleak atmosphere to the movie and there`s a couple of scenes that made me jump out of my seat . The cast are fairly good but Gere is inconsistent . Let`s face it , he`s a movie star because of his looks not because he has an abundance of thespian talent , but I`ll give him credit for his performance opposite Debra Messing at the start of the film which both poignant and moving .So a thumbs up from me because it`s a haunting supernatural drama , even though I take the true story with a big pinch of salt  "}]
