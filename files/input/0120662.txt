I did however recently pick up the DVD in the $5.99 rack at Target mainly because I really like Ewan McGregor and Ashley Judd. They did do their usual fine job of acting but I must admit that the plot was convoluted and illogical and the first time through watching it normally, I was disappointed in the lingering confusion.I then watched the one deleted scene and the alternate ending and it changed my whole perspective. Sometimes alternate endings do not really change much but this was the most dramatically different alternate ending I have ever seen. It wrapped up everything for me and made the whole thing crystal clear and satisfying.I can not imagine why they left out this long segment that does not so much result in an alternate ending per se, but rather fills in a lot of the holes that I had in my head. It is worth your time to rent the DVD and see this alternate ending. It may change your mind about the movie.

This is much the case with this movie. It's a sort of David Cronenberg meets Roman Polanski type of film, mixed in with a bit of Stanley Kubrick. Needless to say, the movie is a surreal one, that incorporates a brilliant cast with an incredible script and wonderful artistic direction.It's hard to say what the film is about, other than to suggest it's about obsession. That's the way I see it at least. The acting really brings out the reality of the film, and all I can say is Ewan McGregor and Ashley Judd are just magical together in this film! K.D. Lang, well, I didn't really like her in the film at all; I felt her character didn't do much for the film.If your kind of film is a dynamic, unpredictable, original and surrealistic film, then this one would be a good addition to your list of seen films. If not, and you prefer action-based films, then this movie could definitely hit it off. It has elements of almost all film genres, so everyone should go out and see it!

Is it so hard to appreciate a movie that is different?  Does every movie have to have a huge exploding climax and a fairy-tale ending?  Don't you suppose some things in life don't work out that way?  I appreciate this movie for telling a story that is different - it's so sad that people are so narrow-minded. *rant over**SPOILERS*Okay, here is my interpretation of the film, since legions of people have reviewed this film not understanding it.  It is my interpretation, and since I have not read the book on which this story is based - it is therefore not necessarily accurate.The Eye is hired to watch Joanna, and he is supposed to catch her in something.  During which, the Eye sees a physical likeness of her to his daughter whom he lost when his wife left him.  While he tails Joanna, he learns her sad story of how she lost her father and this triggers some sort of psychological connection with her - since he lost her daughter.Joanna meets a blind rich man named Leonard, and because he can't see her and therefore she feels that he can't see her phoniness and is not attracted to the phony image she portrays when others fall in lust with her, she trusts him inherently and eventually falls in love with him.  She proposes to him, and he accepts.At this point, one is not sure whether the Eye is in love with Joanna since his hallucination of his daughter asks if he is jealous to which he affirms.  Nevertheless, the Eye tries to stop them from getting married and inadvertently causes them to have a car accident and Leonard dies.Joanna goes on the run again, and checks into a hotel.  A detective who has been following her enters her hotel room, and she shoots him and runs off hurriedly.  The Eye manages to extract a pubic hair from the bathtub and finds out her real name.  The Eye then goes to a correction facility where Joanna used to go as a young girl and meets Dr Jeanne who explains her past, and that she taught Joanna some of her survival skills.Joanna's car breaks down and she gets picked up by Gary and they stay over at a motel.  Gary tries to get her on drugs but she refuses and Gary gets violent on her, kicking her and killing Leonard's child which was growing inside her.  The Eye comes into save her, but as he gets rid of Gary, he goes back to the motel and finds Joanna has run off again.With the help of Hilary, the Eye tracks Joanna down at a hospital and learns that Joanna lost her baby.  While she is sleeping, he puts on his wife's wedding ring on her finger - which of course implies that he sees his wife's likeness in Joanna.Joanna learns that someone was tracking her and helping her, and almost catches the Eye as he was tailing her.  She gets surrounded by police who have tracked her down - and the Eye risks his life to let her get away.  Joanna flees to Alaska and finally the Eye meets Joanna face to face although Joanna doesn't know yet that the Eye is her guardian angel.  The police use Dr Jeanne to try and identify Joanna when they track her down to the diner where Joanna works - but Dr Jeanne refuses to divulge Joanna.  The Eye once again rescues her, by asking her to flee in his car.When they are in the Eye's trailer, it dawns on her that the Eye is her guardian angel, and she is so scared she shoots the Eye with the gun that the Eye already set up for her to use (containing blanks).  She drives off in his car, and he chases her on a motorbike.  She crashes and he pulls her out of the car, and finally Joanna comes to accept her guardian's true identity - having remembered all the times where she saw his face briefly.At this point, it is implied that they get together - but it is all left to your imagination.  The Eye feels that he has redeemed himself, by watching over Joanna, chasing her and finally getting her to accept him (redeeming him from his feeling of failure over losing his wife and daughter, and his inability to track them down) - and Joanna meets her guardian angel - a protective fatherly figure who accepts her for who she is.

So was Eye Of The Beholder a let down? Well the answer has to be a no! I went to this movie having seen a single trailer that looked more intruiging that 'mindblowing' and I think that's the whole basis of the film. It's not an epic or a groundbreaking Matrix-esque special effects extravaganza...It doesn't pretend to be. It's straight up and honest. It's not glamorous and sometimes you wonder why the characters are doing what they're doing. The ghost of McGregor's daughter is an interesting addition that shows his lonliness and complusion to the job and at the same time his yearning and feeling of loss towards her.

The son is murdered by a mysterious girlfriend, played by Ashley Judd, and our spy starts to tail Judd from afar, using all the paraphernalia of his trade. He becomes more and more obsessed and soon progresses from spy to stalker to guardian angel as she disposes of lover after lover during her dashes across the States, winding up in Alaska, at the end of the world. Not until the last act do the stalker and the killer exchange any meaningful dialogue, and, on the trudge to the final act, we learn very little about the two characters and even less about their motivations.Like many movies, this one draws extremes of praise and rancour. It is not an enjoyable film, but some elements compel us to watch it and to watch it again, and we are left wondering why this should be the case. From one angle, this is easy the two stars are good at their job and both are highly watchable. But what holds our interest after the closing credits is more significant and that is that this film could have been so much better, that some poor decisions were taken at the writing stage and that with these two headliners, Eye of the Beholder could have been a memorable offering. MacGregor's stalker is fleshed out almost entirely by the irritating presence in his imagination of his daughter, whom he lost when his wife left some time ago, and his imaginary conversations with this child provide some vestiges of character and motivation; other than that, we are on our own. A couple of minutes at the beginning with the character interacting with a real girlfriend or on some sort of assignment might have had us rooting for him much, much more. As it is, he is hardly more than a cipher. Similarly, Judd's killer is even more of a mystery and we never really understand why she is so murderous. Again, a few minutes of exposition in the early stages could have heightened the viewer's interest in and empathy for her character as she is presented to us, our only interest in her is that she's being played by Ashley Judd. Neither Judd nor MacGregor could have done anymore with the material given to them, short of returning the screenplay with a polite no, thank you.I could not recommend this movie, nor could I call it a bad movie. For me, Ashley Judd could never be boring, and there are bucketloads of moviegoers who would sit back happily while Ewan MacGregor painted a wall white and watched it dry. But, aside from curiosity about the two stars, unless you are interested in how and why projects with good potential fail to deliver the goods so spectacularly, this is probably one to avoid. Which is something of a shame.

Those naysayers should actually read the posted comments.I watched the film twice, read Marc Behm's book and then watched it again.  I would like to see the original film version, 'Mortelle randonnée'(1983) (it has a really good soundtrack album by Carla Bley), but so far have not found a video-rental shop that has a copy.  Like the director, Stephan Elliott's major film, 'Priscilla, Queen of the Desert', 'Eye of the Beholder' is a road movie about eccentrics, one of whom is into wigs and changing her appearance.   Like Marc Behm's script for 'Charade'(1963) it is about a spook who is looking after a young woman who doesn't really know what is going on.  I can't think of any parallels with Marc Behm's Beatles film 'Help!'(1965).  Actually Behm has 13 IMDB credits, and most of them are difficult to find.   As are his other novels.The major improvement over the book is the addition of the hi-tech snooping equipment.   The book's Eye is an old-fashioned gumshoe who simply looks though bedroom windows and the like.   Also the making the lost daughter's ghost more solid is an interesting effect.   We don't have to know that the girl is dead to think of the image of her as a ghost.  I didn't notice that she is played by two actors.  The problem is that Ewan McGregor is too young for the role.  At the end of the book he dies of old age.  I think that the book captures his slipping into obsession better, and part of the picture is that Joanna Eris is about the age that his daughter would have been.   A side-effect of his computer tools etc, is that it becomes more unlikely that he would not be able to find his ex-wife and daughter.   But as the film makes him a Brit in the States, they would be back in Britain.Obviously the script had to drop a lot of the incidents in the book.  In the film it is extremely implausible that he is able to get a room next to Joanna in the New York hotel.  In the book he tails her for several months through a few murders, which would give him a chance to take a sublet in the building.  The rich blind man is called 'Forbes' in the book.  Given the real-life family of that name, it was probably best to change it.In the book the scene where Joanne is identified in the restaurant where she is working, takes place in New Jersey.   In the film it is said to be Alaska, although we know that it is somewhere in Quebec.  Why didn't the film say that it was Quebec.  Then the crew would not have to work so hard hiding all the French signs.   I presume that in 'Mortelle randonnée' all the places were changed to places in France (where apparently Marc Behm lives).An ironic detail.  The book has several cross-dressing incidents the Eye does nanny-drag to continue his surveillance; Joanna and a woman friend not in the book do male drag to rob banks and filling-stations, and the Jason Priestley character, Gary, is a cross-dressing fetishist.  I suppose that the director of Priscilla feels that he has done the topic.I would have liked the film to have kept the incidents where Joanna almost recognizes the Eye, including the time when she hires a detective to capture him.  The film has a lot more in it than most thrillers.  It avoids the cliches, challenges the viewer, but doesn't really gel.   There are too many nagging questions afterwards.

But whereas that TV classic made the plot device work to its advantage, this merely acts as a sounding board for our slightly unhinged protagonist.As soon as Eye starts chasing Joanna, the little girl vanishes. Is he cured? We don't really know. And it seems neither does the director.With smatterings of Vertigo and Rear Window, this wannabe Hitchcock thriller features obvious references to those movies and for the first half hour, you forgive the homages.However, it soon becomes apparent that there's no real story here. Just a series of varying US locations as Eye chases Judd from state to state, accruing a series of snow globes. A clever device for telling us where we are, just in case we don't recognise the New York skyline or the rollercoaster hills of San Francisco.As with most Hollywood movies these days, the one commodity sorely lacking is suspense. The gadgets and cast may look good but without some form of gravity, the whole thing flies away like a kite in a strong breeze. Too much time is spent travelling from A to B without any real reason. There's not much point taking a journey if you're going nowhere, unless you like the scenery.This is not a travelog. It's meant to be letting you in on precious bits of information as the mystery unfolds. What it does is merely irritate like a stone in your shoe as you walk down a good looking road.The film also features one of the poorest endings of any movie in recent history.I guarantee you will leave the cinema feeling disappointed as EOB doesn't so much reach a satisfying conclusion as reach no conclusion at all.

Funny thing is, I think there might be a good movie in here somewhere. I mean, was it good at some point until some outside force--a producer or a test audience, for instance-started messing with it? The plot is incomprehensible, something producers in screening rooms tend to not like. But we have to put SOMETHING out there for god's sake! It's got two big stars in it! My question is, did their tinkering make the film more or less confusing?We may never know. Having paid close attention to the film (the interesting direction and photography held my attention), however, I have been able to surmise the following a spy code-named &#145;Eye,' (the miscast Ewan MacGregor) who's afraid of his own shadow, not to mention losing his mind since his wife left him (this same subject was covered in the far superior Zero Effect), falls in love with a beautiful killer (Ashley Judd). He's supposed to be getting her arrested but, as he keeps following her, becoming more and more obsessed, he starts protecting her. Judd's Joanna is a parasite. She targets well-to-do men, feeds off of them for a while, then kills them. Eye also tries to protect her victims from her, but usually fails--until she becomes a victim herself at the hands of the scary, creepy Jason Priestley (yes, THAT Jason Priestley). He saves her, only to lose her, then finds her again. This time he has the nerve to actually talk to her. But will he finally do his job and turn her in or will he become her next victim?Before I start sounding too much like the back of a video box, let me just say that there is a lot here for those willing to pay close attention to it. Too often, though, it seems like it's trying too hard to be interesting, doing so at the expense of storytelling. It also seems self-important--as if they don't want the audience to understand. Some parts of it are just plain bad (like every one of k.d. lang's scenes).Like I said, watch closely and you may get something out of it.

"},{"Title":"Theatrical Version of Eye of the Beholder","Date":"16 September 2008","Score":"5 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" Eye of the Beholder is an ultra-slick, existentialist, avant-garde thriller in the tradition of famed Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni's 1966 cult favorite Blow-Up. This erotically-charged but enigmatic murder mystery about a British surveillance expert who pursues a seductive American femme fatale without her knowledge from Washington, D.C., to the cold, barren stretches of Alaska casts Ewan McGregor of Star Wars Episode One fame as a relentless, never-say-die gumshoe and sexy Ashley Judd of Double Jeopardy as an icy cool, mistress of disguise, serial killer. Although predictability never curdles this superbly lensed cat & mouse chase melodrama, Beholder shuns conventional Dragnet style narrative clarity and will inevitably frustrate audiences yearning for a straightforward yarn.As Detective Stephen Wilson, known principally as the 'Eye,' McGregor impersonates a younger version of Gene Hackman's electronics espionage wizard in The Conversation (1974). Unlike the reclusive Hackman character, Wilson works for the British Embassy in Washington, D.C., but he is no James Bond. Wilson receives orders to shadow the son of a prominent English official. The father suspects that junior has been embezzling money from a trust fund. While spying on this larcenous lad with an anonymous lady friend one evening, Wilson gets the surprise of his life.The drop-dead gorgeous babe chick, Joanna (Ashley Judd), tells her boyfriend that she wants to play a game. Joanna strips to her bra and panties and then lies down on a plastic tarp for her lover to kneel on and knots a blindfold over his face. Sauntering behind him, she brandishes a knife and carves her unsuspecting lover up like a Christmas turkey! Afterward, the blood-splattered siren collapses in a shower of tears, crying out for her long gone father, and then sinks the corpse in a nearby lake.Wilson contacts Hilary (K.D. Lang), a loquacious version of 007's Miss Moneypenny at the British Embassy and reports the homicide. Although he has been taken off the investigation, Wilson goes AWOL and tails the comely criminal without arousing her suspicions. Eventually, Wilson becomes hopelessly infatuated with Joanna. He discovers her true identity after he recovers a sample of her pubic hair from her tub and sends it off to Hilary for lab analysis. The results alarm Wilson because he learns that this exotic woman has a record. Wilson monitors Joanna with an incredible arsenal of electronics equipment as she commits one murder after another. Even more surprising, he abets her afterward by destroying any evidence which might incriminate her! Along the way, we learn bits and pieces about this puzzling secret sleuth and the mysterious serial killer from the expository dialogue that justifies the screen time parceled out to the supporting cast. Stephen Wilson's wife deserted him and ran off with his daughter because his job prevented them from taking up permanent residence anywhere. Riddled with guilt, this troubled detective imagines that his catty little daughter now accompanies him during his surveillance assignments, carrying of improbable conversations with him a la The Sixth Sense. As for the emotionally distraught Joanna, she suffers from a father complex and cries for her daddy after she slays her victims. When Wilson discovers Joanna's real identity, he learns that her father abandoned her at Christmas when she was young. Eventually, our protagonist tracks down Joanna's mentor, a harridan, Dr. Brault (Genevieve Bujold) who supervised Joanna during her rehabilitation. I taught her how to survive, boasts Brault to Wilson during a brief tête-à-tête, Kill or be killed. What novelist Marc Behm made abundantly clear in his book, Australian writer & director Stephan Elliot prefers to reveal only through motivated action. The characters rarely reveal anything solid about themselves. Literally, you have to piece the puzzle together from everything Elliot puts on the screen. For example, the 'Eye's' name, Stephen Wilson, is shown during a transmission link sequence as well as his occupation as a detective. The crucial bit of information that the filmmakers unobtrusively slip in is that the unstable detective comes to regard Joanna as if she were Lucy, the daughter his ex-wife abducted when she cleared out. Wilson is haunted because he couldn't prevent his wife from abandoning him and the specter of a little girl that shows up in his visions warns him that he cannot afford to lose Joanna. Basically, obsession becomes a nightmare for Wilson. Consequently, he struggles to control Joanna's life. When she tries to settle down with a rich, blind man, Alex (Patrick Bergin), and have a baby, Wilson disrupts her status quo relationship in a jealous fit of rage by assassinating Alex.Although the principal characters do little to endear themselves to us, watching their actions becomes akin to voyeurism. Everybody in this trendy travelogue is as predatory as you can imagine, perhaps with the exception of K.D. Lang's compassionate Miss Moneypenny character and Patrick Bergin's generous-to-a-fault blind man. Particularly loathsome is poster boy Jason Priestly as Gary, a scummy heroin addict who takes advantage of Joanna when her car breaks down in the middle of the desert.Judd has a field day in a role that gives the starlet a makeover of sorts every quarter hour. She decks herself out in all kinds of wigs and wardrobe when she goes after each poor guy. Unlike vulnerable Libby Parsons in Double Jeopardy, Judd's Joanna is a cold-blooded stalker. Often, her character is compared to a shark, forced to swim forever and kill anything that crosses its path.However, nothing about Judd's Joanna is glamorous, and the filmmakers aren't condoning her murderous activities. She gets her comeuppance in the end, and we don't so much sympathize with her as we pity her.Ostensibly, Eye of the Beholder relies on its stunning scenic grandeur, hip electronic orchestral score, personable cast, and the referential narrative qualities of the script to compensate for the omission of a formula, action-oriented plot. Nevertheless, Eye of the Beholder is an unusual thing of beauty that too many critics have mistaken for a standard action opus!

However, the plot line is very confusing; something seems wrong about the pace and development. There are a lot of loose ends that don't get tied up. This struck me not as deliberately ambiguous, but ultimately unsatisfying. It was as if they didn't know how to answer the questions they had raised, not that they preferred to leave them open-ended.From a feminist perspective, you're left in no doubt that the male character (Ewan McGregor) is the viewer, while Ashley Judd is there to be looked at. Because this is explicit in the film - i.e. he is supposed to be watching her in a voyeuristic way - it's difficult to judge the tone. For example, she regularly strips off without any real reason for it in the narrative. And since Ewan's the voyeur, we don't get to ogle him much!However, despite some dodgy bits and a somewhat wobbly storyline, the cinematography, music and acting rescue this film.

Eye's obsession helps him forget the ghosts of his past &#x96; his wife and daughter who abandoned him (or vice versa). So he quits his job to follow Joanna around the country as she murders wealthy men; that is, until she finds a man who CAN'T see who she really is, literally. The chase leads to Alaska where&#x85; Jason Priestley has a small role as a jerk in the desert whereas Geneviève Bujold plays the counselor at the orphanage where Joanna grew-up. It's nice to see the latter. For insights into the story pay close attention to the relationship of Joanna and the doctor, which I don't interpret as Sapphic, but as quasi-mother/daughter. Interpreting it as Sapphic is possible, but it's an extreme position with not enough support to back it up. People love to loathe this movie and it's obvious why The two protagonists are psychotics and it's hard for the average person to relate to them. Another negative is some unbelievable elements, like Wouldn't someone notice Eye camping out in the bell tower of a city church? How would he have the field know-how to get away with doing the things he does when the opening act reveals him as essentially a computer nerd who rarely goes outside? Would two Federal detectives really bring the counselor of the orphanage all the way to friggin' Alaska to determine if a waitress is Joanna? If you can handle these script flaws, however, Eye of the Beholder is a stylishly-made thriller with haunting aspects and a superb soundtrack/score. Even though it's hard to relate to or even like the protagonists the chase around the country maintains your interest in an entrancing manner. The movie's worth catching just for these reasons, not to mention Ashley Judd was one of the most beautiful women to walk the planet at the time (and still is) and she appears in some pretty skimpy outfits, uber-sullen though she may be in the role. Ashley's thoroughly convincing and proves her talent beyond question. I think there's something deeper going on with the story as well Eye goes through the same voyeuristic process in his life inside the movie that we just so happen to be watching, as voyeurs. Note how much of what Eye sees is through a camera lens and into people's private lives.The film was based on the novel by Marc Behm wherein Eye was much older and Joanna, roughly the age his daughter would've been. This was changed for the movie where it appears Eye is romantically fascinated with Joanna, despite her murdering spree, and he feels the need to watch over her and save her, which he failed to do as a father with his daughter. In any case, Stephen Elliott wrote the screenplay and directed the film, but was beset at every turn by the studio suits who financed the picture. At one point during the stress of filming, Elliott had to check himself into a psychiatric hospital for succor! This is relayed in Lizzy Gardiner's excellent documentary Killing Priscilla (2000). Thankfully, he was able to finish the picture. The fact that everyone hates it and it bombed at the box office probably sent him back to the institution.BOTTOM LINE Yes, the plot's outlandish, the characters are whack-jobs and there are some eye-rolling plot holes, but the countrywide chase and stylish filmmaking are hypnotic, haunting and entertaining.The film runs 109 minutes and was shot in California, Quebec, New York City, Pittsburgh and D.C.GRADE borderline B/B+ "},{"Title":"Close but not quite (Might contain spoilers)","Date":"18 December 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  This film was odd.

Likewise, the script is well written.The film faults lie instead with the general storytelling.We are given small glimpses of the back stories of the two central characters, but then left hanging. I would have like to have seen more. What brought these two people to the point they are. The stories we are given just don't quite seem to fit and aren't fleshed out enough. Although we have a flashback into Joanna's life we don't get one into 'The eye's'.'The eye's' hallucinations of his lost daughter are an interesting conception that is, unfortunately, never fully realised or explained. As is Eris' story about her father.The films ending is its biggest let down. Although there is only one way a film like this could end, I would have liked to have seen a more poignant one. Instead it fell flat and left me with a 'Is that it?' feeling.A high point would have to be K D Lang's character which added some humour to the proceedings but again, it was just a fleeting glimpse.All in all, I would probably recommend this film for two reasons only, McGregor and Judd. I think McGregor gives an heartfelt and understated performance, which is wholly believable. Judd too, is good in her role and makes the most of it, but I have seen both actors in much better films.Its just a pity this film wasn't fleshed out a bit more.A good idea, but falling short of the mark.

He pursues her on the road photographing incidents but not reporting them. In some bizarre way he finds himself attracted to the woman, he is too fearfull and in awe to approach her but too attracted and dazzled to leave her trail or allow her to be captured, he rapidly plumets down the pit of insanity in his pursuit as he trades the obcession of his lost daughter for the obcession of pursuing this erotic murderess.

I think he also went to a lot of trouble when it comes to the cinematography which is just stunning in so many ways.  The special effects that went from snow globe to the next scene were wonderful to look at, and it went a long way to save the film overall.  A lot of people will dislike this movie, because the characters are so unlike anyone they probably know.  I surely have never known anyone even closely related to the two main characters in the movie.   Tho the story is confused and lacking in true substance, the characters are exciting enough to watch without much of a real plot.  It seems to be ok that there is little more than the two characters and the sometimes slow paced, sometimes boring scenes they make their way thru.  It's nice to just watch them interact, tho they never really do in any solid way until the end of the movie.  Tho, not for the story, I would recommend this movie on it's visual merit alone.

No one seemed to understand the film and I guess this is because they have been spoon-fed too many Hollywood formula plots.  This is not. Eye of the Beholder is not about a man chasing a serial man-killer across the country for three years.  On its surface it appear similar to Backtrack, where Dennis Hopper, hired to track down Jody Foster to kill her, instead falls in love with her and protects her.  Here, one must question whether Joanna, played by Ashley Judd, even exists outside the mind's eye.  Ewan McGregor, the Eye, we know from the onset of the film is delusional, continually plagued by visions of a ten-year-old daughter taken from his life at such an early age, he can only guess which girl she is in a class photo.The film starts out with the Eye photographing a man in front of a Christmas tree, getting up to answer the door to find a young, faceless woman with long dark hair, to whom he says, Come on, baby, lunchtime. The man then immediately hoists her onto a table, drops his pants and begins to have sex with her.  All we can see is the man's rear and the woman's legs.  Just to the right, taped to the monitor where the Eye watches, is the photograph with the Eye's daughter, who, like the woman and like Joanna, also has long dark hair.  After the Eye sends the incriminating and embarrassing evidence to every computer in the man's office, the photo drops from its taped perch. As the Eye scans it, we see the reverse, on which is written, Guess which is your daughter, asshole.  Go f**k yourself.  The Eye then chooses the girl who will be his daughter in his upcoming delusions.  A video call from K.D. Lang immediately opens with, How's it hanging, detective . . . It makes me wonder what you did before computers . . . Anyway, it's all hush-hush.The Eye's next assignment leads him to Joanna, who looks remarkably like his daughter might in fifteen years.  We seem him suddenly pained as he watches her, in a pseudo sexual act, murder a man in apparent cold blood, the first of several such episodes.  Yet throughout it all, the Eye attempts to become Joanna's protector.  As he moves closer into her life, the illusions of his young daughter vanish.  If you don't take me with you, the girl threatens him, I'm never coming back.  But he leaves in favour of the adult version in Joanna.The Eye never appears to be sexually motivated.  What he does for three long years, he does as, in Joanna's later words, her guardian angel.  But it is a fallen angel, whose deeds are always flawed.Joanna's life can never be free.  As complex and intelligent as she seems, she is nevertheless plagued by the father, who left her on Christmas while she went to get some food.  The Eye, meanwhile, describes his own daughter as a girl who had no choice, but to wake up one day to find her father gone.In the end there is neither a rescue of flesh nor of souls.  The Eye is like the Flying Dutchman, doomed to forever wander the earth without salvation. Did the Eye molest his daughter?  Is that why his wife left?  Surely there is something symbolic about the man in the beginning near the Christmas tree and Joanna's father's Christmas departure.  And how puzzling that the Eye, who, with the aid of all the government's computers, can find Joanna's juvenile record from the genetics of one pubic hair, but cannot locate either his wife or his lost child.  And as he travels from city to city following Joanna, he collects snow globes, reminiscent of Heidi, whose gift of a one made her remember the Grandfather that most regarded as a monster.Listening to director/writer Stephan Elliott on the DVD, I find that he, too, has missed the archetypal point.  I think, though, that most writers do, and that often the levels we search for in literature, come not from intent, but from the writer's subconscious mind.  But in the end, whether premeditated or not, the mythology of Eye of the Beholder, rides quietly throughout the film.

The camera work is beautiful and many scenes were neat to look at.  If this is all you need in a movie then go right ahead and rent it.The big problem with this movie was meaning and plot.  First of all these movie has many plot holes and no Hollywood ending, but that's sometimes okay.  I have watched surreal movies before.  I have watched plotless movies before.  The reason why they were so much better then this one was that they had MEANING!  The characters were too unbelievable and their actions so unexplained that unless you think real hard you can't come up with a shred of evidence as to the deeper reasons behind their actions.  You are told these at one point but they seem superficial and unconnected to their actions on a level anything deeper then the surface.  It in no way explores the human condition or examines anything more than a superficial glance at obsession.  It is devoid of anything more than pretty pictures.If you are used to American movies, don't see this movie.  It's totally plotless.  You should realize by reading all the other reviews that it is.If you are used to surreal experimental movies, you might want to give this one a rent but it's definitely in no way the best in it's genre, and the lack of deeper meaning leaves you with an unsettling feeling of WHAT? that is definitely less fulfilling then the Roman Polanski film.

After seeing it, I went back and read as many comments about it as I could to see if I had missed something.  It seems this film left just about everyone confused.It is easy to see why people either loved this film or hated it.  It was like the little girl with the curl in the middle of her forehead.  Where it was good, it was very good and where it was bad it was horrid.  On the plus side, the acting was terrific.  Ashley Judd played the sociopathic drifter par excellence, alternating effectively between vulnerable little girl and ruthless killer bitch.  Ewan McGregor was also convincing as the high tech snoop from the British Embassy who develops an all consuming obsession with Joanna.   Also, director Stephan Elliot gave us some innovative images and generally used the camera quite effectively.On the horrid side, we have an obviously flawed story that is exacerbated by very poor presentation.  Since Elliot got both writing and directing credits, we need to unload both barrels of criticism on him for ruining it.  The story had a sound premise, a spy witnesses a murder and becomes obsessed with the murderess.  There were so many interesting directions Elliot could have taken this, and yet he chose to go nowhere.  His attempts at character development just clouded our understanding of the story and the motivation of the characters.  The story begged for some clever plot twist that never came.  The only obscure message that came through was the irony that our spy's obsession to protect her became her undoing.There were other eccentricities with the direction that further muddied the film.  There were no clear indicators of the timeline.  As a matter of fact, there were period props that seemed to be out of time, old cars near the end, newer cars in the beginning and various props out of the seventies and eighties mixed together with nineties props.  This happened so often that I actually thought they were clues to some time based plot twist that I was supposed to be noticing.  In the end, they turned out to be irrelevant; just poor use of props.  And what was with all the shoe shots?  These added nothing to the story or its telling.  Also, how implausible is it that Hillary (k.d. lang), so obviously American, was coordinating espionage for the British government out of the British Embassy?

As soon as the suspense started to build, there would be a scenery change and you are back to where you started.  After an hour of this, you feel nothing for any of the characters. You are left with a movie that just drifts along that you never get into. I would only recommend watching this movie if you want to see Ashley Judd (who actually played her part well).

Lang.  As the film opens he is following an ice princess, played by Ashley Judd, in a role that mom and sister, Naomi and Wynona might wince at.  She seems to have a bit of an issue with men, violently killing them at the very moment they think she going to put out.    The film never really explains itself fully so we are never sure what Ewan's character, The Eye, is supposed to be doing, however based on his bickering with K.D. we do know that he shouldn't be spending too much time with Ashley.  As I mentioned, The Eye has a lot of neat tools and with them he is able to get detailed video of Ashley in the act of killing.  We quickly learn that The Eye has a bit of an infatuation going with her because he never thinks to turn her in, but rather protect her from authority. I was quite taken by this movie from the moment it opened.  A cold and vacant mood is set from the start that is a treat to watch.  Stunning visuals, over-the-top acting from both Judd and McGregor, and a host of eerie images make this film difficult to break away from. Judd has become popular lately for playing the female lead in pop-thrillers.  Her turn here as a psycho witch is a departure to say the least, that is fun to watch.  Donning a new wig every five minutes, she never breaks from her role as a tough girl who has gone over the deep end.Complimenting Judd, McGregor delivers a low key performance.  Still bitter over a divorce and the loss of his daughter (who, by the way, is always around) The Eye is not your typical hero.  This guy has issues. Supporting performances from Jason Priestly, as an out-of-control heroin addict and Genvieve Bujold, as a den mother for the ice princess set, help to keep this film from dragging. An unpredictable story, Eye of the Beholder works well right up until the final moments. That, sadly, is where this film crashes and burns.  If ever an ending could kill a neat little art-house thriller, Eye of the Beholder is proof.  Films from yesteryear like Get Carter and Alfie complimented the wacky era from which they came.  This one, styled in much the same manner, leaves us asking, HUH?

However, I am always willing to see a movie with Ewan McGregor so I have been waiting since the summer when I read it was coming.  All that having been said I found the movie extremely engaging. I was not bored at all and became quite involved in the story.  Ewan is quite good as a private agent looking for something to replace his lost family and Ashley Judd is equally excellent as the inadvertent object of his obsession.  Both play their characters as calm on the outside but traces of the deep waters come through in subtle and not so subtle ways. The losses of the two fit together however this isn't a Sleepless in Seattle kind of story where they meet and fall in love.  Quite the contrary, the Eye's obsession alternately saves and destroys Joanna's life.  In the end, this tale of obsession is part cautionary, part voyeuristic  thrill, and part catharsis. It's a great trip across America that stays on target throughout and couldn't help feel like I was still in the movie when I walked out of the theater onto the streets of Manhattan following behind people and was even passed by a brown station wagon.

Now let me stress the Usually in that sentence.  I went to see this film on opening night, it was a toss up between this and Down To You, i voted this because I like Ashley Judd a heck of a lot more then Freddie Prinze Jr, and it looked more interesting.  However let me tell you i wish that i had stuck with Down To You.  The performances in this film were not so hot, the story line was not nearly developed enough. (I am warning you now, this is revealed to you within the first few minutes of the film, but just for those of you who do not want to know, skip my next few sentences.)  For instance we(the viewers) had no clue as to why Ashley Judd had a fetish for killing people, all we were told was that she was abandoned as a child, on Christmas Day none the less.  But that did not explain why she felt the urge to harm others.  Then when Ewan McGregor's character shows up he has no past except for a wife and daughter who have gone AWOL.  However the daughter does show up at times(sort of).  It was not so clear as to why this Eye (McGregor) was even following Judd in the first place.  The only reason that i did not go back to the box office during the film and ask for my money back was in hopes that the film would somehow redeem itself and get better, however it did not. As i said before, thank God for the shoes, they along with Judd's ever-changing wardrobe were the only good things about this film, i loved her shoes. I also feel the need to tell whoever may happen to read this review that Jason Priestley (yup, the 90210 guy) was indeed in this film, and his parts were the only ones that provided me with any sort of amusement that i needed. So please, i beg of you to read this review and take my advice, go and see something else, perhaps The Cider House Rules, that was so much better then this.

What I got was something completely different.McGregor plays The Eye, some kind of surveillance agent, whose wife has left him and taken his baby daughter with her.  That doesn't stop him from seeing his daughter in hallucination form.  During a routine surveillance assignment, The Eye watches Judd kill his target, and he instantly falls in love (or something like love).  He becomes so obsessed with Judd that he quits his job, and begins stalking her, and comes to find out that she's a virtual chameleon, changing identities on a whim.What I thought would be an action movie turned out to be a very existential art film.  It very much had the feel of a foreign film.  The direction is very good; there are some things in this movie that I've never seen before (the bathroom scene is a good example).  Both leads are good (although McGregor's part needed to be played by someone much older, not younger, that Judd).  The daughter hallucination is annoying at times, but it's an effective plot device.  The movie does just kind of go freeform after the first half hour, and logic goes out the window at times, but those are hallmarks of foreign films, which this feels very much like.  A lot of people are going to see this movie and hate it (much the way that people who were expecting to see an I Know What You Did...-type movie hated Blair Witch Project).

The only thing this film lacks is a cohesion between these themes.  This is a difficult film- the transitions (handled VERY stylishly) are ambiguous towards time.  The characters are well developed, but only in subtext.  The audience sees only the miniscule tips of the gargantuan icebergs beneath, which is a testament to the strength of the subtle performances given by Judd and MacGregor.

At the 30 minute mark, I thought to myself 'damn, this is a good movie.' At the 60 mark I said 'still going strong.' And at the end I said 'what the hell?'The actors were great.

The use of the snow globes was one of the things I most liked. And the use of the horoscope signs was a nice tough also.

However, knowing that since January is garbage month for Hollywood, I decided to lower my expectations a little. As I watched the events unfold on screen, I was pleasantly surprised to see that this movie is actually very intruiging....for a time. For about 100 minutes, director Stephan Elliot takes us on a surreal journey through obsession that constantly toys with our expectations. However, when a movie teases us, we usually expect it to finally deliver something grand and shocking eventually. Not here. During the last 10 minutes (a guess) of Eye of the Beholder, things fall completely apart, concluding with the worst deus ex machina ending this side of THE HAUNTING. Actually, it's worse, because while the haunting actually has an ending, cheap as it may be, this film doesn't. Yes, you read that right.... EYE OF THE BEHOLDER has no ending what-so-ever. It's an offensive and embarassing cop-out, and greatly does a disservice to the movie.The ending isn't my only gripe; also handled rather poorly are characterization attempts. Presenting The Eye as an obsessed man who's long lost daughter haunts him in hallucinations is inherently fascinating, but somehow that element becomes ignored after a while. As for Joanna, her character never recieves a logical explanation of why she kills so many men the way she does. I'm sorry, but a single sad incident in the past does not equate to a well-rounded character. Of course, there's more info relating to a psychiatric ward, but that element never reaches its full potential either. Sadly, most attempts on characterization are never as compelling as Stephan Elliot thinks they are.There are a few things that I like about this film. First of all, the cinematography and musical score are suitably ominous, and greatly enhance atmosphere. The acting by Ewan McGregor and Ashley Judd (who knows how to overcome a badly written part) is solid, and almost made me forget about the routine attempts at characterization. Anyone who can almost sucessfully overcome a trite script deserves to be noticed, and these two fit the bill.There's not too much more I can say about EYE OF THE BEHOLDER, but I can't stress enough about how terrible the ending is. It's like freezing time, or cancelling The Super Bowl in the middle of a play for no reason, or... well, just plain stopping something before it finishes. Perhaps if there was a legitimate conclusion, I wouldn't be forced to go back and re-think what else went wrong in the movie. However, since there's no way a film should ever end like EYE OF THE BEHOLDER does, I traced my steps back to look for other seams, and I found several significant ones. Really, after viewing the film as a whole, I can safely say that EYE OF THE BEHOLDER is only for people who live entirely in the moment. Yes, the film is certainly watchable and never boring, but since it teases with the goods so often, it's downright offensive that it never does anything serious with them.

For me, Ashley Judd in the movie is an automatic 3.5 stars out of 4 before the opening credits.  She is just a delicious woman. She's strong willed, drop-dead gorgeous, and her voice is so sexy that I... well, I'll leave it there because you get the idea.  Anyway, I'm biased in favor of the film, just because she's in it.  So for me to come back wishing I'd slept instead really says something.Judd and Ewan McGregor are our two main characters.  McGregor's character was referred to several times as Lucky Legs, so I'll call him Lucky.  Judd played Joanna.  Both are tormented souls. As the film opens, Judd is a murderess who kills and disappears, wishing her father a Merry Christmas and sobbing for some reason that we don't really get insight into until about half way through the film.  Lucky is constantly engaged in dialogue with his daughter as he works.  He's some kind of intelligence agent. We soon find out that he is hallucinating and that his wife picked up and left him taking his daughter with a long time ago. He has a class picture but isn't sure which of the girls in it is his.  Sounds simple, right?  Too bad it took 35 minutes to reach that level of story development.  As Lucky is watching someone he is assigned to he comes across Joanna. She kills the man he was watching, and he continues to follow her.  This is the crux of the story.  He began following her for some unexplained reason, then his hallucination tells him not to leave her alone because she's just a child.  That sounds like a slightly interesting set up for a story but like I said, at this point we're about 35 minutes in.  Initially, it looked like Joanna would be a killer with issues, blah, blah, blah.  But after her first victim gets it with a knife, she becomes the victim.  She kills a cop who shows up for literally no reason at all and harasses her.  Looking back on it, maybe we were supposed to think the police were looking for her all along, but at the time I was thinking Where'd this guy come from?  Oh, she shot him...On and on this goes.  The characters are only slightly developed.  All you ever know about Lucky is that his wife and daughter left him.  You never know why he is compelled to follow Joanna.  Is he in love with her, does she owe him money?  You never know.  Why does Joanna kill?  Simply because she was abandoned?  The characters have no motivation so their actions serve no purpose.Jason Priestly shows up as a hood named Gary in a Jaguar who helps Joanna who's on the run again and having car trouble.  They end up in the rattiest hotel you'd ever want to see.  I should be so lucky.  A woman who looks like Ashley Judd runs out of gas and I stop and help her and we end up in a hotel!!  That would be better than lotto jackpot!  Anyway, when she won't shoot up with him, he beats her up and shoots her up against her will.  Of course, here comes Lucky to save her.  Big deal.  After a while you just start praying for it to be over.  It seemed longer than the Green Mile, but it was just barely 90 minutes.

It is EXTREMELY fast paced, and sometimes a bit far-fetched. How does the Eye remove his surveillance equipment so quickly once his subject is suddenly moving on to another life, another name, another identity???!!!In spite of what seem to be flaws, EYE OF THE BEHOLDER is an entrancing, haunting film about two people who don't know each other, but who are connected in ways that can't be imagined or understood until at least halfway thru the film.The Eye, a British surveillance specialist is sent by his boss to investigate the boss's son, who has been withdrawing a lot of cash from the bank. Boss wants to know what sonny is up to. The Eye is a professional, excellent with equipment, superb at watching without being noticed. It's clear he's been a spy for a very long time. That's why the former farfetched idea of him being able to pull microphones, knock down cameras, and slither from site to site without being found out turns out to be acceptable. His real name is Stephen Wilson, and his wife and daughter are gone, apparently because his work was more important to him than his family. After they left, The Eye realized what he lost, and when we meet him, he's been a lonely, isolated, damaged man for quite a while.The Eye locks on to the boss's son and discovers that the Embassy Brat has been giving money to a beautiful young woman. She meets the son of the boss at a museum in Washington D.C. and as she is captured by the Eye's camera, The Eye feels like he's seen a ghost. The story, and the obsession begin here. The Eye begins abandoning duty in favor of a sense of loyalty. Indeed it seems definite that The Eye has lost his sense of reason. His obsession with the murderous yet lovely woman grows as he follows her all around the country. Ashley Judd's many wigs and personalities are beautiful as they are astonishing. Do give this clever, suspenseful thriller a try. I think if you focus and follow the film, you will get it. It's a story of complete obsession and how obsession can really drive a person to do things they normally would not do, and how it can change them forever, for good or for bad.

But then he replaces it with an obsession over a woman who, on occasion, kills men. Her character is a large loose end, since we are not given plausible explanations of her murders and her murderous inclinations. Her childhood didn't really explain it. Perhaps her probation officer in effect taught her to overreact in order to survive. We are given to believe that this is the case, although it's implausible.Our hero doesn't turn her over to the police. Instead he falls in love with her. Meanwhile she has found someone else who loves her and they are to be married, but our blind (or jealous) hero doesn't see this. He interferes and ends up causing her husband-to-be's death. He seems to have no remorse or guilt over this and apparently thinks that he can still pursue the woman, win her, keep this a secret and live happily ever after. This is a giant loose end. In fact, at the end when he saves her from a near death that he himself has largely caused, she remembers where she has first seen him, and eventually she would figure out the rest since she knows a man has been following her, and she would know something about the cause of the car crash that took her fiancé's life (and other details). This too is a big loose end. Our hero has to be not only obsessed but quite stupid to think that this is going to work.So, what we have is a high degree of intriguing story-telling and mystery that depends heavily on very skilled people who spy and kill and move around, but at the same time rather blind and obsessed people who seem to lack consciences.If the story could have kept within bounds of more realistic characters and situations, then it might have succeeded. It might have gone on to rival Vertigo. But ultimately, it has to fall down because of its unrealistic characterizations.We are given too few interactions of the two main characters with others and with each other to build an alternative scenario. They are both loners. In the way that the story was developed, the most logical ending was for the lady to have killed the detective. He was virtually seeking that outcome.Being a tale of obsession and murder, this movie has neo-noir written all over it. A number of modern noir protagonists, and here there are two of them trying to become whole, are seeking some sort of life for themselves that seems to elude their grasp. Their identities are disrupted. Suicide is a viable option for them.In this movie, they lose themselves in cities, and even at the end of the snowy world, city cops find them. The change of scene is something like On Dangerous Ground.The scenario needed more work before being filmed. It's too bad there wasn't someone around to see its flaws beforehand. The writer/director didn't do another film for 9 years and then it was from a Noel Coward play.

Merrily posing through several stages of undress, Ms. Judd is a sexy serial killer. Mr. McGregor keeps his clothes on, but matches his prey in the emotionally disturbed department, as it turns out.Stephan Elliott's Eye of the Beholder is long on style, and short on substance; unfortunately, its meandering story is difficult to follow. Still, whatever director Elliott, McGregor, and Judd are doing, they often make it look good. Cinematographer Guy Dufaux excels. The film is reminiscent of director Alfred Hitchcock, especially his Rear Window and Vertigo. The supporting cast includes Patrick Bergin, veteran Geneviève Bujold, and a non-singing k.d. lang. But, Jason Priestley (as Gary) gets the best part, and turns it into the film's strongest individual performance. Mr. Priestley is startlingly convincing as a bleached blond junkie on the make. Priestley is better with Judd and McGregor than they are with each other; and, his characterization is the film's best representation of its obvious amoral intentions.***** Eye of the Beholder (1999) Stephan Elliott ~ Ewan McGregor, Ashley Judd, Jason Priestly "},{"Title":"A great movie!","Date":"12 August 2007","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" I just watched it again after many years and still love it.

By the end, sympathy increases for Joanna Eris' character while at the same time our positive regard for Stephen Wilson's character becomes confusing and dubious. It's difficult to really come away from this movie with any satisfying resolution. There is also the issue of Eris' supposed talent and ability which seems so dismal when considering Wilson's apparent ability to move in and out of the movie with so much ease.

It was very strange. Ewan McGregor did a fantastic job in his role, as did Ashley Judd in hers. There were some parts that were okay, like the scene where Ewan says something to the effect of, I'm a daddy missing my daughter, and you're a daughter missing her daddy. However, at the end where Ashley Judd dies, there should have been a more significant exchange of dialogue instead of, You took my picture at the museum. The scene would have been better if she recognized him as her guardian angel. It is also unclear why he began following her all around the United States. At first I thought that perhaps she looked like his AWOL wife, then I was unsure. In fact, I am still unsure. The memory of his daughter in his imagination was well done, and it was interesting to find out that his memories of her were seven years old. One other thing that would have been nice to know is what made Ashley Judd turn into a psycho-killer. As a last note, the scene where Ewan asks a favor of Hilary and convinces her to do it by looking cute was funny. The red coat was AWFUL-if that was what they were going for they did a good job.

McGregor plays a British surveillance expert who, while spying on the son of an official, witnesses a murder and finds himself captivated by and obsessed with the killer.  Judd plays the killer, a woman who seems to slaughter one rich man after another, changing her look at every step with a series of (occasionally ridiculous) wigs.  McGregor is haunted by the loss of his wife and daughter and Judd is damaged by the loss of her father.  So these two lost souls seem destined to wind up together, even if their agendas in life couldn't be more different.  McGregor pursues Judd all over the United States and eventually gets over his shock of her deeds and begins to protect her and fall in love with her from afar (if you can count the invasive cameras and microphones he uses on her as afar.)  Their cross-country trek includes interludes with the blind and loving Bergin, the deplorably amoral Priestley and the quasi-militant Bujold (as Judd's former probation officer.)  The film is overflowing with slick camerawork, unusual editing, sharp production design and striking costuming, but sometimes to its detriment.  These things pull the viewer out of the reality of the story and draw attention to themselves.  Tributes to previous films by directors like Hitchcock and DePalma pepper the movie, but don't necessarily add to the quality or understanding of it.  (Judd is a sort of modern-day, more-lethal Marnie and Bujold was the star of DePalma's Obsession.)  The script is deliberately obscure, leaving the audience to fill in a lot of what transpires on screen themselves.  The film rarely resembles any reality the audience is familiar with.  None of the many cities represented on screen actually feel like the said cities.  Continuously, costuming, decor, acting and dialogue suggest something other than the time and place in which the film appears to be set.  All that said, the acting by McGregor is excellent.  He conveys his character's fetishes without overacting or unmotivated mugging.  Judd is in just a tad over her head.  She does an okay job, but one can't help picturing a more dynamic actress such as Angelina Jolie (who Judd often resembles in this film) in the role.  Singer lang fails to display any particular acting skill as McGregor's inside contact.  The film is worth viewing once, to see some of the imagery and creativity on hand.  However, unless one has read the book on which it is based or listened to the director's commentary, it isn't likely to make a whole lot of sense or leave much of an impression beyond apathy.

One thing that I did tire of was his explaining the budgetary problems that he and his producers/friends had to work around.  Also, he explains why he used all the snow globes- his personal collection and also an inexpensive way to change locations in the film- even though it entirely filmed in Canada- in one city.  I later watched the movie without the comments playing- just to get the feel of it and try to understand the characters. Later, I realized that unless one has been in strained and prolonged circumstances, the average person cannot put oneself in the eye or Joanna's shoes- The average person isn't a selfish, moody, manic-depressive type serial killer nor are they an isolated, mentally-ill perverted undercover spy who's best friend is a computer and a camera.  In that case they seem to be perfect for each other.  He starts obsessing (the bathtub scene) over a woman who has been brainwashed to never rely on anyone- only herself- and she hates and uses most men. My one question is in the library scene where she glances at him on the landing- she says his name Stephen- does she know him but does not know that he is stalking her, watching over her.  We see Ewan's character slowly but methodically and convincingly cross the line of sanity when he is violent towards the people that could hurt her. He cannot have her until she is just herself and not in disguise. At the end she realized that it is he - his obsession with her causes fear and manipulation that ends tragically (or does it)- Finally with him comforting her and she wishes him her love.

This movie is weird, but I like it, strangely. It is the story of a British Embassy Detective named only Eye who follows a woman, Joanna, around. He knows she is a serial killer (she kills two men in the movie) but he falls in love with her anyway and maybe feels a connection with her because he lost his daughter and she lost her father. Well, at least I think that's the reason; they never really say why.He follows her for a span of about a year to two years everywhere she goes New York City, Utah, Alaska, and others. He interferes in her life often, saving her from people and making some mistakes too. One of the more unbelievable things is that she never notices this--she never even realizes she's being followed until a lady mentions it to her, and even then she never figures out it's him.In one truly unbelievable scene, she's walking down the street after hearing she is being followed. Instead of looking behind her, where Eye is meandering about, she looks in front of her at the people coming towards her, which makes no sense. However, we do find that she was aware of some intervention towards the end, when she says (paraphrased) she's aware she had a guardian angel but he seems to have left.One thing about this movie is that you have got to pay attention. I was reading a few reviews on IMDB and in one review you can see that the person was not very rapt in their watching. You miss the little things if you do this the realization that the phantom girl following Eye is his daughter,Lucy, and others.

It's just this one, like Heartburn, caught me off guard with the casting.  One positive, Ashley Judd always looks good with her clothes off!  For that I'll give it an extra star....er, a single star.

Ewan McGregor is completely believable in the lead, and Ashley Judd not surprisingly convinces as a female that could lead a man down a long and twisting path - as it turns out as much victim as criminal.

The director's first big budget commercial effort is an homage to Brian De Palma and his earlier work.  Ashley Judd is a gripping protagonist. Her character is a sensitive mass murderer, and the film edges on camp without actually turning on mainstream audiences, though the unrealistic incongruence should frustrate most. The director's cinematic vision is unquestionable here, though his screenwriting badly needs someone more literately inclined.De Palma's Dressed to Kill and Blowout were '70's thrillers influenced by bad movies in their sleazy subject matter, unbelievable plots, and overdone villains.  De Palma's films stuck out as art through his meticulous approach to establishing his lead characters as everyday people who are somehow trapped in the bad movie universe.  He cast Nancy Allen, Angie Dickinson, and John Travolta, and established their characters in intense soundtrack-less sequences of everyday conflict.  Once we're sucked in to the character, the film's world would enter the bizarre, the soundtrack would take over the movie, and the evil of the antagonists would enter almost mockingly absurd level.  That a bad movie could so engage us is the central issue of De Palma's movie-making.Eye of the Beholder opens centered on Ewan McGregor's character, whose law enforcement job brings him to keep an eye on Ashley Judd.  The central theme of the movie is fatalism and abandonment, at issue for both McGregor and Judd.  McGregor is separated from his daughter, who he hallucinates he is with, a hallucination so familiar that he addresses it as such.  Judd's character is repentantly violent, and an immediate appearance of bizarre camp is Judd's screaming Are you happy, Daddy? at the corpse, a phrase later explained with a flashback of her father abandoning her.While McGregor is an obsessed voyeur, Judd finds true love with a blind boring guy.  He's aware of McGregor's surveillance, and his unexpected startling of McGregor startles us. The rationale of the obsessed voyeur (which the audience of these movies actually becomes) is tenuous, and McGregor winds up killing the lover, though he tells himself he was saving him from Ashley Judd's killing streak.  Another character is introduced from Judd's past that somewhat embodies McGregor's controlling desire for Judd, and her final confrontation with Judd gives the best DePalma-esqe film strategy of the movie for inserting the highly personal into the b-suspense film universe.The plot has so many holes that the movie's success with a viewer is largely unpredictable, making the movie hard to recommend. De Palma's suspense works weren't adaptations, indicating it was the genre DePalma was naturally inclined towards.  He also had the literary project of fictionally depicting the Kennedy assassinations as haunting tragedy, a project highly compatible with suspense that culminated late in his career with Snake Eyes.Eye of the Beholder's director doesn't seem as naturally inclined to deal with suspense, and his attempts at fantasy and romance should probably be pursued outside of the suspense genre.  Still, the pacing, the filming, and the unconventional approach to a big budget movie make the film a ringing indicator for future success of this director, and I give it 9 of 10. By no means must the next effort be a suspense work.

Perhaps anger, rage, and hate best describe the feelings most people had toward Eye of the Beholder. Occasionally, though, you'll come across a review from someone who is genuinely fond of it--someone like me.I don't usually recommend it, because I don't think the issues, tone, and approach of the film are the kind the general public enjoy.  In fact, I can't even say that I 'enjoyed' it...this isn't Disneyland, it's more like abstract art.There was something indescribably true about The Eye's behavior--something about our (everyone's) destructive natures and quests for love and completion that resonated deeply with me.  The overarching sadness of the movie was beautifully poignant because, in spite of the outlandish and unrealistic situations, it touched on something very real, something hard to describe, but human in essence.If you have enjoyed movies that make you think, movies that deal with irrational passion, obsession, and the inability to escape ourselves and the consequences of our actions, then take a chance on Eye of the Beholder.As for the ending, it may feel a bit rushed and confused, but how could you ever expect anything different?In closing, let me say that the final line spoken by Joanna really made the whole movie come together for me.

You people deserve a special oscar all of your own. When I saw the trailer for this movie, I made it a note to go see it. It looked sleek, interesting, and absorbing. You can imagine my disappointment when it was none of these things.The basic plotline starts out as interesting and the directing technique and acting isn't bad at all, but who wrote this script? It felt like the writers cranked it out in 24 hours, much like college students on a paper deadline and more or less gave up trying to have the ending make any sense. Or even write an ending. It's hard to tell since the film just ends. There is no coherent flow from the last shot to the end credits. It just happens. How hard could writing an ending be? The movie was based on a book for crying out loud. The ending is right there for you! My only other thought is that some intern accidentally exposed the last reel of the film and so the ending was lost and never printed.Both Ashley Judd and Ewan McGregor are actors who are in a serious need for a good film to add to their rosters. I never really understood the hype behind Ashley Judd. She's an adequate actress but nothing exceptional. And after her failed Double Jeopardy going back to back with this pointless film, she needs something to prove to the world that she at least reads the scripts before she signs on. Her role in Eye of the Beholder as a vulnerable femme fatale was acceptable but she could have been easily replaced with someone else.Ewan McGregor has a lot of work cut out for him if he doesn't want to be forever remembered as Obi-Wan Kenobi. Something that the late Alec Guiness detested. Having this film be the follow up to the Phantom Menace could not have been helpful. His performance, like Judd's is acceptable but hardly exceptional. I won't lie and say straightout that I'm biased towards McGregor as he is or was one of my favorite actors since Trainspotting. He is well documented as being an actor who likes taking on the kinds of films that have never been done before. Perhaps he should consider WHY such films have never been done before.The rest of the cast pretty much disappears underneath the horrific script. No one really sticks out except for Jason Priestly as a peroxide blond junkie and that was only because the theater I was in erupted into laughter the minute they recognized the post-90210 actor.Overall, it's a promising concept that gets blown up by the unforgivably lousy script. See this if you are a rabid fan of either Judd or McGregor who is looking for a cure to your obsession.

It's true the storyline and photography weren't really conventional. Resembling the mind's eye, the characters move through a kind of hyper-reality that seems dreamlike because The Eye and Joanna are essentially sleepwalking through life.This wasn't ever supposed to be another Double Jeopardy.  Anyone who went into it with that preconception was bound to be disappointed.  It is instead a powerful, at times lyrical look at fractured people attempting to deal with abandonment and loss. That's it, that's the theme  allowing yourself to be victimized by your own grief.  Anyone who's ever lost anything -and I'd imagine that's all of us - can relate to that basic idea.The film is criticized for being too obvious in its psychological imagery.  To be fair, that's often a very valid point.  However, to misunderstand the film's jangling pace and texture is to lose sight of something else.  The Eye and Joanna keep moving because their pain is inside themselves and they can't escape that, no matter how hard they both try. Even running literally to the end of the world, they're still pursued by their inner demons.The ending was abrupt, and it wasn't pat.  It's not Double Jeopardy.

His love object, a beautiful but demented serial killer never even knows he is the defining element in her life until he violates the rules of their relationship to direct her actions, with unintended and tragic consequences. The viewer is in an unbalanced state throughout- the character's acts demand judgment, but they are so sympathetic and you long to know them well enough to rationalize their behavior; however, you are allowed to know nothing other than what The Eye chooses to reveal to you and that is never enough.   This film, slick and stylish, contains many coy references and subtexts, and is watchable for good performances from Ashley Judd and Ewan McGregor.  Judd is perfectly cast to neatly capture the cold, serpentine and occasionally frumpy femme fatale, Joanna.  McGregor, nimbly disappears into his role as the nerdy, withdrawn Eye with nary a trace of his usual screen charisma.  It's nice to see him doing something different. Jason Priestly is a hoot.

But the rather sad thing I'm seeing these days are films like this and In Dreams being called Hitchcock films of today.  What the hell?  Hitchcock would never have his name behind a piece of trash like this, Shallow Grave is the only thing you could even consider similar to a Hitchcock film today.  But the most important thing about comparing something like this to Vertigo or Rear Window is simply this... Hitchcock films are good.  I'll be expecting this to hit the Bottom 100 soon enough...

Eye of the Beholder is a series of set-ups, without the pay-offs.  This huge structural flaw could be looked over in a work by some technical dynamo, a director whose films have energy pouring out of them, such as music video über-director Hype Williams (possibly the greatest video director ever.), whose debut Belly, while being recut into a mess of a film (much like Eye), still had enough visual punch to fill ten films. Unfortunetly, this film is full of cheap visual tricks (which, surprisingly, don't pay off!) and unmemorable photography (an insult to underexposed cinematography, which can be used to great effect). The script is another area to blame.  The structure, as mentioned above, is a complete mess.  Characters show up out of the blue and then are given an important bit (lasting anywhere from thirty seconds to fifteen minutes) and then are disposed of just as quickly as they appeared.  This could be here to show us how the lives of our two main characters are, schizophrenic, unhinged and disjointed.  The dialogue, which is laughably bad, and the inconsistency in tone, style and even genre proves that this probably isn't the case. The editing also deserves criticism.  The jumpiness of each scene falls almost squarely on the shoulders of the editor.  Had there been a rhythm to the editing, it would be obvious that my earlier criticisms were wrong, and in fact I was watching a neo-noir masterpiece.  There is not the inkling of an editing rhythm, so we're stuck watching scenes clunk along followed by an abrupt jump to another scene which is equally bad, if not even worse. This film had a lot of possibilities.  It has the type of complex, sympathetic, borderline psychopath character (who it or they is or are, I won't say) who would fit perfectly into a great neo-noir.  Sadly, these possibilities are overlooked, and instead we get a dull, uninspired, cold, aloof and pretentious film.

I LOVE this movie. I can relate to a lot of it, personally. I love the characters, the acting, the sets and cinematography, the costuming, all of it. The music is some of the most incredible I have heard for a film. I read so many people asking the stupidest questions why did the lady parole doctor not turn her in? If you were not able to read between the lines, I'll help you out. As Joanna is not able to really have a regular, trusting relationship with a man, it makes perfect sense that she and this woman were lovers. Not to mention all the Sapphic hints that were thrown about when the doc was in the film. Genevieve Bujold was BREATHTAKING in her scenes. A powerhouse, that lady. So, when she and Joanna spot each other in the diner, that is why the tears and rush of emotion that they had to keep in check came from. Joanna kills because it sustains her. Robbing wealthy men allows her to maintain a lifestyle that also helps her stay ahead of the law. She is also able to act out her anger and frustrations toward the father that abandoned her on them. The Eye is just pathetic. Emotionally wounded, weak, mousy man too unsure of himself to just step up and do anything definitive. He feels both love and fatherly feelings towards Joanna and I believe they probably confuse him as to how to actually approach her or reach out to her, were he ever ballsy enough to actually do so. This film haunted me the very first time I saw it, and I could not get it out of my head for days. I have bought it on DVD a few times, and it is one of my go-to's. I LOVE THIS FILM. When you watch a film, listen to a song, read a book, anything having to do with the arts, there is a very important thing that you have to have the ability to use and to bring to the table suspension of disbelief. Those who point out things as mindlessly stupid as In the scene he is smoking, then when it flashes back to him, he has no cigarette. If you ask questions like this, or notice things like this, you should probably watch the Kardashians and nothing but reality garbage because I think anything with any real artistic merit is going to be beyond your level of comprehension. If you can not just allow these things to pass by (ever thought maybe he threw out the cig? Maybe he smoked it quickly?) then you are really not getting the whole point anyway. So, your watching films and things like this is probably a waste of your time as well as an insult to those who worked very hard to bring it to you. Also, not everyone likes vanilla ice cream. I am not going to force you to eat a bowl of it if you want strawberry. Same with films. Just because something was above your understanding does not mean that it did not make sense. Ever wonder if maybe you might be a little slow? LOVE Ashley Judd and the character and what she did with Joanna Eris. Loved kd lang in her small role too. This is a gorgeous film in just about every way. At least that's how I see it.

The Eye gets involved with a woman serial murderess Joanna Eris, Ashly Judd, after falling in love with her, from afar. The Eye somehow mistakes or associates her with his long lost daughter Lucy who was taken away from Steve seven years ago by his estranged wife. Lucy for some strange reason is played in the movie by two actresses who may very well be twin sisters Anne Marie & Kaihin Brown.The Eye is a bit of a recluse as he has almost no contact with the outside world with the exception of his handler or controller in the spy agency this woman only known as Hilary, K.D Lang. Hilary gets a bit annoyed and angry with him when he drops what he's supposed to do, spying and getting the goods on corporate criminals, and spends the entire movie checking out and spying on the sexy Joanna from coast to coast, and head to toe. Joanna ends up in the wilds of Alaska in this God-forsaken place called the End of the World Cafe where she's a waitress.The Eye get's to find out all about Joanne's secret life as a serial murderess when he's spying on this executive who's embezzling funds from his company who ends up being murdered by her. For some reason The Eye convinces himself that Joanna is his daughter Lucy and spends the rest of the movie following her, in secret. The Eye follows Joanna In cities as far away from each other as Boston is to San Francisco covering up about a half dozen murders she committed. In the end The Eye saves Joanna's life from this drug-addicted psycho Gary, Jason Priestley, out in the desert of Coloardo. Gary for some reason went berserk when Joanna refused to share a needle with him. The Eye trying to find out just who Joanna is tracks her secret past down to a school for troubled girls in Boston run by a Doctor Brault, Genevieve Bujold. Dr.Brault not only seems to be as unstable as Joanna but also thought her everything that she knows about being a successful fugitive from he law which she is now.Joanna who's psychotic hatred of men seems to stem from her being abandoned by her father at an early age goes through the movie murdering every man she comes in contact with. The weird and creepy Steve ,or The Eye, not only covers up her crimes but commits a number of other killings as well! The Eye gets Joanna's fiancé the blind artist Alex Leonard, Patrick Bergin, killed by blowing out his limousine tires as him and Joanna were about to drive to the local church to get married. Later The Eye brutally beats up, with brass knuckles, the wild and crazy Gary whom he locked in the trunk of his car. Then put the car on auto-pilot as it drove around in circles aimlessly with Gary left to die in the burning Colorado desert.The movie finally ends in the cold and snowy wastelands of Alaska where The Eye finally gets enough nerve to meet and talk to Joanna who's working as a waitress in this Dead End Café. After, again, saving her from getting arrested by the FBI for a number of murders that she committed only to later get shot by her when she has another one of her many psychotic fit's when she's alone with a man.It seems that the bullet that The Eye took from Joanna was either a blank or missed him entirely since The Eye immediately recovers from being shot!he then chases Joanna, who carjacked his car, on a motorcycle that just happened to be outside the shack that he was staying at. The ending is as ridicules as the rest of the movie Eye of the Beholder with Joanna surviving a car crash landing in the ice of a frozen pond with The Eye, who she just tried to murder, coming to her rescue.Battered and blooded with blood stains under her nose giving her the look of having an Adolf Hitler-like mustache Joanna and The Eye kiss and embrace each other as the movie suddenly and unexpectedly comes to an end, leaving the audience in a state of total confusion.

This film is a must see for anyone who thinks they've seen everything in films.  It makes the Usual Suspects look as complex as Rambo!The basic 'plot' (believe you me - you will never again regard that word in the same light) is about a British Embassy Investigator (Macgregor) tailing some guy being ripped off by his lover (Judd).  When the lover brutally stabs the guy to death and starts crying about Christmas(?) - thus effectively ending Macgregor's involvement - he, of course, reports her to the police...  Ha!  Had you!  No, of course he doesn't.  He follows her around America for two years instead, obsessesed and totally in love with her, but always making sure she can never see him!  I know It's genius isn't it!?  And that's the plot - on my life!Some of the twists are pure brilliance.  Like Judd loses a baby without the inconvenience of being pregnant!  And Macregor manages to fly around the entire continent of North America and stay in exactly the same hotels (always in adjoining rooms) as Judd, despite not actually doing the job the Embassy asked him to do and not reporting back to them for several months at a time!  And I won't begin to mention the bit in which Macgregor is allowed to live in a church bell tower for several months without permission!The amazing thing about it all is that the two leads really do an incredible amount with the 'magic mushrooms' inspired plot and script and Judd is particularly enigmatic and beautiful Despite turning into a psychopath because she once had a miserable Christmas as a kid!  The stylisation of the film is constantly eye-catching as well and the editing of the high-tech sound and vision is first rate and frequently very clever.  Unfortunately though - the film doesn't really know what it is or how it wants to play itself.  Elements of the already mentioned, The Usual Suspects pervade, and nods to The Sixth Sense are prevalent throughout - regrettably without a modicum of either films' intelligence.

I guess that's why so many people complained about the film being hard to follow. This is pretty normal if you are only used to be spoon-fed every plot detail. However, a real moviefan should be able to give a little thought to what is on screen while watching. For instance, many reviewers claim that the little girl simply disappears halfway through the film without any reason. Those people should be ashamed for not paying attention and then going even farther by spreading their false accusations here. Since Eye gradually gets obsessed with Joanna, the girl loses its importance in his mind and she actually threatens him not to return if he leaves to find Joanna which he does anyway. That's why the girl disappears.On the other hand, everyone is right about Evan McGregor's being miscast. The script calls for someone middle-aged so that the business with lost daughter/surrogate daughter/guardian angel topics could really click. Actually the lady at the  reception desk of the pension Joanna lives near the beginning makes that fact obvious by saying that he is her age which must be at least mid-40s judging by her physical appearance. Thus the whole above-mentioned psychological context becomes suspended in the air because looking as young as he does Eye can only be Joanna's lover, not her father and to the viewer he simply appears like a nutcase obsessed with his assignment. Ýf the creators of the film would be held responsible for anything it could only be their casting of the male lead. Every other aspect of the film, including the casting of the other lead, the gorgeous Ashley Judd is faultless. She is really believable in all her various disguises and plays the character with just the right amount of mystery. Ýt is ranked among one of her defining performances on screen. kd Lang gives her usual down-to-earth sassiness to her character and is actually the only realistic element in this film which carries a dreamy atmosphere all the time.The photography and the special effects are simply gorgeous. The cinema is first and foremost a visual medium and any film that creates a distinctive visual landscape must be considered worthy in my opinion, whatever its other faults may be. (Yes I am a defendant of style-over-content school when it comes to movies.) In this regard Eye of the Beholder is a classic consisting of beautiful imagery for all of its running time. The sound design is faultless. The use and selection of music are also wonderful, greatly enhanced by the electronic score and the haunting ballad sung by Chrissie Hynde. Last but not least, the costume design is also excellent, giving Ashley Judd an incredible femme fatale look ranging from the 30s to the 90s.I am not a litle bit modest when it comes to movies and I am sure that this film will be given cult status in the years ahead. Enjoy it.PS For those of you complaining about the ending, the alternate ending on the DVD must be satisfactory.

It's not about some strange girl, who kills people, and not about a private eye or a sleuth who tries to expose her, and not even about k.d.lang, who tries to look like miss Moneypenny. This is a mysterious film about a mysterious emotion - about a great obsession, about amok (do Stephan Elliot ever read Stephan Zweig?). Anyway, people Look closer!

Don't you see - there's so many references to Hitchcock's Vertigo, to the best works of Brian De Palma (in the small role - Genevieve Bujold from his Obsession which is also a tribute to Hitchcock). It reminds me of a great Don't Look Now. I even think that this is everything Wim Wenders' End of Violence and Until the End of the World wanted to be, but wasn't. And, hey, don't tell me that Wenders is genius, and Stephan Elliot is not. I knew that Wenders is great & unique art-house guru, but Elliot is also a cult. And you know what? There was a couple of years ago a little-seen Spanish movie Los Amantes del Circulo Polar (Lovers of the Pole Circle) by Julio Medem.

By that last question, I don't mean the screenwriter-director Stephan Elliott. From watching this pile of junk (apparently adapted from a good novel,which I have not read), I gather that either the critics who reviewed the novel must have lost their minds,or that Elliott is one of those flashy-but-empty novice directors who has no regard for the integrity of a novel,and no interest in whether or not the adaptation of that novel makes any sense. He gives us psychedelic visuals in place of plot.No---my question was addressed to the studio executives who are apparently so out of it that they actually let this film be released, and to the actors who appeared in it.Did they REALLY understand the story,or is it that the film so severely edited before release that credibility and coherence went out the window?Whatever the reason, we now have an excellent first candidate for worst movie of 2000.The film begins rather promisingly,with Ewan MacGregor as The Eye, a recluse private investigator following an apparent blackmailer (Ashley Judd) who abruptly - and this is NOT a spoiler - turns into a savage serial killer who apparently kills every man who crosses her path for more than five minutes. We are never told why--in fact, that's the film's most obvious, stupid blunder. We are never told why ANYTHING happens, and asinine twists abound in the story. Corpses and live people turn up with no explanation, and characterization, which would have answered a lot of questions in this film, is almost non-existent. The most interesting plot development, The Eye's growing obsession and ultimate protective feelings and even love for this woman he is tracking, are accounted for by the fact that The Eye's wife deserted him and took their daughter, and that Ms.Judd's character was abandoned as a child. That's all. No more explanation. We're just supposed to accept the fact that this man who even hallucinates the presence of his own daughter, suddenly falls in love with a murderer because of personal stress. And it doesn't stop there. The final twenty minutes or so are set in Alaska,where the police suddenly and inexplicably rendezvous with our nutty investigator,as well as a child psychologist (Genevieve Bujold) from the first half of the film who also suddenly turns up again with no explanation.The biggest cheat and letdown,when we finally realize we've been had, comes when the picture fades out after a ridiculously contrived climax. That's when it all sinks in that there isn't GOING to be any wrap-up which would clue us in on what happened. Maybe Elliott intended us to make up our own minds about it,but if so,he certainly botched it,and his carelessness for story structure in a thriller comes across as pure arrogance and contempt for stories---as well as for the audience.

I must have checked my watch a dozen times waiting for this monstrosity to be over. How in the hell does a movie like this get made?Let's start with what is supposed to be the plot. Ewan McGregor plays The Eye (get it?), a British Secret Service Agent. He is asked to follow the son of some rich guy to find out if the son is stealing from his trust account. While staking out the kid, he sees Joanna Eris (Ashley Judd) kill the kid. Instead of being an officer of the law and telling on her, he decides to follow her around. Apparently because the ghost of his missing child tells him to. So while Joanna (or whatever her name is at various times through the film) goes around killing people and screaming about her Daddy, The Eye just follows her around. Somehow everywhere she goes, he manages to get a place to stay really close to her, and set up various spy cameras and hidden microphones. She wanders around aimlessly going all over the United States looking for god knows what. The Eye falls in love with her and will do anything to make sure she doesn't fall for anyone else, going so far as to attack and later kill her fiancée. I have no idea what else the plot was supposed to be. I'm not even sure there was a plot. Just a lot of voyeurism and Ashley Judd wearing a lot of different wigs.This movie was crap. No two words about it, it was crap. And I get the feeling everyone who rents this will feel the same way. I should have turned it off the minute the opening credits rolled. But no, I thought, hey, how bad could it be? Well, this movie has now entered my list of the top 5 worst films I have ever seen in my life. We're talking a few thousand movies I've seen over my 25 some odd years, and this is one of the worst. I felt so sick and disgusted after walking turning it off, I had to rent Here on Earth to make me feel better. First off, the story was preposterous and annoying. Secondly, the characters had no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I was wishing they'd all die just to make the movie interesting. Third, the music was some of the worst I've heard in a film. Every so often the music would get really loud, as if they were trying to cover up the crap on film. I know this movie was made before Ashley made Double Jeopardy (and I still don't know how that movie made any money), and before Ewan became the man in The Phantom Menace. Hopefully their careers won't suffer too much because of this film. I still don't have any proof that Ashley Judd is a good actress, but she definitely has a star quality about her. Sadly, star quality doesn't help this script get any better. Every time she cried and screamed about Daddy and Christmas, I wanted to shoot myself so I wouldn't have to listen to her.There were two saving graces in the movie. One was the fact that no one seemed to talk a lot. So I didn't have to listen to Judd try and act. I think she had two monologues throughout the entire film. Oh yeah, before I forget, K.D. Lang, please stick to your day job. Like I said, I don't think Ashley Judd is that good an actress, but K.D. Lang makes Judd look like Meryl Streep. Who thought of casting her in this role? The second saving grace lasted only about 5 minutes, and that was Jason Priestly. His role as the psychotic druggie was the only decent thing about the movie. Of course he shows up late in the film, and then gets the hell kicked out of him 5 minutes later. But for every second he was on screen, he actually made the movie that much better.So overall, Eye of the Beholder, to put it bluntly, sucked. I can't believe I paid $4.75 to sit through an hour and 40 minutes of sheer hell; at least it was on my couch, and not in some uncomfortable theater seat. I would rather sit and watch Here on Earth 100 times than sit through this movie again. If you only listen to me once then listen to me now... Do not, for any reason, rent this movie. Yes, Ashley Judd gets naked, briefly, but if you want to see her naked, go out and rent the TV movie she did with Mira Sorvino about Marilyn Monroe. Eye of the Beholder was, and probably will forever be, one of the worst films I ever see in my life.

Is that about it? The few minutes I saw were, I thought, pretty well done. The director, Stephan Elliott, wrote the screenplay too and it seems he blended mystery, suspense, and action skillfully. I'd also guess it was a personal effort for him, certainly not a strictly commercial product. I saw violence, but not pornographic violence in which people have their heads wrenched off while the grinning killer makes wisecracks.Ewan MacGregor is an admirable actor. He's professional, and he's not spectacularly handsome except in a boyish and candid way. You wouldn't notice him on the subway.

She looks like the waitress she is, although I believe I might notice her on the subway. And she has no interest whatever in MacGregor except to the extent that she doesn't shoot and kill him, although the editing is confusing enough to convince us that she has. I didn't get that confrontation at all. The last scene is convincing enough though.I heard two songs, nearly complete. One did nothing for the movie, a plaintive folksy tune with lyrics by Leonard Cohen's cousin or something. It reminded me of Reba MacIntyre singing about lost dogs. The second, under the end credits, was a pretty and nicely executed popular standard. The overscore is apt and effective.It's not a cheap film. The production values are good, and the locations range from Death Valley to Quebec, and they're perfectly chosen too. Those isolated desert gas stations with a few shabby rooms in the back yard motel are rapidly being swallowed up by urban sprawl.This serial killer business is threadbare by now but I suppose every tale needs some sort of structural armature. I mean, it has to be about SOMETHING. In any case, this production looked good enough that I'd enjoy taking a crack at seeing the whole thing.

But then it gets sidetracked, the plot falls apart, and it ends, not with a bang, but a whimper.If there were any underlying logic to the plot, I might cut the filmmakers some slack. But exactly what is going on? What sort of job does Ewan have? If he's in British secret service, why is an American woman his control? And how can he just disappear with thousands of dollars worth of equipment to pursue his own obsession? What is the time line...months, years? How does he fund his private operation? The hallucinations from Ewan's past life are par for the course in psycho-thrillers, but the director seems to jettison that whole idea when it starts to slow down his plot (after San Francisco). We're supposed to make connections between Ewan's loss of his family and Ashley's loss of HER family, but is that enough to make a man whose career is in justice go on a long-term defense of a brutal killer? There are some nice visuals in this film, which is why I gave it a 2 and not a 1, but the complete crumbling of anything resembling a plot resolution makes this a worthless 2 hours. A good script doctor could have tied this up and made a satisfying thriller. However, noting that it's a Canadian production, I assume they probably had to wait too long for the doctor and gave up.

And instead of arresting her, he follows her around and becomes infatuated with her. Just like real life! And there is the possibility that he is being influenced by the ghost of the victim he was watching, but I couldn't tell for sure. And at that point, I stopped watching the movie and complained to Blockbuster about it. And the store clerk told me that I wasn't the first to complain. He gave me a free rental on another movie.This movie is an embarrassment to everyone involved with it, especially the poor people suckered into watching it.

Why is he doing that? This movie does not clearly define the actions of its people. Their behavior causes one to ponder what the blazes is going on.In fairness to the those who disliked this movie, I agree it is not entertainment in the usual sense.SPOILERS I add them here because a great many of the reviewers did not like this movie. IT is not the type for those who seek an enjoyable 90 minutes of distraction from the cares of the world.Our leading man, a spy for the British Embassy in America, is instructed to follow the son of one of his supervisors to learn what he has been up to. He sees him murdered by a woman he picked up hoping for a good time. Our leading man is somehow drawn into the web this woman weaves and does not turn her over to the authorities as he ordinarily would have. The reason he does not is for the viewer to figure out. (I prefer to leave at least a bit of mystery.) Why she kills the men who are attracted to her, and why he is obsessed with following her, one must learn from listening carefully to the dialogue. It is not thrust at you. This movie does require a bit of detective work so it is not one you can doze off on and catch up in the last five minutes.Why the woman kills men and why the hero tracks her across the better part of the USA is part of the mystery that makes this movie hard to follow and not enjoyable for many viewers. I do sympathize with you if you were expecting a feel good movie.However, after only about ten minutes into this movie I found myself sucked into it. I just HAD to know why she exhibited her homicidal behavior. How does a woman grow to possess such a latent hatred of men who want to be with her? AND, why on earth did the spy neglect to turn her over to authorities for the brutal murder of the man he was supposed to be watching out for? This movie really gets into the psychological aspects of human behavior. Why people do the things they do is a real mystery to the inquiring mind.I have given you a minimum of spoilers so as not to ruin the movie for you and to leave you forewarned that it is not entertainment in the normal sense. It is at times frustrating because you see the folly of their actions, but always it has the viewer wondering, why? Each viewer will have to ask themselves if they are content with the ending. The woman murdered several men as she moved from state to state. Will his devotion to justice force him to turn her over to the authorities? Or will his feelings for her cause him to help her avoid prosecution? Will he confess to accidentally causing the death of the man she intended to marry? (The only man she allowed to get close to her) Only you as the viewer can make that conclusion after having watched the movie in its entirety.The simple fact that viewers have such a widely varied opinion of this movie should speak well of it rather than deter one from watching it.So, pop some corn, put on your thinking caps, and be prepared for a puzzling, bumpy ride down video lane.Then later, with these few insights, come back to IMDb and let us know what you thought of this movie.

Since I was familiar with both the Sinatra and the Streisand renditions of the song, and knew the words, I could understand what the story line was attempting.This is the first movie about a female serial killer with which I am familiar , and I think for that reason it required a leap of understanding,because the lead female character was not one for whom we were likely to feel sympathy , and yet, she is hurt,vulnerable, complicated, and beautiful. The back story is that the young Joanna is abandoned by her father on Christmas. She falls under the influence of the Dr. Jeanne Brault, who is reminiscent of Miss Havisham in Great Expectations,teaching her to distrust men. Dr. Brault considers Joanna her most brilliant student, hinting that lesbianism is involved in the attraction Joanna holds for Dr. Brault. This prepares us for a psychological warp. She desperately wants security, and makes good use of her beauty and intellect to obtain what she needs from men.Stephen enters the story when he is assigned to investigate the disappearance of large sums of money from the accounts of a high official. His son has become involved with Joanna and is giving her money and expensive gifts. The beholder manages to catch them together, and photographs them. She observes that he has taken the photograph. It is at this point that the maxim that obsession, beauty, love, is in the eye of the beholder, comes into play. She sees him as her guardian angel; he sees her as a replacement for his lost daughter and becomes obsessed with her, stalking her. Joanna meets Alex,who meets all her needs wealthy, intelligent, fatherly, kind, and most important, because he is blind, unable to see her as she imagines herself to be incapable of deserving his love. She is genuinely happy and in love. Stephen shoots him. Joanna flees, but he pursues her, even in to the frozen barrens of Alaska, where she is reduced to working as a waitress. When she realizes that he is the one who took the photograph and has been the pursuer, not the angel,she flees, and has a car accident. She shoots him, not fatally. As he rushes to her side, she dies, saying, I wish you love. Which is all she wished for herself. We are left to hope that her dying wish makes him realize that he was obsessing, not loving, that he was responsible for her death, and that he can make a change in his life. I thought the use of scenery and costume, from the lavish days of the official's son and Alex to the impoverishment of Alaska, to the repetition of the Christmas theme, when the bad things happen to her, to Dr. Brault's ultimate act of love in warning her, and to have her hunted and dying like the frightened animal that she was within, in the frozen wasteland was very effective. I thought Stephen should have been played by an older actor, however, to make the obsessive transition from his lost daughter to Joanna more believable. But perhaps the makers meant to convey that Stephen was seeing her as the stunted child she was. I knocked off a point for music which drowned out dialog. I found that the movie stayed with me long after I had watched it. I had not read the book, which I think was an advantage.

Now you may think these are some stupid concept to mix together in the opening scenes of the film. Fortunately it is a very intelligent use of symbols it is masterly and poetically wielded all the way through. There is no plot, there is only imagery, and the imagery provide the contents of the film. You have to understand imagery and concepts like eudipus figure this film out. My English teacher once told me that the Lord of the flies was actually all about symbolism and that it tells of the destructive repulsive nature of man, according to the writer.For example when a car crashes through the snow of a frozen lake, and there is a lot of suggestions of blood, father and daughter, you are in for a film that uses image is more than action.Now the last bit of my summary is only for people who have seen the film, or it will ruin the film. I think that the film is mostly about the subject of child molestation. I think that the girl killing guys right after the weird initial scenes seems to present strong symbols of this subject.

Okay, it isn't THAT much of a mystery. It is, I have to admit, a very strange film that really does NOT pander to mainstream tastes in any way. But ultimately the problem is that people do not like to think about movies. When a film doesn't answer every question it poses, it gets deemed the worst movie ever made, and thus no-one else goes to see it, because, quite frankly, who'd want to watch a film that got only a 4.4 user rating on IMDb?Well, there's a number of very good reasons to watch this film. I just wish more people could realise that.First of all, it gives that brilliant and utterly gorgeous Ashley Judd a chance to FINALLY show us that she can act far better than the J.Lo's and Sandra Bullocks that she always loses out to. She has been brilliant in every role I have seen her in, but it was such a joy to see her being brilliant in a role that deserved her brilliance. Secondly - yes, this film is enigmatic, but it WORKED as an enigma. Stephan Elliot, Ewan McGregor and Ashley Judd all brought such style and emotional complexity to the film - McGregor and Judd through their understated and moving performances, Elliot through his stunning and classy direction. If you expect it all to make perfect sense, then you'll hate it, and all its stylistic brilliance will be missed. But if you accept it for what it is, then you can't avoid noticing how well done it is.Thirdly, it does actually have an intriguing and interesting plot, just not a conventional Hollywood narrative. I admit that, at the moment (I only saw it two days ago), I don't really understand what happened. But I am sure that it would benefit from multiple viewings, and I know that the way in which it affected me emotionally more than compensated for any confusion that I suffered.If anyone can actually bother with this film (ie. THINK about it, perhaps watch it more than once, willing to witness something challenging, not pre-digested for ease of mainstream consumption) and can still hate it, DESPITE the brilliant acting, editing, cinematography, soundtrack (I haven't heard Massive Attack used so well in a film-score before) and overall ambience created by all these things coming perfectly into place, then, well, I'll let you hate it, and, which is more, I'll take my hat off to you.

But every time I passed it at the movie store, I would also move and pick another Ewan movie. I just finally saw Eye Of The Beholder and I'm still trying to tie up the loose ends. Don't get me wrong- Ashley Judd and Ewan McGregor both did the most amazing acting job I've seen in both their careers. Also the movie itself, what you can understand of it, was really quiet good. There was just far to much that was not explained. I eagerly waited for the end, thinking that it would bring me some answers. That's not the case. Over all I would give the movie 8/10, but you definitely have to follow closely to everything, so if your looking for a leisure movie this isn't it.

I can safely say that it has frightened me off pursing a career as a film maker (for now anyway), given the awful stresses Elliot went through just to get the damn film completed, let alone the world of pain he then endured getting it completed and released.  Sadly, the end result shows the scars of its difficult gestation, with many of the more intriguing moments depicted in Gardiner's documentary (such as a surreal sequence involving a flooded car and another where Ashley Judd performed a bar scene heavily intoxicated) left on the cutting room floor.The cutting and re-shooting (with Elliot standing in for Jason Priestly in some shots) dulls the edge of an admittedly intriguing study of obsession and guilt, as a deeply haunted surveilance expert (Ewan McGregor) pursues a murderous young woman (Judd) across America, letting his already tenuous grip on reality slip away.There's a terrific cast on show here, with brilliant work from McGregor and Judd, but the scenario ultimately becomes increasingly frustrating and tired.  Still, if you've seen Killing Priscilla you'll be thankful Elliot got the film completed and released at all.  Here's hoping he gets the chance to do a director's cut one day.

I think I know why. Either they dislike it because they don't understand it, which usually causes irritation and a general downward outlook of a film, or the fact that it doesn't have killing, action, and sex throughout it's line. That's the only thing people want to see nowadays. They're too impatient to sit through a movie, figure it out, USE THEIR BRAINS. If it doesn't explain itself, then it's not worth seeing.Obviously, a lot of people who commented either didn't see the alternate ending or didn't finish watching the movie. The girl Ewan's character sees is NOT his dead daughter (since his daughter is NOT DEAD), only a representation of his own mental anguish at not being able to see her.I agree, however, that Judd's acting was terrible. It was. But Ewan's was perfectly fine. Compare his role in this movie to his other movies and you'll see.This movie was made to illustrate obsession, which it does to a fine degree. I guess people don't understand that one can be obsessed without ever making contact with their obsession. Can't you see it in the character?And as for Jason Preisley being the best part of the movie, I can hardly call that comment valid. Was it exciting for you because it showed the naughty side of life? Did you actually ENJOY seeing the girl getting beaten? Sure, the character was meant to possibly spark a bit of flavor into the film, but an entire movie revolving around his character would be crap, and you know it.Sometimes I hate society's narrowmindedness.

But that's it. The story...is there a story? Is about a surveilance expert who becomes obsessed with a serial murderer after seeing her kill someone. He feels a connection to her because he lost his wife and daughter because he's too into the isolationism of high tech equipment and Judd's character was abandoned by her father. What follows is just plain imagery not connected by logic, story, or character development. What makes it even more annoying is that director Stephan Elliott thinks he made an awesome film. NO! Maybe on a technical level it's kind of cool because the editing and use of CGI was kind of neat to look at. The costuming was neat to look at, but I keep feeling like I missed something.

The use of music, for example, is pretty lousy.  While the subject matter is weird and haunting, the score seems to be trying to convince us that we're watching a straight-to-video action flick starring Steven Seagal.  And the supporting character played by K.D. Lang I could GLADLY have done without.Well, what of it?  The story is still haunting, and one or two less than perfectly graceful touches aren't enough to prevent the film from being good.  Elliot manages to sustain a comfortingly eerie mood throughout an intriguing story.  Ewan McGregor is convincing and sympathetic as a grief-stricken man whose social skills have atrophied with disuse (we sense that he could still be charming if he tried, and practised a bit first), who finds himself stalking a woman he doesn't know and probably isn't even in love with, for reasons that aren't easy to explain but which make some sense to us, as well as to him.  His quarry is a criminal and walks through civilisation without being a part of it.  As a professional spy, so does he.The little voice warning him against his obsession takes the form of the ghost of his child.  We don't know whether the ghost is really there, a hallucination, a metaphor of some kind, or all three at once - and it makes no difference.  How could a film with touches like this be all bad?P.S.  The film is also useful as an argument-clincher.  There's a debate, or a potential debate, over certain films as to what their correct titles are; one view is that the correct title is whatever appears on screen.  This seems to be the IMDb's position, and it's wrong.  The correct title of Sunset Boulevard is NOT Sunset Blvd.  The correct title of Dr. Strangelove does NOT include the words, or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.  (The word or is traditionally used to suggest an alternative title, not to give a second part of the one title; if we take it seriously in this instance, then Kubrick's film has two separate titles.)  The correct title of the fourth Star Wars movie is The Phantom Menace, not the verbal monstrosity offered by Lucasfilm with two colons and a Roman numeral.  The correct title of Steven Spielberg's latest film is A.I. - those two letters and nothing more.The title card of Elliot's film appears as follows we see a close-up of someone's eye, and next to it, the words, of the Beholder.  Anyone who insists that a film's correct title is whatever appears on the screen is forced to maintain either that the film's correct title cannot be spoken - cannot even be written without hieroglyphs - or that the correct title is really of the Beholder, which is just silly.

It's sort of billed as a thriller about a murderess and a man who is obsessed with her, but it doesn't have the fast pace and the same level of gruesome violence that many popular thrillers have these days. It's really a much more thoughtful and slower paced film that's more about obsessive attraction and loss than it is about murder or anything like that. I was surprised how much I liked it. It really should have been marketed to an art house audience and not a mainstream theater audience.The movie was nicely shot. The characters were interesting people on the edge of insanity. Ewan McGregor's portrayal of a man starting to lose his mind was subtle, but convincing. It wasn't the raving madman stereotype you see so often in movies. The emphasis on the characters' astrological sun signs was an unusual and refreshing touch. The movie didn't go deep enough into astrology to really explain their motivations, but if you know astrology, you will see that the characters did reflect some of the keywords associated with their sun signs. As a student of astrology, it was really fun for me to see an astrological theme in a movie. By the way, in case you don't really like violent movies (as I don't), close your eyes through the one pretty gruesome scene near the beginning of the movie, and the rest is not that bad.

I thought the plot flowed smoothly and both McGregor's and Ashley Judd's characters had depth and I sympathized with them.  Ashley Judd plays a woman, Joanna, disturbed from the abandonment of her father when she was young and she becomes somewhat of a criminal (to say the least) because of her confused childhood.  Ewan McGregor plays a detective under the alias The Eye who is sent to find her and he ends up following her all across the country.  The more he watches her, the more he wants to protect her because he sees that she is scared and needs help.  He is also a lost soul because his wife had left him, taking his daughter with her.

In many other films, especially so-called thrillers like Double Jeopardy, the only explanation for the irrational behavior of the characters is the movie would be over too quickly if they behaved like normal sensible people. But in this case, the irrational behavior of the main characters is the actual theme of the movie. The whole point of the film is that Ewan's Eye character, a detective specializing in complicated surveillance, is a sick, obsessive man having a nervous breakdown. He becomes obsessed with an equally psychotic woman who has lost her father, as he has lost a daughter, and he becomes her twisted guardian angel by identifying her with his daughter. (This would be clearer if an older actor were used; otherwise the audience assumes he has the hots for her.) The only similar film I can recall is Vertigo, which can be loosely described in some of the same terms--a film less interested in the formula of a thriller plot than in the demented psychology of the detective. This idea is both daring and unpleasant. (Hitch is one of the names the director thanks at the end, and there's a shot of an eye-shaped stairwell that might be a nod to the opening credits of Vertigo.) It's shot with such excessive style that I assume the director has experience with music videos, and that's part of the fun. The movie may not be a classic but it's much more intriguing and unusual than a lot people say. Obviously not for all viewers, but then no movie is. Shall we say not for most viewers?

Plus, more importantly, it's a great character exploration.  While other people have noted that the characters almost never talk about what they're doing or why they're doing it and are also rather expressionless (which is very much in character for both of them), the movie uses a different means of revealing character  it allows the characters to do absolutely anything. SPOILER ALERT Thus, you learn about who the Eye is not through the explanation at the end but moreso from what he does  abandons his job, escapes his daughter's memory, puts his life in danger, shoots at the police, even commits two homicides, one of which is not remotely justifiable.  These show that he is protective of and jealous for Eris, and that there is no limit to what he'll do for her; few hollywood heroes have been able to prove their emotions so fully.Basically, I'd say that it's the story of someone who is already outside the law (for his job) and who takes a step further and becomes a law in and of itself.  There have been a lot of stories where heroes have done this for revenge or for their perception of the good of society.  Here he does it for himself and for a woman he loves (in his own sick twisted way).So I wish this film were better, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who didn't know what they were getting into, but it is very different, and as such I'd rather watch it than a better plotted film which is just like films I've seen before.The one film I would compare it too is also very flawed  Romeo is Bleeding.

And let's face it, it's not so surprising that so many people just hated it and didn't even bother to appreciate what a great piece of art this film really is. This is really artistic freedom at its best. After all, which movies always make most money?Probably most people who saw Eye of the Beholder only did so because they had seen some pathetic film like Star Wars Episode I - the Phantom Menace. But Eye of the Beholder, was just not made for this narrow-minded audience, who enjoys itself with high-tech Hollywoodian explosions like every couple of seconds.Well, let's put it this way, it might not be the greatest neo-noir film ever made, but it does have its great moments. With a limited budget of $11M, I'm sure director Stephan Elliot did some great miracles - the camerawork is just brilliant, and so is the score, but of course this might be too artsy and way too much unconventional for the narrow-minded mainstream movie-viewers. I cannot blame them though. Frankly, it does have some big grey areas too, like we're never actually told why Eye's (McGregor) visions of his lost child Lucy stop half-way through the film and why he becomes so obsessed with Joanna Eris (Dudd), the femme fatal of the movie, and more important than this, the ending is totally ambiguous. But again this is all left to our own imagination. Why should everything be so spoon-fed anyway?Perhaps, if you rent the DVD and watch the movie with the director's commentary throughout the whole film after seeing it for the first time, you'll be able to appreciate it even more.  Unlike what some people said that this film takes place over a span of 10 years, it's actually 3 years - Stephan Elliott says so in the beginning.If your favourite movie is 28 Days, please do everyone a favour, and just don't even bother watching Eye of the Beholder, as you'd be wasting 100 minutes of your time and bucks on the rental. If you enjoyed every second of The Lost Highway and any other bizarre movie in the same vein, then this one is just for you.

Sometimes I can appreciate it when a movie doesn't explain everything, but thrillers like this need to be well-oiled machines.  This movie's plot positively clunked along, with large gaps in it big enough to drive a truck through, and no real resolution to provide any sort of satisfaction to its audience.  It's like some kind of rebellion against logic.   The movie stars Ewen MacGregor as an extremely reclusive operative for the British Secret Service, known in the film only as Eye, who is assigned to follow and gather evidence against an executive who has possibly embezzeled millions from his company.  When we first see him observing his target, we are startled to see that he has brought his young daughter along for the ride.  But soon, when Eye is approached by a police officer, we are given a point of view from the officer's perspective, and are even more startled to discover that Eye's daughter is not actually present, except in his own mind.   But I digress.  Eye follows the executive to his home, where he has taken an attractive woman with him (Ashley Judd) where they engage in what looks like a kinky sex game, until (read no more if you want to be surprised) to Eye's astonishment, she kills the executive in a particularly violent way, and goes down to the lake to wash the blood off herself in the rain in a scene that sets the tone for Eye's observation of her later on.   From then on, Eye follows this woman, who remains nameless throughout much of the movie, acting in some ways as a father figure, and in others as a guardian angel of sorts. He bails her out of trouble again and again, never seen or heard.  She seems to have a sense, somehow, of his presence, but how does she feel about it?  The movie doesn't explore this very much, and only very late and with a paltry line or two of dialogue does it even acknowledge it.  We get many scenes in which Eye watches this woman closely, and are never given a distinct reason as to why.  There is the sense, perhaps, that he is trying to replace his missing daughter in some way, to fill the void she left behind.  We see him protect her from the law as she kills again and again.  Is he attracted to the danger she poses?  We don't know, and frankly, neither does the movie.  What about the fact that Eye keeps seeing his daughter in his mind everywhere he goes?  Is he mad, or does he just miss her terribly?  No answers there, either.   Movies don't have to provide all the answers, all of the time, but they should throw us a bone once in a while.  The character's motives remain a mystery to us, and as they act time and again in ways that are contrary to what we know about them, it is a distraction, because we are left scratching our heads and trying to figure out what the hell is going on.  I enjoyed the performances themselves from MacGregor and Judd (who is one of the best actresses on the screen today), and I liked Eye's contact at headquarters, played with a sardonic charm by K.D. Lang, who is incredulous as we are as to why Eye doggedly pursues his target for so long.  But the movie left me feeling hollow.  It has the dubious honor of accomplishing a strange and wondrous thing it made me feel like I knew less about its characters coming out of the movie than I did going in.  It's like eating Chinese food and feeling more hungry afterward than you did before.

Problem is that Ewan MacGregor's character is very nearly insane, as is the person whom he is watching, Ashley Judd, who has a thoroughly unexplained black widow character. The beholder (MacGregor) has lived his life hiding and never quite touching anyone, finds a wonderful way to have a relationship by just watching Judd, a kind of emotional voyeurism. The beheld (Judd) has spent her life hiding from all eyes, using wigs, makeup, changes of address, etc, so that no one will ever be able to touch her emotionally -- maybe. He follows her around the nation, from east to west to south to north, but nothing much ever really happens.

The most memorable scene was Ashley, naked, (which would normally pique my interest) and covered in blood saying Merry Christmas Daddy.  We never know what has damaged her so severely that she is driven to kill.  And the hallucinations MacGregor's character experiences are extremely annoying and contribute nothing to the story.With a horrendous script, actors that sleepwalk through their roles, a plot that dissolves into a disjointed mess and a frighteningly stupid ending, there is nothing that would make me recommend this movie.

It might hurt us a bit when we watch a movie and involve in finishing it to have nearly nothing at the end ! You'd feel disappointed as well as deceived for the loss of your time, money, caring. Surely it hurts also our own intelligence's dignity.Sometimes it happens with me when I see some alleged films that their conceited distant creators thought themselves genius prophets, making non-comprehensible great films which are so great only because nobody understood it at all !!. And sometimes I don't grasp a movie's meaning weather because of my bad viewing or my low experience or culture. It's provoking anyway. But here.. It was another story ! It's a kind of situation where the doctor is ill by the very disease he was busy in diagnosing it !!, and I mean by doctor the writer/director (Stephan Elliott) ! How is that ?.. Let us see..Mainly the film is about the mania. In one hand we have one maniac mysterious female who kills any man got fascinated by her beauty and wanted her body only. And on the other hand there is one maniac investigator who lives absolute craze about the first character out of his great obsession with her image. Their mania leads to real bloody, brutal and merciless events for both of them. Like it's some kind of hopeless case of addiction with a dark end unless they could see anything would save their madness, or heal them (creative reasonable love possibly). You can summarize the film completely by a brief situation of it ; when you watch that guy who follows (Joanna) from an alley to flirt with her, not seeing at the same time a rushing fast car that hits and crushes him. His eyes were mad about something that blinded him, which led to his end.The story tried to say all of that in a form of a noir film. There is a pursuit of a killer and the impossible love story that made the good chaser a killer himself (he killed the blind rich man in an intentional way, and maybe he killed the road's rapist). In the same time it's a story about a father who is missing his daughter and a daughter who is missing her father. Of course it's a catchy unique story for everyone out there. But the final result was something totally else ! You'll have such a huge amount of confusion and muddle while it, feeling that it's nothing but an enigma more than a movie, and it's that inscrutable to the extent that you'll quit thinking about a lot, and I mean a lot, of numerous provoking details !  the repeated statue ?. the hints in the places names ?, the real story of the lost daughter and is she the one in the picture or not ??, the symbolism in hiding in a church ?! , the secret of Joanna's mania of killing ?, the actual relationship between Joanna and the doctor ?, the reason why the eye planed to has himself killed (fake killing) by the hands of Joanna ? .. And I have a personal wonder about the agency which the eye was working for ? It was so advanced, so obscure like we're in a futuristic sci-fi movie ??!! This film did all of that (and more !) because simply the creator himself was maniac ! Yes my dear ladies and gentlemen he was infatuated by his own manifesto about infatuation !, presenting spellbound characters by spellbound writing and directing which led to all of this fall, this pure lousy vagueness, and this original silly time, so much that I said to myself after such a concentrated devoted watching and thinking It's In The Abdomen Of The Poet !; it's an old saying we have which means in Arabic that nobody will understand the actual meaning of the poem except its poet. So (Stephan Elliott) attempted to make one ambitious different film with good idea about mania which comes from the absence of love, so how it would devastate the person by blinding him. Howevr, what a case indeed when the making of the film expresses the same idea to have the creator destroying his own creation by focusing on things or thing he is the only one who sees (like his character !) to make a film with meanings maybe you'll get it whole understandable only in the Abdomen of Mr. Stephan Elliott ! There could've been another distinct fate for it if its writer wasn't its director, or the opposite. At that point I think somehow this movie would've been something much powerful as a work done by more than what one EYE could see and reach. So not to be that maniac or that obsessed in love to ruin your own love itself, the way Stephan Elliott sorrowfully did here with his very film.

The disappearance of her father effected her whole life mentally, socially and always on the move. She is a woman that trusts no one, a hardened soul but you sense her child like, silent, lonely existence. The determination of Ewin McGreggor, the father, to find her is his quest but guilt, disappointment and sadness ultimitely develops into an obsession - as though playing out his own movie. This is also a film that is unforgettable and allows for one's own interpretation. There is unpredictibility at every turn which heightens the suspense as you long for more.

Thankfully, I did it as a spur of the moment thing, and saw it for myself.Granted, the film has a number of logical flaws in it. For example, the two scenes, one in the museum where Eye first photographed Joanna and the one where he first witnessed her committing murder, are for me grossly inadequate in explaining how he became so obsessed with her.I did, however, enjoy the quirky character of the reclusive Eye.  His psychological problems are barely hinted at in the beginning, though it became far too contrived for my liking, and Eye managed to fall neatly into that stereotypical mold of a failed father and husband.  In a way, there is a sort of consistency in his character, since he is some type of a surveillance expert in the espionage business, and his single-mindedness in pursuing Joanna is in line with his trade.  At the same time, however, his geekish and rather clumsy outlook somehow fails to convince me of his ability to carry out the cross-country, high tech surveillance exercise that he embarked upon.Joanna's dark side is, of course, never truly explained.  We are told that she had a troubled childhood, that she had suffered great losses in her life.  She was taught to protect herself, to never reveal her true self to any man.  While it explains her constantly being on the move and her various forms of disguises, any relationship between this background information and how she became a murderess is tenuous at best.  Since the entire film is based on the characters of Eye and Joanna, and their interaction thereof (rather, their non-interaction), the great logical gaps that exist in these characters simply can not be ignored.What there is of a plot is very linear, which should have made it easier to guess what is going to happen next, but disorganized enough to make you wonder how one scene leads to the next.  Eye sees Joanna.  Eye follows Joanna.  Eye falls for Joanna.  One never quite manages to discern what spurred him on.  Though I suppose that is the darker definition of obsession, and perhaps the director chose not to dwell on the reason of the obsession.  The different men in Joanna's life, however brief the encounters, cuts the plot up into tiny chunks, each having no more relationship with another than the fact that the law, be it the local police or the FBI, seems to be in perpetual pursuit of her.  There is little sense of continuity, and it is difficult, though not impossible, to empathize with Joanna for the sense of permanent dislocation from mainstream society that she must feel.In the end, it is perhaps merely a simple story of two lonely people, one a spook and the other a crook, isolated from mainstream society, who see the possibility of finding happiness and living normal lives.  Their paths crossed, yet at all the wrong times, and they never quite manage to find each other to look for that happy ending.

If there must be a point to the movie, perhaps it is the most obvious one, and the results of the voting and comments here, lean toward that old saying.  Beauty is in the Eye of the Beholder.I understand that Stephan Elliot had some pretty serious financing problems, and even so I think this is an original, daring, and intriguing piece of work.  I'm not one that believes that a movie must have a specified point to be worthy. Furthermore, Films that attempt to hammer down specific themes limit thought and interpretation.EYE OF THE BEHOLDER creates a dream like atmosphere through, masterful pacing, and directing.  The soundtrack works and the acting is air tight. I thought that even the one-line characters were well portrayed.So if you haven't seen it, please don't follow the crowd blindly, but see it and decide for yourself.

Right from the get go it was clear this film was trying to sidestep the typical formula and milk a little freshness out of that cow.  Well, that and some so-so editing and scene transition effects are all this one trick pony can pull off. Let's start with the non-existent story.  Ewen McGregor plays this investigator guy for some agency.  This is never clearly defined - more on that later.  While investigating Ashley Judd (why?  never explained) he sees her waste this guy.  And of course, just before she does the deed, she whips out the plastic tarp for all the blood so we see it coming a mile away.  After this he develops an obsession for her and follows her around several cities.  Why?  Never really explained.  See, Ewen lost his kid at some point.  And after Ashley stabbed this guy about forty times she said something like oh daddy daddy daddy.  And after that Ewen starts following her around.  Some other stuff happened, I think.  I think Ewen McGregor drank coffee at one point.  I think the coffee may have been the climax of the film.  Who knows?  Who cares?Remember how I mentioned Ewen McGregor works for some agency but we don't know what it is?  Okay, I can accept that.  It's not central to the plot, right?  Who wants to hear the same old I work for a super-secret government agency bit anyway, right?  The problem is that *nothing* about him is ever clearly defined.  Everything from his job, his motivations, his past, etc. are all cast aside as things we're expected to make assumptions about. Judd is the same murky deal.  Her father abandoned her, that's what we know.  Now she kills people and steals.  How she went from one to the other...?  We get scant few clues.  Next thing we know we're taking logical leaps of faith over the grand canyon just to keep watching this mess.We never get inside the characters' heads.  In fact, quite the opposite, it's almost as if the story intentionally keeps us staring through the fog.  The daughter as a device to show the obsession was a good idea.  But talk about repetition.  At best her use was mediocre and god-awfully repetitive.Finally we have the psychiatrist.  I'll take a stab here and guess that she was thrown in by the producers midway through the shoot who realized that unless they put in at least one character that could explain a few things this film would be an utterly incomprehensible pile of poo.  Nice try, didn't work.  Why?  Because they made her a bowl of split pee soup, too.  What are her motivations?  Who knows?  Her first scene played like a tribute to the warden in Chained Heat.Gah, it's just too awful.  Is it the worst film ever made?  No.  Breakfast of Champions and the Corey Haim Video Diary still own that and Ashley Judd runs around in skimpy outfits a few times which is worth something.  Other than that, this is an awful awful film that Ewen McGregor can add to his increasing list of ca ca films along with that Velvet Goldmine freakish nitemare thing he also did.

The film makes the viewers obsessed with thinking about ways to pass the time, without falling asleep. It's tough I'll tell you that.Ewan McGregor plays a nameless private eye, who is actually called Eye in the credits. Eye becomes obsessed with a female murderer (Ashley Judd) while he is on a mission.  The movie brings you right into the whole thick of what is going to happen...nothing. Beholder goes absolutely nowhere, I mean I really didn't think it was possible to make a film with a plot this thin.  There really wasn't one.  Let's see if I can get what I can somewhat conceive is suppose to be the plot.  Eye chases Judd's character across the U.S. watching her kill people one after another for no apparent reason.  He just follows and she doesn't notice.  After a while you can tell that Eye has just stopped trying when he begins to watch her by standing right in front of the window. No more high-tech equipment to keep him from getting caught, he just sticks his mug up against the window and watches.Also, Eye has a lot of inner tension and a problem with grasping reality at times because he talks to a little girl phantom, who he thinks is his real daughter.  The film doesn't try to go a little more in depth on this subject they just brush the top and go back to the pointless chase. I guess Elliot was trying to pull off a surreal character study. But he never really showed too much character development and he has so much, of nothing, in the film that he couldn't go in depth on anything.  It was just pointless scene after another leaving the viewer with many many unanswered questions.  But after you leave the theater you don't want to do anything but make fun of the film because you are in absolute shock that such a pointless and pasted together film could land some big stars and a wide release. Always try to leave with something positive, so I will say that Beholder is inspirational in some ways.  Future screenwriters watch and realize that basically anything can be made into a film, you just need a lot of luck...and Jason Priestley, who had a terrible little part in the film.  Also I think that we may have found the perfect cure for insomnia because thin dialogue being poorly delivered in a plotless film will put, just about, anyone to sleep.3/10  "},{"Title":"not dark enough, not thrilling enough, not enough","Date":"4 February 2015","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" Stephen 'The Eye' Wilson ((Ewan McGregor) is a loner investigator for the British Consulate in Washington. He is assigned to investigate an official's son and witnesses Joanna Eris (Ashley Judd) killing him. He suffers from hallucinations of his daughter whom he lost in a divorce. His hallucination convinces him to protect the wayward serial killer and start following her.The movie needs better style from director Stephan Elliott. It's not dark enough to be compelling or paranoid. It's definitely not tense enough to be thrilling. The movie sets up the premise but does few exciting things with it. It has a Hitchcock feel but lacks his expertise. Even the surreal element of his hallucinations need some help. They're not unreal or fanciful enough. This could be something worthwhile if it isn't so unimaginative.

To say the plot is full of holes is a colossal understatement, the plot is nonexistent. If an alien mother-ship had shown up in the latter half of this film and beamed Joanna on board it would not have been any more nonsensical or out of keeping with what had gone before than the stuff which actually happened. If this was a painting it would be classified as surrealism.One final problem, this is a movie about a deranged serial killer and the deranged person who is helping that serial killer escape capture. As it happens the deranged serial killer is a beautiful woman, which apparently makes all the difference. It's hard to imagine this flick ever being made if it had involved a male serial killer of women getting away with his crimes and the audience being asked to sympathize with him.That said, Judd and McGregor both did an excellent acting job considering what they had to work with. And it was very well filmed. And lots of cool older model cars make brief cameo appearances. So three stars.

OK, he looks like a complete douchebag and then he actually(but unsurprisingly) physically thrashes her after she refuses to do heroin with him.

This voyeuristic spy thriller covers thousands of US miles, including all the major cities, yet it goes nowhere. For a while, the story is interesting, but it gets progressively less so. Eye of the Beholder, is pretty ambitious, but it's not actually that smart. What we get can be interpreted as Vertigo plus Rear Window updated for the late 20th century, or as a hundred minute man hunt that is dressed up look fancy. Either way, the movie is not that appealing, and furthermore it is far too long (or it feels that way). This is one of those movies that you are kind of eager for the end to come, because having never gotten to be a part of it, you are just a viewer in the audience watching shallow characters run around on screen. Neither Ewan McGregor nor Ashley Judd can bring much life to their roles. What is ironic though is that even when the ending comes, you may find yourself frustrated, because it's abrupt and lame, and leaves so much unanswered. Eye of the Beholder, is a film that misfires. It attempts too much, and leaves out important ingredients like intellect, dimension, and thrills/chills. I don't think I can recommend it.

And the other is a director of an Oscar-nominated film Priscilla Queen of the Desert? For a better answer to that watch the documentary about this film called Killing Priscilla for a better understanding and see how the film slowly slipped through Elliot's grasp. But that is for another criticism and this is for this film... The problem is not entirely Ashley Judd's fault. Nor is it Ewan McGregor's. But more exactly it is the fault of having both of them in the same film and portraying a father and daughter. If one is to take the pro-Judd choice in this film, then she does a exceptional portrayal of a lecherous woman that is conflicted with what she wants, and what she is trying to recapture due to the absence of her father in her past. Plus she gets naked too!!! Instantaneous high-fiving. Con-Judd though is that her character is too underdeveloped as far as her father abandonment issues and how her manipulation as a youth has transformed her into a woman that knows no love, only materialism. But she still is naked in the film and that is solidified! Now onto McGregor... pro-McGregor is this guy can channel isolation into depression and obsession just by raising his brow. He does it so void of any human emotion that he is a shell and his search of this woman, that may-or-may not be his daughter, seems to give him his sole soul that he has lacked for some time. Con-McGregor is the age of his character. If he is chasing a version of what would be his adult daughter then he has not aged a day since he quit the junk in Trainspotting. And that makes it the polarizing effect on this film... this film should've been separated into a 2 hour film where 1 hour was dedicated to the Ashley Judd character's point-of-view, and the other hour should've been dedicated to McGregor's version. Having both of them together interacting is breaking a cardinal rule of time travel which is DO NOT INTERACT with the past for it might throw off the universal balance, and that is exactly what has happened with the casting decision in this film. And one final time... Ashley Judd gets naked!!!

The things that make this movie great are the acting, the directing, the artiness, Genevieve Bujold, K.D Lang, Ewan McGregor, and the best Ashley Judd. Ashley has never really acted well before but after Norma Jean and Marilyn. The only thing wrong with this movie is that it ended just when you wanted more. The book written by Mark Behm is the best book I have ever read and the movie is the movie I have ever seen. I think we should have seen more of Bujold and less of McGregor but this is s must see for any true film lover.

This is the greatest part about this movie, it's ability to keep surprising the audience. The direction from Stephen Elliot is superb with a performance from Ewan Macgregor that just gets better as it gets more bizarre. Even K.D.Lang offers us a surprisingly inciteful look into her character Hillary. All in all a tremendous movie that will never win an oscar or break a box office record and in my opinion is all the better for it.

I liked it. But while I liked the film, I also didn't like the ending(parts of which can be seen in the trailer.........)  I liked Ewan McGregor's character, as well as Ashley Judd's.  When I went to go see this movie, I already knew how the film would end.  I've also read, from an interview Ashley Judd gave, that the script had a different ending to the film.  I'm thinking that the film crew must have been running out of the money and decided to shoot the ending that now exists.  Is this the worst movie I have ever seen?  No.  I've seen worse (i.e. Godzilla, The Astronaut's Wife, Pokemon, Mercury Rising, etc....)  Will I see this movie again?  Yeah, probably when it comes out on video or DVD.  Destination Films has a deal with Columbia/Tri-Star to release their films on Pay-Per-View and video, so I am hoping the DVD edition has the alternate ending....  But anyway, yes, over all I enjoyed the film. I've read that this film is similar in theme to Vertigo.  Perhaps I will pick up that Alfred Hitchcock classic today........

I had no understanding of the detective's motivation and also didn't know the span was ten years, as no one looked any different, until I read it on IMDB.  I can't imagine how I would have felt if I'd seen it in a theater and paid full price.  Probably pretty angry.  Double Jeopardy, for all its plot holes and predictability, was extremely entertaining. There were some good and some interesting actors in this film - Judd, MacGregor, nice performance by Priestley - but they were wasted.

And that's too bad that such a  bad plot as this can tear down some fine actors like this.  Not the best film of the year, but at least they try "},{"Title":"What The Hell Is This Crap ?","Date":"9 September 2003","Score":"4 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  If there`s anyone out there thinking of making a film about a serial killer ( Yeah like we need another film about a serial killer ! ) can you please watch EYE OF THE BEHOLDER in order to find out how NOT to make a compelling thriller . You should never make a secret agent hero resemble a 19 year old trainspotter ( Geddit ? ) who has visions of his daughter ( How old was the hero when he had his daughter ? Twelve ? ) , and never ever try to disguise a pretentious arthouse movie as a commercial blockbuster . It also goes without saying you should give the characters motivation , something the makers of this crap seem to have forgotten . EYE OF THE BEHOLDER is similar in some ways to THE CONVERSATION and BLOW UP ie there all pretentious rubbish and I hate them .BTW the week EYE OF THE BEHOLDER was releasd it entered the number 1 spot at the US box office with a near record small take for a movie topping the US film charts . A week later it had dropped to number 6 . When a movie drops down the film charts so quickly in its second week of release it`s ALWAYS the sign of a really bad movie     "}]
