[{"Title":"Remarkable film with a remarkable heartfelt performance by Keanu Reeves","Date":"18 July 2003","Score":"18 out of 19 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Music, Romance","Review":"  Long before there was The Matrix, before there was a Bill and Ted, Keanu Reeves starred in Permanent Record, a movie that inexplicably has gone unnoticed. Permanent Record is a wonderful, moving, touching film about how one deals with those tragedies in life that have no explanation, and no matter how much we ask Why?, we know there will never be an answer to that question.If you have never seen this film, my recommendation would be that the first time you view it, you watch it cold without knowing anything about what is to take place.  That would mean not reading this review or any of the others posted here.  After you have watched the film you will understand.  The film begins as if you are watching any other film about teenagers, high school and their day to day lives.  The two main characters are Chris (Keanu Reeves) and David (brilliantly portrayed by Alan Boyce), who are good friends.  They play in a band together for which David is writing the music.  David is a straight A student whom seems to have everything going for him.  He is popular, he has been accepted into a major music college, he has a very loving, caring, wonderful set of parents (played by Barry Corbin and Kathy Baker), a younger brother who looks up to and admires him and a beautiful girl friend.  Yet, we begin to see little things that hint there is something wrong in David's life.  The first time you watch Permanent Record, like his family and friends, you may not even notice that things are not as perfect for David as they seem.  We see the signs, but we ignore them or overlook them.  It is not long until one fateful night a tragedy occurs that will forever alter the way Chris along with his friends and classmates view their lives.  We are there when it happens, along with Chris, yet like Chris, we don't actually see the event occur. At first, as Chris does also, we are sure it must have been an accident.  We soon find out it was not.  Instead David's family and friends are only left with questions   How could this happen when David seemed to have everything going for him?  Why did it happen?  Couldn't they have seen it coming?  Shouldn't they have been able to stop it from happening?  They are questions for which there will never be any answers, not for us not for them.  They must come to terms with what happens, without ever understanding.  In the end that is what Permanent Record is about.  There are so many things that happen in life which will be beyond our understanding or reasoning.  We may look back angrily when we think about it, as Chris and his classmates surely will, as they learn their own lives are changed forever.Keanu Reeves gives an emotional depth to his character that I have never seen him bring to any film since Permanent Record.  He has all the characteristics of a typical High Scool boy down, yet we are able to see the pain he is going through, and we feel it as much as he does.  Alan Boyce as David, plays him with such perfection, that even when he is no longer on the screen, that we miss him along with Chris, his parents and his classmates. The last five minutes of this film are five of the most poignant minutes I have experienced in any film.  It is a scene that touches at the very heart of this film.  Though we may never understand many of the tragedies that occur in life, we remember those we have lost and the things they brought to us while they were here.  Then, in the end, we must move on.  Sometimes there just are no answers.

Well, I was right to some degree, since there is some humor in the movie, but I didn't count on the compelling story and even the fine performances. The movie is about a kid named David, who seems to have the perfect life. He has a loving family with a little brother who adores him, he is accepted to a great college, he is a musical director for the school's drama production, and his band just got the opportunity to record some of their songs. But he feels very pressured, and his best friend, played by Keanu Reeves, tries to get him to lighten up a little. What nobody knows is that David feels that he can't handle the pressure anymore. One night, at a party, David goes off to the cliffs by the ocean alone. Keanu follows, but when he goes to the area where David was just standing, David has disappeared, with nowhere he could have gone but down. Keanu's life starts going down the tubes, as he is the only one who knows that David didn't die in an accident, and that information is eating him up inside. When he finally tells David's parents, he thinks that things might start to go back to normal, but, suddenly, he is taking on the responsibilities that David has left behind, including writing the music for the band. The situation is at it's worst when Keanu is driving drunk and almost runs over David's little brother. As David's father is screaming at him for being so reckless, Keanu grabs him, starts hugging him, and, tearfully, says that he was David's best friend and should have been able to stop him. This scene literally brought me to tears, and I never would have thought that Keanu Reeves would ever be able to make me cry, even though I am a big fan of his. I think this is Keanu Reeves' best performance since River's Edge. His portrayal of this character is basically the same as his portrayal of Ted Logan in the Bill and Ted movies, but with much more emotion and depth. The dramatic scenes, like when he throws a book through the principal's window, are done to perfection. He is completely believable as a confused teenager who suddenly finds himself alone without a best friend. The movie itself is an accurate reproduction of the effects of suicide on the people who are left behind David's parents, brother, and friends. This is not a lighthearted film, but it is absorbing and actually makes you care about the characters. A definite must see.

While most high school movies center upon the superficialities of High School life, Permanent Record goes right for the guts of it, knowing that there are no easy answers, no simple solutions.As such, it represents not a single stitch of calculated drama, and doesn't even really have much of a plot, substituting that instead for a series of seemingly disconnected events that don't lead anywhere definite, but still manage to give off the distinct impression that none of the characters' lives will ever be the same as they were when the movie begins.This isn't a movie you will watch if you want to be entertained.  But it is a movie that, if you are prone to such behavior, you will be thinking about even years after having seen it.  To that end, it is virtually unsurpassed.

Jennifer Rubin's character sings a song at the end of the movie that I would love to be able to find. The singer, whether or not it truly is her, is terrific. The story line is serious, as is the movie, but anyone who wishes to see Keanu master his dramatic, sad role should definitely see this movie.

I think the guy got a bit typecast with the BILL & TED thing.  But as a man who's lost several loved ones to suicide, I found this film very true to form in its point-of-view of choice... focusing on the survivor.  Another viewer who described the film as 'terrible' I think missed the point by looking for an 'explanation' for the suicide.  After 23 years since my own mother's death to suicide, I can tell you that you never really know 'why'.  I thought PERMANENT RECORD to be a bit of subtle brilliance in its focus on the stages of healing survivors go through... those of guilt, anger, shock, and finally acceptance.  The film was made for a  modest budget but, I felt, showcased some wonderfully understated and powerfully touching moments.  Suicide is an emotionally perplexing issue.

Having lost a friend to suicide myself, I found the movie to be very honest and real in its emotion and messages.  While some of the acting was pretty B-grade, it wasn't that bad considering the obviously low budget.  AND I'm shocked to say Keanu Reeves wasn't at all bad--in fact, he was quite good (and I'm not a fan)!

In this day and age, teenage suicides happen often, and appear in the press. This is a movie, set in the 80s, and really has a powerful effect on you. To start with, I was trying to figure out why the main character decided to kill himself. It never really says. But the movie concentrates more on what David's close friends feel on his suicide. The film focuses heavily on Keanu Reeves character, Chris. He features in some of the film's most powerful scenes, and although he plays his Ted character, goofy and gangly, he really acts his socks off. He also features in an almost painful crying scene.There's a terrific song, which unfortunately isn't available. It's worked on throughout the film, but it really comes to light towards the end. It's called Wishing On Another Lucky Star, performed by J.D. Souther.This is a very powerful movie, although it didn't leave much of an effect on me. I was expecting it to leave me with something at the end of the movie, but this kinda movie has been done better in recent years - The Virgin Suicides for example.

Especially since that is really what this movie is about the process of healing after the loss of someone. I found this movie to be touching, realistic, and enveloping. Allow me to explain. I was touched by the character development. I found the process of the healing to be very realistic. And because I could identify with what some of the characters were going through, I found it enveloping. Some of Keanu Reeves best work is in this film. Chris' breakdown in the Dad's arms is one of the best scenes in the whole film. On top of all that, to this day, when Jennifer Rubins sings at the end, I cry. Every time. Now, whenever I need a pick-me up, I sing that song.On a side note, I would probably have liked this movie even if it hadn't been filmed partly in my hometown.

I am a fan of Keanu's and read some of the good reports about this film, so tracked it down.My major niggle is the story line. Maybe if I had seen it when it first came out, it wouldn't feel so hackneyed and cliché ridden now. There were no real surprises for me. All the characters acted exactly as I expected them to. Some of the characters (like Chris' girlfriend) confused the hell out of me. I didn't 'get' her at all, nor the way the actress portrayed her.Having said that, the film has its moments. And the scene so many have mentioned where Chris breaks down in the father's arms IS heartbreaking and terribly sad. You find yourself thinking 'thats what the poor kid needed - a good cuddle'. Which I guess means I did invest emotionally in this film? This part was acted very well and perfectly timed (as it comes after a minor scare).The corny use of the song throughout the last part of the film grated a little, I must confess - but then I am not a fan of music being used this way in movies. I love a good soundtrack and live performances etc but not this kind of schmaltz.I came away from the movie satisfied in the end, if only because Keanu's breakdown scene confirmed my belief that he is an amazingly talented actor.

Halfway through, I was thinking, Gee, great acting and characters, but where is this thing going? It is then that one of these teens kills himself. I was as surprised and horrified as the characters in the movie. The rest of the movie depicts the devastating effects of this act on his friends and family. I felt the hole left in their lives as if it had been left in my own. Having said this, the characters are still not particularly extraordinary. As most of us know, suicide, as devastating as it is, is a mundane act. Nothing extraordinary about it. This is the genius of this movie.

You know, the one's where they teach you all of life's no-no's via After School specials--everything from eating disorders to drunk driving. 'Permanent Record' serves as a more coarse, more realistic story of teens dealing with their friends unexpected suicide.A very young, less spastic Keanu Reeves heads up the cast as Chris Townsend, a high school senior who is struggling (along with his friends) to deal with his best friend, David's, suicide. David Sinclair (Alan Boyce), the star kid that held everyone in high expectation, pressure that he just felt he could no longer deal with and, decided to kill himself.The suicide occurs early in the film, so for the most part, it is a matter of seeing how the friends deal with the situation and try to find a sense of closure (if at all). It serves less as an identifier of the warning signs of suicide, but instead may provide guidance for young folks who find themselves in a similar situation, when someone close (and presumably young) to them has died (regardless of how). So, in a sense, 'Permanent Record' is a brief, cinematic unilateral therapeutic session.Entirely emotionally driven, this film is somewhat of a tear jerker, and slightly slow moving, but does well overall. Good performances by main teen cast, especially (and surprisingly) by Keanu Reeves (who also gets to show off his talents as a guitarist). Worth watching if you can find it.

Keanu gives another excellent performace that shows why it is that he is in such demand for his services, coming across as a regular guy having to deal with a terrible situation.The soundtrack is also brilliant (its just a shame that its almost impossible to find) with many songs that will have you grabbing for a guitar.

Because for one to understand any good movie you must also accept and understand the moving and deep music that goes along with it. This movie dealt with a very hard-hitting subject that to this day is still very much real. It is not cliché or taboo. It is very real and I myself have known several people to commit suicide. The real point here is understanding just what the director intended you to get, and most did not get this movie, and even admitted it openly. I got every part of this movie and loved every part of it, and although it is hard to deal with, this is what makes it such a good movie. It is not made to entertain you, but to move you and to educate you. This is not made for opinion, for discussion or for interpretation. This movie was made to last a lifetime, and it has to those who can grasp it completely. It is not about the actors, whom did an excellent job, but about what it says.

After I'd noticed it was out on video a couple of years ago, I rented it and found it to be every bit as moving.   A skillfully made film illuminating what happens to a high school of young people in the aftermath of a colleague's suicide.  The event causes a string of reactions and revelations both delicately written and truthfully acted.  The cast is uniformly excellent.  The adult characters are as nuanced and deep as their younger counter-parts. Barry Corbin and Kathy Baker are magnificent in supporting roles as the dead boys parents.  Keanu Reeves, as the boys best friend, is for once, remarkably well cast.  The dude mannerisms that cause his performances in other films to be unintentionally comic are instead credible and poignant.

As in real life, it's more about the aftermath, the survivors, than the person committing the act.  There is no satisfying explanation as to why the main character chooses to go this way...his life seems to be fine, he's well-liked, has a girlfriend...there are no clues leading up to it.  And even though the death happens early in the movie, his presence is felt throughout the movie. Yet this is more about the survivors, the friends and how they deal with the impact on their lives.The only miss for me in the movie is the celebration at the end.  Not that it wouldn't happen in real life, but to celebrate someone who makes such an awful, desperate choice, who leaves such a mess for others around him to deal with, celebrates the wrong person.  The characters who live on are the ones who should be celebrated, because they have made the courageous choices of moving on, of being strong in spite of doubts.

It shook up my whole world like I was in a blender and everything changed. in 1988 this film came out. I skipped a class at Hunter College in NYC and went by myself at the 1st showing of the day to a theater near the school on 66th and 2nd ave. There were about 4 people in the whole theater, including me. This film was so incredibly powerful and poignant for me, little did I know. Permanent Record remained a part of me for years, until now even (2014). Back in 1988, I was the surviving friend. The 2 surviving sisters and their parents to the death of my friend remained my 2nd family, to this day. They are Italian, in Italy. I returned home to live my life and mature. Now today.

I am not sure if I can watch this film again, but I know I need to keep it close to me for when I might be ready. For those who hated it, please, no disrespect, but it really is a film specifically for those who have experienced immense loss. It's about loss of youth which equals loss of hope. To have never experienced such a monumental life changing event, one would not see past the holes in the story or the acting flaws because the film for them is just that, a film and deserves justified critiques. But for those who need to relate to this film on a more basic level that is merely the topic and it's basic execution, it works, deeply.

I like when actors convey genuine emotions without affectation. These ones kept it real, and most have barely been heard of since.Interestingly, adversity brings depth and character to one's high school career. Without it, it's just classes and parties. This group, in addition to being seemingly working class, experienced the loss of a friend and icon.This dramatic event forced them to ponder some deeper questions of life and death, and to look inward to the meaning of their own lives. When I was in high school, nothing happened, and I don't remember meeting one single person with depth, or even any interest in acquiring depth.All the actors were way past high school age. That's a common phenomenon, but the effect is to make us view high school students as essentially adults. In real life, they look and act younger and dumber than the actors who play them. Some of the girls were 25-27.Nevertheless, I admired the way these kids were engaged in life and school. They have friends, relationships, a school play, hard classes, extra curricular activities, and cars. There are high school kids who are fully engaged like this for sure.I also liked the idea of an accessible Principal or Dean. Those guys are educators, but most of us saw them as annoyances when we were young.The huge failing of this picture was the pathetically weak build-up to the lost friend's suicide. He felt overwhelmed by the pressure to be productive, so he jumps off a cliff? I know that he may have been drinking, but I just don't buy it. Having said that, the movie really wasn't about that. It was about his suicide's effect on those he left behind.I think that it affected the other kids so deeply, not because they knew him well and loved him..although Keanu did, but because he was a teen icon to them. He was a rock, even to those who just admired him from afar, because he represented stability, confidence, capability, success, and opportunity. One character mentions that notion. (If David couldn't make it, what chance do the rest have, who don't have even half his ability and talent?) The film shows the kids in Portland and the beach constantly, as if those two places are close to one another. They are not. So I am assuming that they lived somewhere between Portland and the beach and frequented both places. I liked the exterior shots at the beach and in the city, with a light rail system.I couldn't stand the sappy, sentimental song solo at the end. But I suppose that the character was determined to memorialize David (suicide character), by singing his composition, even though it was in the midst of an established classic play. (David had been working on this song for his band to record) I didn't really believe the blonde who had been David's sex partner. I get the idea that a busy guy like him didn't really have time for a relationship, but she looked too worldly and old. If you look her up, you will see that she was some kind of beauty queen in real life, and was pushing 27 in the film.I also did not get the Jennifer Rubin character. If she wasn't David's girlfriend, then who was she? He didn't seem the slightest bit interested in her. I guess she just admired him enormously.I did however love the way one actress portrayed Keanu Reeve's girlfriend. She was quirky and genuinely supportive and involved in people's lives. She tried to be a good girlfriend, despite her boyfriend's eccentricities, she was trying to find herself through writing, and she tried earnestly to memorialize David. Great job by this girl who played a sex role in Valley Girl 5 years earlier.Everyone has already complimented Reeves for his break-down crying scene. I will too. The guy has considerably more talent than most people give him credit for. I like his natural way, although I admit that he repeated it several times in the 80s.Good flick.

Keanu Reeves pretty much gives us the same person he was in The Rivers Edge, only a little more sensitive.  The key scene for me is when he gets drunk and crashes his car in the yard of his friend who died.  The father comes out screaming and yelling, the Keanu breaks down, blaming himself for not being able to stop the suicide from happening.As for the vagueness of the reason he the guy committed suicide; can we ever know for sure why some kids feel so hopeless they feel the only exit is death? "},{"Title":"Not as bad as some would have you believe","Date":"26 December 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Music, Romance","Review":"  I disagree with a previous comment that i read on the site, which said that this movie was bad, and the acting was terrible. I think the acting was ok (from Keanu , and whoever played his girlfriend) to quite excellent from the other cast members, especially the principal who had a fairly minor role. The movie conveys well a group of friends, and how they deal with a close friends suicide. It doesn't explain why he did it, but it was never about that. It shows the wide range of emotions involved when a friend commits suicide, from anger, sadness, and eventually acceptance at the loss. A sad movie, but a well done one. It doesn't preach to you, saying how evil David was for commiting suicide etc. It just examined the aftermath. Well worth a watch. "}{"Title":"Suicide should come earlier","Date":"13 January 2014","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Music, Romance","Review":" David is a popular student. During a late night party, David falls off a cliff. His friend Chirs (Keanu Reeves) suspects that it was suicide, but he can't figure out why. He hopes to use David's music at the school memorial, but the school cancels it after discovering the suspected suicide.It's dark meandering tale of teenage angst. It's a good one at that. The suicide comes in a little late. At around 30 minutes, the movie gets going too slowly and too late. The audience doesn't really need to see or hear from David. He is better as a memory from the other characters.Keanu Reeves gives another performance like 'River's Edge'. He's very effective as a disenfranchised teen. In fact, this is his story which adds to the argument to skip most of David's scenes in the beginning. Keanu's the star and the camera knows it.

It leaves his family and his best friend (Keanu Reeves) asking a lot of questions...and blaming themselves.Good idea, badly handled. For starters this HAS been done before 1988--mostly in TV movies and After School Specials. Aside from some swearing and dialogue (hence the PG-13 rating) this added nothing new. The outcome is predictable and Reeve's attempts at acting were truly painful to watch. He's good NOW but not in 1988. Aside from that his character was dressed like a slob and always looked so dirty is was hard to build up sympathy.That aside the movie is dull. I saw every scene coming and every surprise was telegraphed. I basically couldn't wait for this thing to get over.I have a vague recollection of seeing it in a theatre in 1988 and hating it (it bombed BADLY). It still looks lousy almost 20 years later. The subject is worth handling but it's been done better (with better acting) in countless other movies. Ordinary People comes to mind. You can skip this one.

It isn't as horrible as the other review states.  Some of the music is good, one song, though overly melodramatic Wishing on Another Lucky Star performed near the end, was good.  It's just a little cheesy.  But hey, it was the 80s, Keanu Reeves is in the movie playing a dumbass (huge surprise), what do you expect? Basically, it is a very polished (in that 80s way which is barely) after school special.  Don't expext any emotional revelations from it.  If you're looking for a touching movie about grief, see Ordinary People but if you just want to see a watchable movie with a few cute, sappy moments, this flick is for you!

Keanu has never been so bad in a role but the subject of the movie was good. Someone had commented about the movie before me and said that the point of the suicide wasn't told. HE WAS GAY! If you didn't get that you shouldn't comment. The acting was bad by all of the actors but there is one scene that's convincing; Keanu is drunk and almost hits David's younger brother and starts crying infront of David's father. His pain is kind of real there.The fact that a movie deals with the suicide of a teen-aged boy is good so I gave the movie a 7.

But after 5 minutes of watching, I noticed how horrible his acting was, he walks and talks so stupid the whole time, it's fake and not convincing. It doesn't end there, almost ALL the characters act so badly it's laughable, the only acceptable acting was by Alan Boyce (David), but the guy commits suicide early on and you don't see him again, you never even know why he did it! Everything about this movie screams low quality, I can't believe how such a thing gets released! I was tempted many times to stop watching, in fact I did, half way through it I decided to stop watching and turned the thing off, came to the IMDB to check what other's thought about it, I found zero comments (not surprised), so I decided to force myself to handle the pain and go back to finish it then come here to comment on it. The only good thing going (for me) was the high-school Rock band theme, the occasional guitar playing and singing parts, but that's not worth it.Very bad acting and directing... Terrible movie. "}]
