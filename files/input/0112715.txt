[{"Title":"Memorably quirky and juvenile; unique and underappreciated","Date":"19 April 2002","Score":"131 out of 167 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Mystery","Review":"  Congo is the first movie on the IMDB for which I am writing a user comment. I am giving it this distinction because, although it is not the best movie I have ever seen, nor my all-time favorite movie, it is one of my personal favorites nonetheless.  If I could choose only ten movies to own, or even just five, Congo would be one of them.Because so many people dislike Congo, or are at least indifferent to it, I feel compelled to explain why I like it.  I like Congo because it's different in the seven years since I first saw it in June of 1995, I've seen countless other movies, but Congo still retains its uniqueness, I believe.  Other movies have tried to duplicate Congo's juvenile sense of adventure and tongue-in-cheek humor (most notably the two Mummy movies), but none of them have surpassed Congo as one of the most gleefully preposterous and deliriously fun yarns I've ever seen.So many people have criticized Congo in so many ways that I'm not sure which complaint I should address first.  The consensus among most comments seems to be that the character of Amy, the talking gorilla, pretty much ruins the movie because she is annoying and unconvincing.  Although I cannot deny that Amy is, indeed, a woman in a gorilla costume which is not quite convincing, I should also say (1) that when I first saw Congo, I thought Amy was pretty convincing, and at least acceptable; and (2) convincing gorillas in movies are rare, in my opinion.  Rick Baker's work in Gorillas in the Mist and the Mighty Joe Young remake is the best I've seen; and although Amy (created by Stan Winston's team, not Baker's) is inferior to Baker's best work, she's better than some of Baker's apes in Burton's terrible Planet of the Apes remake.  If I must choose between Amy, and Tim Roth in an obvious chimpanzee costume, I choose Amy.Another common complaint is that the movie Congo is inferior to Michael Crichton's novel, upon which it was based.  I read the novel in early 1995, just prior to seeing the movie, and so the book was still fresh in my mind when I saw the movie and I thought the movie did an excellent job of conveying the essence of the book, and gave the story an offbeat style which sets the movie apart from the book.  The movie also has a healthy sense of humor about itself, which Crichton's novel lacks and sorely needs.I almost forgot the actors!  Some people hate Congo simply because it lacks a Mel Gibson or Bruce Willis; nevertheless it does boast a talented and interesting cast of mostly underrated actors.  Laura Linney has given good, strong performances in many movies, but I argue that her performance in Congo is still her most entertaining.  Dylan Walsh gives an earnest, appealing performance as the earnest, appealing Peter Elliot, whose devotion to Amy (however laughable it is for many viewers) gives the movie some heart.  Ernie Hudson gives a clever, unforgettable performance as Munro Kelly; although black, he possesses the mannered speech and condescending attitude of an authentic great white hunter, one of the movie's best gags. Grant Heslov has little to do, but some of his delivery is terrific (Safari?  I don't even like picnics!)  Tim Curry is a sheer delight in this movie, giving a campy performance as the monomaniacal Herkermer Homolka, a Roumanian philanthropist obviously written into the movie (the character does not exist in the novel) to correspond with Wayne Knight's character Dennis Nedry in Jurassic Park.  Some people are offended by Curry's performance, and believe it's offensive to Roumanians as well. Here's a tip anyone offended by anything in Congo takes life (not to mention this movie) way too seriously, and needs to lighten up.Many people hate Congo simply because it's cheesy.  But considering the story (assorted oddballs journey to a site in the African jungle which may be the legendary mines of King Solomon), how could the movie not be cheesy? Did people really expect a movie called Congo to be realistic, believable and compelling?  Surely such a movie would be even more cliched and misconceived than the one that was made.  John Patrick Shanley's script may be crude and smug, but at least it's fun, and certainly a model of efficiency Shanley trimmed the novel of subplots (such as a rival expedition, and attempts to decipher the gray gorillas' language) which would have made the movie longer, slower and more pretentious.  He added lots of pithy dialogue and made the whole affair an exercise in high camp. The result is a quintessential juvenile adventure that improves upon more bombastic and elaborate efforts like Armageddon.  And Frank Marshall's straightforward, low-key direction nicely contrasts with the inherent absurdity of the storyline; a more intense and heavy-handed director would not have been a good choice to helm a movie like Congo.Congo isn't nearly the terrible movie that many people believe it is.  It isn't a movie for everybody or even a movie for most people but it was created with a certain audience in mind, and many people are simply too serious and high-minded to belong to that audience.  Congo and movies like it are cartoons for adults if you don't like movies with colorful visuals, ridiculous plots and juvenile characters, you should not watch Congo.  But if you do like movies with those characteristics, then I submit that Congo is one of the best movies of that kind that I've ever seen.

It seems like a forgotten artifact, abandoned like King Solomon's mines, discovered only by only those who maintain some fundamental interest; what you find is going to depend on how open you keep your mind. Rest assured, those of you who would rather ignore it aren't going to be missing a diamond, but I'd say an arrowhead isn't out of the question.I'll dispense with the metaphors Congo is not a bad film. I watched it many times in my youth and just watched it again yesterday, and the biggest complaint I have is that the original song 'Sounds Of Africa' is awful. I won't summarize the plot or analyze the film in explicit detail, but I will say that it is briskly paced, sharply written, and features solid characterizations, or as solid as they can be in an adventure epic. As an example, Tim Curry has been dismissed too often as the comic relief when he is actually central to the plot and turns in a deliciously dense performance, above and beyond the limitations of his character. Considering the slightly campy tone, the special effects are well above what anyone could expect. Just don't come prepared to judge them based on modern standards or Jurassic Park. Personally, I find physical effects more endearing than CGI anyway.As many reviewers have said, it's a film of a bygone era, a lost world story treated as an adventure epic. Clearly it's not Indiana Jones and the tone tends to waver a bit, but it's never boring, and if it had been adapted from the book directly, it would have been. I can't imagine someone watching the airplane SAM scene without being excited by the action, or watching the group's border crossing struggles without at least sporting a grin.So, check your ego and check your critical faculties; this is no Citizen Kane and it doesn't pretend to be. Those that harshly criticize it, by my estimation, have a lot to learn about having a good time at the movies.

I've read Crichton's book and it's quite good, the movie however, misses a lot of the time.That being said, I still love watching it, I can't explain it, I guess it's so bad that it's good for a laugh whenever I see it, and watching people devoured by psychopathic gorillas never gets old.If you've got friends over, pop this one in and give it the MST3K treatment, you'll have a blast I'm sure.Like I said, no redeeming value to be had here but if you like watching bad movies just for the heck of it, this may be one to check out.P.S.

The fake looking gorillas were obviously not very well-made, whereas the 1993 film Jurassic Park had familiarized audiences with CG dinosaurs. In fact, CGI was originally planned for the grays, but the technology had not yet been developed to the point where realistic hair could be created. While smooth skinned dinosaurs were possible, hairy apes would have looked inappropriately cartooned. Therefore, animatronics, masks and puppetry had to be utilized. So that was kind of a damper on the special effects as well as Tim Curry's bad acting. The movie could have been a lot better, but it was viewable. If you got over the gorilla puppets and Tim Curry's accent, you have a pretty decent movie. I thought the story was good. It's not Jurassic Park, but it's Michael Crichton. Congo wasn't very realistic, but neither was Jurassic Park. It was like that show Legends of the Hidden Temple with intelligent gorillas and science. There was action and a plot. So I could sit and watch it. I'll give it (barely) 6 stars.

Because they share the author of the books they are based on, it is perhaps inevitable that in any review of Congo the film Jurassic Park will come up sooner or later. Yes, Jurassic Park vastly surpasses Congo in quality, but seeing as how the former is debatedly THE best example of a summer action flick, making that statement doesn't necessarily mean that Congo isn't worth watching.In fact, Congo is a breathtaking thriller, probably only marred by its budget which causes some of the effects to look rather cheap, and descend into the B-movie territory. That being said, director Frank Marshall still manages to not only create a film that not only succeeds as an action film, but at times the tension grows so high that it almost could be labeled as a horror flick (though I highly doubt that that was the intent).Yet there is some justification in labeling Congo as a horror film (at least in part). There are definitely some moments, particularly in the latter half of the movie, that are actually quite frightening. While the killer gorillas don't necessarily look scary up close, the savagery in which they attack and brutally murder people is pretty scary. In addition, the gore level is pretty high, especially for a PG-13 rating. The efforts on the part of the filmmakers to avoid an R rating is at times obvious, such as in some of the more brutal gorilla attacks, the picture is fuzzy and in slow-motion (these changes are not successful, and hurt the movie). Even as it is, the levels of terror and gore are high enough to make one wonder whether the PG-13 rating is appropriate.Congo is not without its flaws. As I said before, the budget constraints make some of the effects look cheap, and at times lower the film to the B-level range. Also, the film takes a little too long to begin gaining momentum, which at times cause the film to drag (though the payoff in the latter half of the movie is well worth the wait). Finally, it is quite clear that Amy is a person in a gorilla suit (which given the complexity of the character was unavoidable). The killer gorillas don't suffer from the same fate, but they don't look particularly frightening (actually, they look rather sickly, however their actions quickly quash that notion).Frequently, acting is not a strong point for most action-adventure films, unless the characters are rather unique (as in Pirates of the Caribbean). However, Congo is an exception. It features not one, but two standout performances. Tim Curry is great as Herkermer Homolka, the jewel-obsessed Romanian philanthropist (you can almost see his eyes take the form of diamonds. It's a typical Tim Curry role, but he avoids overdoing it and becoming annoying (which I guess he is, but in a good way).But perhaps the biggest surprise is Ernie Hudson as the sarcastic, and ever so slick Monroe Kelly. It's all in the delivery, and Hudson delivers his lines with enough wit and bite to make him easily the most appealing actor in the movie. Had this movie been more popular, it would be reasonable to suspect that Hudson could have been up for an Oscar, as most of the nominees of the said award win for inferior performances. Laura Linney and Dylan Walsh are adequate, but given the staple hero characters they are given, it is probably unfair to expect more than what they give. Grant Heslov plays the neurotic sidekick that he usually plays (see True Lies), and it is pretty welcoming.I don't understand why this flopped at the box-office. Perhaps because it had to live up to the reputation of Jurassic Park, which is more than can be expected of any film.

I was disappointed, but I still have a soft spot for this story. They expected Congo to be the next King Kong and there were a good deal of toys, action figures, books, stickers, etc. to sell to the expected hordes of fans. The fans did not materialize and the action figures are an easy buy on the internet.The legend of the city of Zinj is a phenomenal idea to work with for a film. Evolved apes is a sure seller. But this movie did not deliver. There were so many missed opportunities and examples of poor writing. For me the ape researcher on the expedition is a bit goofy to be credible. And he is one of the central characters! We are not given much to believe his knowledge or utility to the expedition or to Amy for that matter. This spoils that character. I liked the African actors in the film and was willing to go along with the hunter and his somewhat distracting phony English accent. But somehow, the film did not deliver what it could easily have delivered action plus thought-provoking story about animal intelligence.

The film is no masterpiece,it is a bit cheesy, but it does have a sense of fun, (ie. Bruce Campbell, Stop eating my sesame cake) and not as bad as the rating suggests. The special effects are nothing special, and I didn't get why the gorillas jumped into the lava at the end. That was the most cheesy thing about Congo. The script had its ups and downs, and the direction was a bit inexperienced. But the acting was on the whole alright. Laura Linney, who is a very good actress is a strong lead. Dylan Walsh pales in comparison but has some good delivery. Ernie Hudson is the best actor in the movie, with his easy-going charm and his grin. As for Tim Curry, at first I was put off by the accent, but hey it's acting. He was like a parallel to Dennis in Jurassic Park which is better. But I liked him here,he gave a great delivery of such classic lines. Please stop criticising him, when he was actually one of the reasons why I like the movie. He didn't deserve that Razzie nomination; that should have been Grant Heslov, whose delivery was whiny and his character was poorly written. Amy starts off well, like the movie, but grates on the nerves when the movie wears on. I am terrified of the King Solomons Mine scene, it is just very graphic, having your head bashed in like that. I know it's pretend but it felt real.The scenery was splendid, the cinematography was excellent and Jerry Goldsmith's music was good. In conclusion, a fairly watchable movie, if you don't mind too much cheese, and shouldn't be compared to Jurassic Park, the only thing they have in common were that they were written by the same author. 6/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"This film is special to me.","Date":"18 May 2006","Score":"29 out of 48 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Mystery","Review":" I remember being only six years old when my older brother and his friends rented this one night. I watched it with them and now that I am seventeen years old, I feel that this was one of my most cherished memories. Of course i fell asleep near the end of it then, but it was still a really good memory, to watch CONGO with them. And now I have viewed this film fairly recently without falling asleep and have read the Michael Crichton(Jurassic Park, The Andromeda Strain) book. I for one find this film to be very entertaining. Of course it goes without saying that this film is not completely accurate to the book. They have added new characters and added more gory death and less technology and actual factual feeling. The creators could have made this film an interesting sci-fi adventure feature, but instead they have made a B movie. Although the film feels like the former, and did when i was six. This film has enough technology and factual feel to be interesting, but not quite believable. And yet, this for once, is not at all a bad thing. The film is pretty convoluted. It is about a primatologist and a friend who have a talking gorilla(via electronic headset) and decide to go to it's birthplace to see what its like and discover what happened to a team that went their a little while earlier to find a treasure in which Tim Curry randomly appears in a fake accent and pretends to be a companion who is searched for by a stereotypical soldier looking dude who turns out not to be a friend and, yeah. I don't really know how to exactly explain the plot, suffice to say that somehow, the gorilla named Amy and her friends, for some reason, must escape from a helicopter because they are shot at and end up in the jungle, not alone, with all of their crew mates and stuff. And from there on, they must try to avoid danger from snakes, hippos, and a wild pack of mutated monkeys that intend to eat their flesh and kill everyone. I know that this film sounds completely ridiculous and stupidly pointless, but that is really part of the fun. Usually movies are either thought provoking and interesting, or entertaining. This film is very entertaining and funny. This film also has a high body count, with a lot of characters meeting their end in gruesome ways. It takes itself seriously, but not seriously enough to make it not fun. I liked this film as a kid because it was funny and fun. It still works for me.

Well, it's silly and underdeveloped with some pretty shabby special effects but god help me, I like it.The plot is somewhat episodic as multiple different characters with wildly different motives converge on the Congo. One is a communications technician (played nicely by Lauara Linney) who is looking for her fiancé. Another is a Romanain nut case (played by the fabulous Tim Curry) who is looking for a mythical, lost diamond mine. And the last is a gorilla expert returning a talking gorilla back to her natural habitat. I swear, I'm NOT making this up.The cast as a whole is OK. Linney is appealing, Curry turns in a usual fine job, and cameos from Bruce Campbell and Joe Don Baker add to the quirky atmosphere. Special mention should go to Ernie Hudson, who's roguish charm while not as polished as Harrison Ford's, makes a great Clark Gable/Indiana Jones type-explorer.The special effects are kind of a mixed bag. The gorillas are obviously stunt-men but the hokeyness is kind of fun. The climax in the temple is also silly but still rousing. Topping all this off, the quirky Jerry Goldsmith score adds considerably to the film as a whole.Although certainly not a classic or even 100% good, Congo is a cheesy, yet entertaining jungle adventure movie and is worth seeing.

It stands alone, though it really should have been a based on and not an adaptational work.Amy is a seven-year-old gorilla from the Verunga Region of the Congo, taken captive and sold to a university for study. Dr. Peter Elliot (portrayed so very well by Dylan Walsh) is the primatologist who has full charge of Amy and her development. In a lonely impulse of delight, he has taught his ward to speak through the use of sign language and technology, but Amy is having problems.She is experiencing nightmares, based on her past as a very young gorilla, and a deep longing to return to the jungle.In his love of Amy, Dr. Elliot endeavors to return her to the place of her birth, with the assistance of philanthropist Herkimer Homolka (one of Tim Curry's best roles in my opinion, as a serious actor and not a character actor, he is quite believable) and the well-equipped Dr. Karen Ross (wonderfully portrayed by Laura Linney), an ex CIA agent who is now an executive with Travel-Com; a corporation in desperate need of a flawless diamond from the Congo to power its next Cash-Cow.(SUB-PLOT) Travel-Com's megalomaniacal CEO/CFO has sent his son and another team to the Congo to search for the diamond so desperately needed by the corporation.

I left the theater a little nerve-racked due to the fairly graphic ending when the hybrid gorillas were finally unleashed in broad daylight, face to face, to go on their killing rampage. I have since watched this movie again at the age of 30, minutes prior to writing this review after reading what other people thought about it. I'm on the Pro side.Now my biggest couple of compliments of this movie is the time length. This movie is nearly 2 hours long(158 with credits). This gives the movie so many extra scenes of character development and the time to do small things that build the characters up to give them depth and for you to understand them all, care for some, and not care so much about others. This is one thing this movie does that a lot of others don't.Another thing is the hybrid gorillas. There are 2 scenes with them near the end, but they're both fairly brief, trickery camera work was done on one scene with the gorilla in the temple so you couldn't make it out 100% completely(yet you obviously knew what it was) and the other was the scene with the tripod guns at night. Night. In darkness. Again, you don't get a full good view of them. They wait to unleash their furious killing rampage until the very very final end to the movie for it's climax battle-scene. Most other creature feature films give the monster away in full-blown face-to-face view much earlier than this. Again, this is helped by the movies length.The people involved with why this movie came to be Micheal Chriton, Kathleen Kenedy, etc. All these people had a big hand in Jurassic Park. So you know that even though the movie is B grade, it's going to get a huge kick in the ass to be a DAMN good B movie.Due to the movie's length, this movie really is a very long expedition through the jungle of the Congo, and even prior to that there's a half a dozen scenes showing you their struggles and negotiations to get across borders. There are all types of transportation on their expedition with their own troubles in each one. There's an airplane, river rafting over rapids, calm deep water, on foot, and an escape with a hot air balloon at the end. This movie gives them the time to setup base camp like 3 or 4 different times. They meet an African tribe who found one of the scientists fellow employees. So whether or not you enjoyed the characters portrayed in this movie, they did all the right things to help give them depth and develop them fully.Most favorite comic relief STOP EATING MY SESAME CAKE. That one line could be tacked onto any kid's video at the end with his logo for comic relief. Plus it was just hilarious.The stars. Ernie Hudson. Dead on. Perfectly played as the intelligent safari leader. Tim Curry. Perfectly played, despite the sometimes cramped accent, as the greedy diamond hunter looking for the lost city of Zing, containing King Solomon's mines. The communication's scientist looking for her ex and a flawless diamond. Played well and another intelligent character who might not know as much about the Congo's dangers, but catches on quickly. The gorilla expert with Amy. Great chemistry there, albeit a bit PG at times. His colleague is played well as a gutless chicken with no balls at all. Garhaygar(spelling?), very well played as Monroe's obvious long-time buddy who knows the jungle pretty well as well.The climax with the killer gorillas. Still like it to this day and sometimes often just watch that scene only when I don't want to watch the whole movie(even though I'm tempted to watch it again just cause it's such a long adventure movie). I do the same thing with Ghost. I like that movie but sometimes just watch Carl and Willy get taken to Hell(haha).All in all, due to being dated and having some B qualities, this is a movie that got a serious A-quality kick in the pants and is highly enjoyable. You just have to sit down and be prepared to invest yourself in a movie that pushes being 2 hours long.A very solid and proud 8 out of 10.

CONGO goes back to the old tradition of adventure movies, refurbishing it with new technology, gadgets and pumping it up with special effects (created by the ILM crew that brought us JURASSIC PARK). At the same time, CONGO brings along the genre's cheesiness, and it quite shows. The gorillas are pretty unconvincing at some parts, which you know are simply guys in gorilla suits acting it out (since, at the time CG has not yet perfected the creation of fur). The screenplay is often filled with mediocre dialog.The film is based on Michael Chricton's other bestselling novel and, although I haven't read the book, I'm pretty sure Chricton can't devise such a lousy story. Still, what the heck, I liked this movie. It's fun and very funny. The film takes itself a bit seriously in places it shouldn't, but I liked its nods at old adventure movies. Bring in Johnny Weissmüller and the Tarzan yell! The movie has a gorilla expert (Dylan Walsh) joining an expedition to the dark region of the Congo to return his beloved pet/test subject, a gorilla named Amy. The expedition is also accompanied by Dr. Karen Ross (Laura Linney), who works for a company called Travicom, ordered by her boss (Joe Don Baker) to investigate what has become of the first expedition sent there (as well as another objective). Also along for the trip is a Romanian philantrophist Herkermer Homolka (Tim Curry, in a Romanian accent). Their Great White Hunter, who happens to be black, is the daring Monroe Kelly (Ernie Hudson from GHOSTBUSTERS).CONGO is filled with cheesiness. Clichés are there, as are some bits of silliness that is very convincing that this isn't a Chricton creation (as a film that is). But that's just part of the fun. CONGO is a lot of fun if you are willing to suspend your disbelief for two hours (at least). The special effects are pretty good, but the film is still high on adventure. Directed by Frank Marshall, the energy is quite high, and the action scenes are pretty good.CONGO is quite silly, but that's its heart on the right place. Rating ***1/2 out of 5.

So, when I heard that Frank Marshall, the producer who worked with Steven Spielberg in the Indiana Jones films, directed this adaptation of the book, I thought it was a very cool idea and would catch my very interest, but going through with all the hatred it had, this film didn't hold up for me, but despite going over the Nostalgia Critic review of this film, however, I thought that this is an OK film. Not good, not bad. Just sort of There. A test of formal mediocrity. I'm surprised that Roger Ebert himself liked this film, but as for me, I'm calling this a guilty pleasure.There are a few good things that prevented me for giving this movie a much lower rating. The cinematography is surprisingly superb, the scenery is very nice to look at, and Jerry Goldsmith's music score was very riveting. The strongest aspect goes to the cast. Laura Linney did a good job as the strong lead. Dylan Walsh, although not his best performance, gives a good delivery. Tim Curry, however, was OK. His accent didn't interest me, but hey it's acting. What do you expect? In fact, I really liked him here despite the hammy material he's been given. So, please, critics. Stop criticizing the actor. I felt that Joe Don Baker was so annoying because he does nothing other than overreacting and shouting. The best actors in this movie so far goes to Bruce Campbell for his clever personality and Ernie Hudson for his flawless charm and grin. That's it for my praise.So, what do I hate about this movie? Well, there are four problems that didn't leave an impact. First, the Dialogue is easily mediocre. It had some crude material, but at least it had some funny moments (Stop eating my sesame cake). Second, the plot deviates itself from the book although it had a great atmosphere in some of the scenes. Third, the directing from Frank Marshall was very inconsistent. And fourth, but not the least, is the movie's cheesy special effects and I didn't get why the monkeys jump into the lava near the end of the film which was the most cheesiest moment. Even the scene in the King Solomons Mine scene was very graphic. I mean, getting your head bashed felt pretty real. Shocking, isn't it?Overall, Congo isn't as horrible as the critics generally said it was, but with a better plot and better special effects, it would have been an astounding film other than a mediocre adaptation of the book written by the same guy who wrote Jurassic Park.Rating 5.5/10 "},{"Title":"Another, albeit not bad, movie about King Solomon's Mines","Date":"18 November 2011","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Mystery","Review":" Congo is a modern day Indiana Jones, or more specifically, a modern day King Solomon's Mines. It's a great movie with everything you would expect to be in an adventure movie monsters, lost cities, a war in the background, and a group of daring adventurers. What sets this movie apart are the personalities of the adventurers. The party is made up of four groups. There is the communications corporation which is sending a team deep into the Congo to find out what happened to a previous team. The corporation wants some flawless diamonds for its laser and will do anything to get it. There are the scientists that are going into the Congo to return an ape to her natural environment, there is the archaeologist that is searching for the lost city, and then there are the mercenaries.The groups are interesting for the scientists are very open with what they want. Their ape, Amy, wants to return to the jungle so they are taking her. The mercenaries are being paid so they are happy. The secrets come in with the communications corporation and the archaeologist. They both refuse to reveal the true reason for their journey, and the truth has to be drawn out from them, which the mercenary leader manages to do.The original story is by Michael Crichton, so one can expect a little social comment in it. Once again the comment is about man playing God. The ancient city genetically created a breed of killer apes to guard the diamond mines. The apes were so vicious and uncontrollable they turn on their masters and killed them. Now nobody can go to the city because the apes will kill them. The subtle point is that the scientists are teaching the ape, Amy, to talk. What we see in the movie is the beginning of the experiment, and the end result. The ancients did what the scientists are trying to do and ended up creating a monster that they could not destroy.Congo seems to also reveal the true power of nature. Though there are lots of threats from humanity, such as the war in Zaire and the apes, they are also threatened by nature. The volcano that the city is built on is rumbling and ready to explode. This is the more obvious note. We also are confronted with other creatures, such as the Hippo and the Silverback Gorilla. The hippopotamus (greek for River Horse) may seem like a placid creature, but in the wild they are brutes. When I first saw the movie I thought that they were crocodiles until I realised that they were really hippos. Then there is the Silverback. When they are confronted with it, one suddenly realises that that creature could rip a full-grown man apart. Not something to trifle with.Congo is a great little adventure movie with everything one would expect in such a movie. The action keeps on coming and the characters are all interesting. The best thing is, they didn't kill of my favourite character in the end. But then again, you would expect him to know a little bit about staying alive.

In the end Congo, is reasonably entertaining but as a result of too many clichés, sub-par acting, mediocre special effects, and an overly short running time, it is also pretty cheap. On some level it may work as a satire, of Spielberg. There are times when the movie feels and looks so fake that you find yourself laughing. Perhaps this is intentional. Congo is B-movie material, but it has some weird and amusing charms to offer. It has lasers, talking gorillas, funny looking temples, hungry hungry Hippos, even hungrier killer apes and more.

The unproven Frank Marshall (director of Arachnaphobia and long time executive producer for Steven Spielberg) helms on this occasion, but unfortunately only presents a less than enthralling show.Congo's main downfall is its adapted screenplay from John Patrick Shanley (Moonstruck) which is appallingly two dimensional, unable as it is to hide the obvious conclusion, it also fails to properly develop many pivotal relationships (such as the rapport between 'talking ape' Amy and primatologist Peter Elliot - Dylan Walsh - and the growing respect between Peter and Travicom agent Karen Ross) and most of the characters lack depth. A real shame considering we're probably missing much of the real intrigue that Crichton's novel would have possessed.The story is a potentially fascinating one about three searches, one for the ancient, mythological Zing (King Solomon's fabled city which was believed to house a diamond mine of incredible bounty), another for the legendary killer ape, and finally for a diamond of such purity and clarity that it could herald an enormous laser communications break through. Sadly neither Shanley nor Marshall are able to reflect any of this in their movie.Dylan Walsh and Laura Linney (agent Ross) are solid while Tim Curry is enjoyable as obsessive Hungarian Fortune explorer Herkermer Homolka. Yet by far the most rewarding turn comes from Ernie Hudson, as great white hunter Monroe Kelly, whose tongue in cheek acting is a delight.Another surprising disappointment is the special f/x and art direction, both being only reasonable.

The cast of characters was quite colorful and well developed. Ernie Hudson's character, as leader of the expedition (or when Laura Linney allowed him--more on this latter on), was a refreshing change from the usual Great White Hunter we've become accustomed to; Dylan Walsh's character feels compelled to return is pet gorilla to her home in the jungle when she begins having nightmares, coupled with transforming the dorm into a rain forest art gallery; Delroy Lindo and Joe Pantoliano both make cameo appearances as well; however, Tim Curry and Grant Heslov return mediocre performances as the typical greedy treasure hunter and the typical Ugly American.By far, the two most annoying characters are the aforementioned Dr. Karen Ross (Laura Linney) and the stupid gorilla.

The one-sheets show a gorilla in close-up with lines of computer data over it, suggesting a dark, cryptic, eerie jungle thriller. And what does the audience get? 'Indiana Jones and the Lost City of Zinj.' There are reports that Crichton was not at all happy with what was done to his novel, which I can easily believe. The book's basic plot serves as a launching point for this adventure/comedy and that's pretty much where the similarity ends. The horrific shocks in the novel, of which there are plenty, are reduced to gross-out gags in the movie. There is hardly any sustained sense of terror; the filmmakers seem much more concerned about what the next witty one-liner will be. Ernie Hudson is best as Captain Munro Kelly, the supercool mercenary and guide who is never at a loss in dealing with any situation. Though his character is the cliché' to end all clichés', Hudson plays Kelly very entertainingly and he's a lot of fun to watch. Laura Linney as Dr. Karen Ross is attractive and enjoyable too, though she has zero believability as a bad-ass ex-CIA agent. She's just too petite, cute, and blonde... it would be like trying to pass off Sally Fields' 'Gidget' as a hit-man for the mob. Along for the ride as a corrupt treasure-seeker is Tim Curry, whose character wears out his welcome after about five minutes, on-screen and with the film audience as well. The only other character worth noting is Amy, the talking gorilla, who was central to the novel's plot. However, for the movie, nearly all the seriousness has been taken out of her presence and she looks and sounds nothing so much as the prototype for an 'Amy' doll to be sold as part of the movie's marketing. 'Congo' clearly doesn't take itself very seriously and that attitude is frequently at odds with the source material, with its brutal killings and ominous hints of a race of killer apes. The trek through the African jungle and mountains might have come from any recent adventure flick. There is a funny moment when Dr. Ross, who is rolling in money, unveils her state-of-the-art sleeping tents and other high-dollar supplies. We even have air conditioners, she says before admitting, I suppose that is a bit much. Captain Kelly disagrees, saying, Shit, I'll take one. Some of the sets inside the lost city during the climax have a cheesy retro look to them, resembling a live action Saturday morning kids' TV show. The best way to watch 'Congo' is to forget you ever read the book and just take it on its own terms... seen that way, it's a fairly enjoyable little jungle flick.

Every 15-second scene tells you something that the average movie would spend 5 minutes on. All crap, slack, and non-essential stuff is cut out.

Two of them wants to take a talking(!) gorilla back to the jungle where she was once born. A scientist is looking for a diamond that her company badly needs, and she´s also looking for her lost co-worker and ex-boyfriend, who disappeared in the jungles of Congo. With them are also a greedy Romanian (with a very peculiar accent) who wants diamonds for his own. To protect them from various dangers, they´ve hired a sleezy mercenary, who´s got a group of soldiers (who later are revealed to be pretty useless when it comes to fighting). In the jungle they encounter lots of dangers such as bad weather, a spooky indian tribe and a crazy hippo, before they finally face their worst opponent yet murder gorillas!Congo has everything a classic B-movie should have; a silly plot, B-actors, unconvincing special effects, lots of logical gaps in the script and talking gorillas. The movie feels a bit like a roller-coaster at Universal Studios or something, however it´s not a very funny one.It begins with an exciting scene in the jungle, but we only get a glimpse of what will come. But after this Congo soon becomes boring and stupid, with weapons made of diamonds and an irritating gorilla. And in the end everything just collapses and becomes a shoot-em-up flick. The movie has some beautiful sceneries of the African nature, but this doesn´t help the movie much.The actors are okay, but Laura Linney and David Hasselhoff-look alike Dylan Walsh are far to pale in the leading roles. Instead, Congo belongs to the mercenary, played by Ernie Hudson, and the Romanian scoundrel, played by the delightful Tim Curry. These two have some funny moments, and almost makes this a comedy. Since you´ll be laughing out loud when you hear the stupid lines and see the crappy effects, you might actually believe that Congo is intended to be a comedy. I was also very surprised to see unbilled performances by the two great actors Joe Pantoliano and Delroy Lindo. I mean, what are THEY doing in this mess? Bruce Evil Dead Campbell has a very small role, but it´s funny to see him in a movie, since we get to see far to little of this great actor, I think.It seems to me that those who has read the book Congo by Michael Crichton were very disappointed with the movie, and really hated it because the book was so much better. I haven´t read the book, so I can´t comment that, but I think that the movie is pretty harmless and if you don´t think too much about it, it´s not THAT bad.** out of *****  "},{"Title":"Atrocious!!!","Date":"1 July 1999","Score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Mystery","Review":"  This is one of the worst blasphemies of Michael Crichton's work to date.

It was cause by how mediocre, this horror movie was. Loosely based on Michael Crichton's novel of the same name, Congo is a movie that really slip on its banana peel concept and fell hard on its ass. Directed by Frank Marshall, the movie tells the story of a group of explorers, trying to find the Ancient Lost City of Zinj, in hopes, of finding a very rare diamond that can be used as a weapon. Without spoiling the movie too much, I found the complex story to be a little bloated. Not only was the expedition for the rare diamonds, but also a quest to recover, what went wrong with the first, doomed expedition. While also, trying to return a domestic annoying primate, back to her troop in the jungle surround the city. Come on, that's a little too much for what's supposed to be simple B-movie plot. I just, glad, they didn't add, the American expedition competing with a German-Japanese consortium to reach Zinj that came from the novel, because the film run time, would be way, too long. I know that Crichton wanted to do a modern day retelling version of King Solomon's Mines, but you can't ignore this 800 Pound Gorilla in the Room, even if you want to. I'm better off, just stating it out, right now. I have to say, most of the films problems, came from its source material. This blood diamond metaphor novel was pretty bad! Not only that, but, most of it was plagiarize. It's a bit odd, that Congo has a strong similarity with the 1935's short story Jewels of Gwahlur, by author Robert E. Howard. Among the similar plot elements are a quest to find a hidden treasure consisting of valuable gems, concealed in an ancient lost city, deep in the African jungle, guarded by highly intelligent grey-ape-like creatures with super-human strength. Second off, I felt like Crichton, barely did any work, making this book, somewhat intelligent. It really lacks any realistic science, compare to his other works. Come on, Crichton, knew, better than to say, that small explosive devices can set off a volcano eruption. Even the film had some really dated data being spill here. First is the statement that a 'worldwide network enabling billions of computers to communicate with each other' is theoretically impossible. Wow, just wow! Just think about that for a second. The film came out in 1995, during the rise of the internet! Other out-of-date information that the movie was forcing on people, was that gorilla are not dangerous and cutting down the forest doesn't affect global warming. Because of these misleading information, the movie really had to work hard, to make sure, that author Robert E. Howard's estate wouldn't sue, and also make the outrageous plot of unknown mutant gorilla that for generations defended a lucrative diamond mine in the heart of the Congo jungle seem logically and different from Howard's work. Sadly, they didn't pull this off. Significant cause of disappointment among the novel's fans was that, of the gorillas. They were obviously costumed humans and puppets with noticeable fur mask gaps on the necks, whereas the 1993 film Jurassic Park had familiarized audiences with CGI dinosaurs. CGI was originally planned for the gray gorillas, but the technology hadn't yet been developed to the point where accurate hair could be created. While smooth-skinned dinosaurs were possible, bushy apes would have looked unfortunately silly. Animatronics, masks, and puppetry had therefore to be used, created by Stan Winston in a last ditch attempt to save the film. It really didn't work. Another problem with the film is the characters. In the book, most of the characters were mostly heartless jerks with little to no character development. Because of this, the film had to rewrite, most of the characters, just to get people to watch them. I like how the main character, Karen Ross (Laura Linney) obtains a more humane objective, rather than keeping most of her heartless attitude that came from the book. The film also removes some of her more immoral actions, like trying to blackmail people to go along with her, or her ambition to blow things up, like the volcano. Surprising, Laura Linney isn't a bad actress in this film. She was pretty alright in the role. Her co-star, Dylan Walsh, not so much. He was pretty forgettable, as Dr. Peter Elliot. His pet gorilla, Amy (Voiced by Shayna Fox) was somewhat annoying with her repetitive sayings. Tim Curry as their benefactor, the Romanian philanthropist Herkermer Homolka was so over the top in his role. The Russian accent, he was trying to pull, was hilarious. Their other backer, R.B Travis (Joe Don Baker) was such a one-dimensional angry-boss. Joe Don Baker plays him, way over the top. All, he does is yell and scream! He's very annoying. Bruce Campbell as Travis's son, Charlie Travis was mediocre at best with his hokey acting. His role in the film was way too short. Ernie Hudson as Captain Munro Kelly, their guard was wonderful. He really pull off, the charm, very well. In the novel, Munro Kelly is a mixed-race Scotsman named Charles Munro, described as the son of a Scottish noble adventurer and his handsome Indian housemaid. In the film, he is a British man of African descent. By far, Hudson was best actor in this film. While, most of the acting wasn't good, at least, the film locations were somewhat exotic. The use of ILM's matte paintings, miniatures and animation are good. I like how they use real diamonds. The movie also really good action scenes! While, it makes no sense, why a volcano would suddenly erupts, collapsing the mine into molten lava. The ending was pretty intense. Overall The film is not that good, but it's watchable. It could had been better.

Dylan Walsh is a likable addition to the cast as the primologist. To the story's credit Linney never has a hot spring scene and there is no real love story in the mix. Not that I would have minded either; it's just refreshing that the film avoids such clichés, maybe because the rest of the story is full of well-worn material. For instance, Tim Curry as the diamond-obsessed creep and the volcano-erupting, temple-colapsing climax.The best castmember is Ernie Hudson as Monro Kelly, who takes the reigns of the expedition and refers to himself as a great white hunter who happens to be black (hee, hee). I don't remember seeing Hudson in any other film or TV show but he's stellar here. He effortlessly commands the safari and responds to the string of dangerous encounters with a confident, bemused detachment.The stellar filming locations include Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Costa Rico and the Los Angeles County Botanic Garden.With the exception of Raiders of the Lost Ark, which is in a league of its own, Congo is on par or better than the other Indiana Jones flicks.

Also, Congo's a gentle, unmalicious viewing which so helps in strengthening its gorier moments, and it's backed by a drastically popular novel, oh, and it has lava!

The special effects are OK too; what this movie lacks is any kind of imagination or shred of originality to lift it up from it's generic trappings that most mediocre movies fall victim to. A movie about killer apes, it's gotta be at least kind of cool, right? There is maybe about fifteen minutes of screen time that even involves said killer apes, let alone shows them, and it is (of course) wedged somewhere in to the latter portion of the third act. There is a friendly gorilla who is a consistent character throughout the movie. Amy, the talking gorilla, is about the only thing (besides Tim Curry) that won me over, but after about the first hour, it actually begins to feel like a movie about people with a gorilla character, not a movie about gorillas. You know the kind of bad movie in which after a long while, you notice it's just been different scenes of the characters talking to each other the whole time, well after it should have started to deliver? Yeah, if you've seen a lot of movies, you know what I mean. Congo could have easily had about twenty minutes shaved off, being stuffed full of useless and distracting development. My review (if accepted, after I write this) will likely be wedged somewhere in the back, never to be read by anyone else who grew up with the name Congo in the back of their mind and are curious about that 90s blockbuster about killer apes, and will be put behind the apparently favored it's fun to watch reviews, but let at least one person tell you; it's silly, it's convoluted and pointless, it's disappointing.

The expedition's goal is to search for a deposit of extremely valuable, rare diamonds that, in the hands of TraviCom, will change the telecommunications industry overnight. However, SOMETHING slaughters the entire expedition party, and that includes the son of the company CEO that TraviCom employee Karen Ross loves. At the insistence of her boss, Karen Ross links up with Peter Elliot, a California primatetologist and his female gorilla, Amy (whom Peter has taught to paint and speak sign language with the help of an electronic glove).Once the new expedition reaches Africa, they bring on board Monroe Kelly, a great white hunter who happens to be black and a Romanian philanthropist named Herkemer Homolka. The expedition faces its fare share of obstacles before finally reaching its destination; the fabled lost city of Zinj, home to the same rare diamonds that the first TraviCom expedition was looking for. Unfortunately for the protagonists, the city of Zinj is home to something deadly genetically mutated carnivorous gray gorillas, created and trained by the ancient people of Zinj to guard the valuable diamonds. Once the gray gorillas make themselves known, the explorers learn that in the African Congo, YOU ARE THE ENDANGERED SPECIES! If you love Michael Crichton or any movie that takes place in the jungle, this is the movie for you! The story is a well-translated yet slightly different telling of Crichton's story. The characters are well-defined and the acting is on a scale of 1 to 10, a 7. The late special-effects wizard Stan Winston uses amazing, realistic costumes with animatronic masks to breathe life into the signing gorilla Amy and the terrifying gray gorillas. Amy herself is a great character brought to life by both Stan Winston's robotic ape mask and the suit performer who brought out Amy's signing skills out really well. All in all, I love this movie, and everyone who gave it a negative review needs to find a better line of work! Most of Congo is flawless with two exceptions. One for a suspense movie, there were only a few scenes of pure suspense and mostly action. There needed to be more scenes of suspense (such as the gray gorillas picking off people without anyone else knowing or more scenes of pure quiet that could've suddenly exploded with a scare). Also, the origin story of the gray gorillas was merely brushed over and not explained in full. There needed to be a fully-detailed explanation of the gray's origins, such as clues throughout the city that would lead up to the discovery of their origins or an autopsy scene to determine what kind of ape they really were.Besides those two flaws, the rest of Congo is pure Crichton, pure adventure, and pure fun. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves Crichton and good-old-fashioned jungle adventure stories.

Rent it and see for yourself.The main joy for me when I saw the film during its original release in theaters was to watch Laura Linney in her first starring role. I knew then that great things were in store for her. Not to mention her having the best dimples on the planet! I am in awe of her body of work on stage, in films, and on TV; and since she just turned 41, I look forward to her continuing to grow in her craft. My most recent experience in that regard was watching her guest-starring appearances on the last 5 episodes of Frasier, in which she stole the show from its regular cast, and gave the series a wonderfully edgy and entertaining finish. Although she is better known for her stage and film roles, her being able to go back and forth among the various actors' venues is refreshing, not to mention her ability to devour both dramatic and comedic roles with equal proficiency.

One of the problems in adapting any work of Crichton is the technical background behind any of his novels. The Andromeda Strain was successfully adapted but that took a lot of expense and extraordinary effort. Most producers do not have the desire or resources to do the same. Also, there was a considerable amount of time between the publication of the novel and the making of this particularly movie (about 15 years). Part of the premise of his novel, the communicating gorilla, was simply found to not be true. In the early 1980s it was determined that very little communication was coming from the sign language enabled apes. Most of that research was shut down; continuing only with the most intelligent apes that showed the most potential. Even then results since that time have been lukewarm, at best. Certainly the real life apes can not communicate on the order of the fictional ape shown. The movie does not take this into account for the reason that there really could not be a movie without a communicating ape.

While he and his employees watch, we watch and are drawn into the story by proxy. But look what Crichton has done. That rich guy can't watch because he needs the diamond. Instead, we watch through the eyes of an ape who is taught to speak.

But, I do like this movie quite a lot and feel more people should give it a chance.I think Congo failed because of marketing, first and foremost. This got the summer blockbuster treatment, and unfortunately, generated an audience that didn't suit the film.On the one level this film completely works as a children's adventure movie, and on the other appeals to film-buff looking for some good fun.Let's get this out of the way. The acting is terrible. I mean really, really poor. There's a sign language-using monkey-suited midget with accompanying computerized voice synthesizer. And to top it all off there is Tim Curry.When I think of Congo I think of one character, Herkermer Homolka, played by Tim Curry. Even with thousands of movies under my belt, I still can't be sure if Curry turned-in one of the very worst performances of all-time, or whether he was just hamming it up. Regardless of why, Herkermer Homolka is one of the most enjoyable Hollywood characters ever created. Is it the terrible accent? Is it the ridiculously, one dimensional stereotype of the shyster? I can't say. But I can tell you that the character has left me in tears laughing on more than one occasion.I don't really remember a ton of the plot. They're trying to take the talking Gorilla back to Africa or something, and there's a diamond Volcano involved. You also have a ultra powerful mega-corporation paying for the adventure.I should also note that this movie has a very entertaining performance turned in by Ernie Hudson as the pragmatic liaison between the civilized west and savage Africans (passing bribes and such).Finally, one thing to watch out for, are the completely racist stereotypes of the Africans. They are portrayed as either corrupt, cowardly, superstitious, or all three. Watching this movie is much like watching an old Tarzan flick. If you, yourself, aren't racist I think you'll just sort of shake your head at the stupidity of it all and get a chuckle thinking about how angry the actors having to play the savages must have been.So, this is a throw-back movie. It isn't good acting, the plot is contrived and silly, the entire narrative seems to use stereotyped caricatures, and there's a guy in a gorilla suit. You can see why some people hate this movie.On the other hand, if you appreciate a good Hollywood safari-adventure flick, this one doesn't disappoint. In fact, it entertains.

It's an adventure that follows a group of scientists as they attempt to return a friendly gorilla to her natural habitat (in the Congo, would you believe?). Unfortunately, things don't go their way and they have to contend with everything from corrupt local soldiers to angry hippos and killer gorillas.It's one of those adventure movies that could - loosely - be put in the same category as the Indiana Jones movies. Don't get me wrong... it's nowhere near as good as Indy's outings, but, if you're looking for a fun movie that rolls along with plenty of action, then give this a go.I would say that the only major drawback came from the marketing. If you watch the trailers for it or read the write-up, all it talks about is how the team encounters hostile gorillas. That's the film's selling point. However, the said gorillas don't actually make an appearance until the last twenty-five minutes or so, so, by then, you may be wondering where they are.

It revolves around basically three themes - the scientist who goes to the jungle looking for her former fiancé, the primatologist who wants to return a talking gorilla to her native land and a treasure- hunter who's looking for King Solomon's lost city of diamonds. The three somehow manage to team up to support each other, and we spend significant time watching them traipse through the jungles, with precious little excitement or action taking place. Amy (the talking gorilla) is kind of cute, but I found it hard to believe that this obviously domesticated gorilla would be able to survive in the wild. Still, her story may be the only one of the three that has any appeal as you wonder whether - when the inevitable moment comes when she encounters wild gorilla - she'll choose her own species or the human she's come to love. Yeah. It's kind of a bizarre love story. The gorilla-creatures from the movie's beginning don't re-appear until the movie's last half hour or so, which means that there's essentially a lot - and I mean A LOT - of filler.The movie features some nice sceneries, but an unfortunately second-rate cast that seems to put enough effort into this but never really thoroughly convinces. Ernie Hudson is probably the most familiar face, supported by the likes of Laura Linney and Dylan Walsh and Joe Don Baker, who all work often enough but have never really achieved mega- stardom.

Meanwhile scientist Peter Elliot has taught a gorilla to speak with sign language but Amy is showing signs of distress and he must return her to the jungle. These two groups need to get into Zaire quickly and they are joined by a shadowy Romanian who offers funding if he can go along, but has mysterious reasons of his own for going.The term b movie is normally used to refer to something that is a bit cheesy but, for whatever reason, can be fun &#150; a guilty pleasure if you will. Films are often marketed on their b-movie cool and fans get off on how cheesy/bad/cool/unusual it is &#150; Samuel Jackson and Snakes on a Plane recently milked this to good effect. Congo is a b-movie and it ticks a lot of the boxes for things we expect from a modern b-movie cheesy effects, bad acting, terrible plotting and so on. All these are in place in this film where the plot is nonsense and the dialogue occasionally so bad that I believed I could see tears in the eyes of the actors. Sadly what it forgets to be is fun and, in playing it all totally straight, it mostly falls flat. I appreciate the film taking itself seriously but asking me to do the same was too much for it to expect. The stupid narrative was hard to care about and I was regularly bored. I haven't read Michael Crichton's book which this came from but it is hard to imagine that it is as bad as this. I give him the benefit of the doubt on that but Shanley's script has little of interest or value in it.I tried to be forgiving of the effects and monkey outfits but then I realised that this was made only 10 years ago and 2 years after Jurassic Park &#150; we had the technology, we just didn't have the will to use it in this case. It doesn't help that Marshall directs like it was a TV movie, while the sets themselves look cheap. The cast is impressive though and has lots of faces if not stars. In fact the real question is why so many people signed up to do this rubbish &#150; I know Crichton was hot property in the mid-90's so maybe they all thought they were making the next Jurassic Park. Linney and Walsh carry the story and my god but they struggle with it; they both are so sincere that it hurts that they are so wooden and weak. Hudson at least is a bit more relaxed and is better for it. Rosas' Amy is an annoying little ape and is the equivalent of having some cheesy brat in the cast. Campbell's presence confirms this as a b-movie, Akinnuoye-Agbaje has a before they were famous moment while both Lindo and Pantoliano wisely removed their names from this. Of course none of them compare to the sheer joy that is Tim Curry, short of glazing him and serving him with pineapple, it would be hard to imagine how he could have been a bigger ham. Taking his inspiration from Sesame Street's The Count he delivers a terrible accent, mangling his words and rambling on about Zinge. He didn't take it seriously at all and at least he brought fun and laughs.A terrible load of nonsense then, that has all the bad aspects of a modern b movie without more than a sliver of the fun. The effects are weak but are still more convincing than the majority of the cast who are wooden and unconvincing as the flat dialogue sticks in their throats. Only Tim Curry's absurd performance adds some so bad its good fun to the mix &#150; the rest of it is just so bad its bad.

It's a badly made film even though it's never boring. And boy did I laugh out loud while watching this! It's incredible at how unintetionally hilarious this movie is. Congo is a movie so ridiculous, so stupid, so idiotic, and so dumb that I found myself cracking up during many scenes. The plot of Congo is about an expedition that goes into the jungles of Africa who come face-to-face with killer gorillas. Since it's a waste of my time to explain the rest of the goofy plot, I just get down to what's good and bad about Congo. Here's the good stuff. As far as the cast goes, there are only two good performances turned in by Laura Linney as the communications expert looking for her fiance who's disappeared in the African jungle and Ernie Hudson as the group's tour guide. Plus, some of the African scenery looks beautiful with the cinematographer of E.T. (Allen Daviau) doing the honors here. Now here's the bad stuff (and there's alot of it). The worst acting honors for Congo go to Tim Curry who gives one of the most laughable film performances of all-time. Curry, speaking with a bad foreign accent, plays a Romanian fortune hunter obsessed with finding a long lost city that Hudson believes does not exist. Another silly character in the film is Amy the talking gorilla, who when having a special speaking device on talks with a schoolgirl voice that's sounds absolutely ridiculous. The screenplay by John Patrick Shanley (based on Michael Crichton's novel) has alot of preposterous dialogue. And it's hard to imagine that Frank Marshall directed this. Marshall, who's first directing effort was the very good horror/comedy Arachnophobia, is a protege of Steven Spielberg. Spielberg, Marshall, and Congo producer Kathleen Kennedy (Marshall's real-life wife) developed Spielberg's production company Amblin Entertainment during the '80s. Marshall as worked with Spielberg on some of the biggest box-office hits of all-time (he produced the Indiana Jones trilogy) and scored a huge box-office hit last year on his own as co-producer (with Kennedy) of The Sixth Sense. But I have no idea what Marshall was thinking of when he made Congo. It should have been a thrilling adventure tale but instead turns out to be a comedy of epic proportions. Marshall directed this as if it's a really serious movie. If it's supposed to be serious, why is it so funny? I was constantly laughing at the Tim Curry character because he's made out to be a nut; same goes for the talking gorilla. Congo has a couple of good things going for it, but it's just too ridiculous.*1/2 (out of four)  "},{"Title":"The best movie since Ishtar","Date":"19 July 2000","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Mystery","Review":" Friends, if ever there was a '1' on a '1-10' scale, this is it. This is as low as movie making sinks. So bad it will make you physically ill. As one reviewer wrote 'I'm actually angry it exists'. Symptoms that may occur while watching Congo include nervous twitching, shortness of breath, hairloss and an impending feeling of doom (as the end approaches and you realize what you've just done).In Congo, all the elements of bad film making come together in one place at one time putting you, if you are watching it, in the wrong place at the wrong time. The film has high production value, so there is no 'so bad it's good' factor, a stunningly bad screenplay (from an excellent book, no less) laughably bad make up/fx, ... pacing? what's that? Good actors acting like bad actors and bad actors being themselves, and cheesy sets that look like they were designed by Ed Wood. If you are contemplating watching Congo, let me save you some trouble; Drink a half bottle of Nyquil and 3 triple espressos. Have someone spin you as fast as they can on one of those spinny things on the playground. Smoke a cheap cigar and try to remember all you can about H.R. Puffinstuff, or the worst TV show you have ever seen. Now throw up. The latter is as good as Congo gets.

What's deeply unsettling about it is that Micheal Crichton is a great author, and most of his novels, especially this one, aren't transalated well onscreen.  The Andromeda Strain for instance, was one of the most riveting books I've ever read.  The movie seemed boring and tedious, and it also contained too many split-screen segments, which was normal in the 1960's.  Jurassic Park was arguably the best adaptation of one of his books to film.  Sure it wasn't as good as the book, but it was great fun and really exciting.  This seemed like one of those corny disaster flicks like Godzilla and Dante's Peak, with awful acting and characterization, with the exception of fantastic special effects.  The only thing that distinguishes this from those other films is that the effects are bad too, and this was based on the novel of a great author.  Okay, call me a sucker.  I do like some unfaithful adaptations of novels on film.  I thought Stanley Kubrick's version of Stephen King's The Shining was a masterpiece, despite the fact that the book and the film were very different.  Congo is hard to like.  I used to be into it though.  I saw it theatrically and rented it on video, once.  That was when I was before I was old enough to differentiate between art and crap.  It's nothing to get all that upset about.  It's just like one of those other bad special effects turds, but this was based on the novel, a good, well written novel, by Micheal Crichton.  That makes it worse.

Well, sorry to say, but the same goes for the film.Here's the plotGreed is bad, this simple morality tale cautions. A megalomaniacal C.E.O. (Joe Don Baker) sends his son into the dangerous African Congo on a quest for a source of diamonds large enough and pure enough to function as powerful laser communications transmitter (or is it laser weapons?). When contact is lost with his son and the team, his daughter-in-law (Laura Linney), a former CIA operative and computer-freak, is sent after them. On her quest, she is accompanied by gee-whiz gadgetry and a few eccentric characters (including a mercenary (Ernie Hudson), a researcher with a talking gorilla (Dylan Walsh), and a a nutty Indiana-Jones-type looking for King Solomon's Mines (Tim Curry). After some narrow escapes from surface-to-air missiles and some African wildlife, they all discover that often what we most want turns out to be the source of our downfall. The actors in this movie were not talented. Dylan Walsh acts like a pathetic crybaby, especially at the end; Ernie Hudson is unconvincing (is it no wonder he went on to star in TV films?) and Laura Linney is nothing special. I think I can safely say the only talented actors in this film had very small roles Joe Don Baker and Tim Curry, an always enjoyable actor (although sometimes scarred for life by constantly being reminded of his Rocky Horror Picture days). This movie also had some other problems, including awful direction style, cheesy dialogue and a just-plain-boring plot, which was completely hashed when compared to Crichton's novel. Not even Stan Winston's creature effects could save this movie from being a disaster. I am deeply disappointed in this movie; there was not even a campy quality to redeem itself with. It was just plain awful, cheesy, boring and ridiculous, and proves to be one of the worst Crichton book-to-film productions.2/5 stars -John Ulmer "},{"Title":"Novel BOFO BO.......film FLOPO PU!!!!!!!!!","Date":"18 March 2000","Score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Mystery","Review":"  This is one book, that should have stayed a book.
