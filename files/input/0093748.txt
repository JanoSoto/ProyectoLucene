Scenes such as those in the Bravewood Inn are classics. The argument between Neal and Del is the turning point in the film, and it is the first time that the audience realizes that they are in for more than they thought they were. There are certain elements of tenderness, heart, agony, conflict, and heartfelt emotion in Planes, Trains and Automobiles that make it transcend the genre. Steve Martin and John Candy don't just act; they embody themselves so deeply in their characters that it almost sets a standard for how comedic pairings should be. Line them up next to Chris Farley and David Spade and the differences are astronomical. Watching Steve Martin is like acting a comedian at the top of his game. Just watch his reactions. The facial reaction from Steve in response to Del's comeback in the Bravewood Inn is perfect; we understand what Neal is going through, and Steve Martin lets us know this by placing himself in a recognizable area. We also understand Del, and that is really the key to this movie Being able to identify with both characters almost equally. How often can you say that about buddy pictures? I don't ever feel much sympathy for Chris Farley, if that means anything.John Candy remains one of the most underrated and underwritten film comedians of all time. Offered constant mediocre scripts during the eighties and early nineties, all the way up until his death in 1994, he could make the material something more, something watchable. I recently viewed Funny Farm, a painfully unfunny film to sit through. I imagined what John Candy could have done with Chevy Chase's role, and I found myself laughing. Why? Because John Candy can make anything watchable. Just how many times would you watch Summer Rental or The Great Outdoors if the lead actor was Jim Carrey?There's some important content in this film, but it is never overpowered by laughs, nor vice versa. They go hand-in-hand. I come back to the Bravewood Inn argument scene. After the hilarious, ongoing insults Neal throws at Del, Del responds and says, You wanna hurt me? Go right ahead if it makes you feel any better. I'm an easy target. Yeah, you're right, I talk too much. But I also listen too much. I could be a cold-hearted cynical like you, but I don't like to hurt people's feelings. So you go right on and think what you like about me. But I'm not changing. I - I like me. My wife likes me. My customers like me. 'Cause I'm the real deal. Whatcha see is whatcha get. It's creepy how much dramatic, emotional and truthful subtext sneaks into this film, and yet it only makes it all the better for it. Planes, Trains and Automobiles is my favorite Comedy, yes I know that I have said it before. But, it is a serious comedy that has both heart and is hilarious at the same time. Entertainment at it's best. And isn't that what movies are all about? 5/5 stars.

He really was. Never was his talent on display better than it was in this film. John Hughes and John Candy went on to develop what I can only surmise was quite the friendship because Candy appeared in many Hughes films either as the star ( this one, Uncle Buck, Great Outdoors ) or with a cameo ( Home Alone, Vacation and a few others that I can't think of right now, but check the IMDb and you'll see that he did ). But of all the films that Candy did, including Stripes, I don't think he has ever been as good and as funny as he was in here. If there was any justice in the Academy ( and we all know that is an oxymoron, Academy and justice ) then Candy would have at least been nominated for best actor in 1987. I think Douglas won that year for Wall Street and he deserved to but Candy was brilliant in this film. It was a shame to see his career cut short because even in his bad films he was good. This is his best and most complete role. He will be missed but at least we have great roles like this to remember him by.Planes.... is a film about one man trying to get home for the American Thanksgiving. He is Neil Page and he is played with perfect smugness by Steve Martin. He is a work-a-holic and his lifestyle is that of many John Hughes family men that live in suburbia Chicago. He lives in a huge house, much like the one in Home Alone and Weird Science, and his family is a beautiful one that consists of a lovely wife and three kids. But he is never home and for all of his success professionally, it is the kind of family that although is together now, it may not survive the fast approaching 90's if Neil Page continues his ways.John Candy plays Dell Griffith. He is a jolly man, much like Santa Clause but without the beard and the old age. This is a man that carries a giant trunk around with him and is a constant chatter box. He is the kind of man that you know is good at sales, but on a lower level. He is too much of a slob to really be a corporate sales guy. Of course this Laurel and Hardy pair cross paths and from here on out Neil's simple task of getting home to his family for Thanksgiving is going to be a journey from hell.First of all he loses his cab in New York rush hour to Candy who unwittingly steals it from him, then he is bumped from first class and ends up sitting next to Candy on the plane. Then they are delayed because of weather problems and what do you know, they end up spending the night together in not only the same hotel, not only the same room but the same bed. This presents all sorts of comic possibilities and Hughes doesn't miss one of them. His comic timing and development of the two characters is brilliant. Some of the best scenes are when the two are bantering and Candy is verbally assaulted by Martin. Martin goes off and says that he is annoying to listen to and then he says this  You know I could sit through an insurance seminar and still look happy and the others would say how do you do it? And I would say, because I can take anything, I've been with Dell Griffith, and they'd say,  I know what you mean. Whooooo, shower curtain guy!  And as funny as that scene is, Hughes goes for more than the quick payoff of laughter. He then reminds you that this isn't just a comedy but a film with many layers and substance to it. Because the next scene has Candy delivering a monologue that almost makes you embarrassed for laughing at what Martin said.But truth be told, first and foremost, this is a funny, funny film. And if anyone has scene it, they will tell you about the airport scene where Page has lost his rental car and he comes back and does what we have all dreamed of doing ourselves, he goes ballistic on the person behind the desk, who subsequently is Grace, from Ferris Bueller's Day Off. She must have been fired by Ed Rooney and now rents cars at airports for a living. She plays a desk clerk that has decided to take the Thanksgiving holiday a little sooner that she is supposed to. Martin comes in and she starts by saying, Can I help you? Martin replies, You can start by wiping that f***ing dumbass smile off your rosy f@**ing cheeks.  From there he goes into an F-Word filled tirade about how her company left him in the middle of f***ing nowhere with f****ing keys to a f***ing car that isn't f***ing there. It is one of the funniest moments that I have seen in any film because you don't expect it from a Hughes film.Planes... is a heart warming film about family, friendship and good will towards men. It is also a wickedly funny movie and it will stand the test of time and I think in 30 or 40 years from now, it may be looked upon as Hughes best film. Candy and Martin are wonderful in here and it is really a treat to watch them work together.10 out of 10 "},{"Title":"The best Thanksgiving movie ever!","Date":"1 December 2005","Score":"75 out of 87 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" When jittery advertising executive Neal Page (Steve Martin) is trying to go home for Thanksgiving, he gets stuck with boorish shower ring salesman Del Griffith (John Candy).

When his plane is diverted to Wichita due to heavy snow elsewhere he finds himself partnering up with shower curtain salesman Del Griffith.  However Del is not Neal's immediate first choice for travelling partner and the two soon find that one misfortune after another wears their patience very thin.While comedies have moved on to become more grosser and outrageous in order to tickle our dulled funny bone, PT&A manages it with what now seems like restraint but is really a good example of `wacky&#153;' comedy, mixed with a good vein of sentiment and character.  The plot is pretty good although some of it pushes the boat out to the unreal in order to get laughs &#150; but this isn't a problem because it DOES get laughs, if it hadn't then it might have been an issue.  Most of it is hilarious although some drags early on.The deeper beauty of the film is how well controlled Hughes is in painting his emotions.  Usually his stuff can be sickly sweet but here he mixes it well with the comedy.  The relationship between Neal and Del is good and they both have things to learn (more so Neal), the hurt they inflict on one another is well done and not to the point that the comedy is stopped.  Thankfully the two actors are good enough to carry it off.  Martin is close to his manic best and Candy plays a loveable goof.  The best scene to see them working is when Martin is laying into Del in the hotel room &#150; the expressions on their faces (Candy esp) during this makes it hard not to feel anything.  The support cast do good work whether it be now-famous cameos or just support cast but each character has their own little thing!Overall I worry that modern audiences may have become so used to everything being so OTT and gross that this film may seem subtle (even though it isn't).  However aside from that this is a very funny film that does have a good heart.  Not a perfect film in any way but it does exactly what it says on the tin - it made me laugh hard but also had a believable emotional core.

Critics didn't like it, but I found the sudden bursts of rock 'n roll interesting and it added to the enjoyment of watching this almost-modern day classic.After all the aggravation, there was a nice sentimental touch at the end which somehow made the whole disastrous trip worthwhile for the two leading characters.

There's no better way to explain Martin and Candy, but truly funny.  They are the ultimate odd couple.  The up tight Neal Page (Martin) is a workaholic, just trying to see his family for Thanksgiving.  When he runs into Del Grifith (John Candy), Neil learns  to laugh and unwind.  They couldn't be more wrong for each other. 	Through all the busyness of New York, it's ironic how two opposite people could possibly meet each other and become friends.  Especially when they are so different and couldn't like one another any less.  Del is a carefree, easy going, curtain ring sales men, that seems to have no problems in life.  Though he hides one tearful secret, he keeps you laughing until the end.  	When Neal is in such a hurry to get home for Thanksgiving with his family, he just has to have everything go wrong.  It doesn't help that Neal is an overly obsessive, business man with no other purpose in life but to work and go home.  After several attempts to never see each other again, Del and Neal learn to spend their trip together.  After hopping from planes, trains and automobiles, a simple trip soon turns into quite an adventure, for the two odd friends. 	The fine acting and natural raw comedy between Martin and Candy adds an addicting appeal to the movie.  The movie is rated R for the language that the characters use through the entire movie.  Although that is what makes the movie so funny.  It's a great ****ing movie!  The film would probably appeal more towards an older audience because of the `intense' language used,  though the film still holds a wholesome quality about it.  It's a warm hearted film with lots to laugh about.  The laughter of the film keeps you drawn in until the end, when the more serious nature of the film is displayed.  `Planes, Trains and Automobiles' deserves a 7 out of 10.  "}{"Title":"Simply the best","Date":"20 May 2005","Score":"17 out of 20 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" This is simply the greatest Humour movie ever.Most people would call it a comedy, and boy it certainly is, but it is so much more than that. Sure, on the surface it is brilliant slapstick with scenes so hysterically funny they make you roll off your chair. If ever there was a laugh-aloud movie this is it, and it ranks right up there with classics like Blazing Saddles, Return of the Pink Panther and Monty Python's Holy Grail. Even if it didn't go any deeper than this, Steve Martin and John Candy perform a comic feat that wouldn't put Laurel and Hardy to shame.But the strength of the movie is that just below this surface it plays out a very human drama. The two main characters, Neal Page (Steve Martin) and Dale Griffith (John Candy) are polar opposites. Neal is introvert, anal retentive, arrogant and ambitious, a typical stressed-out corporate middle-manager who works in New York away from his family in Chicago. Dale is a simple salesman, obese, extravert, uninhibited, a social animal with friends in every town. They find themselves bound together by fate on a journey from New York to Chicago two days before Thanksgiving where everything that can possibly go wrong does go wrong.As you would expect, the involuntary close relation of such disparate characters initially causes massive friction. Neal can't stand Dale's physical presence nor his endless pointless chatter, Dale is not impressed by Neal's arrogant stiffness and his not-so-subtle attempts to get rid of him. Yet, they need each other to reach their objective and they know it. Some brilliant scenes play out this confrontation, but in the end they come to grudingly accept each other, and through their trials and tribulations on the road acceptance even grows into something resembling a budding respect. Steve Martin and John Candy are fantastic, their chemistry fuels the movie and raises it to a level well above standard comedy.*************** Spoilers ahead *********************** But the film goes deeper yet. At the next level, there is underlying tragedy that both characters try to hide in their day to day existence. It turns out that Dale has lost his wife eight years before, and has in fact been wandering and travelling throughout the country without ever going back home. He is effectively homeless and lives in cheap hotels and motels out of a trunk (which by the way also acts as a very effective comic prop), but he never discloses this to Neal. His life contains a great emotional emptiness but he can't really face up to it and he pretends to be a happily married man. Neal, on the other hand, is so self-obsessed with his career that he sacrifices the love for his family to the point where his wife becomes mistrusting of what is going on. Here is a man who risks losing what really matters for the sake of shallow success. He vaguely understands that something is going wrong but can't get himself to admit it or even pause and think about it.It is only when the two of them get paired up that they come to realise what is wrong with themselves. Dale is confronted with Neal's family life, a life that he himself so sorely misses, and Neal realises in the end that life is about more than himself and that other people do matter. At the conclusion of the film they come together and fulfill each other's needs, becoming whole in the process.This is buddy movie/ road flick supreme. The tragedy underlying the superficial slapstick makes this film Humour with a Capital H, much more so than the great comedies I mentioned before. You will have to go back to the likes of Charles Chaplin and Buster Keaton to find anything comparable.However, and this is where the true greatness lies, in the final analysis this film is not about the drama of two different characters at all, but about the opposing forces struggling within each of us ourselves. We all have a Neal and a Dale side, apparent opposites that cannot exist together, but only by accepting this and giving both sides equal weight can we become whole human beings. The film shows that this may at first appear an impossible task, frought with risk and danger, but if we persevere it can be done, and the prize of healing ourselves is worth it.Hilarious comedy, superb drama and ground truth - few movies would even dare to try and combine these themes. Planes, trains and automobiles does, and it succeeds brilliantly. Martin and Candy deliver stellar performances that work at all of these levels. Definitely one of the best movies ever, and vastly underrated.

I've gotten very interested in the subject lately, as my increasingly long bicycle adventures have led to an interest in seeing the country from the saddle of a bicycle, and Kurmaskie references Planes, Trains and Automobiles to emphasize a point he makes about the freaky things that can happen to you while traveling, particularly by bus.Steve Martin and John Candy play well off of each other, and it's interesting to note how many weak gimmicks are in the movie and yet how well it pulls it off. You have the traditional odd couple, they run into each other constantly among millions of people, for the sake of the plot, of course, and are such polar opposites that it's impossible not to see the inspiration that the movie took from the classic Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau film, The Odd Couple. But just when you begin to think that the movie is following an easily predicted formula, you get something thrown in that really catches you off guard, like the scene where Neal (Steve Martin) finally jumps out of bed, fed up with Del's (John Candy) inability to lie still and sleep, and yells at him extensively about every single little thing that he hates about him.It's strange that this can be such a hilarious scene for Martin, similar to Chevy Chase's temper tantrum over his Christmas bonus in National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, and yet we get cutaways to Del's face that are truly moving. He listens silently to Neal's endless stream of harsh criticisms, and he just watches, his face registering his inability to argue with any of it, and leaving the audience to wonder why we're laughing so hard at this guy who is obviously being hurt. And it's not even that the movie makes you look back at yourself with scenes like this, but that the characters are made so effectively three-dimensional. (spoilers) Del is an overly outgoing character who is sociable to a fault. He just wants to make conversation and make friends but ends up annoying instead. Kind of like that line in The Cable Guy, 'I just wanted to be your friend, Steven, but I screwed it up.' Carrey had won the audience's heart with that one line, but sadly, the remainder of the movie allowed the character to rescind any sympathy. This guy doesn't need a friend, he needs a criminal psychiatrist. Del, on the other hand, badly needs a friend, as we find out later in the movie.As a whole, the movie is about the strenuous things that happen during the holidays. Rather than focus on the difficulties in dealing with the extended family, as was the case in Christmas Vacation, this one focuses on traveling hazards. Three years later writer and Director John Hughes wrote Home Alone, in which John Candy reappears in a similar situation and plays almost exactly the same character. Here, Neal's inability to get on a single plane flight leads to a two-day nightmare involving planes, trains, automobiles and Del Griffith.As is to be expected, this odd couple grows on each other, as they always do, but the movie manages to escape being just another odd couple movie for a variety of reasons. First, there is not resentment and dislike coming from both sides, only an irrational one coming from Neal's side. He has already judged this guy long before he knew him, and it is only Del that is willing to make conversation and simply get along, despite their differences and the difficulty of their situation. I especially loved that the movie did not cop out at the end, which it could very easily have done. It takes two people who could hardly have been more different, puts them together for a matter of days in an extremely stressful situation, and then brings them together at the end without compromising the validity of their characters. It is certainly a bittersweet ending, but one that leaves you with a smile.

For some reason, Thanksgiving is a neglected holiday in terms of movie-making. That being said, there is one Thanksgiving movie that not only is far and above the best of its kind, it also stands as one of the greatest holiday pictures of all-time. Planes, Trains, and Automobiles was John Candy at his best, Steve Martin at his best, and also writer/director John Hughes at his absolute prime. Mixing classic slapstick with outstanding dialogue, masterpiece moments, and a heavy dosage of heart that slowly builds then delivers towards the end, this 1987 film never preaches and never slows down a second. Every five minute a conflict arises, usually leading to a hilarious conclusion but lessons learned from the two main characters. This is a must see every fourth Thursday in November.In Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, a bumbling cynical marketing success story (Steve Martin) meets a talkative yet helpful and loving traveling salesman (John Candy) as they both embark on a road trip across the snow-infested United States to reach Chicago in time for Thanksgiving. All sorts of transportation are used, but they are all failing and letting down the two main characters for different reasons. Flights are being delayed, trains are breaking down, traffic is heavy, car rental places aren't being reliable, and vehicles are fighting against Mother Nature. John Hughes is the sole writer in this tale, and manages to deliver plenty of laughs, one-liners and complications in a short 93 minutes. Throughout all the troubles, Neal and Del learn a lot about each other, and a bit more about themselves.Steve Martin and John Candy were decent before, but absolutely delivered in this movie. Both fit their roles perfectly well; as we see Steve Martin at his funniest and angriest, and John Candy in his most down-to-earth role. Neither of the two ever stole the spotlight, they each shared incredible moments; whether it's the close encounter with two trucks, waking up together very close, or driving a car obviously not fit for the road. Individually, they each had one classic moment; with Martin's tirade at a rental place and Candy singing Ray Charles by himself while driving. There was such an amazing balance in this movie, it would be years before we see such chemistry amongst the main two stars in a film (See Dumb and Dumber in 1994).John Hughes, known for his teen comedies that mesh hilarity with angst and heart, reached his quality peak here. He successfully combines comedy and drama for adults, and packs layers of emotion within 93 minutes. One can dissect this movie and realize it's much deeper than it looks from the outside. One has to see the movie a second time, because some of the elements make more sense after seeing the ending. And what can I say about the ending? It was a quiet and gradual build up, then unleashes in the final moments in such a surprising manner. Martin and Candy prove that they can do drama just as well as comedy in the final five minutes. Decades later, it still stands as one of the most underrated and most unexpected endings you'll ever see. After laughing until you are teary-eyed within the first 80-something minutes, your throat will suddenly swell up upon seeing certain revelations and ugly truths.Bottom Line No more discussion, I think I've said enough about this film; if you have seen this movie, I am basically preaching to the choir as to how good this film is. Otherwise, you better drop everything and watch this movie now. It presents an amazing story about family, about people, about life's sudden curveballs. There isn't a better Thanksgiving movie within a country mile and this is leagues above the average holiday movie, and this does include It's a Wonderful Life, any Christmas Carol movie you can come up with, and Hughes' most successful work; which was Home Alone. The acting, writing, directing, pacing, and amount of sentimentality is incredible, as we see the best work of two veteran actors and an acclaimed writer. Bring the family and friends (and some tissue paper), and prepare for a delightful experience. Recommend to the highest degree, as movies that can age well and tug the heartstrings decades after its release deserve more praise and more viewings.

Most of these were very good, but Planes, Trains & Automobiles was a nice change of pace. The pairing up of Steve Martin and John Candy was an inspired choice, and these two great actors turn the film into a comedy masterpiece.Normally, I can't stand Steve Martin, because in almost everything I've seen him in, he goes completely over the top. But his performance in PTA changed my outlook of him. He plays Neal Page, a snobbish, cynical advertising executive in New York, who is going home to Chicago for Thanksgiving. The film is called Planes, Trains & Automobiles because these are the means of transportation Neal has to go through to get home.Desperately late for his plane home, there is an hilarious scene at the beginning where he makes a mad dash for a taxi with Kevin Bacon (making a cameo). Unfortunately, Neal loses out, and then loses a second taxi stolen by John Candy. He plays Del Griffith, a shower curtain ring salesman, who is also on his way to the airport.The two of them properly meet at the airport after Neal's flight is delayed. I like this scene because they both recognise each other from somewhere, but can't quite place where. Neal then has the bad luck of being seated next to Del on the plane. At some point in our lives, we've all met someone like Del Griffith. Someone who is over friendly, chatty, and a real pest. But they're so full of the best of intentions you don't have the heart to tell them to leave you alone.Just when it looks like things can't get any worse for Neal, the flight is then cancelled. So begins the hysterical chain of events of Neal's odyssey to get home.Now stuck with Del, who wants to help Neal, our hapless duo go from one disaster after another to get to Chicago. Steve Martin and John Candy make a great double act, because although they seem like the archetypal Odd Couple, there are more complexities to their relationship then at first thought.One of the best scenes is when they are forced to spend a night in a motel. Del's slobbish behaviour finally drives Neal to explode. He begins ranting about how boring Del is, and what a real failure he is. In short, Del is nothing but a plague on humanity.What is so good about this scene, is at first you are chuckling at Neal pointing out Del's shortcomings. But Del looks so genuinely hurt your sympathies start to switch to Del instead of Neal. Then something very unexpected happens, when Del tells Neal (and the audience) something I thought was very movingYou wanna hurt me? Go right ahead if it makes you feel any better. I'm an easy target. Yeah you're right. I talk too much. I also listen too much. I could be a cold hearted cynic like you... but I don't like to hurt people's feelings. You can say what you like about me; I'm not changing. Me... I like me. My wife likes me. My customers like me. 'Cause I'm the real article. What you see is what you get.This scene alone speaks volumes about the personalities of these two men. You begin to really feel sorry for Del, because he seems like a lonely man. And Neal is not such a nice person after all. He doesn't mind insulting people if it makes him feel better. But still, the laughs come thick and fast afterwards. One of the most hysterical scenes is when Neal mouths off at a car rental saleswoman after being dumped in the middle of nowhere. I've never heard so many F words in one sentence. This had to have been what gave the film its 15 certificate. Its possible Hughes inserted this scene to make it clearer to the audience PTA is more adult-oriented than his previous films.Del and Neal end up sharing a rental car, and they manage to completely wreck it. They are nearly killed by two trucks, and the funniest part is when Del appears as the Devil to Neal. Everything just seems to be conspiring against them. Gradually, the two men start to become friends. What's satisfying is it doesn't feel artificial. It feels like its been building up to it. This is due to John Hughes' slick direction. Neal and Del are two men who are both social misfits for different reasons. Neal is too organised and structured to relate to others, and Del tries so hard to make friends he often ends up alienating them.Despite all the disasters that befall them, they do make it to Chicago. This is where the film takes on a more serious tone, but doesn't lessen the enjoyment. Del has a secret he hasn't told Neal concerning his wife, but I won't reveal it for those who haven't seen the film.The ending is very touching, and a little sad too. But you have grown to like both Neal and Del by the end of the film. Both of them realise things about themselves. Neal learns to be more tolerant and kind, and Del learns not to be so overbearing with his friendliness. The film ends with where their friendship will lead to, and its probably best left that way.Its a pity Steve Martin and John Candy couldn't have made more films, because they worked so well together. This is my favourite Steve Martin film, and it never seems mawkish or cloying in any way. A great little study into the personality changes you can go through on the road. I always notice something different to this film every time I watch it. This was the best film John Candy ever made. There is so much of him in Del. R.I.P. John Candy.

He adds such sensitivity and sweetness to the role that it takes this movie from a rolling in the aisles comedy, to a sweet and tender story about two strangers overcoming their character flaws to walk in each others shoes for a moment.To be sure, it's hilariously funny and I never tire of the gags and pratfalls every time I see it. But for me, it's more about what these two men learn about themselves and from each other.This one is a real charmer, and while you can view it anytime, it seems especially apropos at Thanksgiving.

Neil Page (Steve Martin) is looking at his boarding pass, for his flight home to  Chicago.  He is Tapping on his watch (Rolex) lip sinking to his co worker across the table, `I got to go!' The two men are in the meeting room trying to get a client (William Windham) to buy  an advertisement for their marketing agency.   Next scene, Neil Page is leaving the office building,  hoping that he will make his flight which is  ½ an hour away.  He is having trouble finding a cab during rush hour , so he negotiates with a stranger and pays $75 for a cab.  While all that is happening, the cab takes off, and Neil gets up to the cab opens up the door, and tells the passenger (John Candy) to get out  of the cab, just then the cab takes off, leaving Neil behind.  This is Neil Page's first encounter with Dell Griffith, the shower curtain ring salesman. Eventually  Neil Makes it to the air port just in time to find his flight delayed.  Sitting in the crowded airport, he notices a large man seated opposite him. The two look at each other for a few seconds until they figure out that they some how know each other. Neil tells him you stole you stole my cab at the same time Dell says `You're the guy who tried to take my cab'.  When it  occurs to Dell that it was pretty easy to get a cab that day during rush hour in New York City, he tries to make it up to Neil. Neil just wants to forget about it.   After every one boards the plane, Neil finds he has been bumped from first class. To ad insult to injury not only does he have to fly coach, but he has to sit in the middle seat next to Dell Griffith. Things could not get much worse, right? The flight to Chicago was routed to Wichita due to a snow storm in Chicago. While Neil was trying to book a room, and couldn't get one, Dell said `I booked a room at the Braidwood inn.'  and invited Neil to share a cab ride with him to the hotel. After an interesting cab ride, the two arrive at a hotel for the night., and the funny adventure starts there.  Neil specializes in marketing, and Dell specializes in selling the best shower curtain rings.  They have one thing in common. Both  are trying to get back to Chicago for thanksgiving.  	Although the men are very different from one another in personality, their misfortunes seal a  bond between them.  As they try to make the way home, they find various means of transportation, including a train, a bus, a pickup truck a burned out car and a refrigerated truck. They also find themselves on another journey. Neil Page makes the journey from career minded advertising executive to a more soft hearted person and Dell Griffith realizes that he has been a screw up who annoys people. Eventually the two make it back to Chicago, but they not only have completed the journey home, they have also completed the journey to a lasting friendship. 	 	Steve martin does an excellent job playing Neil Page, a business man in his late thirties early forties, who can be a bit of a control freak. Dell Griffith  is played by john Candy.  Who in turn is about the same age. Dell a salesman, is more relaxed then Neil. He can be really funny, and a disgusting slob at the same time.  Although  I do not recollect the two being in a motion picture before with each other, I am glad that they were chosen to act with each other because their interaction with each other is what made the story so interesting.  	The reviewer would rate this movie a five out of five star rating.  Though Steve Martin repeatedly dropped the F-Bomb in one scene, it is understandable when you see this well mannered man, who has met every inconceivable obstacle n his quest to spend Thanksgiving with his family finally  meet the limit of his patience. It is a classic to show around Thanksgiving time.  The way in which the movie was shot, and the acting was done, it brought out the highlights in the real funny scenes.  Go see for your self to realize what a great movie it is. Just a reminder, the next time your flight is delayed or you have trouble getting a cab, things could be worse. You could be traveling with a shower curtain ring salesman named Dell Griffith.

Anyone who has been treated like crap at the airport needs to own this movie. It earns its R rating for one scene where Neil turns into Scarface after being left miles from the terminal with a missing rental car as the company's bus drives blithely away as he chases it yelling. Sorry, it is vulgar but the F bombs have never demonstrated the efficacy of the word better in a movie. The movie follows two men, complete existential opposites, forced to be companions growing to become friends quite slowly I might add. Neil detests Dell for the majority of the movie until the end, starting with Dell costing him the cab that would have got him to his plane on time with his giant chest on the ground. Dell is a motor mouth who would get on anyone's nerves. A shower curtain ring salesman whose banter is unceasing until Neil snaps several times. It has a homophobic scene where there must share a bed at a booked up motel with some music and raised eyebrows, by Candy, and where they freak each other out waking up in each other's arms. They talk about football right away. You should be aware of the scene it offended some people, even back here, though the F Bomb tirade was the focal point of attack.The movie is full of hilarious scenes, the two play off of each other well; usually Dell takes advantage of Neil for money and they end up in a big mess anyway. The scene where Dell insults the Cabby dispatcher outside the terminal and he picks Neil up by his gonads is very funny. He has a very high voice the next few minutes. The dialog is consistently witty. Like all John Hughes' movies, he deepens the movie greatly near the ending with the revelation that Dell is a widower and he is all alone. Neil, finally riding home to his family, revisits all of the cryptic comments that Dell made over the course of their journey; he comes back to the deserted train station to find Dell sitting all alone. The scene of Neil taking Dell to his home for Thanksgiving is what gave this the moral depth it needed to become a Thanksgiving tradition in our home decades ago. The two comedians work very well with each other; I am not a big Steve Martin fan, this is the only film I own with him in the movie.The movie was castigated by reviewers as being anti family by having the F bomb airport scene that earned it the R Rating. Really, it is the only objectionable scene in the entire movie. Parents, just hit the chapter skip button you won't miss anything critical to the plot. The homophobia may offend gay people; it is a very small scene, I thought I should point it out. I love the movie, sorry, including the airport revenge scene, for it showing caring for a stranger. Not something you find everyday in a American movie, the bringing Dell home so he isn't alone on Thanksgiving deepens the movie from being an arid surface comedy. I know, the F bombs may bug you in a family comedy but when you see Neil's two mile hike back to the airport terminal, falling down the side of the highway into the mud, it becomes understandable. By the time he gets there, his face is covered with dirt and cut up. Forgive me, sometimes the F bomb is called for situationally. This is one of those moments.

In the scramble to get home for Thanksgiving, and because of a massive snowstorm that closes O'Hare Airport in Chicago and diverts them to Wichita, Neal and Del become unlikely travel companions as they hit the road for Chicago in a variety of modes of transportation.As we follow their misadventures, this becomes a very funny movie. In a strange way, both characters are equally likable and not. Neal's a good family guy who just wants to be with his family for the holidays, but he's also unforgiving and unsympathetic to others, not to mention a bit snobbish. Del talks too much and has far too many irritating habits, but he is who he is and - as he says - he likes himself and he likes people, but there's also a sadness to him that makes you want to know more about him. Martin and Candy played off each other perfectly, and there are many absolutely hilarious moments throughout. I think my favourite scene is as they travel the wrong way down the highway. Ultimately, the mystery about Del's life and Del's wife is revealed, which leads to a very touching scene at the movie's close, as Neal is moved to invite Del to his home and family for Thanksgiving.In a movie I enjoyed very much, the only thing I didn't like was the scene in which Neal loses his cool with the car rental agent and spews forth an ongoing chain of the f-word at her. I realize this scene has to be looked at in context. I realize it presented an interesting view of the character finally losing it, but to me - although I'm no prude - it was far too out of character for Neal and too out of place when compared to the rest of the movie.

He misses his flight thanks to a shower curtain rod ring salesman, Del Griffith (John Candy).Then, it begins. Dealing with the Thanksgiving rush home, they become stranded and decide to trek together across the U.S. using planes, then trains, then automobiles (but the title leaves out use of the bus).Very much like National Lampoon's Vacation, the audience can laugh because we can identify with layovers, losing wallets, messed up car rentals, being robbed, and all the other travel frustrations. The best thing is we can laugh at it because it is not us.The story comes off as believable, even though Murphy's Law seems to apply for every situation. The two players, though, make the trip worthwhile, funny, and credible.Steve Martin does depart from his usual comedic lead role to be the straight man. It is refreshing to see him as an uptight and straight-laced jerk instead of the wild and crazy guy he is known for. However, he may do something that may make the audience uncomfortable dislike him. He is not one to loathe, but more to pity as he comes off as self-righteous, angry, selfish, and impatient. The real breakthrough performance, though, is John Candy. Usually plagued with mediocre scripts and being shoved into a supporting role, Candy finally shines through as a good, sincere-hearted person who is socially immature. Candy gives the buffoon earnestness, and depth. An audience will love him like loving an immature child, hoping him to grow &#x85; and being grateful he is not part of our lives.The crowning jewel, though, is the chemistry between the Candy and Martin. Their talent meshes well together, thanks to the direction of Hughes. This all culminates to a dramatic, bittersweet ending that will hopefully leave the audience hopeful and teary-eyed.Yes, Hughes was the master of teen angst.

Unfortunately, the flight is delayed over an hour and when Neal can finally get on the plane, he's bumped down from first class to coach. To make matters worse, he got a seat beside Del who talked constantly throughout the flight. Well severe weather in Chicago closed the airport so Del and Neal's plane landed in Wichita, Kansas. Del was a shower curtain salesman and one of his closest customers, Gus, ran a motel where they could stay. There was only one room left which had a double bed. Neal and Del slept together and grew more and more aggravated with one another. Since air travel seemed inconvenient, they would next go by train so Gus's son, Owen, gives them a ride to the train station.

En route, the train blows it's top and they have to stop. Neal and Del meet up again and hike to town and board a bus to St. Louis where they decide to go their separate ways. Neal get's a rental car that has mysteriously disappeared, but luckily Del got a car so they meet up again and drive to Chicago. The drive is not uneventful. Del breaks the passenger seat adjuster and when trying to fling his cigarette out the window, it lands in the back seat. Also, when Del's coat sleeves are caught on the seat, they veer off the freeway and get back on going the wrong direction and are nearly wiped out by two big rigs. What's more, the car catches on fire. Neal and Del get out in time, but Neal's wallet was in the glove compartment! They stay at a motel for the night and in the morning, drive their burnt and scratched car down the highway, but were then cited for driving an unsafe vehicle. Luckily they make it to the subway station. Neal learns that Del has no family so he invites him to his house for Thanksgiving. The family is delighted to meet Del, who finally feels like he's wanted.           This movie was funny. Steve Martin and John Candy were great together. If you like John Candy, I also recommend Uncle Buck, also directed by John Hughes. Hughes also produced Home Alone, also starring John Candy. Sadly John Candy passed away due to a heart attack in 1994. He will be missed. Also in the cast is Dylan Baker as Owen who recently flushed his career down the toilet by starring on The Pitts. A funny scene is when Neal is swearing at the rental car lady. Another good scene is when Neal and Del are driving on the freeway and meet one disaster after another.

Among the best of his films are Home Alone and The Breakfast Club, but they still make John Hughes look like an immature stereotype. Sadly, the brat pack films were what defined comedies of the 1980s, while films like A Fish Called Wanda, Clue and this one, remained underlooked.At some point in his career, Hughes must have realized that he was better than the films he was confined to, so he decided to make an adult-oriented film. That turned out to be, Planes, Trains and Automobiles. What a fantastic movie this is! Spawning so many inferior imitators and numerous clichés, this movie was and still is comic gold. The scene at the hotel, going the wrong way down the interstate and, of course, the car rental scene, have become staples in American culture. Hilarious comedy, superb drama and ground truth - few movies would even dare to try and combine these themes. Planes, trains and automobiles does, and it succeeds brilliantly. Martin and Candy deliver stellar performances that work at all of these levels. Definitely one of the best movies ever, and vastly underrated. The real strength of the movie is that just below the surface, the chemistry of the two leads. The two can be hilarious and heartwarming at the same time, and some parts are genuinely hilarious, others genuinely tragic. The ending of this film brought tears to my eyes. PTAA is a drama and a comedy, but the drama is so subtle that you don't notice it at first. Unlike other dramadies which smother the film in drama and ultimately fall flat on their face, PTAA is the real deal. I could go and sum up the entire film for you, but I can't do that. This is a film that must be experienced. And since everyone else has either ratted out the ending or described the plot to a T, there's no need for my involvement, so that's that. John Candy gives his best performance here (and his personal favorite), going from gut busting hilarity to somber loneliness the next scene. It's truly an amazing performance. Steve Martin gives another great performance, as a man so consumed with cheap success that he lets it control his life. The fact that this film takes place at Thanksgiving is no coincidence. The whole movie is about not taking your life for granted, as Martin's character is doing. Candy's character has little yet he is one of the happiest people you'll ever meet. At the end of the film, Martin's character learns that he has to appreciate what he has before it is gone, and Del even remarks You're a lucky guy, Neal., to which Martin responds I know. PTAA is a simply hilarious comedy as well as a superb drama. Might I also add that the film's soundtrack is marvelous, and only helps this film to succeed brilliantly.

The premise is simple, ancient and grossly overused but Planes, Trains And Automobiles is so uproariously funny that I'd chuck all the bygones right out of the window and delve into a bucket of popcorn and invest into this hoot of a comedy. Hughes has always been one of my favorite filmmakers, a productive artist of his time and a virtuoso of movies on teenage angst. No matter how hard my day was, I'd just watch a John Hughes movie to cheer myself up because he knows how to do it better than anyone else.We open in New York City two days before Thanksgiving. Neal Page (Steve Martin), a compulsive snob and a marketing executive, yawns through a meeting with his bosses. He's desperate to make a flight he's late for so that he could spend Thanksgiving with his family. He been told that he'd 'never make it', a challenge he takes on only to have a cab that he has paid for being stolen from right under his nose. Neal's a frustrated exec, he wears neatly-cut suits that compliment his grave demeanor. Martin's perfect cast as Neal. He can play a dignified working-man in one frame and an angry elitist in the other. That's what happens when he has his cab nicked. The culprit is Del Griffith (John Candy), a traveling salesman who sells shower-rings, who apologizes profusely to an incensed Neal later on when they meet on the flight. He wants to make up for it, Neal would rather be left alone. But Del doesn't give up easily. He's talkative, friendly and he wants to declare a truce. Neal doesn't want to be friends. But, as fate would have it, a blizzard prevents them from reaching Chicago, where they're headed, and they land up in Wichita instead. Del offers to book a room for Neal for the night. Neal doesn't have a choice, he agrees. And from there on, a series of misadventures and mishaps occur when they try to get home as soon as they can and by any means possible.Planes, Trains And Automobiles would never have worked if it wasn't for its characters. Hughes often makes the characters count in his movies, an example of which can be found in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and it's no different here. Del could be a character that could prove to be irksome if spent too much time with but here he's nothing short of charming. He's immensely affable, like his genial laugh that's disarming, and Candy plays him accordingly. In the scene where Neal ticks him off for being boring, annoying and distracting, Candy's magnificent. He radiates a feeling of hurt but emphatically states that he likes himself for being the person he is. Marvel at how expressive he is in that one scene, when his face falls, I couldn't help but applaud the skill he showed. Martin's elucidation of Neal Page is a triumph, he earns our solicitude though he's rash with Del, and never once loses the character. Both Candy and Martin sneak into the skin of their characters like water in soil and they make a hell of a team.The writing is subtle, supremely funny and often insightful. The jokes keep pelting, the one-liners are winning and the craft is exceptional. My favorite sequence in the movie is when Neal and Del steal a bus-ride and catch a young couple in the heat. The sequence is naturally evocative, prompting loud guffaws at the goofiness of the whole comical situation. The movie's loaded with sequences like this and every single one of them is rational. Somehow, that makes it funnier still.There is nothing really wrong with Planes, Trains And Automobiles except for the fact that it's very predictable and repetitive. You can guess at the very beginning how it's going to end though when Hughes actually gets there, you don't want it to. And may I add that Hughes pulls off one of the most moving endings I've witnessed in the recent spew of films.Candy and Martin are terrific in their respective roles. They end up adding the zing that the movie direly required to make a somewhat implausible plot work by playing the characters who mingle with us and stay with us long after the movie ends.Planes, Trains And Automobiles is unapologetically a wholesome crowd- pleaser that never stops being delightfully goofy and captivating. Consistently hilarious and frequently touching, it's the best film of its kind I've had the pleasure to watch.

Then what is your excuse? You owe it to yourself to let this wonderful film into your life. John Hughes pitches two of America's then biggest comedy stars together and puts them on a trip where everything that can go wrong, does! Cue chaos with the methods of transport in the title. Yet as funny as the mishaps are, and they are, with a number of events being things many of us can associate with, they would be nothing without the expert characterisations. Both as performed by a never better Martin and Candy, but also as written by Hughes.Neal Page is anal retentive, snobbish and cynicism in a suit, Del Griffith appears oafish, over talkative and comes bedecked in cheapo winter wear. As time, options and sanity start to ebb away, desperation takes a hold and a surprising co-dependency starts to form. Something that beautifully sets us up for a finale that is as touching as it is genuinely surprising. It has mature comedy characterisations for the grown ups and chaotic actions for the younger crowd.

At only 93 minutes in length, the laughs are a mile a minute at every turn.I read before that the director, John Hughes originally planned this film as a three-hour road film with even more zany antics and misadventures for Del and Neal. If that version ever comes to light (which may prove impossible now due to John Hughes untimely death in 2009), the audience is in for a very sweet treat. As for how the film turned out, it is a very energetic comedy film, while at the same time it can be a heartfelt film. You laugh, you cry, you will love Planes, Trains and Automobiles.

We begin in New York 2 days before Thanksgivings and Neal Page (Steve Martin) is desperate for his meeting to finish at work so that he doesn't miss his flight to Chicago so he can spend Thanksgivings with his family. Following a great deal of difficulty in getting a cab (there is a memorable moment where Steve Martin is racing Kevin Bacon to get to a cab) Neal eventually makes it to the Airport and is annoyed when he boards the aircraft and is told that he can't sit in the first class area as there aren't any seats (even though he has a first class ticket). He reluctantly sits in the economy section and as there are no other seats he is forced to sit next to Del Griffith (John Candy) who Neal was already angry with as he stole his taxi earlier on. The flight is then re-routed to Wichita due to bad weather in Chicago. Del then suggests that they stay in a motel for the night whilst they try to work out how they are going to get back to Chicago for Thanksgiving.Throughout the film, Del and Neal try everything they can to get back to Thanksgiving. They get a plane -that ends up being re-routed. They get a train that ends up breaking down and they hire an Automobile (hence the title Planes, Trains & Automobiles). Although they pretty much hate each other at the start of the film, they do gradually start to bond as the film progresses and end up becoming quite a team. Del even comes up with an 'ingenious' way of making money from selling shower rings - he makes people believe that they are much more valuable than they are and sells each shower ring as a 'different' valuable item to each separate customer. This scene was both clever and funny.The film works largely because of the chemistry between Candy and Martin. Their characters couldn't be more different. Del Griffith is a slob and although he is generally well intentioned is usually irritating and clumsy and he ends up pushing Neal Page to breaking point. He also talks a lot (mostly about himself) and the things that he talks about are generally monotonous and uninteresting. Steve Martin plays more of a 'straight man' role and is not a sociable person and tries not to engage Del in conversation. He also seems to have more intelligence than Del. I felt that the first half of the film was a little disappointing and whilst there were a few funny moments, I didn't really come across any 'laugh out loud' moments. Thankfully the second half of the film was much funnier (nearly every scene of Del and Neal when they were in the hire car was pure gold).Despite a pretty poor first half, PTA was a very funny film (thanks to a great second half) and is a film I will watch again next time it's on TV.

Even with great casts sometimes it never works out. Fortunately for us the chemistry is perfect and we are blessed with 90 minutes of laughs and maybe some tears. John Hughes for me is the master of showing people as they are with all their flaws and irritating qualities on show and making it very funny to watch. His direction of Planes trains and automobiles is arguably his best. The mood is just right from beginning to end, the friendship between Neal and Dell grows naturally and does not seem forced and most of all this is one of the most consistently funny films you'll ever see. I have just watched it this evening, i have seen it many times before but a long time ago and it was a surprise just how much I remembered as the film went on - I kept thinking 'oh yes this is the pillows scene' and the infamous F Bomb scene which Steve Martin delivers perfectly. Steve Martin plays almost the straight role to John Candy's lovable but irritating Dell Griffith. Steve Martin is a clever enough comedian to not try to steal scenes from John Candy by mugging or trying to be 'bigger' but to play off him. John Candys genius (and John Hughes) is to make Del the comic turn but not to stop there - to give him a serious side that develops as the movie goes on. Therefore not only do we find him funny but we begin to care for him. So then we come to the end. How many comedy's can you name that run out of steam before the end? That is another strength of Planes Trains & Automobiles - the almost sad ending when we discover that Del is a drifter really, travelling alone after the death of his wife. Neal takes him home to meet his family and the movie ends with a big smile from John Candy which freezes then fades to the credits. I've got to admit I was filling up with tears by then but I am a bit of a sap for that kind of thing. So in all this was an eighties comedy that brought together three of the big names for that period and created comedy gold that has stood the test of time. Rest in peace Mr Candy & Mr Hughes thanks for the laughs you've given me.

The man nearly defined the 80's with his films about teens and this adult comedy starring the late John Candy and the funny man Steve Martin. I don't know why I haven't seen this film until now, I never had the urge to. After seeing it now I am slapping myself on the forehead for not seeing it earlier. The comedy is great, it lies within the writing from John Hughes. Only to be brought to life perfectly and added upon by the two great leads. John Candy is both irritating and lovable. His scenes near the end are heartbreaking and his outlook on life is uplifting. Steve Martin is the everyday guy who tries to get back home to his family. Things are just not going his way. I'm sure every normal person would act the way he does in this film if these events were to happen to them. The pairing of these two comedians for this script was perfection. I've seen bits and pieces, but never sat through the entire thing. So I've seen many of the funniest parts. The funny thing is, they were still funny when watching them. The film has classic lines like Those aren't pillows and many memorable scenes, like the swearing tirade and the going the wrong way home near death experience. The film has many more, which is why it is so great to watch. This just might be my favourite John Hughes film, it's got heart, great comedic timing and is so well written that it makes my cry that he did his first draft in 3 days. As a wannabe writer, I'd kill to do that and have it be a fraction of what this is. Planes, Trains and Automobiles is a great comedy and the best Thanksgiving film.

"},{"Title":"Planes Trains and Automobiles","Date":"10 May 2010","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" John Hughes spent the 80s inventing movie formulas that we now take for granted. Like the love child of Frank Capra, Preston Sturges, Charlie Chaplin and a MTV mix-tape, Hughes created a world of angsty teens, downtrodden losers, catchy pop tunes and shamelessly sentimental button pushing. At his best, he gave us films like Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Breakfast Club and Planes Trains and Automobiles, at his worst, hokey crap like Curley Sue and Uncle Buck. By time he quit film-making in the early 90s, Hughes was already an intolerable parody of himself, knocking off his own formulas and reheating his own plots. Between 1991 and 2008 he seemed to have completely sold out, writing a string of horrendous films which, in his defence, may have turned out better had he directed them himself.Planes, Trains and Automobiles features a simple plot a company executive (Steve Martin) and a travelling salesman (John Candy) attempt to cross the country and get back to their families in time for Thanksgiving. The catch here is that Candy is an accident prone idiot who, at the end of the film, reveals himself to be homeless, alienated and without a family. In this one stroke, Hughes indicts both Martin and we the audience for being self-obsessed jerks. The message be thankful, empathetic and don't let your own unhappiness blind you to the sorrow of others. Hughes' films may be paper thin, but he has a knack for sneaking in some pretty emotional and painfully naked moments. Think that long sequence in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, in which a kid called Cameron confesses his hatred of his father, then lashes out against him by destroying the old man's car. At once intense and real, the scene seems to come out of nowhere, revealing the tragedy behind a, up until that point, lightweight pop film.Ditto the emotional meltdowns at the end of Breakfast Club, in which a group of teens stick knifes in one another's chests, or the ending of Planes Trains and Automobiles, when we're forced to re-evaluate John Candy's character, previously an object of humour and annoyance. With Hughes the message is always this is fun, until you look a bit closer. Perhaps the best example of this is Home Alone (which Hughes wrote but didn't direct), in which every kid's fantasy (being the lord of the manor) turns into a complete nightmare, a little boy realising, not only how hard it is to defend a home, but how important a family is and how lonely Christmas is without one.There's also something very modern and functional about Hughes visual style in Ferris, Breakfast and Planes. It's all simple static shots, stark compositions, lots of whites and brightly lit locations. Couple this with some nice synth music and you have a pretty cool aesthetic.8/10 &#x96; Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Breakfast Club and Planes, Trains and Automobiles are Hughes' best films, though the later is quite a few notches below the other two. The comedy is forced at times, the sentimentality cloying and the shock ending should have been set up and milked better. Mostly, though, Planes lacks the originality of the other two films, Hughes recycling elements of Jack Lemmon's The Out of Towners and The Odd Couple.Worth two viewings.

It helps that the two actors in this one do such a good job in their roles as you can feel for both of them and empathize with poor Martin's character that just wants to get home. You can also get a sense of his growing frustrations. You can also feel for Candy's character as the guy means well and is just trying to help.

I think many could make the argument that Planes, Trains & Automobiles is his best work. He wrote a lot of scripts, even into the years before his death, but as far as the ones he directed, you won't get one that resonates on an adult level quite like this. The Breakfast Club will always hold a special, nostalgic place in my heart, but, looking at his filmography, this 1987 entry is the one that doesn't deal with teenage angst. Not even speaking about the swearing&#x97;we are talking hard-R for one rental car rant alone&#x97;the subject matter is more buddy comedy dealing with serious heartache on the holidays than high school cliques and growing up. The consummate Thanksgiving film? &#x85; I'd say so. One of the best comedies ever made? &#x85; I think one could argue that statement as well.It is weird how many comedies of this kind deal with a marketing/creative executive&#x97;the underrated Nothing to Lose comes to mind&#x97;but we open with Steve Martin's Neal Page watching his boss hem and haw about an advertisement, desperately needing to catch a plane home to his family in Chicago. The film quickly becomes a race against time to make it to the airport before 600, soon finding one man as a large adversary to this goal&#x97;John Candy's great Del Griffith. This character is the epitome of what made Candy such a great comedic talent. His jolly appeal sucks you right in, making you feel for him despite his obnoxious talent at talking unceasingly. He wears his emotions on his sleeve, smiling wide when he is happy and pouting darkly when being chastised for being himself. For anyone that wonders whether they need to change who they are to keep relationships should take a good look at most of Candy's roles, but especially this one, to see that all it takes is self-confidence and a love for yourself to succeed. If someone doesn't like you for who you are, well then they aren't worthy of knowing you anyways.These two men find their lives to be intertwined for the next couple days, trying every way possible to get home. Between flight delays; inclement weather; a smoking and immobile train; a combustible rental car; awkward evenings in motel rooms; and just being two of the most opposite personalities to be put together in close quarters, the laughs are big and many. There are so many oneliners to be remembered and repeated&#x97;just ask my cousin who was quoting the film the entire day before we watched it&#x97;showing the talent that was Hughes. His ability to write how people speak was unequaled. He characters were real and very much based on people that we all have in our lives. Everyone has, or is, a stoic, serious, and cold Neal Page or an overbearing, kindhearted, loudmouth Del Griffith. No matter which they are, there is always something that makes them irreplaceable in your life; no matter their shortcomings, they are trustworthy, compassionate, and will risk their own lives for yours.Planes, Trains & Automobiles is full of set pieces and physical comedy too, but you cannot deny the writing and how it weaves all the parts to make a cohesive whole. This odd couple could make any situation gold, so pitting them against each other in heightened circumstances, let alone so many in such a short time, will allow them to excel. Tragedy upon tragedy can easily become too much, be seen as contrived plot devices that are utilized to advance the story artificially rather than a natural sequence of events. For some reason, though, and I think it goes back to Hughes, it completely works here. The transitions are seamless and instead of dreading the I wonder what will happen next question, you begin to anticipate the next unfortunate mishap, relishing the comedic genius that will follow. Both Martin and Candy are at the top of their games here, honing the elastic zaniness that made them so effective in earlier years to complement the seasoned professionalism that their careers had taken on. Martin, of course, has continued to evolve and succeed even now, more than two decades later, so we can only imagine the great unforgettable roles we've missed since Candy passed away in 1994.Again, though, no matter how important these leads are to the film, Hughes is the wizard behind the curtain. All the things he is known for, the final freeze frame, the schmaltzy music cues, (which somehow work effectively every time), and the reality of how humorous heartache can be are included. They are little trademarks, proving the auteur Hughes was, and make you wonder how different some of his scripted works would have been if he was behind the camera on them. There is also something to be said about his supporting characters&#x97;well written and integral despite the lack of screen time they are given. Someone like Kevin Bacon makes his villainous part three-dimensional while having no lines, emoting strictly from body language; Dylan Baker embodies backwoods hick like no other; and Hughes regular Edie McClurg takes the f-bomb laced rant from Martin like a champ, adding the perfect footnote to the sequence. And I think this is why his films are so cherished and unforgettable; they do all the little things right, making them masterpieces whether you feel their subject matter deserves the praise or not. They have all stood the test of time and will continue to do so for years to come, extending his legacy and securing his place in cinematic history.

In a nutshell, PT&A is a buddy comedy/road trip movie featuring a mismatched couple of guys - Neal Page (played by Steve Martin in super-manic mode)an uptight advertising executive, and Del Griffith (played by John Candy in typical lovable fashion) an infuriatingly jolly shower-curtain ring salesman. Neal wants to get home in time for Thanksgiving, but this goal is made increasingly difficult, as every mode of transport he employs is cancelled, breaks down, vanishes or is driven by a Southern inbred (yes, you read right). Things become even more sticky for Neal as he is constantly thrown together with Del whose presence threatens to drive him insane. As they careen from one situation to another, we discover that there is more to these seemingly one-dimensional characters than meets the eye. There is so much to love about this movie. The scene in the motel where Neal verbally abuses Del is funny and touching, their run-in with gurning, pick-up truck driving Owen is scarily amusing, Neal's inappropriate F-word riddled riff at the car-rental firm lady is a guilty pleasure (particularly her satisfyingly evil comeback!) while their near death experience with a clapped-out motor and two semis on the wrong side of the highway takes the cake for sheer laugh-out-loud hilarity. The only thing that chaps me about this movie is that its bleepy, electronic soundtrack sounds a little dated now, but hey, it was made in 1987 and they weren't to know it would sound a bit rubbish 20 years on.

Planes, Trains and Automobiles is a holiday film of sorts about a man whose journey across country to get home to his family becomes a wild adventure of mishaps and horrible mistakes especially when he bumps into the rather unfortunate Del Griffith. Steve Martin plays the role he's best at...the family man, who is high strung, workaholic and frustrated. It's not the first time he's done it and it certainly wasn't the last but he's enjoyable to watch doing it. He's perfect and you know exactly what to expect when Martin does a film like this. Put him together with the incomparable John Candy who is also doing his usual role as the lovable but accident prone guy. On the surface Planes, Trains, and Automobiles seems like such a typical comedy that has been made so many times but yet that doesn't make it any less enjoyable.It really is all about the star power that Candy and Martin bring to the film. They are fun to watch and they are just having a good time and the story is good enough to keep you interested. It just has something that will forever make it a classic eighties film. One of the most memorable and hilarious moments is Steve Martin's complete breakdown/rage at the car rental office to the always amusing Edie McClurg. Normally the over usage of profanity wouldn't be funny but in this case it's hilarious!! You absolutely have to see Planes, Trains and Automobiles because it's a classic of eighties cinema and features two comedy greats in their prime directed by a man who was also in his prime for film making. It's just that kind movie, light hearted, uncomplicated and feel good just because it is. 8/10 "},{"Title":"Planes, Trains and Automobiles was probably the last great ride for Hughes as a director.","Date":"26 November 2015","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Before Planes, Trains and Automobiles, director John Hughes seemed to be on his way to only making high school films. Don't get me wrong, all his high school films had style and heart but something like Breakfast Club which dealt with a lot of strong issues basically showed Hughes could also move into another genre. In the best way possible, we didn't really expect the classic road trip film like Planes, Trains and Automobiles; the first different type of film he did as a director.Two days before Thanksgiving, Neal Page (Steve Martin) and Del Griffith (John Candy) are traveling from New York to Chicago and are both trying to get home for the holiday. After their flight gets grounded by a Chicago snowstorm that strands Neal and Del in Wichita, Kansas, both go on a crazy journey to try to get home. It is a plot that would be so basic now but when this came out in 1987, it was kind of unique.As he did with his high school films, Hughes makes Planes, Trains and Automobiles stands out mostly because of characters. Neal is a pretty high level executive who is a slimeball at times but still has a heart somewhere down inside of him. Del talks too much and makes his money by selling shower rings but again like Neal he knows what's for the best. Hughes makes two great characters that can coexist and they don't override each other. Even more so, these are great performances from Martin and Candy.Nowadays, the road trip genre films struggle with plots that are just too far-fetched. Even though the plot of Planes, Trains and Automobiles might have too much of bad luck in it to be believable, you can still accept it more then most other films of this type. Planes gets grounded every year and people are stranded because we know how bad weather can be around the holidays. People do take buses like Neal and Del did for transportation at one point in the movie. John Hughes basically proves you don't have to be radical and overdo it in a road trip plot. John Hughes did so many great things in his career and Planes, Trains and Automobiles is the quintessential road trip film. Very few road films have come close to it. Even though I liked Uncle Buck which came a few years later, Planes, Trains and Automobiles was probably the last great ride for Hughes as a director.

This movie has grown on me so much over the years, that I can't remember how I felt the first time I watched it.It is perfectly cast and soundly constructed, and all else flows naturally. Steve Martin and John Candy don't play characters; they embody themselves. That's why the comedy, which begins securely planted in the twin genres of the road movie and the buddy picture, is able to reveal so much heart and truth.The movies that last, the ones we return to, don't always have lofty themes or Byzantine complexities. Sometimes they last because they are arrows straight to the heart. When Neal unleashes that tirade in the motel room and Del's face saddens, he says, Oh. I see. It is a moment that not only defines Del's life, but is a turning point in Neal's, because he also is a lonely soul, and too well organized to know it. Strange, how much poignancy creeps into this comedy, and only becomes stronger while we're laughing.

The Kevin Bacon cameo is also a classic part of this film as well. In any case, after a flight delay, they finally take off and are then bumped to Wichita, KS due to a bad snow storm in Chicago. Throughout the film, the two guys literally wind up going half across the country just to make it back to Chicago. Overall, it is a very enjoyable film that, despite its age, will remain relevant for years to come considering the fact that I'm sure other people in this world have gone through a similar situation. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone!For those who have never seen the non-TV version, though, the R rating is due to a hilarious F-bomb tirade that Steve Martin has with a Marathon Car Rental agent, played by the hilarious Edie McClurg. Neal rightfully shows his discontent after being given keys to a rental car that was not in the designated parking space. After discovering this error, however, it is too late, for the bus driver that drove him from the airport to the rental lot has already driven off. This results in Neal violently throwing his stuff down on the ground, walking and falling down a slope leading to the highway, and walking across the highway and airport runway just so he can make his way back to the rental agency.

Also, he comes across a traveling salesman that sales shower curtain rings as our two main characters are having a hard time to get along as they try to get to Chicago. It feels a bit strange on why many movies focus more on other types of holiday themes like Halloween and Christmas. I felt that there should be more moves that takes place during Thanksgiving, but try not to copy the same formula as what this movie did. Just make it as your own thing as it is done right. Planes, Trains and Automobiles will be still always be the greatest Thanksgiving movie of all time as it features a great story with great characters as well as the movie mixes its balance of humor and heart. John Hughes is such a great director for making great movies like Ferris Bueller's Day Off; Sixteen Candles; and The Breakfast Club. I also do enjoy Uncle Buck as well as the first two Home Alone movies, which he didn't direct those; but anyway, I thought he does a remarkable job on writing, producing, and directing the movie as he works well by telling a story and working with actors. Steve Martin and John Candy are both the heart and soul of the movie, and they always have a wonderful chemistry with each other. The movie is also funny, but it works so well on its levels for giving these characters some personalities. They do act like real people, which makes them colorful. I wish I can go on more about this movie, but you already know what is so great about this movie and I do agree on how great it is. The movie is indeed rated R, but the reason it receive that because of this one scene in the movie where Steve Martin's character starts loosing it as he drops some F-bombs in front of a rental agent that he is begging for a car, and expressing himself on how miserable he is. When you watch this movie, you feel like that you are actually with these guys as you are on a journey. What makes this movie very special is our main characters, which again, they are the heart and soul of the movie. I love this movie, and you will have a lot of fun by watching it.

I felt this film was safely a good one, and here below is why so.The story as stated is a little crazy and can even be said to be silly, it goes well though, I personally enjoyed the chemistry between the two given the situation and the ending of the film is pretty sweet indeed. It goes a nice pace because the film is not a long one and this makes it even better, never afraid to rush scenes and the dialogue and things going are not done lazily at all, just some good work put in here.Steve Martin is not in his main funny role but he likes his angry main character role, and that's what he provides, funny anger. John Candy is the real funny man of the film and we feel sorry for him on more than one occasion, he just exudes laughs and warmth and even though annoying, still a good guy in the end. I loved the chemistry between the two, they work so well together and more collaborations would have be welcome, if it were not for Candy's untimely death(in real life).John Hughes directs and writes this just as a comedy and possibly drama genre should be, his skill in the screenplay is plainly seen as I said about the un lazy scenes of the film, hard work put in for sure. It of course with the commotion provides some wonderful back drops really crediting the USA's countryside, an easy view to the eye, well usually when the two are in happier times and places.The film Is not without criticism, I found that the story although yes is fun, it is also predictable and watching it for the first time you just knew what was coming next. It isn't also super funny, the sweetness of the story is what also helps this but the comedy can really lack at some points. I will say on that point, Candy saves the day a few times, and coaxes Martin in to being a funny guy.If you like this kind of lazy afternoon comedy fun time then this is for you, it really is a film that is to be watched when one is happy. For those who are fans of either Candy or Martin, you should love this, it seems to bring near the best out of them and when they work together in certain scenes here, it brings a wealth of expertise. For those who love these funny 80's comedies that came out quite a bit, then this is also for you, has all the elements that various films of the decade also had and even more new things too, just good fun, and for all the family(just about).Overall it is Safely a Good movie. As I said before watching on a lazy day and chilled, this can be a wonderful film, I do feel parts were never crying out with laughter but it does provide chuckles in various places. Just adore the chemistry of two of the 80's best when it comes to this kind of comedy, it doesn't rely on physical comedy as well and I have to say I have a lot of respect for the film because of that, just enjoy it.

Neal Page (Steve Martin) is trying to get home to Chicago for Thanksgiving from New York City on business. And everything that could possibly go wrong, goes absolutely wrong. Del Griffith (John Candy) accidentally starts these chain of events by taking Neal's cab. Steve Martin plays a perfect, slightly cynical, cold-hearted man who loves his family. Candy is amazing as an over-bearing but nice man who has a past that nobody really knows about. The plot set-up sounds fairly typical, Del Griffith and Neal end up traveling together throughout the film as things continue to get worse and worse. It isn't an original plot-set up by any means but it's the execution and the heart of the film that makes it work so well. The scenes are continuously outrageous, over the top, and only emphasized by Candy's performance who is absolutely ridiculous but a completely heartfelt character. Everything is 100% genuine in this movie. Sure, it could be called a bit overly sentimental by the end of the film but sometimes sentimentality&#x85;works. Trust me, I hate when things get overly sentimental, it's cheesy and typically bad but this movie does it so right. As each outrageous scene builds upon each other, we believe it, and then at the end, I still buy into the gooey, heartfelt center of the movie in those last somewhat revealing twenty minutes even if it's somewhat obvious as to how it'll probably end when watching it. It's hilarious, plain and simple. I found myself laughing pretty much right from the start and continuously laughing throughout. My particular favorite scene is Steven Martin completely losing it at the car rental lady (Edie McClurg) which I actually bothered to mention the actress's name because she was also in Ferris Bueller as a secretary and is a great character actress. As soon as I saw her on screen, I knew it was going to be a great scene. If anything, it's hilarious, if the overly sentimental stuff doesn't work for you, it might not matter just because it's filled with plenty of laughs. For me, it's a perfect film/comedy.

Anyone who's seen a bunch of road trip movies in their lifetime won't find much here that's surprising per se. However, the execution of this particular road trip movie is worthy of appreciation from fans of such a genre. Of course, I'm not just saying this because there are two worthy comedic leads to pull it off, but there is also quality storytelling and jokes in this film as well. Steve Martin plays an everyday businessman on a business trip in New York who's trying to get home to Chicago and return to his wife and kids in time for Thanksgiving. However, a traveling salesman (John Candy) constantly keeps getting in his way through an assortment of difficult, unfortunate circumstances that keep occurring unexpectedly. Whether it's through accidentally stolen cabs, flights being cancelled due to the weather, or anything of that sort, he somehow keeps getting screwed in funny and spectacular ways. On top of that, he always seems to end up sticking with this guy on his longer-than-usual trip to Chicago. Basically, this businessman is undergoing the commute from hell. What should have been a simple two hour flight becomes an unimaginably complicated three day extravaganza. It's not like the guy he's accompanied by is mean or anything. In fact, he seems to be a pretty nice guy, but this businessman just has no patience talking with him, especially in a time like this when all he wants to do is get home safely. But as the traveling nonsense keeps continuing, these two start to learn more about and eventually respect each other and who they are as people. What makes Planes, Trains & Automobiles stand out from all the other road trip comedies out there is its execution. In other words, the best way to sum up this appropriately named comedy is that it's everything that could possibly go wrong with traveling of any kind during the holidays, particularly Thanksgiving. The inconvenient situations that make this businessman's trip back home get progressively worse and worse all have phenomenal comedic timing. The way this story progresses is also great since we can identify with the unbearable circumstances this guy is going through, especially if we've had traveling troubles before in our lives. I know I had an unfortunate flying experience not too long ago, my first time flying alone as a matter of fact, where I arrived to my destination five hours late. Anyone who has been through situations like the one I've experienced recently will appreciate this film's storytelling since it acknowledges how tough traveling has sadly become. Having said all that, while I do acknowledge that this is a well-crafted film, I wouldn't say that it's a great film yet. Even though I did laugh plenty of times, I guess I just expected to have a couple more laughs than what I actually got. Additionally, although Martin and Candy are good in their roles, their relationship is pretty easy to predict where it'll go, which in turn sort of prevents the chemistry from being natural. Overall, Planes, Trains & Automobiles is a lot like The Odd Couple (1968) in that it's a buddy comedy that is good, ideal evening entertainment and nothing more.

Dale Griffith (John Candy) is a big, fat, goofy and jolly shower-ring salesman, embracing life and human relationships with gentleness and empathy. Both men must fly to Chicago for Thanksgiving, and it seems like Providence holds a constant grudge against them, from a banal New York's traffic jam to an unfortunate blizzard that would cancel out all the flights, they never get their break ... for our greatest delight, I must say.John Hughes' Planes, Trains and Automobiles sets the tone in the first twenty minutes, featuring all the standards of the comedic road movie where good old Murphy's law is never contradicted, and the manly buddy-movie where two opposite meet and the most efficient gags result from the frictions between the clumsy August and the straight white-faced clown. On that level, Steve Martin is delightfully sinister while John Candy hides behind his cheerful nature, an oasis of sweet gentleness. Both actors are perfectly casted, but it's naturally John Candy who steals the show as the heart of the film, the driver of the whole story, almost literally.I guess I could also summarize the film by describing it as a perfect combo of two Jack Lemmon's classics Gene Saks' Odd Couple and Arthur Hiller's Out-of-Towners where Lemmon and his wife played by Sandy Dennis endure similar transportations' inconveniences. As for the Odd Couple, the comparison works because there is something in both Martin and Candy that reminds of the Lemmon-Matthau partnership, something exuding manliness with a subtle softer side. And that's the secret of Planes, Trains and Automobiles' appeal, it's a comedy with a heart, such, a big heart, that it floats above all the stereotypes of its genre and elevate itself to another dimension, something I can't really describe except by saying it will be forever incarnated by John Candy's expressions in two particular scenes.The first one happens in the middle of the night, in a sleazy motel of Wichita where expectedly the two manly men end up sharing one bed, Neil's spot being wet by Dale's beer. But one's patience is limited and when tired of all the troubles that filled his night, climaxing with Dale's snoring, Neil finally vents his anger, in these outbursts of rage where the flow of words is uncontrollable. Neil's speech comforts Martin's position as a comical character he suggests Dale to always have a punch line to his anecdotes, and says he can endure any seminar because he would've been trained by Dale. Suddenly, there's a sad shot on Dale's hurt face Neil had touched a sensitive nerve. Dale knows he's too gentle, too empathic, but that's the way he is, and at least, the ice is broken, and the relationship between the two men can take a much better departure.The second face is the last one, when after a series of misadventures, Neil finally realizes that Dale is a lonely man, and invites him to spend Thanksgiving in his house. John Candy is probably one of the sweetest actors who ever enchanted the screen, at a time where laughs didn't have to be cynical and mean-spirited. And it's precisely what Dale is a man proud of his gentleness, which is both poignant and inspiring. The last shot of Planes, Trains and Automobiles immortalizes everything that ever incarnated the legendary John Candy, and it's even sadder looking at that scene thinking that the actor prematurely left us in 1994. John Hugues', who also passed away a few years ago, started the film as a comedy, but as if he perceived the emotional value of the story, he didn't let the laughs inundate the film and concluded it with the right tone. And it's for the two moments I described, that the film is more than a comedy.But let's not get too sentimental, the movie also contains many comedic gold moments, an obligatory shot of the two men embracing in bed, until Martin realizes that the place where Candy put his hand aren't pillows, the debate is open whether it's this particular line or the following discussion that is the funnier. There is also a very sweet bus trip where Martin gets a big flop by singing &#x85; what did he sing again? Never mind, the priceless look of the passengers says it all, thankfully Dale saves the day by the perfect song's choice Meet the Flintstones!, Candy is indeed a great Fred-Flintstonesque figure, as a man who'd know how to appeal to both kids and adults (seriously who can resist to this chubby face, with the elbow and cute mustache). And Planes, Trains and Automobiles never stops being funny, even when not hilarious, it's humorously touching, even when Martin is left alone, we get the unforgettable rant to the pudgy rental service agent, a gutsy moment of screen writing where the film forgets about all the cutesy stuff, and let a ton of F-bombs drop in our faces, the last one being the icing of the cake. Naturally, Martin and Candy meet again for the last memorable trip of the film, and an unforgettable climax where both find themselves driving in the wrong way. Again, the situation is funny, but it's all about the way it's shown from their reactions and perceptions. No matter how cute is Candy, at that moment, in Neil's eyes, he was quite believable as Satan.All the parts aren't equally funny, many became archetypal considering the appeal of the two comedic sub-genres, but the magic of the film is to grow slowly in your heart, to have an ability to surprise you, to always be printed in your memories right after watching it, and that's an accomplishment even 'better' movies failed to achieve. One thing for sure, that's a trip you won't forget, and its conclusion is simply beautiful.

This is not a barrel of laughs, but it is enjoyable because the humor evolves from the situations that arise rather than being forced. Martin and Candy are perfectly cast and work well with each other as the odd couple. Rather than letting the characters turn into caricatures for the sake of laughs, Hughes fleshes them out and makes them sympathetic. The funniest bit has Martin profanely venting at a rental car clerk, a scene that is solely responsible for the film's R rating. Sadly, both Candy and writer-director were gone too soon.

One man's thwarted (and then some!) efforts to do just that, going from New York to Chicago, pretty much sums up the plot of this entertaining and amusing John Hughes hit movie of the late 80's.It helps of course that Steve Martin and the late John Candy are so good and more importantly so good together in the main parts, Martin the cussed city-man, sharp-suited and well-off, Candy the well-meaning but accident-prone oddball slob. Their successive air, rail and road trips, plus their stay-over at the worst hotel this side of Fawlty Towers are laced with humorous episodes, before it straightens up and flies right to its anticipated, all- inclusive happy-ending.Funniest bits for me were Martin's post-shower towel options, the two of them frozen, sitting on the truck and of course the bed scene and in particular the realisation of where Candy's hand has been resting.It's all funny, knockabout stuff, with both stars on fine form, Martin not quite able to give up on his basic human decency despite the strongest provocation and Candy irrepressible in his desire to please and buddy-up with his fellow-traveller.While the holiday celebrated here itself may be exclusively American, the humour is universal and at times, perhaps deliberately, evoked the great Laurel and Hardy team of yesteryear, praise indeed.

He is basically responsible for almost every great movie of the 1980s. Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Pretty in Pink, The Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles are just a few of his masterpieces. Hughes made many great teenage films through his career, but my favorite of his is the buddy travel comedy Planes, Trains & Automobiles. Everything about this movie works and works better then in any comedy I have ever seen. Planes, Trains & Automobiles is Hughes' best film and a Thanksgiving tradition. The story is now a cliché, but only because of this movie. Neil Page, a white collar yuppie, must struggle to travel home for Thanksgiving with Del Griffith, an obnoxious slob of a shower ring salesman his only companion. The idea of this story has so many possibilities, which is why it has been so often imitated. The most recent example I can think of is Due Date, which basically proves that the idea doesn't work well outside of Planes, Trains & Automobiles. There are so many good things in this movie that it would take forever to write down every one. Steve Martin and John Candy have great chemistry. You could actually believe that they were not acting and were actually people who just met for the first time and don't really enjoy each others company. The movie is also very heartfelt. You could almost call Planes, Trains & Automobiles a dramady for how many struggles there are. Throughout the movie there is something happening to Del's wife and the pay off is very good that even you can't help but be moved by a movie where Steve Martin washes his face with John Candy's underwear. But the number one thing about Planes, Trains & Automobiles that makes it one of my favorite films of all time is the comedy. Planes, Trains & Automobiles has to be the funniest movie I have ever seen, followed by Anchorman, Hangover, and Caddyshack. Every few seconds another joke pops up that just brings me to tears. The airplane scene, the hotel room scene, the car rental scene, the wrong way up the freeway scene, almost every joke in this movie make me laugh every time I watch it. I cannot imagine a movie even close to being as funny as this one. Though being the film critic I am, I am forced to nitpick to find a problem with this movie. There is only one thing that kind of irked me. Three or four times the movie cuts to Neil's wife alone in bed, waiting for him. Once or twice it is nice to watch, but as it goes on it tend to make you roll your eyes.Other then that, I cannot think of a single thing wrong. Planes, Trains & Automobiles is one of my favorite movies of the 1980s, only behind Back to the Future and Raiders of the Lost Ark. The movie plays to almost every emotion you have that you love to watch it to see what happens to these characters. The movie is a Thanksgiving tradition around my house and I hope it becomes one of yours. Planes, Trains & Automobiles is not only my favorite comedy, but also my sixteenth favorite movie of all time "},{"Title":"Casey's Movie Mania PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES (1987)","Date":"24 November 2012","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" No holiday movies would ever be complete without a special mention to John Hughes' buddy-comedy classic, PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES. Prior to this movie, Hughes is best known for his defining teen genre in the '80s by the likes of SIXTEEN CANDLES, THE BREAKFAST CLUB and FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF. PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES marked his first foray into adult comedy. A radical departure, indeed but Hughes manages to hit (almost) all the right buttons here.The story goes like this Ad marketing executive Neal Page (Steve Martin) is trying to beat the New York rush-hour traffic in hope to get home in time for Thanksgiving with his family at Chicago. But he's already stuck with the first mishap when he fails to get a cab ride after a despicable stranger (a young Kevin Bacon, in a cameo) beats him first in a race to get the vacant cab found in the midst of the heavy traffic. Neal's bad luck just keeps on coming when he fails to get the next cab after a fat guy snatched the ride that Neal had bought from an attorney just before.Despite that, Neal manages to arrive at the airport just in time to catch the plane, only to find that his flight has been delayed. From there, he stumbles upon the same fat guy again, whose name is Del Griffith (John Candy), a shower-curtain ring salesman. Hours later, Neal manages to board the plane and coincidentally ends up sitting next to Del again. Things goes from bad to worse when the flight forced to detour to Wichita, Kansas due to severe snowstorm. This is where Neal's worst nightmare trip of his life begins with Del no matter where he goes.Such concept is a novel idea, and Hughes is certainly have a blast making fun of the horrors of transportation in America (which is actually based on his own personal experience). The movie is benefited from many well-timed hilarious scenes (two memorable highlights -- Neal's dissatisfaction with a car rental agent, played by Edie McClurg, after he finds his rental car is not designated in the expected spot -- You can start by wiping that f**king dumbass smile off your rosy f**king cheeks. Then you can give me a f**king automobile. A f**king Datsun, a f**king Toyota, a f**king Mustang, a f**king Buick &#x97; 4 f**king wheels and a seat!. The other one involves Del doesn't realize he's actually driving at the wrong side of the highway). Hughes' direction is mostly impeccable, that blends well with character-driven drama and outrageous comedy. Then, somewhere towards the restrained finale, he manages to slip in a last-minute touching twist without being out of the place.Both Steve Martin and John Candy made a terrific pair together. They are funny all right, but what makes them really involving is the way they develop their caricatures-free characters into fully-formed individuals we can identify for. Martin is perfectly cast as a straight man with an uptight attitude, while Candy excels with one of the best performances in his short-lived career as the talkative and slobbish fat guy. He may look like an annoying idiot in the exterior, but deep down, his carefree personality hides a deep loneliness. In one scene, Neal confesses that he's sick of listening to his unfunny stories and there we can see Del is hurt by his ugly remark.Although there are times Hughes gets overwhelmed with an excessive collection of pop songs cramming throughout the movie, it's a minor quibble anyway. Other than that, PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES is one of Hughes' finest works to date and certainly a must-see for every comedy fans.http//caseymoviemania.blogspot.com "},{"Title":"Funny, Funny.

This comic duo plays traveling businessmen who accidentally bump into each other during a crazy trip home for the holidays. Steve Martin plays Neal Page - a smug, successful businessman with a wife and three kids who he leaves alone most of the time in their big, suburban house in Chicago while he works too much on the road. John Candy plays Del Griffith, a shower curtain ring salesman who plays the clown on the outside but we know that inside, he is in some kind of pain. He talks too much, is sloppy and carries this giant trunk everywhere he goes; but there is something warm and kind about him; even though he is obnoxious, we cannot help but like him. The two are an unlikely pair; but their paths cross over and over again when Neal Page is trying to get home to his family for Thanksgiving. And just like the characters in this movie, we are in for the ride of our lives!As you might guess, everything goes wrong for these two. From Del stealing a cab from Neal - and then Neal being bumped from first class on the plane only to be seated next to blabbermouth Del - to further flight delays, and unsuccessful car rentals - this Laurel and Hardy pair eventually end up on the road together and ultimately in the same hotel room...and the same bed. This hotel scene is absolutely sidesplitting. In another classic scene in which Neal (Martin) tries to get a rental car at the airport, he is so tired and angry, he totally abuses the woman at the car-rental counter. In this scene, the word f***ing is uttered more times than you can count and it is so hilarious - your ribs will hurt from laughing.This movie has some of the funniest scenes in comedy history and if you don't laugh until you cry, there is something seriously wonky with your sense of humor. You're going the wrong way! is a line that will forever be associated with this film and if you have not ever seen it, please, please put it on your list.In the midst of the flawlessly funny exchanges between Martin and Candy, there are some very touching moments in this film that remind us what the holidays are all about family and friendship; peace, love and goodwill toward others. This movie manages to get that message across loud and clear even though you are laughing your ass off through most of it.Boy, do I miss John Candy so much.

To start, we have the late and great John Hughes directing and writing this hilarious film. Then there are the two stars of the film which have more than staked their claim as comedy legends. Steve Martin and John Candy, another late legend, couldn't have been more perfect here. Planes, Trains, & Automobiles is a wild and wacky story about a man who is just trying to get home for the holidays. Steve Martin plays Neal Page, and uptight businessman who desperately needs to make it home in time for Thanksgiving dinner. He has his first run in with John Candy's character, Del Griffith, when Del steals his cab. But then, through extreme coincidence, he ends up sitting next to Del on the flight back to Chicago. Del is a talkative, loudmouthed, shower ring curtain salesman who Neal initially wishes had never stumbled into his life. When the plane has to make an emergency landing because of the snow, Neal reluctantly teams up with Del to find a way back to Chicago. Hilarity and wackiness ensue in this uproariously fantastic comedy.This is the kind of movie that if you hate it in any way you must not be human. I mean, what's not to like about this charming, hilarious, and even heartfelt film. It's not a gross out comedy, it's not overly vulgar, and it's not the kind of film that is only about the jokes, leaving the story to rot. It's a comedy for everyone. It's an honest, funny, and heartwarming film about friendship in the most unorthodox of places. It's a situational comedy that never gets dull and every scene strives to be more absurd and ridiculous as the previous. The plot never falls apart and the characters only become more lovable as the film progresses.Of course, they're only lovable because of the great actors portraying them. Steve Martin and John Candy have unexpectedly brilliant chemistry on screen. Steve Martin fits so perfectly into the straight man role, even though we are so used to him being an over-the-top goofball. But he hones the other side of the comedy spectrum so well and it fits perfectly with John Candy's character. Candy plays his character at such a perfect level. He is over-the-top, but not to the point where he is a gimmick, rather than a character. We see this role in comedy duo films all the time now, but the role John Candy plays in Planes, Trains, & Automobiles is always played up way too much and everything they do is just for a laugh, not to develop a character. Candy's portrayal of Del Griffith is just weird enough to make his a very bizarre character, but not ridiculous enough to keep him from being incredibly lovable.However, I'm always struck with a tinge of sadness when I grow to love a John Candy character because his absence from the comedy world is painfully depressing. The world lost a genius in 1994 and it's incredibly sad to think where his career could have gone if he hadn't been taken from us. However, there is a lot of rejoice and consolation in the fact that we can preserve Candy's memory through great films like Planes, Trains, & Automobiles.

Neal partners up with obnoxiously crude and hearty, but honest and lovable traveling salesman Del Griffith (a fine and endearing performance by John Candy) on a disaster-prone cross country trek from New York to Chicago. Writer/director John Hughes wisely avoids presenting the two main characters as cardboard one-note characters; instead they are complex, flawed,, totally believable, and hence quite likable human beings. Martin and Candy play off each other beautifully well, with Candy in particular a stand-out in a meaty part that gives him a rare chance to put his excellent and underrated dramatic skills to genuinely poignant and impressive use (his I like me speech is a lovely and moving little gem). Laila Robbins projects a sweet glow as Neal's wife Susan. Moreover, a bunch of familiar faces pop up in nifty minor parts Kevin Bacon (he races Neal for a cab), an uncredited Lyman Ward, Ben Stein, Dylan Baker (nicely boorish as scruffy redneck Owen), Eddie McClurg (a hoot as an annoyingly chipper car rental agent Neal unloads an expletive-ridden rant on), Michael McKeon, Charles Tyner, and William Windom as Neal's fussy and indecisive boss (the last shot of this guy checking out three different prototypes for a print ad is absolutely priceless!). Better still, there's a real big, warm, and generous heart to go along with the sharp and amusing humor. This film isn't only funny, but also surprisingly affecting as well.

It is clear that Neal finds Del very irritating and, when they are diverted to Wichita; his mood doesn't improve when they're forced to share a hotel room. They next try the train, but that breaks down and they're forced to get the bus to St Louis. I won't tell you the whole of their trip, but needless to say this odd couple's adventures are just beginning.This is a really well made film with, just about, the best actors possible chosen for the starring roles. I cannot imagine this film being made with anyone else playing those parts (probably why I won't watch 'Due Date' (2010)). Steve Martin plays the uptight Neal Page so well and John Candy is at his brilliant best as the really annoying Del Griffith. Oh, and look out for a non speaking role for Kevin Bacon, racing Steve Martin for a cab at the beginning of the film.As I may have already intimated, I think the casting for this one is perfect. Add to that a superb script by John Hughes and you have a classic American comedy.

Despite his many and obvious vices he's extremely good at selling. Steve Martin plays a more conventional business type, both are seeking to get home for thanksgiving.The weather and a host of other complications threaten their plans and pitch them both unwillingly together.It's a road movie. And it's a buddy movie. And it's a journey of discovery movie. The plot is as predictable as you might expect, as indeed are most of the gags. But John Candy is such a likable character with a great turn in comic timing and a very expressive face, that he can pitch even a bum role into something special. He has that same magic of Danny DeVito.Steve Martin is - I believe - less funny, and he gets a less funny role, playing - or attempting to play - a straight foil for Candy's chaotic excess. In this regard, they are well suited, and the movie blunders along from disaster to disaster. It's not exactly laugh-out-loud, but it has a very high grin factor. I particularly enjoyed the burning car sequence, where we can see that it's rapidly going up in flames, because of the brightening glow on their backs, whilst they are unaware of it all.Towards the end we learn than Candy's character actually has no real home to go back to, and Martin's character, by now on buddy terms, invites him to join his family Thanksgiving instead. The movie ends there, but the viewer is left to suspect that this walking disaster will probably set fire to the house.Recommended if you're down in the dumps.

Which is fine, sometimes a movie doesn't have to have any huge conspiracy, it doesn't need to be a complete mystery or have any huge impact, this movie is in my opinion a masterpiece and the story as simple as it is does what it needs to do, perfect for its decade.Actors 10/10 Back in the days Steve Martin was huge, today he is more settled down but back then he was the beef, he was and is a great actor so how could you ever go wrong with the way he act, and of course let us not forget the other companion because let us be honest if it had been any other then John Candy the movie wouldn't have had as much glow as it does, John Candy was one of the greatest actors of his time, you don't see many movies that went wrong when he was in the lead, he was the beef until his death in 1994, he will always be remembered for spot on acting, R.I.P homes. Together these two make the perfect couple in a movie, you want to like them both, and you want to find out what happens, in the beginning the movie does act slow but as it continues you will be sitting in front of your screen watching until the end.Soundtrack 10/10 Oh Come on let us be clear here, the music is spot on, there are some nice tracks on this, many of them you will like, actually just about all of them, my only beef with the soundtrack is that the ending song Every time You Go Away would have been better to be placed as the last song in the whole movie, I mean it is perfect fitted but I would have been more glad if it ended on that song as well. The Music is spot on, it is your cheesy music from the 80s, you all know this stuff, but everything is perfect in the sense, the music moves the movie even a lot more than it had to.Overall 9/10 The movie is almost perfect, yeah I said it, but I know that many like this movie so I am not going to be thrown down in the mud anyway, John Hughes wanted to show that he could break through the teenage flick barrier even as perfect as they all were, he did this they way you really wanted him to do it, the movie is simple and honest, it doesn't hide much and doesn't change much but for what it Is the movie is spot on, R.I.P John R.I.P knowing you create a true legacy!

It starts out a mild Comedy, then works into a pure Drama. Both Steve Martin and John Candy were at the height of their career when this movie rolled into cinemas in 1987. From the works of late and great John Hughes, is Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.Neal Page (Steve Martin) is an advertising executive who is short tempered while trying to get home to his family for the Thanksgiving holiday. After screaming at Del Griffith (John Candy) for stealing his cab, little does Page know he will soon run into the lovable lummox again.On a plane to Chicago, Neal realizes that he cant escape Del after finding he has a seat with him on the plane ride to Chicago. Unluckily the flight is incapable of going to Chicago because of a big storm, and re routes them to Kansas. The duo must learn to cope with each others tensions and some annoying aspects in order to get back to Chicago.But of course, obstacles and roadblocks come frequent on their way home. When the wallet is lost, the car catches fire, and other laughable tactics they believe all hope for them is lost. Though there is always a light at the end of the tunnel in this film.When John Hughes past away, this was one of the films I thought of instantly before National Lampoon's Vacation and The Breakfast Club. Its a great movie about the brotherly bonding of two strangers.

Regardless of some stupid humor, its a great John Hughes film that beats Dutch and National Lampoon's European Vacation by a long shot. Steve Martin and John Candy were the perfect duo of the 80s, and definitely a film on one of the greatest films of all time.

I watched it for the first time during the first half of 2006. By then, I had seen Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Hughes' teen comedy released the year before this adult one, which I thought was funny, and knowing Planes, Trains & Automobiles was also a widely appealing comedy, I was expecting it to be funny as well. As a result, it was far from disappointing to me, as I found it hilarious for the most part! It took me 3 ½ years to get around to watching it again, but a second viewing definitely didn't change my opinion.Neal Page is an uptight advertising executive who is on a business trip in New York and really wants to get home to his family in Chicago for Thanksgiving. First, he hails a cab for a ride to the airport, but the ride is taken by another passenger. At the airport, he meets the guy who took his ride, who turns out to be a motor mouth. On the plane, the ad exec meets this guy for the third time, having to sit beside him! The motor mouth introduces himself as Del Griffith, a shower curtain ring salesman, and continues to get on Neal's nerves. Unfortunately, Neal's bad luck isn't about to end. Due to inclement weather in Chicago, the plane lands in Wichita, Kansas instead, and the two of them find themselves stuck there for the night! From here, Neal's frustrating journey continues, as he faces a number of mishaps, often because of Del's clumsiness, and is unable to ever get away from the shower curtain ring salesman for very long as they are both forced to try more than one mode of transport! The lead roles in this energetic comedy are played by Steve Martin and John Candy, and these two comedians really carry the film. Candy really stands out in the role of a loud and clumsy but well-meaning and lovable character. He is deservedly remembered as a great comedian, and his role here is one he has been widely remembered for since his premature death over fifteen years ago. Martin also contributes a lot to the humour in this movie, with his irritated faces and freak-outs. Planes, Trains & Automobiles is made continuously funny (very often hilarious) with Neal's constant bad luck, Del getting on Neal's nerves with his chattering and clumsiness, some slapstick mishaps, etc. Also, it isn't ALL about the laughs, as there is also character depth, and it sometimes gets poignant, especially during the last bit of the film. These things added to all the hilarious gags make a great combination, and a great film! John Candy passed away in 1994 at the age of 43, and John Hughes, who wrote, directed, and produced this movie, left us a little over three months ago at 59, the age Candy would have turned last month. Both deaths were caused by heart attacks. Even though I was about 7 ½ years old when Candy died, and I never heard of him until later in the 90's, to me it seems kind of strange that he's been gone that long. With Planes, Trains & Automobiles, both Hughes and Candy really showed their talent, and may they both R.I.P. Steve Martin obviously deserves credit for his performance in this hit 80's comedy as well, and so do some of the cast members who played smaller roles. If this wacky comedy and partial drama isn't quite perfect, it does come close, and for me, watching it twice made it clear that it's not one of those films that are just good for one viewing!

Teen Angst) is John Hughes' Legacy With His Road Classic","Date":"9 August 2009","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" The untimely death of filmmaker John Hughes this past Thursday, August 6, 2009, gave many writers and bloggers an opportunity to commemorate his memorable 1980's Brat Pack comedies like Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club. He captured teen angst in a way that set him apart from any of his exploitation-driven colleagues. However, for my money, his best and funniest work is actually a road movie, 1987's Planes, Trains and Automobiles. Film critic Roger Ebert goes as far as including it as one of his top favorites in his 2005 compendium, The Great Movies II. For me, I continue to be surprised at how much I laugh when I see this movie.I thought that by now, surely the comic sight gags and the casting of Steve Martin and the late John Candy would automatically make this a candidate for an eighties time capsule. Instead, I have to agree with Ebert and say this film has only grown over time. The laughs are still there, but so is a somewhat more dramatic undercurrent that I likely ignored the first time I saw it. What it comes down to is a classic anti-buddy picture as two mismatched individuals are thrown together and of course, suffer one bizarre misadventure after another as they try to make it home to Chicago for Thanksgiving.Although one would think it would have more in common with Neil Simon's The Odd Couple, the plot actually reminds me much more of Simon's The Out-of-Towners, and anyone familiar with that film will have a good idea of what will happen to them. They spend a night in a cramped hotel room sleeping in the same bed, endure customer-indifferent rental car clerks, suffer through a series of vehicle breakdowns, and watch one of their last hopes literally go up in smoke. As persnickety salesman Neal Page, Martin seems to be on a constant simmer just ready to boil at the most inopportune times. Candy plays the obnoxious Del Griffith, a shower curtain-ring salesman armed with an endless supply of dumb jokes and pointless anecdotes.That both men manage to make their respective characters likable is a testament to their appeal as comic actors. Martin is able to elicit empathy for a man uncomfortable with unpredictable circumstances. Candy goes beyond the obvious buffoon to reveal a vulnerable, lonely man made even more so by the holiday season. There is a particularly touching moment when he silently expresses his character's swelling hurt as Neal berates him for his unfunny stories. Nevertheless, it's really the comedy scenes that make this movie truly memorable, the best one involving Del's lip-synching of Ray Charles' The Mess Around behind the wheel of a car he is driving in the wrong direction. Classic Hughes, well missed.

In this movie, he actually makes you laugh as a jerk character. Also John Candy is a great chatter mouth. John Hughes is the best director of the 80's and this is one of his best films. The movie has music going through the whole film that put a date stamp that says it's taking place in the 80's, but that's part of the reason why it's so delightful.Steve Martin is just trying to get home when he runs into John Candy over and over again until he must travel with him, even though he can't stand him. The lack of chemistry is used successfully at the end of the movie and as if they were actually strangers by the end of the movie you feel that they have bonded. They are both extremely talented.It is primarily a goofy comedy but towards the end it will prove to have a lot of heart and you have sympathy for the main characters.

Although I'm sorry to say that I'm never going to consider it one of my favorites--John Candy is so annoying that he's hardly bearable, even though that's really the point and he comprises a great deal of the comedy, and I just have this thing about journey films; I dunno, that standard plot just doesn't grab me, from The Odyssey to this, I know it's weird--I was laughing hysterically the entire way through.The laughs are just as frequent and strong as the best of sketch comedy.

Most of the time when I watch a comedy it's a chuckle here and there, and maybe one or two good laughs. Often I don't find a (supposed) comedy funny at all. Even most good comedies are funny in parts and fade off noticeably (especially after the first half).So for me it's saying something when I tell you I can watch this time and again and bust up constantly nearly all the way through the film. I can't think of a film that I've found funnier. Martin and Candy are absolutely hilarious as the mismatched buddies trying to make it home for Thanksgiving.Both Martin and Candy play their parts to absolute perfection. What you have here is a genuinely funny script made twice as funny by two very very good comedians at the absolute top of their game. The facial expressions alone are good for scores of laughs throughout the film.Add to this that the film blends in a poignant and touching storyline that may take you by surprise and you have a truly rare film. It will make you laugh and it will make you cry. The screenplay works beautifully.As a final note, I couldn't quite give the film a 10, merely because I am a bit disappointed in the language in the film. Although played for comedic effect, it would have been nice to have the movie a bit cleaner. However, that's the only thing negative I have to say about it.

Looking back on it, it had to be deleted. Straight away. It was five lines long, so hopefully this one will be better.I have to admit, this movie is better on a second watching. I can't remember really enjoying it the first time round as I did this time. I found myself giggling a lot more, but also, maybe I was feeling really emotional that night watching this, but I also ended up crying at a couple of points. It's actually, beneath all the funny moments, a really sad movie. The scene in the motel bedroom where Steve Martin's character points out all John Candy's bad points is utterly convincing, and that's the point I did start crying. John acted it really well, with his bottom lip quivering. But his comeback just makes it all the worse You wanna hurt me? Go right ahead if it makes you feel any better. I'm an easy target. Yeah, you're right, I talk too much. I also listen too much. I could be a cold-hearted cynic like you... but I don't like to hurt people's feelings. Well, you think what you want about me; I'm not changing. I like... I like me. My wife likes me. My customers like me. 'Cause I'm the real article. What you see is what you get. The other scene I started crying at, was when Del couldn't get a room at the motel, cos he only had $2, and a Casio watch, and he had to sit in the burnt out car. Talking to his wife who wasn't there. Yes I did cry again. It's such a sad movie.But it's also hilarious. It's definitely one of Steve Martin's best movies, and he agrees it's his favourite movie of his own. He comes out with some absolute classic lines in this, but I'm not going to repeat them all here. If you've seen the movie, you know what they are. Roll on Christmas is all I can say after watching this movie, and now I want to start wrapping presents.

There I was, watching this wonderfully funny comedy when it occurred to me that this film wasn't there. Springing into action like a cobra with ADHD, I immediately sought to rectify this situation in the only way I know how. By telling you how great this film is, you have no excuse not to watch it and vote with your mouse-fingers. The campaign starts now! In case this has somehow passed you by, Steve Martin (in possibly the best performance of his career) plays straight-laced business guy Neal Page who is desperate to fly outta New York back to Chicago to be with his family at Thanksgiving. After missing his original flight, he finds himself stranded at the airport with a loud, uncouth shower-curtain ring salesman named Del Griffith (John Candy). And that's just the start of his problems as his next flight is diverted to Wichita and he just can't seem to shake his annoying best buddy...In truth, this is less about the journey and more about Martin and Candy who seem to have the time of their lives tearing into each other as the mismatched couple struggling to get home. In fact, that's just one aspect of Planes, Trains & Automobiles that makes this such a brilliantly written and performed comedy. Martin and Candy are on top form here, trading biting one-liners with classic old-skool slapstick. But what lifts this movie for me are the unbelievably emotive scenes that really do stick a lump in your throat. Both actors are just superb from start to finish and carry the movie with the sort of ease that only seasoned comic professionals possess. By the end of it, you'll have been entertained as well as engaged emotionally and I can't think of another comedy that does both equally well.There's hardly a thing to dislike about this film. It has stood the test of time remarkably well and offers younger viewers who may have missed it a wonderfully funny and unmissable comedy, though the hilarious scene at the car rental desk might have some parents reaching for the mute button. It's always sad to see careers head south and comparing this to some of Martin's latest offerings will make most viewers shake their heads in disappointment and mutter something about doing it for the money.

Planes, Trains & Automobiles tells the story of big-shot advertising executive Neal Page (Steve Martin) as he tries to get home to Chicago from New York in time for Thanksgiving. His unintentionally circuitous journey throws him into the company of shower curtain-ring salesman Del Griffith (the late John Candy). This movie is, at its core, a classic odd-couple story. Page is wealthy, pompous and a snob. Lacking in social skills, he is aloof with strangers and quick to lose his temper when things go wrong. In complete contrast, Del is down-to-earth, chatty, easy-going and seems to blend effortlessly into any situation. The huge contrast between these two characters is the source of most of the movie's comedy. They stay together (despite Neal Page's wishes) simply because they need each other. Neal is a complete fish out of water when his travel plans go awry, whereas Del, as a travelling salesman has seen it all before. On the other hand, Neal has the financial means to deal with things which Del, as an unsuccessful travelling salesman, does not. Consequently, Del has no choice but to deal with Neal's intolerant attitude and snobbery and Neal has to get used to Del's gross personal habits and overbearing personality. For me, one of this movie's most enduring charms is that it features mostly ordinary working-class Americans, away from the aspirational upper-middle-class environments that Hollywood usually sticks with.

It's such a tragedy that John Candy is no longer with us - he was a hilarious guy, and never more so than in this film. What could have been just a wacky, dime-a-dozen bad taste comedy turns out to be a heart-warming feel-good movie with real emotional depth, thanks in no small part to Candy's performance here.Planes, Trains & Automobiles was a significant departure for John Hughes, who was previously best known for teen angst high school comedies such as Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club. Steve Martin is a cynical, highly-strung marketing executive who is flying home to Chicago for a family Thanksgiving dinner, only for his flight to be cancelled. On the way, he has the misfortune to bump into John Candy, a bumbling blabbermouth who makes a living selling shower curtain rings, and who is on the way to Chicago too. Steve hates poor John from the outset, but manages to rub along with him through the chaos of cancelled flights, shared hotel rooms (and double beds!), exploding cars and broken-down trains, in the vain hope that he gets back home to his family before the turkey goes cold. Of course, along the way, he decides that he doesn't half like old John after all, and they become reluctant buddies.The happiness fades to tragedy when John reveals that his loving wife died eight years previously, and that he no longer has a home - the travelling life is now all he knows. Steve is sufficiently touched by this that he invites John home for an extra-large portion of turkey, and they all live happily ever after. Hooray!There are so many funny moments it's difficult to pick a favourite. The moment when Steve realises he's been drying his face with Candy's Y-fronts, the spooning scene in the motel room bed, the various mishaps with the rental car - these are all up there. The F-word fest when Steve finally confronts the smug car rental clerk is also hilarious, even if it is a little bit incongruous in what is otherwise a family comedy (without this scene, the film could easily have been a PG). Mind you, part of it's appeal is that it's unexpected - it wouldn't have been half as funny if the rest of the movie was peppered with cuss words.Kevin Bacon's scene early in the movie is great - the facial expressions are priceless - but he was a little bit wasted here, as he doesn't crop up again later in the film. I have heard that a much longer cut of the movie exists in Paramount's archives, and I have to wonder if there was an entire subplot involving Bacon that ended up on the cutting room floor. (Note to Paramount a Special Edition DVD release is sorely needed!) What else can I say - it's John Hughes's best movie bar none, and it's John Candy's finest hour too. You must see this.

It should be but it ain't because Neil has the misfortune of sharing the trip with a kind-hearted yet hugely irritating shower-curtain ring salesman named Del Griffith to help him on his way. From the moment these two meet in New York there are events that have to be seen to be believed. John Hughes is to be commended for making such a movie that you can watch again and again and never stop laughing from beginning to end. I think it is Hughes' keen eye for the Midwest that makes this movie so truly funny, very real characters at every stop that you can relate to and say, yeah, I remember a guy like that. Most of all, however, is Del Griffith, John Candy's greatest role. Del is someone who everyone has met in their life and probably try to avoid for the most part but Hughes shows a man that has an unreal ability for irritation but within that is a person that is truly a warm hearted, lovable and real man as well. The ending will make you teary eyed unless you have a heart of stone. The rest of the movie will have you memorizing lines like 'those aren't pillows', 'people train runs outta Stubbville' and Flintstones, meet the Flintstones.

It stars Steve Martin and John Candy at the peak of their careers, sadly John died, but Steve is still around, but I, for one don't think he's been in anything this good. The joys of travel during Thanksgiving are the setting for this comedy. Probably one of the most famous and funny scenes is the pillow Scene when Neal and Del sleep in the same bed in a less than 4 star motel. The rent-a-car exchange with Neal and bubbly Edie McClurg is a classic. Almost non-stop laughs and a sentimental finish make this a must-see.

He accidentally teams up with overbearing Candy, who becomes his traveling companion.One of the best comedies I've ever seen, doesn't lessen a bit after countless viewings. Most modern day comedies don't have the perfect balance between overt sentiment and outrageous comic sequences as some titles back in the eighties. Planes is one of those perfect examples. Martin and Candy are both rich, multi-layered and flushed out characters who the viewer comes to care about and that's practically nonexistent in modern comedies. Some real heartfelt moments occur along the way and both leads are extremely good whether they're playing it completely straight or go a bit overboard. Despite some sentimental moments the film also has some of the most memorable, outrageous comical sequences that make you burst into laughter and reach for the pause button to stable yourself.John Hughes does a great job in both the writing and directing department. It's a shame there's no real market for films like these today. "},{"Title":"Better than I remembered (spoilers)","Date":"11 January 2006","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Not having seen it for a fair few years I was rather surprised at how much I enjoyed Planes, Trains and Automobiles. I mean, I've always liked it and I've always know that it's funny, but I'd kind of forgotten just how good it is. And it's very good indeed.The first bit that had me laughing was the showdown with Kevin Bacon, where he and Neal Page (Steve Martin) are trying to get a cab. It's a scene I've seen numerous times, and I could pretty much remember exactly what happens and when it happens, but I'd forgotten one little bit there's a bit where Neal is running along the pavement and he gets temporarily held up by a black guy. They stand in front of each other, trying to get past, but the black guy is almost break dancing. I don't know why, but I found it damned hilarious. I think it was just how silly it was.Soon after there's another tiny little moment that cracked me up. Neal has rushed to the airport but he's missed his plane, so he has to sit opposite Del (John Candy). He looks at him for a while, trying to remember where he knows him from (he stole his cab) and then it clicks. But instead of a quick flashback to the scene on the New York street where Neal opens the taxi door and sees Del's startled face, Del, while sitting on a chair in front of him, is framed in a taxi door and he briefly recreates the startled expression. Again it's the silliness I like.But while the film is silly, it works so well because it keeps a decent grip on reality. The two main characters, an advertising executive and a travelling salesman, seem like people you could actually meet. And although no one (hopefully) would experience the accumulation of events these characters experience, on their own they're more than feasible.My favourite cock up (for lack of a better term) is when they have to share the motel room. But my favourite moment isn't the bit when they wake up together. As good as that is, there's another moment I like more. It's the moment when Neal sees the double bed. Some nervous, disjointed music immediately starts playing and the camera slowly pans around to Del, who looks just as shocked. However, he quickly cracks an awkward grin. It's fantastically played, and the pay-off is when Del asks Neal if he wants to take a shower. For a second Neal thinks Del is coming onto him and Del quickly realises his mistake, leading to yet more nervous banter. But the scene's great because it captures that anxiety you get when you unexpectedly find that you have to share your private space with a stranger. You don't know whether they're going to bore you or rape you.Thankfully Neal is merely bored by Del &#150; or irritated to put it more accurately. And this leads to another excellent bit where Neal tears Del to shreds. He has a go at him and instead of stopping he just goes on and on and on. And although he speaks the truth, it really is too much. And even Neal realises he's gone too far. But what the exchange does so well is that it shifts your sympathies. Before you feel sorry for Neal being stuck with this blabbermouth. But then with Del's dignified response, it's him you feel sorry for; he tries to help this yuppie jerk and all he gets is a mouthful of abuse in return.However, this moment isn't dwelt upon and the comedy soon resumes with the famous pillow scene. But even funnier than that is when some hick drives Neal and Del to the train station. I particularly like the line about the hick's wife giving birth sideways but not screaming. She'd make a cracking Scientologist. And of course, the shot of the frozen dog is priceless.I have to say, out of planes, trains and automobiles; the automobile section has to be the best. It starts off with a torrent of F-words that had me beside myself with mirth as a kid and continues with Neal getting picked up by his balls and Del burning their car to bits. But again it's one of the little bits that makes me laugh the most. It's the bit when Neal and Del are driving in the wrong direction. When they see the trucks approaching, Neal almost starts spazzing, and then for a brief moment he sees Del dressed as the Devil, cackling like a madman. Genius.But the icing on the cake, the thing that makes me feel so affectionately towards the film, is the ending. I mean, as a kid it was the dull sappy bit that came after the laughs. But now it's the wonderful bit where a grown man gets all choked up.The revelation that Del is homeless and lost his wife eight years previously could have been the cue for some maudlin tripe. But instead it rounds Del's character perfectly. You know why he's so desperate to latch onto somebody. Plus it gives more emotion to previous scenes where Del says that his wife likes him and when Neal makes a toast, saying that at the very least Del has someone to grow old with. Therefore it's a beautiful moment when, after hearing this, you cut to Neal and Del walking to Neal's house. They're finally standing together side-by-side as friends, carrying Del's trunk &#150; that very moment, as well as making me misty-eyed, also puts a huge, soppy grin on my face. At last the uptight yuppie is capable of empathy and at last Del is understood and accepted. It's one of my favourite endings in any film cheesy 80s music + lovable fat man = emotion.

He has a job a businessman, is married, and has a good family. His job requires him to travel a lot, sometimes even near holidays. Planes, Trains and Automobiles details Neal's quest to return home for Thanksgiving, literally using every mode of transportation mentioned in the title.In the realm of movie clichés, anyone trying to get anywhere to meet some kind of deadline will encounter what seems to be an entire world full of people with the single purpose of delaying the hero. Neal Page (Steve Martin) needs no such world; the force of one man is all he needs to stand in his way. This man is Del Griffith (John Candy), the inescapable cause for all of Neal's troubles.Del starts off by stealing Neal's cab, thereby threatening Neal with the possibility of missing his flight. As can be expected in a comedy of this genre, Neal uses extraordinary means to get to the airport on time, makes his flight&#133; only to encounter Del yet again, and only to be beset by further delays. Repeat this formula for 90 minutes, raise the stakes as you go along, and you've got yourself a pretty funny, if far-fetched, movie.Planes, Trains and Automobiles reaches greatness not with its material, but with its fine acting from Steve Martin and John Candy. Both do an excellent job portraying men at the end of their respective ropes. Both also have a great sense of comedic timing, making jokes that otherwise would fall flat work.This isn't any outstanding example of cinema, American or otherwise; it's just a good movie. A little better than middle-of-the-road, but comfortably and enjoyably so. Not every movie needs to try to be groundbreaking and cutting-edge, and this one wisely doesn't. Based on what the performers have done with what they've been given, and especially in light of the upbeat message about friendship and family contained in the tail end of the film, this movie deserves a better-than-average B.

Steve Martin and John Candy make an awesome team.  The contrast between the characters only adds to the movie.  The movie was good in almost every aspect, except the rating.Steve Martin plays Neil Page, a semi-uptight, very sarcastic person simply trying to get home for the holidays.  John Candy plays Dell Griffith, a very personable man only trying to be friends.  Together, they provide 93 minutes of comedy.  With their personalities colliding in ways that people would not think was even possible, they get themselves into situation after situation.  Many times, these situations are completely ridiculous, and often not probable, but that is what makes them funny.  The only downfall to this movie is the rating.  The movie is rated R for one main reason, the scene in the airport.  In this scene, the `F-word' is used probably 15-20 times in one conversation.  After being dropped off at his rental car (that was not there) he hiked back to the airport and started swearing at the attendant.  This scene was completely unnecessary, but I can understand why they may have put it in there.  During the time period that this movie was released, many people didn't bother seeing a movie that was not rated R.  It is said that this scene was included so they could bump the rating up.  This scene may have added to the ticket sales, but definitely not to the movie.Overall, this movie is good.  John Candy and Steve Martin will have you laughing all the way through the movie.

This film made quite an impression with such a performance.  The two contradicted each other and in turn cancel each other out with their wit.  This reviewer was entranced by such an overwhelming performance that was achieved by a simple story line of two people trying to get home.It is almost amazing how the director was able to make the two characters face so many misguidings throughout the span of the entire movie...the story kept throwing punches at the characters, as if it weren't meant to make it home.  But they are able to beat the odds, as infinite as they are, and make it home just in time.But the way the adversity keeps coming and coming is what adds depth to the movie, in the reviewer's opinion.  If there were only two or three problems that needed to be dealt with, then there would be hardly any story...and John Hughes was able to accomplish that and more.  This film is worthy of being one of the best comedies any audience can see.

All you have to do is get from here to there.  But that's when Murphy's Law concerning best laid plans often comes into play, and the simplest things become obstacles of monumental proportions, which is exactly what happens in `Planes, Trains and Automobiles,' a comedy of monumental proportions, written and directed by John Hughes.  Neal Page (Steve Martin) is in New York on business; it's two days before Thanksgiving and he has a plane waiting to take him back home to Chicago.  He has his reservation, and it's not that far to go; but it's a holiday and the weather is chancy, and beginning with the trouble Neal has just getting a cab to take him to the airport, he's about to become mired in frustration as one thing after another thwarts his attempts to get home.  Not to worry, however, once on the plane he meets a guy named Del Griffith (John Candy), a showercurtain-ring salesman with all the answers and connections in seemingly every city in the country.  Which comes in handy-- or maybe not-- for Neal, when the weather in Chicago forces a closure at the airport and his flight gets diverted to Wichita, Kansas.  But that's only the beginning of Neal's problems, because Del Griffith is on the job, and he's the guy to know in a situation like this.  Or not.  And the next couple of days become a comedy of errors that takes Neal to the edge of sanity and the audience to the edge of hilarity.	An astute student of human nature, John Hughes takes his observations and insights and translates them in this film into a story with which just about anyone is going to be able to identify.  We've all been in Neal's situation at one time or another, in one way or another, and if you've lived more than a day on the planet you certainly know a Del Griffith.  And Hughes has a way of bringing you into Neal and Del's world so that you are able to share their experience, while at the same time affording you the luxury of being able to observe it all at arm's length, which enables you to see the `big picture' and appreciate the inherent humor of it all.  And the bottom line is, this movie is a riot.  There's something of the spirit of Jack Lemmon's `The Out-of-Towners' about it, the whole idea of nature seemingly conspiring against the little guy, that keeps the laughs coming; and Hughes couldn't have had anyone better than Martin and Candy to put it across more successfully.	Martin has an inspired way with physical comedy-- he can make walking down the street funny-- and he infuses it with a subtle, underlying sense that something is always going on inside him that's just as funny as what he's showing you.  It creates an air of anticipation, and he never fails to deliver on that promise.  Like Lemmon, he has the ability to play the ordinary guy in an extraordinary situation in a very real way, and then take it to the limit without going over the top.  And when the reserved, inner turmoil finally erupts, it has you laughing until your sides ache.  It's Lemmon standing in the middle of the street railing at the city of New York, and Martin confronting a rental car clerk and spelling it out for her in no uncertain terms what he thinks of her, her cars and life in general at that particular moment in time.  It's pure humor, and it works so well because there's absolutely nothing mean-spirited in the way it's delivered, which is something for which Martin-- and Lemmon before him-- deserves a nod of appreciation and acknowledgement; it's a fine art that few comic actors are, in fact, able to master.  	John Candy, meanwhile, puts his own natural abilities to the test in creating a character in Del that is the antithesis of Neal.  And he passes with flying colors.  Del is the big, lovable goof who wears his heart on his sleeve and holds nothing back.  With Del, what you see is what you get, and there's not a thought that goes through his mind, apparently, that he doesn't feel obliged to share with anyone and everyone who will listen.  Everything about Del is externalized to the point of being overwhelming, and yet Candy manages to convey the feeling that even he has something locked away that is for himself alone, and it's that which makes Del a well rounded character and makes him real.  Like Martin's, Candy's is a performance that is rich in detail and humanity, which makes Del believable, and a memorable character.  Candy was perfect for this part, one that he was seemingly born to play.  And he makes the most of it.	The supporting cast includes Laila Robins (Susan), Michael McKean (State Trooper), Dylan Baker (Owen), Edie McClurg (Car Rental Agent) and Charles Tyner (Gus), with cameos by Kevin Bacon and William Windom.  More than just a funny movie, but one which exemplifies the `human comedy,' `Planes, Trains and Automobiles' is a triumph for Hughes, but more especially for his stars, Martin and Candy, who demonstrate a refined understanding of human nature and behavior through their respective characters that makes this film so endearing, memorable and entertaining.  This is one to watch again and again, whenever you're in need of a good laugh or just something to put a smile on your face.  This is one that will definitely fill the bill.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.

My customers like me. 'Cause I'm the real article. Whatcha see is whatcha get.The truthfulness of this comedy!What makes John Hughes's PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES work, compared to other films of the genre, is its characters. By the time the credits role, or even before then, we feel for them quite deeply. Unlike some crude comedy such as TOMMY BOY or BLACK SHEEP, PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES is intelligent, moving, funny, touching, and puts a tear in my eye every time I watch it. A lot of other comedies out there can disturb me or not make me feel anything. When Paul Young's revamped song flows towards the end credits, I cry. This is a touching, touching comedy, made only all the more touching because of the death of comedy's great subtle character actor, John Candy. Unlike Chris Farley (TOMMY BOY), his laughs depend on actual intelligence. And he can act -- check out the scene in the motel room. Touching, funny, sad, enthralling.The IMDb user TxMike calls the film a dark comedy, with the ending slapped on in a careless, redeeming manner, as to justify the film. I doubt he even saw it. This isn't a crude, dark comedy with hurtful jokes that suddenly slaps on a touching end. Not only is Del's background hinted at FROM THE BEGINNING, we learn to care about the characters and THAT is why the ending is NOT simply a redemption ploy. Besides, how is the film dark? Mr. TxMike says because it was filmed at winter, giving it a bleak and dark look, both literally and figuratively. First off, it's winter, what in the world did you expect -- summertime? And secondly, all comedy is hurtful in one way or another. It has been through the ages. I think Roger Ebert once wrote, Comedy is more painful than truth. So just because the characters get hurt in this movie (punch in the face, punch in the gut, etc.) does not mean it's dark comedy. TxMike, get a clue. This is a wonderful, touching comedy, and one of the lightest I've ever seen. It is certainly not dark in any way, shape or form.4/4 for this wonderful heartwarming little comedy heart tugger!

It has become a tradition and perhaps even a necessity.Neal Page (Steve Martin, back when he was funny) is a Marketing Exec who has just made a pointless trip to New York 2 days before Thanksgiving. The inconclusive meeting in question ends just half an hour before his flight back home. If he hurries, he'll catch the flight no problem and be home with the family before he knows it. Right? Well, no. There are no cabs on Wall Street. After being hustled out of $75 for a cab someone else hailed it promptly takes off with passenger unknown. But no matter, the airport has delayed the flight because of snow. In the waiting lounge, Neal meets Del Griffith (John Candy, man do I miss him!), a shower curtain ring salesman and the very man who went off in his Taxi. Despite Del's insistence on making it up to Neal, he fobs him off and remains in a mood.Once on board the plane the fussy Flight Attendant seats him in coach as there was a mistake with his first class ticket. Guess who he is sat beside? Del of course. And he blabs on and on, telling unfunny, unamusing anecdotes to an increasingly squashed and uncomfortable Neal.A huge snowstorm in Chicago results in the plane being diverted hundreds of miles, all the way down to Wichita, Kansas. Neal is forced to spend the night with Del in a unbelievably seedy motel...in the same bed. That night they are robbed and left with nothing but their credit cards. Since Del is a massive slob who leaves his dirty socks in the sink, crumbs and wrappers everywhere and spills beer on the bed, Neal would like nothing more than to ditch him and get on with his long journey home alone.It's here that the emotional punch of the movie really kicks in. Neal is arrogant and selfish but Del stills sees some good in him and would like nothing more than to be his best buddy. But he is repeatedly kicked aside and ignored as the two of them inch their way home. Fate crosses their paths over and over and Neal is pretty much only temporarily sticking with him to serve himself. Candy's need for a pal and his frustration at Neal only becomes apparent after the first viewing as it's the shocking twist ending that makes you add up his character and emotions.At the time this film was already brilliant, but it's the fact that Del Griffith and John Candy are almost one and the same that makes it that extra bit special. Both were friendly, chatty and tried really hard to be liked. And now that Candy is gone forever you can't help but really, really feel for him and see the trouble he is going through despite his best efforts to hide it. Neal and Del may be opposites but as they both struggle through setback after setback they eventually come to empathise and understand each other. I dare you not be moved to tears when Del is sitting alone in the train station and confesses his secret to Neal. If you are not crying then you truly have no soul. The film ain't just an emotional character drama. It's also a road movie with loads of snow covered middle-America scenery and is extremely funny and packed with classic scenes. Anyone who has seen it already will know what I mean when I say 'THOSE AREN'T PILLOWS!' Del driving on the wrong side of the highway will suffocate you as will Neal's confrontation with the rental car receptionist, the character of Owen (Dylan Baker) and his nasal problems.Ocassionaly, James Ira Newborn's score can be a bit distracting and even slightly inappropriate, but there are some deeply emotional cues in there that can easily shift the mood of a scene. Inconsistent it may be but overall it's better than most comedic scores. Planes, Trains and Automobiles is an eternal tribute to how great Martin used to be before he sold himself out to family movies and how wonderful John Candy was as an actor and a person. For him alone this film gets 10/10. He was brilliant and died far too young, but in his short career he did give us some unforgettable stuff and this movie is certainly one of them.

This film was released in 1986 and today is still holding its ground and being played on television every Thanksgiving.Planes, Trains and Automobiles stars Steve Martin as Neil Page and John Candy as Dell Griffith. Immediately you get the impression that Neil (Martin) is a working stiff that likes everything to be in order. Dell(Candy) on the other hand is an annoying sales man, who doesn't know when to shut up. This odd couple creates hilarious comedy.The plot of this film is a working man named (Martin) is trying to get from New York to go home to Chicago for thanksgiving with his family. Things immediately go wrong when Neil leaves his office and runs into a man (Candy) who steals his cab and they become unwilling travel partners.There are a lot of unique shots in this film that complement it very well. After Dell steals Neil's cab, they end up sitting across from each other at the airport. They both stare at each other until Dell says `do I know you?' Then all of a sudden a cab door appears in front of Dells face and Neil replies `you stole my cab!' Another scene is where Neil and Dell are traveling in a rental car (still trying to get home) and they unknowingly end up on the wrong side of the road until they see two semi trucks heading right for them and the camera shows both men looking at each other, as they reach the trucks sparks are flying and Neil and Dell turn into skeletons. Then the camera turns to Dell again and he's in a devil suite laughing. This scene leaves the viewer wondering what the heck just happened but also leaves the viewer laughing. The music in the film is also very unique; because it plays a wide variety of background music. In one scene, there is up beat islander music playing as Dell is trying to sell shower curtain rings to women as earrings. After Neil gets to the airport to pick up his rental car and finds out that it has been stolen, he goes ballistic and 80's techno music is playing very loudly. Then, in another scene, Dell is driving and has the radio playing loudly as he's singing along to `Do the mess around'.There is not much to the costumes in this movie, its mainly normal people wearing normal clothing. But throughout almost the whole film, Dell is wearing a blue parka that looks very funny on him. The only real costume that was used in this film was the devil costume that Dell wore in the car scene, which was very funny but not realistic because neither Dell nor John Candy is Satan. Not only are the scenes funny but the facial and physical comedy adds a lot of spice to the film. But most of all, it's all the one liners that both of the characters say that makes this such a good film and a classic comedy that can be watched over and over again every year.

This duo embark on a series of misadventures as Neal wants to do everything he can to get to his humble abode in Chicago from New York City to be with the kin for Thanksgiving only to wind up in a semi-condemned hotel in Wichita, Kansas laying on a beer drenched mattress. The pairing of Martin and Candy were perfectly cast as both possess comedic charm that compliments each other rather than trying to upstage each other. Even though they handle the physical scenes quite subliminally, they also progressively get to understand each other a lot more better which this comedy stands out from the other ones being that the character development plays an equally pivotal role rather than just the physical drive of each character. In other words this may be a comedy, but it has some teeth to go with it.Under the direction and penmanship of John Hughes who at the time was directing Brat Pack films at the time like The Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles, step aside from his domain in this movie, but one thing that still remains the same is that his characters have multi-layered arcs and not lazily dependent on clichéd characters and his movies help mold the way an adolescent themed film should be in the Hollywood industry. There will be some sort of serious undercurrent involved his character/s no matter how extravagant the situation each character encounters. Sure this is not a teen movie with conflicts and tribulations of making it big in the real world, I mean, come on, we have Neal and Del drenched in their clothes with beer on a soaked-up mattress in Kansas. Sure this is a comedy for laughs only, but in the end there is a tender sweetness behind it all and once the laughs die down, it will likely generate your heartstrings with a caressing feeling inside of you. With a couple of days away from Thanksgiving, stiff-jawed marketing executive Neal Page is hopping a taxi to go to La Guardia airport to fly to O'Hare to spend some time with his family, only to be bitten with bad luck when Del Griffith steals the ride instead. The end up running into each other at La Guardia where but unfortunately, the flight to Chicago has been sidelined due to bad weather. Page confronts Griffith and when they finally board a plane, Page gets demoted from his first class seat and is forced to sit next to Griffith whom his still has a bone to pick with him. The plane ends up getting sidetracked and winds up in Wichita, Kansas but however Griffith who has some connections due to the success of his shower curtain business manages to find them a frugal hotel with one room and one bed. This was just the starting of a two day trip to hell for Mr. Page as he yells at Mr. Griffith for being a snoring, smoking, despot with a horrible foot stench and equally cheesy jokes. His jokes couldn't be that bad now can they? Well let's just say that an insurance seminar would be more entertaining then another one of Griffith's boring anecdotes. At this point Griffith feels hurt, but doesn't take it personally. All he wanted to do was to make light of temporary setback,only he blew it by going way overboard. The next morning at Wichita airport, Page bids farewell to Griffith in hopes he can finally get back to Chicago but then these two ironically meet once again and eventually go cross-country by trains, buses, semi-trailer trucks and cars. Eventually they wind up in southern Illinois where they're questioned by a state trooper why are they in car that has both crashed and burned. The laughs are very plentiful in this movie. The best scene was when they're in bed together in a rather seductive state and when they finally awake to their senses they start going over the latest Bears game. This was truly an exhilarating comedy, but their's more layers than just comedy. Mostly because Hughes adds more insight to the main characters and we get a better view of their relationship and summarize that though they may have contrasting perspectives of life, there's a lot of similarities between the two of them. It's a really fun comedy that has a lot of heart to it.

These films succeed enormously as they are watched by all members of the family. For director John Hughes, 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles' was a new creative experience as he moved away from the depiction of themes of teenagers which was present in his older films. Although the essence of the film is to be found in its apt title, viewers should watch this film in order to experience some 'over the top' comic performances by actors Steve Martin and John Candy. These actors challenge the very notion of privacy for which America is known. It is as if one has to listen to whatever the other person is saying no matter however boring it might be. The idea of male bonding is depicted with all earnestness as it takes more than mere interest in each other's personality to appreciate somebody who is just different. Travelling is fun when one makes wise use of all available means of transport. However, it is going to become more memorable when one doesn't travel alone.

He is subjected to being with annoying and well meaning chatterbox, Del Griffith (John Candy) who sells shower rings. Due to a violent snowstorm, the plane is grounded in Kansas, Neal reluctantly accepts an invitation from Del to stay at a motel. The whole motel bit is when the laughter starts getting out of control and when Neal finally gives Del a piece of his mind. The movie is very funny up to that point, but here is when it really takes off. From then on, Neal must do all he can to get home in time for the turkey while Del helps get him in and out of trouble and really annoys the hell out of him, but Neal gets used to him and starts seeing the good in him. That is what makes this movie timeless and always relevant. Neal is so preoccupied that he can't see the good around him. Sure everything seems to be screwing him over, but it is what Neal perceives. Sure Del maybe the most annoying person in the world, but it is what Neal perceives. Del really is annoying, but who doesn't have wacky friends like that? It is about learning to love those around you and see the good in people. It is also about having patience. Neal's patience with Del wears thin, but he is too loving and fun not to love back.

It will feed your laughter.","Date":"28 November 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Happy Thanksgiving, everybody! Be thankful that you don't have to travel cross country like the characters of this film has to go through. Directed by John Hughes, Planes, Trains and Automobiles is about high-strung marketing executive, Neil Page (Steve Martin), who unfortunately, has every mode of transportation somehow fails him. Worst yet, he is stuck with eternally optimistic, overly talkative, and clumsy shower curtain ring salesman, Del Griffith (John Candy) who seem to have Murphy Law follow him everywhere. Through delayed planes, broken down trains and burned-out automobiles, both share a three-day odyssey of misadventures as both of them try to get home to Chicago from New York City in time for Thanksgiving dinner with their families. I love the tagline for the film, 'he really wanted was to spend Thanksgiving with his family. What he got was three days with the turkey'. The main premise of the story is Neal trying to get home for the Thanksgiving holiday, and that, no matter how dire things might seem, we all have something to be thankful for. It's delivered in such a way that even non-Americans can appreciate. It really fit the mood of the film. The movie is supposedly based on a real life event, where it took John Hughes five days to get from New York City to Chicago because of a plane delay that left him in Wichita, Kansas. Since no transportation company wanted to appear inept or deficient in any way, the production for this film became really stressful. They had to construct a set that looked like airline terminal, design a rent-a-car company logo and uniforms, rent twenty miles of train track and refurbish old railroad cars, wait for the weather to clear up or not clear up and rent 250 cars for the infamous Rent-a-Car sequence. The film is probably best known for the sole scene responsible for its R rating; in which Neal goes on a tirade. Honestly, the movie could had been PG-13, but the whole f-word gag was too good to pass off on. To avoid being pigeonholed as a maker of teen comedies, John Hughes really work hard on this film, shooting and editing it. Supposedly, there is an uncut three-hour version of the film that some people like to see, one day. In my opinion, I'm alright with this version. I do kinda don't mind the delete scene with the airline food. The movie is very creative. I love how the title of the film zooms horizontally across the screen in screen-high letters to the earsplitting sound of an airplane taking off, then a train and finally a car. Some people might not like this film due to its odd choice of music score that sound like weird early rap beats and hair metal, but I kinda dig it. It had that 1980s' vibe to it. I love the fact that the movie could be all in the same universe, as his other films like 1984's Sixteen Candles, 1985's The Breakfast Club, 1986's Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and others. I love the cameos from actors like Ben Stein & Edie McClurg. I also like how Neal's family home is actually in the same neighborhood as the house in 1990's Home Alone. According to Hughes, Del lived two houses away from character, John Bender (Judd Nelson) from the Breakfast Club. The movie also has a very strong connection to the film, 1988's 'She's having a Baby' with many of that movie, characters appearing in this film such as Jake Briggs (Kevin Bacon) & Russ Bainbridge (William Windom). Even the film 'She's Having a Baby was playing in the background on TV when Mrs. Page (Laila Robins) was trying to go to sleep. The acting is very good for the most part from the two men. A lot of people might hate this film, due to the overused odd couple shtick, but I think this film is one of the better, strange bedfellow films. Steve Martin was great as the straight man. You really feel for him as he only wants to go home. John Candy is good as well. There were some gross out humor that wasn't needed, but it didn't hurt the film. The slapstick humor was alright in the most part. I was laughing my head off, during the driving parts. John Candy had just enough charm to make him, not that annoying. Both Martin and Candy work really well together. Films like 2010's Due Date & 1991's Dutch, wish they could had pull something like this film chemistry off. I love how John Candy was in most of John Hughes's films. This film was the inspiration for his cameo appearance as Gus Polinski, the Polka King of the Midwest, in Home Alone. The movie has a really good twist bittersweet ending that makes the film have a lot of heart. Lots of good foreshadowing unto them. Without spoiling it, just take a close look at the stickers on Del's luggage. Overall It's a very funny heart-warming film that is great to watch, during the holidays. A must watch. This film is good turkey to cut into.

Or, the evil looking taxi and its scenic routing-taking driver.Martin's tirade in the motel room against Candy is hilarious, yet at the same time quite hurtful- we both laugh at that scene and genuinely feel sorry for Candy's character.Another hilarious, infamous sequence has Martin's mild mannered businessman going bonkers, in a profanity-ridden tirade in a car rental agency (notice, even the agent working next to Edie McClurg during his meltdown starting at him) John Candy and Steve Martin have such impeccable timing and wonderful sense of delivery, that even lines of dialogue which are not necessarily funny are so well delivered as to make them funny (You broke the seat. You broke the goddamn seat! right before Candy obliviously drives down the wrong way on a highway) Candy miming and playing piano, jamming out and doing the Mess Around The rental car going up in flames, Wow! Ironically, if we listen carefully to the television news broadcast as Martin's wife is drifting off to sleep, we learn that the weather has cleared up, and flights are resuming as scheduled- meaning that if the two men had stayed at the airport, they could have caught their flight after a short delay!A hilariously funny movie that I never get tired of, no matter how many times I watch it. The only problem with the film is its putrid score, which sounds like a muted trumpet backed by a crappy little synthesizer, and samples of the film's dialogue throughout.And if you disagree with anything I've said (typed) here, fine then!

They share a three-day odyssey of misadventures trying to get Neal home to Chicago from New York City in time for Thanksgiving dinner with his family.Laila Robins,Michael McKean,Kevin Bacon and Dylan Baker co-star in key supporting roles.En route to Chicago to spend Thanksgiving with his family, easily annoyed businessman Neal Page finds his first-class plane ticket has been demoted to coach, and he must share his flight with obnoxious salesman Del Griffith. A sudden snowstorm in Chicago forces the plane to land in Wichita. Unable to find a room in any of the four-star hotels, Neal is compelled to accept Del's invitation to share his accommodations in a cheap motel. Driven to distraction by Del's annoying personal habits, the ungrateful Neal lets forth with a stream of verbal abuse. The shamefaced Neal tries to make up to Del, but there's a bumpy time ahead as the mismatched pair make their way back to Chicago, first in a balky train, then by way of a refrigerator truck.This is a surprisingly powerful, and incredibly funny movie led by two terrific performances in the leads in Steve Martin and John Candy and John Hughes' razor sharp script.

Steve Martin is the fall guy in this one, so he adroitly gives a rather restrained performance, allowing John Candy to go over the top -- which he does! A little too gross at times, Candy does handle his final scenes rather well. Martin is no slouch either. The movie is dominated by the two comedians. An hour or so after seeing the movie, you don't really remember any of the other fleetingly introduced characters, except maybe the needs-a-spittoon joker who reminds our heroes that unless they happen to be steers or broncs, they can't board a train at Wichita. Stubbsville, thirty miles away, is where you board a people train! Well, we would have liked to see a bit more of the people train before taking to the road again, but nonetheless, a glimpse is better than nothing, and we do ride the rails briefly in Chicago as well.

Not only wonderful comedians, but wonderful actors, ably assisted by John Hughes' direction and his script.Reminiscent of The Out of Towners, this is another calamity-filled travel film, except that instead of it focusing on the problems in a city, it focuses on the problems of two guys, Del Griffith (Candy) and Neal Page (Martin). Neal's problem is Griffith. Griffith's problem is he's a Jonah.Neal, a businessman currently in New York, is trying to get back to his family in Chicago for Thanksgiving and is going to be late for a plane if he doesn't get to the airport immediately. He loses one cab when he falls in the street while racing another guy (a cameo by Kevin Bacon) for it, and he loses a second when it is inadvertently taken by Del. To Neal's horror, he runs into Del, a shower curtain ring salesman, at the airport, and Del sticks to him like Crazy Glue. This is the beginning of a disastrous trip that involves a plane, the Bates motel, a train, a bus, a car, a couple of trucks, a Cujo type dog, you name it.There are some hilarious scenes in this film as well as some poignant ones. The scene in the hotel when Neal goes off totally on Del, who just stands there and takes it, is a riot. Another great scene is Del trying to raise money, and another one occurs when they're getting a ride from the son of a friend of Del. The guy shows up and orders his wife to put Del's trunk in the back of the truck. A must-see, I won't give it away.Laila Robins is lovely as Neal's wife. Martin and Candy are very funny together. Martin of course can write, act in drama, and do comedy. Candy had a gift that matched his size, not only for comedy but for dramatic acting.

It looks like things are on the up when they catch a train heading for Chicago; that is until the locomotive dies. After a short bus ride they hire a car which Del manages to set on fire! This film is a delightful mixture of comedy and pathos; Del might be incredibly annoying but he is also a genuinely nice guy who means no harm so in the scene where Neal snaps and tells him just what he thinks of him it starts of funny but the viewer eventually sympathises with Del despite everything he has done... and he has done a lot! Steve Martin does a great job as Neal; a man who starts of close to breaking point and eventually snaps and John Candy is just about perfect as Del, it can't be easy to make a character that annoying be sympathetic. There are too many laugh out loud moments to mention them individually; besides I wouldn't want to spoil them. The one thing about this film that I wasn't so keen on it was one scene which was VERY sweary; had the whole film been like that I probably wouldn't have bothered but it does mean a film that would otherwise have been a decent family film isn't really suitable for younger viewers.

Although there talents were appreciate, there was always a tinge of disappointment that their obvious comedic gift was wasted in decidedly low brow comedy. By all rights Planes, Trains and Automobiles should fall into this category, 90 minutes of box office fodder, and yet it doesn't, for this film has an emotional impact to go along with irresistibly funny comedy.The premise reads very much like a particularly uninspired sitcom; two mismatched men are thrust together by a chance meeting on a plane journey and horrifyingly unlucky transport issues, spending 3 eventful days together as they overcome numerous mishaps to make it home to spend thanksgiving with their families. However the film goes much deeper then that, exploring a relationship between two men that very much reflects a friendship accelerated over a couple of days, with an unbreakable bond emerging from a strenuous journey of seemingly insurmountable problems.A pivotal scene in the film is when Steve Martin, tired with a long day of John Candy's incessant ramblings lashes out at the lovable but tiresome character, declaring that an insurance seminar would be light entertainment compared to the jabberings of his new companion. In return, Candy says I'm not changing. I like&#x85; I like me. My wife likes me. My customers like me. 'Cause I'm the real article. What you see is what you get. This outpouring of raw emotion, accompanied by Martin's look of shame sets the tone, that amongst the shenanigans, director John Hughes is delivering character development not often seen in comedy, as Steve Martin's character learns to emphasise and to stop isolating himself from society beyond his own social circle, whilst Candy realises that he is overbearing and irritating, addressing his character to deal with this. And amongst this character development there is classic comedy to accompany, with the highlight being Steve Martins exchange with a car rental agent, in which the word fuck is used 17 times in a minute. Whilst some jokes seem a tad predictable, the majority are outright hilarious, appealing to all ages, highlighting this movie's family film credentials. And whilst the score is atrocious this is insignificant compared to the magnificence of the story John Hughes is tells.TL;DR A well constructed, emotional movie with wonderfully thought out comedic moments. Whilst the musical arrangement is a shocking reminder of the dark side of the 80's and a tiny minority of the gags fall flat, this film manages to deliver consistently hilarious jokes along with a significant emotional impact.

It achieves that fine combination of both being often hysterically funny while also working well dramatically.Martin is uptight marketing man Neal Page, stubbornly determined to make it from NYC to Chicago in time to celebrate Thanksgiving with his family. But his trouble starts early, especially after he makes the acquaintance of outgoing, amiable chatterbox Del Griffith (Candy), a guy who makes his living selling shower curtain rings. The problems just keep getting worse and worse for Neal; his life becomes Hell, but provides us with some memorable belly laughs.One of the keys to making this work, though, is that Hughes, Martin, and Candy never render these characters as one note but make them real human beings with definite flaws, to be sure, but never people with whom we can't identify. Del is truly one of the best roles (if not *the* best) that the late, great Candy ever had; by the end of the movie he's completely won our sympathies. We are all truly less well off in the wake of his passing.With the exception of Martin's uproarious, F- bomb laden rant at a too-chipper car rental agent (Edie McClurg), nothing here is really R rating level material; for the most part it's good, breezy, easygoing fun. Candy shines in the few dramatic moments the I like me speech, his scene of self appraisal while sitting outside in the car, and his revelation late in the story. The comedic highlights are plenty Martin racing a guy (played by Kevin Bacon in a funny cameo) for a cab in NYC, the fate of the rental car - in fact, the entire highway driving sequence (hilarious sight gags involving skeletons and Satan here!), the confrontation with the car rental agent, the entire hotel bedroom sequence (I still have the How boring are Del's stories? rant memorized almost word for word), and the bus trip. Much of the dialogue is priceless and remains highly quotable. The music is often utterly absurd and thus adding to the comedic value. A fun supporting cast helps, also. Michael McKean is rather wasted as a state trooper, though; he doesn't even get to be funny himself (this role was originally supposed to be bigger). But Dylan Baker (a riot as slovenly redneck Owen, in his first big movie role), Martin Ferrero, Larry Hankin, McClurg, Charles Tyner, and Nicholas Wyman all have entertaining bits, with Troy Evans, Lyman Ward, and William Windom contributing amusing uncredited appearances.The lesson learned - by us as well as Neal - is still resonant, as it's clear one cannot always go by first impressions, or be too quick to form judgments. As Neal himself says at the end, he's become wiser through his experiences.Planes, Trains & Automobiles has to rank as one of Hughes's finest achievements, and repeated viewings don't hinder one's enjoyment. It's simply first rate viewing for this time of year.Nine out of 10.

This film is mainly a story about two strangers coming together despite their quirky differences, with the goal of just getting home as all their travel plans go awry. It's not clever, it's not farcical, it's just real, very real.Steve Martin and John Candy put their comedic talents together to drive each other crazy in Planes. Both are on their way home for Thanksgiving when their flight to Chicago from New York ends up landing in Wichita, Kansas. Martin plays a business man with a sour attitude towards people when things aren't pleasant and Candy plays a loud-mouthed shower curtain ring salesman who has some unusual habits. Naturally the two don't get along and despite their every intention of separating, they find themselves back together, facing a myriad of rough situations. Most of the laughs come from how these two treat each other in addition to the one you have at their misery and expense. The two make a great duo from the moments where they both hate each other to the more sincere ones. The truth is that this plot could happen to any of us (string of bad luck aside) and that's what makes it so likable. We all have to deal with people we can't stand and sometimes in the worst of situations.

The sorts of films I'm referring to are things like the American Pie and Scary Movie series', respectively.Plains, Trains & Automobiles is a no nonsense, out and out farce of a film that constantly remains very, very real and toys with the notion that 'everything that can go wrong, will go wrong.' Where humour is sometimes spawned in other comedies through another characters stupidity, Plains, Trains & Automobiles relies on realistic situations and amusing cause and effect occurrences to put across its content. Some examples of this are in the form of there never being a taxi cab when you need one or having to sit next to an annoying person on a plane.The film is something that I or anyone else can laugh at for its script rather than some of its situations When Neal Page (Martin) is unloading a monologue chock full of a four letter word at an attendant, it's funny; when Del Griffith (Candy) is telling a police man he couldn't tell how fast he was going because the speedometer had melted due to a previous fire, it's funny but when humour is forced due to idiocy, it's not funny and thankfully Plains, Trains & Automobiles doesn't do this that often, in fact the only time it does is when the two characters find themselves hurtling down the wrong way of a motorway and it's down to their own foolishness that Griffith doesn't see two trucks coming at him, Page doesn't realise they're on the left side of the road and Griffith also doesn't deal with a cigarette properly.The one continuous feeling I got when watching the film was that of 'quirkiness'; the characters that inhabit the film are all strange and each have different, almost abnormal, quirk &#150; it must be said they all do except for Page who is funnily enough, the guy whose story we're following. Griffith's quirk is that he's a chatterbox and a little off the wall, the attendant's quirk is that she smiles a lot, Page's boss at the beginning can't make his mind up about some art and amongst all this, Page's goal just seems so much more out of reach because of it all that we feel the frustration and pain with him &#150; it's a very clever method employed by director and writer John Hughes and the bulk of the frustrations are very funny.Despite an awful lot of snow and ice lying around the place, the film has a very warm feel and a sort of 'welcoming' atmosphere that allows you to get lost and caught up in the film; something that works well given the fact it's a road picture so this is something else the film contains atmosphere, with a real sense of heart. What also stuck out was the music; what starts off as a nothing special, nothing awful 80s pop soundtrack quickly seems to develop as the journey intensifies suddenly there is more melody and less lyrical music playing once the friendship develops and the thought of getting home seems closer and more real. This tactic twinned with the 'twist' if you like that comes out of Griffith makes it all the more tragic and yet satisfying in the sense you sort of know a happy ending is just around the corner. There can be no denying that Plains, Trains & Automobiles is a fun, funny and enjoyable trip that uses several film-making aspects to good effect and piles on the entertainment in the form of a great script rather than masses of unfunny 80s slapstick; a good film for all ages.

The second was whilst Neal was on the train thinking back to the bad and then good experiences that him and Del went through - which obviously promoted him to go back for Del. And finally, the last scene where Del arrives home, and his wife and family are their waiting - and he introduces Del ... aah !

"}{"Title":"Steve Martin and John Candy all the way!","Date":"5 February 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Planes, Trains & Automobiles is a hilarious vacation travel comedy from director John Hughes. Starring two outstanding comedians, Steve Martin and John Candy, this entertaining film displays every conceivable nightmare one can encounter while travelling homeward to visit family. Neal Page (Martin) is an adman who plans a simple airplane trip from New York City to Chicago to spend Thanksgiving with his loved ones. He does arrive home, but a little late; along the way, Neal meets a jovial and easygoing blabbermouth named Del Griffith (Candy), who earns his living selling, of all items, shower curtain rings. The obese, witty, and sloppy Del inadvertently takes the slender and polished Neal on a painful cross-country tour he never counted on!Highlights In the busy streets of New York, Neal chases after his cab when Del unknowingly steals it. At the Wichita airport, Ben Stein is perfectly cast as a long-faced flight attendant announcing a cancellation and then smiling. At the hotel room in Wichita, Neal spares no harsh words as he reveals to Del how unwelcome it is to have him as company; when they awaken the next morning, Neal asks Del, Where's your other hand? to which Del replies, Between two pillows, to which Neal exclaims, Those aren't pillows!! While in St. Louis, Neal goes ballistic upon discovering that his assigned rental car is missing; the subsequent dialogue at the rental car agency is understandably inundated with f-words. Neal and Del wind up driving on the wrong side of the highway, smashing their station wagon between two trucks; Del's lit cigarette then ignites the car! The next day, while Neal and Del sing Blue Moon of Kentucky together in their burnt vehicle, a family driving by watches them and presumably figures them to be a couple of hillbillies! Steve Martin cites Planes, Trains & Automobiles as his personal favorite among his own movies, and this is not at all difficult to fathom. In this film, he and John Candy are the whole show; all the other supporting actors appear on screen for maybe a couple minutes at most. It may seem unusual to see Martin as the straight man, but he manages to get away with his share of amusements. Last but not least, Ira Newborn contributed an interesting music score for this film, even if some of the selections were considered awful by film critic Leonard Maltin.

No matter what they do, the obstacles mount and the troubles keep coming. Finally, Martin blows his top at an airport clerk in the film's only real lapse of bad taste which could have been avoided in a family comedy of this sort.But you have to hand it to John Hughes for writing and directing this project which turns out to be a memorable comedy on the plight of travel under stress.STEVE MARTIN projects his own brand of sarcastic humor as the uptight man from Chicago who has a hard time accepting the slob-like behavior of crude JOHN CANDY, but their scenes together ring true and they never become caricatures. They have to carry most of the film and they do so admirably. Candy proves himself to be a very fine actor, limited in the kind of roles he was offered by his overweight appearance and brash temperament.Definitely worth seeing as a reminder of how planes, trains and automobiles can make you go bonkers when things go wrong--especially during the holidays!

Neal has a very hard time coping with Del who is notoriously lax and carefree in contrast with Neal's more controlled and ordered way of life.This is an alright comedy movie with Steve Martin and the late John Candy. As with most John Hughes movies this has a great setup that leaves plenty of opportune moments for comedy. Neal's desperate attempts at getting home on time combined with Del's trying to hard (at friendship) is a very good combination.The actors does a very good job where neither shines alone but together they shine like a big star. The supporting cast's roles is too small to asses accordingly, but the small cameos gives some breathing space for the main cast (Martin And Candy) which would have been needed if they wasn't there.What effects there are, are okay done except when the rental car goes up in smoke, somehow the seats hasn't taken any damage and dosn't leave a spot on Neal and Del's clothes which seem impossible given the state of the car.I give this a 7 out of 10, mainly because I think the main cast is too small and only broken up by small cameos by such favorites as Kevin Bacon and Ben Stein, but it's just a little too little.

Building disaster on disaster, as each phase of the nightmare journey evolves, I was on the floor with laughter. More subtle comic moments such as John Candy's 'piano' playing as they are driving along are terrific and the 'Deliverance' style 'country boy' who gives them a lift in his pick-up is another great moment. And Kevin Bacon has a cameo at the beginning in the taxi race! The film slides into sentimentality towards the end, but I think it gets away with it just about.

They get stuck together during their return trip to CHicago from New York. Their moments together shows their comic genius. The scene in the bed where they end up is quite classically funny without overdoing it like today's comedies. The bonding of these two men's characters show John Hughes who has a gift for telling stories better than most writers and directors today. The two men want to get home for Thanksgiving Dinner and everything that can go wrong does happen which is why they are together in the first place. It's not my favorite film of John Hughes because I think it's kind of sad and you will find out in the end but it's worth watching again and again to get the comic pairing of Martin and Candy. JOhn Candy was one of John Hughes' favorite actors and he used him regularly in his films. John and Steve will leave you wanting more comedy than drama in this film and that's why I gave it an eight instead of a ten but it's still a tender story of friendship between two men.

Well, no matter how many films concerning Thankgiving there may be this certainly wouldn't fall in the traditional Thanksgiving category. This is a funny, fast-paced adventure film where Steve Martin is trying to get home for Thanksgiving by whatever means possible and along for the journey is John Candy. Michael McKean and Kevin Bacon co-star. A great cast and lot's of great music in th soundtrack too. This is from the creative yet uneven mind of director/writer.producer John Hughes. Hughes was one of the more prolific writers for film in the 80's and 90's as well as a producer and sometimes director. Here he has all three roles. He only directed eight films in his career and following the success of Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, Weird Science and Ferris Buellers Day Off this is his fifth in the string of imaginative hits. He had been a writer for National Lampoon Magazine in the 70's before getting into films. He had several cottage industry productions that he wrote including the Home Alone series, The National Lampoon Vaction series and the Beethovan series as well as many other films but his large body of work was hit and miss. Some were very bright and comedic and others were average to awful. He hasn't directed a film since 1991 and his writing and producing tapered off in the 2000's and it appears for now he is out of the film industry at only 56 years old. Cinematographer Donald Peterman who did such film's as Flashdance, Splash, Cocoon, Star Trek IV, Get Shorty and Men in Black photographed this film. This is a funny film and I would give it a 8.5 out of 10. Martin and Candy should have made more films together. Hughes should have directed more films geared to adults.

But, who would have figured out that Steve Martin as the straight man could have been so hilariously funny? This is, without a doubt, the funniest movie I have ever seen.

What happens outside the airport as Neil Page is hailing a taxi is funny too. Although I live in Kansas, I thought the characterization of Kansans was a little unfair, although I found much humor in that, too. I know others won't find as much humor in this as I did, but I found the scenes crisp, the music selections chosen for each scene crisp, and this is bar none, just an absolutely funny movie.

The wonderful thing about this movie is, that you discover new interesting and funny stuff every time you watch it. On the other hand you can laugh about the same scenes again and again. My favorites are the taxi scene when they drive to Braidwood Inn, (Neal Where the hell is the motel? / DEL Is it much further Doobie? /.../ taxi driver on the interstate you see nothing but the interstate / Neal It's the middle of the night / Del I know.He's proud of his town, that's a damn rare thing these days..) certainly the rental car scene (I want a f.....g car right f.....g now!!) and the highway scene (You're going the wrong way!!!)

The actors are fantastic; they interact so well with each other that at times it really seems like they get on each other's nerves as much as is portrayed throughout the movie. 		`Planes, Trains, and Automobiles' is about a corporate father, Neal Page (Steve Martin) returning home from New York to Chicago for Thanksgiving with his family.  Mishaps arise, like not being able to find a cab, getting laid over in Kansas, and not being able to rent a car just to name a few, throughout his quest home.  Along the way he meets up with a shower-curtain-hanger salesman, Del Griffith (John Candy).  At first the two don't see eye to eye, but as the movie progresses, so does their friendship.  Together the two try to overcome all obstacles and make it home in time for the holiday. 		This was a hilarious movie.  The language was a bit much at times, so I wouldn't recommend this to younger ears, but for those who are mature enough to handle it, this is definitely a must see.  Steve Martin and John Candy are great together; the way they interact with each other is very entertaining.  Not only is this movie sidesplitting funny, but it also portrays a fabulous moral.  In the beginning of `Planes, Trains, and Automobiles,' Steve Martin's character does not tolerate John Candy's character at all, which is on account that the two are extremely different from one another.  As the movie advances, Steve becomes more accepting to John's character even though they are complete opposites.  This moral fits the movie really well, and hopefully the viewers caught it. 		As stated above, I would definitely recommend this movie.  From the great actors, to the extraordinary humor, to the magnificent moral, this is an all around great movie.  On a 10 star scale, I would give `Planes, Trains, and Automobiles' an 8, a must see for teenagers and older.

How about the both of them in a hilarious comedy flick? And, how about having John Hughes create this little gem? Well if you've been anticipating the connection to these components, then pay a little attention. These things really exist, you aren't just dreaming, and `Planes, Trains and Automobiles' is the movie in which all these ingredients are combined.`Planes, Trains and Automobiles' is the work of John Hughes, best known for `Sixteen Candles' and `Ferris Bueller's Day Off'. His quirky humor is at work once again with this script. He does a good job capturing many of the stereotypes and awkward situation familiar with most people. His dialogue is humorous, but does have some deeper underlying tones. This isn't just a comedy; it has a bit of heart to it also. It has some, dare I say, touching moments scattered throughout. Hughes has full control of his vision and his directing suits the script well.However, most of the credit doesn't belong to Hughes. Martin and Candy really deserve the praise. They alone create the comedy in this movie. They have great chemistry and comedic timing. They play very well off of each other. Even when they aren't acting their paring is pretty funny, you can't help but laugh. Martin's humor is dry and witty, while Candy portrays the `big oaf' with his style of heartfelt comedy. Their different types of comedy go very well together, almost like a modern day Abbot and Costello.This movie transcends other comedies by way of the plotline. It does an excellent job of displaying the problems people have in their relationships with others. It pokes fun at the fears and pet peeves of people and their interactions. It also does a good job at pointing out stereotypes. The typical executive trying to get home to his wife and kids for Thanksgiving; the friendly salesman that hinders his plans; and the homophobic fears of the American public. A typical format, but with a surprisingly deep meaning.No ordinary comedy is this. It's as much a psychological study of human behavior as a comedy. Deep meanings and hilarious stereotypes are the basis of this movie. A hilarious piece of cinema from the 80's, with two of the day's greatest comedians. This is a must see comedy for any fan of comedy. Especially fans of the late and great John Candy, where his talents are well displayed. This is not your average mindless comedy. So pay some attention to the little details, and you will be greatly rewarded.Overall grade for `Planes, Trains and Automobiles'  B+  "},{"Title":"badda-bing, badda-boom","Date":"1 December 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  	Planes, Trains and Automobiles Witty, Funny, and Hilarious.  This movie is a great knee-slapper, with its style of humor based of situations and not one-liners this movie had this reviewer amused for an hour and half.  There were a few moments of cringing because of excessive language but the story behind that is more interesting and almost (but not quite) excuses the use. 	 	Planes, Trains and Automobiles uses the type of humor that most people like. (At least that's what this reviewer thinks.)  There's no bada-bing that the viewer is expecting to hear after a particularly corny joke.  In fact most of the humor in this movie is situational and ironic.  Neal Page (Steve Martin) wasn't able to make his plane ride home because of a series of almost ridiculous but realistic events.  At a marketing meeting the `big guy in charge' couldn't make a decision on an ad and it turns out that he wants to reconvene later anyways,  Neil is still able to make his plane but can't find a taxi and gets into a race with another pedestrian (Kevin Bacon) looking for a ride somewhere.  As a viewer you really start to sympathize with Neal, he's just trying to get home but nothing is going right.  At this point in the movie Dell Griffith (John Candy) makes his appearance by `stealing' Neal's taxi.  This is where the two `meet' and they won't part ways for very long.  These two get into a lot of mishaps and just when they think it can't get any worse it does, leaving the viewer guessing what could happen next. 	 	The movie is good clean fun there really isn't a lot of swearing except for one scene.  Neal has gotten a rental car assignment and when he takes the shuttle bus to his vehicle spot number he finds it empty and is forced to walk the `miles' back to the airport.  In the process he gets filthy and tired and is on his last fuse when he has to deal with an air-headed woman who is in charge of renting the cars out; basically, when talking to this woman he drops the `f-bomb' every other word.  The reviewer strongly believes that excessive language in a movie just distracts from what's going on but when the story behind this scene is known it helps out the reasoning behind its use.  Apparently, in the 80's a movie wouldn't be seen unless it was rated R, and to become rated R there are a level of requirements needed.  In this case to meet the language requirement, Steve Martin used the F-word 20-something times.  Doing so met the requirements and made the movie R.  The thing that makes it funny is that the language throughout the rest of the movie really isn't that noticeably bad so it's like a big joke to the people who made this movie.	This reviewer recommends this movie to anyone who likes a good comedy, except for the one scene bad-language it could be recommended for almost any type of person.  There aren't any jokes about certain things that had happened some place or time that you need to know about in order to get it and it's not slap-stick comedy that sometimes can just get to annoying to be bareable.  All&#150;in-all, if Planes, Trains and Automobiles doesn't find you laughing some place then this reviewer doesn't know how else you can find humor.

Along the way however, his luck seems to diminish quickly.  After a long day at the office, a stolen cab ride, weather-crippled flight delays, less-than comfortable train and car rides, Neal finds himself in a bind with Del Griffith (John Candy), shower curtain ring entrepreneur and blabbermouth extraordinaire.  From their unintentional rendezvous at the airport, throughout the rest of the movie, Neal finds out the hard way that life won't be so easy as long as this turkey's around.All of Neal's problems start with him.  He's a boring businessman that for the most part, likes to keep to himself.  He's not a big fan of small talk and is the type of guy that doesn't open up to just anyone.  Page isn't a bitter person, he's just a little too irritable and not exactly the most tolerant chap in the land.  On the other hand, his over-zealous counterpart, Del is the exact opposite.  3 words best describe him Big, loveable, idiot.  His cheerful persona and less-than pleasant foot aroma is enough for everyone to get along with, everyone except Neal of course&#133;Del's consistently positive attitude and pointless rambling is the perfect concoction to push Neal's buttons, sometimes a little too hard.  Del doesn't mean to be obnoxious he's just clumsy.  At times, Candy's bumbling idiotic character became a little irritating, but no worries; Neal's over the top tantrums and Del's countless apologies are more than enough to get a hearty chuckle from any viewer.The ongoing mishaps plaguing the duo keep the laughs rolling in.  Perfectly timed anecdotes, eventful situations, and a diverse array of characters are some of the film's entertainment values.  Even though the conflicts that arise are interesting and somewhat funny, there is such a thing as too much of a good thing.  It seemed as if the writers felt that the more trouble the two eggheads got into, the funnier it would be, which at a point, they're right, but a lot of the situations were unrealistic, off-the-wall, and sometimes annoying.   One may complain about the language used in this film.  Not to give too much away, but in one particular scene, the F-Bomb was released by Steve Martin's character a little more than once&#133;try in between every other word.  This ear-crippling display of holiday-season frustration was a little over the top and a tad bit disturbing, but funny.  No one can deny that the on-screen presence of John Candy and Steve Martin definitely adds a comedic element to this holiday flick.  The chemistry between the two is a perfect fit. Their characters' contrasting personalities provide more than enough room for humor and a wonderful display of visual idiocy for the audience to enjoy.  You could really see the two feeding off of each other's energy on the screen.  When you've got Martin's witty sarcastic comments, mixed in with Candy's goofball antics and John Hughes, who has written and directed such movies as The Breakfast Club, Ferris Buellers' Day Off, & Home Alone I-III, you've got cinematic gold!As for the ending of the movie, it was very predictable and somewhat a tearjerker, if you're the sensitive type.  At the very end a shocking secret is revealed, but this reviewer doesn't like to give anything away&#133;that's why this movie's spoiler is written in small print (-- --- -- ---- -- - ---) This film is highly recommended for any Steve Martin and/or John Candy fans, it's not exactly their best work, but it's well worth the hour and a half of your day and for all the ladies out there/everyone else related to him six degrees or less, there's a Kevin Bacon cameo in this flick.  Ooh la la!This reviewer gives this movie a B+.

I guess you just never realize how much Steve Martin and John Candy make good partners. The movie is just plan fantastic it has funny, sad and even angry moments, but most of all funny. During the movie Neal Page and Del Griffith try to make their way home for thanksgiving. Though they have to deal with plane delays, and just all around transportation and lodging problems. No matter how many times Neal try's to escape Del it seems as if they are destined to be traveling partners. But little does Del know that Neal has an extremely short temper when it comes to Del's way of doing things. What really surprises me is that Del had a pretty free ride in the beginning because Neal payed for the taxi, and hotel, and train tickets, and some other things that came along the way. Del tries to pay him back with paying for dinner and other things, but then when Neal tells Del they should go their separate ways Del is pretty upset, so he takes off. Though Neal and Del have gone their own ways they still manage to come together once again. This movie is very funny, you will most likely enjoy the not so lucky experiences that Neal and Del encounter but most of them turn out all right. I do not believe that this would have been as funny as it was without the duo Martin and Candy, im not sure if they have ever played in another movie with each other but planes, trains, and automobiles will be a movie that I would watch more then once a year.

And what makes it a good movies the comedy. For example; at the beginning when Steve Martin engages in a foot race with another pedestrian for a taxi cab. Or when he pays another man for a taxi, and calls him a thieve, and the man responds by saying  close, I'm a layer . Another good part occurred after the Steve Martin and John Candy characters hook up when they are riding in this taxicab that really an old roadrunner. It was painted bright red with twinkle lights in the windows and a little devil doll on the dash. The driver had a very funky grin and shifty eyes. It has to be seen to be understood. Some time after that there is this red neck dude, a friend of the John Candy character that comes to give them a ride. Well this red neck drives a pick up. So the Steve Martin and John Candy characters have no choice but to ride in the back with a very angry dog. Forty miles later Steve Martin, John Candy, and the dog are all pop sickles.	Though this movie does have its bad parts. For example; when the Steve Martin character cusses out the clerk at the car rental desk that was excessive. Now the reason why he said this word so many times is because the film industry has standards for rating a movie. There has to be a certain number of explicet words in a movie. At the time of this movies release the only movies that would sell in the theaters were the ones rated R. But this movie gets a rating of ten (which is a good thing).

It definitely falls under the category of comedy.  It keeps the audience constantly laughing and the viewer will never doze off or stop paying attention.  It's one of those movies where after having seen it once, anyone would look forward to seeing it again. The movie is somewhat unbelievable but it doesn't matter because the fact that it is just makes the whole movie even better.The movie stars Steve Martin as Neal Page and John Candy as Del Griffith.  Those two together are great!! They are both really funny actors, so anyone could imagine how funny they are acting side by side.  Steve Martin has been in many movies and this is one of his greatest.  The same goes with John Candy.  His character has facial hair though, and it just doesn't work for him.  At the beginning of the movie Neal (Martin) comes across as a rude, business man and Del (Candy) comes across as extremely annoying!  But throughout the movie both of them grow and change and the viewer begins to like them more and more.The plot of the movie is basically this Neal (Martin) is trying to get home for Thanksgiving and he runs into Del (Candy) and everything just starts going wrong.  So many bad things happen to the two of them that it starts to become unbelievable.  But, hey it's meant to be a comedy and bad luck does result in laughter.Del rents a rental car and Neal ends up traveling with him in it.  Right after they set off in the car the camera focuses on the side of the car and moves all down it from the front to the end.  It gives the viewer a good look at what the car looks like when Del and Neal first use it.  Well, then some crazy things happen to them and to the car and it gets ruined.  After all that the camera does the exact same thing with the car and the viewer gets to see what it looks like once they have had it for a while.  It's like a before and after picture of the car.  That was very creative and interesting.  It added a nice touch to the film.The music was mostly all background music and it was awesome!  It was 80's music without any words (except at the end of the movie) and it resembled techno music a little too.  It's the kind of music that would make anyone want to get up and dance!  There was one scene with Del and Neal in the rental car where Del turns on the radio and starts singing to it.  That's about the only scene where the music isn't in the background. Overall, Planes, Trains, and Automobiles is a very good movie and it should definitely be watched by many, many people!

Sure, there are various glimpses of others, including Steve Martin's Hallmark-commercial family, an amusingly pedantic supervisor, and a Kevin Bacon cameo, but the movie is intensely focused on Steve Martin's and John Candy's characters.The basic premise is all too familiar  Neal Page (Steve Martin) is trying to get home in time for Thanksgiving dinner.  Yet of course, his cab is stolen at the last second and he misses his flight.  Through  various moments of incredibly bad luck, including flight delays, train breakdowns and more, Neal fights an uphill battle to get home.  With him is Del Griffith (John Candy), an outgoing, quirky shower curtain ring salesman written purely to push Neal to his very limits of frustration.  The movie less about turkey and relatives and focuses solely on the relationship between these two characters Page is a rather dull, distant businessman.  He is the kind of man reveals few of his thoughts, outwardly polite while hiding his pure contemptuousness.  He's not really an uncaring person, but he's irritable and lacks tolerance.  Meanwhile, Del is possesses big, cheerful laughs and equally immense body odor, with a persistently positive attitude who manages to be both endlessly irritating and endearing. The movie is a rather typical buddy road-trip film, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  It is very light-hearted, strolling happily from one misadventure to the next.  It possesses very precise comedic timing, and definitely has a few moments sure to find big laughs, which I will not divulge here.  The gags range from cringe-inducing slapstick to homophobic tension to insane freak accidents.  However, not all are funny - after a certain point, the jokes seem rather tiring and extraneous - especially when the movie veers from its main themes and indulges in rather random, pointless events.  I am at a bit of a loss as to why the screenwriter(s) seems to think that the bigger the obstacle is, the funnier the gag.  The best moments of pure comic style are the more reserved, realistic scenes toward the beginning.  Later on, the movie goes all-out with unnecessary crazy stunts and oddball antics.The movie's predictable ending is incredibly sappy - I almost expected Steve Martin to step out and address the audience with a `moral-of-the-story' voiceover.  There is also a rather annoying scene where Neal reminds the audience of all the crazy things that have happened in the movie with quick shots of previous scenes matched to Steve Martin's `ah, good times' facial expressions.  However, at least I must admit that it is a rather natural story arc for his character, not simply tacked-on as might be the case in a lesser movie.`Planes, Trains and Automobiles' is a essentially an entertaining way to spend an hour or two.   As long as the viewer doesn't expect a brilliantly hilarious or deeply moving movie, some great fun can be had.  For that, this movie deserves a C+.

Steve Martin's style of humor is very amusing. He builds up a sort of anticipation. Just like in the beginning of the movie where his character Neal Page is racing Kevin Bacon to a cab. He looks at the cab, then to Kevin Bacon's character and then back to the cab. This lets the viewer know that something going to happen.  From the very beginning of the movie, the viewer can tell that Neal Page isn't going to have a very good trip home for Thanksgiving. He loses 75 dollars trying to buy a cab ride from an attorney, only to have the cab drive away with a different man in it, but sees the trunk that the man traveling with. The man in the cab is John Candy's character, Del Griffith.	After learning that his flight was delayed because of a storm, Neal sees the same trunk that was with the man in the cab. He looks up and sees Del Griffith. Their journey together really begins here. Their flight gets canceled all together, so they must find somewhere to stay overnight. Neal can't find somewhere to stay, so Del offers Neal to come with him to the hotel where he is staying at. They go to the hotel and must stay in the same room together with only one bed. Talk about an awkward moment. This is when the two start to argue and fight. But they still travel together even though Neal detests being around Del. 	The two run into many obstacles, from being robbed to their train breaking down. Somehow the viewers learn to love John Candy's character and can see the chemistry that Candy and Martin have when they're acting together. This is one thing that makes the movie what it is. The actors show real emotion. When John Candy is sad or if Martin's character is furious, the viewer believes it. There are other things that make this movie wonderful, but the acting is the most important. To have a great movie, the actors have to have some sort of chemistry. If the actors have that chemistry, the special effects won't make too much of a difference. 	By the time the two reach their destination, Neal softens up a little bit towards Del. As Neal leaves the train station, `Every time you go away' performed by Blue Room comes on, adding to the sadness of the moment, but also brings some humor to it.  On his way to his home, he puts two and two together and realizes that Del really has no home at all. Neal goes back to the train station to find Del still there. Neal invites Del over for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone is happy and the viewers learn that Neal really has some kindness in him.

Del ended up getting the cab and, with a layover at the airport, they reunite when they discover they were both trying to catch the same flight.

When they show up at the motel, there's only one room left, so they ended up having to share.      This comedic drama is carried on throughout the movie, while this odd couple tries to find a way back home before Thanksgiving dinner.Planes, Trains and Automobiles was overall a great comedy that had good humor and just the right amount of comical tension/build up to make the movie extremely enjoyable.      The rating for this movie is R, signifying that this movie may not be appropriate for audiences under the age of 17, which is, infact, true in this case.      One of the only inappropriate aspects, but a large one, is the language. If you take offence to crude language, this movie isn't for you. Even though the language is mainly in one scene, the scene uses extreme words repeatedly as an exaggeration and portrayal of how frustrating traveling can be, especially on the holidays.      If this is you, you may not feel that this movie is as enjoyable as others. But, for those of you that don't take offense to things such as language, this is a thoroughly entertaining film that's good fun for holiday, or anytime, watching.      Planes, Trains and Automobiles is a comic relief that many can relate to with all the holiday chaos and frustration.

Sure this dark comedy may be a little hard to watch with bad things happen to good people, but this isn't REALLY that bad.

The characters feel like ''real'' people.  The situations remind us of things that happened to us&#133;  Not much ''reality television'' is worth watching, this is.  Real things that real people do, and real results happen.  Most of us have been in Neal or Del's situation.Travelers of all ages and experiences can appreciate the humor.  (Although I say ''all ages'', please note this movie contains FOUL LANGUAGE and is rated ''R'' by the MPAA.  Actually, almost all of the ''foul language'' occurs in one scene.)  With everything this movie puts its audience through, it contains a heart-warming ending that makes it all worth it.I'll end this review with a great quote ''With all the trouble I've had on this trip.

These two comedians work so well together.  Steve Martin plays uptight businessman Neil Page, trying to get home for the holidays.  His location is New York and his destination is outside of Chicago.  He meets a fellow traveler, Del Griffith played by John Candy.  Griffith is the opposite of Page.  He is a laid back fun loving goof ball that has many connections because of his job as a shower curtain salesman.  Weather and Del's happy go lucky manner keep Neil from getting home to Chicago.  The two leads in other movies tend to suffer from being too silly but in this movie they are perfect.  Candy is just the right amount of silly, while Martin comes across as a perfectly classy comedian.The writing in this movie is excellent.  The lines are funny the plot is well developed and this movie overall is excellent to watch.  The score is also very good the 80's music is perfect for this.  Also watch for Kevin Bacon in a small part where he doesn't even talk.  Michael McKean is also in a small part.  There are so many classic moments in this movie, first the bed scene (THOSE AREN'T PILLOWS), but the greatest part is the scene with Mrs. Poole, that is hilarious, so much profanity, you can't help but love it.  The movie is not only good because it is funny it is also good because it is somewhat touching.  These two show a very human side that might touch you a little bit.  Since I have seen this movie I have not looked at shower curtains the same way.  These two people have a natural chemistry together that compliment each other very well.  Candy always goes too far and Martin always pulls him back.  The movie is good because while it over exaggerates a little all of us that travel have had these bad experiences where nothing seems to go right. Also it must be noted that John Candy has been in a lot of John Hughes' movies, such as vacation and Home Alone, but this was his only lead role in one of his films.  This is also a movie set a bit in Chicago, and this is the exact same house they have in the movie Home Alone, and a few other movies Hughes directed.  Hughes is a very good movie- maker and this is one of his crowning achievements.  This is also one of the best roles for Martin and Candy they have rarely been better.This is one of the best comedies I have seen.  It is just an excellent movie.  For a few years my dad would not let me see this movie because of the scene with Mrs. Poole, but I did watch it when I was eight years old.  I thought it was funny then.  I did not watch it all the way through for over ten years, and it was still hilarious.  It is too bad these two couldn't do another movie together they were perfect together.  Long live John Candy, a man who will always be with us through his comedy.

This may be the case with, Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, a simple premised yet convoluted story of a man trying to get home to his family for the Thanksgiving holidays. Planes takes the viewer on the road with ad exec, Neal Page, (Steve Martin) as he gets stuck in Wichita, Kansas, en route to Chicago from New York, because of bad weather and airline delays, while making every effort to get home for turkey dinner.  Adding to Neal's travails is new-found cling-on acquaintance, Del Griffth, a somewhat pushy, overbearing (but in the end sensitive and lovable) oaf, played effortlessly and with stylish eloquence by John Candy. There's plenty of side-splitting physical comedy mixed poignantly with sentimental feelings that, from time to time, pluck implacably at the heart-strings, as Mr. Hughes hits home with Planes, a pleasant and successful example of Capra-esque storytelling.As the characters, ever so slowly, get closer to their destination, it just inexorably seems further away; but the laughs don't let up.  And in the end, with Paul Young's, Every Time You Go Away laid over feel-good images of family and love, John Candy's character, Dell, says it all with with his misty-eyed, freeze-framed smile we are lucky to love, and be loved...don't forget that, but savor it.

It is an absolutely wonderful movie. Yes, it is regarded as a comedy but when I think of it I think of it as more of a drama. John Candy gives the performance of his too short career as the traveling shower curtain ring salesman Del Griffith. What makes Candy's performance so impressive is that while Del is an obnoxious, annoying slob, Candy shows that this is a very lonely, sweet, kind, and caring man with a great heart. This is a man who is putting his needs behind the needs of another person, a complete stranger in Neil Page. Candy creates an incredibly complex man, who the audience really gets to know and geniunely care about. They say comedies are the hardest films to get nominated for oscars, which is true. And while PT & A is no Best Picture winner, it certainly in my mind has a performance not just worthy of a nomination but of an oscar as well. It would be interesting to see how Candy's performance would be regarded if the film came out today.I will admit this, I have seen most of the tear jerker films (Terms of Endearment, Steel Magnolias, Brian's Song, etc.) but this is the only movie to make me cry. That ending, whew!, it's a rough one. And again, despite all the wonderful comedy in this film, whenever I think of PT & A I think of the wonderful character of Del Griffith and the powerful ending.

(Possible spoilers)","Date":"19 April 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  It's not often I see a movie I really love, and much less so a comedy, so this is one I really value and really want to recommend.Set a few days before Thanksgiving, Planes, Trains and Automobiles follows Steve Martin's uptight city worker and John Candy's laid-back shower-curtain-ring salesman as they struggle to get home for the holidays.  But to see this as just a road movie, or as another take on The Odd Couple is to miss its uniqueness.  What we have here is a near-perfect comedy, one that has characters you actually care about, characters who grow through the movie, and a depth that is rare among its peers.It's just so consistently, relentlessly funny, and so varied in its humour; sight gags follow one-liners, which follow absurd moments, which follow closely-observed character stuff.  Writer/director John Hughes was really at his absolute peak, writing more great jokes for this film than for all his others combined.  His teen movies don't interest me, and since this film he's mostly sucked, with a few Home Alone movies and some lame remakes filling out his résumé, but God bless him for this!  There're so many quotable lines that I nicked most of them and used them to pass myself off as funny before I discovered the joys of self-made-sarcasm.  It's an absolute gem, I wish it was held in higher regard.Steve Martin and John Candy make a great double-act, and it's a shame they didn't work together more.  There's a real warmth between them, and their initial irritation and then growing fondness for each other is touching and genuine.  Steve Martin is probably at his peak, with this performance sandwiched between his earlier, offbeat movies and his later, often duller work, and John Candy is at his most loveable.  It always makes me sad to watch the movie because his character has so much hidden unhappiness, and the final, lingering shot on his smile is painful to watch now.The ending always gets me, and elevates the film further.  Until then it's just hilarious; in the closing minutes it becomes touching and deep and real.  And it always gets me angry, too, because John Candy was so undervalued and so underused.  He made too many forgettable movies, either because he had bad taste in scripts or because he wasn't offered the quality he deserved.  He should be remembered as one of the greats.  His timing is superb, and his charm is exceptional.  He's so funny here, in so many ways, and so loveable.  He was such a talented, under-rated comic actor, and I'm glad he starred in at least this one perfect movie.Whether you like John Hughes's work or not, you simply have to see Planes, Trains and Automobiles, if only to understand why the line `Those aren't pillows' is an absolute classic!

There is a good story, which includes the chemistry between Neal and Del.Yes, this is R-rated, but it's probably gonna be the most harmless R-rated movie you're gonna see. It may have the same rating as Saw and Hostel, but the most inappropriate things are the f-bombs and the mild sexual references.

He was all about being the genuine softy, but man, how it worked in all the movie's he did. Planes, Trains, and Automobiles of course, is no different, and is one of the strongest examples of Candy's excellence and unused potential as an actor. Him and Martin play as a great duo of two guys just trying to make it home for the holidays. And what makes it difficult is that their personalities are poles apart (at least upon the surface).The scene at the Bravewood Inn is memorable and haunting of how good of an actor Candy was and how amazing he still could have been. For Martin too though, it is well played and perfectly acted giving us the straight-anal man, Neil Page. The greatest quality to this film is the fact that Hughes, Martin, and Candy were able to blend that of comedy and drama together flawlessly.All-in-all, there are too many great parts to this film. The acting, the writing, the cheesy 80's electronic soundtrack, all contribute to the masterpiece which is easily Hughes' greatest work. Even the delivery of lines from the great Michael McKean is top-notch, but I digress... Here I write that Planes, Trains & Automobiles is my idea of everything Candy could have given us. It is simply a masterpiece for it's (now) 'time-capsule' effect on two legendary comedians and the genius of a writer/director who brought us some of the most memorable films of the 80's.10/10 "},{"Title":"...look around once in a while, or you could miss it...","Date":"16 November 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" sometimes all you need is 3 talents in one place and the results of it can be just awesome.This is one of those movies which blown me away from the first minutes of it.It was made in 1986/1987,same years i was made ) So maybe i cant fully understand atmosphere and time of it,but truly John Hughes (1950-2009) made me to feel it ...I think every filmmaker would be proud that even after 23 years watchers is able to read message director is sending.

He unwillingly hooks up with Del Griffith, a big-hearted but overbearing fellow traveller, and together they have a two-day cross-country odyssey of argument, misadventure and self-discovery.Zestfully written, produced and directed by Hughes, Hollywood's golden-boy of eighties comedy-drama, this is a terrific little picture, and my favourite of his films. He wisely stands back and simply lets his two talented leads do their thing, both creating memorable and hilariously well-observed characters. Candy in particular is absolutely outstanding in this film; like so many comic actors his performance seems invisible - he's just a funny guy - its only when he plays it straight in a couple of scenes that you realise just how much talent, technique and artistry goes into what he's doing. It's classic proof of the old Edmund Gwenn quote, Dying is easy - comedy is difficult.. The movie is essentially an extended skit of these two rubbing each other up the wrong way, but it's packed full of side-slapping moments; my favourite is their reaction when they wake up one morning and find they've been snuggling into each other. The support cast has some great offbeat players in bit parts, there are plenty of goofy wintry locations (it was shot around Illinois) and there's a wacky casio-keyboard score by Ira Newborn which bounces it along. This does what the best comedy movies do - it holds up a big mirror and says which of these guys are you like ? The answer is we're all like Neal - selfish, impatient, uptight and reserved - when we'd really like to be like Del - friendly, funny and generous. The last shot of Candy's smile sums up the film and this great Canadian actor, who brightened dozens of movies and died way before his time.

We have all been Neil Paige, just wanting to get home to a warm bed, a beautiful family and the comforts of home.As surely as we all know that feeling, we also know the pangs that Del Griffith copes with in his semi-annoying way, as he copes alone in the world, clinging to the lost love of his life, and trying to make his way in a cynical world.The emotional attachments the viewer develops by film's end for Del Griffith are made deeper by a performance by John Candy that is worthy of high praise. John Candy was in his element, playing a broad range of comical and dramatic moments. How many red-blooded men can honestly say they don't relate to the did you see that Bears game moment? The film is an honest reflection of how people, given a chance, can still care for each other, even when the going is tough.This was by far John Candy's best and most memorable role, and it was also one of Steve Martin's breakthrough roles, as he showed a true talent as a semi-serious dramatic actor.In the end, Neil Paige gets home, and Del Griffith's melancholy smile is the perfect still-shot ending.

It really doesn't matter, however, because with a few rewrites, this film could have easily been set at the end of December.But let's not argue semantics. This is a hilarious movie, and it works almost exclusively because of the comic skills and chemistry between its two stars, Steve Martin and the late John Candy. Both are skilled comedians, and more importantly, they are both terrific actors. It is so rare to find a person of the latter. Usually, it's the actor play the same version of themselves only spouting different lines. Martin and Candy actually create living, breathing characters.Neil Page (Steve Martin) is a tightly-wound marketing executive working in New York City while his family lives in Chicago (how this works isn't explained, but never mind). He is desperately trying to get home for Thanksgiving, but he's about to have a serious run-in with Murphy's Law. Even worse is the fact that time and time again he's saddled with Del Griffith (John Candy), an overly friendly and chatty shower ring salesman.Martin and Candy are perfectly cast. Martin is no stranger to playing a jerk, and that serves him well here. He has a heart, and tries to let Del down easy (sometimes), but more often than not, Del's attempts to help Neil get home get him closer to wringing the big guy's pudgy neck. John Candy should have gotten an Oscar nomination as Del. Not only is he hilarious, but he's also completely irresistible. No matter how bad his plans backfire, it is impossible not to like the guy. He's relentlessly optimistic, but it hides a deep sense of hurt and pain.During the 80's and mid 90's there were few filmmakers bigger than John Hughes. Hughes has crafted a masterwork here because the funny moments are exaggerated so slightly, which keeps much more of the element of truth in the humor. The result is a movie that is probably as funny as the material warrants it to be.My rating Rated PG-13 for language.

There is an extreme overabundance of bad music, and when watching this, even in the best of scenes, I wanted to turn the volume down so the music would stop. In moderation, this type of music would have been fine, but this was too much! The only other negatives...well there aren't too many. This is predictable, but that's alright. It isn't the funniest movie out there, but it provides enough laughs to make for an entertaining viewing and a good time.Planes, Trains and Automobiles has been touted by many as a classic. I would not place it as a classic, by any means, but it's a fine R-rated family comedy (what an oxymoron!, with quite a bit of heart.My rating *** out of ****. 90 mins. R for language.

Though this movie, `Plains, Trains and Automobiles' was very funny, it seems to follow a formula that Steve Martin uses in a lot of his movies.  The movie opens with Neil Page (Steve Martin) sitting in a meeting that will just not end.  Neil's looking at his watch and looking at his plane ticket and Neil needs to go now so he can make it home in time for Thanksgiving with his family.  Neil races to catch taxis and Airplanes, but it seems as if the whole world is turned against him.  And in the midst of all his bad luck he meets an annoying Del Griffith (John Candy) who makes everything worse for Neil. 		The movie starts out a little funny and a little slow as it follows the business man Neil with everything in his life in order.  But it starts to gain momentum as more things go wrong for Neil, and you feel annoyed and a little bad for him, and the more things that happen to him, the funnier the movie gets.  Steve Martin made me feel annoyed, which is a good thing in this case.  He was so believable in his character of Neil Page that I was feeling all of his feelings right along with him.  If I ever had to share a hotel bed with Del Griffith I would take a shower for days, and I would scrub my skin clean until it bled.  John Candy was so convincingly gross and annoying that when John and Steve woke up in the hotel bed together and said, `Del, where's your other hand at?' 	`It's in between these two pillows.'  Del said. 	`Those aren't pillows....!' Neil said `Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!' 	The whole audience was rip roaring with screams and with laughter.  John and Steve bounced joke after joke off of each other.  The chemistry needed for a good comedy to work was definitely there between the two actors.  Each one has there own comedy style that they usually use in their own movies, and their styles came together in scenes like the hotel to make everyone laugh out loud. 		 Another thing that made people laugh was the cheap and corny 80's music that stood out in the movie like a sore thumb.  It was the type of music that you look back on years later, and are embarrassed to say that you used to listen to it.  The music didn't contribute to the film in any positive way.  It just took away from the mood that the director was trying to portray, because it was noticeably bad and didn't seem to fit the movie in any way.	I was searching pretty hard for something wrong with `Planes, Trains and Automobiles', and a few seconds of bad music was all that I could come up with.  Other then that, I laughed really hard at this movie.  And when it comes down to it, whether or not the audience laughs is all that really matters in a comedy.  That's why I gave this movie the grade of a B+ and I recommend anyone who's looking for a laugh to watch `Planes, Trains and Automobiles'.

Steve Martin playing Neal Paige and John Candy as Del Griffith have great chemistry on the screen and it shows. The story places the characters in a struggling situation with getting home for Thanksgiving while dealing with themselves, each other, and transportation.     Del Griffith and Neal Paige inadvertently meet each other while trying to catch a cab in a busy New York traffic scene. Del ends up getting the cab and Neal is left to find another ride during rush hour. After the mishap they end up meeting once again in the airport and find out they are on the same flight. The flight is laid over and finally cancelled so Neal is left to rent a car. He later finds out the rental car is not in the lot and throws a fit with the rental car clerk. If you're not a fan of profane language, this would be the part to fast forward through. And as he rightfully deserves, he is met by the front of Del Griffith's tire. The both of them decide to get a place to stay but are left with one room and are forced to stay in one bed together. This in itself is one of the funniest parts in the movie.     One thing with this movie was the drama never ended really keeping you on your seat even if you didn't even like the movie you still wanted to see what happened next. Steve Martin delivers a great performance, sometimes going overboard but that is not anything new when it comes to Steve Martin. John Candy is great as always, really bring life into the character and keeps you guessing.  This is an enjoyable movie with everything you would expect out of a Steve Martin comedy. It would not be recommended for the family because of the some very fragrant vocabulary used repeatedly, and also the obvious `R' rating. If you're one who likes to laugh at the expense of others this is the movie for you.      I give it 6 out of 10 because the movie was enjoyable. You have to love John Candy and Steve Martin but I was disappointed because previous to this movie I have never heard so many F-bombs in one sentence. I didn't leave a very good impression.

Basically advertising executive Neal Page (Steve Martin) is easily frustrated, and all he wants is to get home for Thanksgiving with his wife Susan (Laila Robins) and kids. When his plane is cancelled due to bad weather, he decides to try every other transport to get home. As well as the bad luck travelling, he is blessed with the presence of shower curtain salesman Del Griffith (John Candy), never short of advice, conversation, bad jokes or company. Of course he is not the perfect travel companion, and Neal of course has to suffer or complain (for a while) with his slob habits. They both seem to be going the same direction, and they do slowly get to like each other as they are reunited in the different transport types. Of course there is the tiniest bit of sentimentality, and it was quite predictable that Neal would invite homeless Del round for Thanksgiving dinner, a very pleasant film. Also starring This Is Spinal Tap's Michael McKean as State Trooper, Kevin Bacon as Taxi Racer, Happiness's Dylan Baker as Owen, Carol Bruce as Joy Page, Olivia Burnette as Marti Page, Diana Douglas as Peg, Jurassic Park's Martin Ferrero as Second Motel Clerk, Friends' Larry Hankin as Doobie, Mrs. Doubtfire's Matthew Lawrence as Little Neal Page and The Mask's Ben Stein as Wichita Airport Representative. Martin and Candy are both fantastic, the little-and-large combination makes for good slapstick, it is just a good comedy film. My favourite moment is Martin constantly saying the F word to the car rental desk woman. It was number 33 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Good!

While funny, and at times sarcastic, the movie portrays two middle-aged men just tried to get home.  While the richer, more refined gentleman, Neal Page, waltzes into fiascos one after the other, he repeatedly runs into the center of his problems.  Played by none other than John Candy, Neal's ignorant nemesis provides corny jokes and impossible circumstances.  The holiday of Thanksgiving is nearly missed by Neal Page, not only when he had lost a taxi, but when the next one he saw got stolen!  Not to mention horrible motels, and showerheads that all of a sudden stop, he also gets stuck with that same man in such a repetitive sense.  Sympathy for this man goes up notches while continuous troubles find it hard to watch.  Squinting at the film, the viewer can't help but feel stupid for watching it. The worth of the film cannot be judged in the scenes preceding the end of the movie.  Unexpectedly there's a kind of hope for the gentleness of humankind, when not only have such trials been dealt with, but the ability to reform and truly care gives a sign of humanity.  In Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, there's not just comedy, short slapstick humor that most get sick of, there's also fundamental attacks and congratulations to the attitude of human beings in general.  Not the most wonderful movie in the entire world, Planes, Trains, and Automobiles should be seen by those who simply love Steve Martin; and know, or want to know, his hilarity.  On a scale of one to ten (ten being the highest) this movie rates a seven.

Somehow they end up traveling together and the plot unfolds into half-funny comedy by John Hughes.After seeing the flick I was surprised about the flick being an R rating, with the exception to one scene. I believe it was do to the target audience at the time. The comedic aspect of the flick was quite aggressive. By being aggressive I mean it was a bold exaggerated type of comedy.  Also, the jokes were more of an immature type in contrast to a more sophisticated subtle comedy.The plot was kind of dull in a man trying to get home for Thanksgiving. If Steve Martin and John Candy were not in this movie I would view this flick as horrible. Not to mention the story was too straight forward for my liking. Now the acting was pretty good for the flick. A couple famous faces popped up for a short spot like Kevin Bacon, Edie McClurg, and Michael McKean. Steve Martin and John Candy work really well together. Those two basically kept the story alive. Also, under the circumstances of the story they did a good job.I'll be brief on this.

And after rewatching Planes, Trains & Automobiles, Scent of a Woman remains the champion.What am I talking about? How many Thanksgiving movies are there? Are there enough to make top 25 favorite and bottom 10 worse lists? Heck, is there enough to fill a 5-spot list?I digress. I did laugh out loud in this a few times with Planes, Trains & Automobiles. It was funny and definitely touching, especially towards the ending. Also, some of the lines were priceless, such as You know, I was thinking, when we put our heads together&#x85;we've really gotten nowhere. &#x96; Neal.What we have here, is Neal (Steve Martin) trying to get back to his family in Chicago for Thanksgiving, but every obstacle has been thrown in his way, including traveling buddy, the good-natured but dufus Del (John Candy.) They develop a needy relationship by using, obviously, many methods of travel and of course, hilarity ensues.Okay, here's the problem. I've driven from St. Louis to Chicago &#x96; the duo's last leg of their journey. It's just a smidgen above 300 miles. That's not that far! Okay, maybe for Little House on any Prairie-times, but not for those using modern transportation devices, such as, I dunno, planes, trains and/or automobiles. Neal's wife desperately wants him to come home, but I guess the thought of her driving a mere 600 miles round trip is too much for her?But, wait, it gets better! (Or worse?) In one of the comedic scenes, the odd couple manages to set their car on fire next to a sign that reads Chicago 102 miles. (The car is, spoiler &#x96; sorry, salvable and drivable. How? We don't know, but we have to assume they put it out with&#x85;uh&#x85;snow?) First instinct for them is to get yet another run-down motel room. Now that lonely wife can't drive 204 miles roundtrip to be reunited with her loved one.And further (!) they travel some more the next day, get pulled over and have to hitchhike in a semi. John Candy, er, Del, gleefully says it's just under three hours. Let's not even estimate here. Even though they've moved closer to Chicago since that sign that read 102 miles to go, let's just say that's how far they'd have to go. That means, way back in 1987, the highway's speed limit has to be roughly&#x85; 35 mph?Okay. No movie's perfect, but this is quite the major flaw here. We're supposed to sympathize with Neal's wife and Neal, himself, but the old lady's not willing to hop in the car to solve this problem? Oh, I live in the metro-Phoenix, AZ. From one point of the edge of town to the opposite end is just about 96 miles. I would take that journey to get someone home for Thanksgiving, let alone safe.This is not to mention the countless other inconsistencies regarding all the free stuff they got on either their con-artistry or other people's credit cards.Again&#x85;I digress. Skip the plot holes, and enjoy the ride. Although, since we're no longer slave to this buddy-road movie, might I suggest the 10x more hilarious, albeit extremely similar 2010 version of Robert Downey Jr./Zach Galifianakis's Due Date?

Martin is occasionally waspish but he's clearly the guy the viewer is meant to identify with. Almost all the jokes are at the expense of the affable and talkative Candy.First of all, Candy is fat, and the most is made of this when he and Martin are forced to share a space -- adjoining seats on an airplane or a motel bed. Second, Candy is a slob. He smokes, he eats nothing but junk food, he litters his surroundings with trash, he leaves his toiletry junk all over the bathroom. Third, Candy is selfish -- not out of meanness but out of thoughtlessness. He uses all the towels in the bathroom so that when Martin finishes his shower he's left with only a face towel to dry himself.But, for the most part, we're watching a simulacrum of The Out of Towners in which a couple start off with their clothing, property, and self satisfaction intact and wind up with virtually nothing except what's commonly called a learning experience. I won't bother to outline the plot. You could probably do just as good a job guessing what it is. Two strangers meet on an airplane and try to get home to Chicago for the Thanksgiving holiday. The plane lands in Wichita, Kansas. They must take a train. The train grinds to an unplanned halt in the middle of nowhere. They must find a room for the night but the convention is in town or something. A cab. A rented car. A ride in the back of a freezing truck. A complete nightmare.Neil Simon might have done wonders with this script. (And I kept thinking how Chaplin would have handled certain scenes.) But Neil Simon had nothing to do with it and the story doesn't really build. Martin seems fretful from the start, and Candy is obnoxious, taking off his shoes in a crowded space and waving his fetid socks in the air. Until the sappy and uninspired ending, they don't develop in any way. That's not bad in itself. I wouldn't care if they NEVER changed, as long as there were enough laughs built into their enforced togetherness. But as it is, it's mostly boilerplate.Some moments are funny. The two men wake up in the motel bed with Candy half smothering Martin, kissing Martin's ear while thinking of his wife. The two leap out of bed with disgust and go through this faux masculine routine of setting-up exercises and shouted comments about those Bears or some other ball team.There are lamentably few such funny moments. It IS diverting and the kids should get a kick out of it if they don't mind a few curse words, so it's not a perfect failure. I guess the problem with it is that it's so obvious.

The protagonists Neal (Steve Martin) and Del (John Candy) do some incredibly stupid things, and have some very bad things happen to them, while the various crooks have all the fun. For me this just is not the kind of comedy that I enjoy. The dull spots far outweighed the bright spots. Also, I never have enjoyed John Candy, to me he is always an irritant, no matter what his role is.All the rest of my comments contain MAJOR SPOILERS, please read no further if you have not yet seen the movie.It starts 2 days before Thanksgiving, in a very tedious meeting with a client, Neal is trying to make is 6PM flight to O'Hare and get home by 9PM. After buying a cab ride for $75 from a greedy attorney, then losing it anyway to Del, they both get to the airport and both on the same delayed flight, which lands in Wichita because of snowed-in Chicago. That's when the escapade really begins. To try and get to Chicago on time they have to first take a train, and when it becomes disabled, are put on a bus to St Louis, then have to rent a car to Chicago, thus the name of the movie. Nothing works out right, Del is a smoking, annoying blabbermouth who tells anecdotes without a point, and is a constant irritant to Neal. Then, a thief sneaks into their room at night and steals all their cash.In general, I don't enjoy watching movies where the main characters have to endure lots of misery, especially if it is a comedy. Where there is misery, it must be inflicted on what we might consider the bad guys. P,T & A is what I consider a dumb comedy. The various bad guys have the fun (punch in the face, kick in the nuts, steal money, greedy lawyer, dishonest cab driver, snotty stewardess) while the good guys do incredibly stupid things and have all kinds of bad things happen to them. I thought the first 5 minutes, setting up the anticipation of a possibly difficult trip home, and the last 5 minutes, with the family on TG morning, were the best. Filmed in the winter, the main of the movie is too dark, and dirty, both figuratively and literally, for my enjoyment. The scene where Neal gets back to the car rental counter, and berates the lady at the counter, with every other word being the F-word, was the low point of the movie for me, and whatever hopes I had for it to be really entertaining was lost there.But I did like some things! The scene where they woke up cuddling was totally funny. Del, where's your other hand? Del, Between two pillows. Neal, Those aren't pillows. Or, the scene of them driving down the highway in a burned-out car reminded me of the two guys in Dumb and Dumber riding down the highway on that tiny scooter, on their way to Aspen. Or Del's comment, We'd have more luck playing pickup sticks with our butt-cheeks, than we will getting a flight out of here before daybreak. Or the guy who gave them a ride to the train station, about his little wife, She's tougher than she looks. Her first baby came out sideways, she didn't scream or nothing. And, it does have a pleasing ending, when Neal finds out that Del's wife died 8 years ago and he really has no home, so comes home with Neal for Thanksgiving.I realize that Roger Ebert has it among his list of great movies, but it just isn't the type of comedy I enjoy. While I enjoyed many of the jokes, overall the best rating I can give it on a 10-point system is 4. Just too much misery for me to enjoy it as a comedy.

Unfortunately, it's not funny. Steve Martin and John Candy are top-shelf comedy actors, and when either is on screen alone it's easy to see why. Martin does a fuming, put-upon straight man almost as well as he does an oddball man-child in other, better films, and Candy's solo lip-sync is the best part of the movie. But when the two are together and exchanging words, as they usually are, they are less than the sum of their parts. John Hughes was a great writer, but not a great comedy writer. He had a compulsion to write sad, angry, troubled characters, and these don't add depth to a comedy, they make it a bore. Martin's character vents his frustration with Candy's far too early, before we have had a chance to get on his side, and the complaint he fixates on&#x97;that Candy's character tells boring stories&#x97;is not one we have actually seen in action. His explosion is therefore more awkward than funny, and it shifts the focus from the characters' interactions to Martin's inner flaws. Hughes may have thought that was neat dramatic work, and it might well be, but it fails to work as comedy. Meanwhile, Candy's character is too much a puppy dog, and when writing for him Hughes dives repeatedly into the comedy-killing pitfalls of sappiness and sentimentality. A lot of fine comic actors show up for bit parts, and they might have provided some relief from the unrewarding central dynamic, but Hughes fails to provide them with any really good lines. The chuckles come from recognition only Kevin Bacon, Ben Stein, and Michael McKean are each reminders of funnier films. Planes is a mishmash of talent, but it just doesn't work.

Steve Martin is well-cast as the family man who is attempting to get home to his wife and kids for the holidays, sidelined by bad luck as well as by John Candy as a walking jinx. Written and directed by the puerile John Hughes, this one-note tedium may bring forth many sardonic truths for weary travelers (just as Neil Simon's The Out-of-Towners did), yet Hughes has no little devil in him. Burying every nuance of heart underneath a steadfastly smirking veneer, Hughes seems to have nothing but contempt for the working-class, and his staging of these gags is offensive. Martin's double-takes are funny (if not fresh), but Candy is tiresome the minute we meet him. Good-looking production and a snappy pace but--with Hughes at the helm--the returns are mostly meager. *1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"Maudlin and mawkish","Date":"30 August 2006","Score":"11 out of 33 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Just the usual Steve Martin performance of grimacing and throwing knock-kneed shapes, teamed with the Candy's awkward squawking manchild buffoonery. The situations are contrived, deus positively exudes from the machina, and the sentiment is splashed on with a bucket. The tone is uneven, the characterisation is confused and inconsistent, and the premise is uninteresting and trivialised; no single occasion should be make or break for a family, even one inbued with such artificial significance as Thanks For All the Land Day.Avoid, unless you enjoy being battered around the head with clumsy lectures on the joys of loving one's fellow man, a script no doubt penned from inside a gated community, behind a security fence.

To me, there are too many things that just don't ring true for me to enjoy it.There are some funny moments, but a lot of this film just seems way too contrived.  The basic premise is that everything goes wrong.  That's it, really.  There is no way all of these things would happen.Now, I know sometimes films stretch reality.  But this movie tries to have its cake and eat it too--a completely unrealistic plot combined with an attempt to comment on the human condition.  And to me, at least, it feels phony.I also have a problem with the actions of each major character.  Steve Martin would realistically ditch John Candy the first chance he got.  The way the film keeps them together is completely forced.  And we're also supposed to believe that the Candy character's motivation is to help Martin get home--never mind the fact that the guy obviously dislikes him and wishes he would go away.All in all, it's too unrealistic to be poignant and too contrived to be hilarious.

Along comes Candy's character to add to the already poor situation as they are over booked with the airline, and over fly their destination due to weather. Spending time on the road together they are enemies, destined to become friends.  You have to forget that airlines are obligated to get their passengers to their destination as are passenger railways and interstate bus lines, plus a lot of other common sense items and this might almost be a funny movie to watch.

This is yet another one of those schizoid movies that can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy or a feel-good buddy movie and, as most often happens in such cases, flops at both (see Grumpy Old Men). The pathetically sappy ending is an exercise in maudlin sentimentality. What humor there is is sophomoric and strained (one can always get laughs from the junior high set by stringing the f-word together to excess in a scene; it's neither original nor funny).

"},{"Title":"As My Rating Tells...","Date":"16 October 2007","Score":"5 out of 36 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" The story is your basic American comedy, a man who has a wife but who is always away on business, trying to get back to Chicago for thanksgiving. Starring Steve Martin and John Candy, this shoddy American movie, yes I used the word movie, I class movies and films differently, I feel films are motion pictures that truly deserve the title film, whereas the word movie suggests a low class motion picture. This movie is aimed at teenagers, who have no friends, so don't go out, and who will find the most immature comedy, funny.As this is a comedy, you would expect at least a few laughs, I can honestly say not once did I laugh. No I do not have a sense of humour and no I am not a narrow minded person. But each 'gag' was pretty immature for a 15 rated movie. The whole storyline and succeeding gag was awfully predictable, almost to the point where you can skip forward 5 minutes at a time.The characters, what more can I say than clichéd, you have the just plain annoying, supposed to be funny, but just annoying fat man, who, if just on his own, would make the happiest person depressed. Then you have the 'stern', pompous business man, who again is over exaggerated and who you can tell straight off that he is going to go crazy and 'lose the plot' as it were, both these characters add to the predictability of the movie and thus makes it unenjoyable.Even for what I class as a movie, and an idiotic one at that, the acting is much below par. The dramatic scores are terribly mismatched by the on screen actions, and lack of acting skills. This was Steve Martin's 21st motion picture, if I were to make and educated guess I would say this was far back in the early days, not the midst of his career. Throughout the whole movie, the actions are over exaggerated, which makes, what is 'supposed' to predominantly be a comedy, just rather unpleasant to watch.Labelling this movie, as some would, a slapstick comedy would just be a level of incorrectness never reached by any individual. This movie has undoubtedly created a new genre, idiocity. Everything is unrealistic, which makes it a really quite unwatchable, to the extent that no amount of heroin could possibly help you endure. A new meaning of the term 'snuff movie' certainly has derived form this, massacre.1987 is the year this was burdened on the world. I can say if I were over the age of 15, and all films were as god awful as this one, the whole concept of going to the cinema, let alone even watching a film would be foreign to me.John Hughes, the director and writer. I think I can maybe excuse him as this film was early on in his career, but I can say, if I were him I would have never shown my face again, due to the amount of shame about releasing such a dire movie. And as far as the actual directing goes, it doesn't take an experienced one to excrete this. Everything about the acting, writing and directing makes this movie truly pitiful.To conclude, I really cannot recommend this film enough, to stay away from. Let's take the ending, for example, as you'd expect from yet another American waste product, you have the soppy ending with the 'emotive' music, no dialogue, just slow motion shots that's makes the whole movie worthwhile. And now for the truth, you've all seen it before, a reuniting, the false smiles, the elongated hugs, just create one big wave of depression that makes you want to slit your wrists. The token and unbelievably clichéd reuniting is just so heart-warming, yes, because of all the vomit. The emotive music, yes, as you'd expect from and 80's film, you get the necessary power ballad, which just makes, probably the most embarrassing era of all time re-emerge, thanks America. Seriously, unless you are tied down and have your eyelids prised open, do not watch this, even then just look away. "}]
