[{"Title":"Utterly romantic","Date":"17 February 2006","Score":"80 out of 104 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Romanticism originally doesn't mean romance. The 19th century romantic hero was always a doomed one. The romantic characters long for something larger than life. The frailness, lightness of things is unbearable to those sensitive beings. This is why romantic stories typically end with the death of their heroes. Romanticism is the opposite of Hollywood, as there is no happy end. The epitome of a romantic story is for example Romeo and Juliet, where death is preferred to an impossible love story.Because such intense feelings are a threat, some people try to escape them by taking nothing seriously. For example, Tomas (Daniel Day Lewis), a young surgeon living in Prague in the late sixties. He is a perfect womanizer, but he never sleeps together with any woman, because he instinctively refuses any attachment. Such is also sensuous Sabina (Lena Olin), his favorite mistress and best friend, whose utmost erotic weapon happens to be... a bowler hat.When Tomas is called for an operation at a small country spa, he seduces a young ingenuous waitress named Tereza (Juliette Binoche), but is not aware that she does not take things as lightly as he does. Bored to death with her provincial life, Tereza longs for something larger than life. She is vulnerable, sentimental, attaching. When she shows up by surprise at Tomas's apartment in Prague one evening, he lets her stay. He is trapped.Neither of them suspects that they are living an intense moment in a crucial place. This is Prague, Czechoslovakia, the Eastern Block. But the winds of change are blowing in general enthusiasm, and Czechs believe that they are about to create  socialism with a human face. Encouraged by Sabina, Tereza becomes a photographer, and captures on film all the small daily life scenes, the beauty and uniqueness of every moment. Tereza's caring love can't stop Tomas having affairs with other women, much to her disarray. As she finally can't take it anymore, she decides to leave. But as she steps out on the dark streets, it sounds like an earthquake is coming. The Soviet tanks are entering the city. The reconstitution of Prague's invasion in this movie is extraordinarily intense, even more so as clips of the real events are included in the footage. Those few moments alone are strong enough to make this long movie worth seeing. Tomas, Tereza and Sabina exile themselves to Geneva. Sabina has an affair with a married Swiss man, who doesn't like bowler hats. As he eventually decides to leave his wife for her, she is very shaken, but she disappears. No attachment. It's lonely to be free. As for Tomas, Switzerland can't stop him either playing Casanova. Tereza still can't stand it, and she suddenly goes back to the land of the weak. But I said it, Tomas is trapped. He can't live without her. He can't help following her back to Prague, although it's clear there is no future for them there anymore. The story is an adaptation of a novel by much praised Czech novelist Milan Kundera, and it is one of those cases when the movie is more intense than the book. Whereas the movie is highly emotional, the book's tone is dry, cold, almost clinical.Made by American director Philip Kaufman, this picture is European in every way. It captures perfectly well the old world nostalgic atmosphere of Czechoslovakia. The music score by Czech classical composers is gripping, sometimes melancholic, sometimes frantic. The lead actors are giving their all, and this film is certainly among their best performances for all three. The supporting cast also has some big European names in it (Erland Josephson, Daniel Olbrychski, Stellan Skarsg√•rd). Cheerful performance by Czech actor Pavel Landovsky, who personally lived the Prague events. Here, he appears as a jolly and solid peasant with a pet pig called Mephisto, who follows him just everywhere, even at wedding parties!Tomas and Tereza's pet is a she-dog called Karenin. She is the symbol of their love. They adopt her at the beginning of their relationship, take her together to Geneva, but as she escapes, Tereza takes her along back to Prague. As Karenin gets ill in the end, they make her a lethal injection so that she doesn't suffer. Pretty much what will happen to them too.And well, I never knew bowler hats could be so erotic!

In particular, Juliette Binoche and Lena Olin are each astonishing in their own way.  Olin is ferociously sensual and mesmerizing, while Binoche is superlatively sympathetic and sensitive.  Two of the best female performances I can remember.  By the end of the film I was totally wrapped up in these people's lives.  This film is deeply erotic but in an intelligent and adult way that puts most other film's treatment of sex to shame.

On the road I listened to several books on CD, one of which was The Unbearable Lightness of Being. The book intrigued me, partly because near the end, like me, Tomas and Tereza had to deal with a dying pet, but also because it dealt with big themes like love, sex and loyalty in a very unusual way. Along the way, almost incidentally, it shows you what life and politics were like in Czechoslovakia's spring, before and after the Soviets moved forcibly back in the tanks.So when I got back to San Diego one of the first things I did was rent the DVD of the movie. And I wasn't disappointed. First off, I think the movie is as faithful to a book as a movie could or should be, remembering that we're dealing with two different types of media. In the commentary on the CD, for example, the screenwriter explains they decided to leave out scenes with Tereza's mother because they realized that Juliette Binoche was communicating that part of the story merely by the way she (brilliantly) portrayed the character of Tereza.Kundera's themes of lightness, heaviness, and repetition are very deep; I don't pretend to understand them completely. For me, it's enough that they intrigue, and the movie does them justice.The acting of all the principals is astounding. I never had seen Lena Olin before, and I appreciated Juliette Binoche and Daniel Day Lewis more than ever.And as much as I liked listening to the CD of the book, it did not make me cry at the end.But the movie did.

I think this film surpasses the novel, which is utterly cynical (although understandably). Even in the last moments of the novel, Teresa is concerned that Tomas is cheating on her. The film also does well by dropping much of Franz's character - he was kind of uninteresting compared to Teresa, Tomas, and Sabina. It also drops such deadweight characters as Teresa's mother, Tomas' son, and Franz's wife. Also, a ton of different coworkers are combined into a few, so that their characters have time to develop. By concentrating on the three central characters, this film blossoms past what the novel ever achieved (although the novel is arguably more historically important). Philip Kaufman and Jean-Claude Carriere also add a couple of beautiful scenes that weren't in the novel, including Tomas' and Teresa's wedding, which is one of the most beautiful scenes in filmdom.

Now suppose that the backdrop for all the action is dark, oppressive, and heavy, while all that transpires before it is light, glib, and ineffectual.  Now consider that, through the course of the play, all that is bouncy and trivial becomes overwhelmed and absorbed by the gravity of the background, like light being sucked into the gravity of a black hole, so that what was once meaningless and unimportant and even silly becomes increasingly momentous and important and valuable as the play progresses.  If you can see this outline in your mind's eye, you have a good idea about The Unbearable Lightness of Being, Milan Kundera's novel by the same name brought to life as a movie.  The film, like the novel, declares one thing  `only necessity is heavy, and only what is heavy has value.'  I so love this idea, this earth shattering insight  it effortlessly capsizes our Postmodern zeitgeist in one innocuous little phrase.  And the film expresses it beautifully.  Set in the Prague Spring of 1968, when the Soviets put down Dubcek's `Socialism with a Human Face,' the weight of these events draws the lives of a Czech doctor, his wife, and his lovers, into its orbit.  And instead of crushing them, as one might assume, it becomes the fire that purifies gold.  Tomas (Daniel Day-Lewis), for example, had previously written a treatise on Oedipus, a witty exercise in sophistry aimed at the Communist regime as a provocative analogy, nothing more.  But as the essay becomes an object of obsession to the Communists, we see Kundera's definition of vertigo come into play.  It is not the fear of falling, but the soul's defense against the desire to fall.  Tomas wanted to fall.  Why?  Watch the movie, and find out for yourself.

The film begins by introducing us to Tomas (Daniel Day-Lewis) a very charming womanizer and very intelligent, political doctor. Through all of his one night stands and emotionless sexual encounters, he only has one real lover; Sabina (Lena Olin) is a seductive, carefree artist. When Tomas gets a call to perform an operation in a spa town, he meets the woman of his dreams; Tereza (Juliette Binoche) the shy waitress who dreams of leaving her dull, unchallenging life and heading to a place with intellectuals. When Tomas heads back to Prague, she shows up at his door and they quickly move in together.This move changes his life completely. He no longer has numerous flings and one night stands, but instead only makes time for Tereza at home and Sabina on the side. When Tomas begs Sabina to provide Tereza with a job, the three embark on a journey of sexual tension, intellectual discussion and artistic wonder. However this love triangle is cut short as Soviet tanks come roaring through Czechoslovakia endangering the freedom of all three characters, who then decide to flee to Switzerland. By this time Tomas and Tereza have been long married, and Sabina meets a new man in the form of Franz (Derek de Lint) a married man who eventually leaves his wife and family for her. The danger of commitment drives Sabina away and she moves to the United States, disappearing for the entire third act of the film.It's this act that is the most interesting, as it truly examines Tomas and Tereza's tumultuous relationship. Tereza realizes that she is too dependant on him, while he could leave her at any time so she moves back to the now Soviet-controlled Prague and Tomas' love for her drives him to return there. Of course Tomas' political values, including an article he wrote criticizing the Soviet Union and 'implying' that they should all pluck their eyes out doesn't shine too well with the Soviets and they ask him to sign a letter to repudiate his article. Tomas is too proud and declines this offer, which leads to him losing his license and he has to settle to becoming a lowly window washer. But he can't hide his womanizing desires, and his infidelity drives Tereza to the same crime. Eventually her shame and the potential of her awkward lover being a Soviet who will blackmail the couple leads to the two of them moving to a rural village and living their life their together.The most beautiful and romantic elements of the film are portrayed once they move to the village. Without the temptation of infidelity and the power of political intrigue, their life becomes euphoric and simple. Tomas works in the field all day, while Tereza cooks and cleans and they are never too far away from one another. During a trip to a relatively local bar, Tomas is presented with the opportunity of an affair but quickly brings his gaze back to Tereza showing that he is finally complete with her. This blissful relationship provides overwhelming satisfaction and closure to the chaotic life they had led up to this point.Highlighting this impeccable picture are three sensational performances, a masterfully adapted screenplay full of beautiful and intriguing dialogue and quite possible the finest cinematography of the '80s. Day-Lewis perfectly encompasses the charm of Tomas with a subtle charisma that keeps my eyes glued to him every time he appears on screen. The young Juliette Binoche is adorable, shy and emotionally powerful but also plays it off very subtly. Lena Olin is overwhelmingly seductive and crafts a sense of freedom unlike any I've ever seen. These characters are all very human which means they have their fair share of flaws and the performances capture every essence of them so perfectly.

This makes me wonder if Kaufman even liked this book for he successfully made it into something else.Either that or he is simply bad. Most importantly where is the lightness?! From the very first scene, music drownes out most of the dialogue and feeling, and this continues right through the movie. I think the makers thought that by having upbeat music playing right through the movie, this would make the story feel light- however they have completely failed here. Instead the music manages to give everything that 'movie feel', in a way dramatising events so that we linger on them, so that everything actually feels heavy.Another example of the how this adaptation fails is by embellishing the story line making it more dramatic. In the movie we see Franz passing Tomas on the street, who is on his way to see Sabina. The introduction of this chance meeting/passing, which im sure didn't happen in the book, gives Tomas' story more significance than it does make it light.There are many other examples where the continuity of the story has been changed, imo for the worst, however this might have been done because the book simply doesn't convert well into a movie, such is Kundera's style. This makes we wonder if all the generous reviewers on this site were writing with their book AND movie experience in mind rather than writing about just the film. A film which is as long as it is uncompelling. For those who haven't read the book yet I recommend just reading that. For those who have, I have to say you will just be wasting your time and probably end up here writing similar stay-clear warnings.

In a light way, like Tomas; in a heavy way like Tereza; or should we find ways not to face that question, like Sabina? How much is fidelity important in a relationship? How much of the professional life can be mutilated for the sake of our loved ones? How much do we have to be involved in the political life and the social issues of our Country?Unfortunately, I haven't read Kundera's novel but after having being let down by the movie I certainly will I want to understand if the story was ruined by the movie adaptation (which is my guess) or if it was dull from the beginning.I disagree with most of the positive comments that defined the movie as a masterpiece. I simply don't see the reasons why. What I see are many flaws, and a sample of them follows.1) The three main characters are thrown at you and it's very hard to understand what drives them when making their choices.2) The secondary characters are there just to fill the gaps but they don't add nothing to the story and you wonder if they are really necessary.3) I did not like how Tomas was impersonated. Nothing is good for him. He is so self-centered and selfish. He is not human, in some sense. But when his self-confidence fails and he realizes that he depends on others and is emotionally linked to someone, I did not find the interpretation credible.4) It's very unlikely that an artist like Sabina could afford her lifestyle in a communist country in 1968. On top of that, the three main characters are all very successful in their respective professions, which sounds strange to me. a) how can Tereza become effortlessly such a good photographer? b) how can they do so well in a country lacking all the economic incentives that usually motivate people to succeed?5) The fake accents of the English spoken by the actors are laughable. And I am not even mother tongue. Moreover, the letter that Sabina receives while in the US is written in Czech, which I found very inconsistent.6) Many comments praised the movie saying that Prague was beautifully rendered I guess that most of the movie was shot on location, so it's not difficult to give the movie a Eastern European feeling, and given the intrinsic beauty of Prague is not even difficult to make it look good.7) I found the ending sort of trivial. Tereza and Tomas, finally happy in the countryside, far away from the temptations of the metropoly, distant from the social struggles their fellow citizens are living, detached from their professional lives, die in a car accident. But they die after having realized that they are happy, indeed. So what? Had they died unhappy, would the message of the movie have been different? I don't think so. I considered it sort of a cheap trick to please the audience.8) The only thing in the movie which is unbearably light is the way the director has portrayed the characters. You see them for almost three hours, but in the end you are left with nothing. You don't feel empathy, you don't relate to them, you are left there in your couch watching a sequence of events and scenes that have very little to say.9) I hated the stop the music in the restaurant scene (which some comments praised a lot). Why Sabina has got such a strong reaction? Why Franz agrees with her? I really don't see the point. The only thing you learn is that Sabina has got a very bad temper and quite a strong personality. That's it. What's so special and unique about it?After all these negative comments, let me point tout that there are two scenes that I liked a lot (that's why I gave it a two).The Naked women Photoshoot, where the envy, the jealousy, and the insecurities of Sabina and Tereza are beautifully presented.The other scene is the one representing the investigations after the occupation of Prague by the Russians. Tereza pictures, taken to let the world know about what is going on in Prague, are used to identify the people taking part to the riots. I found it quite original and Tereza's sense of despair and guilt are nicely portrayed.Finally, there is a tiny possibility that the movie was intentionally designed in such a way that Tomas types are going to like it and Tereza ones are going to hate it. If this is the case (I strongly doubt it, though) then my comment should be revised drastically.

Despite, or perhaps because of Jean-Claude Carriere's presence as co-writer with director Philip Kaufman, this tends to take the form of the odd conversation between shags rather than an attempt to turn ideas into images, leaving a rather conventional narrative about a philandering surgeon who ultimately needs the oppression of the Russian invasion rather than the freedom of the Czech Spring to focus his emotional commitments and principles. Some of this is done well, some of it less well, but at the end of the day it's just a love story, although it deals well with the personal consequences of the political crackdown and the ending is quietly moving. Which, in a way, reflects some kind of emotional triumph &#150; whereas for most of the film we don't really care for the characters, merely go along with them, by the end, like he hero, we have at least attained some genuine level of emotional commitment.Whether that entirely justifies 171-minutes of screen time is debatable, though in its defence the film never feels that long. There are moments that grate, not least the sporadically clumsy integration of the main characters into archive footage of the Russian invasion that draws attention to itself by the crude device of adding scratches only to the new footage. The photography session doesn't quite work either despite an interesting start, not quite pulling off the shift of power and veering off into self-indulgence. The performances are slightly problematic too, especially with the Czechs limited to the smaller supporting roles in an Anglo-French-Swedish-American cast leading to a variety of composite accents (often more Germanic than Slav) and a feeling that the casting directors thought Yeah, he sounds foreign, he'll do at times. Daniel Day Lewis fares well as the coldly charismatic and fickle doc but still hadn't shrugged off that well-trained British stage actor feel to his performances; Juliette Binoche is genuinely appealing in one of her more open performances, although it's a bit of a stretch that her character never loses her naivet√©; but as the more passionate of his loves Lena Olin is somewhat more problematic, her performance getting less convincing as the film progresses until rediscovering its humanity in her final scene. Of the supporting players, Erland Josephon has one good scene as a former ambassador reduced to being a janitor that underlines the way that even love and sex can be used as weapons of political oppression merely through the introduction of doubt &#150; an idea that becomes strangely more powerful because of the way Kaufman frequently fails to summon up much in the way of eroticism because he generally regards sex as joyfully comic.

The best of this movie is terrific, as well the wild culture of personal and cultural freedom at the start, the chilling invasion of Soviet tanks in the center, and the last half hour of idealized romance and happiness in the country.That kind of gives away the movie, it would seem. But in a way, the movie is about how all these things happen. This is where it gets to be about taste and patience. It's a long movie, and much of the events are not really a development of plot, but a steady continuation of a variety of relationships (mainly between the lead man and the two main women). There is a plot behind all this, especially around their leaving Czechoslovakia and then finding a return to bliss in the Czech countryside, but this doesn't drive the movie overall.For me, it wasn't enough to see these people enjoying sex and discovering conflicts between the three legs of the love triangle. Scenes were often leisurely in a way that implies we were glad to just be there and watch things happen within a pocket of frozen time, rather than through time. By that I mean, it wasn't where you were going with the emotional aspects, but it was where you were, the now of the interactions. The might actually be where the book was so successful--it created moods and scenes where you were, actually, glad to just be absorbed. For me, that wasn't always the case in the film version.Part of the problem might just be Daniel Day Lewis, who is a bit too self-satisfied, not as a character (that is certain) but as an actor. He lacks the magnetism that might sustain the unlikely and ongoing love the two women have for him, even as they know about each other. On the other hand, it's a huge, epic tale about true freedom, and a very real pursuit of happiness. And when the energy gets going, and the mood is fully expanded, there is magic. Especially, again, at the end, including the famous fade to white in the last frames, it is about a kind of heaven on earth. Who can object to that?

I thought that when a director decides to tackle such issues and to deal with such a great book, he would try harder, or at least be much deeper, and I thought such actors would not take part in something that bad.

Is this really the way to show us how naive and simple she is? really, what kind of woman picks her nose while standing in front of a man she has a crush on (or any man)? And did she have to act like a dumb retarded person the whole time? Tomas.. I don't remember ever meeting someone like Tomas, in real life. He is so unconvincing. It's like a kids movie where characters are either black or white, so the little ones can tell who is good and who is evil. Can't a womanizer be more subtle? OK, he is handsome and we know he sleeps around and loves women, can you now make him a real human being, so we can buy the whole story? And what about the silly accents? Are they Czech? is that why they have accents? why are they talking in English then? If you want the audience to forget about the whole language issue, then make them speak in English and forget about the accents. Lets forget about the language and focus on the dialogue. But what's the point in making a British actor fake a strange accent in order to play a Czech character who speaks English with his Czech friends???? it only helped in keeping me aware all the time that these people are acting. Sabina's character was very irritating to me, while she was very intriguing in the book. The Stop This Noise scene was very bad. Franz was a character with no flesh or meat. Was he a weak character? why was he agreeing with her like that? In the book, we knew enough about him (and Sabina) so we could make sense of their relationship and interaction. But not here. It's as though the director relied on the fact that we know about the characters from the book and will fill in the gaps. That's what I was doing at least, relying on my knowledge of the characters to make sense of some scenes.I can go on...I think if you attempt to turn this unusual book into a film, then you should be able to use unusual ways to create an unusual film with unusual structure, as opposed to the conventional usual narrative and storytelling. It takes a brave daring filmmaker to deal with such book. Mr. Kaufmann is not. He belongs in Hollywood.This film proves one thing if you base your lousy film on a great book, there's good chance you will get away with it, and even get praised for it.

Fran√ßois Truffaut already said it bad directors make bad movies. Don't waste your time and money. Read the book instead, it's really worth it.

Philip Kaufamn's attempt is long, has a wonderful score, chooses to have its cast speak English in eastern European accents, showcases Juliet Binoche's beauty, and I think succeeds in avoiding the heaviness, the moral weight, that the story's characters find fundamentally absent from the business of simply being alive from one moment to the next. What it doesn't quite capture is the novel's intellectual playfulness, the authorial wisdom within which the original story was set, which in the book substitutes for the enforced narrative drive of most novels. Whereas some films are best enjoyed by those who haven't seen the source material, this one might work best for those who have otherwise, some audiences could miss the point. Nonetheless, the ending is strangely affecting and true to the original story; and Daniel Day Lewis surprisingly good as a middle class Czech philanderer.

On the other hand, fragile feelings, ponderings and internal doubts are very difficult to express on the screen - without losing the pace and uniformity of the plot. It is also pity that Prague was not / could not been used, as it is a beautiful city and gives more realism than the French places used. Depicion of the socialist/communist oppression is, however, rather perfunctory, seeming not so serious as it really was in the 1970ies within the Warsaw block when hopes of intellectuals for the so-called human-faced socialism vanished as liberal steps were diminished or repealed.The cast is, of course, brilliant, in particular the bohemian m√©nage √† trois members Daniel Day-Lewis as Tomas, Juliette Binoche as Tereza and Lena Olin as Sabina - all later multiple Academy Award winners and/or nominees, and from different European countries (the movie itself is still the US one). They and some other fine European actors have provided the movie a real European atmosphere, without a Hollywood studio feeling as sometimes perceived in older movies.Nevertheless, The Unbearable Lightness of Being is still a movie high above average, enhancing historical facts as well.

However, as one either already knows or soon discovers a novel and a film are completely different media.Kaufman's vision is elegant, eloquent and enigmatic. This is necessary to translate the directness and deepness of Kundera's prose. The film unable to delve into the innermost feelings and proclivities of its characters tries to say more by saying less. The movie takes the essence and uses powerful, calculated imagery as its driving motor. This is how this strongly resembles the late Stanley Kubrick's work meticulous, hard on the actors and often also demanding on the viewers.Kundera is heard throughout by having some of its most essential prose and ideas integrated into the dialog now and then, but as you've probably guessed, the film cannot capture the sublime subtleties and evocative expansions of the novel. Franz's and Sabina's dictionary of incomprehension is only hinted at, while Tomas' son is nonexistent and Tereza's turning moment at the mountain foregone. The focus is highly on the sensuality and, primate, playful to intimate, infidelity. This was a good choice as this dichotomy requires little words to be heard. However, when the characters do speak, the dialog dashes across the screen and dances in your head to be sure. The political overtone is also present with the departure and return to Prague being treated as almost opposite end of a colour spectrum. Kundera hypothesizes on how politics and nudity are one and the same, but Kaufman shows it with vivid imagery on both sides and emblematic parallelism.The acting and editing make it all work together although there are a few low points in both instances. The two female leads are pretty much incredible. The classic music is charming and appropriate. The writing and directing are on point and the philosophy and melancholy of Kundera finds an appropriate echo in this visceral art medium.With a slow beginning, the movie quickly builds momentum and the viewer hardly realizes its long running time. The character interactions and tensions, the stunning cinematography and succession of memorable scenes and dialog inspired greatly by the original work, make the viewer actually wish the movie would go on a little longer, whisper something more to its ear. Tomas sums it up by stating his general happiness despite his unforeseen and unwanted condition. After all life is light, you cannot take it too seriously.

On the downside, the characters are too flat, too laconic, and too enigmatic to create great depth and the film is just plain too long and stuffed with too much inconsequential filler.

Sabina's art (and the fabric of the place), Tereza's photographs (and the films of the invasion) are merely the keystones for promiscuous philosophy.The sexual promiscuity is only the landscape for these explorations. But here, the manifold is linearized. It really is about sex in the context of power. All the meandering philosophizing is strained out. In its place are very serious efforts to _look_ Czech. It is a thin substitute.We have many (many!) of the best actors in the world in the traditional, non-ironic, non-layered tradition. So the thing is transformed into something, well more kitsch.

Many details are incongruous with the book, and i felt specially disappointed with the character of Tereza, Juliette Binoche failed to deliver an honest performance, she screams and tosses and turns for no reason....that is not Tereza! Tereza felt things deeply and with such profoundness that she had to scream sometimes to release all the 'unbearable' feelings she had inside...not Binoche, she screams because she doesn't know what she's doing. Lena Olin, on the other hand, delivers a great performance, because of her i fell in love with Sabina, more than i already was.

For me the most difficult scene in the film was euthanizing of a pet (but not the cause of the sad ending!). I'll never understand why directors feel the need to show the details of this process. Although the ending was sad, getting to it was extremely engrossing, with a love scene between Lena Olin and Juliette Binoche one of the most erotic I have ever seen in any film. In fact, the scene left my mouth agape as it was so explicitly sexual but without being overly graphic. I have not read the book and I am sure it would provide far greater detail of life behind the Iron Curtain but for those not interested in weighty novels, and having spent some time in eastern Europe, I can testify that this film gives the viewer some notion of what life must have been like, including the crushing of the Prague Spring of 1968. I found the inability of two obviously capable people, Day-Lewis and Binoche, to survive in the West profoundly sad, and, that they would give up personal freedom for a life where many decisions about life were made by the state hard to fathom. Yet in the end, the two came to experience a simple happiness. The three stars worked well together and there was definite chemistry between Day- Lewis and Binoche.

For some reason this one did. It's because the film critic majority, with whom I usually agree, appears to have inexplicably overrated it. It's also because the movie had the potential to be great but just wasn't.The cinematography, emphasis on Sabine in her Magic Hat, grabbed me from the beginning, but even then there was something drawn out about the pacing of the story that nagged at me. The addition of Tereza seasoned the infuriating slowness with equally infuriating character passivity. But she was undeniably luminous, and Tomas, though amoral, was charismatic, so I crossed my fingers that they'd grow as characters and went with it.I sat through Tomas insulting Tereza's intelligence by playing dumb about his infidelity. I sat through Tereza abdicating her own values out of desperation. I watched Tomas act surprised that amid his neglect and emotional detachment Tereza was not happy (imagine that!). Then, all of a sudden, about midway through, something happened. The very sight of Tomas became repulsive. I no longer gave a damn about him, and by extension I no longer gave a damn about the women who cared about him. Losing concern for the movie's characters meant I no longer cared about the movie.Which is a shame, because the politics were fascinating. The scene in which Tereza's photos result in a roundup of Czech rebels, and that in which Tomas refuses almost impishly to sign a communist declaration, were riveting. As was the emotionally complex photographic tango between Tereza and Sabine, which was anything but prurient. It was one of the most poignant power struggles I have ever seen on film, and it was the only part that burned my eyes with something like emotion. In fact, the theme of voyeurism throughout is deftly handled and arguably the film's most worthy discussion fodder.I would have enjoyed a movie whose focus was Czech-Russian politics, and sex only to the extent that intimate power-play clearly echoed and/or shed light on national power-play. At the very least, I would have appreciated a hint as to what was so gosh darn attractive about Tomas, or what screwed the women up so badly in their childhoods as to make Tomas actually look appealing to them. The mistake of the movie is its misogynist assumption that female viewers will fall for Tomas despite themselves, as Tereza did. Unfortunately for it, fortunately for us, we can see right through him. And what we see is merely a self-stroking philanderer, not worth 3 minutes of our time, let alone 3 hours.

In short, we are victims of circumstance.The story, co-written by Kaufman and Jean-Claude Carriere, is an amoral one concerning the extra-marital activity of Tomas, a doctor married to the young, timid Tereza who struggles to come to terms with his unfaithful lifestyle. Day-Lewis solidified his reputation with this accurate portrayal of pleasure seeking self-indulgence, and together with Binoche's touching portrayal of innocence and dedication, the two keep the audience interested. Lena Olin also turns in a fascinating performance as the third in a love triangle which threatens the young couple's marriage yet provides them both with their strongest friendship.Kaufman, adapting from Milan Kundera's novel, constantly tries to add a human touch to the turmoil in the world surrounding the players in his film. Mostly he succeeds, though often it is hard to sympathise with a hedonistic, self centred anti-hero.Art director Pierre Guffroy and Director of Photography Sven Nykvist have combined to grace the film with some splendid visuals and a most convincing look.

This however leads to the annoyance of Daniel Day-Lewis, a native Londoner, speaking as if he was suffering from a speech disorder or doing an awkward impersonation of a Frenchman.As always, if you read the book you'll likely be disappointed. Although Juliette Binoche does her darndest (in fact, I'd say she tries too hard), she isn't anywhere near as charming as the book version of Tereza.

I thought Tereza's character was way too harmless and cutesy, I didn't buy the fact that Sabina could live so well off her art, the pastoral idyll at the end was unrealistic and soppy, the description of the Prague Spring was superficial.The payoff is a light, romantic, entertaining movie with some great acting (Lena Olin steals the show) which won't offend anyone.

Not that my brain has been damaged by the amount of booze consumed during last night's Superbowl, oh no. Nor is it due to a particular fondness for Juliette Binoche. You see, in terms of cinematic value, this is a breath-taking exercise in film-making. Every shot feel lovingly crafted, every line of dialogue is poetry and the editing is some of the best I have seen. It's just that, in terms of entertainment, I personally found it uninvolving at times and a bit dull. Call me what you will but on some levels, it just didn't work.Adapted from the acclaimed novel by Milan Kundera, The Unbearable Lightness Of Being takes us back to Prague in the days before Soviet occupation. Care-free surgeon Tomas (Daniel Day-Lewis) spends his days sleeping around, usually with his bohemian artist lover Sabina (Lena Olin) and occasionally doing some work when he's not chatting up the nurses. After being sent to a nearby town to treat a patient, he meets the beautiful Tereza (Binoche) and against his will, Tomas falls for her after she follows him back to Prague. Gradually, Tereza and Tomas are accepted by Sabina and the three strike an unusual friendship - a friendship forever altered by the dramatic invasion of the Soviet forces and their subsequent emigration to Switzerland.I'm still not sure exactly where I stand on this film. Feeling reminiscent of Lust, Caution (which isn't a bad yardstick, as things go), there is not a single frame of this picture that looks anything less than beautiful despite the occasionally bleak subject matter. Olin and Binoche are brilliant but strangely, Daniel Day-Lewis lets the side down. He comes across as a selfish, manipulative dandy and I found it difficult to emphasise with him. I also felt he looked like Ben Stiller going through college and once that thought was there, it stuck! The supporting cast, largely unknown to most English-speaking audiences, were all faultless and deserve as much credit as the director for creating a sublime, smouldering masterpiece. The story also had its moments where it was genuinely upsetting but for the most part, it lacked any sort of narrative. It seemed to wander at will, from country to country, with little to link it like a bad James Bond movie. It also isn't as controversial as it would like you to believe - the sex, while moderately graphic, isn't a patch on what we see in mainstream movies today. This is no Monster's Ball.Maybe I'm missing something. At times, I felt like the movie was talking to me on a different intellectual plain that I couldn't understand and the fact that a lot of dialogue seems to be whispered didn't help - I needed the DVD's subtitles, that's for sure. It doesn't confuse you like Donnie Darko did but instead tests every sinew of attention as there's every chance that a small but vital line is missed or overlooked. So I'm afraid that The Unbearable Lightness Of Being didn't float my boat as I was hoping it would but it is a glorious, beautiful film which looks and sounds the business (despite its age) but doesn't offer much in the way of entertainment. Personally, I think that Secretary is a better kooky and controversial romance than this is or even Binoche's other legendary skin-flick Damage. This is more high-brow, thoughtful and European than that though and if you like a challenge then this could be the film for you.

I could not figure out through the entire film whether Tereza was actually soft in the head, or whether the impression was unintentional. Lena Olin gave a decent performance, despite the fact that she portrays a glass artist who works in her lingerie (yeah right).The Story (or lack thereof) At first, I was convinced that between the flat acting, tortured dialogue, and gratuitous sex, the movie was actually a porno being marketed as High Art. Then came the Soviet invasion footage, which was apparently tossed in as a substitute for actual character development. It was never clear after that what the point of the whole thing was, or why we were following such hollow characters. Half an hour in, the only decent ending imaginable was one in which all the protagonists died, except that when it finally happened, it felt cheap and unsatisfying.The Pacing As far as I could tell, Tereza and Tomas marry within two weeks of Tereza's moving in. Two weeks later, the Soviets invade. T&T flee to Switzerland for a month or two (this is a generous estimate) before returning to Czechoslovakia. They live in the city for a few months before relocating to the country. After another month or so (perhaps a year from the start of the movie now), the puppy that they adopted on their wedding day is now grown, has cancer and cataracts, and looks like it is fifteen years old. What. The. Hell. It is incredible that a 3-hour movie could fail so fantastically to portray the passage of time. I can't even fathom how they did it.Miscellaneous Most over-used line? Take off your clothes. (-Retch-) Also, the priceless moment where Tereza says to Tomas, 'I know you've told me a thousand times there's a difference between love and sex,' as if we've seen them have even one conversation about ANY subject, let alone a thousand on that topic alone. Then there's the simple fact that Tereza is a stalker and Tomas is a philandering player, and it makes no sense whatsoever for him to take her in, let alone marry her.If you want to see a good adaptation of a novel that is subtle and cerebral, try Revolutionary Road. If you want to be bored for 3 hours while characters stare silently at each other for embarrassingly long periods of time, try The Unbearable Lightness of Being. (The 'unbearable' part is dead-on.)

But as a standalone work, this film has serious problems.  Essentially it about three bohemians and the inter-personal problems.  The Prague Spring of 1968, although dramatically re-created, serves as a minor inconvenience to the main characters.  Our protagonists are never detained or sent to a labor camp or forced to live in substandard housing or suffer from malnutrition.  Instead, their worries center around their sex lives and dysfunctional relationships.  But even these problems are handled superficially.  Daniel Day-Lewis gives one-note performance, with an annoying accent to boot.  Lena Olin is sexy and mysterious, but her character is a spoiled brat.  Only Juliette Lewis gives a great performance and has a character who can evoke empathy from the viewer.I don't understand why this movie was so popular when it was released. Maybe it was the reputation of the book.  Maybe it was people's fascination with the crumbling Soviet empire.  Maybe it was the film's glorification of the bohemian lifestyle.  Maybe it was the steamy sex scenes.  Whatever it was, the film doesn't hold up in the new millenium.

Freedom for self and for sexual expression. With self expression repressed under the dictat of the Soviet, sexual expression becomes a cry for freedom within itself.Daniel Day-Lewis is brilliant as Tomas, the brain surgeon cum lothario. His performance is disciplined and understated as events overtake Tomas's ability to control his destiny. He has an arrangement with Sabina (Lena Olin), a sculptor who also can find no place for love without freedom in her life. Their relationship is based upon friendship and convenience. Their lovemaking is passionate but not empty or cold. If there is love, it is left unspoken.Kaufman uses this relationship as the foundation of the movie with most of the dynamic being centered upon the naive country girl (Juliette Binoche) who rebels against the crushing of the Prague Spring by photographing the brutality.The trio escape to Switzerland. Geneva then plays a major role in this film as being emblematic of an alternative freedom; a freedom that feels heavy with responsibility. Maybe, within western democracy, when everybody has a voice, then the individual can no longer be heard. Maybe, if there are no small victories, then there is no true lightness. Their freedom can only be felt within context.Finally, Thomas and Tereza return home to a Soviet Prague. Again, via censure, the communists provide the answer.Sabina finds a beach side property in California, opting for bland airbrushed seascapes. She lives alone. Her spirit has been quelled by the freedom that surrounds her.This is truly a beautiful European film. Not in the ersatz 'Chocolat' style, but in the tradition of Krieslowski and Wajda. Within itself, it is a very moral film. It has a simple beauty, that does not wear its heart on its sleeve, but within the wonderfully understated performances. These also include Derek De Lindt and the great Stefan Skarsgaard, one of the finest actors anywhere today.This is not just a movie, it is also thought provoking cinema.

In this case, however, this would have been little more than an easy device, and bravo to the director for not resorting to it.All this said, the question of what kind of film is this remains, and I will not attempt an answer. It can't be taken as an introduction to Kundera, because it presupposes Kundera. I can't even completely agree with the Hollywood trivialization theory. There are enough bad John Grisham novels around to produce Hollywood movies for the next 100 years.This film may have been an attempt to establish a new relation between film and novel, one characterized by a greater interpretative freedom and greater adaptation to the need of the medium in which the novel is translated. If this was the goal, then Kundera was certainly an ambitious start, and the fact that the attempt was only a half success should be taken as a credit to the director, and not as his failure.P.S.

Tomas seemed inappropriately heavy. Sure, he was an unabashed womanizer, but his womanizing seemed more like a obsessive drive than a fun, lighthearted pursuit. Could the director lightened him up by using an actor less gaunt and intense than Daniel Day Lewis? I suspect so, although DDL lightened up considerably in some of the movie's later scenes.Juliette Binoche as Tereza, in that sense, seemed completely the opposite of Tomas. Rightly or wrongly, her playfulness went past the mark into childish habits such as picking her nose in one scene. And of course, she was noticeably sexually repressed compared to Tomas and Sabina. Despite her claim late in the movie that her emotional weight was stifling him, when the couple was together, she seemed to be the playful one, while he was ever taciturn and moody. Probably, he found any sort of monogamy stifling. On that count, the movie didn't adequately show why he agreed to marry Tereza in the first place. Did the book?In any case, the movie did a wonderful job of displaying varying kinds of emotional lightness and showing how any one of them can be decisive or divisive in a relationship. Certainly, the commitment-versus-freedom dichotomy was a stumbling block in Tomas's and Tereza's relationship, and in the developing tryst between Sabina and Franz. In contrast, the lassitude between Tomas and Sabina was a strength. It played into Tereza's relationship with her countries of residence and into Sabina's relationships with hers. It was also interesting to see how Tereza's career in photography varied from light female nudes to heavy violence in the Prague uprisings.All in all, a solid film that probably didn't quite do justice to the book.

Soaking his story in a liberal smattering of Janacek tunes (and an excellent version of Hey Jude), Kaufman's film follows its three protagonists - Tomas (Daniel Day-Lewis); Sabina (the lovely Lena Olin, who provides the defining image of the film, crouched with her hat at an angle); and innocent Tereza (the first time many of us saw Juliette Binoche, who was excellent).I remember 'The Unbearable Lightness of Being' with affection as it was one of those 'forbidden' films which appealed to the adolescent as well as those looking for a bit more political consciousness. It proved that Day-Lewis was an excellent actor, and in Sabina, it gave us one of the classic sexy images of modern cinema. True to Kundera's novel? Well, perhaps in the spirit of it rather than being totally faithful. But never less than engaging.

Nevertheless, I decided to given Kaufman's cinematic adaptation of the book a try since I've heard so much good from it. In short, I find little wrong with this film. I like how the movie utilizes the characters more than the plot itself, primarily because I miss movies that emphasize character development over spectacle. In terms of analyzing the characters I think we see how tradition and antiquity (represented by Sabina's hat) are the things we cling to in order to achieve some degree of continuity in life. Still, there are moments in which you have to reach outside of the characters. For instance, to analyze Tomas' infidelity, the historical context of the movie must be emphasized since the antitypical symbol of infidelity in the film is the demonstrations of protest against the communist takeover of Hungary in 1968. This is also one of those rare movies where the melding of docudrama and romance works perfectly. I'm glad that I've seen this film, I can't say if it achieves the same greatness as The Right Stuff (how many movies do?), but still, a great film.

After seeing it, I have a hard time seeing myself liking any of his other work more.  I have not read the Milan Kundera novel, although I surely plan to, but the film is something like I have never seen before.  I would go so far to say it is The Last Tango in Paris without screwing around and actually saying something in the end.  A week after seeing the film, I was still thinking about it.  The unprolific Daniel Day-Lewis turns in a good enough performance.  However, Lena Olin and Juliette Binoche turn in a couple of the most subtley profound performances by any actress.  Surely Binoche should be considered one of the great females in film in the next decade.  ...Lightness... is very moody, and this is often the film's strongest point.  Even when it seems there is just not much going on plotwise, you are simply pulled in by the haunting cinematography and rich characters.  The light, playful piano riffs serve as a very appropriate supplement to the film's bleak tone.  The picture repeatedly refuses to give into conventionality, and just when we don't know what else it could do, it surprisingly shifts into a sentimental gear for the last act.  This is, however, credible and unmanipulative.  The characters shed much superficiality by this point, and by the end they are not annoying soap opera characters in a love triangle, but rather real people with real problems.  I am glad the studio allowed the near three-hour running time, because, otherwise, we would not feel as if we have just finished the journey of character that the principle on-screen characters have.  Thank you Philip Kaufman for NOT turning in a crowd-pleaser.

The young Czechs are dancing and grooving to the people's revolution as many people around the world did.Tomas is a brilliant brain surgeon with the appropriate 1960s sex life (but surely his apartment would have been bigger and better and he would be driving some sort of sports car).Then he meets Tereza reading Tolstoy and he finds monogamy of a sort. She is monogamous and faithful and he still sleeps around. This is where the title comes in. He is a light person who floats over the troubles of life and she is much heavier. Perhaps they balance each other out.Such little problems as their sex life don't matter much when the Russians send the tanks in. This is really just the challenge needed to explore their characters.This is probably one of the most overrated movies from the 1980s. Bland, European style sex scenes contribute little the story while the dialog either progresses the story or is simply explaining what the author thinks. The characters are reduced to cyphers and I am sure Daniel Day-Lewis's hair cut says something important but I don't know what. Surely the first things the soviets would have done is make him get a sensible haircut.This movie does say something and that message is the reason to watch the movie. But the characters and story are just not worth the trouble. Certainly those people who love the many similar movies from Europe will find something here. "}]
