Featuring Oscar-winning and nominated stars like Lemmon, Grant, de Havilland, Quinlan, Kennedy and Stewart, it also offers one of the best caliber casts of the '70's disaster cycle.  There is no deep thinking involved in watching the film, but it does offer some watery thrills and some fun thrashing around as the plane first skips along the surface of the water and then slips under.  Suspense builds as the pressure continues to wreak havoc on the plane's outer skin and, unusually for an Airport film, pretty many lives are claimed!  The death toll in this film is higher than the other three combined.  It's great to see so many once and future stars flopping around in the underwater tomb, but the main attraction is Lee Grant.  Clocking in with only about a dozen or so total minutes of screen time, she is utterly hilarious and unforgettable as a shrewish, boozy, sarcastic lush.  No one is safe from her rude, brash comments and she is a joy to behold for bad-move connoisseurs.  Her husband in the film is Christpher Lee.  Fortunately, they didn't marry offscreen or she would have become Lee Lee, but that's another story.......

Of course this attracts the attention of a few crooks who have a pretty well thought out plan and the copilot, Robert Foxworth, working with them. Of course all good plans go awry and they go down in the Bermuda Triangle into some relatively shallow area of the Atlantic.Hey they could have gone down and been lost for decades like the Titanic was.That's essentially the plot here and in true Seventies disaster film tradition you load the screen with big names, dress them fashionably and put them in harm's way. The rest of the film is devoted to their rescue.Incidentally the footage devoted to the air sea rescue is the best thing about Airport 77. No member of the audience will not go away impressed with the U.S. Navy's capabilities in that regard.Jack Lemmon is the pilot and in an action role which is normally against type for him, he does quite well. Almost twenty years before he supported James Stewart in Bell, Book,and Candle and now the billing is most definitely reversed.My favorites in the film are Joseph Cotten and Olivia DeHavilland, a classy and elegant pair of passengers who so typify the glamor of old Hollywood.Christopher Lee also performs against type, he's not the villain here in fact he turns out quite the hero among the passengers. Lee Grant is his trollop of a wife and I remember seeing this in theaters and the shouts for joy from the audience when Brenda Vaccaro punches her out.I'm not sure which is a wilder rescue this one or that other James Stewart film The Flight of the Phoenix. There's no way any of them should survive.But this is a Hollywood disaster epic, so all things are possible.

In typical Airport fashion, a routine plane ride, this time carrying various celebrities and other high-profile people, gets into some trouble when it crashes into the ocean in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle....Though the decor of the flash plane filled with VIP's is dreary compared to the fabulous colours of the chairs in Airport 1975, the characters are a major improvement, along with the actual danger that the passengers and crew are placed in.In typical Disaster Movie style, the cast is large, and many of them are forgettable, however, stand-out performances in Airport '77 include Jack Lemmon in a serious role as the likable Captain Gallagher, Lee Grant is Karen Wallace a VIP guest of the nasty variety, the underrated Pamela Bellwood as a young mother, the lovely Kathleen Quinlann is as usual outstanding, but unfortunately under-used here, but the stand-out star of the film is of course Brenda Vaccaro as Captain Gallagher's girlfriend Even Clayton. Vaccaro is certainly one of the better leading ladies in a Disaster Movie, but is also a surprising choice. Nevertheless, she is fantastic, it is a shame she is not more recognized for her work.Overall, Airport '77 is a terrific, and often overlooked addition to the genre, with a super cast, great direction, and a very interesting scene in which the plane is raised from the ocean, according to the credits, this is the actual method used by the Navy, which is a nice addition to the film.

But looking back at the hot pants in Poseidon Adventure & Dunaway's dress and the tuxedoes in Towering Inferno, Airport '77 is quite an elegantly dressed cast, aren't they?The movie would get famed Hollywood fashion expert Edith Head to dress the cast and it shows. Anyone else would have made Brenda Vaccarro look obese trying to put her in that pullover sweater.Airplane! would make fun of Edith Head being credited for '77 like that, by crediting their own costumer, but 27 years later, the wardrobe makes the cast of '77 appear tremendously dashing, giving the tragedy that greater a feel as well.Jack Lemmon was an incredible standout as the hero of the piece, in comparison to Paul Newman's sexism in Towering Inferno (he never speaks to Jennifer Jones as a human during their entire ordeal with the children) or Heston's stiffness or McQueen's inexpressiveness. Two years after her Oscar nomination, Vaccarro was hardly the disaster flicks idea of a leading lady as well, so she is quite a one-of-a-kind casting also.When I was little, I was most fascinated with Arlene Golonka, who I knew from the Andy Griffith show. Later, identifying the rest of the cast just made it more and more fun. Dracula, Buck Rogers, Kolchak the Nightstalker (Darren McGavin & Jack Lemmon were a powerhouse duo).Then the names and stars figured into it. DeHavilland, Cotten, Grant. No one looked more out of place than Olivia DeHavilland in an underwater airplane.Robert Hooks as the crippled bartender and Tom Sullivan (who is actually blind) as the pianist added even more flavor. There is M. Emmet Walsh, The Name, But What Which One Is Him? actor. He is the doctor, and I do enjoy his one scene when he explains who he really is.Monica Lewis, disaster movie staple. She would appear in Earthquake and Concorde Airport '79. Check out her expression as she and Olivia DeHavilland enter the lifeboat. It reads Miss DeHavilland, I'm one of your biggest fans. I really enjoyed you in Gone With The Wind.  Lucy Ricardo lives.Should it have been a commercial airline, instead of a private plane? Not necessarily. I enjoy watching it now and observing a few of the female extras at the beginning of the crash don't seem to be present anymore by the end. It seems that they weren't available for filming then. I would argue, as a movie, that this one is more fun to watch than the first one. Lancaster and Seberg in the first Airport movie are comical to me trying to be so serious.And the second Airport movie, Airport '75, is funnier than Airplane.There is a very strong and different feel from Airport '77 than the other Airport flicks or the other disaster films in general.

Just to add to their woes, while flying low to avoid radar they crash into an oil rig and end up submerged on an unstable ocean ledge in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle while the 747 does a very bad impersonation of a submarine. Since the Navy can't lower the ocean, the only thing to do is to raise the Titanic &#150; sorry, raise the Jumbo Jet&#133; Unfortunately it never quite makes enough of it, with so much time setting up the plot and the characters that the movie's half over before the plane hits the water and there's less time for plot twists or surprises than you'd like. It doesn't help that, hijackers aside, the passengers are a generally likable bunch of old Hollywood and beloved TV stars - Felix Unger (Jack Lemmon), Dracula (Christopher Lee), Kolchak (Darren McGavin), Hooky from Zulu (James Booth), Rick Deckard's boss (M.

The thing that the movie does well is hold your attention to the very end. You genuinely care for some of the characters involved primarily because of the good acting by leads like Jack Lemmon, who plays the pilot in this one. The danger also seems very real all the way up to the end which adds to it's believability. The movie starts setting up the story as an airline president and master collector, played by Jimmie Stewart, is promoting the opening of a museum and a new plane that will be sent down to the island paradise with his very special guests. Included on the plane are his daughter and grandson, whom he has not seen for a very long time. A small group including one of the co-pilots decide to capture the plane while it's airborne, putting the passengers to sleep, in hopes to take it's valuables and run off to South America. Their plan goes awry when the pilot crashes in a shallow part of the ocean(wherever that might be) in the Bermuda triangle. The rest of the movie is an underwater rescue movie as the plane drifts to the shallow bottom. There are the usual stupid moments, like allowing the pilot to go nuts but the women passengers can't for some reason, and the attempt to save the plane in-tact with the people is a little far-fetched. These are the moments that get you talking to the screen. But despite this, the overall effect of the movie is satisfying which I honestly didn't expect because these movies usually don't appeal to me. I really think that the strong presence of the believable hero in Jack Lemmon as the pilot really helped the movie become a little more than the typical disaster movie for me.

I mean, have you seen some of the garbage big stars make today? It's not all for the Oscars, believe me. This one of those great movies you can actually enjoy for a few hours. An early popcorn flick - like all the disaster films were.In this sequel, Jack Lemmon plays the ever-present Heroic Captain who must save the day as his ship gets a) hijacked, b) crashed into the ocean and c) lost by the search planes. Sure, the plot's out there - no way would a plane not break apart under the ocean, etc, etc, but who cares? Sure, the ending's basically a commerical for the NAVY. It's all fun - and tasteful fun - not the tacky, cheap, makes-you-feel-like-you've-killed-brain-cells-by-watching feel of The Swarm or Airport 75 or 79. The best bits are the action scenes - when the hijackers take over, when the plane crashes into the ocean and the thrilling rescue mission at the end. I was LITERALLY on the edge of my chair!My favorite parts were really the relationships on the plane. Sure, they were underwritten and great actors were ill-used (*ehm* Christopher Lee, Olivia De Havilad and Joseph Cotton), but there were hints of realism there. The touching love between the piano player and Kathleen Quinlan. The lovely reunion between rich folks De Havilad and Cotton (and she looked so dignified when tumbling around in the sinking craft!). The sweet 70's romance between Jack Lemmon and Brenda V. (and she was more James Stewart's secetary then Head Stewardess!). I think I liked that relationship the most because they did seem to have actual chemistry - something that was lacking in even the great Airport. OK, so this isn't Oscar material, but it's a great popcorn flick right up there with Towering Inferno and Poseidon Adventure. The actors do seem to take themselves seriously (well, except for the bitchy wife of rich chap Christopher Lee, Lee Grant) and aren't totally phoning in their performances. Lemmon gives the best performance here and he seems to relish the role of hero. Good for him to break the mold! Too bad he couldn't do it more often. BOTTOM LINE A darn good action flick that ranks up there with Towering Inferno and Poseidon Adventure. Watch this if you want to be thrilled and watch the time fly by.

If you want some disaster fun this is it. A plane crashes into the sea and survivor's must fight for their lives. Some may make it and some may not.

Modern jets will float for a half-hour or more, but once they start flooding, they don't stop until the cabin is uninhabitable. The intricate solution to this problem is just the first in a long series of hoops the producers had to jump through after saying, `Let's do a film about a jumbo jet that sinks in the Bermuda Triangle with the passengers still alive inside!'Airport '77 is the gloomy response to this challenge.  Art thieves hijack a specially equipped and highly luxurious private 747 to loot her expensive cargo.  In the process of flying stealthily below radar, the copilot/thief (Meredith) strikes an oil drilling platform and loses control of the airplane.  After a brief struggle to stay aloft, the jetliner settles onto the surface of the water, but not before a massive storage container tears loose and punches a fatal hole in the forward cargo compartment.And therein lies the solution to the first problem.  Like the customization of a conversion van from the same era, this private jet has been modified to contain a series of individually pressurized cargo holds.  When the forward cargo compartment floods, the rest of the plane is left dry.  Within minutes, however, the weight of the water pulls the plane to the floor of the ocean, with most of the passengers still alive and plenty of doors and windows leaking ominously.Airport '77 starts with heavy-handed drama and never lets up.  There's not much room for humor in a 747 several hundred feet under the water, but Airport '77 doesn't even attempt to lighten the mood occasionally. Better disaster movies pull the audience from one emotional extreme to another, but on this plane, the dialogue is suffocating even before the oxygen starts to run low.  There isn't anyone in charge of bringing hope to the survivors (and the audience).And despite their occasional humanitarian efforts, this group of super-rich, mostly white passengers does little to elicit sympathy from the audience. Only the head flight attendant (Vaccaro) invites compassion.  Her romance with the pilot (a mustache-laden Lemmon) isn't adequately explored, particularly when he volunteers to leave the plane in a risky maneuver that might easily kill him.  Meanwhile, virtually the entire support staff of the plane magically disappears so that the drama can focus on the wealthiest and presumably most interesting group aboard.The tone of this film is gloomy right from the start, and bad cinematography doesn't help.  Every room (on the plane or elsewhere) is dark, and every cast member seems to be covered with a thin layer of reflective slime even before the plane sinks!  It's as though good lighting and decent makeup were dispensed with just to darken the mood.The sun-drenched rescue operations offer the possibility of relief from the closed quarters of the plane, but instead we receive an abundance of stock Naval rescue footage.  Generous thanks are paid to the men and women of the armed services who assisted in the production of this movie, and we know this to be true because the final third of the movie is so boring.Airport '77 has the most elaborate special effects of any Airport movie, and they are enjoyable to watch.  All of the external effects are clear, and the flooding inside the plane is done as well as can be expected.  Aside from the abundance of dark brown furniture (and carpet, and paint, and wallpaper) it's the relentlessly dim lighting that clinches the claustrophobia. Though possibly necessitated by the depth of the plane underwater, the resultant sense of suffocation only disengages the viewer further.  The cheap special effects of The Concorde Airport '79 indicate that the lesson was learned that good effects won't save a mediocre film.In short, Airport '77 just isn't fun enough.  It's a clever premise and the producers went to great lengths to get the plane underwater in a satisfactory manner.  But if it's not the weighty dialogue, it's the unengaging Naval training footage, and so the audience quickly discovers that there's really not that much to enjoy here after all.  Airport '77 is fun to watch for the crash and flooding sequences (as well as Darren McGavin's dependable character acting), but seat-of-your-pants thrills are best found elsewhere.

It has perhaps the best cast of names of any disaster film, including Jack Lemmon (curiously cast as a pilot), Lee Grant and Robert Foxworth (who would both appear a year later in 'Damien Omen II' (1978)), Christopher Lee, Brenda Vaccaro, George Kennedy, Olivia de Havilland, Joseph Cotten AND James Stewart, to mention just some of the biggest names.Also, as the poster suggests, most of the action takes place underwater. This is also where audiences do most of the over-thinking. Don't worry about it being a plane - just buy into the possibility that James Stewart's character was so stinking rich and so concerned about his passengers and his art treasures that he bothered to make it the equivalent of a flying submarine (but a fragile one)!This is an outrageous film - there are no two ways about it - but it certainly beats the cartoon-ish sequel featuring the Concorde, which stinks to high heaven in comparison!It also possibly provided some vital training work for director Jerry Jameson before he went on to helm the doomed 'Raise The Titanic' (1980). What can be said for this film is that it certainly didn't sink as quickly as that film did! Universal Studios actually set up a ride where paying customers could be held hostage aboard a luxury airliner, before being (fictionally) rendered unconscious and then dunked in the drink. For such an audacious and exciting-sounding ride to even be dreamt up, this film had to have been a considerable success!! And, perhaps, Brenda Vaccaro was comforted for suffering pneumonia after filming this flick by the thought that all those innocent theme park tourists were suffering a similar fate!Anyway, aside from the Concorde sequel, this is the most outrageous of the 'Airport' films - if any of them could actually be considered realistic viewing, then that's one on me!Watching Lee Grant acting her co-stars in circles is a great pleasure to be gained from this entry into the franchise and the special effects, although dated now, of course, are still a lot of fun to watch! And this is a fun film, blending the heist films of the 1960s and 1970s with the purely 1970s disaster craze. For the cast and the excitement, thrills and spills alone, give this film a watch if you're looking for something that will take your mind off of things and give you a good laugh as well!

Earthquake wasn't TOO bad. Only reason to watch it really was for the earthquake sequence itself and feel it in Sensesurround (The prequel to todays Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound). Airport 77 is the perfect movie to watch on your day off at home and no one else is at home to bother you. But it must be seen in its original widescreen format. I hate watching movies, especially disaster movies, in full screen. You have no idea what your missing in full screen. Action, action and more action is on both sides of the screen but it is cropped off and zoomed in to fit on a television screen. Thank goodness for DVD.

If I was a movie executive, I would not have given the green light to this project because the story idea is incredibly far-fetched.But for some reason, I stayed with the movie because of the strong performance of Jack Lemmon as the heroic pilot. He really got into his role and he did not look like he was slumming. He almost made this unlikely disaster flick credible.With most disaster movies, I did not care whether the characters lived or died and many of the heroes were, arguably, bland and the actors were in the movie just for the paycheck. Although Lemmon's performance did not save the movie, at least his appearance made Airport '77 a better than mediocre disaster flick.

But after the Golden Age of MGM ended, it took individual producers to put together big star filled epics to continue Louis B. Mayer's dream. Disaster films of the 1970's were filled with stars, and in the case of the third entry of the Airport series, it is loaded. Six of the stars were Oscar nominees or winners, and there are other Legends among they are surrounded by other familiar faces of both the past and present. Unfortunately, what became camp in the second entry thanks to Karen Black having to learn how to fly a plane with one lesson over the radio, now becomes over the top and often ridiculous. But I dare you to turn your eyes away once you hit play on your DVD player.The plot of this lavish Thriller surrounds a plane filled with VIPs heading to James Stewart mansion on a island in the South Atlantic, and valuable cargo aboard, the plane is ripe for art thieves getting onto the plane and taking over, ultimately getting it into the course of the Bermuda Triangle. Passengers are drugged and knocked out, and when they awaken, they find themselves at the bottom of the ocean and no way to get out. But as long as Lee Grant has a collection of mini bottles, she will be fine. The rest of them, not so much.Among the others on the plane are Jack Lemmon, this time the one flying it, Christopher Lee as grants wealthy long-suffering husband, Olivia de Havilland as a patron of the Arts who has a penchant for poker, Joseph Cotten as her old flame, and Brenda Vaccaro as Lemmon's fiancé. Maidie Norman, the housekeeper for Jane and Blanche Hudson, is de Havilland's companion, giving an ironic connection to Baby Jane's follow-up, Hush, Hush Sweet Charlotte. Pamela Bellwood looks on lovingly at blind pianist Tom Sullivan who doesn't sing very well, making that scene rather tedious. When next seen, they are sharing an emotional farewell, but having only been on momentarily, the audience doesn't really have a chance to get to know them enough to care. Just as it seems that it couldn't get any more silly, George Kennedy shows up, once again repeating his role from the first two movies. Robert Foxworth and Monte Markham are the bad guys,and they truly deserve what they get.Some great action sequences really make this gripping in spots, but while you do indeed care about the plight of these passengers, the way it is presented is so ridiculous and melodramatic that you're both clenching your fists and laughing uncomfortably at some of the absurd details deep within the story itself.Certainly in the 1970's, disaster films were at their height, and with a cast like this, it was bound to succeed at the box office. It was definitely a crowd-pleaser, but in retrospect, it is often absurd. Obviously, the producers were running out of ideas and with one film left in the series, the movie became right for parody, and that became the Excellence classic farce Airplane! which makes these films all the more unintentionally funny.

The premise is certainly goofy--thieves hijack a luxury airliner with art treasures in the cargo hold. Their theft is going according to plan until the plane hits an oil rig and goes down, submerged intact about 100 feet down in the Atlantic. The Navy rushes to save the passengers before the hull caves in and/or everyone runs out of air.Incredibly, the movie is actually not bad. Airport 77 has some advantages that some of the other sequels do not have. First, it has a really good cast, with Jack Lemmon as an appealing hero/pilot, Brenda Vaccaro as a sympathetic and vulnerable flight attendant, Christopher Lee as a virtuous passenger, and James Stewart lending a bit of class as the worried jet owner. Olivia de Haviland and Joseph Cotten also give this movie a bit of old-fashioned umph, and, lo and behold, there is some real acting acting here. Add to this the really cool Navy rescue sequences and some really good cliffhangers, and you will actually find yourself absorbed in what is going on. What develops is an interesting cross between Airport and the Poseidon Adventure, as the Navy desperately tries to raise the 747 from the depths. Honestly this is not a bad option if you are looking to escape from your life for a couple of hours. A good disaster movie from the 70s is never looking to achieve cinematic greatness ala Citizen Kane; it only seeks give its watchers a bit of fun.

Instead it comes across as dour, so much so that the notion of a guitar-plucking nun would have probably proved a welcome breather (one horrible song is squeezed into this one too though, this time delivered by a blind pianist with a shaky voice which occasionally slips into a rather disconcerting falsetto). Far from it being the film's only problem, Airport 1977 also lacks any of the freshness of the original Airport, unintentional hilarity of the first sequel or the howl-with-laughter-in-disbelief aspect of the Concorde film that followed it. No outstanding eye candy in this one either - Quinlan and Belwood (who?) are certainly no match for the star power of Jacqueline Bisset or Jean Seberg. What we do have here instead is an abundance of putty-coloured and beige decor that is arguably easier on the eye than the raving pink and violet schemes of Airport 1975, but is also that much more lifeless in return. Instead of Gloria Swanson dispensing improvised nonsense to anyone who'll listen, here we get to watch Olivia De Havilland making goo-goo eyes at an alarmingly aged Joseph Cotten. Jack Lemmon and Jimmy Stewart act like it's 1954, Christopher Lee delivers his lines with a distinct look of someone with a poker up their bum, and Brenda Vaccaro takes over head stewardess duties from Karen Black. She isn't flying the plane in this story, but instead gets the commendable task of shutting up Lee Grant in one clean sweep across the chops (while another woman screams Oh my God, oh my God hysterically in the background - I reckon this is timed politely by the production team to wake you up should you have dozed off by now). Elsewhere, from Edith Head's costumes (a baffling Oscar nomination if ever there was one) to the score by John Cacavas, everything seems to have taken the turn for the duller compared to the previous instalment. The film is further burdened by an excruciatingly elaborate rescue sequence that's heavy on detail but rather thin on suspense. All in all, it's remotely watchable but way too stodgy and nowhere near as entertaining - accidentally or not - as any of the other Airport instalments.

Once the plane is hijacked you think that the suspense will go in but even that didn't work out. the suspense lays in the fact that the plane is flying under the radar and is actually flying just above the see, but due a lot of clouds the pilot isn't aware that the plane is going to ditch.The effect used for the ditching looked a bit funny, really, the tail of the plane entering the water and still it can fly again in the air?

With water coming in and their oxygen supply going, the pilot must find a way to get people to the surface.The third film in the series is actually the best thanks in large part to a terrific cast, some nice direction and a plot that's actually quite suspenseful. I'm not going to get into all the logical questions that could be made throughout the picture. In fact, I'll leave it to other experts to chime in on how much of what we see could actually happen but to me this is a movie made for entertainment and it's not meant to be some sort of documentary on the subject. I'm sure just about every one of these disaster pictures could be beaten to death in regards to reality but it's the entertainment that's important.What I've always liked about this installment is that the action and situation itself is just downright genius at times in regards to how it draws you in and keeps you entertained. I mean seriously, can you imagine being stuck at the bottom of the ocean on a crashed plane knowing you can either drown or suffocate to death? The situation manages to be handled with great skill by director Jerry Jameson who manages to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. I really like how they constantly warn the viewer that there are several things that could go wrong at any minute and disaster would happen again. The special effects are pretty good for what they are as the crashing was quite believable and looked very good. The scenes underwater were also wonderfully filmed and contain some nice atmosphere.The cast, as you'd expect, features all sorts of legends doing their thing. Lemmon is very believable as the captain and manages to make you feel at ease knowing he's trying to rescue everyone. Lee Grant is perfect as an alcoholic woman battling her own demons as well as her husband perfectly played by Christopher Lee. Then you've got vets Joseph Cotten and Olivia de Havilland playing their parts with ease and of course it's always great to see James Stewart even if he's basically just here to add another name to the cast. There's also George Kennedy returning and a young Kathleen Quinlan.AIRPORT '77 is certainly the best made film in the series and I also think it's the one that takes the subject the most serious.

Number three in the aerial disaster series is AIRPORT '77, which is essentially just another all-star disaster movie. But since I'm a fan of these kind of movies, this is a rather entertaining entry in the successful series. It's not as good as the first movie, but it has a better cast and better production values than its immediate predecessor AIRPORT 1975.Proving once again that's perfectly watchable in any role he lands in, James Stewart plays billionaire Philip Stevens, who has turned one of his old estates into a million dollar-worth art museum. His guest, which reads like a who's who of the rich and famous, are being transported to the museum via private 747 piloted by Capt. Gallagher (Jack Lemmon). But a bunch of crooks want a taste of the expensive cargo, so they hijack the plane and drives it clear out of the radar's range. But when they plane gets lost in the Bermuda triangle, the plane crashes and submerges in the middle of the ocean, leaving the passengers in a claustrophobic fight for survival in the vein of THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE.The cast is much better this time around, instead of a who's who of Hollywood has-been's and TV stars as the previous AIRPORT 1975, including Brenda Vaccaro as a flight stewardess and Gallagher's girlfriend, Christopher Lee as a selfless marine biologist married to bitchy alcoholic wife Lee Grant and Olivia De Havilland and Joesph Cotten landing in some great supporting performances. The art-direction (which was nominated for an Oscar) and special effects are especially effective for its time. The plot has a few holes (how exactly can a plane still be intact in a crash like that?) and some of the cheesier subplots, like the love story between the Kathleen Quinlan character and the blind guy, could have been disregarded to much better effect. Nonetheless, AIRPORT '77 is an enjoyable disaster movie that ranks as the best of the AIRPORT sequels.Rating ***1/2 out of 5.

In fact, compared to the other Airport sequels, it qualifies as high art, simply because director Jerry Jameson and his all-star cast (Jack Lemmon, Brenda Vaccaro, Lee Grant, Darren McGavin, Christopher Lee, Olivia DeHavilland, Joseph Cotten, etc.) actually take the whole thing seriously and seem to be trying to do good work, instead of phoning in inept cameos and working harder at cashing paychecks than giving decent performances.The plot is definitely the film's weakest component  luxury jumbojet full of jetsetters (and two children for sympathy's sake) and priceless artwork is hijacked by a gang of art thieves (and a crooked copilot) and driven into the Bermuda Triangle after the pilot and passengers are knocked out with nerve gas.  The plan is to land on an island and make off with the art while the passengers sleep.  Unfortunately the co-pilot runs the plane into a radio transmitter and they crash into the water.  Luckily for the passengers who survive the impact, the plane is evidently built like a tank and pressurized like a submarine, since it doesn't break up and sinks to the bottom of the ocean.  It's up to the passengers to figure out a way to save themselves, since they're 200 miles off course and no one knows where they are.Now, obviously, this premise doesn't hold water (pardon the pun).  The plane would break up either on impact or while sinking, due to the incredible pressure of the outside water.  That's a given.  But suspend disbelief and you have a pretty nifty premise.  And unlike Airport 1975, the set-up to the accident is well-done and sustains interest and the aftermath actually is well-paced and the rescue scenes exciting and believable.  There is no filler here--no silly comic relief, no characters that don't fit into the plot in one way or the other--unlike the previous sequel's Hollywood Squares cast of worthless caracitures.  That's not to say that stereotypes don't abound (Grant is particularly annoying as a one-dimensional, nearly psychotic rich bitch who actually at one point says What's going to happen to me?), but they're less annoying than usual, and are inhabited by some good character actors-- Lee in a rare saintly role, Kathleen Quinlan, Robert Hooks, Robert Foxworth (quite good as the villain), DeHavilland as a rich matron and Cotten as her one-time beau.  We also get a cameo by James Stewart as the millionaire who arranges the trip.The best part of the film, however, is Jack Lemmon's presence as the dedicated pilot.  I checked his filmography and I believe this is his sole film appearance in an entirely heroic role.  For those who don't understand why such a great actor would take a role in an Airport sequel, that says it all.  At the time he seemed to be playing one tortured loser or everyman on the edge of a nervous breakdown after another.  Playing a strong hero must have been a real treat and he is obviously enjoying himself here. It's amazing how by simply putting on a fake mustache and carrying himself with authority, Lemmon can pull off such an atypical role and make us remember how bad Charlton Heston really was in Airport 1975.  Unfortunately, we also get a gratuitous, unnecessary cameo by George Kennedy as Joe Patroni, who went from airline troubleshooter in the original, to airline vice-president in the second film, to some kind of airline liaison to Jimmy Stewart here.  But at least he's not as ridiculous here as in The Concorde--Airport '79.  Enough said.As far as the direction, another TV hack (Jerry Jameson) worked on this one, and he at least delivers a competently edited and photographed piece of work.  The visual imagery is sharp and the special effects are actually very good.  (Even the miniature work looks impressive, which wasn't always the case back then--see the aforementioned Airport '79.)  And, as I said before, it helps immeasurably that Jameson and the writers didn't feel the need to add a lot of cornball humor and other emotional hooey to a film that needed to be directed with a straight face in order to work at all.Okay, so Airport '77 has a ridiculous premise and a reputation as a bad movie.  But watch this after The Swarm or When Time Ran Out... and you may find that it's a pretty competent piece of work, and rather entertaining to boot.  You may not even hate yourself for liking it.

That's because the TV showings were purposefully padded to two parts with more than an hour of extra footage that in this case places the characters in much better context than they appear in the theatrical version, (don't get me wrong, it doesn't elevate it to a topnotch story, but at least the narrative makes better sense).  The biggest revelation upon seeing the theatrical cut was how all of George Kennedy's scenes before the crash weren't there any more.Even at it's best, Airport 77 is only par for the course as far as disaster movies go.  The plot is a little more innovative and the rescue scenes of trying to survive and then get the plane raised are more realistic than what we were served up in Airport 1975 with the stewardess flying the plane. Jack Lemmon does succeed as the nominal lead and that helps make one more charitable toward the rest of the supporting cast which is largely wasted in some classic, stereotyped cliched roles.  But towards the end, it starts to drag just a bit.  You can also see the beginnings of Jimmy Stewart's declining health since he's basically forced to play his part as though he were appearing as a guest on the Johnny Carson show instead of making his character more distinctive.The widescreen DVD is worth having but I strongly recommend catching the expanded TV version instead, even if it is panned and scanned.

I hadn't seen the other Airport films, but it's a 1970's disaster movie, so I felt like I knew what to expect. And to a certain extent I was right; the special effects weren't great (although not as bad as they could have been), the clothes were awful, and there were quite a few scenes that came off as unintentionally funny to modern eyes. But other than that, Airport 77 was a supremely enjoyable, highly competent film. I honestly was shocked by how invested I was in the plot and characters. I especially appreciated the depth that the characters were each given (and the fact that you genuinely didn't know who was going to die), as well as the realistic nature of the rescue. Touches like a rekindled love affair between two older characters also added class and realism to the story and was quite refreshing to see, especially considering that in modern action films, old people are basically treated as one step above furniture. The pacing was also excellent, with a plot that moved forward without getting bogged down in extraneous details and filler. Great acting too.There's a lesson here for modern filmmakers; when you're making an action/thriller and don't have unlimited CGI effects and a cast of supermodels, you need to focus on developing a compelling story, with realistic characters and situations that are generally comprehensible to the audience. Airport 77 is not a good movie because of CGI or sexy eye candy; its a good movie because the writer, director and cast did their jobs properly.

Like it ought to be with sequels, the events and accidents are much more disastrous, the rescue operations are much more spectacular and the characters are much more stereotypical. In the first film there was just a tiny sub plot about a suicide bomber on a transcontinental flight, the second was more straightforward with a mid-air collision, but this third film unfolds an ambitious &#x96; albeit slightly grotesque &#x96; plot involving an attempted hijacking, a crash into the Bermuda Triangle and the trapped passengers either drowning or suffocating 100ft below the water surface. Multi-millionaire Philip Stevens gathered a whole posse of eminent people to come to the grand opening of his new museum and arranges for them to travel all together with his private and ultra-luxurious Boeing 747. There are also plenty of valuable paintings and art treasures aboard, which naturally interests a trio of crooks posing as cabin personnel. They sedate the passengers with gas and disappear from the radar, but their plan backfires when the massive aircraft hits an oil rig and crashes into the water. By the time Captain Gallagher comes to his senses, the plane completely sunk and there isn't a control tower that can locate them. Naturally there are several more additional intrigues between the characters aboard the plane, and this time they are actually interesting to behold thanks to the vivid and enthusiast performances. In fact, the top cast prevents the film from resembling too much like an episode of The Love Boat. Speaking of which, every single one of the Airport movies boosts a deeply impressive cast of famous names, but Aiport '77 definitely has my favorite ensemble cast. In a random order of importance, we have Christopher Lee, Joseph Cotton, M. Emmet Walsh, James Stewart, Darren McGavin, Kathleen Quinlan, Jack Lemmon, Robert Foxworth, Olivia De Havilland and Michael Pataki. The role of George Kennedy, the thread running through all four episodes, has been downsized to a cameo appearance, but it's always fun to see him. Some of the players appear in really unusual roles, like horror legends Christopher Lee and Joseph Cotton as honorable and unselfish millionaires. The special effects are also remarkably better than those in the previous installment (1975) and the images of the large inescapable plane slowly filling up with water through cracks and holes are effectively claustrophobic. The Airport cycle has a bad reputation among critics and wannabe intellectual film students, but at least they all guarantee sheer thrills and entertainment.

When I saw this movie the first time when I was little, it frightened me to watch as an airplane gets hijacked in mid-air and ends up crashing in the Bermuda Triangle. And unlike the follow-up picture The Concorde Airport '79, which spent so much time being unintentionally funny, this one has thrilling suspense and some good acting. I think there are good performances turned in by Jack Lemmon, Jimmy Stewart, Brenda Vaccaro, Olivia De Havilland, Joseph Cotten, Darren McGavin, and George Kennedy as part of the all-star cast that's featured here. Only Lee Grant and Christopher Lee are wasted here, with Grant having the honors of the worst written role in the film as a adultress woman and Lee looking bored as her husband. The scene when the plane goes down in the ocean is a pretty scary moment. After the plane submerges under water, the question becomes, will there be a rescue of the passengers in time, or will the plane fill up with water or run out of air before the rescue team gets to them? This is a pretty exciting film. Sure there are a few silly moments here and there (mostly provided by Lee Grant), but Airport '77 is so well made that it didn't bother me. A very good disaster film.

Out of the three Airport films I have seen so far I actually liked this one the best, just. It has my favourite plot of the three with a nice mid-air hi-jacking & then the crashing (didn't he see the oil rig?) & sinking of the 747 (maybe the makers were trying to cross the original Airport with another popular disaster flick of the period The Poseidon Adventure (1972)) & submerged is where it stays until the end with a stark dilemma facing those trapped inside, either suffocate when the air runs out or drown as the 747 floods or if any of the doors are opened & it's a decent idea that could have made for a great little disaster flick but bad unsympathetic character's, dull dialogue, lethargic set-pieces & a real lack of danger or suspense or tension means this is a missed opportunity. While the rather sluggish plot keeps one entertained for 108 odd minutes not that much happens after the plane sinks & there's not as much urgency as I thought there should have been. Even when the Navy become involved things don't pick up that much with a few shots of huge ships & helicopters flying about but there's just something lacking here. George Kennedy as the jinxed airline worker Joe Patroni is back but only gets a couple of scenes & barely even says anything preferring to just look worried in the background.The home video & theatrical version of Airport '77 run 108 minutes while the US TV versions add an extra hour of footage including a new opening credits sequence, many more scenes with George Kennedy as Patroni, flashbacks to flesh out character's, longer rescue scenes & the discovery or another couple of dead bodies including the navigator. While I would like to see this extra footage I am not sure I could sit through a near three hour cut of Airport '77. As expected the film has dated badly with horrible fashions & interior design choices, I will say no more other than the toy plane model effects aren't great either. Along with the other two Airport sequels this takes pride of place in the Razzie Award's Hall of Shame although I can think of lots of worse films than this so I reckon that's a little harsh. The action scenes are a little dull unfortunately, the pace is slow & not much excitement or tension is generated which is a shame as I reckon this could have been a pretty good film if made properly.The production values are alright if nothing spectacular. The acting isn't great, two time Oscar winner Jack Lemmon has said since it was a mistake to star in this, one time Oscar winner James Stewart looks old & frail, also one time Oscar winner Lee Grant looks drunk while Sir Christopher Lee is given little to do & there are plenty of other familiar faces to look out for too.Airport '77 is the most disaster orientated of the three Airport films so far & I liked the ideas behind it even if they were a bit silly, the production & bland direction doesn't help though & a film about a sunken plane just shouldn't be this boring or lethargic.

It was a great time in the 70s to see many old stars get a guest appearance gig in this series Helen Hayes in 1970 in AIRPORT, then the astonishing appearance of Gloria Swanson in AIRPORT 75 and in this outing, the triple treat of James Stewart, Joseph Cotton and Olivia deHavilland... all of course in a cast of 4 generations if you count the kids. AIRPORT 77 has wonderful and obvious special effects from Albert Whitlock, made all the more appealing today since they are all pre computer generated and use delicious glass and matte compilation. Overall, AIRPORT 77 is a good thriller, fun in its '77 way, easily enjoyable if you are kind to its intent of genuinely entertaining you in a most professional major studio way, certainly a production of old Hollywood and certainly very well made. My extra delight in this film is the appearance of the extraordinary Lee Grant. She can make any film watchable and her professional performances in every film she ever appeared lifts the whole event into 'better'. She is one of the most unappreciated actresses of her era, and deserves proper re discovery before she leaves us. AIRPORT 77 is a perfect example of her performance lifting the film... even more than the Navy does in the last reel. Today's younger audiences might also get entertainment value from the rescue beefcake on display in their tiny wet tight shorts, something I missed 31 years ago.

There is allot of familiar faces and you will catch yourself mumbling OH I REMEMBER THEMIf your clamoring to watch an AIRPORT STYLE disaster movie then avoid this one and watch any of the others.

Robert Foxworth's tricky disguise is neatly handled, as are preparations for a take-over of the plane once it's airborne. But as soon as the plane crashes and lands below the surface, the plot becomes waterlogged with too many unrealistic soapopera sub-plots involving an extremely uninteresting cast of characters.Jack Lemmon was a last minute replacement for a Charlton Heston-like hero role and he and Brenda Vaccaro actually do a good job of emoting. Not much else can be said for the rest of the cast--Christopher Lee, Lee Grant (strident and over-the-top as a sarcastic, slightly tipsy wife), Olivia de Havilland and Joseph Cotten as reunited lovers, Darren McGavin, Kathleen Quinlan and others, left to the mercy of a witless script.The rescue operation is by far the most exciting and credible part of the whole story, making the implausible seem almost plausible. Only diehard fans of this kind of 'Airport' film will enjoy watching some of Hollywood's finest wallow in this awkwardly staged disaster epic.

I was moved to see this film because of its wonderful cast with actors as Joseph Cotten, Christopher Dracula Lee, James Stewart, Jack Lemmon, and the excellent actress Olivia De Havilland. It is a fictitious film with a lot of imagination, but the most exciting one in the whole serial of Airport films. Here Lemmon as a pilot of the plane becomes the hero also as a good swimmer, who saved most part of the passengers. That plane was really good to flight, it was like a luxury flying bar with all comfort necessary. It would be good to be seen by all those big and famous airlines from Europe and North America, which try each time to put more and more passengers in smaller spaces. Happy also to know that at least US has the capacity to conduct such rescue actions as the one shown here.      "},{"Title":"¡Excellent movie.

Airport '79 - 1979) did have some kind of balanced concentration on the main accident and the characters as well. Later on the characters themes gone down to the extent that they became separated lines in muddled scenes without a problem and its solution or even one character with a purgation at the end to step aside for the disaster itself as the main real problem, and its solutions, besides that tiny pieces of drama were acted by bunch of super stars ! So the frustration would be more stronger ! Therefore in here don't you wait to be dazzled by the flashy exciting plane's situation in the water and the good scenes of the grand cast too.. No my dear friends.. Just wait for the flashy exciting plane's situation ONLY! Here is a little advice (or a warning !) for you  if you don't like this one then don't you ever go and watch (The Concorde ... Airport '79 - 1979) it's the worst of the worst ! Because if in the early ones we've got action and drama, and in ones like (Airport '77) we've got action and little drama, I promise you that last one doesn't have any action or drama !! It's a disaster movie by all means which put the very end of the whole era, giving finally the perfect chance for the parody to appear and hit hard  (Airplane! - 1980).

I felt like I was in a classroom watching how our Navy performs rescues at sea. I liked seeing that the engines have fire extinguishers. I guess I should have figured that out before, but I never thought about it. Using a 747 to transport valuable old paintings with very little security is odd and not realistic. The acting was pretty good, since they're mostly seasoned professionals, but if you're going to stretch so far from what would most likely happen, it should be more like a fantasy, comical, etc. Everything was taken too seriously. At least the movie had Felix Ungar as pilot, with Buck Rogers, the night stalker, and Dracula also on board. The movie was filled with well known faces. I understand that Hollywood has to exaggerate a bit for drama, but it does hurt the quality of a movie when a serious subject is made into a caricature. That's why I said it should have been more comical. My pet peeve with movies about airline travel is that everybody just casually moves about. They walk around with drinks, setting them down and picking them up 5 minutes later, just as if they're in a building or something, and acting as if turbulence just doesn't exist. Also, I know it's a disaster movie, but suspense doesn't have to include a 30 second crash after hitting something. Anyway, the skilled actors and actresses keep this weak script from having been made into a movie that got canned after it's first screening. I like Lee Grant, but it was fun to watch a psychotic person get decked...)

Airport '77 is a 1977 disaster film and second sequel in the Airport franchise. The film starred a number of veteran actors, including Jack Lemmon, James Stewart, Joseph Cotten, Christopher Lee and Olivia de Havilland. Like its predecessors, Airport '77 was a box office hit earning US $30 million the film marked the series' progression into unrealistic story events. Summary A privately owned luxury Boeing 747, Stevens' Flight 23 (call sign two-three sierra heavy) complete with piano bar, office, and bedroom, is used to ferry invited guests to an estate owned by wealthy philanthropist Philip Stevens (James Stewart). Valuable artwork of the Stevens' private collection is also onboard the jetliner, to be eventually displayed in his new museum. Such a collection motivates a group of thieves led by co-pilot Bob Chambers (Robert Foxworth) to hijack the aircraft in the hopes of landing it on an abandoned airfield on St. George Island. Once Captain Don Gallagher (Jack Lemmon) leaves the cockpit, the hijacker's plans go into motion. A sleeping gas is released into the cabin and the passengers lose consciousness. Knocking out the flight engineer, Chambers puts the plan in motion, and Stevens' Flight 23 disappears into the Bermuda Triangle. Descending to virtual wave-top altitude, Flight 23 heads into a fog bank, reducing visibility to less than a mile. Minutes later, a large offshore drilling platform emerges from the haze, Flight 23 heading straight for it at close to 600 knots. Chambers pulls back on the yoke in a banking left turn but the engine number 4 clips the derrick, causing the engine to catch fire. Chambers immediately hits the fire-extinguishing button and flames are shortly extinguished. However, because the aircraft is at such a low altitude, the sudden loss of airspeed threatens to stall the airplane. As the engine reignites, Chambers is forced to use another fire-suppression bottle. However, by this time, the aircraft stall alarm goes off and the aircraft's tail hits the water. By this time all the passengers wake up, and most start to scream and panic. Chambers is able to pull up, but soon the plane's right wing hits the water again, and the plane lifts into the air for another moment, then hitting the water again. Because of the impact being so hard, the plane becomes grounded in the ocean. Eventually the plane begins to slip beneath the waves. Questions What cause this plane to slam into the ocean? What is the bottom of the ocean like? Can the ground under the ocean support a plane of that size? How many passengers are dead and how many are alive? How far of course did the plane go? Can the Navy help find this plane and if so how are they going to get the plane to rise to the surface. My thoughts on this movie This movie wasn't as good as the other two in this series. The action wasn't as good either. It wasn't a bad movie because it does keep your interest. However as far as star power goes this movie didn't have as much as the last one. Outside of James Stewart, there were no well-known actors or actresses. Therefore, I give this picture 6 weasel stars and hope that Airport 79 is better. "}]
