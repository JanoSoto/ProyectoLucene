It was a letdown from its amazing predecessor.  I knew its reputation as an unworthy sequel, but I still realized there was something good about it, something I had never heard from other people's points of view.It wasn't until some time later when I watched the series a second time that I noticed what it was.Those who think MMBT is not as exciting as The Road Warrior would be right. But those that think MMBT sucks because it is not as exciting as The Road Warrior would be missing the point.  What makes MMBT a worthy sequel is its way of establishing a greater scope of the setting the series takes place in.  The dredges of civilization were what set the stage for the series in the original Mad Max.  The barren world of desert wastelands and sparse outposts take the idea of a post-apocalyptic world one step further in The Road Warrior.  A squalid setting such as Bartertown and an oasis where the tribe of children lived in MMBT once again builds on the elaborate fantasy that makes the series as popular as it is.  The final, chilling realization of just what became of civilization in the closing moments of the movie are more than enough explanation as to why the the world the viewer sees in the trilogy is the way it is.I was too young when I first saw MMBT to understand this.  It wouldn't be until I saw it again some time later, with more movie-viewing experience under my belt that I realized that what makes Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome tick is not action set pieces, but a far more subtle approach of atmospheric setting.

It is maybe a little more Hollywood (which is a bad thing) than the first two. The music is overbearing at times, and some of the attempts at jokes were very cheap and American blockbusterish.One of the main faults that has to be sited with this one is that the last thirty minutes or so are basically taken straight from The Road  Warrior. The car chase and then the speech about how a stranger helped them establish a new society were taken right out of the 2nd installment.It still is very creative, and the action has a wonderful momentum. I love the whole society that finds Max in the desert. I loved the recitation of their foundation, and I loved their dialect. I loved Masterblaster.

This movie starts out top-notch, and it seems like it's going to be a superb follow up to the brilliant Road Warrior, and then about halfway through it turns into friggin' Peter Pan meets Lord of the Flies! Mel Gibson was great in this film, and working as hard as he could to make it work. Tina Turner was adequate, but not spectacular.

The actors' performances are perfectly adequate for the action, and the chase scenes bear all the hallmarks of Miller's craftsmanship (which contemporary directors should seriously consider studying and revitalizing.) You just won't see any arrow-riddled bodies slamming into the pavement at 60 mph or watch manned motorcycles sucked under the wheels of a big-rig. This one is about the kids.

Even though it takes place in an even bleaker future, the filmmakers decided to line their pockets even further by making this one family friendly (i.e. P.G.-13). What made the other films gritty and nihilistic is missing from this film.  Only a few spots but other than that it's just other one of those sequels that morphed into a more mainstream movie (i.e Robocop 3).  Needless to say I was very disappointed because when I was much younger I was a huge Mad Max mark.The story takes place years after the events that transpired in part two. Max is content with his life out in the wastelands. But one day, the fates would appear.  Someone has robbed him of his caravan and his old souped up vehicle (sadly no longer in running condition). When he recovers he finds that all roads lead to one of the last vestiges of civilization, an arm pit called Bartertown.  Whilst in Bartertown Max finds the person who cold cocked him but his unable to do anything about it.  So, after a brief scuffle with the local authorities Max is taken to meet the mayor of Bartertown Aunt Enity (Tina Turner).  After a brief display of his talents, Enity and Max strike a deal....Like the other films, the world of Pro Wrestling has taken several themes and characters from this movie (i.e. The Thunderdome and The Master Blasters, etc..).  Many knock-offs and wannabes have spawn off of this one as well.  It even started up a sub-genre, children living in a post-apocalyptic society films.

The dreadful score matches the cartoon heart of the film, it seems that the makers didn't really know what to do with the amount of cash given to make this third and thankfully last instalment. Sure the stunts are spot on to be expected by now, and of course Miller manages to paint a barren desert landscape by purely lifting from what he has done before. Yet he clearly struggled for fresh ideas with the action since The Road Warrior's crowning glory of the Petrol Tanker pursuit is replicated here, only he uses a train instead!!.It's just a very poor show that may have seemed like an ambitious turn of events back in the mid 1980s; but when viewing the three films together now, Thunderdome just comes across as a director losing his edgy approach whilst sadly getting caught between the mix of comedy and fantasy action. And the truth is that neither of those genre slants would have worked singularly, in the context of this series, anyway. I give the film 3/10 purely for one real good Thunderdome fight sequence, while the stunt men here deserve some credit at the very least. But this is the third time I have tried to like this film, and as glutton for punishment as I undoubtedly am, I wont be trying again, ever.

SPOILERS AHEAD!In the beginning was the era of the White Line nightmare, the collapse of civilisation as a few struggled to keep law and order against the rising tide of anarchy.  That was Mad Max the original movie.Then came Mad Max 2 (The Road Warrior) and the story moved on, the struggle to survive after the collapse that had begun in the era of the first film.Beyond Thunderdome attempts to bring the saga full circle as some resemblance of civilisation and organisation begins to rise from the ashes and the cities become populated once again, hopefully setting the scene for the battles and action in the forthcoming Fury Road.Thunderdome does suffer from a slight 'Hollywoodisation' and many will recognise a few elements straight out of the action movie handbook probably at the insistence of the studio.However the spirit of Mad Max is still there, the struggle to survive against the odds in the ever changing world.  Many have bemoaned the lack of decent car chases in the same way as the previous two films, which is understandable, however it must be remembered that this is fifteen years after the fall of civilisation and oil is non-existent practically.A chase between a train (we will skip over the nicely maintained track myster!) and various bespoke vehicles is a bit of a rehash of the excellent chase from Road Warrior but fills the bill.  It does appear a little stilted and short though as though there was meant to be more of it but we will probably never know.Annoyingly Brian May who did the amazing soundtrack for the first two Max films was passed over here in favour of Maurice Jarre (Studio insistence?) However he still manages a good soundtrack here (sadly missing several key sections on the CD of the music).  Tina Turner does the contractual obligation of most films post 1985 by providing opening and closing songs.Overall the performances are good as usual from Mel Gibson as our slightly reluctant hero.  Tina Turner lords it up for all she can get as Auntie, the leader of Bartertown with the usual supporting cast of henchmen and loonies in weird outfits driving even weirder machines!Of the supporting characters, Helen Buday was excellent as the young warrior princess Savannah Nix which makes it a shame she has not done more film work, Robert Grubb as Pigkiller was a character I felt needed more explanation and development whilst Bruce Spence is back as a similar (although apparently different!) character to his Gyrocaptain from The Road Warrior.Nothing however compares with the quite simply stunning closing sequence with the ruins of Sydney (Harbour Bridge, Opera House, etc) that was achieved with amazing accuracy using real models - who needs CGI?This and the other Mad Max films do deserve decent DVD releases though with load of extras, the full soundtrack and deleted scenes I feel if they are to bring any justice to them.  Hopefully with the new Fury Road on the way, someone at Warner Bros DVD Dept might take the hint?So with Savannah closing with her 'tell' we see Max set off into the wasteland sunset hopefully to return in Mad Max 4 - Fury Road.

Bartertown may be ruled above ground by Aunty Entity but the real owner is Master Blaster &#150; a team of two men who control the power supply. In exchange for his goods, Aunty offers Max a deal where he will challenge Blaster to a fight in the town's duelling arena and kill him &#150;thus removing the muscle and putting Master under Aunty's control. Max accepts, although he rightly suspects that he will be the next to be betrayed.At least one reviewer on this site has said that the reason people dislike this film is because it is about the start of a new world whereas the other two Mad Max films were about the end of the world as we know it. Sadly I believe he is mistaken because I think the reason people dislike this film is because it is messy, excessive, unconvincing (even within the apocalyptic situation it makes no sense) and just isn't really any good. The plot swings between an excessive violent society at the start, to a child colony in the middle to a big noisy chase scene right at the end. In terms of the narrative that connects this all, don't worry about that because it doesn't really work and just feels very episodic throughout &#150; making it messy and uninteresting. It is unconvincing and, although I accept that the entire film is fantasy, you gotta wonder where all the excesses and such came from and how we were supposed to buy into it; hell, a fuel blockade by lorry drivers brought the UK to its knees a few years ago but yet we're suppose to believe this? The apocalyptic here lacks imagination and just feels like the sort of thing that exists in an art director's mind rather than something that convinces.The episodic feel isn't helped by the rambling, pointless dialogue associated with the children &#150; it tries to have a mysticism that nothing else in the film has worked to deserve; however it could be helped by developing Max better. If he was a strong lynch pin holding all these bits and pieces together then it would matter less but he isn't &#150; he is just a grunting rock that doesn't really have a character to speak of and I had little or no interest in him at all &#150; even when he becomes caring and sharing I didn't care because I had had nothing to work with up till that point. Turner is not terrible but she doesn't really act and just sort of swans around in an unconvincing manner. In that regard she is like the majority of the cast, who don't really give the performances &#150; whether it e the clunky child actors or the grunting brutes that are just stunt fodder. The stunts are OK and the final chase provides some distraction but without really caring about the plot or the characters, I found it hard to get into any action.Overall a disappointing film whose core failing is the lack of a convincing new world. The film feels episodic and lacks anything to hold it together. Throwing a lot of cars around at the end does provide some distraction but by then it was too late for me and the whole thing was clunky, pointless and surprisingly uninteresting.

Though I'm not an Aussie myself, I've become attuned to some notions that seem peculiar to the Australian spirit. Which of those that are picked out by a viewer are what tells you who they are.For me, this one is the one I like the best. Its reputed to have been influenced by Kurosawa samurai films and their derivative spaghetti westerns. But when I see this one, I see an Australian Lawrence of Arabia. I almost see every scene as something from Lean's epic filtered through different Ox prisms deliberate looseness, the perspective of the saved rather than the savior, the notion of distance, rugged children, Aboriginal myths, totemic kinship, civilization via barter, laws.But we keep Lean's desert, train, sun, tribal release and matters of energy. We keep the playing fast with religious superstitions and mob dynamics. We even keep the tent.What's added isn't much a cargo cult backstory and an American woman who is notable for how ill suited she is for her surroundings. A couple of Mel's scowls.

Max ends up losing absolutely everything civilized in his life -- everything. Not a drop of heart's blood is spared Max as he rips himself apart, trying to free himself of the chains and bonds of civilization in order to take revenge on the men who stole his world away. When it's all done, he wanders away from absolutely everything.Mel Gibson's Max character returns in Road Warrior, where the remnant of civilization has been left behind in favor of complete anarchy in the middle of the desert where an oil well refinery is the strongly-defended holdout of some kind of corporate collective, against growing bands of interested investors who would like to trade bullets and lives for the thinning lifeblood of petroleum. The leader of the wackos is absolutely cartoonish, sort of a psychotic pro-wrestler genius, while the leader of the recluses is dripping with ignorance and a desperate need to maintain his egotism. Every single person knows why they are in that desert, fighting -- because they can't get away from the the vehicles and the combustion. It's everything in their life. The distance between meals and drinks is dozens of miles. The distance to the nearest real civilization is not even survivable. Those who hold the vehicles hold the supreme power. Max delivers the oil-barons into salvation, but at a heavy loss, then once again wanders away from all that has come to pass.Finally Max, come into his own with a well-outfitted gravy train, is wandering the desert apparently finally convinced that he is the beacon of civilization, not some building or crowd. His delusion is sorely broken right at the beginning of the movie, and with nothing but his boots and a flute he's forced to rejoin humanity, but why we aren't exactly sure. He's been through it before and he knows what will happen, but still he saunters into Bartertown where he meets the sexy Auntie Entity (Tina Turner) who rules with elegance and ferocity, and agrees to scratch her back if she'll rub his.Tina Turner's delivery as Aunty Entity is passionate. When she is stood off by the uppity Master-Blaster, you can hear the hurt pride in her voice as she admits her humility. And when the real loser of Thunderdome is swiftly decided, you can see the fear in her eyes as everything, all the orders of civility she has cherished and sacrificed who knows what for, falls apart right under her hands. As the chaos grows, she looks above for guidance but sees only the mindless crowd, just as desperate as she and even more powerless. Her delivery from the middle of thunderdome is moving, but short compared to the brotherly storytelling of the very artful Dr. Dealgood (Edwin Hodgeman.) Nevertheless, what small part Turner is given to play is played from the bottom of her heart and you are thoroughly convinced that she is who she portrays. Her chain-mail suit could have been a little more transparent, though. The rest of the characters in Bartertown, some recognizable from the earlier films, are real in a faery-tale sort of way that seems to follow naturally behind the previous films in Mad Max, the characters' selves were all dying like lights on their way to burning out; in Road Warrior, their selves were completely gone, wasted with nothing but animal behaviors left; in Thunderdome's Bartertown, the desolation of the human inner being has proved to be merely a loss of luxury and comfort, and we see that deep inside these layers of modern dross most man and women really are larger than life, in their hopes and dreams and their achievements. Max, unable to abandon life on his own this time around, is forced out into the desert wilderness to die.We soon see the inherent human worth proved again in Thunderdome's Crack in the Earth, where little people, who never grew up with the bleak realities of technology and its apocalyptic inevitabilities as anything but faery-tales, are all as large of life as nature can provide for. The gorgeous Suzannah (Helen Buday, rhymes with boo tay,) drags Max back into life in a veritable Garden of Eden where children and children's' children, who are absolutely hysterical, spend every day of their lives in summer-camp dreamland. Finally, Max chooses not to abandon but to stay around and support -- whether because he's too tired to fight any more, or because he's learned to see a good thing when he's got it and not drop it for something better, it's hard to say -- maybe this is where he was on his way to in the first place. And yet none of this matters. Somehow, once again, humanity goes wrong over the same superstitions and arrogance as before, and a schism in the valley dwellers leads to calamity and a reconciliation with the recent past. Max decides to abandon the valley after all, proving finally that he really, truly is MAD, sacrificing everything to return one more time to the truth that he and every man carries his best civilization with him wherever he goes.

Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome represents salvation, for Max and the rest of the world.In some aspects, Beyond Thunderdome is the best of the trilogy.

The first part of the movie (taking place in Barter Town) with Tina Turner's character is considerably less interesting. Still entertaining, but without much credibility, partly due to some bad overacting and partly because of the cartoon characters. I know, much is possible in this universe, but even here you can go too far. But, it was great to see Bruce Spence back in the air, now as a different character. Turner's music at the beginning and end of the film is a nice addition too.

In the Road Warrior, there was little need to explore in great detail the reasons as for why things went to hell. That film's explaining was done through the use of violent action sequences and it is one my favorite movies of all time. This film appears to be more thought provoking, which normally I would embrace in film yet in this movie it leads to too much talk and not enough action (good action anyways).One thing I did enjoy and continue to enjoy about this story is the different cultures and ways of life that we are exposed to. I have no idea what director George Miller was doing when he dreamed up this post-apocalyptic world that operates under its own set of primitive rules but he has created a world that is every bit as interesting as Star Wars. Bartertown and Thunderdome are some of the greatest ideas ever conceived for a film. The battle inside the domed arena is one I don't think I'll ever forget. I also enjoyed being introduced to a completely different subgroup consisting of children that have survived in a lush, green strip of forest that has a source of water.However, it is here where coincidently things get hampered by childish- like action. The rest of the movie's action scenes are like something I would expect to see in Ghostbusters or Indiana Jones. Which would be fine if this film didn't take itself so seriously in the early goings of the story. The final sequence is truly disappointing because it attempts to go for too much comical action and it just can't compete with the final chase in the Road Warrior. I would still recommend this film to those who enjoy sci-fi or action movies but beware of its flaws.

Max has his vehicle and supplies stolen by Jebediah the Pilot (Bruce Spence), so he is forced to wander barefoot through the desert until he comes across a community dubbed Bartertown, a place where you can trade anything or anyone.Like the vehicles in the world of Mad Max, Bartertown is hammered together from spare parts. It is ruled by Aunty Entity (Tina Turner), who is locked in a constant power-struggle with Master Blaster, a grotesque tag-team who overlooks the pits below the town where pigs are farmed and harvested for methane gas. Master is a dwarf played by Angelo Rossitto who rides on the back of Blaster, a giant of a man who wears a huge concealing helmet, and is played by Paul Larsson. Master Blaster may be George Miller's most interesting creation, and as Max inevitably faces Blaster is the arena known as the Thunderdome - where all quarrels are concluded as two men enter but only one leaves - one of the most inventive scraps in cinema history plays out, as they bounce at each other on huge elastic bands and hack at each other with all manners of weapons.Yet that is only half of the film. Miller resigned himself to just directing the action scenes following the tragic death of his friend and location scout Byron Kennedy, so the rest of the film was put in the hands of George Ogilvie. Narrowly escaping Bartertown with his life, Max discovers the young survivors of a plane crash who has developed their own little tribal society, and it's here that the film goes a bit Peter Pan. Whether this was down to Miller's absence or not - Beyond Thunderdome lacks the edge of its predecessors, occasionally dipping into traditional mainstream fantasy fare and losing focus of its antagonists motivation. Still, the film delivers where expected - the action scenes. Again we get a tanker being chased down by an army of baddies in doomsday vehicle's, and again we are treated to some awe-inspiring stunts that hold up even today. It's the weakest of the original trilogy but hugely entertaining stuff.

We do see a bit more of the Max world in this place but not in any way I care for. It feels like this part was bolted on when they decided to turn a separate script into a Max movie.No, I'm oddly captivated by the Lord of the Flies portion. I see glimmers of magic in the way the narrative of something that crashed from the skies one day has been preserved in the minds of kids, the way it's revealed through a screen that frames remnants of half- remembered story, the chorus of awestruck kids for whom all of this has profound meaning.It does open up a window to a whole swathe of Max world but this time with deep feeling, as myth the kids have vowed to keep in memory and bide their time for. Sure, we are in Goonies territory and again in the end with the city, but there's hushed yearning here, an almost Biblical kind.The rest is in the chase, a train this time, briefer than usual and over before it really exhilarates, as if more by obligation than keenness for it. They would eventually build a whole other film around it, extending it to an entire circus around the rig, but that would have to wait for 30 years.

He then stumbles upon a group of orphans, the only survivors of a plane crash during the nuclear war and with their help he returns to Bartertown.Apart from the fact the entire movie was watered down and just seemed like a kids fantasy movie, there was really nothing spectacular to write about the movie. The train-truck pursuit had the only thing going for it but that was about it.I can't fault Mel Gibson here and Tina Turner does a decent job as the flamboyant Aunty Entity. Keep an eye out for other actors in the movie such as Angry Anderson, the late Frank Thring, Bruce Spence who returns as a different character, George Spartels (Play School), and a really young Justine Clarke (also from Play School fame as well as a multitude of Australian shows and movies).I don't know what director George Miller was thinking with Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. The end result is very underwhelming which saw the trilogy come to an end with a whimper. Thankfully the Mad Max series was spectacularly resurrected with Mad Max Fury Road (2015) which saw Tom Hardy take over the coveted role as Max Rockatansky.True action fans and fans of the Mad Max movies should only really consider the first two Mad Max movies as classics, and if they want to consider the fourth movie they can. The third movie was a disappointment.5/10.

It really feels so different compared to previous two , that you might think somebody else except George Miller directed it. Gone is the gritty atmosphere and violence . Mad Max 3 is much more lighthearted , funny and less violent (there is action , but barely any blood). It feels like a family friendly entertainment, especially with such story .It reminds me of something that could appear in Spielberg movie . I don't know , maybe they were going for wider audience with this one ? That would probably explain the appearance of Tina Turner , who not only sings two songs , but also acts . The songs - &#x84;One of the living and the much better known &#x84;We don't need another hero (Thunderdome) are really good . Her performance also is nice , so one can't complain that Tina destroyed the movie . She's actually one of the strongest points of it.The story has a heart , just like the other two movies , but it doesn't affect you so much like it should . The movie is definitely enjoyable , despite it's sometimes silly . Mel Gibson seems to be a little lost in this one , but he still delivers good performance . The art &#x96; direction is quite impressive . The music by Maurice Jarre is magnificent . It was also good to see a old face back.The problem lies in the fact that without it's dark and gritty atmosphere Mad Max 3 loses a lot . The direction is not as sharp as before. Also , the story is rather simple and predictable. And the ending seems like We have to end this somehow. If you seen the movie you will know what I mean.Still , it's not a bad farewell to Mad Max , compared to some other sequels (Matrix sequels). I give it 5/10.

George Miller took the road-action aspect of the first two films - the best part - and threw it out the window in this movie.The end of Mad Max 2 was ambiguous yet still had great closure - a good way the series could have ended instead of moving onto this garbage. As always Max finds himself among a community of people in this post-apocalyptic world, looking for what he needs and nothing more. The people there need his help to rebel against the team of master and blaster. The title comes from Max and Blaster fighting to the death in a cage called Thunderdome. Max is extradited from the community (by a wheel of consequences - really??) after not killing Blaster, which was part of a deal he made. He meets up with a different community that happens to have a huge child to adult ratio, almost to a level like the one in Hook by Spielberg. He is forced to help them since they worship him as if he was a hero they all know and love.Road-action is slightly present in the third act, but it is more ridiculous than in the first two films, so it is not really worth discussing. This film was boring, almost cartoonish, and was a terrible third installment. Third installments are extreme hits or extreme misses, and this was a miss.

This film just did not have the feeling of the first two and seemed like it had been absolved into the eighties (part of which may have to do with the casting of Tina Turner.) A scattered plot and an absence of the thrills felt in earlier chapters of this saga make this film much less enjoyable, and frankly, not a very good movie.In this edition of the trilogy, Max finds himself banished from a dystopian city called Bartertown after refusing to kill a man in an arena called the Thunderdome. Left for dead in the desert, he is found by a band of children who believe he is a godly figure. It's kind of hard to really explain what happens next, because the plot doesn't seem to know where it's going, but somehow they all end up invading Bartertown. The plot itself is where the film runs into the most trouble. It's very hard at times to figure out where the hell this thing is going and what it is trying to say. The film also does not contain the valuable action sequences found in the first two. It does have a somewhat nice sequence near the end, but it's also overrun by over-used, unfunny attempts at comedy. Speaking of the end, it kind of give us the what the hell?, unsatisfied feeling. Mel Gibson still plays Max well, and Tina Turner really isn't too bad as the villain, but they can't replace the genuineness that somehow is lost from the series in this installment. The film is either not weird enough, or just plain goofy instead of weird. Either way, it is not effective by any means.George Miller gave us an intriguing little action film in Mad Max, as well as a classic with The Road Warrior. But unfortunately, Beyond Thunderdome is a misfire. Hell, I'm not even sure why they went with that title, as I didn't find Thunderdome to be very essential to the film itself. Maybe I just missed something, but I think a more suitable title for this film is Sort-of-Mad Max and the Land of Misfit Children.

There's a wave of wow, we got this far? on part of the filmmakers and a wave of the I can't believe they're making another one on the audience, and, understandably, filmmakers and studios try to see if they can take the series in a different direction once making it a trilogy. The problem is that, with this change, while certain admiration comes into play for risk, the change in direction can often squander or lessen what was already built from the previous films and solidify the decision for moviegoers not to seek out any more films from that franchise. It happened with the Child's Play franchise and the Halloween franchise, and unfortunately, it had to happen with Mad Max.The series, in my eyes, was never an amazing one, but had certain appeal. The first film took the bare basics of action filmmaking and predicated a frightening, if somewhat slight, dystopian story on the large canvas of a desert. Its sequel, however, kicked itself into high gear, formally asserting Mel Gibson's titular character as an action hero. The third film, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, takes a Return of the Jedi-style approach to the sequel, softening it a bit, decorating it in costumes, trying something completely different, and ultimately, leaving divided reactions in its rear-view.What was once a series about suspense and disorder in the middle of nowhere has descended into a film that takes the formula of an epic or a classic warrior tale with little effect. Beyond Thunderdome morphs into a film of silly costumes and scenery-chewing fluff rather than capitalizing off of what made the franchise so unique and, often times, quite mesmerizing.Gibson returns in the titular role, this time exiled into the desert by Aunty Entity (Tina Turner), the ruler of Bartertown. While wandering through the desert, again, trying to remain alive and alert in a sea of chaos and disorder, Max stumbles upon the crashsite of a Boeing 747. The people inside the airplane are members of a Melanesian Cargo cult, many of whom children who act in primal behaviors. After protecting the villagers in the previous film, Max confronts himself in order to try and maintain order amongst the people and protect them, specifically the children, from the dangers of the gangs that lurk in the desert.Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome feels like a film that managed to escape the control of George Miller. The film feels hijacked by greater Hollywood forces, who, in turn, minimized the violence, turned down darker themes, and created a film much more concerned with the portrayal of people than the dangers that lurk in the desert. That would be understandable if the film wasn't burdened by a general sense of disconnect. Little human or character interest can be obtained from these characters, and Max feels as if he has transcended the realm of being an enigma to a completely artificial character, especially when cloaked in ridiculous costumes.At this point, the franchise's different direction, equipped with more light-hearted scenes than the first two films and, for a while, what seems like low stakes suspense, especially in the middle portion of the film, does what I feared it would do and that's take it off course in hopes this particular move would pave the way for greatness. Unfortunately, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome suffers under the weight of its own ambitions and ideas, effectively creating something out of an original property that wasn't there to begin with. I'm sure if you told the Max from the first film he'd end up in the situations he finds himself in in this film, he'd laugh at you.Starring Mel Gibson and Tina Turner. Directed by George Miller.

Look, a lot of people seemed not to have liked this particular movie, but this was actually the first Mad Max that I had seen, and it is also the first that was actually a big budget version.It has been fifteen years since the previous movie and Max is still a loner, but this time he is without a car, most likely because petrol is simply impossible to get. After being ambushed by a guy in a plane (who is identifical to the guy in the plane from the second movie) he is left to wonder the desert on foot, but the guy in the plane is not that smart, because Max is able to follow the tracks to Bartertown, where is gets into fights, thrown into an arena known as the Thunderdome, and then is sent back out into the desert where he is rescued by a group of children who are waiting for the return of Captain Walker, a messiah like figure from the past.Where the first movie was set at the brink of social collapse, and the second one after the said collapse, Mad Max Three has come full circle to the point where society is beginning to bring itself back together. Gone are the roving gangs, as they have now formed colonies that are governed by laws, even if they are the law of a dictator. Even more so we have groups within the colonies fighting for control.Like in the second movie, there is also the colonies of innocents, but this colony is sheltered from the rest of the world, living in an oasis hidden in the desert. They have food and they have water, but what they also have are stories that have been passed down for them to remember. They have not become savages as is suggested in Lord of the Flies, rather the stories have given them not only a semblance of civilisation, but also hope in a future. In a way it is a contrast between the society of Barter town, where law may be brute force, but it is still law, and that of the oasis, which is in essence the land of a noble savage.The problem with this film is that there does not seem to be much of a direction and there is even less of a plot. Some have said that the first part of the film is really good, but it seems like once Max returns to Bartertown the director and writer simply ran out of ideas and decided to rehash Mad Max 2 (and I must admit that the chases in both movies are very similar, it is just that the third one had a bigger budget to play with). Even then, the fact that a perfectly perserved railway literally appears out of nowhere also completely baffles me. However, if there is one thing I can say about this movie, it is that it has a classic cinema moment, namely after Angry Anderson's character dies, we see his hand hanging out of the wreckage, the hand shudder, and in a final act of defiance, flips the birdy. However, having Auntie (Tina Turner), after chasing them across the desert, salute him, and say goodbye warrior, seems a little odd (but that is probably because she had been defeated in that the little man, Master, had escaped).

With all the cruelty, action and inhuman behavior sipped out in this Mad Max movie, Thunderdome was just a movie I think was better off left on the shelf for the future when a good story will be available.The movie boasts of a wonderful action sequence when it comes to the Thunderdome fight scene, where Max takes on Blaster. The avenue for the fight was set up in a circus like way and the tools for destruction were scattered everywhere in the dome.Mad Max 3 Thunderdome was released in 1985 as a post-apocalyptic film. It is directed by George Miller, who also directed the first two prequels to the movie.The movie plot has our protagonist Max, traveling through the wasteland after the nuclear war has rid the world of all normal civilization. He got robbed and lost all his belongings as he travelled the desert. He followed the robbers to Bartertown, a city on the edge of the desert that has managed to retain some technology.There he got involved in a power struggle between the woman who runs the town Aunty (Tina Turner) and the brains of the town Master.When he (Max) refuses to kill Master's henchman Blaster based on a deal he struck with Aunty, he got exiled into the desert where he was rescued by some children who believe he was the man there were waiting for, coming to take them back to civilization.When Max tells them there is no civilization left, some of the children decided to go seek it out on their own. Now Max has to go save them from the clutches of Bartertown.Just like its predecessors Thunderdome had a chase sequence which was more of a bore compared to the one in Mad Max The Road Warrior. Also Bruce Spence, who played the Gyro Captain in Mad Max 2 The Road Warrior plays Jedediah, a different character who robs Max at the start of the film; don't be confused because both use flying machines.The children in the movie were more annoying than there were planned to be and I didn't feel sad for them because they were just annoying and the way they dressed reminded me of the Lost Boys in Peter Pan.The thing that I like most is that (seeing this for the first time) Tina Turner had a role in this movie and the song We don't need another hero was one of the soundtracks in this movie.There is going to be a Mad Max 4, but sadly the baton has been passed to Tom Hardy (played Bane in The Dark Knight Rises 2012 and he was also in Lawless 2012) George Miller also will be involved in directing this new Mad Max, whose budget is 5 times more than the combined budget of the first three Mad Max movies.Well, Thunderdome is something to see when all other movie options have been satisfied.www.lagsreviews.com "},{"Title":"A Great Opportunity Missed","Date":"18 May 2012","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" The first 30 minutes of this movie are utterly mesmerizing, the bleak post-apocalyptic setting was captivating in its chaotic detail and rich gritty texture, the harsh reality of this insane self-destructive world really draws you in.

With that you can pull off the completely outrageous.  Road Warrior managed to do exactly that.  Bartertown felt like a collection of cool ideas just tossed together without ever being integrated into believability.  Plus, it reminded me too much of A Boy and His Dog.

An utterly believable proto-culture being born.  Believable because of the intense seriousness of the young actors.  Not only did they take their roles seriously as actors, but the characters the older kids played also took their leadership roles so very seriously.

The dastardly PG-13 rating and the ludicrous casting of then huge pop star Tina Turner only help to dilute a script that already had little to do with its main character.Mel Gibson returns once again to play Max Rockatansky, the drifter who endlessly wanders through a post-apocalyptic Australia and every now and then is forced to defend himself and his property from other scavengers. In this film's opening scene, he is robbed of his derelict vehicle and a team of camels by the guy who played the gyro captain in Mad Max 2. It is a typically annoying element of this film that we are not sure if he is in fact the same character, or just a new meditation of that original character. Max would seemingly be able to recognize him in an instant, yet there is only a vague familiarity when they meet up later in the film. Anyway, it is the same actor. Max tracks him down to a futuristic scummy civilization known as Batertown. In this vestige of civilization, people trade whatever they have for whatever they need. The town is seemingly run by Tina Turner's Aunty character, yet once Max gets inside, we find that she has a rival within the community. This rival, known as Master/Blaster is perhaps one of the more interesting characters of the entire series. To sum things up, Max makes a deal. He doesn't exactly follow through with it. He is exiled to the desert where he meets a group of plane crash survivors who think he's the chosen one to lead them back to society. Until he can fulfill this prophecy, the group will have to deal with those who run Bartertown and escape them once again.That plot is convoluted to say the least, but with all that is going on it actually seems like little is happening for long stretches of the film. The original story was centered around the plane crash survivors and had nothing to do with Max at all. In fact he almost seems like an afterthought once the film finally ends. The film has very little in the way of graphic violence that filled the previous entries, and this was a big disappointment to fans of those two films. Mad Max 3 just isn't edgy enough, and at times seems too child-oriented. The musical score is uplifting when it should be menacing. George Miller reportedly only worked on the action sequences, but since there are so few of them you wonder how much he really did on this picture. The film is full of references to other films. Right down to a villain rising out of a tank full of pig excrement ala Martin Sheen out of the mist in Apocalypse Now! Who knows what path this film would have taken had Byron Kennedy lived to help make it.On the plus side, they had a lot more money to work with this time around, and the film generally looks impressive in a visual sense. Each Mad Max film had a different feel and style to it. This last one was just too much like a tame music video than a rip-roaring action film. And it's too bad that Mad Max 4 has never gotten into production yet. Miller instead is too busy making what American audiences seem to line up for these days..... animated penguin movies!!!!

This film however has an X factor that puts it above the others in my mind, maybe it was the production quality.

Before the making of MMBT, Mel Gibson was excited about returning to the Mad Max role for the third time. He gave his own contribution to the original screenplay by choosing to keep his character alive at the end of the movie. In fact, Miller had written a much darker ending where Max gave himself as a final sacrifice. Later, in a tragic helicopter accident, Byron Kennedy died. This caused Gibson to feel enormous mental pressure. The terrible loss of Kennedy started a personal crisis for the legendary actor, causing him to become a virtual alcoholic. During filming of Mrs. Soffel on location in Toronto in 1984, Mel was cast opposite Diane Keaton. Gibson ran a red light while driving drunk and collided with another car. He was arrested and fined $300.Mel Gibson hit his personal low-point during filming MMBT. His state of mind was so deranged that - a time in which he was as drunk as a lord - Mel declared to a PEOPLE magazine reporter. I don't want to be doing this interview.

I must admit before I continue on in this review that I've never really got the Mad Max series. I knew I needed to see them because I'm a huge fan of Mel Gibson(Gallipoli, Braveheart, and Lethal Weapon 1 especially), but I suppose it just doesn't appeal to me. Now I will admit that The Road Warrior was a fine enough action film with a high octane chase scene I sure won't forget anytime soon, but the rest just didn't catch my attention. Likewise, the original Mad Max had a similarly memorable chase scene(though not quite as good) and some interesting ideas(certainly the sets and backgrounds were better in that film at least to me personally) and story elements, but still didn't quite do it for me. Though I would still probably give a fair 7/10 for both(though the first one was a bit better).So you may ask, why even bother reviewing it then? Because, from my point of view, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome is a disappointment to even someone like myself. Why? How? Read on folks, read on.In the beginning I mentioned how relatively speaking, this film is simply average. And by that I mean, if you come into this film wanting action, thrills, and a few laughs you'll get them, but all rather routinely and without the drive and energy the previous films had(basically the strongest points of them). But it's below average because of how the rest of the film basically insults the audience's intelligence as well as just overall being painfully inconsistent with the rest of the series.But first I should probably mention the few strong points in the film 1. First of all, the opening section is interesting, when we first get a view of Battertown(the place in which the film takes place) we are intrigued. 2. The early scenes between Mel Gibson and Tina Turner, which contains cliché, but well delivered dialogue, and a nice fight scene between Gibson and some of the guards. 3. The great, and famous thunderdome fight which is inventive, clever, and exciting. 4. The ending monologue, which has some fantastic visuals, and the words spoken are interesting.I suppose one could count the obligatory final chase scene, but it just struck me as a watered down version of The Road Warrior's chase scene.Now onto the obviously bad, WHAT IS UP WITH THOSE KIDS!!! Now I realize that George Miller was probably trying to broaden the popularity and appeal of the series given the unexpected success of The Road Warrior in America, but he could have done that without throwing something as far left as kids asking Max to help them find Tomorrow Morrow Land!? They drag the story down, and also have no character development or purpose(so we never feel anything for the characters), so in the end it was just them borrowing the Ewoks idea Throw in something cute, and you'll make more money.But also, it's just kind of annoying. It's all second rate stuff. The acting is hardly there a lot of the time, the costumes and sets could have been cool but just come across ugly and unpleasant, and the action scenes are tame and more importantly mind numbing.There's little else to say. It's a very unpleasant film to watch, annoying, treats it's audience like they're all idiots who'll just gobble up whatever is thrown at them, and lacks anything that can't be found done in other movies better.

But when the combat is over he is thrown back out into the solitary desert . Exiled Mad Max meets a group of orphans, the only survivors of a plane crash during the nuclear war .

Max Mad is more about car chases, and action, were this movie seems to lacking this through-out the movie, only at the end. So really fans was seriously let down in this movie, as it seem more concern about the after-math of a Nuclear war, and how the survivors cope.This movie gets bog down with the children survivors from an airline crash, yet most seem unaware of a nuclear war. Yet the older children would be fully aware what happened, as looking at the ages, most of the older children who are in their teens, would be around 9 and 12 at the time of the nuclear war, meaning they would know fully well, the situation.The scene were Sydney harbor is dried up, is totally daft, like that would never happened, regardless what the nuclear war did to the planet, its more likely that Sydney would be flooded than, having its harbor dried.This movie should be a chase movie, not something out of the Lord of the Flies which is really what the story is base around.

In addition, Brian May's brooding operatic score was so good, & contributed so much to the overall feel of the film, that I have pondered over the years that it must have influenced Danny Elfman's soundtrack to Tim Burton's 1989 ' Batman '.At any rate, it was a great movie.But Miller could not just quit while he was ahead-He had to go for the ' Hat-Trick '.The result being 1985's MM BT A film that starts with Gibson,' The Road Warrior ', looking more like ' Lawrence of Arabia ' as he trades his Bad-Ass Black Ford Falcon Interceptor for-A covered wagon pulled by Camels???-WTF???

So when I saw the first Mad Max, I was really impressed, what they had to work with, they created a good low budget action film. Mad Max 2 had nothing but awesome action sequences and a cool rebel that was charismatic, strong, handsome, and just so awesome that could always be known to us as Mad Max. Now we have Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, I have to say while the action sequences are pretty good, I know why not too many enjoy this sequel, it definitely took a strange turn from the series. But it was still kind of an interesting story, with Tina Turner, that was a strange role for her to take on.Mad Max has changed a little bit since his day as the hero, he comes to a land where all his possessions have been taken away from him. He is forced to join a group where they beat each other to the death in the Thunderdome. But when Mad Max doesn't like the rules and refuses to follow them, he's in big trouble. He makes a run for it, but the gang is now after him and will make sure that he pays for this love for humanity. He is pushed into the desert where he encounters these children, he promises to take them to a land that they were heading for called Tomorrow Morrow Land, clever title, huh? But together they head to the world that seems better without being caught by Aunt Entity.Mad Max Thunderdome is over all entertaining, I wouldn't say that this is a bad film. I think just compared to the other two Mad Max films, this seemed a bit flawed. It was a little bit of a different story to take on, but the one thing that is for sure, is any action lover will be satisfied. Tina Turner was actually pretty decent as Aunt Entity, it was very strange to see her take on the role, especially with those earrings she had to wear, lol. But Mel Gibson and she both were cool to watch, I would recommend this if you are a fan of the original Mad Max films, just to complete the series.5/10 "}{"Title":"Redefines Suck","Date":"17 August 2006","Score":"12 out of 23 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" Every time I've seen this movie I get the same impression some parts of it are so amazingly stupid/bad that they crack me up, they aren't intentional, and there are a lot of them; the rest is just plain bad, stupid and/or irrelevant.

Peter Pan more like.","Date":"7 October 2005","Score":"12 out of 23 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" I am going to keep this review of this film short and to the point. This film was a mess. Which is a shame because it had all of the makings of a good Mad Max film... For the first 5 seconds.We start off with Gibson's character Max in this latest incarnation of the trilogy. He plays a broken nomad, the type of person to which he once scoffed at in his days in the Main Force Patrol (Mad Max - 1979). His family and his best friend are brutalised by gang members of a nomad biker clan, making good of turning the highways of Australia into a living hell. All of which is portrayed onto film in a very violent fashion.We progress onto Mad Max 2, which sees our character roaming the 'wastelands' of Australia. These desolate and baron lands become Max's home, as he has nothing left for him in civilisation. He comes across a populated Oil refinery, which is being marauded by a viscous army of scavengers, pillagers and murderers. He brings back a half dead member of the small tribe of people within the grounds of the fortified Refinery and cuts a deal with them, a truck cab for as much Fuel as he can carry. The film progresses and again Mad Max saves the day albeit being left alone again.Then this brings us on to Mad Max 3, if you can even call it Mad Max. This could have been a good film, had they have named it 'Peter Pan and the Quest for Tomorrow-morrow Land.' This film is completely out of sync with it's predecessors. In comparison, this is a tame and softened film of a franchise to which violence is its main selling point. Mad Max with children humming all of the time is not only slightly cringe inducing to watch, but it is not what Max is about. They call him 'Mad' Max for a reason, in this, he is more like a stressed out Babysitter. The most violence you are likely to see is Blaster being shot with a Speer, and Max knocking Savannah Nix out with a single punch, as well as a tribes-man of Bartertown being knocked out with a frying pan a couple of times. That's it. No people being impaled with spears, no kneecaps being shot out, nothing. Even Aunty Entity escapes Max's wrath, compared to her predeceasing king-pins in previous films being blown up, ran over, and blown up again.This film is nothing more than a joke to a brilliant franchise, and not a particularly funny one at that. If I were you, I would just watch the first two films and call it quits there. Pretend that Max is still wandering the Wastelands, helping tribes-people out when they are needy, etc, etc. Although I cannot help but think that this way of thinking is only going to be made harder with a fourth member to the franchise with the pipeline. Lets hope that the directors have learnt from their mistakes made in this dog.1/10. There nothing for you here...

Part way through watching this movie, I felt that Mel Gibson was born to play the role of Mad Max, as he suits the character that was created. I was thinking that this film might have had a very 'Hollywood' feel to it. But to my surprise, I was glad to see and hear a very Australian flavour continuing, which has accompanied all the Mad Max movies to date.Two men enter. One man leaves. That is the law in Bartertown's Thunderdome arena. But lawmaker Aunty Entity will soon add another Do not get Max mad! Max is back as the hero who takes on the barbarians of the post-nuclear future - and this time becomes the savior of a tribe of lost children. However, the power-mad Aunty Entity, a dominatrix, is determined to use Max to tighten her stranglehold on Bartertown.What was lacking in the second of the Mad Max movies was its script, which seemed to be underdeveloped, so I was hoping that the 'Beyond Thunderdome' would be better. Thankfully it was, as there was a lot more dialogue, some intriguing characters, and an even better story, which contained a lot of entertaining elements. I especially like the location of Bartertown, as it still had an 'Australian feel' to it, the idea of the Thunderdome was well explained and shown through the story. Then to have Max, be the protector of all these children made the story just that much better. MM3 was written once again by George Miller and Terry Hayes.But George Miller also did so much more. He directed the third movie, giving it all the necessary touches that have made Mad Max, the movies they are today. Helping Miller in the director's chair is another George, director George Ogilvie. Having two directors I think only enhances the movie all the more. I like the way we see the famous 'Thunderdome' fighting scene, as Miller and Ogilvie focused very much on that event and the many elements within it. I also like the grand view of the open desert that we see numerous times through out the film, as both directors certainly wanted us to see that the conditions surrounding Bartertown were pretty harsh to both humans and animals. Credit for this section of the movie has to also go to the cinematographer, Dean Semler, who shot some great camera angles of the deserts.MM3 also had some fine performers. Mad Max (Mel Gibson) shows that he is still a force to be reckoned with. His introduction to Aunty Entity (Tina Turner) was highly entertaining, as Max takes an impossible situation to show that he is a person not to be taken lightly. Max, for part of this movie, has long hair, which I believe gives Max an even more silent, heroic, darker edge to his character. However I was not a big fan of Tina Turner's performance in the film, as she did not seem at all in her place as an actress, but the look of her character was effective. Tina sings the song 'We don't need another hero' for the movie's soundtrack.I also liked the actors with minor roles in the film. Max is told to separate Master-blaster, who is two identities. There is the very small and intelligent Master (Angelo Rossitto), and the very muscular Blaster (Paul Larsson), who Max has the huge encounter with in the Thunderdome. There was also a very Australian feel to this cast. Pigkiller (Robert Grubb) was a peculiar character that I immediately liked. He genuinely wants to help Max's cause in any way he can. Of the nastier looking guys, you have Ironbar (Angry Anderson), who might not have much to say, but has many lives in the film. In fact, many incidents with him are humorous and breathtaking as well. Back in MM3 is Jedediah (Bruce Spence), who now has a son, Jedediah Jnr. (Adam Cockburn). Max and Jedediah have a very clear understanding, which continues here. Another major component to the film is the use of pigs. I will not say why they are used here, just that I liked their presence every time they were onscreen.There are some amazing scenes attached to MM3. I have to agree that the film contains one the best movie fight scenes ever, as Max and gladiatorial Blaster face off with maces, chainsaws and anything not nailed down inside Thunderdome. It is truly an exhilarating scene to see playing out, (although I cringed when I saw Max drop-start the chainsaw). However the customary car chase scene, which MM is famous for, was not as great here, as in the previous two movies. But it did have the fun sequence showing Ironbar barely escaping with his life many times. I enjoyed the lead up scenes to the car chase, as they had a lot of action and involvement of many people from the cast.While, I like the characters we see in this movie, I do not believe they are as well developed as the people created for the first movie, as they were a lot easier to get to know, love and understand. I guess the big question after this movie is, 'which Mad Max is better, one or three?' I am still a bigger fan of the original, as it is a great film, showing that a small budget filmmaking can be very successful. That does not mean I am not a fan of this film, because I am. 'Beyond Thunderdome' had such a fine conclusion, that perhaps they should have left the 'status quo'. But hearing that a 4th film in the series is being made as we speak, says to me, that Mel Gibson, George Miller and his talented crew have more in store for Mad Max fans.

Max soon winds up in Bartertown, a cesspool of post-apocalyptic capitalism powered by methane-rich pig manure and overseen by two competing overlords, Aunty Entity (Tina Turner) and Master (Angelo Rossitto), a crafty midget who rides around on the back of his hulking underling, Blaster (Paul Larsson). Seeking to re-equip himself, Max strikes a deal with the haughty Aunty to kill Blaster in ritualized combat inside Thunderdome, a giant jungle gym where Bartertown's conflicts are played out in a postmodern update of blood and circuses. Although Max manages to fell the mighty Blaster, he refuses to kill him after realizing the brute is actually a retarded boy. Aunty's henchmen murder Blaster nonetheless, then punish Max for violating the law that Two men enter, one man leaves. Lashed to the back of a hapless pack animal and sent out into a sandstorm, a near-death Max is rescued by a band of tribal children and teens. The descendants of the victims of an airplane crash, the kids inhabit a lush valley and wait for the day when Captain Walker, the plane's pilot, will return to lead them back to civilization. Some of the children, refusing to believe that Max isn't Walker and that the glorious cities of their mythology no longer exist, set off in search of civilization on their own. Max and three tribe members must then rescue their friends from Bordertown and the clutches of Aunty Entity -- a quest that ends in a lengthy desert chase sequence that echoes the first two Mad Max films.

Gone are the highway chases, road wars and Max's personal Ford Falcon, this adventure is a completely new kind of beast...with kids...hurrah!It does seem that Miller took a leaf out of the Lucas book of ideas for this film. A much more toned down Mad Max film with very little blood and road vehicle based death and carnage, but an abundance of children in a kind of tribal 'Lord of the Flies' meets 'The Lost Boys' in a 'Peter Pan-esque' type of way. Not too dissimilar to the way 'Return of the Jedi' went all cute and cuddly towards the end with a large tribe of teddy bears.Although the change of pace was risky and in my view...not the best decision ever, you gotta give kudos to the writers for being brave enough to go in another direction. The film doesn't really offer much action and adventure at any point to be brutally honest, my opinion. The first half set in 'Bartertown' is a complete bust really as all we get is a seedy dirty dusty desert town inhabited by lots of marauder types and weirdo's yet nothing really happens!The bad guys aren't really bad at all, just a bit naughty I guess, the plot isn't really of any interest and goes nowhere and the only action is a rather limp fight between Max and a huge helmet wearing foot soldier/bodyguard called 'Blaster'. We also find out the leader of this wasteland dump is errrm...Tina Turner, terrific.Of course we all knew this before the film came out but it was definitely a sign of the franchise hitting the rocks. After this average kick off things progress towards the desert where Max finds this tribe of kids and where the franchise U-turns harshly, think of an early version of 'Hook' and you might get an idea of what I'm talking about. Its not as cringeworthy and terrible as that Spielberg film but lets be honest its pretty crappy frankly. From here on Max babysits these kids until the plot leads them back to Bartertown for...hmmm not much really, plot is absent without leave.The sets costumes and makeup for the kids and their homes are nicely done, doesn't look tacky or too childish, luckily it all still fits OK within the Mad Max universe. Of course we do still get some lovely location visuals with some beautifully stunning vast orange and tan coloured Aussie outback shots. These landscapes really are the core of this franchise and give it such depth and scope, it just looks awesome basically.After observing nothing much in the form of excitement we do eventually get a reasonably solid yet watered down vehicle chase sequence at the end. Its not as intense as you would expect and barely serves up enough thrills to raise a smile, the violence level is at a complete zero here folks, bloodless. I'm not saying that automatically means the movie will be poor but come on...its Mad Max, lets see some claret spillage.As I said it was brave to go into new territory with Max but maybe this particular idea wasn't the best way. There isn't really anything very memorable anywhere in the film, the title sounds daft and although the Tina Turner theme song is a good tune its all very Bond-like and too glossy.

Max agrees readily.Who's the bunny? he asks, clearly not caring one way or the other.That's about the only Mad Max moment in Thunderdome, which otherwise deepens the character by adding a layer of sentimentality and, eventually, paternal protection to a group of cute kids who live all alone in the deepest desert and sees Max as the return of their saviour.You can read the responses here and on the comments thread. These kids are too much like the Ewoks in Return Of The Jedi, only worse because the Star Wars movies always had a kid focus and fuzzy alien types. Mad Max was geared more for adults, which makes long close-ups of dewy-eyed babes under a cloying score that much harder to take. This long detour into Joseph Campbell-evoking storytelling sessions takes up a lot of time that Max could be spending lubing his car axles with some mohawked maniac's guts.Actually, Max doesn't do a lot of driving in this one, just a bit at the end. For the most part, he's regulated to the sidelines, listening to the kids or else Auntie, who explains about her den of misery It's civilization. I'll do anything to protect it.As long as Thunderdome focuses on Auntie and Bartertown, it's at least enjoyable if not as focused or as visceral as the prior Max films. You enjoy the pungently nasty characters that people Max's world, the debris of the old world re-purposed to strange ends, and the guy who hawks camels by telling a crowd This is the vehicle that sent Detroit broke! Max is there, too, a man of few words as always, his actions building to a cage death match in Thunderdome that is one of the movie's major reasons for being.After that, though, the film wanders. Beyond Thunderdome, it turns out, is more than a cool name; it's an all-too-accurate descriptor of the proceedings. Beyond Thunderdome, there's little for Max to do than go back into the desert and discover his lost humanity with the help of those impish Lord Of The Flies kids.A new Mad Max film, sans Gibson but bringing back director George Miller, is expected to open in 2015. If Thunderdome accomplished anything for Miller and company, it was to lower the bar set by the earlier Max films. Thunderdome is not terrible, it just makes you fidget in the wrong places.

Max then goes to the post-apocalyptic town called Bartertown. This town is ruled by Aunty Entity. To get his car back he has to do some shady stuff. But then he finds himself fighting against Master Blaster in the so called Thunderdome. Well actually he only fights Blaster, because Master Blaster exists out of a tiny man and a muscular giant man. This was the first part of the movie. you can see the movie as two separate movies, and if I am going to tell the epitome of the second movie I am afraid I am going to spoil some things.George Miller came back as the director of this movie, he also did Mad Max (a good movie), Mad Max Road Warrior (even better) and Mad Max Fury Road (the best movie of 2015 till now). In this Mad Max movie he did a good job at directing it, I just don't get why he made it feel like there were two different movies. If the fleshed out the first part of the movie more, this would have been an amazingly good movie, but they didn't. The cinematography was very well done, the camera flows were nice, and there were some pretty aerial shots. Sometimes, mostly in Bartertown, there were long shots, with just a couple of edits, but with these shots they showed really good how the post-apocalyptic town looks like.Due to these shots they made the town more interesting. With these aerial shots they also showed well how deserted the wasteland looks. The clothing design was like in the previous movies, a bit on the cheap hand. But I liked that they kept the clothing style of the second movie. like the rugby sholderpats and the mohawk. The wig of Max looked really fake, which was a big minus for me. The music was good too, it felt Mad Maxy, and fitted well with the post-apocalyptic ethos. This movie stars Mel Gibson, Tina Turner and a lot of lesser known actors. Mel Gibson repraised his role as Max Rockatansky. He was just as good as in the previous movies, although I like Tom Hardy better as Max. Mels Mad Max still had some charisma of the previous films, which was nice. Tina Turner was OK, she was better then I expected, you don't get a lot of good performances of singers. Even though Adam Levigne was pretty good in Begin Again. Turner played Enity. She was in control of Bartertown. You also had the Master and the Blaster. Angelo Rossitto played the Master. He is a tiny guy. I didn't like him at all. He was too childish, just near the end of the movie I started to like him more. He felt like a comic relief. Or as someone who has to lure in more kids to the theater. The Blaster is played by Paul Larsson. Max had to fight him in the Thunderdome. This scene was probably my favorite scene of the movie. It was very creative, and nicely filmed. In the thunderdome the opponents are tied up to two elastic cords. on the roof of the arena there are weapons, and the two opponents have to get a weapon and then kill each other. In this scene Max gets his hands on a chainsaw. This was the perfect opportunity to have a blood fest. But because the movie is rated pg13 it isn't. And it is so stupid that it is rated pg 13. The script of the first part of the movie was well written but the script of the second part, was just plain boring. it was dull and unnecessary. it was just ridicule at times. The story of the first part was good, but it already ends after the first hour after that you don't hear anything anymore about the thunderdome, nothing at all!there were also some clichés in the movie but the thing that bothered me was that they tried to recreate the chase scene from the first movie, but with the truck being a train. the fighting in this last scene is just to comical. I mean, come on, they hit someone with a pan... Overall this is the worst Mad Max film that there is. The first part was really good and gets a nine out of then from me, but the second part just ruined everything for me, and this part gets a one out of then which is a ten out of twenty which makes it a 5/10. This movie is very interesting at the beginning, but ends as a boring mess.

Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this film started out great. Unfortunately, when the focus shifted from inside Bordertown to the desert, things began to deteriorate. Essentially, what started as a good post-apocalyptic action movie switched to a fantasy presumably made for a younger audience. At least that is my impression and I blame the directors (George Miller and George Ogilvie) for getting a bit too cute and trying to appease a more general audience and thereby forsaking the viewers who made up their base. As a result I have to rate this film as only average.

It's hard to be mad when you're on foot, ain't it? Frustrated, maybe. Tired, surely. Mad? Nope. Say what you want about other installments (I'll say that only the first one is really good, others merely passable), but they all had those precious wild car chases. That's what the audience loves about Mad Max and that's what everybody remembers.So, in this third installment Max is deprived of his beloved vehicle and, consequently, his road rage. To stay in keeping with the title, they gave him a mad hairdo. Granted, you'd have to be mad to want to look like Tina Turner, so I guess it's legit. They also cast that very lady in the role of villain. Mad, isn't it? But wouldn't you believe it - at that particular point in history she was bigger than Mel Gibson. Somebody thought this combination would be bankable. However, there's too much Tina Turner in Aunty Entity (!) to fool you into buying into her character and she quite grabs the attention away from the titular character and the plot. Maybe it's for the better because Max didn't look like having much to do other than getting beaten up and saving some hippie kids, and there was barely a plot to speak of.The end result, expectedly, looks like an extended Tina Turner video. She doesn't sing in it, but she looks like she might. I wouldn't mind her doing a duet with Mel, because that at least would've been something to remember out of this all.

His journey now takes him to the humble beginnings of a new society, in a place called Bartertown, where disputes are settled in a deadly arena called the Thunderdome.In this third entry in the Mad Max universe, we are thrown headlong into a more populated world, far more dense than before. This is not a simple matter of Max out-running or out-gunning enemies; he becomes entangled in a conspiracy that turns him into an outcast and a villain, forced to fight for his life, before wandering the wastes and finding the most unlikely resources to retaliate against his enemies. In the film's beginning half, there is some gladiatorial bloodsport, which is a wicked sight. In the film's last half, there is a grand chase scene involving even more of those crazy buggies that made The Road Warrior so memorable; only now, the chase involves a train and a plane as well.Unfortunately, the experience of this film is nowhere near as intense or compelling as the last two in the series. Once Max winds up in the hands of a group of feral children who descended from plane crash survivors, the film becomes a bizarre post-apocalyptic version of Peter Pan, with Max leading the lost boys out of the desert to salvation. Not only does the pacing slow down during these scenes, but the film loses all sense of savagery and intensity that made Mad Max so poignant to begin with. A plethora of goofy antics makes the film light in tone and silly in execution, making the experience rather goofy.However, the story has merit. This is a more complex tale that incorporates some of the tropes and archetypes of a western - complete with a corrupt sheriff-like villain, who seeks to control methane power the way they used to control railroads or oil in those old movies. Max walks into things as a rogue element, but leaves as a prophetic hero; his role as both fits comfortably in the two settings he's made to blend into, and his journey in and out of the Thunderdome proves to be a satisfying one in the end.This film is crafted with decent photography and editing. Mel Gibson continues to play it tough as Max, although his performance seems much more playful in this than in the last two movies. Tina Turner hams it up as the villain, and every other performer does their part well. Writing is okay. This production uses a lot of great-looking sets, props, costumes, and locales. Music is not bad.This film is usually considered the weakest of the Mad Max films, thanks largely to its goofier parts, but it is still an exciting adventure with plenty to behold.3.5/5 (Entertainment Pretty Good | Content Okay | Film Good) "},{"Title":"Did I just watch Hook Beyond Thunderdome?","Date":"15 May 2015","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" I am really confused with what I just saw. Was it a Mad Max movie? Wasn't it supposed to be an action film? Well, apparently not. I don't know what happened inside the director's mind, but he took a huge turn in the direction of the franchise and completely changed its genre. Instead of continuing to be an action packed movie, it became a children's tale.The movie itself is really strange. It is split in two parts that makes you feel like you're seeing two different movies. Movie A, that starts with Max being robbed by some random pilot and ends with Max escaping Bartertown after defeating Blaster in the thunderdome. And movie B, which starts with dehydrated Max being saved by a girl who lives in a children's desert village and ends with Max being left alone by the children and the same pilot that stole his truck at the beginning of movie A. If someone thought that this was a good idea to tell the story of the movie, this person couldn't be more wrong. The movie is running OK and suddenly stops to show Max laying low in the desert with a bunch of kids. It makes you bored in the blink of an eye.As for the other flaws of this flick, I don't even know where to start. I'll try to be as less vocal as I can and just point out the most annoying things about it.Can someone tell me what in the world was Max supposed to be to that children? Some kind of a step father trying to fulfill the emptiness in their hearts? He went from legendary road warrior to worried nanny - And I say we are gonna stay here. We'll gonna live a long life and we'll be thankful.. What the f*** was that? It is like George Miller's manual on how to f*** things up and ruin your badass hero.I am gonna be quiet about the complex plan for rescuing Master and the stunts performed in this so called action movie because it pisses me off. Seeing children taking down marauders with a frying pan is just ridiculous. Like I said in the title. It felt like I was seeing some kind of Peter Panish version of Mad Max.What about the bad guys? Have you ever seen an action movie with no villains and no sense at all? No? Come here and I'll show you. Movie A states that MasterBlaster is the big threat of the movie, but then the tables turn and in movie B, Aunty becomes the villain. It seems to be some kind of plot twist, right? Nope. Just before going after Max, Master, the pilot and the children, Aunty gives a command to her servants and says - Find the little man. Bring him back to me, alive!(...) For those who took him, no mercy!. Good line for a villain who is about to kill everyone on its way just to retrieve what belongs to her. But right at the end of the movie, when Master flies away to his 'happily ever after' with the children, Aunty approaches Max just to say - Well. Ain't we a pair, raggedy man?. And leaves! What the hell is that supposed to mean? You said you were going to kill all of those who terminated your plan of rebuilding Bartertown. It just doesn't make any sense.And I am not even gonna talk (like I did in the reviews of the first two movies) about the fact that Max is, once again, not mad at all. At this point I simply gave up trying to figure that one out.After I was done with this movie, I was shocked on how bad it was. It has mediocre acting, poor editing, bad screen writing and an idiotic plot. A movie that has Tina Turner (despite being one of the hottest pop singers at the time) in its cast as one of the main characters, cannot be taken seriously. And I am sorry if I hammered down one of your favorite movies. I just had to.

It's not even close because Beyond Thunderdome is the only one that's not really a good movie. It has a decent start, but then hits a long draggy section before a big chase and smash 'em up at the very end. Beyond Thunderdome is also the most Hollywood and thus most dated of the Mad Max films, with better lighting and bigger sets, but broader performances, safer PG-13 plot lines, and a softening that takes most of the anarchic sense of danger and that anything can happen from the film, which the previous two had and was part of their acclaim. The performances are a problem. Gibson's a movie star now, and it shows. His Mad Max isn't really so Mad anymore, now he's just a badass --it's a fun, confident performance and Gibson's a good actor so we have fun with him, but it's Mad Max as James Bond, with bon mots and other quips. Not the tortured stoic anti-hero we saw in the other films. But even if the movie star actor has subsumed the character, at least Gibson's a gas to watch. Not so Tina Turner, who is terrible. Her delivery is loud, but not convincing...she's broadcasting, not acting. She has screen presence, but she conjures no majesty. I believed she was a strong woman who came through hard times and was now elite, but I didn't believe she was THAT woman. She couldn't connect beyond herself. The best thing about the film is how they try to expand the narrative from lone outposts in the wasteland to pockets of civilization that are springing up in the wake of apocalypse. The Bartertown community offers a chance for new weird characters and conflicts. The story builds well to the Thunderdome sequence, also another innovation that moves away from the car chase genre Road Warrior and into straight apocalyptic sci-fi. Up to this point, the film's just about half way and still promising; flawed and overly-stylized in spots, but it's created a new sense of place and opened up a new kind of story for Max. But then Max is back out in the desert and he meets a bunch of feral kids and the movie takes a ridiculous twist into sentimentality and cuteness, like the Ewoks in Star Wars. The next hour is Max hanging out with this wild society of lost children, who just happen to have found a great oasis. This leads to a necessary rescue and a big escape and chase back into Road Warrior territory at last, and the film ends on a high note. But boy, that long middle section with the kids is a drag and a bore. It's like George Miller handed over the reigns to Stephen Spielberg and told him to let all his worst tendencies run amok....and use cheap visual techniques to get around a few complex shots for stunt work. One final note A major plot point is that Bartertown is run on pig sh!t, and there are a lot of disgusting sequences where working in or falling in or even being forced to swim in liquified pig sh!t plays an important part. It's played as a joke instead of the disgusting gross horror it should be, and thus completely unnecessary and makes the film very unpleasant to watch in a few repulsive sequences.

Fast forward to now, being a fan of Fist of The North Star and having seen the first two films I decided tonight I'd watch the three back to back to prepare for the new film. The first 2 films were absolutely incredible, so good in fact that I decided to save my after movie pee until they were all finished. I thought it would be the most epic restroom break ever, but I should have done it after the second film was finished. This third installment (If you can call it that) was passable at best. There were very sweet moments in the film where I admit I got a little teary eyed, but there needn't be any sweet moments in a series like this. It should be mayhem, constant mayhem and tragedy. In my opinion, compared to how dark and sadistic the first and second films were, this movie lacks. But it doesn't just lack, it's quite the opposite of the first two; trading apathy for hope. It's a whimsical spin-off and at several times in the film I seriously thought I was watching a Hook knock off(Robin Williams, great film for that genre). Now I wouldn't say I'm a film expert, but I do enjoy a good film. I cannot stand when films flip- flop the content and lore. It's paltry, and it almost ruins the series. I think I counted one death in this one, and it wasn't even a justifiably good/bad death. It's also the longest of the three films.

They had managed to build up a more distinct atmosphere and environment here, and that was one of the best things about the entire movie.One thing I didn't get was why they recast Bruce Spence for this third movie. In part 2 he was known as the gyro captain, and in the third movie he is known as Jedediah the pilot. Was it supposed to be two entirely different characters? I assume as much, since there were no relationship or rekindled partnership between Max and this pilot character. If that was the case, it would have been more believable if they had opted for a different actor all together.It was nice that the underlying homo eroticism tones from the previous two movies were eliminated and replaced by a more harsh and unforgiving post apocalyptic atmosphere.Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome is enjoyable enough for what it was, but kind of anti-climatic following after the second movie.

Not to mention (lightly), one of cinema's best songs of all time We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome) by Tina, herself. Sorry, Mel, in more ways than ten, she stole your franchise.It's obvious with each installment, the budget increases, the sandy desert more apparent and the lack of Max being mad is irritatingly maddening. In fact, maybe I'm missing the boat, but after three features I just viewed for the first time apiece, I'm still puzzled why he's called that. Perhaps a more suitable nickname would be Solo Sam or Loner Lane.At any rate, again, Max faces the rough conditions alone in the desert following multiple events following the death of his wife and child in a semi-destructive future two chapters prior. The simple fact that this key element to Max's, ah-hem, drive hasn't resurfaced since their passing is beyond me. I'm shocked they even brought up that he was an ex-cop in this one as his tidbit of a background.Subsequent to a robbery, Max finds Bartertown and is thrown into a dispute between two leaders of the barren outpost and must fight a brute to gain his belongings back in the deathly Thunderdome fighting cage. Following an unexpected turn, Max is outcast and picked up by Ewoks disguised as children who believe him to be the one to lead them to the same driving getaway climax as expected in the Mad Max universe.The film's watchable and a lot more mature from the first MM feature, though a step down from The Road Warrior.

For an action hero film that intends to be taken seriously, Mad Max 3 is way too quirky. With this in mind, the film feels like a bit of a forerunner to Waterworld. It's ironic, that despite some pretty blatant similarities (feeble screen writing being one of them) the financial success of the two is totally dissimilar. Makes you wonder what people see in this that they don't in Cosnter's famed box office flop. Personally, I prefer Waterworld, because it's a more adventurous tale.Mad Max 3 tries to improve on that which the second entry was missing (story) while at the same time maintaining its muscle mass. What George Miller and his screen writers come up with (in a failed attempt to be clever or fresh) is a sort of desert oasis munchkin land. Despite being surrounded with such hokey characters, Mel Gibson maintains his serious face, and in fact, I think Max is at his best in this movie. Bruce Spence is back too, but he plays someone else, and he only gets half the screen time he did in the previous entry.The ending of the film (sort of) opens the doors to the possibility of one more instalment, but there is certainly a stronger sense of closure to this one, than the previous two, as Mad walks into the sunset across the flat desert, to whatever future. Needless to say there is no fourth instalment, and frankly I don't think one is necessary. The Mad Max trilogy together form an interesting little entry in science fiction genre.

Keen to recoup his losses, Max strikes a deal with Aunty to kill Master, the strong half of MasterBlaster, a dwarf/bodybuilder duo who control the town's power supply.Max picks a fight with Blaster, and the two enter Thunderdome, the arena where disputes are settled with a fight to the death; however, on defeating his opponent, Max discovers that Blaster is mentally disabled, and refuses to kill him, thus breaking his agreement with Aunty; his punishment is to be tied to a horse and cast into the desert without water. On the brink of death, Max is found by a tribe of children, the descendants of the survivors of an air crash, who mistake him for their mythical saviour, Captain Walker, and nurse him back to health at their desert oasis.When a handful of the children leave the safety of their home in a desperate attempt to reach civilisation, Max tries to bring them back, knowing that there is nothing beyond the oasis but a world in ruins. After a long walk through the desert, Max finds the kids, but with water in short supply, a return journey proves impossible; the group have no option but to head for Bartertown...Mad Max 2, the perfect post-apocalyptic action film, was always going to be a tough act to follow, and for the third film, a change in direction seemed inevitable; but when director George Miller sold out for the almighty dollar with a Hollywood-style action/adventure blockbuster that is often played for laughs, a legion of dedicated fans&#x97;myself included&#x97;felt somewhat betrayed.The superb photography, fantastic set design, brilliant costumes and spectacular stunts were still present, but gone was the relentless, gritty, bone crunching, and realistic violence of the first two films, replaced by a couple of admittedly fun, but extremely unbelievable, family-friendly action set-pieces (the Thunderdome fight and a final chase scene) interspersed by ill-advised attempts at humour and cringe-worthy moments of over-sentimentality.Worse still, Miller cast pop/rock legend Tina Turner in the role of Aunty (meaning the film had a catchy theme song, but a lousy lead villain), brought back 'gyrocopter captain' actor Bruce Spence in a role that still confuses the hell out of me (is he supposed to be the same character?), and virtually cloned the climax of Mad Max 2 for the ending Max and the kids flee Bartertown on a train (exactly how and why there is a perfectly usable railway track leading into the ever shifting sands of the desert, is never explained), hotly pursued by Aunty and her cronies driving a cool selection of customised vehicles.Whilst I like the basic idea of turning Max into a quasi-mythical figure, and appreciate that, as a mindless slab of slick, slam-bang entertainment, many viewers will find that it does the trick, Beyond Thunderdome definitely lacks the power of the previous films, is a bit too bloody silly at times, and will no doubt prove to be a huge let-down for those who like their 'road warrior' to have a harder edge.I rate Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome a disappointing 5.5 out of 10, which I will very generously round up to 6 because I like Turner's song, 'We Don't Need Another Hero'. Let's hope that after a 25 year hiatus from all things Rockatansky, Miller will finally put matters right with Max's long awaited fourth outing, Fury Road (due 2011).

I'll never forget that night at the theater, packed house, midnight showing, Friday night, 70mm six-track presentation. Everyone was expecting an Empire Strikes Back sequel with Gyro Captain from Road Warrior getting caught in a situation with Max again. Not unlike Hans Solo to Luke Skywalker. Indeed when the Gyro Captain first showed up in the plane, knocking Max off the wagon, in the beginning of the movie. The whole theater audience broke out into cheers and applause. When everybody realized later on, that Max and Gyro had no previous knowledge of who each other was...my heart sank! In fact, I think everybody's heart sank that night. Why would George Miller do this? If this was a sequel, why would they not know each other in the Road Warrior film? My feeling that night was George Miller blew it! He could have had a mega-blockbuster franchise not unlike Star Wars. I had the strange feeling Mr. Miller wanted to deliberately kill the series. If that was his intention, he succeeded.To this day,I long for the classic Mad Max blockbuster series that will never be. Good going George!

This sequel was not that bad, but undeniably a disappointment.It fits that rare category that follows a SUCCESSFUL sequel that was even more popular than the original, and reinvented the story. Alien 1,2&3 fit the same pattern, except Alien 3 was a goldfish sequel.I just read IMDb's Trivia about Beyond Thunderdome, and discovered some backstory about how the lost children was a stand-alone idea, and then Max was attached to the concept. That was the biggest mistake of this film. It's never worked for me, trying to meld two essentially separate stories into one film. Not woven together, spot welded, and the joint is weak, very weak. When you come from a film thinking about the many ways you wished it was done differently, you don't have anything great. The Lost Children thing never worked, they should have kept the whole story focused on Bartertown. It could have been great.And few chases will ever compare to Max 2 (the Road Warrior), but what I found lacking about the finale chase in Thunderdome was that - it was on a TRAIN. HUH???? Part of our hero Max's strength is his cunning behind the wheel of a mean V8. Or a damn semi. Crashing, ramming, shooting, outwitting, and crushing the opponent. But Mad Max is not a commuter, WHY A TRAIN? Both Alien and Mad Max were, in modern parlance franchises that were killed by a weak script.

A disappointment.","Date":"15 May 2015","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" Now, when men get to fighting, it happens here! And it finishes here! Two men enter; one man leaves.Everything I loved about the first Mad Max sequel is what is missing in this third installment, Beyond Thunderdome, which is the weakest entry of the trilogy. I was surprised to discover that this film was so warmly received by critics in 1985 when it came out because I felt like they changed the entire structure of the series and the Max character. Whereas Mel Gibson played Max as a quiet and antisocial character in The Road Warrior, here he seems to enjoy chatting with others and transforms himself into a completely different person. Beyond Thunderdome also lacks some of the spectacular choreographed vehicle chases that the previous films had and which made the franchise such a hit. It isn't until the final 20 minutes of the film that we actually get these spectacular chases and by that time I really didn't care too much for the characters. It's unfortunate because George Miller's vision of this post- apocalyptic world is intelligently designed, but somehow the characters and the story arch take some absurd turns. The film itself seems like it's divided into two separate movies. In the first half we are introduced to Bartertown, a civilization that is being built in the middle of the dessert, and then the second half takes place in the middle of an oasis where a group of young teenagers and children are patiently waiting for a savior to lead them home. These two stories didn't feel like they belonged in a same movie together and the film takes an incoherent turn from what it was doing in the previous Mad Max movies. This seems to be a much more family friendly film and somehow the producers convinced Miller to include the Max character so they could bank on the success of the franchise, but it feels like a completely different story.Beyond Thunderdome begins with Max (Mel Gibson) traveling through the dessert having his vehicle towed by a group of camels when all of a sudden a plane flies so close to him that it knocks him off the road. In a matter of seconds the pilot, Jedediah (Bruce Spence), jumps off the plane and steals his vehicle while his son flies the plane back home. Max is left with nothing in the middle of the vast wasteland. Fortunately he discovers that there is a nearby city called Bartertown where travelers exchange goods. The city is ruled by Aunty (Tina Turner) who is trying to bring back civilization after a nuclear war has nearly wiped out the entire population of the world. Of course in order to build this civilized city she governs the place by controlling the population with soldiers and slaves. She can't run the city on her own however, because the city needs energy which is powered by Master Blaster who is using pig manure to produce methane. Master Blaster is actually two characters, Master (Angelo Rossitto), a midget who rides on a giant's back named Blaster (Paul Larsson). Master is the brains, while Blaster is the brute force. Auntie wants Blaster out of the picture so she can control Master along with the rest of the city on her own. That is where Max comes in handy because she soon discovers that he is a talented warrior who might just be able to defeat the monster. He promises Max vehicle and gasoline if he accepts to face off Blaster in a death duel inside the Thunderdome, the place where all problems are settled and justice is served. The film takes some unexpected turns along the way leading Max through the dessert once again where he is saved by a group of tribal children who seem to confuse him for Captain Walker, a man who supposedly promised to lead them back to civilization. The film suffers an extremely rare tonal shift once Max arrives at the oasis where the tribal children live, but it never ceases to entertain. The Thunderdome scene is by far the best action sequence of the movie and the film is almost worth recommending just for that. It's an inventive fight scene that is expertly choreographed and shot through some great camera angles. The final twenty minutes of the film are action packed, but it comes a bit too late. It's in these action scenes that George Miller's direction seems to excel, but the narrative structure and character development does suffer as the film tries to bring all these different archs together in an unconvincing and none-cohesive manner. The sequel seemed to have lost the heart and soul of Miller's previous visionary post-apocalyptic world, but I'll still give the film credit for trying to do something completely different from the previous sequel. Unfortunately that inventiveness didn't pay off and I would've preferred Miller stick closer to the world he had envisioned in The Road Warrior. I didn't care too much for the villains in this film either and that is why I found this to be the weakest entry of the series. http//estebueno10.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"No boobies+ PG13= Emo Sissy Boy #Fudgepack","Date":"6 February 2015","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" This movie stunk like the French.

But don't give up on this movie after watching it! Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome is one of those movies that gets under your skin enough to become one of those cult flicks where you have to watch it again and again.OK! Let's make a quick review of the past Mad Max films. Mad Max dealt with a cop who while fighting crime against a gang, the head gang member kills his friends, and wife and child. Max who aches for vengeance becomes Mad Max and kills all the gang members while still driving away in a rage. The Road Warrior is a film that was made during the Energy Crisis with a simple plot of a post apocalyptic world fighting over a gas tanker. Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome has Mad Max fighting again for his property but this time he is embroiled in a plot with a tough female who is the lawgiver and leader of a motley and corrupt town called Barter Town. It is seen that even though society has some order after a the Apocalypse, it has slid into a more unmoral, survival of the fittest type society--dog eat dog world. After Max realizes and is disgusted by this new social structure, he is entered into another plot where some cast off children, presumably survivors of a plane crash after the nuclear war, are searching in vain to find the promised land called Tomorrow Morrow land. Will they reach their destination? Will Max come to their aide? And how will they find it in this cruel jungle world where there is not much compassion? I think this is where the movie drives it's point about how people will live and react after a nuclear attack where they become more animal than human.---The ending of the film sadly demonstrates this with showing the scenes of past devastation. But it also gives out a lot of hope that we can change our destinies even after the War has past---that is, if we even survive....The acting is not bad. Mel Gibson as Max gives out a silent brooding High Plains Drifter like performance. Tina Turner is MOST impressive as Auntie Entity, the ruler of Barter Town. Even though she may look uncomfortable wearing a steel cage life dress, she gives off a sexy persona as a villon-ness. Why she never played a Bond girl in the James Bond movies, I'll never know. The stunts are good but somewhat cartoon-nish--but they are enjoyable to watch.So see the film---if you survive the gritty unfriendly reality of a post war world---It may give you a warning to try to save it.

Only this time with a little more soul rock in the form of Tina Turner. The film begins with Max trailing across the desert wasteland of post apocalyptic Australia for a third time. He stumbles upon Bartertown, a run down old shantytown run entirely on methane from pig crap. The main attraction is Bartertown though is its Thunderdome, which pits two men against each other to fight until one is dead. When Max fails to adhere to this Thunderdome law he is exiled from Bartertown and next finds himself a deliverer of a colony children. The whole story is pretty bizarre, and so is just about everything else about this film.Over the course of the three Mad Max films, the clothing and architecture becomes more and more tribal and much less urban as the world descends deeper into its post apocalyptic demise. Hence why the archaic clothing and decrepit old tribal architecture is so abundant in this film. The film feels like it is set in the caveman era until some article or object from the demolished modern world pops up. The costuming and set design of the film are very neat and a lot of fun to look at. That is until some of the costuming goes a bit overboard. The Mad Max series has always had weird costumes for everyone, especially the bad guys. The fur and black leather had become the norm Mad Max villains, but Beyond Thunderdome made it all a little weird. Some of characters in this film wear minimal black leather outfits that remind me a little too much of The Gimp from Pulp Fiction. But for the most part the design of Max's world is very cool and very different for futuristic sci-fi.It's pretty evident that the filmmakers had all but run out of ideas when it came time to make Beyond Thunderdome. There's little variation between the story lines of Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome as far as the basic plot outline goes. Max travels the wasteland, finds a struggling city, and then rescues a group of oppressed or neglected people. The biggest difference though is that Road Warrior did it all much better. Beyond Thunderdome doesn't stay nearly as interesting as Road Warrior and drags at times pretty badly. The story is definitely there and its fun and typical of Mad Max but didn't have the same impact as it's predecessors. You spend a lot more time wondering why the filmmakers put certain things in the film, instead of paying attention to the storyline. Like I said, this film is just really weird in a good and bad way. There are some strange little nuances that are really pretty cool, but also some things that make you ask why they were necessary at all. Overall it gave me very mixed feelings about this film.The movie would have been a lot better if it hadn't dragged in so many spots. At the beginning of the film Max spends a lot of time in Bartertown and some interesting and strange things happen that build up to his fight in the Thunderdome. Unfortunately when we finally got to the Thunderdome it ended up being fairly cheesy and silly. After Max is exiled from Bartertown he is discovered by the colony of children. Here the film really starts to drag and the film has a hard time keeping a solid and straightforward narrative going. A lot of things begin to seem useless and I started to wonder when things were going to start happening again. Of course it eventually did pick up. What Mad Max film would be complete without an intense final car chase scene? Beyond Thunderdome delivered in that field, but definitely not to the extent of the two previous films. Once again we saw the filmmakers running out of ideas and I'm sure if you looked at the final car chase scenes from Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome side by side you wouldn't see a huge amount of differences. The film definitely picked up at the end, but it almost got ahead of itself and began to feel rushed. The ending was decent but nothing extraordinary.All in all Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome wasn't a bad film. It has its issues and doesn't hold up against the first two films, but it has its good elements. I loved the design of the post apocalyptic wasteland that had grown even more distressed since Road Warrior. The story has a substantial amount of issues but I can't complain too much since it definitely tried and it was no doubt a Mad Max story. If you've seen the first two Mad Max films definitely finish out the series with this one. It's not great but it's not awful either.

Subsequently abandoned into the desert to die, Max is rescued by Savannah Nix, one of a strange tribe of outcast children who mistakenly believe him to be a messiah.I really like all three Mad Max movies, but I think this one is my favourite. It's not as pure an action film as its predecessor, and Max himself is a more moral traditional hero, but it's a much better, fully-rounded story, with much more character depth. The plot is kind of rambling, as Max gets bounced around various people and places, but it's tied together well and every new situation is intriguing and visually imaginative. In essence, it's just a great adventure yarn, with surprises, scares, humour, pathos, fights, chases and a beautifully touching ending. There are three things which combine to make it so much fun I think. The first is the cast, who are just wonderfully weird - Gibson is fantastic in what for me is his signature role, Turner is marvellously scheming in what (sadly) is really her only substantial acting role, and the supporting players are a combination of great fringe character actors like Rossitto and Thring, and bright young Australian child performers like Buday. Of particular mention is Anderson (singer with seminal Aussie band Rose Tattoo) as the henchman Ironbar, who is scary and hilarious at the same time, constantly getting whacked about, and stealing pretty much every scene he's in, especially his final death spasm. Equally good is Graham Walker's eye-popping production design, which expands on all the crazy vehicles and studded clothes from Mad Max 2 into truly bizarre props and costumes raided from junkyards and factories. The fine art direction and Norma Moriceau's terrific costumes add tremendously to the atmosphere and gives the film a unique science-fiction / adventure look, a sort of Lawrence Of Arabia meets Damnation Alley. Bringing all this together is co-writer/co-producer/co-director Miller's steady hand behind the lens, deftly capturing all the crazy sights to see whilst at the same time telling a compelling drama and injecting the whole movie with a terrific sense of fun. Maybe this film isn't for everyone's tastes but I think it's just sensational, and probably the best of both Miller and Gibson's careers. After making it, both emigrated to Hollywood, which I personally think was a misstep, especially in Gibson's case. He may have become much more famous subsequently and he has produced a large body of good movies but if you look at the ones he made prior to this (particularly Gallipoli, Mad Max 2 and The Year Of Living Dangerously), I believe they are much better (and he is better in them) than any of his US box-office hits like Lethal Weapon. Shot in the deserts of New South Wales and at the remote town of Coober Pedy (used in several other movies, such as Until The End Of The World and Pitch Black). Book-ended by two terrific songs from Turner, this is a great Australian action film and is lovingly dedicated to Byron Kennedy, Miller's longtime business partner and producer, who sadly died whilst he was scouting pre-production locations for the film.

Where Mad Max dealt with Max losing his sanity in the face of insanity, and The Road Warrior reflected that he was a survivor, Beyond Thunderdome still had the western flavor of the other two movies, but it kind of slow moving.

They also provide the foil for Max to grow beyond his mere drifting. Both Auntie and Master reveal themselves as far more human than Humungous.The dialog is fantastic, particularly the idiomatic modes of speech for Master and the lost children.As mentioned in another review, I do agree recasting the gyro-copter captain as yet another scheming pilot is a bit strange, but you can get past that.The movie reminds us that society is much more than reliable electricity (pig sh*t), a system of trade (Bust a deal and face the wheel) and a mechanism for dispute resolution (two men enter, one man leaves) and while Auntie has succeeding in creating the basic elements of a functioning society in Bartertown it remains just as awful as the world seen in the second movie.I think it was outstanding to conclude the series this way rather than trying to somehow top the first two in raw violence, action or car scenes.

It certainly isn't as bad as some people like you to believe, but it has lost much of it's power because this is no longer that small independent Australian production. It even had Tina Turner playing a role in it.This time Max is still traveling throughout the Australian dessert, when he manages to stumble upon Bartertown, a trading post for all kinds of criminals. His supplies have been stolen from him and he has no choice but to seek shelter in this outpost of technology where civilization has long gone. It is ruled by both Aunt Entity and Master Blaster, which leads to a lot of tension between the two leaders. Max will fight in an arena called the Thunderdome on behalf of Aunty, where he'll have to defeat Master Blaster. But when the fight is won, he's banished and chased back into the desert where he soon meets a group of children that survived a plane crash during the war. They believe he is their former pilot Captain Walker and some of the children leave to find their fabled tomorrow morrow land, leaving Mad Max no choice but to save them from the desert and from Auntie's Bartertown...Of course I could say that I didn't like the fact that Tina Turner played a role in it, but if I'm honest, than I must admit that she didn't do a bad job. I quite liked her role and her acting. It even didn't bother me all that much that Mad Max was degraded to some kind of kindergarten hero. No, what bothered me most of all was that the movie didn't have much new to offer. Sure, there is the Thunderdome and Bartertown, but in the end this is exactly the same movie as Mad Max 2. What's more, the final part of the movie almost seems to be an exact copy. No, personally I find the first two movies better. Each of them was renewing and original, something that certainly can't be said about this one. I give this movie a 6.5/10. It's nice to watch, but not the best one of the series.

He's still the mostly speechless loner roaming the outback, and comes upon a crudely constructed town.  Tina Turner (I guess she was hot at the time coming off the success of her What's Love Got to do With It? song) is the ruler of this land.  The people are still griping about gas problems as in the first two installments, and have discovered that piggy poop(!) can be turned into fuel.  Mel goes to work for her but ends up piffing someone off and dropped into some kind of steel cage/american gladiator/ultimate fighting championship match.  He and a bad dude are suspended from cables(?) to duke it out.  Mel thinks he's out of the clear when he wins, but ends up getting tossed into the baron desert to die (I guess).  He's rescued by a band of kids who take him to their little community, which is where the film really heads downhill.  Totally uneventful scenes pile on top of one another until they go back to Turner's joint for the finale.  And then FINALLY, at approximately the 1 hour and 30 minute mark(!), we get a trademark chase scene that defined the series.  But that's exactly what the problem is the film is absolutely action-less until this point.  This is a Mad Max film??  Did director Miller forget what made part 1 great and part 2 a cult hit?  The chase scenes, buddy!  Why do away with that and put this muck to film?  And as far as the big chase, it's about as uneventful as the much loved part 2 chase, with everyone going at the same speed, the difference here being that a train is involved.  Still, it wasn't awful, and redeemed the film ever so slightly.  So why is there no part 4 after 15 years?  Max doesn't die (oops, spoiler), so how come no continuation?  Odd that I would ask considering that the only one of these films I liked was the barely budgeted part 1.  Despite my disappointment, the trilogy has a lot of lovers, so what do I know?

And for once, I agreed with him. He was notoriously impossible to please but he did have good taste in films. The Mad Max trilogy recounts aftermath of WWIII. Some people are confused, watching the first movie they wonder why there are still cities and towns, and things still look pretty much normal... at first! Well, when World War III happens, nuclear strikes of major megatonnage will be precisely located. Whoever will still be strong enough when the dust settles, will not want the breadbasket areas of the Earth to be destroyed. Most likely a few major cities of Austraila will be nuked. The real danger is from the resulting fallout and the breakdown in the food chain. More people will die from radiation and starvation then they will from an actual nuclear strike (I think!). The first movie probably takes place close to a few months within a year after World War III. The Road Warrior most likely within 10 years after the first film, and the third film possibly another 10 years. So the trilogy spans the first 20-25 years after World War III. So making an action film in the nuclear wastelands seems simple enough, but what the filmmakers did was use the basic archetypes of mythological characters to make the story resonate with the audience. The Mel Gibson character for example, represents the sort of stranger with no name that Clint Eastwood used effectively, as well as the role of the Shane like savior who comes to rescue the weaker and defenseless. Cinematography, visual and special effects, and sound effects got better and better with each film. I think most people would be inclined to agree the third film is a pretty good film but probably not something for 5 year olds to watch.

However them doing this means everyone and their brother is out to get them. The movie is stock Mad Max.

Now at least we know his name, Jedediah. And he has a son, Jedediah Jr.! This must be the son he had with the girl from Pappagallo's clan/tribe in Mad Max 2. She was played by the pretty actress Arkie Whiteley. It's shame she didn't return and all three of them would have been working as a team. I know a lot of fans say this is a whole new character of Bruce Spence, but I want to believe it isn't. All it would have taken would have been one word Partner That would have made the connection so clear and definite to Mad Max 2. On a funny note, Bruce looks like drummer Stuart Copeland from the musical group The Police in this film to me.And one final note, and I'm surprised no one saw this....was that one character from the 1st film, came back in a surprising fashion! I'm talking about the character of Benno Aunt May's mentally challenged protector from Mad Max 1! (in the 1st film he was played by actor Max Fairchild) I at least realized it right away when Max beats Blaster and knocks off his helmet, we see the face of a mentally challenged man-child. When Max looks at him and realizes this Benno from the 1st film, he can't bring himself to kill him. Even Benno/Blaster recognizes Max now and even smiles at him like he did in the 1st film and the music cue from the 1st film comes on for a brief seconds. That was like a bittersweet moment for me. It was a shame that Auntie's goon Ironbar kills Benno/Blaster and it ended the the brief reunion Max and memories he may have had at the moment.Everyone else the cast was good. Little Adam Cockburn as Jedediah Jr. was hilarious. Reminded me a lot of a similar little guy with a loud and dirty mouth. The one I'm talking about is from the original Bad News Bears with Walter Matthau. Tina Turner did a good turn as evil Auntie. Her sidekicks Frank Thring as The Collector and Angry Anderson as Ironbar and George Spartels as Blackfinger were memorable. Robert Grubb as Pig Killer was amusing. Especially the scene where Max opens the door with arrow stuck in Grubb's leg! Priceless. Edwin Hodgeman as Dr. Dealgood was right on as he portrayed him as a evil, slimy and devilish game-host way. And last but certainly not least was Helen Buday as Savannah Nix the leader of the Lost Children's Clan. And her 2nd in command Tom Jennings as Slack. Tom reminded me of Blue Lagoon's Christopher Atkins character, Richard. Almost looked the same in appearance.So all in all if you watched the 1st two films , then might as well watched this 3rd one.

In no means necessary, I didn't hate this film what so ever even though it is known as a huge disappointment to many to came to love the previous Mad Max films. Yes, this film did have its moments but that still doesn't make it a bad film. This Mad Max adaption still has its same old unusual characters, same Max & plenty of action that will you satisfied for such a popcorn flick like this. I think that one of the situations that drove George Miller to lose his magic touch In this would have to be the tragic death of his close colleague, Byron Kennedy, who was a Producer for the Mad Max films and a very close friend to George. I can't really seem to blame George on this one, the man lost someone he was really close too, this is why he had to delay production for a while just to mourn over his lose. Anyway, even though that is very sad I have to move on with this review. With this film rating being PG-13, there couldn't of been as much cruelty and violence that was previously shown with the action in the previous films, which were actually rated R. After presenting his set of skills to Aunt Entity, Max is now stated as a true gladiator and he's now has plenty of supplies for his travels but before he does that, he has to defeat this man named Blaster in the Thunderdome so he can part on his way. From first glance, you're probably thinking that this is going to be a brutal battle, but yet it wasn't all as it was cracked up to be because based on the films rating, I would of thought that they would of have to keep the battle simple. It was still a entertaining fight no matter what the cost brought, it wasn't a fight to hoot and holler for but it was still a amusing fight. This adaption still had lots on its plate with its unusual tone and characters that still brought the vibe and believability to the setting of the film. Even though the excitement that is brought up in this is so little, there is still more the merrier to come across in this, like Max is still his same old self but older, not great but good chemistry that was put to the test and the same old charisma that brought the same old same old In this outback wasteland. Tina Turner as Aunt Entity was a tolerable choice, Turner played the role well but not truly fantastic, it was still a enjoyable performance that is passable for this type of film and she did portray her talents in the soundtrack which got a Golden Globe nomination. Max actually becomes more respectable and nicer in this as well when things start to have little enjoyment with the tribe that live In the town, there are many aspects that show the respectable side to Max but that's just one thing that worked well I thought. Overall, this wasn't the greatest Mad Max film and yet it's not terrible as well, it's still a fun movie to watch. Even though the Action/Adventure concept is still there and is brought on so little, the characters are still there and so is the storyline that makes the film make sense and decent to watch. I don't despise this film at all but in a few junctures, the film still comes out as a well shot piece of cinema that can be criticized all it wants but still succeed to bring people along with the ride with the true Mad Man himself!

Much more time has passed in this film, as we open with Mad Max's things being stolen and him left to wander the desert with only some shoes and his weapons. It's an exciting opening scene, but while I was watching it, I couldn't help but wonder What the hell just happened? The problem of not quite knowing what's going on plagued the first one, and will continue to plague the film until the end credits.

Things are not as they seem, and he soon ends up exiled until he is discovered by a group of kids that felt as if they had stumbled out of Peter Pan. The movie just feels safer and cheesier this time around. Tina Turner is a very underwhelming villainess compared to lord Humungus and she gives us a very unsatisfactory end scene with Max. Mel Gibson still has charisma, and he's still a bad ass, it's just that the rest of the film around him is so confused. Does it want to be a mainstream 80's action movie, or does it want to be the same hard R post apocalyptic grit as the last one. The scene that saves the movie is Thunderdome itself. No spoilers, but it features the ideas and shots that makes George Miller a master of this universe, and felt like it was one of the few scenes that was true to Mad Max.

However upon repeated viewings I rate it as good as the first movie, just because it surprisingly does have a lot to offer the franchise in terms of style and pacing. Unfortunately production began with sadness, as the series producer Byron Kennedy died in a helicopter crash in 1983 whilst location shooting. Director George Miller was somewhat obviously distraught and reluctant to continue, thus leading to the employment of George Ogilvie (Whom Miller worked with prior) as a Co-Director.Set 15 years after the events of The Road Warrior, Max (Mel Gibson) is now navigating the wasteland by a camel-drawn wagon. It is eventually stolen and the trail of the thief leads him to Bartertown, a seedy community ran by the somewhat eccentric Aunt Entity (Tina Turner). As Max soon learns things are not all as they seem, his exploits in the towns gladiatorial arena The Thunderdome eventually leads to exile, discovery and redemption.Probably the most campiest of the series, and considering everything we've seen so far that is saying something. Mad Max 3 definitely is a lot more kid focused in this outing, but the style is delightfully exaggerated given that the budget (12 million Australian dollars) was the highest the series had seen yet. Unfortunately the car chases have taken a back seat this time around, therefore the other action sequences do a somewhat decent job making up for it. The Thunderdome itself remains unique and exciting, maybe in the future we too will suspend weaponry on the roof of our cage fights (One can dream). Mel Gibson is still a strong leading man, but Tina Turner's hammy performance steals the show and she easily holds her own as one of the most memorable characters of the series. Sadly series composer Brian May doesn't return this time around, then again is it actually possible to go wrong with Maurice Jarre (The man responsible for the music of Eyes Without A Face, and Lawrence Of Arabia)? Either way the soundtrack does the job, but Tina Turner steals the show blaring out her songs over the opening and closing credits (We Don't Need Another Hero would go on to be one of her biggest hits).Final Verdict Fans have openly criticised Beyond Thunderdome for being more obviously Hollywood-ized then the previous outings, but I think there remains just enough here to not label it as the black sheep of the franchise. Though a light, Peter Pan-esque tone certainly doesn't suit a series originally inspired by car accidents and high speed chases, there is enough here I remember fondly to keep me coming back. Essentially it's like an old episode of TV's Batman (1966), it's rusty but there's a certain charm reflecting back on it. 7/10.

I just saw the first two installments for the first time last month, and after finding the first one to be a pretty good action movie, I had high expectations for The Road Warrior, expecting it to be better than the original. However, I found myself disappointed and thinking that second film was overrated, unlike so many others who have seen it. Even if that 1981 blockbuster had lived up to my expectations, I still wouldn't have had high expectations for this far less popular 1985 follow-up, which is unsurprisingly inferior to both of its predecessors.The world is still suffering from the effects of the energy crisis, and in the Australian Outback, Max Rockatansky is still a lone warrior, wandering the land and fighting for survival. He comes across a community known as Bartertown, where people go to trade for supplies. Having just been robbed, Max has nothing to trade, but is taken to see the town's evil leader, Aunty Entity. He learns about the town's underground methane refinery, fueled by pig feces, and run by an intelligent dwarf named Master, with the help of his large but simpleminded bodyguard, Blaster. These two threaten Aunty Entity's ruling over Bartertown, so Max is hired take on Blaster in a fight to the death while the two of them are locked inside a gladiatorial arena known as the Thunderdome! The former police officer doesn't exactly keep his side of the bargain, and for this, he is banished from the town. Soon after this, he finds himself with a group of orphaned children, who mistake him for their savior, Captain Walker! When this film begins, it isn't long at all before we see Max entering Bartertown. As we watch what happens to him in this town, the film isn't exactly terrible, but it already proves to be a little messy. One character I think sometimes put a confused look on my face when he spoke was Master, played by Angelo Rossitto. There is some tension during these Bartertown scenes, but it's still not exactly satisfying. Also, the Thunderdome fight may be a little tedious. After Max is banished is when the tribe of orphaned children comes into the picture, which certainly doesn't help the film. Maybe Mad Max and Peter Pan don't mix. The members of this group are generally played poorly, including the leader of the tribe, Savannah Nix, played by Helen Buday. She might stand out over the rest because she has more lines, and I would say this character is somewhat annoying. This tribe unfortunately only makes Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome worse, and I think the movie would still be a fairly poorly crafted mess without them.Even though this is the least popular installment in the Mad Max franchise, it does have a following. However, I basically agree with the naysayers on this one, and think this was an unfortunate way to end the trilogy, though it certainly wasn't the only time in film history that happened. The first two films are rated R, whereas this third one is rated PG-13, and they really didn't do a very good job making the transition. It's been 25 years since the release of Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (it came into theatres the year before I was born, so I wasn't around to see any of the films when they first came out), and there hasn't been another film in the franchise since then, but it appears a fourth installment called Mad Max Fury Road is coming in 2012, with Tom Hardy replacing Mel Gibson in the starring role of Mad Max Rockatansky. Since this third one is so lacklustre and it has been a quarter of a century since its release, a fourth one doesn't exactly sound like a good idea.

Max makes his way to a settlement known as Barter Town looking for his stolen goods, there he causes trouble & Barter Town ruler Auntie Entity (Tina Turner) is impressed with his fighting skills. Auntie Entiry offers Maxa deal, kill a man & he goes free with his possessions returned to which Max agrees. After his opponent is defeated in the Thunderdome arena Max is banished & left to die in the desert but is found by a tribe of children living in a valley who think Max is their saviour...This Australian American co-production was directed by George Miller & George Ogilvie, not many films have two credited director's but it is generally thought that Miller handled the action side of things while Ogilvie handled the drama & people moments. Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome is a very different type of film that came before, the original mad Max (1979) was a violent revenge drama with some brutal action scenes while Mad Max 2 (1981) is surely one of the best action films of the decade with some stunning stunts & inspired the whole post apocalyptic action film genre while Mad max Beyond Thunderdome is widely regarded as toning the action & violence down to appeal to a more mainstream audience & it's hard to disagree as everything that made the original two mad Max films so special has been watered down. The first third of the film is set in Barter Town & is reasonably good as far as post apocalyptic action films go but then it changes direction & a tribe of children are introduced that Max feels compelled to protect as they help him regain a bit of humanity, these kids are a bit annoying actually especially with their broken English mixed-up dialogue that does get irritating quite quickly & their silly myth about an airplane pilot that they go into great detail about (lucky us...). At well over 100 minutes it does drag at times & while it's watchable it feels predictable & the action scenes can't really compare to those in Mad Max 2.Again there's the whole end of humanity post apocalyptic look, while in the other two Mad Max films it looked quite real here the production design is very elaborate & a bit showy. The final chase revolves around a train & various bad guy's chasing it, it's OK but not as exciting or dramatic as the chases in the other Mad Max films. The violence is tamer here, in fact apart from a few fights there isn't any. Just as the end credits start it says on screen 'For Byron' which is a reference to producer Byron Kennedy who was killed in a helicopter crash while scouting for locations for the film in 1983.The film looks good if a little staged, the stunts & action are good but nothing spectacular & that just about sums up the whole film, good but not spectacular. Filmed around New South Wales in Australia. The acting is alright, I didn't like the little dwarf Angelo Rossito as you can barely understand what he's saying while pop star Tina Turner doesn't really do anything other than deliver a few lines.Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome isn't a terrible film by any means, it's not exactly great but it's watchable. It's just that the first two & Mad Max 2 in particular as so good that this watered down vision of Max was always going to disappoint. A Rumours of a fourth Mad Max have persisted over the years but I doubt it will ever happen.

It seems like the writers of this one tried to make some sort of sweeping epic, but it didn't exactly pan out.

And really I'm not too sure who's to blame. Probably least of which is Mel Gibson, who is still impeccably strong as a the hero of the series, and who in this film- no matter where the epic, lumbering, what-the-hell-logic-wise script takes him- is always in fine form with a bit of humor here and there too. I'd say if anything the flaws might be a combination of two things- the script, which seems to have a focus for the first half and then once transitioning into a second part that might SEEM to connect into the first part goes off the rails into a blender of brawny chase and action sequences, and then the whole scope of the production itself, which is almost too big for its britches, so to speak. Damn it all if Miller and his team don't get major points for ambition, and for trying something different than just the high-voltage exploitation-satire flicks the first two Mad Max's were. But amid the high ideals and shooting-for-the-mainstream tactics, it becomes a case of being too much and too confusing for one common movie-goer to take. What started as a series made perfectly and astonishingly for the drive-in theaters and B-movie houses (and the Road Warrior being one of the very best ever made in that tradition), becomes a near-Peter Pan type of story of good versus, um, evil I guess.Max this time seems to be after a mysterious pilot called Jedediah (Bruce Spence, who is in a similar role but not exactly, kind of like in a Leone film I guess), and it leads him into the dingy, dangerous, pig-s*** powered Bartertown, who is lead by a brain and a brawn sort of combined (one midget, and one very large man), but seen as a threat and possible advantage to Aunt Entity (Tina Turner). She makes a deal with Max to get rid of the brawn for fuel and whatever else he might want, all to take place in the Thunderdome. This is quite a battle that ends up being waged, a very creatively staged bout where the two men go in, one man only to come out (as the on-lookers chant feverishly), with any given weapon at their disposal. When the plan doesn't go quite right though, Max is cast out into the desert, and left for dead... then found by a group of kids who have a few adults in the group of outcasts, and all think that Max is a Captain of some sort, their former leader. He isn't, but somehow he becomes apart of them finding their tomorrow-morrow land, but it just really leads back to Barter-town, among other things.That's the basic gist of the story, as much as I could make of it. The flow of the story is interesting in how it moves sometimes with the same tenacity and edginess of the previous two films, most particularly with Max's time in Barter-town and how easily things can be broken if the one rule of Thunderdome is broken. It's when he goes 'Beyond' it that the script sputters and then starts up only sometimes. What laid also in the previous two films, however subtly in the first one and really with one big point (oil) in the 2nd film, with sort of social points being made, are harder to find this time around. I guess if there is any one sociological point or other it's that any sort of mini-society that forms itself is bound by convictions and ideals of what either works best (as in Barter-town) or what could lie outside in what lay in the past with the cities and civilizations. But the two appealing sides of the picture sort of collide with one another- it's neither a family film or a real mature action picture, but a weird hybrid of the two. It's a little unsettling at times to watch, like a film made right out of the desert, dirty and violent and quite unusual, and with the cuter tendencies of Return of the Jedi.This is not to say directors George Miller and George Ogilvie don't try to make it as exciting as it could be, and the final climactic battle/chase that happens between the two sides, however incoherent it becomes, does deliver better than anything else in the picture. I liked seeing how, in a sense, Miller was trying to take the scope of the climax in Road Warrior, with an important, big vehicle on the run, with little menacing vulture-type villains riding along to stop at nothing to take it down, and make it even bigger than before. But by this point I didn't really have any idea what the destination was for either side, or why the Barter-town cars were still going after them even when they already lost getting back 'the Brain'. In the end, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome carries some mesmerizing images of wastelands and people unbound from hope trying to cling to something more, and in the middle is a hero who almost becomes second tier to everything else that is going on. It's admirable and still some fun, but it's definitely least in my ranking of the three films. 6.5/10 "},{"Title":"A bit better than given credit for","Date":"14 January 2006","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" I want to note, that I speak only about Mad Max 3 and 2 because I still haven't seen the first one.When I was younger I didn't like about Mad Max III.

Until Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, while the previous movies in George Miller's saga are great action films about good cop who loses his humanity (Mad Max) and becomes an almost heartless wanderer, willing to trade lives for petrol and supplies (Road Warrior), this third installment is more of an adventure in which Max regains most of the humanity/soul that he lost. However it is also a tale about the world Max lives in and the people who inhabit it, from the dirty and depraved denizens of the civilised Bartertown to the simple, innocent and clean tribe of children living in the oasis and the contrast between the two societies. This film also features an abundance of shoulder pads and comic relief characters not present in the previous two movies, from the seemingly invincible Ironbar (Angry Anderson) to Blackfinger the bumbling mechanic (George Spartels, of Playschool fame) and Jedediah the slightly odd pilot (Bruce Spence).This movie has some of the best scenes in any movie of its time as well as a soundtrack composed by Maurice Jarre that befits the general mood of the film. As with Road warrior, this film was written by George Miller and Terry Hayes ensuring the continuity of the overall story and the character of Max, a role Mel Gibson was born to play.

I had loved the Road Warrior and was curious about the 3rd installment. I looked at some movie magazine photos of it and wasn't the least bit impressed. My thoughts were' Who's this bald goof with the kabuki head sticking out of his skull? Is this the style in the future? and Tina Turner? What's love got to do with it? Wez and the Lord Humongous were killed off in the 2nd movie, and this was the best they could do? If I were to make a quick assessment of this whole mess, I'd call it a cross between Peter Pan and Lord of the Flies. Adding children into the mix and toning down the violence was a bad idea. The gyro kid's scenes looked terribly rehearsed, with disastrous results. I liked the premise of one feral child with a blade-boomerang, not 50 dirty-faced young punks with mushroom heads.On the filming/editing itself, the first two Mad Max films featured a few rolling closeup scenes, placed strategically to add suspense as they zoom into a character's expression. The character then says an important line as he is looking straight into the camera. In Beyond Thunderdumb, we get a very noticeable overuse of these zooming closeups - which degrade any attempt for a suspenseful shot. Since there are so many of these zooms happening it loses the shock value and becomes comical. The line that the actor spits out as the camera stops zooming and the music comes to a halt really isn't so important, either.I finally got around to watching this in it's entirety (the other day)and I gave it 4 stars for the Master Blaster/Bartertown scenes at the beginning, which was bearable to watch and had an interesting post-apocalyptic theme like the first two Mad Max films. It goes downhill in the second half of the film, after Max is sent riding away wearing a giant clown head.The mandatory (and refurbished) chase scene is also comical. Max boards a train and goes churning across a track with the enemy following. The kabuki head guy keeps up with him by savagely pumping one of those push-pull levered contraptions. At the end, after furiously chasing him for miles, Tina looks at Max and laughs. Her kabuki head cohort had just been killed after crashing the car he jumped in (hmmm...a retread ending here), and she blows it off with no explanation and drives away. Why the sudden change of heart from Tina? Max is left standing alone again. Bad writing, bad acting, and one Mad Max too many.

Max Mad 2 the Road Warrior very good. Max Mad Beyond Thunderdome poor. Why does it when film series get to their third film that it tends to be a weak effort, from Batman Forever, Alien 3, Dead of the Dead, Superman III, X-Men 3, etc? Max Mad Beyond Thunderdome is no exception.The story of the film starts when Max (now looking like William Wallace from Braveheart (most overrated film ever)), has all his belonging stolen by a plane pilot (Bruce Spence). Mad ends up going to Barbertown, a small settlement that attempts civilisation. It is in the middle between Aunty Entity (Tina Turner), the leader of the town and the Master Blaster (Angelo Rossitto and Paul Larsson) who runs the power supply. Max agrees to help Aunty Entity in exchange for the return of his belongings and ends up challenging the Blaster in the Thunderdome (a gladiatorial style battle). However, when Max refuses to kill the Blaster he is forced out the town and ends up in the desert. But Max is found by a tribe of children who live in an Oasis and have created their own myths about civilisation. Max sets up to help when some of the children try to go off to Barbertown.Between the time of Mad Max 2 and 3, the producer Byron Kennedy died and George Miller was starting to lose interest. George Miller does write for the film but only directs the actions scenes, George Ogilvie takes over for the rest of the film. Whilst Mad Max and Mad Max 2 had a camp factor to it, it never over took the story. However, in this film it is overplayed, especially in Barbertown and with characters like Aunty Entity and the Master Blaster. The acting isn't good either. Mel Gibson was okay, but seem tired with the role, and other actors like Tina Turner and Angelo Rossitto was poor. As well, even the action scenes were not as good as in Mad Max 2. Roger Ebert thought that the fight between Max and the Blaster was the most original fight scene since the start of the material arts films; I personally thought it was a poor scene. As well the final chase scene wasn't as good as in the previous films. There were interesting ideas, like people trying to rebuild civilisation and start up trying to make technology work again, and the ideas of the children's fading memories and creating their own mythology, but even that isn't used to its full potential.Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome was a missed opportunity.

The budget is higher than in the previous movies and the whole film has a more polished feel to it, but the story is far less inspired this time around and the main character seems to be developing rather too much of a conscience! Whereas part 1 and part 2 were short, tight and single-minded, this third chapter begins to get ideas above its station&#133;. moreover, it digresses too much before finally coming back to life for an exciting climax. (One carp, though the climax &#150; exciting as it is &#150; is virtually a re-run of the ending from Mad Max II).Post-apocalyptic drifter Max (Mel Gibson) stumbles across a town in the desert called Bartertown. Here, the rough and ragged inhabitants have begun to rebuild a sort of existence under the tyrannical leadership of Aunty Entity (Tina Turner). Max is forced to take part in a savage fight to the death in a gladiatorial arena that has been set up in the town, known simply as the Thunderdome. The rules are simple &#150; two men enter, one man leaves. Max finds himself pitted against a towering giant known as the Blaster (Paul Larsson); but after an exhilarating contest, Max defeats his gigantic opponent. However, when Max refuses to finish off the Blaster in the arena &#150; as the law of Thuderdome states he must &#150; he is banished from the town and exiled into the desert. Almost killed in the burning wilderness, Max is rescued by a tribe of children who believe that he is their saviour, come out of nowhere to lead them to a better life. Reluctantly, Max has to lead the children out of the desert&#133;. but with Aunty out to stop him, the chase is on! Gibson is still very watchable as Max, even after three movies&#133;. but Turner over-acts hideously as his nemesis this time around. There are some impressive action sequences along the way, including Max's hair-raising fight against the Blaster and an extravagant stunt-filled climactic chase. Maurice Jarre provides a good score that complements the on-screen mayhem quite nicely. Between the high spots of carnage, however, the film slows down rather too much. The fates bring Max into the hands of the desert children, at which point he becomes an almost-biblical figure. His redemption lies in leading them to a better life; the job of doing so becomes his personal quest. The earlier Mad Max movies were so much better for their single-minded concentration on action and spectacle; this one comes perilously close to going all sentimental on its audience. One scene that does stick in the mind is the ending, where Max sacrifices his chances of escape to help the others get away. Needing a clear runway for their small makeshift aircraft to get off the ground, Max drives a truck in front of the plane and smashes through an oncoming convoy of pursuing vehicles to clear the route. Those on the plane look on in silent agony as he makes this extraordinary sacrifice&#133;. After three movies, countless chases and car smashes, and enough adventures to last anyone a lifetime, we finally get to see just how mad Max really is!

It's seen as a big budget sellout, a more commercial and less interesting affair than its two raw predecessors. Until recently I bought into that view - I purchased the first two films on DVD (which I've watched many times over the years) and ignored BEYOND THUNDERDOME until it finally showed up in a sale. I only wish I'd bought it sooner! While (intentionally) very different to the first two Max adventures, it's every bit as audacious, imaginative and visually extraordinary, and has aged very well. It also seems to have been just as influential as MAD MAX and MAD MAX 2/THE ROAD WARRIOR. The Flesh Fair in Spielberg's AI owes a lot to Bartertown.Imagine the same film made today - it would be all audience-pleasing quips, as well as CGI in every frame (my worry for MAD MAX 4). But there's real artistry at work here. The script is first rate, and Maurice Jarre's score magnificent. The bungee jump battle in Thunderdome between Max and Blaster is alone worth the price of admission, simply one of the most brilliantly staged and pulse-pounding action scenes in movie history.

It was done somewhat better in the aforementioned film, but here the settings are different, the intent is different and the movie is different.  The apocalyptic feel is greatly emphasized here over the first two films, and this one takes on almost the feel of an epic by the time the final 5 minutes rolls around.The film suffers a bit from slow pacing in parts (anathaema to action fans), and perhaps tries to satisfy too many -- in a sense, it's one of those films that lack a clear target audience.

To me all the three parts are one solid insane movie Mad Max.It's a downright mad movie. Sad and sick. The landscape makes all the actions look wild and post-apocalyptic (desert, vultures, endless roads, spooky forests, primitive living conditions, vacant beaches, and crazy freaks on wheels). It was one hell of a movie to watch in my earlier years. My reaction to this extravaganza was swift a table game with the plot line taken out of the third part of the movie was created (one was to complete it by throwing the dices).Now, as quite a lot of time has passed, there is an urge to watch it every year.Thankfully, there was a chance for me to watch this insane trilogy back in 1989 or 1990 all the way through from the first installation to the very last at a local videozal. Some girl had a few words to say before pushing the VHS into the player. She said something like During the movie there will be about 3 minutes of silence somewhere in the middle, don't be surprised. The sound will come to normal after that. How do you find it? Great commentary before airing a great movie! If it were a run-of-the-mill action, who would care at all about some minutes in the middle of something? But here we all were missing the sound because we soaked up the insane atmosphere of those sick characters' deeds on the screen.How many films, which have strong follow-ups, can be named? Not many, and Mad Max is definitely among them. It was as revolutionary as The Matrix but had great parts 2 and 3, too. The first movie does have the Australian soundtrack indeed.And one more thing if someone calls this film stupid, don't take these words for granted. Among the entertaining, bizarre, mad, and at the same time clever action movies this one is an absolute hydra-king (with three enjoyable incarnations). Don't you see the warning to our human race, which goes in the form of demented motorheads? Don't you feel the doom hanging over people that have no power to resist the evil forces? Don't you see the emptiness of human existence in a high-tech world that is built upon pain and broken lives? Don't you smell the gas of future, ready to blow up?After all these words it is clear as the blue sky of Australia that the mark is 10 out of 10. Thank you for attention.

When left in the desert to die he is found by orphans. Directors George Miller and George Ogilvie delivers on exhilarating stunts and action scenes with fantastic futuristic production. Mel Gibson brings a whole new level to Max in his fight for freedom. In Mad Max he was out for revenge. In Road Warrior he served on a mission. Now here he is as good as ever. Turner steals every scene she is in as the ruler and the role is broad and avoids being typical and straight forward. Fine supporting work by Bruce Spence as a thief and pilot who disappears through much of the film yet reappears later. He was much more prominent in the previous films. Helen Buday plays a leader or such who leads these children. Then there is the midget launched on the shoulders of a gladiator called Master Blaster ready for a dome fight.

I've now watched all three of the Gibson movies, and as such this review will be both a reflection on Beyond Thunderdome, but also a review of the trilogy.Beyond Thunderdome is by far the most polished of Gibson trilogy in terms of visual appeal. The first movie, made in 1979, is grainy and has an old movie feel to it. Road Warrior was a major step forward in terms of picture and production quality, but Thunderdome is certainly the best of the three in this category. I think that was the result of both a larger budget for the film and the many advances made in filmmaking in the early 1980's. This movie shines in a way that its predecessors do not, and its setting is more intricate than either of the two.It's mainly for that reason that I've given Beyond Thunderdome the same rating that I gave its predecessors--7 stars each. Each of the three films have their good and bad qualities. The original film was a well developed story that centered around Gibson's character and thoroughly told his origin story in a way that felt akin to a Clint Eastwood movie. The picture was low budget, but well done. Road Warrior featured a story that was not quite as strong as the original, but it also was a significant leap forward in the overall production department, and its unending action made it fun. so I found it worthy of a seven as well despite the fact that I didn't like the story or its Indiana Jones type of feel quite as much as the original.With Beyond Thunderdome we find a movie that, as mentioned above, is extremely well made, and yet it is a further devolution from the quality script of the original Mad Max, and indeed is a descent even from Road Warrior in the story department. Like Road Warrior, Thunderdome features a narrative that is less about its main character and more about telling a story of the apocalyptic Australian outback that we first saw a glimpse of in the first movie in the series. This latest chapter in the series is a bit odd in terms of how the story plays out--half way through the movie we are introduced to a completely new batch of characters who had absolutely nothing to do with the first half of the movie at all, but fortunately it does eventually come around full circle into a consistent narrative. It's certainly not the best story ever put into a movie, which is a pity given the amount of time and effort that went into making this very well made film. But the story is strong enough-- with the film's redeeming picture quality and introductory act--to deserve to be ranked similarly with its predecessors.In trying to estimate the entire Gibson trilogy, I would have to say that Mad Max isn't my favorite franchise, by far. I think that the major issue that I have with the series is that the tone shifted dramatically from the original movie to Thunderdome. As noted, the first Mad Max was a well developed movie that told the origin of a vigilante antihero--a cop who lost everything to roving gangs in a dystopian future, and then went mad by seeking out vengeance outside the parameters of the law. That story, despite the flaws of the first film, was a compelling narrative that made me care about Max as a character.With Road Warrior, Max's persona was certainly on display, but the situation he found himself in was one that had no real connection to him as his own character. With Thunderdome, Max's tough guy persona and antihero character are downplayed altogether, as the gist of the movie becomes less of an Eastwood clone and more of a kid friendly Indiana Jones or Rocky type of feel. Couple that with a weaker story altogether and the biggest problem with the entire franchise (not having seen Fury Road just yet, mind you) is that the series became something very different from what made the first Mad Max such a brilliant film.That having been said, though, as I was watching Thunderdome, the thought occurred to me that perhaps I've been evaluating the trilogy the wrong way this whole time. Perhaps the genius of the series is not that they follow Max's character, which is what I liked so much about the first movie, but rather that the whole franchise is actually not really supposed to be about Max at all, but rather about further introducing us to the post apocalyptic world of the series' setting. If I step back and see that dystopian world as the main star of all three films, then I can see how the three films fit together nicely. As such, maybe the franchise would have been better served to have been titled not after its protagonist from the first movie, but rather to have a generic name for the post-nuclear Aussie outback. Indeed, a name like The Outback, or Wasteland would have strung the three movies together in a much better way than having them tie together through Max's character.All that said, if I see Beyond Thunderdome as a movie in which Mel Gibson isn't really the star so much as is the weird world in which his Max character lives, then I can deal with Thunderdome and its plot a bit easier. Whatever the case, this isn't an epic that deserves grand applause, but its nevertheless a relatively watchable B-grade movie that advances the scope of the franchise.Now on to go see Fury Road this weekend!

Following on from The Road Warrior--a film which created a much-imitated cinematic aesthetic of its own (I'm looking at you Waterworld and Steel Dawn)--Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome finds Max having to shoulder a mantle of responsibility he doesn't want.Lacking any of the high-octane action of its predecessors until its final act, Beyond Thunderdome is a noticeably more emotional affair. This can perhaps be attributed to George Miller famously losing his passion for the film (after the death of his long time friend and producer in a helicopter crash while scouting locations for this movie) and standing aside to let George Ogilvie take the reins, though Miller would stay on to direct the action sequences. The pathos of characters like Pig Killer (enslaved for trying to 'feed the kids'-- a man whose life means less than swine) moments like Blaster's 'reveal' and Savannah's tell of the children escaping a 'Pox- eclipse' (especially the children chanting Captain Walker's final message, literally carved in stone, before he set out into the wasteland with 20 other survivors-- presumably the last adults--to seek help) and the arrival in the ruined dust-bowl of what was once Australia's Sydney Harbour, particularly tug on the heart strings. Despite this, Beyond Thunderdome's action is still excellent. The Thunderdome sequence may be the most unique spin on gladiatorial combat ever conceived, and the final chase, though short and literally 'on rails' is still an exciting, brutal pursuit.By introducing the children at the oasis and changing its focus, Beyond Thunderdome has come in for the same criticism levelled at Return of the Jedi going cutesy. But the kids of Crack in the Earth become a responsibility Max has to shoulder, when--in their naive optimism--a small group of them leave in the night to find home, he follows them into the wastes to save their lives. In his choice, Max completes a character arc, from a vengeful husband and father, to aimless, selfish, burned-out drifter, to a man who literally leads a small exodus and whose self-sacrifice saves the others. Perhaps due to American dollars helping finance the flick, some goofy humour drips in--some slapstick skillet-to-the-face jokes, some schadenfreude moments (usually at Angry Anderson's character Ironbar's expense, though a poor spectator of the Thunderdome match also springs to mind as I write)--changing the tone somewhat compared to its beloved predecessor. I love this flick and genuinely think it's on a par with The Road Warrior. It has its own identity and emotional arc which I find really satisfying. Maurice Jarre's score is superb, from the clanging, jarring (no pun intended) percussion of the entrance to bartertown, to the orchestral strains of skyraft and the lament for Sydney Harbour, Jarre helps to heighten the emotional core of the movie. All in all, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome is a fitting end to Gibson's tenure as Max it has heart, it has action, it has a few surprises (like the fact that Tina Turner can genuinely act) and deserves to be viewed in a better light.

Now to say that this film is 'dreadful' is wrong, but saying its the worst feature is right. One thing that the entire trilogy does is show us the different points of the nuclear setting, the first Mad Max showed us the beginnings and how law and order were still around but slowly deteriorating. Road Warrior showed us a point in time of desperation, scavenging and surviving by any means possible and Thunderdome is able to show us the compromise, people coming to terms with the world they live in and making a new world for themselves. All three are key parts of the universal disaster trilogy. When you watch the entire trilogy in a day you notice the differences, especially in the third. It started off great and very in keeping with the setting of the previous films, and the actual Thunderdome arena scene is extremely fun to watch. However from Max's banishment it all went sour. The entire time we were in the tribe setting all I could think was 'Hook'. Maybe that's a personal reference I don't know but it just completely went away from the adrenaline fuelled vengeful predecessors. Even Max himself went from being the enigmatic angered 'road warrior' to then being this almost father like figure to a group of lost children. All too fantasised compared to the others, but still saved by some good action sequences. Of course the transition from '18' to '15' can give you an insight into the theme changes but again slightly over-criticised and definitely worth some attention if you like the first two.

This entry takes place several years after THE ROAD WARRIOR and has Max trekking the desert in a camel-drawn vehicle. After his vehicle and belongings are stolen by a pilot, Jedidiah (Bruce Spence, the Gyro Captain from the previous film), he makes his way to Bartertown. Bartertown is a city built in the aftermath of the apocalypse, and run with an iron fist by a strange character known as Aunty (Tina Turner). Hoping to get his stuff back, he agrees to fight in Thunderdome. After getting kicked out of Bartertown back into the desert, he meets a group of children who are surviving the apocalypse in their own way.The best thing about the film is that it fleshes out the world established in the previous two entries, as well as bring in some new elements. The most interesting of these new additions is the Thunderdome, a caged arena where participants fight to the death with whatever weapons are available. The car chases were also creative, and had excellent stunt work, but the Thunderdome really showcases the brutality of the post-apocalypse in a way that the other action sequences couldn't (or didn't). Also, even though it made the narrative slightly unwieldy, I did like the side-by-side comparison of Bartertown with the tribe of children that Max meets. The central theme or message of this film seemed to be about how civilization recovers from apocalyptic events. Bartertown does this by regressing back to an animalistic, violent capitalism, while the young tribe remains innocent in anticipation for the return of a distant, utopian past. And all the while they hope for a better future. Thematically, this film stands head and shoulders above the previous two. Still, the way in which the narrative is drawn out makes the film a bit slow at times, which could turn off people who enjoyed the previous two for the non-stop action. Here, the bulk of the action is saved for the last 15-20 minutes, in a chase sequence that should please the action junkies in the audience.As far as acting is concerned, it's OK but Mel Gibson is the only person who really does what I'd consider a great job. I also feel like Tina Turner was miscast as Aunty Entity, and a lot of her line readings felt really awkward to me. In contrast, I thought that the child actors portraying the tribe did a rather decent job. Overall, despite being a little slow at times, MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME is an entertaining post-apocalyptic movie with great action and some things to think about as well. Highly recommended, especially for fans of the series.

The pace then seems to drag and although intriguing, it just doesn't fit with what was an interesting first act. A big problem with Miller's third movie, is that the tone is completely different. Therefore it's more of a standalone piece. Max could have really been portrayed as any drifter passing through an unruly part of the world. We presume Max is still in Australia, yet the accents are largely American, with a few native and even some English. Just where on earth are we? Gone is the apocalyptic high octane horror and action of earlier. Here are vehicles ran on pig crap. The violence is more comical, with lots of slapstick, and you never really feel Max is under threat from the bizzaro bunch of Henchman. More comedy than cannibal culinary. What I would have given to see a Wez-like predator or another Lord Humungus of the wastelands. The picture is peppered with rehashed moments from the others, which does hint that George was sticking with what has worked in the past on an older, more exclusive audience. Repackaged, toned down and offered on a plate as a popcorn flick. Bruce Spence, The Giro Captain from Road Warrior appears to play a similar if not the same character, we are never quite sure. There seems to be a moment of recognition from Max, but not mutually. Credited as Jeradiah this time, but then again he's not flying a Giro-Copter. His son, a chip off the old block sporting a shaggy mop of blonde hair, a similar shade to the target off Giro's affections from the oil compound? -possibly. Another being the Tribe of children, like fifty Emil Mintys, but less Ferrel like. The big one though has to be the ending of Thunderdome, without giving away any spoilers you will have seen a similar chase before, whilst it entertains, it's nowhere near as brutal or as exciting. But having said that, the third Max instalment does have it's positives, just don't go in expecting car chases and punks galore. Cinematography is nice and the score is as good you would expect, plus Gibson continues the development of Max, from cop-Road Warrior-Hero.What I would give to hear that V8 supercharger again!!

No way did it come close to the previous entries, as it totally felt different in tone (feeling more like mythological adventure epic) and slightly favoured a more comedic route. Although it was bigger and showier, it didn't have that forlorn and gusty post-apocalyptic edge (as it felt a childish and safe) and its car chase sequences / stunt-work (which is the epitome of Mad Max) didn't show up until the last twenty minutes. Even then it wasn't anything memorable. Enjoyably speedy chaos, but well-worn. It doesn't entirely repeat the formula, but that's what you're waiting for. Still we get a creative sequence of caged hand-to-hand combat that involved bungee ropes and weapons. Midway through it does kind of lose its way, getting bogged down with its focus on a tribe of children which had that lost children vibe. Interest arose more so when it centred on Aunty Entity and her Dystopia. And hey great to see other than gladiator spectacles, wheel of fortune is still around in a post-futuristic wasteland. The photography had scope in capturing its scenically exquisite desert backdrop, but it was a smoother looking presentation with some striking visual decors. The performances were modest. Mel Gibson's returns, where his drifter character traditionally opens up making him more humane. Tina Turner is credibly good as the devious Aunty Entity who looks over the city Bartertown. Bruce Spence reprises his rousing role, character actor Frank Thring shows up and Angry Anderson is a delight in costume and attitude as one of Entity's right-hand men. A playful sequel.Two men enter. One man leaves.

Having being robbed of all his possessions Max follows the thief to Barter Town, a rough desert outpost run by Aunty, played by a chain-mail waring Tina Turner and powered by the methane produced from pig manure. The power plant is run by a dwarf known as Master and Aunty thinks he is getting above himself, the problem is wherever Master goes Blaster is also there and Blaster is a giant who can't easily be dealt with without breaking their own laws. When Max arrives offering to trade his services to get his goods back. After an arranged confrontation Max and Blaster must settle their dispute in a fight to the death in Thunderdome. Not surprisingly Max wins but when he sees Blaster without his helmet he can't kill him and is this guilty of breaking his deal with Aunty. As punishment for this he is tied to a horse and sent out into the desert. Here he finds a group of children who think he is some sort of Messiah who has come to take them to a promised land. When he says they should stay a group of them set off alone... when Max learns this he heads after them and they end up at Barter Town, here they take Master and escape by rail pursued by Aunty and her goons who are driving a strange array of vehicles.While this isn't exactly a great film it is a lot of fun with plenty of exciting action in particular the gladiatorial fight in the Thunderdome and the case sequence at the end. Tina Turner is somewhat over the top as Aunty but that is what the role called for and Mel Gibson is fine as Max. The film is notable for including a strange looking Transavia PL-12 'Airtruk', an aircraft that looks as if it was modified to look extra weird just for the film but in fact is real. The other characters were good enough although I must admit I preferred Aunty's goons the the children who could be a bit irritating at times.

There are, of course, exceptions to this sweeping statement, and I have always felt that the Mad Max franchise is one of them, the original Mad Max being in my view the weakest instalment in the trilogy and the third episode, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, the strongest. (There were, apparently, plans to make a fourth episode, turning the trilogy into a tetralogy, but these came to nothing).Like the second instalment, Beyond Thunderdome is set in a post-apocalyptic Australian desert. (The first episode was filmed in an agricultural region of Victoria and made no mention of a nuclear apocalypse). Max stumbles upon the nearest thing to civilisation surviving in this wilderness, the dystopian community of Bartertown. As its name suggests, Bartertown is a specifically capitalist dystopia. The town exists principally for trade, and its most sacred rule is that no contract can be broken, for any reason. Those who evade their contractual obligations are subject to severe punishment. (Bust a deal, face the wheel.) Disputes are settled by fights to the death in an arena known as the Thunderdome (hence the title of the film).Bartertown is ruled by a ruthless female dictator named Aunty Entity, but her leadership is being challenged by Master, the diminutive but highly intelligent technician who runs the city's sole power supply, a methane refinery, fuelled by pig dung. (Exactly how a barren desert manages to produce enough food to feed so many pigs is never explained, but this was clearly not intended to be a realistic film. The idea of an economy based upon faeces was presumably intended to be a satirical comment on capitalism). Max gets caught up in Auntie's political machinations against Master, and ends up being exiled from the city when he reneges upon a deal to kill Blaster, Master's powerfully-built but simple-minded bodyguard, whom he has defeated in a Thunderdome duel.Wandering through the empty desert, Max comes across a tribal community of children, the survivors of a plane crash, living in an oasis. They believe him to be Captain Walker, the pilot of the downed airliner, who has come to return them to civilisation, or Tomorrow-morrow Land as they call it. (This part of the film clearly shows the influence both of William Golding's Lord of the Flies and of Barrie's Peter Pan, with its Lost Boys and Never Never Land.) The rest of the film chronicles Max's adventures with the children and his return to Bartertown.In 1978, when the first Mad Max film came out, Mel Gibson was a virtually unknown Australian actor; by 1985 he had become internationally known, having appeared in British and American movies like The Bounty and Mrs Soffel. He was also a better actor in 1985 than he had been in 1978, although perhaps not quite as good as he was to become in the nineties in films like Hamlet and The Man without a Face. Tina Turner makes a splendidly sexy villainess as Auntie, in a performance which made me wonder why her ventures into acting have been so few. (I also wondered if the name Captain Walker was borrowed from another film in which she appeared, Tommy).What makes the film better than its predecessors, however, is not so much its standards of acting as the fact that it possesses something which is vital to fantasy films but in which they (especially the first instalment) were deficient, namely imagination. This imagination is both visual and verbal. The film's visual imagination is shown in the early scenes, set in the creaking, ramshackle dystopia of Bartertown. Its verbal imagination is shown in the second part of the film, while Max is living among the children. The children have developed their own quasi-religious set of beliefs, centred upon the legend of Captain Walker and Tomorrow-morrow Land, and recite their mythologies in ceremonies known as tells. The language used for this purpose is not correct standard English- it contains plenty of what we would consider errors of grammar or vocabulary- yet it has a strangely formal, ritualistic, incantatory quality.Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome is not a great film; the two halves do not hang together particularly well, and there are a number of plot holes and illogicalities. Nevertheless, its imaginative style of story-telling make it a watchable example of post-apocalyptic film-making, comparable to something like The Omega Man. 6/10 "},{"Title":"Mad Max is Dead!","Date":"29 December 2008","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" This film is a bit mixed up within itself and to be honest I am surprised Mel Gibson signed on for this project. While the quality of the movie cannot be questioned, the storyline itself is without consistency.We open with an Ariel shot of the wastelands to which Max is trawling through on a vehicle pulled by camels (I don't know about you but I am still heart broken about the loss of the V8 Interceptor in The Road Warrior). He reaches Barder Town, meets Auntie (Tina Turner) gets involved in a deal for camels and water / food etc in exchange for him fighting a control freak that resides in the pig pens (Master Blaster). He breaks the deal when he see's that master blaster is not all that meets they eye, he is then sentenced to die in the dessert, is then found by kids (lord of the flies style) and the whole things intertwines from there and loses itself.What you're looking at is the attempt to develop Max Rockatansky even further but it fails horribly. If you cast your mind back to Mad Max where we have a biker gang (lead by Toe Cutter) that kills Max's family driving him to go a bit insane and seek revenge, Mad Max 2 you see max developed into a scavenger (which works well) and a good proportion of his inner demons are addressed and you leave with a sense of is he still our there or not which makes the intro of Mad Max 3 so enjoyable when you realise it is Max. The problem lies in that the story is so far beyond the originals, max is non recognisable and carries with him none of the im mad, leave me alone mannerisms that you come to expect from him, references to family or live are few and far between.I would openly suggest that had this film never happened, Mad Max might have had a future, but it did kill the license by not lending itself to the original Max Rockatansky inception.

Nanny!","Date":"20 July 2008","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" George Miller, this time assisted by another George, *almost* made the perfect cinematic trilogy. For two and a half films, the Mad Max franchise is stupendously brilliant, with unequaled grim post-apocalyptic imagery, outrageous villainous character drawings and nail-biting suspense. The original Mad Max and particularly The Road Warrior easily rank among the greatest cult classics ever, but sadly the third and final act isn't as overpowering and unforgettable as its predecessors. I deliberately stated two-and-a-half movies, however, since the first half of Beyond Thunderdome is still a delightfully dark and old-fashioned sinister Sci-Fi story. Max, still roaming the post-nuclear deserts as a loner, gets robbed of all his possessions and arrives with empty hands in Bartertown. The place is a forced attempt to recreate civilization with trade and gambling above ground, ruled by the charismatic Auntie (Tina Turner), and a wholly impressive factory (turning pig faeces into power and energy) underground. Conflicts are settled within the titular Thunderdome, where literally all types of fighting are allowed. It is here that Mad Max defeats Auntie's nemesis, but he's nevertheless banished into the desert again. The scenes in Bartertown and especially the masterful fight in Thunderdome are surreal and magnificent cult movie material, but then the script incomprehensibly shifts into a bizarrely futuristic version of Peter Pan. Max reluctantly becomes the leader and wise Shepard of a group of forsaken children in their quest to reach Tomorrow-Morrow Land (instead of Never-Never Land, I guess) but all they ever find is the hell of Bartertown again. This second half is far too implausible and raises too many questions whilst, simultaneously, it completely lacks adrenalin-rushing action scenes and spectacular stunts. Mel Gibson notably feels uncomfortable and presumably didn't care too much himself about the choice to turn immortal Mad Max character into a nanny for a bunch of Lord of the Flies dropouts. But hey, Mel owed a lot to George Miller and the MM franchise, so what other choice did he have? There's more dialog and attempt to bring out emotion in this second half, and that's hardly ever a good thing in a testosterone-driven movie formula. The post-apocalyptic Peter Pan plot is frustratingly overlong, whereas so many potentially awesome elements of the first half begged for further elaboration, like the character of MasterBlaster and the history of Bartertown and its female leader. The film nonetheless with a good old-fashioned and steaming race/showdown in the desert, but it's too little too late. For me personally, the wondrous Mad Max saga ends when the wheel of fade points at Gulag&#133; "},{"Title":"Thunder in a bottle","Date":"29 June 2008","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" MM 3 Thunderdome is up and down but is still a fine entry in the Max seres.

While Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (aka. Mad Max 3) of 1985 is by no means a bad film as such, it is just vastly inferior compared to the 1979 milestone Mad Max and the, even more brilliant, sequel The Road Warrior of 1981. Director George Miller proves that he still is a master of atmosphere (this time, he was assisted by George Ogilvie, whose repertoire doesn't include a lot else) in this third entry to the Mad Max trilogy, but the film sadly lacks most of the other elements that made the predecessors so fascinating. The original Mad Max was a gritty, brutal and uncompromising classic of revenge action cinema, and Mad Max 2 The Road Warrior was a post-apocalyptic masterpiece that can easily be named as one of the most defining examples of 80s cinema. The third journey into the world of Mad Max Rockatanski often seems like a sequel that was mainly intended to cash in on its ingenious predecessors, however. First off, the producers obviously wanted to sell this to a wider audience and therefore intended ratings that would allow younger audiences to the theaters (such as a PG-13 rating in the United States instead of an R-rating). Whenever producers of violent classics intend a more child-friendly rating for a sequel, the sequel tends to receive a lower rating from me, as the quality of the franchise usually sinks immensely. And indeed this third Mad Max film is not nearly as violent and menacing as the first two. Also, Mad Max Rockatanski, who was a merciless avenger in the first film, and a antihero who basically didn't give a @*#$ about anybody else in the second, is turned into a hero and somewhat nice guy in Beyond Thunderdome - which is not exactly a conversion of my taste. But it would be wrong to say that Beyond Thunderdome hasn't got its qualities. Mel Gibson, of whom I am not a fan generally, is once again great as the greatest character he ever played - Mad Max Rockatanski. Also the casting of Tina Turner was a good idea, as Tina fits greatly in her role of 'Aunty Entity'. The film actually starts out greatly, but the subplots don't really fit the film very well, and it ends up a bit messy. The film has its great aspects, and several downright ingenious moments, but it is overall disappointing for fans of the first two Mad Max films. Beyond Thunderdome is a worthwhile film, but i highly recommend to watch the excellent Mad Max and the brilliant Road Warrior before this.

From beginning to end this movie lacked in plot, storyline, action, adventure, and pretty much anything else you can think of. I thought that Mad Max and The Road Warrior were great, but this one constantly left me wondering, `What the hell is going on?!'The story begins with our `hero' Max (Mel Gibson) riding his camel-drawn (or horse-drawn) motor vehicle through the desert. He is attacked by Jedediah the Pilot (Bruce Spence) and his son Jedediah Jr. who steal his vehicle and camels and speed off leaving him stranded. This was one of the most confusing aspects of the entire movie. Jedediah the Pilot was the Gyro Captain (also Bruce Spence) in the Road Warrior. In that movie the Gyro Captain had really grown fond of Max to the point where he considered the two of them `partners', the Gyro Captain even went so far as to save Max from dying after a gang of marauders had attacked him and left him for dead in the wasteland. So why is it in Thunderdome that Jedediah the Pilot does everything he can to do Max wrong? Is Jedediah the Pilot suppose to be a different character then the Gyro Captain or are they the same? What the hell is going on?!The plot continued to drift round and round making me nauseous. Max's pursuit of his stolen belongings takes him to Bartertown where he meets Aunty Entity (Tina Turner) who convinces him to fight Master Blaster, which consists of two people; Master (the brains) and Blaster (the brawn). When he refuses to kill Blaster after the fight, he is banished to the desert where he is rescued by a group of orphaned children. After that, the orphaned children leave their home in pursuit of tomorrow morrow land. Max goes after them then takes them to Bartertown. Why? . to rescue Master of course, like that makes any sense, saving the person that was trying to kill him earlier in the movie instead of just taking the children back to there home. Then he escapes Bartertown in a truck, uh. I mean train, or was it a truck. whatever it was it could only be driven on railroad tracks. Max takes Master and the children and escapes on the truck-train thing while Aunty Entity and her cronies give chase in bad recreation of the tanker chase scene from the Road Warrior. What the hell is going on?!All in all, the plot was too disjointed and just plain annoying to follow. Certain problems may have been due to the fact that Byron Kennedy was killed prior to the making of this movie in a tragic helicopter accident, he had produced Mad Max and the Road Warrior and was going to produce Thunderdome.Another minor problem was the lack of an essential part of the previous movies, Max's black interceptor. The black 73 Ford Falcon GT that he drove in the 1st two movies was just as important as the orange 69 Dodge Charger that Bo & Luke drove in the Dukes of Hazzard, though the Dukes of Hazzard pales in comparison to any of the Mad Max movies in terms of greatness, even Thunderdome, but the basic correlation is still the same. It's too bad that the interceptor was destroyed in The Road Warrior, that might have helped in making this a better movie, but there were also a lot of other changes that needed to be made in order to make this a good movie.My advice, don't bother watching this movie. Mad Max and the Road Warrior are great examples of how action/adventure movies should be made, try them out instead, and make sure to get the original Australian version of Mad Max (the one with Mel Gibson's real voice, not the crappy American dubbed version).

Just then, Auntie's aides, Ironbar and Ton Ton try to attack Max, but he was quick on his feet and laid them out. Auntie was now sure she had the right guy. She was going to use Max to fight her arch rival and the ruler of the Underworld, Master-Blaster. Master-Blaster was actually two people Master was the brains and Blaster was the brawn. Master was currently developing a new kind of fuel source from pig feces methane; That night, Master-Blaster just rubbed Max the wrong way by stealing his car. He was ready for a fight. The next thing Max knew, he was in an enormous caged arena called Thunderdome. His opponent was Blaster. Auntie Entity made the law very clear two men enter, ONE man leaves. Blaster had the advantage at first. He threw Max across the arena and crushed him. But Max soon found Blaster's weakness and used it to his advantage. He began hammering Blaster with all his might. Finally, as Max was about to make the death blow, Blaster's helmet came off, revealing his face. Max couldn't find it in his heart to kill him. Auntie Entity, however, had no problem. She then declared that Max had broken the law of Thunderdome and must be punished, and so he was exiled into the middle of the desert during a fierce sand storm. Max tried to go on, but the storm was too much for him. He staggered with all of his might, finally gave up and collapsed. When Max awakened, he found himself in a secluded oasis with water and trees. It was run by a tribe of mislead warrior children. The children took him to be Captain Walker, the fabled air captain who would one day return and lead them to a salvation utopia known as Tomorrow-morrow Land. Max tried to tell them he was not Captain Walker, but they didn't believe him. Well, there was no way he was going back to Bartertown so he decided to stay with the kids.In the morning, some kids got away so Max had to trek across the desert to find them. They were lead astray by head-strong Savannah. Max was accompanied by Gekko, Scrooloose, and Eddie. By the time he found them, young Finn had been swallowed by quick sand. By nightfall, the team was quite weary. Max knew at this point their only sanctuary would be...Bartertown. So under the cover of darkness, they entered the town. They sought out Master, the brains of the Underworld. Just then Auntie's men burst in. With the help of a pig killer named Pig Killer, Max, Master and the kids make their escape in a truck train riding on rails. Auntie Entity decrees that Master must be brought back and Max and the children be disposed of. So the psychotic barbarians mounted odd methane-powered vehicles and tore off through the desert after our heroes. Auntie Entity even joined the chase. They boarded the truck train, trying to abduct Master, but Max was right there to send them on their way. Finally, Auntie and Blackfinger board, but luckily Max and the kids clambered to the front car, so when Blackfinger uncouples the train, he and Auntie are left in the dust. Soon they reach the end of the line. Literally. They make a run for it and soon enough, Max comes across Jedediah, the pilot who robbed him. With his help, Max sees his new friends to the safety of the air, while he remains on the ground for a showdown with Auntie and her gang, who were catching up pretty quickly. Rather than fight Max, Auntie decided to leave him in the desert for dead; Soon enough, Jedediah, Savannah, Scrooloose and the rest come across ruins that were once the city of Melbourne. There, they grow up and help rebuild civilization and tell the tale over and over to their children and children's children They had survived all thanks to that lone hero of the baron wastelands, Mad Max. And so concludes the Mad Max series. I have to say I didn't quite enjoy this one as I did the other two. We're used to high-speed action, but in this one most of the action takes place on foot. Mel Gibson was good, and Tina Turner was good as that despicable Auntie Entity. Bruce Spence returns. He was The Gyro Captain in the last adventure, and now he's another pilot, Jedediah. Could they be related? Also here are Robert Grubb, Paul Larsson, Angelo Rossitto, and Frank Thring; This is perhaps the tamer of the trilogy, as it is the only one rated PG-13. Still, it's a weird, bizarre movie that isn't for everyone. But anyway, Mad Max fans, if you've seen Mad Max and The Road Warrior, by all means see Part 3 Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. I heard rumors of a fourth Mad Max in the works Mad Max Fury Road. However I also heard that the project was scrapped. Maybe Mel didn't want to play Max again? Anyway, until Mad Max 4 resurfaces, check out the current trilogy! They're fast, they're furious, they're mad! I recommend The Mad Max Trilogy, as well as Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, although it is the weaker of the three. Thank you, and drive safely!!- "},{"Title":"An entertaining action film","Date":"15 July 2003","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Beyond Thunderdome is the worst of the three Mad Max movies but it's up against some pretty stiff competition and is a great film.

For those that haven't seen it, this is basically what it is aboutThere exists a post-apocalyptic city where people are trying to restart and eke out a life in an otherwise bleak existence. They have laws in this city. Mad Max comes to the city. He enters into a binding contract wherein he states that he fully understands and accepts the rules of said contract. He then violates his end of the contract. He is therefore banished from the city. He meets up with a gang of nomadic thugs and returns to the city. He then proceeds to destroy the city and force its inhabitants to flee. He flees as well. Some inhabitants chase him to exact revenge. Max sacrifices himself to waylay the inhabitants and help his cronies escape. The pursuers thus catch up to Max. Instead of seeking revenge on Max themselves an awkward, stupid, pseudo-humourous comment is made and they just walk away, therein accomplishing nothing.Therefore the lesson of this movie goes as followsSociety has rules. You can violate those rules. You will be punished for violating those rules. You can then become bitter and return as a  sociopath and violate more rules, consequently destroying the very base-structure on which the rules were initially created.Cue sarcasm A great lesson for all humankind!

The setting was certainly cool, and it had one exciting duel at the start, and a great chase scene at the end, however, the children got on my nerves, and Mel Gibson seemed bored at times, plus the ending was kind of lame!. The action is pretty dull, and the character of Max, has sort of changed, he has too much dialog, and i found him very uninteresting, plus, Tina Turner never took advantage of her potential, she had a cool character but didn't do anything with it. The villains are not menacing at all, and the plot isn't that interesting, plus It's sort of a disgrace to the brilliant 1st 2. This is a rather dull 3rd installment, it tried to go in a completely new direction,and it simply just did not work, worth the watch i guess, however it's not really worth it, so don't go out of your way to look for it, stick with the 1st 2. The Direction is mediocre. George Miller/George Ogilvie do a mediocre job here, with some good camera work, however it feels bland, and the pace is terribly inconsistent!. The Acting is decent i guess. Mel Gibson is not his usual amazing self, he seems bored, and sleep walks through the whole thing, there are a couple moments where he seems interested but overall, he just wasn't himself and i don't blame him. Gibson still rules though!!. Tina Turner is sexy, but her character never took advantage of her potential, and was also dull to boot. Bruce Spence is funny as the pilot and remained one of the cooler characters here i liked him lots. Frank Thring and Angelo Rossitto both do okay and did what they had to do adequately.

I'd seen it before, but not for a long time. Afterwards it struck me that Beyond Thunderdome is not actually the third film in a series, but rather a remake of Mad Max 2.Look at all the similarities in Mad Max 2, Max stumbles across an outpost making it's own fules (gasoline). In Thunderdome, Max stumbles across an outpost making it's own fuel (methane).In Mad Max 2 his car is taken off him and examined by a disabled mechanic suspended on a small crane. Earlier we find out that his fuel tanks are booby-trapped. Exactly the same happens in Thunderdome same car, same mechanic, same booby trap. Even the mechanic's first line is the same Wow. The last of the V8 Interceptors.(The 'last' of the V8 Interceptors was blown to bits in Mad Max 2, so unless this is a remake, where did he get another one?)There are other examples of the same lines being used in both films. And the big truck/train chase at the end is almost identical.There's even the small musical box he uses to 'tame' the Feral Kid in Max 2... very similar to the whistle he uses to 'tame' Blaster in Thunderdome (who also turns out to be a kid... at least mantally).This is in no way a complaint -- the films are sufficiently different to be worth watching, but Thunderdome, being more polished, looses some of the grittiness of Mad Max 2.

Sadly after the death of long time friend and producer Byron Kennedy George Miiler lost heart in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome and had another director named George Ogilvie to direct the majority of the movie while George Miller just directed the action sequences.One thing that makes Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome different from the previous two Mad Max movies is that this one has more of a Hollywood blockbuster feel to it while the previous two were low budget gritty action movies. Apparently they wanted to go in a different direction by giving this movie a PG-13 rating and making it more tame, now this was a nice idea trouble is because of the PG-13 the movie loses that dark gritty tone that Mad Max and The Road Warrior. The movie also loses the violence that the previous two films had.Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome does have it's good points such has the acting, Mel Gibson does a great job reprising his role has Max. Tina Turner does a great performance has Anuty Entity. Most singers who try to become actors don't do a great job and some do, Tina Turner does an good job. Another good thing about this movie is the Thunderdome fight, it's got some great stunts and is pulled off effectively. The final chase scene is okay but again with the whole PG-13 rating it's no way near as violent as The Road Warrior's final chase scene.The bad points with this movie is the lack of violence, in Mad Max and The Road Warrior people got shot, killed and smashed as there vehicles collide with other vehicles. In Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome there's hardly any of that, Mad Max doesn't shoot anyone dead instead there's only one scene where he fires his sawn off shotgun at some guard's head gear making the feathers drop off it and another thing only a few people actually get killed in this movie unlike the previous two.One thing that doesn't sense with this film is the environment, this movie is set in Austrailla so why does the Outback have sand dunes and sinking sand? The Austraillian Outback looks nothing like the way it does in this film, you'd think Mad Max was in the Sahara desert and not Austrailla. Another thing I don't get is why they got the actor who played the Gyro Captain in The Road Warrior to play a similar character in this one.Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome does actually start off quite well, the first half does have the dark and gritty looking tone that Mad Max and The Road Warrior had. Sadly the second half starts to slip and become more lighter when Mad Max discovers a tribe of kids living in the Outback, the whole tribe of kids seems to much like Peter Pan and the Lord of the Flies. The movie does kind of redeem itself when Mad Max and the kids enter Bartertown but because of having kids in it now and having the PG-13 the violence is toned down, the bad guys just get knocked out by the kids swinging around. There's even a scene that copies Star Wars where we see Mad Max chase someone but then runs away as he's chased by a load of guards, the chase scene is okay but again because of the rating it's not has exhilarating as The Road Warrior's final chase scene.Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome is alright but it's not has good has Mad Max and The Road Warrior.

The characters are Max is a nomad wandering the desert, stumbling upon the land of Bartertown in the Wasteland, the desert. He is looking for work there. He stumbles upon the leader, Aunty, who tests him. He passes the test by knocking out all those who attacked him. He is then sent for warrior duty, with the specific task of defeating Blaster. Masterblaster is a two part creature- Master is the brains, a short, arrogant, old, smart man who looks like the dwarf in Twin Peaks, and Blaster is the thug, a mute warrior who has never been defeated. Aunty wants him to kill Blaster and save Master, so she can exploit Master's brains without him latching on to Blaster and using him as a warrior to gain power. Master uses Blaster as a shield so he can seize power with no one threatening him. Aunty is upset about this. In fact, one day Master made Aunty say in front of all the citizens that Masterblaster runs Bartertown, under threat of his embargoing the land. So she wants Max to kill Blaster.They fight in the Thunderdome, a dome shaped object that looks like a wooden version of the Winter Garden, There are weapons on the dome's spokes. Blaster and Max are harnessed like acrobats, and they fly at each other much like the acrobats from Cirque de Soleil. The rule of Thunderdome is Two mean in, one man leaves. Max disables Blaster by blowing a whistle, and then knocks off his mask with a bludgeon. He realizes he is only a large child, so refuses to kill him. He looks like Corky from Life Goes On. Then an audience member kills him. Aunty punishes Max by spinning a wheel with names like Prison, Death, and Aunty's choice. He gets Gulag, so is sentenced to wander in the wasteland desert with a huge funny looking mask that looked like the monster's head in It. Pig Killer is a convict in the pig farm in Bartertown. Ironbar now operates Bartertown now that Master is defeated. Master is locked up with the pigs as well. The pig farm is a place where pigs are farmed so their feces can be used to get methane to power the plant. Pig Killer was sentenced and branded with the words Pig Killer since he killed a pig, if only to get meat to feed his starving family. Pig Killer sends a monkey through a hidden duct, with a canteen. The monkey meets Max and gives him the canteen. Max moves on and collapses. Max is revived by Samantha and Finn, two creatures who speak like cavemen or dummies or Gollum, and who look like Beastmaster or hippies. Their world consists of many remnants of the world that was destroyed. The movie takes place in an apocalyptic future, the earth having been hit by a nuke or something. They fashion a theory about redemption based on the remnants- they have a dead plane which they think the Messiah, Mr. Walker, is going to make work and fly them to Tomorrowmorrowland. They think Max is the Messiah. He explains that it is not so and that what they think is ridiculous. However, they join him in his quest to avenge the people of Bartertown.Max and his new friends walk through the desert and at times the quicksand almost eats the people. He is joined by Screwloose, Finn, Samantha, etc. Screwloose looks like a panda with a hat, sort of like a mime. Back in Bartertown they get Pig Killer and kidnap Master- perhaps they want Master since with his brains he can bring power to any city. They are fought by Ironbar and his companion, a short tattooed man with an Asian woman mask on a pole on his back. Ironbar looks like the anchor in the acrobatic stunts performed by the Cirque de Soleil. In the end, they meet two man, a weird looking father who looks like his son, and they own a plane, so Max drives a jeep toward the enemies in order to clear a runway path, and the plane lifts off, and the quasi-hippies are sent off. Max has sacrificed himself and lies on the floor in front of the collision. Aunty sees him and lets him go, and the movie ends.

If you dislike children's films for example, there is no need to give every one a bad review without valueing it as a children's film. So, as a stand alone film, here is my opinion. The director has created a complex and strange world which is disturbingly close to our own. Even th song We don't need another hero is a metaphore for this. This has been done before, in Blade Runner for example, which is one of my top twenty favorate films. If you liked this you should watch Blade Runner. Even if it has been done before this isn't the main focus point of the film however, and it should be. A lesser director would make it that-but this one dosen't. Fourtunatly there isn't much acting required here. Tina Turner alone proves why that's rfortunate. I don't think Mel Gibson says more than ten words in the first ten minutes, and it dosen't take a genius to walk across sand dunes.

I liked a lot this third (and last) film of the Mad Max trilogy. It still has the tense moments of the Mad Max I and II although this time to a lesser degree. This time Max visits a city run by the clever and also ruthless Aunty Entity (Tina Turner is great in this role). Nonetheless the present film gives us an account of what really happened to earth that brought about the end of civilization, something that the first two movies did not deal with, at least directly.Max is still the lone wanderer with the amoral (not immoral) values burying deep in him the loss of his family and resolving to carry on without emotional attachments to the outside world. This movie provides the opportunities for him to test his physical reflexes and strength. The course of the events leads him accidentally to a community of lost kids in the desert. This time Max needs to become a mentor and help the community with his accumulated wisdom and caring. It is a big change for the man that we saw in Mad Max II, something that quite possibly made a number of viewers to distance themselves from this last film of the trilogy. That's too bad because I really think this film is as good as the previous films of the trilogy.The Australian director George Miller continues to be in good form and takes a further step by making his anti-hero Max to stop for a while, reflect and move on towards the future with a hope that the future will be better for the generations to come without the errors of the past. A certainly more mainstream movie than the two others but still the quality is there. A 8/10 from me.

It contains some kind of hidden message to us that we can not take our civilization for granted. What would happens if things would completely run out of control. Nuclear wars as a result of highly advanced modern civilization that ran out of control because it was led by moral idiots on all sides. Anarchy and social disintegration are result of that between those who survived self-destruction of civilization. All that is told through story of a man who becomes a victim of that madness.Max who is cop loses his family and this is the point of no return.He is no longer man of Law because community fell apart, and it is pointless to seek for justice through legal ways,because there are no longer institutions to enforce that justice,people are left on their own. So he becomes Revenger and enforces his own justice by killing those who killed his family.By the end of first movie he loses his humanity. In a second movie there is a story about brutal fight for limited resources left (in this case some oil).Only the strongest survive and take everything,mankind has been degraded to the lowest point of existence. Max is cold-blooded man living almost like an animal and fighting only for his interest. But there is still some humanity in him and he joins the weaker side in conflict. Fighting is ruthless as they try to escape with what they have. Eventually they fail, but neither other side gets what they wanted to take. Third movie is the crown of all story. Max rambles through a world that has returned to ancient standard of living and slavery of the people. As usually he gets in to a trouble with the most powerful person in the town Aunty (played by Tina Turner) but manages to escape in to a desert.She believes that he died from thirst and hunger and halts the search for him. Luckily he is found by some tribe and brought to their settlement. When he regains consciousness he weeks up surrounded by strange people. Living with them he slowly regains the person he used to be before all madness that made him title Mad Max began. He is a human again. There is an interesting scene in movie when he is brought to something that represents local attraction. They call it a sky-float, but it is actually a wreckage of a Boeing-747 aircraft partially covered by desert sand. Civilization no longer exists and terms of modern language are forgotten,so that tribe does not have word airplane, instead they use word sky-float. This is regression to prehistoric way of life. They want him to take them to a city from stories of their ancestors. He refuses that telling them that they can not make it to there and they should stay in their paradise. If they get there they will find only ruins,but they have to go through desert and territory controlled by Aunty and brutal residents of her town. Anyway they go without him, and he later goes finding them struggling in desert. He becomes their guide. They steal a train from Aunties town and escape. She orders that whole town goes after them and kill them. Last scene is similar like in second movie-brutal chase on a road. They find some turboprop airplane and try to take-off but they are too heavy. Max jumps out of an airplane and they take off successfully. This is his ultimate sacrifice,and they will never forget that telling stories about that to their descendants. He seizes a vehicle (desert buggy) and crashes himself in to another buggy driven by pursuers. Aunty finds him alive but she orders her men not to kill him,because she respects what he did for a tribe allowing them to escape her chase. She orders retreat back and they leave. Max is again left alone and he continues his ramble,but one thing is the most important-he found himself. Tribe made it where they wanted to. They keep memory about him alive,telling stories to descendants that he is somewhere out there-Beyond the Thunderdome. The point is that what ever happens, there is a hope for mankind. We are not lost completely,we can always come back as long as we exist. The story of Mad Max is a story about us.

Now the word that was judged too long was never identified.After numerous attempts at eliminating words eventually I got the sneaking suspicion that the IMDb site is politically sensitive and set to reject certain words automatically.Nothing I wrote was obscene or racist in itself.But after eliminating all of the longest words the same message was repeated again and again,also words that weren't judged misspelled were all the sudden considered misspelled!The pc police are everywhere.

The first instalment was a good (if not entirely original) idea, executed with a poor script, no character arcs, as our (anti-)hero moves from action set-piece to action set piece.I was also one of the poor unfortunates who saw the original bastardised American dubbed version first, which has stayed with me like some terrible eczema....The second film.... Jesus, what a film. Characterization.....bigger stunts.....and a kid with a metal boomerang.And now we get to the meat of my argument, the reason behind why I felt compelled to post a review on this site after so many years of not bothering.....why MM3 isn't the travesty so many of you guys say it is, and the reason is..........well I can't really pin it down.Maybe it's because of the lack of calcium in my bones in the mid eighties due to that bitch Thatcher. Maybe its because I still have erotic dreams about Savanna calling me Captain Walker. Maybe I've done too much cocaine tonight.But what I do know is....if I were to stick one of the Mad Max DVDs on the box now, it would be number three. It will never be a stand alone film. 'We don't need another hero' Auntie warbled.....and as he staggered into the wasteland, can you think of a better one since......?

This time Mel Gibson meets the evil ruler of the post-apocalyptic world (Tina Turner).  Turner is totally out-of-place here. Gibson tries hard, but the direction and screenplay ultimately destroy any chance of this film being a success.  An ugly film that is just as bad as the first two.  2 stars out of 5. "}]
