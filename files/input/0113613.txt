Another prime example but with less heavy drama and more fantasy/comedy is Dogma starring Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. This 1995 film stars several actors that were big names in the 90's - Cameron Diaz, Bill Paxton and Jason Alexander. The story is very dark and bleak indeed. A group of young college-age liberal intellectuals meet daily to discuss the enemy that are conservative extremist and anyone they feel are full of hate. Though well-meaning and clearly sensitive people, they begin to justify a series of murders. These murders are committed as they invite individuals they despise and disagree with politically and philosophically. They poison the wine using a blue decanter. Visually and dramatically, the movie is one of the few good dark movies that came out of the 90's. Art direction in the film seems to gravitate towards symbolic Diego Rivera style art, especially during the opening and closing credits.I feel that some of these then unknown actors (mainly Cameron Diaz and Bill Paxton) were overly dramatic in their roles but then again they were struggling to get recognized as actors. This was still before Bill Paxton would enjoy success in later films such as Titanic in 1997 and also Twister which he starred opposite Helen Hunt. Cameron Diaz came on the Hollywood map with Something About Mary. Even like this, their dramatic acting is logical and believable. The leader of the group of friends is the most brainwashed of the bunch, nearly conducting himself as a cult leader. In a way, this movie looks at how a cult can function. Also this movie is a caution tale there is possibility for evil in both the extreme conservatism and extreme liberalism. It seems quite appropriate a story for today's divided country. It's sad to say America is losing its democratic roots in favor of an elitist and partisan climate. I found to be a great and poignant movie. "},{"Title":"A true hidden gem.  Another Paxton triumph","Date":"22 June 1999","Score":"22 out of 33 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":"  It was a warm summer night and I was in the video store with my girlfriend.  Hey, this movie has that guy Bill Paxton in it, isn't that the guy you like?   I thought I had seen every Paxton movie out there but I was pleasantly surprised that there was one that I hadn't seen.  So we rented it and even though Bill has a small cameo in the film, I enjoyed this film more than I thought I would.  First the acting by the major actors is incredible and all the cameos by famous faces is fun to watch.  Luke ( Courtney B. Vance ) is my favourite character in the movie.  He seems to be a little more intelligent, a little more sinister and a little more angry than the rest of them.  And it is his persona that I look forward to seeing in every scene.  I looked forward to see what he was going to come out with next. What sick, twisted but convincing point of view that he would coerce his cronies into believing.The story is about a few friends that are liberals at heart.  They have their pretentious meals and drink their pretentious wine every night and talk about what is wrong with the world.  Then Paxton comes into the picture and he changes everything.This film didn't get a whole lot of attention when it came out, but now with Paxton's star clearly on the rise after Titanic and A Simple Plan and Cameron Diaz in the upper echelon of actresses, this film may appeal to more people.  And you should do yourself a favour and make yourself one of those people.  This is a great film.  And besides the entertainment value, it really has something interesting to say.  Deciding whether or not you agree with it is half the fun.

So here we go Like the characters in this film, I am a liberal. THE LAST SUPPER deals with five idealistic left-wing college students who are also roommates. Their names? Jude (Cameron Diaz), Marc (Jonathan Penner), Luke (Courtney B. Vance), Paulie (Annabelle Girsh), and Pete (Ron Eldard). Get it? Jude, Marc, Luke, Paulie, and Pete? Last Supper?Well, with these elements of symbolism aside, here is the concept of the film A bunch of liberals inviting conservatives for communal dinners and killing them after the slightest disagreement! How many people here can honestly say they never thought of that? When the film opens, four of the friends are waiting for the last one (Pete) to arrive during a dark, stormy night. Meanwhile, they religiously watch a conservative political figure (Ron Perlman) on television like they usually do. When Pete finally arrives, he invites Zack (Bill Paxton) the trucker that gave him a ride to dinner. But during the feast, a political discussion starts burning up. Zack is a right-wing extremist who fought on Desert Storm (Was that even a war? I always thought it was a Republican propaganda.) and thinks Hitler was right about many things. When the discussion turns into a series of puns exchanged between Luke and Zack, a violent struggle ensues with Zack eventually being stabbed in the back. Soon, the friends start reacting to the murder on their different ways. Paulie is in hysterics, Luke keeps his calm cold-blooded figure, and Jude remains sarcastic. (People disappear all the time. Especially in Iowa, we probably just saved him from an alien abduction.)After covering up the body, the five apostles decide to repeat the process. Luke has an interesting concept If you could go back in time and kill Hitler when he was a frustrated student, would you do it? And so begins the body count Their guests usually consist of the kind of pathetic people one left-winger usually hates. One of them is a homophobe priest (Charles Durning) who affirms homosexuality is the disease and AIDS is the cure. Can you really blame these people for wanting to poison the fellow? This scene is incredibly well done, from the first-rate dialogue exchange from the students to Charles Durning's perfectly timed acting. Annabelle Girsh's hilarious death sentence just has to be seen. (I think it's time for dessert.)As the group continues to make the world a better place, their victims start to become less and less threatening from a date rapist (Mark Harmon) to a spoiled teenager (Bryn Erin) who sues her school because they are making sexual education mandatory. Unfortunately, none of these scenes end up having the same dramatic (and comic) impact as the first two because they are unbelievably brief, leaving the audience gasping for more. The film soon endures the machine gun-editing technique of putting up about 30 scenes in six minutes set to a carefully-selected pop tune in order to sell the soundtrack. There is a subplot involving the disappearance of a young girl who is being searched by the local police department headed by Sheriff Stanley (Nora Durnn) which look like they belong to a different and more serious movie. This is actually unusual since you would expect the goofier moments to come from an ex-SNL cast member. Or should you? The answer as to why these scenes are even in there comes much later on in the film. Frankly, Nora Durnn's scenes (Not counting the ones where she actually interacts with the students) could have all used some cuts.Character interaction could cause another serious pet-peeve to audiences who relate to the people on-screen. The only character who seriously remains constant throughout the entire picture is Luke, while the others all seem to switch personalities. In one scene, Paulie is extremely against the killings while Judy is totally for it. But later on (In one of the film's funniest sequences) the actresses seem to switch roles. A hysterical Judy ends up screaming out that they shouldn't be killing people while Paulie coldly replies They are not people, they are people who hate! The Pete character is seriously undeveloped while Marc is hardly any better. The film does eventually pick up with the very last victim they choose, which I won't spoil. Not counting the suspenseful showdown, nothing really happens during the last 15 minutes but dialogue exchange in the dinner table bringing up usual liberal vs. conservative topics, and there is where the movie truly shines like it did with the beginning. It's a shame it had to end, really. Conservatives bashed this film as the ultimate proof that liberals run Hollywood, not realizing the film does defend them to one extent. It doesn't matter how fun the characters' concept seems to be, it's still sick and it goes against one of the major freedoms that liberals should be defending The freedom of speech. Out of the film's then-unknown lead actors, the only one that really made it to be a star is obviously Cameron Diaz. But no matter how underdeveloped the characterization is, all the actors are able to keep us entertaining. Courtney B. Vance and Ron Perlman seem to own the film during the last moments. As for the dinner-guests, they end up being more well-known cameos. Aside from Durning, Harmon, and Paxton, get ready to see Jason Alexander having a (short) blast as an anti-environmentalist businessman.THE LAST SUPPER is still one strong freedom of speech defense argument well-directed by Stacey Tile who heads up an interesting young cast and a well-done premise. Had the film remained in the dinner table more often, it could have been easily one of my favorite black comedies.

Five liberal students, who think they have the answers to all the world's ills, have their comfortable world invaded by a redneck racist who is invited in for supper after coming to the aid of one of the students when he has car trouble. Naturally there is a clash of politics and, after a violent argument, the racist is accidentally killed. They decide to bury him in their garden instead of reporting the killing. What follows is a continuation of an earlier debate they had been having; would people be justified in murdering someone if they knew he was evil? Their answer is yes, and soon they are inviting other rightwingers for an evening of dinner, debate and death. On the first level the film is okay.It is on the second, more cerebral level, that the film really succeeds. The great irony is that the liberals become intolerant, revealing the dangers of political correctness and the very real possibility of a left-wing police state in which alternative views are crushed in the name liberal values.A good soundtrack, some sparkling cameos by the dinner guests, and a knockout performance by Ron Perlman as the conservative commentator make this largely overlooked comedy well worth a gander.

The questions it asks are philosophical, about the nature of the human mind in general hence the way Marc and his girlfriend at first were turned on, then gradually became estranged as their gratuitous villainy became more conscious was a comment on the dark side of sexuality; the same comment was made about human aggression when the character who shot clay pigeons for a hobby suddenly decides to shoot a real live bird - in fact, that seems to be a decisive moment in the film, the expression on the character's face when he shoots the bird says it all.

And it does it beautifully. I can sum it up by using Norman's quote (one of the characters) toward the end of the movie There are always extremists on both sides of the spectrum. And sadly, we can't achieve anything with those extremists. Those are the ones that make the most noise, but the decision makers are the moderates. Well I'm not sure if Norman can be considered a moderate (his speech makes him one, but his action at the end of the movie - poisoning all 5 of them - can be categorized as an extreme measure as well). But he ended up being the decision maker for this story. It's also karma in a way (what goes around comes around). One of the commentators for this movie says that The film even concludes that's it's morally righteous to kill a right wing pundit if it prevent him/her from someday rising to the office of President. That is COMPLETELY the wrong intention of the movie. I don't think the movie even remotely endorses that idea. Having watched the movie twice, there's not one incident in the movie that suggests that. The movie brings out the irony of how extremists think. The group of 5 students think the victims they kill are extremists, while THEY are the extremists themselves without realizing it. And Norman, at the end, even though claiming he's a moderate, uses extreme measure as well by killing all 5 of them. He should have left that decision to be made by the police. I also love the humor of this movie. There are scenes that I feel ashamed for laughing because there are dead people in the scenes. The acting of the cast is great too. So if you are one that enjoys deep, intense storyline and actually WATCH the movie and understand what its intention is, then you will like this movie.

In doing so, we are allowed to follow their transformation from the yuppie, do-nothing winers that Bill Paxton's character accuses them of being, into the Hitleresque death squad that they eventually become.  This film does not take a political stand to say the least.  Every character in the film lacks depth, not because it is a poor film, but because the characters are supposed to lack depth.

This film takes a deep hard look into the terrible potential of well-meaning people to become perverted by ideology into performing the most heinous of acts.

One sunday they have an unexpected guest who's extreme views ager them and lead to his death. instead of being horrified they get the bug and end up  inviting people with views they disagree with only to poison them and bury them in the garden. They eventually start killing people for views that arent extreme and thing get out of hand. As i said things do get a little silly and i would like to have seen this done in a more serious manner but after all this is a black comedy and it very good.

All this exposition of criteria takes considerable time, and evidently character development needed to be sacrificed.  I'm sure that in creating a large group of murderers who all share a house, the creators had something in mind (other than Friends) and we get the impression of an attempt at characterization but it doesn't jell.  The movie would have been better off with just one couple in on the plot; that's all Shakespeare needed for Macbeth.

And that's including RoboCop 3.  I accept it's a low budget film, but that's no excuse for the leaden script, the bizarre pacing and direction, and basically wasting what little effort was put into it.  The guest stars were all good - indeed, Ron Pearlman was the most likeable character in the film, and I'm talking about his 'fascist politician' scenes, too.There is nothing to recommend about this movie - the characters are obnoxious and self-assured wannabe standup comedians.  My friends and I sat stoney faced as one liner after failed one liner dropped limply from the 'clever and witty script'.There were moments when character development threatened to appear, as some sort of depth was introduced to the 2D stars, only for it to vanish as if it had wandered in only by accident and didn't want to cause a fuss.In fact, the characterisation was possibly the reason I hated this film so much.  It seems the writers were too busy trying to show the friends enjoying each others' company so much that they forgot to include any reason why.  As best I could tell, it seemed they all got together for the conversation/meal evenings purely so they could compete in witty banter and grin.And for some reason there was an odd are-they-aren't-they sexual tension between the dark haired woman and the black guy that went nowhere and did nothing other than take up valuable story time.  Which was probably the point - the entire film could have been condensed to a five minute short, and would have benefitted innumerably from the need to cut the chaff.The almost final scene, in the kitchen (I won't give any details away, for those who want to see it.) was almost farcical, as the mood violently swung in directions I didn't think possible.  The conclusion was obvious, inconclusive, unsatisfying and ultimately reflected the movie as a whole. I guess, in that sense, you could call it a success.To sum up, this bites.  A stellar cast and an intriguing premise result in the worst film of the nineties.  Burn it.  It must be stopped.

Would I have done something more productive? I think, yes. Even if I spent the entire time banging my head against the wall for the whole time, it would have been a far better endeavor than watching this trash.While ultimately this film tries to make you think about tolerating the opinion of the next person, it conducts its' lesson by creating conservative stereotypes as manifested by left-wingers. So if the roles had been reversed, liberals would be screaming about this film years later. But since the Hollywood community is controlled by left-wingers, you don't hear a peep out of anyone in that industry about the horrible personalities created by this film.The sad thing is that the characters created in this film are really how Hollywood sees conservatives. Left-wingers actually create these people and truly believe that this is the way conservatives think and act. Of course, conservatives don't think and act as depicted in this film but left-wingers don't understand this point. This is the main reason why liberalism is a dying idealogy in the U.S. It's an idealogy that just doesn't get it. It creates enemies that don't exist and in fighting these imaginary enemies, their real opponents walk away the victor.This might have been a good film if the conservatives in the film were real. That their opinions were those of real conservatives. But the problem would have been that the liberal characters would have been seen in a far worse light than just murderers; they would have been seen as irrational lunatics that can't see reason. And that's not what the director was trying to show. The idea was to show liberals as being well-intentioned yet mistaken in their methods.If they had done the film correctly, conservatives would be invited to supper, they would have explained real-world thinking to the liberals, and the liberals would have killed the conservatives simply because they could not grasp what mainstream America already embraces as its' philosophy. But, again, this would have taken the film in too far of a supportive perspective of conservatives and that's certainly not acceptable to the producers of this poorly conceived tripe.

The movie is very jaded and cynical in its presentation. The plot goes that the group of five kill off dinner guests weekly.  With lots of colorful symbolism, a slew of cameos, and strong performances by 3 out of the 5 group members, this movie grew on me after viewing it and thinking back on what I witnessed.  I'm not going to give away anything but the last 20 minutes of this movie more than make up for the flaws, which there still are a quite a few.  The first knock I have on this movie is that Cameron Diaz's and Annebeth Gish's performances are not really that great.  Diaz is cast as one of the most important characters, but her acting ability is tested greatly as she has to deliver most of her lines behind a table, without her best attribute (her body) showing.  Her weak ability to speak her lines becomes obvious with the excellent performances of the rest of the cast.  Gish's problem is the weakness of the character, because she plays the one of the five that could have easily been written out.Other problems in this movie are not as important.  One is that half way through the movie becomes repetitive.  The director shoots this part quickly, and with a tongue in cheek style, but it still comes across dull. The policewoman character is added to the story and is pointless and just used as a character builder and attitude change for one of the five.All criticism aside, watch this movie.  If it gets to the middle and you aren't sure you want to finish it, FAST FORWARD and watch the end.  The speech given is perhaps one of the best political speeches I have heard in a film.

But also that both have the right to exist and is healthy for a society to have a wide variety of opinions. None of the characters are supposed to be geniuses or deliver any intelligent argument, on the contrary they're meant to be very close minded. It's obvious that the characters are supposed to be opinionated, self righteous and vapid...not to mention over the top stereotypes (and i mean both the hosts and the guests). The movie itself it's an exaggeration to illustrate a point.As the plot progresses the characters get more sucked into violent actions (by conviction or group pressure), the bodies start to pile up and the situation spirals out of control. The only character that is more on the normal side, is the cop/sheriff (Nora Dunn). Side note I liked her performance by the way, and I usually don't like her acting, but she was OK in this one (although not very memorable).I'm sad to see some of the people who made reviews for the movie didn't get what it was meant to say or bother to watch this all the way through (because it's mentioned in the movie near the end, in case you are a bit slow). But that is exactly the point of the movie, some people just wants to be told right and have whatever opinion they have prevail in society.On the comedy side, it's got a mild feel of screwball without going too crazy with it, that was very enjoyable. To put this in other words it doesn't go into Clue or Arsenic and old lace territory, is more subtle but is still noticeable. The comedy moments are very controlled, but is still very funny if you relax and just watch it, instead of taking sides.

However after an incident with one ex-soldier, they start inviting over highly conservative individuals and poisoning them one by one. The movie is fun, I like the premise and the graphics. However it's not serious or believable. I don't like how they put it together. For example the very first guest was a priest who was very offensive towards homosexuals. He was condescending and harsh. However he never indicated any intention to physically harm homosexual individuals. All he said was that he believed they were sinning badly, he wasn't carrying out any act on them. I don't think he was an appropriate way to start the killings at all, they should have started with some gun wielding far-right redneck who made multiple threats about killing black people or homosexuals. They could have then progressed to some fatcat individuals destroying the environment, poisoning water supplies, inducing slave labour. Even though the writers missed these opportunities to highlight the real issues, they do seem like liberals. The people with strong conservative viewpoints are portrayed as illiterates. I realize we are seeing things from the point of the liberal college students, but there's more to it than that. A kind of dismissal of topics such as abortion as being something that should 'obviously' be allowed. I resent that, abortion is a really serious matter where you are terminating something that is a little too close to being a human for comfort and not a clear issue. I think they got the idea of Courtney B. Vance as being completely for the killings, and proactive with them sometimes, and that idea was great. At first one of the girls was against them, however she reversed it way too easy IMO. I think they should have kept her on as being the one who didn't like the idea.

It's a very nice story, but then again there are some things in the story that are completely unnecessary (like the love between Paulie and the Jew.  Etcetera.  The first half hour is very good and deserves a 10 out of 10, but other parts are just so bad that they deserve no points at all.  Very strange.The main story of this movie is great a group of young people invite someone over to dinner on sundays, but one night the guest seems to have some fascists ideas and gets killed more or less accidently.  The group is convinced by the black guy that they did a good thing (he said that maybe this guy had become the second Hitler if they hadn't killed him) and they decide to invite people with extreme opinions every sunday.  If they can't convince him to change his mind, they'll kill him.  Of course this leads to a lot of problems inside the group. Some things in the story aren't worked out very well (like the kidnapping of the girl Jenny and what it has to to with the group) and some things don't matter at all, but in general it's a great idea and a nice story.I can't talk about acting unless I talk about the characters first.  The characters are one of the bad things in this movie they constantly change their minds and are all developed in totally different ways.  This is probably caused by a minor directing fault you don't really know how much time passes when the director decides to speed the story up a bit.  According to the images and the weather about three or four months have passed (at least I thought), but according to the bodies in the garden it's only 10 weeks.So you don't know very much about what happened in between and what could have changed the characters, you can only see that they have changed.  This way it looks like they've gone totally mental, when the director could have slowed down things a bit and thus could have created psychological depht instead of an almost psychopatic change of mind (example de zwarte).  It's also quite unrealistic that the person who didn't want to do it at all the first time they talked about inviting someone over every sunday becomes one of the most fanatic killers, and it's certainly unrealistic that she changes her mind again later on.As an actor it's of course very hard to play these characters. Cameron Diaz is quite convincing, the one with the broken arm however, was just plain irritating.  Because there are so many actors on screen at the same time it's hard to focus on individual acting, and all I can say is that near the end, the actors seem to have less and less fun and are just trying to get this over with.But of course this is a comedy, and you normally rate a comedy on how much fun you had.  The first half hour was very funny and had original jokes with a good level.  Not like Jim Carrey pulling faces, but the type of humor that leaves you rolling on the floor without attracting all of your attention so you can still focus on the story (Example the group discussing while Jude is trying to pull a knife out of a murdered guest).  You see this in a lot of quality comedy's and it's nice to see it in an American movie instead of the usual tasteless sex jokes like in Deuce Bigalow or Me, Myself & Irene...The crew started out with a great, but they ran out of ideas at the end and that way the movie loses its rhythm. Some bad acting and lousy characters without any depth or realistic development add to the feeling that you saw an amateur movie.  But anyways it was good fun and it's a source of discussion (what would YOU do when you would sit in front of Hitler with a knife in your hand?).

Most people have a set of ideals and wish to live by it. The question is are you just going to cherish your ideals, or are you going to act by them? In this movie, the problem is at first being discussed, by thinking of a virtual situation and how you´re going to act in it. For example you meet Hitler when he´s still very young and is still far from the man he is in WW2. Yet you know he´s going to kill several millions of innocent people. Are you going to kill him or not? After a group of liberal students accidentally kill a racist, this question is more acute to them as ever, and eventually they decide to act they invite people with extreme opinions for supper, try to persuade them, and if it fails, they kill them. However, after a short period of time, the supper gets shorter and shorter and there´s hardly any persuading left. Actually, as an outsider watching the film, you notice that some of the students themselves somehow start to resemble their victims. Some actually seem to enjoy the killing, while others start to get into more and more trouble with their conscience. Eventually this ends into a climax when the TV-top-extremist they invite turns out to be quite a nice and not at all extreme man. The moral is quite clear yes, sometimes you must stand by your ideals by acting by them. However if you believe in democracy and liberality and things like that, everyone is entitled to have an opinion of their own and you don´t have the right to silence them all you can try to do is convince them.

As a meal, THE LAST SUPPER hopes to serve up food for thought, but proves to be more fast food than grand cuisine. And, before we end the lame and obvious food metaphors, let's just say the film has a meaty premise, but is hard to swallow because it is half-baked -- okay, three-quarters baked.The plot is simple five rather smug and pretentiously liberal graduate students in Iowa, the heartland of American conservatism, have a weekly ritual of inviting a guest to Sunday dinner so that they can have philosophical conversations about politics. Apparently meant to be self-indulgent and self-congratulating chatter more than real debate, the intellectual hour goes astray when an unexpected guest proves to be a far right lunatic who expresses his sympathy for Adolph Hitler. Before the dessert gets served, it is the guest who gets carved up and the new Sunday night ritual becomes supper and a homicide. After some superficial debate, the housemates decide that they would be doing the world a favor by disposing of potential Hitlers before they became real life Hitlers. It is liberal activism taken to its not-necessarily-logical extreme.Their guest list (of cameo guest stars) begins with the lunatic war vet (Bill Paxton), a homophobic priest (Charles Durning), a male chauvinist (Mark Harmon) and an anti-environmentalist (Jason Alexander), but quickly degenerates to lesser villains (played by lesser actors) that include an anti-abortion activist, a librarian who dares to object to The Catcher in the Rye and a virginal teenage girl who doesn't approve of sex education in school. The checklist of villains (in rapidly declining order) is obviously meant to show how easily the power to destroy can become indiscriminate and, indeed, addictive.The film has been deemed anti-conservative by some because the supposed heroes are lefties and their victims are from the right and, at least at first, espouse only the most extreme notions of conservatism. But the point is that the various dinner guests do not represent typical conservative thought, but are grotesque caricatures of right wingers. The war vet -- seen through far left eyes -- can't be just patriotic, he has to be a crazed fascist. The priest can't merely see homosexuality as a sin, he has to be virulent in his hatred. The anti-feminist has to be a proponent of rape. Etc., etc., etc. The quintet of killers are not heroes or even anti-heroes, or even psychopaths, but clean-cut, well-educated, well-intentioned typical liberals who become drunk with their own sense of self-righteousness. Their hunt to destroy future Hitlers blinds them to the reality that they are the future Hitlers. For what was Hitler, but a man who thought he could build a better society by eliminating the undesirables? The right-wing victims are such obvious caricatures that they do not inspire anger or hate, but uncomfortable humor, not unlike guest stars doing a skit on Saturday Night Live. The weakness -- or perhaps the point -- of the left wing assassins is that they are so blandly uninteresting as individuals. This preppy death squad -- Ron Eldard, Cameron Diaz, Annabeth Gish, Jonathan Penner and Courtney B. Vance -- are so homogenized and banal as individuals that they only can be moved to action as a group. The message is that Hitler alone couldn't accomplish much, but a group willing to rationalize any atrocity as a means to a just end is the real danger to society.It is as a critique of modern liberalism in the era of political correctness that the film is boldly, almost brazenly, sly. The groundbreaking liberalism of the 1960s, a call of dissent in the name of openness and equality, has slowly faded into the background. Diversity has become the liberal buzz word, but it is, literally, skin deep diversity, not diversity of thought. It is said that we become that which we hate the most and as such liberal idealism has increasingly become a dogma of intolerance, double standards and self-indulgence. Liberalism is no longer the antithesis of conservatism, it is the mirror image.Of course the basic message of THE LAST SUPPER could have been told as well, but differently, with the political roles reversed. Indeed, had the film been made in the 1960s, I suspect that it would be conservatives serving the wine to liberals -- and I suspect that the film would have been satirically sharper and more outrageous. Certainly, in that case, the film's casual religious symbolism might have made sense, religion being a favored main dish to the right. But as is, THE LAST SUPPER's attempts to mock religion seem like a lame afterthought -- an ill-considered seasoning, as it were.The film is better as a concept rather than a story and lacks a punch. Instead of being spicy or zesty or deliciously decadent, THE LAST SUPPER seems to be served up as something that is good for you, nutritious rather than satisfying. Especially the finale when the last Last Supper is with a conservative talk show host played by Ron Perlman, who may or may not be the Hitler that the we are taunted with throughout the other meals. Just desserts are served up with an ambiguous twist that is as jiggly uncertain as Jell-O.

Five liberal room mates -- Diaz, Eldard, Gish, Penner, and Vance -- at a university in Iowa share a full-course meal in their home with a young man who reveals himself to be an unashamed macho war monger. A fight breaks out and the guest easily overpowers the wimpy hosts but is stabbed in the back by one of them. The victim burps, falls to the floor and dies.For the most part, the instrument of the deliberate murders that follow is poisoned wine. Let me recount the names of some of the right-wing victims Bill Paxton is the dedicated warrior; Charles Durning as a minister who thinks queers deserve to die of AIDS; Mark Harmon as the ne plus ultra of male chauvinism; Jason Alexander as a man devoted to despoiling the earth; Pamela Gien as a librarian who thinks that Catcher in the Rye is pornographic. She doesn't drink so she has to be stabbed in the back.But this is the kind of comedy that doesn't need an excess of gore to be funny, so there is no gore at all. The ludic element lies elsewhere -- partly in occasionally clever but noetic unknowables. Example If you were alone with Hitler in 1929, knowing what you now know, would you let him live? Partly the humor lies in ancillary themes. The Gang of Five decide to bury their first victim in the back yard, resulting in a suspicious-looking mound of earth. They put a tomato plant on top to disguise its contours. Eventually they have half a dozen huge tomato plants growing on the graves and there is a super-abundance of red ripe home-grown tomatoes. At first they can the tomatoes but the cabinets are finally filled. Then they slice them and hang them up to be sun dried. The tomatoes keep coming and getting bigger. They begin skeet shooting the tomatoes. They swing at them with baseball bats. Their last supper is spaghetti with marinara sauce. Another scene has Carmen Diaz planting pansies around the borders of the graves but it simply make the place look more like a cemetery than ever. (She gets PO'd when Vance rips them out.) And one of the roomies is a painter. He recreates, in a monstrous manner, Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam from the Sistine Chapel. On the dining room ceiling. (It should have been Da Vinci's The Last Supper.)They run into trouble when they manage to persuade a rabble-rousing, right-wing TV maniac, Ron Perlman, to have a good meal at their home. During the dinner, before he is served the dessert wine, he cheerfully admits that he only rants on television because of the ratings, that in actuality he is full of crap. He thinks both extremes are dangerous and that centrists control government and always will. And if he met Hitler alone in 1929? No, he wouldn't kill Hitler. (The hosts reach for the dessert wine.) Instead, he would do his best to talk Hitler out of his designs. The connivers hesitate, then scurry outside for a discussion.Left alone in the dining room, the phony right-wing nut job lights a cigar and wanders around. He's about to pour a glass of the dessert wine but it smells funny to him. Then he picks up a local paper and reads an item about all the missing locals. The penny drops and he stares back at the bottle of poisoned wine. Lieutenant Columbo should have such intuition.It's all kind of amusing, so why isn't it funnier than it is? Great material, nice photography and lighting, and no clunk performances, but I kept thinking what Ealing Studios might have done with this plot in the mid-1950s. There would have been less extravagance in the performances for one thing. The room mates keep arguing and shouting at one another, leading to a scene in which one is about to shoot another with a magnum. There would have been fewer victims, probably, and more comic elements attached to each murder. Some of the victims are hardly seen, getting barely enough screen time to say a few words before their demise. There is discontinuity in some of the characters too, and it stands out. Carmen Diaz is flippant about the first murder but anguished for no reason by the last. Except for Courtney Vance, Jr., who remains consistent, their positions through time are erratic. And sometimes the mood shifts violently without justification.But, these qualifications notwithstanding, I kind of enjoyed it. I still wish it had been made in the mid-50s by Ealing, but it's kind of fun, and welcome relief from most of the garbage showing up on the screen lately.

All the characters and their views are far too shallow for that. I think the goal was one thing and one thing only - the moral of the story. And, to interpret the moral of the story, you have to understand the ending. I think there are several plausible interpretations.The most obvious is that they got what they deserved. They committed murder and they deserved to pay for it. That's nice and clean and follows the format for a million other movies.Another option is that they became the very thing they had grown to hate - that being the intolerance of others.A third option is that they had their chance to kill Hitler, but they were unable to see Hitler in front of their eyes. The point being that the Hitlers of the world survive to commit crimes because people fail to see their evil until it is too late - as it was for them.A fourth option is that all the extremists in the movie die except for the one person who walks the political fence. The point being that the only way to succeed (or even to have a meaningful message) is to manipulate the audience.A fifth option is that they weren't murdered at all. He couldn't have known the wine was poison. He simply didn't want to take any chances. The point being that if you play with fire, you will get burned. And, in his case, the more perceptive and inquisitive you are, the better your odds of survival.As to the movie as a whole, it was very average. The acting was generally weak to non existent. However, Ron Perlman was excellent as the lone survivor. A few of the worm feeders were relatively good too. But, ironically (and perhaps not coincidentally) the 5 primary actors sucked. They really did. I honestly wonder if they didn't cast a bunch of weak actors in those roles JUST SO they would show how pathetic their killing rationale was as a balance to the pathetic political rationale of their victims.

The premise actually is quite fresh, and the film definitely has some flair to it.  The group of college graduate school leads are all personable and believable in their roles, yet none of them have any real depth.  Cameron Diaz is playing one end and for no reason starts another end of personality.  This Jekyll and Hyde type acting resonates throughout the performances of the five liberals that decide to do something and act like conservatives by killing those that disagree with them.  The rules they choose and use for their killing ventures are interesting and much of the story has a philosophical/political twist.  I do, however, wonder how the film would have been taken if it had been done, as one other reviewer noted, with the roles of conservatives and liberals changed.  It does seem, to use another well-worn cliche, that what is good for the goose certainly would not be good for the gander.  Anyhow, the film is fun and entertaining.  The guests that end up dead and buried are the most fun as we see the likes of Bill Paxton, Jason Alexander, Mark Harmon, and Charles Durning hamming it up.  Durning gives a great performance as a priest.  Nora Dunn also gives a nice, smooth performance as a local law person.  But acting kudos go to Ron Pearlman as a loud-mouthed tv conservative that seems to be extremely moderate in person.  Pearlman has some great lines and does some of his finest acting here.  the end of the film left me grossly unsatisfied.  I wasn't a 100% sure what the director was trying to do.

This plan starts well but the focus and ideals of the group drifts somewhat.This wants to be clever and dark and intelligently funny and for some of it it is.

What an outrage!) and almost is enough to drive the film.  The slide of the group into extremism is good and you think that the film's point is that extremism is bad and the middle ground is always the greater good.  Norman Arbuthnot seems to back this up but the conclusion is weird and seems to say that Liberals need to stay on their ground and not give anything away lest they be defeated &#150; how very Hollywood.  It's a shame because this messes up the whole idea of this being intelligent or thoughtful.The casts are colourful and well known but not all that good.  The main group are very one dimensional and very unlikeable.

And none of the group manage to be `characters' to the degree that I found anything to like about them.  The `victims' are also mainly caricatures of the political ideology they inhabit &#150; but at least the majority of them have some points to make rather than just going against everything &#150; this is more the case towards the end where the victims become less worthy of death.

The dinners continue, with guests expressing more and more outlandish opinions. Some are not jerks, such as the sweet teenage girl who believes sex education should not be taught because family values are more important. And then there is wacko TV commentator Norman Arbuthnot, who may go into politics but probably shouldn't because he appears to be as demented as Hitler. Meanwhile, the students begin arguing more and more, while the garden never looked better. It's a special fertilizer they're using.If this is a comedy, it's a very dark one.

Actors are puppets brought in at the very last moment to provide air to inflate the balloon. Yes, you humor, even encourage them, but relatively speaking they are mere tokens. In this case, we have the writing moved from outside the movie to on-screen. Our gang of five graduate students become the determiners of what happens, who lives and dies, Our guests are actors, literally dumb yobbos who (except for the last guest) grasp a role and play it because that's what they are given.Virtually no one has a political opinion determined rationally, we are all actors, victims of what is written. That's the point here. As the story goes, there are twelve deaths (counting the girl and the cop) to align roughly with twelve apostles present at the last supper. The thirteenth presence at that meal was the Great Actor. So actors win this round, as they always will in politics and religion.This movie isn't as dumb as you think. That's the point.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.

Do you kill him? A hypothetical question becomes real for a group of friends (Cameron Diaz, Ron Eldard, Annabeth Gish, Jonathan Penner, and Courtney B. Vance) that inadvertently have a gung ho ex-Marine (Bill Paxton) for dinner.They decide that the world could be a better place if they removed some of those who pollute it with their thoughts, words, and actions. Come on, you've probably thought of the idea too. Wouldn't America be a better place if someone had gotten rid of a few right-wing nut-jobs before they could do serious damage to the country? They choose one each Sunday - anti-gay (Charles Durning), anti-literacy (Pamela Gien), anti-environment (Jason Alexander), etc. - you guessed it, until they come up with what they consider the ultimate prize - a Rush Limbaugh type (Ron Perlman) that causes them to pause. Is he really bad, or just out for money and publicity? Is that a bad enough reason to kill him?The answer and ending were a perfect ending to a funny movie.

They are all nicely politically correct, liberal of course, highly educated, artsy, with no real discernible income but yet live in a wonderfully beautiful house in a rural setting.  It'd be interesting to see the reaction were a nice, young, attractive group of conservatives were shown killing those they disagreed with in exactly the same plot--I'd suspect the howling would be deafening even seven years later. But this is a left wing death squad, so I suppose for Hollywood, it's okay.Of course this death squad doesn't do things messy, they don't put people in gulags (like Stalin) or grab people off the street and put them in vans only to be thrown out of planes over the ocean (as in Argentina); no these folks are a yuppie death squad--they kill over al dente pasta and a nice rich merlot.  But of course the point is the same--to kill one's political enemies when they simply refuse to agree with you.The plot is certainly interesting, in that it has complexities that are worth considering The liberal group becomes increasingly agitated as it goes on with its grisly business, in strangely different ways. In one scene, they laugh delightedly over the death of a cleric, yet are horrified when one of their own seems to be dying accidentally.The group moves from the obviously guilty racist, gay hater, priest, pro-lifer to the more dubiously guilty The poor woman who simply doesn't like Catcher in the Rye and the police officer.Ron Perleman, as the archconservative Rush Limbaugh style talk show host, puts in a wonderful performance, mostly because I'd guess he's got the most to work with.  Most everyone else has only a one note part--in particular the liberal death group are incredibly vapid.  It's hard to know whether they are written that way on purpose, or simply because the writers simply didn't think they were vapid--just really the way people ought to be. It'd be nice to think this was part of the irony, but the ending tends to contravene that notion.The culmination is bizarre, in fact, worthy of some weird extremist group It implies that the real problem with this death squad was that they were insufficiently ruthless in their quest, in their decision to kill. The disappeared in this movie are, by and large, cartoons of their real life counterparts--which is of course the first thing one does before providing reasons to indulge in despicable acts demonize them as less than human, as ultimately evil, subhuman.As before, this movie would be held up as a horrifying example of intolerance if it were exactly the same, yet the politics were entirely reversed.  Worth seeing to see one of Hollywood's instances where their real extremism shows through.  "}]
