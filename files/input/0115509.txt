For certain children that come to mind that believe cats are evil, no-good animals out to serve witches and devils, this does not help. To cast the cat as an average villain is one thing. But to cast it as the Devil himself?! I mean, if the plot were turned around, would they cast the dog as the Devil? That point aside, I didn't care for Charlie Sheen as Charlie B. Barkin and Itchie's one liner role really didn't cut up. Annabelle lacks any spunk, as she had in the original. There are certain scenes and songs that touched me. Such as I Will Always Be With You. And the end scene was sweet. I did approve of the Guardian Angel theme, while I didn't agree that Earth would be better than Heaven. 3 out 10!

The haunting music and delightful characters are gone, now replaced with tacky animation and an unimaginative plot.The Pros Charlie Sheen is sometimes fun as Charlie, but he lacks the charming tough guy attitude that brought him to life by Burt Reynolds. I did particularly enjoy the songs I will always be with you and It's too Heavenly here.The Cons There seems to be no connection between this and the original. In the beginning Charlie is chums with Carface, but wait a minute. Isn't this the same character who was responsible for Charlie's murder and kidnapped the sweet little orphan he loved? I guess that all changes in Heaven but why isn't Anne-Marie even mentioned? If Itchy makes it to Heaven, wouldn't Flo and Killer make it too? What is with Annabelle the whippet's voice? In the original it sounded feminine and charming and in the sequel it sounds like a whiny, bitchy, parrot. The new characters aren't all that great (except Sasha). And the animation is better compared to a generic Saturday morning cartoon. The constant cartoony humor is flat and unfunny and the heart just doesn't work when compare to the original, which had such a moving unsubtle touch that makes me cry every time.All Dogs go to Heaven is one of my all-time favorite films. How Don Bluth allowed this sequel to be made is beyond me.BOTTOM LINE Not all sequels go to Heaven.

I did feel it was a little too dark for children, but it was beautifully animated and moving. This sequel is definitely inferior in comparison, but there were a few redeeming merits. The animation is not very good, there were a number of colour changes and very flat backgrounds, and I felt that the animation on Red was a bit too frightening for children. The songs were very pleasant, especially I will always be with you, but not memorable. Then again, neither were most of the songs in the original. I did like the singing voice of Charlie, provided by Jesse Conti, not so much Charlie Sheen speaking-it just wasn't Charlie. Also Sheena Easton was lovely as Sasha; if you want to know a little more about her, she sang A Dream Worth Keeping(FernGully) and Now and Forever with Barry Manilow.(Pebble and the Penguin, which I like more than this to be honest)I loved Mark Watters' incidental music too. I liked the character David, but I found Anne Marie a lot more likable, I cannot watch the end of the first film without getting teary-eyed. Likewise with Carface, Vic Tayback was definitely better, but Ernest Borgnine did a very good job with the voicing I felt, but Carface lacked the calculating manipulation that made him so memorable in the original. Bebe Neuwirth's Annabelle did little for me too, I preferred Melba Moore's angelic interpretation. Now another flaw, and the main flaw, was the story. It was a good idea, with some neat subplots, but it was told way too fast. The studio should have focused on accuracy and detail rather than piling on rushed subplot and another. Now for the main villain Red, a bit too frightening for my liking, but I liked his song, with the Spanish flamenco like rhythms. George Hearn did more than adequately with the voicing,very menacing at times like in his song, but I felt he was out of character. I wouldn't initially associate Hearn with villainous roles. A more inspired choice would have been Tim Curry, as long as they didn't make him do a phony accent that they tend to burden him with. The script wasn't bad, but it did need a lot more work, whereas Borgnine and Dom DeLuise provided the laughs, Sheen and Easton were a little less convincing. In conclusion, a disappointing sequel to one of the more memorable Don Bluth movies, but it is not as bad as the Secret of NIMH sequel, which was so awful I didn't know what to say. 6/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"Story Line Was Bland and this film has too many mistakes","Date":"7 August 2007","Score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family","Review":" First, they ruin it with the uniquely bad animation quality, then, they get voices that sound nothing like the original.

Add Dom DeLuise from the first movie and you'd think this would be a decent mix to make this sequel at least relatively decent compared to the first one.Unfortunately even with the addition of other good voice actors such as Bebe Neuwirth in the horrible role of Anabelle, this movie cannot be saved from the atrocious production values and animation skills (or lack thereof) present all over this movie. Horrible editing, syncronization of the voices, and flat out spaces where characters mouths should be moving to dialouge but are not combine to make this movie look like a college interns animation project instead of the decent sequel it could have been.All in all i'd say unless you were a very big fan of the first movie i'd give this a very large PASS.

But he's 6 years old and looks at this film as Oscar material, to be honest I wasn't expecting much since I was very satisfied with the way the first one ended. While I agree that this was not any where near up to par as the first one I still thought that this was a cute movie. As far as sequels go, you have to admit that All Dogs Go To Heaven 2 is better than most. The voices were actually closer than usual and the story was still pretty charming. Even though the first one seemed to have an official conclusion, this was just a new introduction for those little one's who might have missed All Dogs Go To Heaven.Charley has a new friend in Heaven, Itchy is there to join him. But Charley is getting a bit bored with the whole purity and typical days of being there. Carface has won an award for being the most turned around angel and it seems like things are working out for him, only he's really after a horn to give to Satan, or at least the Satan of dogs. But when Carface drops the horn, it goes down to Earth, Charley and Itchy are sent to get it, but Charley is quickly distracted by a beautiful dog, Shasha, who is taking care of a homeless boy, David. Since Charley is an angel, they can't see him, until he finds out that Carface, who is also down on Earth, has a special collar that will make him and Itchy visible, but Charley should watch who gives him that collar, he might be expecting something more in return.All Dogs Go to Heaven 2 is over all a cute movie. Even though that it was silly and not needed, for the kids it worked very well. The animation is pretty much like the same, but the new characters are very sweet and lovable. It's just a sweet little family film and I feel the rating is a little bit harsh, but I understand for the fans of the original. Like I said, it destroys the point of the first one, but I'm not going to spoil that for you. But I would recommend for you to give this a shot, but it's OK to just stick with the first film, that ended the story just fine.6/10 "}{"Title":"This. Movie.

It's horrible. It's absolutely awful. They rush the characters to develop. Sasha, for example, begins singing about how you can count her out for love. And at the end, this seems more like a dramatic romance flick than a comedy-adventure film. They rip Charlie out of his character and replace him with a gushy, soft, but still rebellious version of himself.The humor behind Carface's character is just completely lost. He's a totally different dog. He doesn't have a cool voice anymore, he isn't that villain you love to hate anymore, he's just a wimp voiced by none other than Mermaid Man from Spongebob. Speaking of voice actors..Charlie has a completely different voice. And while it isn't horrible, I don't like it. It's terrible in comparison to the excellent job that Burt Reynolds did for the character in the first film. Dom DeLuise is wonderful as always, as Itchy. That character stays true, and that's why this film gets a 3/10. Purely because Dom DeLuise was still voicing Itchy.Oh, and my last complaint. I know Ann-Marie's movie was done and gone, she has parents now, etc, but did Charlie completely forget about her, or what? No mention at ALL of her in the second film. I mean, even a small mention from Itchy would have been acceptable. (ex. Charlie, we have to get back. You can't take care of every kid that needs rescuing.) Or something of the sort. I mean, he died living with her, she deserves some kind of mention.Don't watch this if you're looking for a wonderful sequel.

You have to pay real attention to the movie.I love this movie and I've always loved it more then the Original (I know this is VERY rare) Let me tell you my reasons why.1. The songs are much better this time around. I love them all dearly. The ONLY song that I liked (and I barley like it) is the song that Charlie and Annabelle sing when Charlie first gets into heaven. All the other songs are dull.2. The plot. The plot in the first movie was mostly about revenge...it wasn't nearly has good as the 2nd movie. It was nice to have Charlie fall in love with someone and end up being alive.3. Many think that this movie makes it seem Heaven is 'boring' which isn't true. The first Heaven was dull...there seemed to be nothing, but clouds and a area filled with clocks. In this movie you can do whatever you want anytime you want. I think Charlie doesn't like heaven, because he feels as if he is missing something(I think when he dies later on he'll be happier in heaven because at least he figured out what he was missing..which was love) 4. The cat is NOT the devil. How do I know this? At the end of the movie when Carface comes out from where he was hiding he asks where Red was. Charlie then says his BOSS wanted him back (Or something like that) If Red was the Devil...he wouldn't HAVE a boss. Nor would he get sucked back into hell (He was getting sucked up BEFORE Charlie blew the horn...so it wasn't because of that) Overall it was a beautiful animated film that I adored. There really isn't anything that I don't like.Don't get me wrong I love All Dogs Go To Heaven, but the 2nd one will ALWAYS be my favorite. "},{"Title":"They're Back!

In my opinion, the musical aspect of the film isn't the best I've seen from a film, but I can still remember the lyrics and the tune to this day. Reviews for the film have hounded it's continuous mistakes throughout the film, and changing of actors from the original. The organisation and planning of the film didn't help its potential, due to moving from one studio to another. Finances didn't help this film either from which is demonstrated from the overall quality of the animation. There are plenty of mistakes in this film, which has harmed its reputation. The actors chosen for each role, in my opinion, were sound choices despite some criticism choosing Charlie Sheen over Burt Reynolds. I'm my opinion however the film should've been better planned, organised and received better funding from MGM, then the film would've got the reputation it deserved. I believe it is full of character, which is why I remember it so well. The songs are good, despite irregularities, mainly focusing on I Will Always Be With You which is a beautiful and brilliant duet, despite Charlie's singing voice being clearly different. 7/10 is what I will give for this film due to its brilliant character and potential, despite the poor organisational planning leading to the mistakes evident in the film.

It appears to serve no purpose.Flaw #3 the lax security at the police station, where you can just wander in with a trio of dogs and have no one notice, and then have only one cop chase after you when it's realized that you're a wanted missing person.Flaw #4 cartoon dogs is bad enough, but there is really no need to incorporate all the preachy god stuff in there, it's pointless and a pathetic excuse of a movie.Flaw #5 The parents never put out an amber-alert for the runaway kid or anything?

This is one of my favorite animated movies ever and it puts the first one to shame. OK. gushing over. point is, i love this film.This is much better than the first for several reasons. 1. it's not nearly as dark. i had a problem with that. the first one kinda scared me. it was creepy, i didn't like the girl, and the puppies thing was weird. 2. the animation is so much smoother. the first looked gritty and gross looking, but this one has incredibly smooth lines that flow easily and that gains major points in my book. 3. the characters are much friendlier. i LOVE annabelle's new look and i think sasha, while i usually don't like the random addition of a love interest, pulled it off well. and David is a HELL of a lot less annoying then the chick from the first. 4. the music. holy crap is the music good in this movie. i've had these songs stuck in my head for 10 years. and that's just fine with me.I could keep making a list, but i feel you get the point. This movie is golden. if you want something to show to your kids, or you just feel like watching a good movie, pop this one in. you won't be disappointed. if i had to make one nitpick it would be that the villain was a bit lame. but that only makes it slight imperfection. If more animated movies were like this, i would have no reason to watch live action at ALL.So let's break the story down. Charlie doesn't want to be in heaven anymore. itchy dies and joins charlie. they both get sent down to earth after carface steals the horn of gabriel. they get some weird collars from an evil looking dog that carface introduces them too (they don't know he took it yet) and charlie meets sasha singing onstage (probably the only bad song of the movie) he then follows her back to find David a boy who ran away from home because his stepmom is preggers. he meets up with charlie, who since he's from heaven he can talk, uses their one miracle to let sasha talk too. and after convincing David he's a guardian angel, they're off to retrieve the horn. after a crazy scene at a police station, they do, and they go to make David money as a street magician. David sees how hard it is and wants to go home. but uh oh, charlie's collar wears out just after he finds love with sasha and goes back to get new ones. the dog gives it to him in exchange for the horn who turns into a demon cat. Carface kidnaps David for the horn and charlie goes to go rescue him. After a cool boss fight scene, Charlie wins, everyone is reunited, carface is sucked down to hell (don't worry, he's OK in the TV series) and anabelle lets charlie come back to life while itchy stays in heaven and they live happily ever after. that is unless you count the awesome TV series where itchy comes down to earth to help Charlie do good angel deeds. but that's a different story.This movie is just great. do yourself a favor if you're feeling down. Watch this movie. you DON'T have to watch the first. just stick with this one and it'll brighten up your day. guaranteed.This movie found its way to easy street. with a 9. out of 10.

Bluth is a genius, already kicking all kinds of balls in the animation genre before Disney did. I love Disney, but Bluth has some BIG cahones; dogs drinking, gambling and double-crossing each other, rats made super intelligent by animal testing, a young orphaned dinosaur leading his friends to Utopia while grieving the death of his mother. Heck, even Anastasia (a film I love by the way), took risks for just existing, and that was Bluth's attempt at being Disney! Yet, it is not only Disney that has suffered the rath of the unneeded sequel. 90% of Bluth's movies have had sequels, TV shows or both adapted from them, ALL without his input. Except for Bartok The Magnificent. The Land Before Time is the most known example, with 12 sequels and a show, and another sequel coming riding on the tailcoat of Jurassic World. Many people of the 80s and 90s are aware of the American Tail franchise. Ditto Secret of NIMH 2. Then there's the All Dogs go to Heaven franchise.OK, most people know there's a sequel, but there was also an Emmy winning show and TV movie. Also, a really fun PC game. Judge me.Why? Why do Bluth movies get exploited like this? I mean, I love Bluth and his work, but his movies weren't critical babies until Anastasia came along. I mean, they were well received, but made little money EXCEPT on home video... oh.ADGTH was one of the highest earning home video releases at the time, so it makes sense that somebody would take this unique little gem and milk all of its heavenly cloud juice. However, is the sequel, appropriately titled All Dogs go to Heaven 2, with Charlie's New Adventure added in some cases, really bad? In my opinion... no. It's OK. Not great, but watchable.The story starts off in Heaven where we see Carface (Ernest Borginine) having a shady phone conversation, before heading off to the Guardian Angel crowning thingy for perfect angels. Here we see Charlie (Charlie Sheen), the lovable rogue who redeemed himself by putting a little girl's life before his own. In a clever allusion to the song Let Me Be Surprised, Charlie exclaims he's bored with Heaven. When his best friend, Itchy (Dom DeLuise) arrives in the afterlife, he bemoans his boring angelic life. So it makes perfect sense when Gabriel's Horn falls from Heaven, that he (and a reluctant Itchy) volunteer to retrieve it.So after once again conning the Heavenly Whippet, who now has a name and is stupid as heck (Bebe Neuwirth), Charlie and Itchy are sent to Earth as ghosts to find the Horn, which has fallen because Carface, who for some reason got a medal for being top notch angel earlier, made a deal with devil-cat Red (George Hearn), who wants the Horn to open the Pearly Gates so he can capture all of Heaven's dogs and lock them in Alcatraz so he can make Heaven Hell, I guess? Charlie and Itchy end up at a club where Charlie is smitten with smexy Irish Setter, Sasha LeFlur (Sheena Easton). Being the Casanova that he is, Charlie attempts to put the moves on her, only he can't, because he's a ghost. So Charlie and Itchy meet Carface, who they don't know is still evil, find out he got a life collar from a friend, which, well, makes him alive. Cool concept. Charlie, despite Itchy's reservations, goes to this friend, gets them both a collar, and goes to swoon over Sasha, before the collar's power wears out the next day. Of course, the friend is Red disguised as a dog, who is going to use the collar to control Charlie into leading him to the Horn. Oh, and the Horn is forgotten... for now.As it turns out, Sasha is not interested in Shepherds and is looking after a runaway boy named David (Adam Wylie), who is feeling understandably gypped because his dad and stepmom are having a baby. So he runs off to become a magician. David thinks Charlie is his guardian angel, so Charlie, in order to impress his new boo, plays along. So in between looking for the Horn, helping the kid do magic tricks and getting him back home, defeating the evil devil cat thing and falling in love, plenty of stuff goes down.It's all entertaining enough, the acting and music are good, pretty damn good actually. The animation isn't as polished as the original, but it's serviceable for a sequel, despite the NUMEROUS errors. Carface is now a pansy, which sucks, but Red is fun enough. Itchy is still funny. Even though Sheen can't replace a role literally made for Burt Reynolds in mind, he does a good job. The story isn't too bad either. But why, why is it set in 1996 San Francisco when the original was set on the brink of WWII in New Orleans? How did Itchy live that long? Where's Anne Marie? (I get that little Judith Barsi was murdered before the original film was released, so I guess that was a nod of respect for her). Why does the film exist other than to make money? Why does Charlie trust Carface when he MURDERED HIM IN THE FIRST MOVIE???!!!! The original had a passion quite akin to The Lion King; yeah it was risqu√© but we have a story to tell and God damn you if you don't like it! ADGTH 2 is harmless enough and moderately entertaining, but when compared to the gritty classic like the original it's based on, it's like comparing wet kibble to dry. This sequel ain't Heavenly, but it isn't Hell. It resides in Limbo, and that's fine too.6/10.

Calling it a family movie is an overstatement.This sequel to Don Bluth's anti-Disney fable ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN is appealing but weak. The animation, when compared to it's admittedly better predecessors are colorful but falls short of the product they've come to expect. Combined with weak musical numbers (even with Sheena Easton lending her vocals) and even weaker characters and a lack of a better story results in a lively but completely forgettable fluff.A popular cats-list of voice actors including Charlie Sheen, Ernest Borgnine, Sheena Easton, Dom DeLuise and Bebe Neuwirth team up to provide a rather appealing star power to this weakling of an animated adventure. After the legendary Gabriel's Horn, which unlocks the doors to Heaven's Gate, is stolen, Charlie Barkin (voiced by Sheen) and his buddy Ithcy (voiced by DeLuise) go back to earth to retrieve it, where they also follow old buddy Carface (voiced by Borgnine), who happens to work for the evil cat wizard named Reginald (voiced by Tony Jay), who wants the Horn for himself.Two sub-plots are provided, but either one doesn't really help much at all. One includes a romance that goes on between Charlie and an Irish Setter singer (voiced by Easton), and the other, concerns the dogs helping a little runaway boy named David. The story is fairly weak, even considering the standards of weak non-Disney effort. Bluth will most likely find his way as a Disney successor, but he has hardly succeeds here. Even if he has a way of entertaining kids, Bluth has yet to discover the trappings to appeal adults. The result is a film that will appealing to the kids. Adults should stick to something else.Rating **1/2 out of 5.

The songs actually fit with the scene and they don't throw off the movie, and that's a good thing in my book. Something Disney needs to work on with their DTV garbage.One other thing I'm glad they didn't do was mention and/or have Anne Marie. It wouldn't feel right, and if you know what happened to Judith you might have an idea where I'm coming from. Plus David wasn't that bad of a character.
