Basically that it was awful and not worth seeing. To all those who have said such words I just have to ask, what movie were you watching? In my opinion Ishtar was a wonderful movie. It's about two grown men, whose only dream is to become great musicians but are so horrible that no one will have them but the tourist industry in Morocco. All the songs that these two, Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman, sing are written by Elaine May and I found them to be simply hysterical. Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman make a great team, with humor vaguely reminiscent of Woody Allen. This is one of the only movies in which you get to see Warren act in such a way. I would defiantly recommend it to anyone despite its poor reviews.

Unfortunately, this type of humor died out sometime in the middle of the television show NEWHART's run. Why? Read The Wasteland! I don't know! Ishtar works in the same vein as Billy Wilder and Preston Sturges. No, the jokes do not come out and slap you in the face... You have to look for them to find them. Needless to say, do not rent this if you want a cathartic, mindless jolt. However, do not slam this movie just because it isn't slaptick or screwball. (Which are the only kind of comedies made anymore!) Elaine May comes from the comedy team of Nichols and May (Yes, Mike Nichols! In fact one could argue that the comedy in The Graduate is bad for the same reasons as the comedy in Ishtar is supposedly bad.). This duo practically perfected the witty, acerbic brand of humor which is now completely missed and misunderstood but was used masterfully in this film. In the age of Saturday Night Live and Ace Ventura, a comedy of this sort most assuredly would bomb and continue bombing. Nevertheless, if you are sick and tired of being force-fed ridiculously bad, hackneyed comedy then I suggest renting Ishtar (then buying some Nichols and May albums and watching the Bob Newhart reruns on Nick at Nite). Oh... Carter was President when I was born by the way...  This is not nostalgia!

Start with two struggling musicians trying to make it big, who find themselves trapped in a circle of espionage and intrigue in a far away land.  Include some of the funniest text ever written for the big screen.  Add two of the greatest actors of our day, Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty, (both of whom are playing characters that could not be farther from the traditional roles that these actors have played, which was, I'm sure, a challenge in and of itself) and throw in a blind camel for good measure, and you have the recipe for a cinema classic. If this film had managed to avoid the negative press that it received early on, it would have gone done in history as one of the great comedies of the 1980's.  Now, everyone wants to be on the I hate Ishtar bandwagon.  It is truly unfortunate that this film has not received the credit that it deserves.Ishtar is not the most under-rated film ever, but it may be close.

Therefore, people expecting to see the most brilliant American comedy of all time were shocked and appalled when, instead, they got a glorified Cheech and Chong movie.Is this fair? Yes and no. ISHTAR definitely falls flat at times. There are some curiously lifeless moments and awkward scenes that reek of last minute re-editing. The movie is far from perfect. But it is often very funny, and features two terrific, underrated performances from Beatty and Hoffman.Watching Beatty play such a well meaning dim-wit is a real treat. And Hoffman is just as good playing an equally dense, overly self-assured jerk. Elaine May and Paul William's intentionally awful songs are hilarious as well. People who criticize the quality of the songs or Beatty and Hoffman's vocal talent are obviously missing the joke, as both are SUPPOSED to be bad.A pre-obnoxiously conservative Charles Grodin adds plenty of laughs as a CIA agent, while Isabelle Adjani does well in a deceptively complex role, which requires her to play it totally straight while engaged in completely ludicrous scenes with Beatty and Hoffman.Beatty and Hoffman's interaction while trapped in the desert is classic. One of the movie's funniest moments involves the wind kicking up after they have been told by Adjani that there is no wind in the desert. Hoffman asks, Is the wind blowing? Beatty answers, This must be one of those once in a lifetime things, like the glaciers melting. If you don't find that funny, you'll hate this movie.But if dry, silly humor is your cup of tea, and you can view a movie without being overly distracted by it's star power, then you just might enjoy ISHTAR. It doesn't always work, but I found it to be pretty funny, with a fair amount of really great laughs. Considering the barrage of moronic, unfunny Hollywood comedies that have come and gone in it's wake, ISHTAR should be considered a triumph.

I suppose it's part of cinematic pop culture to hold that opinion as a safeguard against being called a fool.The most charming quality of Ishtar is its consistently dry, tongue-and-cheek disposition. It offers brilliant insight to the types of people in the world that, despite the fact that to everyone else their talent is cheesy at best, continue to try and try.  Rogers and Clarke are the Every Men for that entire segment of the population with their songwriting musical act.Their third-rate, leisure-suit-wearing manager does his job by getting them a few gigs; the biggest gig of all is in Ishtar, a politically unstable Middle Eastern country. Which, of course, is unbeknownst to Rogers and Clarke, who are just reveling in their love of playing music. Their naivete (and sometimes outright stupidity) is a character unto itself, and plays brilliantly throughout the ridiculous adventure that they experience.I've seen Hoffman and Beatty in interviews joking about how they knew the movie was so bad that, instead of quitting, they simply got into the spirit by over-acting at parts. But, whether they know it or not, they were very REAL people, and THAT was the best part of all.

At the time, Ishtar was considered so bad as to be unwatchable. It was skewered and vilified so strongly that the critics rapidly drove it out of the theaters. Few--including me--ever had the nerve to rent the movie.It wasn't until roughly 10 years after its release that my in-laws introduced me to the comedic greatness that is Ishtar. To this day when I tell friends and family that I love Ishtar, it is somewhat like saying, enthusiastically, Hey, I just contracted leprosy! Such is the stigma that still lingers with this film.To the credit of critics, this is by no means a work of pure comedic genius.The movie has essentially one theme that works--the effortless cluelessness of Lyle and Chuck as the world's worst songwriters--and this is exhausted almost completely within the first 30 minutes. Still, it is a totally knee-slapping hilarious 30 minutes. The meandering remaining plot that takes them to Morocco for a singing gig and leads them to become CIA agents is what cemented the bad taste in the mouth of critics for time immemorial. This theme by the end of the movie is rather re-treaded and worn-out. We kind of want Warren and Dustin to just shut up by then.This second act suffers from a kind of Hope-Crosby wannabee syndrome, and the writing isn't up to the slapstick pedigree the movie had begun revealing quite hilariously in the first act. Considering this film came from the pen of Elaine May--of Nichols and May comedy duet fame--I would have expected more, but perhaps this movie spiraled out of her hands because of the oft-misunderstood first act. I could easily see studio test audiences handily rejecting it and thus twisting the movie's priorities out of whack.Still, Ishtar shouldn't be brushed aside as a mere footnote in movie history. It is worth watching for its true hilarity and the performances of both Hoffman and Beatty.

For the life of me, I cannot understand the critical drubbing it took upon its initial release. Admittedly, it did go way over budget, and none of that opulence is visible on screen (the film has a murky and washed out look to it, and its sets and locales are not particularly impressive) but this is a comedy after all, and so lives or dies based on the quality of its jokes and situations, not its production design. And on that level Ishtar not only gets by but succeeds wonderfully.Beatty and Hoffman play two dim bulbs who fancy themselves songwriters and pair up in an attempt to become the next Simon and Garfunkel. The tortured lyrics these guys come up with must be heard to be believed, and the scenes showing them working on their songs or presenting their act to audiences are some of the most screamingly funny ever committed to film. If for no other reason than to see these scenes, you should rent the movie.Perhaps the film might have been funnier (and better accepted by critics) if it had focused exclusively on the show business dreams of its stars. However, early on the two get a booking to play an extended gig in Morocco (that alone should tell you how bad they are); they get waylaid in the fictional Middle Eastern country of Ishtar where they become inadvertently roped into a shady CIA dominated plot having something to do with rebellions, arm shipments and military coups. It's all rather hokey and confusing - but deliberately so, in the best screwball sense. And through it all Hoffman and Beatty truly shine the bafflement on their faces and in their gestures as they are shepherded from place to place as dupes in a plot they don't understand is just priceless. Who would have thought that two such intelligent actors could play stupid so convincingly (either one of them, for example, would have made a preferable sidekick to Jim Carrey than Jeff Daniels was in Dumb and Dumber - his performance showed all the strain of a bright guy trying to force himself into a pose of ineptitude). Even more, who would have imagined that two such prima donnas could put their egos aside to work off each other so well and become a truly great comedy TEAM? No matter how crazy the plot may get, Hoffman and Beatty are never less than a delight as they hold down the center of the film.Oh yeah, and if that weren't enough, there's also the treat of the wonderfully droll and deadpan Charles Grodin as the CIA operative in Ishtar. He's the villain of the piece, but his beautifully underplayed exasperation at the exploits of the two stars makes you like him almost as much as you do them.So what are you waiting for? If you like a good, well done comedy with sharp performances and a kooky atmosphere, check out Ishtar today. Don't allow all those sourpuss, stone-faced critics to ruin your fun.

The story of Rogers and Clarke, two would-be songwriters a la Simon and Garfunkel is genuinely funny and worth repeated viewings just to catch all the gags and the intentionally awful lyrics. Paul Williams wrote the songs with the help of director Elaine May and they provide hilarity throughout the film.According to Leonard Maltin, the movie is structured like a Hope-Crosby outing with shades of 'Road to Morocco'. I have never seen a film in the 'Road to...' series so I have to take Maltin's word for it.Beatty and Hoffman play songwriters who meet one day and find they have the same dream. They both have tunes in their heads that distract them from their lives, their girlfriends and their jobs to such a degree that they pursue a songwriting career together. The trouble is that their songs are so bad, the lyrics so painful, that their agent (the late Jack Weston) can only get them booked in Morocco, bordering the fictional country of Ishtar.The story opens with a sampling of songs written by Lyle Rogers (Beatty) and Chuck Clarke (Hoffman). They range from the hysterical (She said, 'Come look, there's a wardrobe of love in my eyes/Take your time, look around, maybe see something your size.) to the insane (If you admit that you can play the accordion/No one will hire you in a rock and roll band.). In flashbacks we see how they meet and the events leading up to their professional partnership. It must have been May who, in an inspired move, cast Hoffman as the ladies' man and Beatty as the dense Southern hick. That Hollywood joke will last long after they're gone.Once in Morocco, they unwittingly become pawns in an overthrow of Ishtar; Lyle for, Chuck against. Or is it the other way around? Anyway, the story turns away from the songwriting plot and concentrates on blind camels, dopey CIA agents and Sheira Aselle, a left-wing beauty played by Isabelle Adjani. She recruits Chuck and Lyle to find her dead brother's map, and winds up having feelings for them both. Meanwhile, Jim Harrison, a CIA man played by Charles Grodin, convinces Chuck that Lyle is a clever Communist and pays Chuck for everything Lyle says. This eventually leads them out into the desert, hopelessly lost and dying of thirst. When things look their worst under the burning hot sun, Lyle turns to Chuck and says, My lips are on fire. To which Chuck replies, With my desire! Nothing keeps these two from possibly writing the next hit song. Therein lies the true surprise of this movie. It never goes in the direction you would think. There are constant left turns with riotous results.After an attempt to get some drinking water from a band of desert gunrunners (there is a hilarious scene with Hoffman pretending to speak several North African dialects as an arms auctioneer), the film ends with a shoot-out between our heroes and the CIA hit men who want these two 'messengers of God' out of the picture. With the help of Sheira and Abdul (their guide and hash connection) they overpower their pursuers and yell out, F*** you twice! for good measure.What the film may be telling us is that keeping a song in your heart at all times is a sure way to escape your troubles. No matter how bad things get, if you pursue your dream it will happen for you. In order to get their first live album produced, Rogers and Clarke make a deal with Jim Harrison concerning social reforms in Ishtar and the blessed map. The way these two sing, this seems to be the only way it could ever be produced.Although 'Ishtar' is more of a comedy than a musical, I felt it paid homage to a type of filmmaking that is not seen anymore. Even if the songs will never become standards, they are rather memorable in a demented sort of way (according to the end credits, the soundtrack is available). At least the songs fit into the story of the lives of these two guys. The songs from a movie like 'Down Argentine Way' were nothing more than musical interludes. I think the film succeeds on the levels of both parody and originality. It is definitely worth a look.Aside Does anyone have the soundtrack to this film. I would like to know how to get a copy.

First, you have two men who have no musical talent whatsoever. This is the shtick of the film but it doesn't work well. Such a musical team should have at least some possibility of someone enjoying their songs as professional singers. These two (Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty) have absolutely no talent and their casting as singers is way beyond an acting stretch--it just seems stupid. Second, Beatty's character in particular is awful. Who in their right minds would believe that he is an uneducated working stiff who's had jobs as an ice cream man, a gas station attendant and a factory worker?!? And, when he tells Hoffman that he's jealous of him because Hoffman is so good with ladies, it is just dumb....BEATTY of all people complaining that he can't get a girlfriend!?! Talk about ridiculous!! Third, it's a comedy...with Hoffman and Beatty?! Sure, Hoffman did TOOTSIE, but Warren Beatty and a comedy? What were they thinking?! Fourth, I think Beatty was supposed to be playing a Texan, as occasionally he had an exaggerated accent that sounded somewhat like a Texas accent. Beatty...as a Texan?! Yeah...right. So, at the outset the film just made no sense at all and you wondered if either Hoffman and Beatty were THAT out of touch or it was the director (Eileen May) who was certifiably crazy. My assumption is that both possibilities are true! Of course, for $5 million each, I guess I can understand why they'd agree to such stupid roles.The film begins with Hoffman and Beatty meeting and forming a musical team. Unable to get work as an act in America, their agent offers them a job in Honduras as well as the fictional land of Ishtar (in North Africa). They choose Ishtar and find themselves in the middle of a revolution. Beatty is recruited by the Leftists (probably since they'd seen REDS and knew his political bent) and Hoffman is recruited by the wacky CIA agent, Charles Grodin. Unfortunately, both have no idea why they agree to do what they're doing and it looks again and again like they'll be killed. Sadly, they seem impossible to kill and they have many wacky adventures. Sounds kooky, huh? Well, no...it's not. Instead, it all seems very, very forced and not all that funny. Who thought the CIA and revolutions and these two guys were funny?! Now, it's obvious from my review that I disliked this movie. The question, then, is this as bad as the reviewers said? Yes and no. The film is tolerable to watch (particularly if you think the CIA is the ultimate evil on Earth and are looking to confirm this). It is about as good as a second-rate made for cable TV movie. However, considering the film cost a hundred bazillion dollars and took director May decades to finish editing (or so it seemed to the studios who threatened lawsuits to get her to complete the film), the results are stupefyingly bad. This might just be one of the worst films made--dollar for dollar. Certainly not among the worst films ever made...but still quite bad. Only of interest to the very, very curious or those who enjoy pain...lots of unrelenting pain.

Instead, what they got was a pair of bumbling oafs - songwriters, no less - BAD songwriters, no less - who never even realize they're saving the world.In a nutshell, Ishtar was too smart for the 1980s. It tried to rely on the hilarious twisting around of roles, from talentless musician to talentless hero, which didn't penetrate the audience. And the singing sequences, which had me in stitches, just bounced off the audience (which expected the lead characters to be very good but unappreciated, as they again couldn't fathom a movie without a hero.)The second thing that killed it was the bad press it got.

Everyone else is embarrassing, the most embarrassing being Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Beatty. There is such smugness behind this film and it reeks of it. This film didn't bomb because it had a huge budget. This film bombed because - wait for it - it was bad. Not funny. That's a problem for a purported comedy. So, to those who say things like, what movie did you see?

Of course the plot is insane, but I'd rather see these two guys doing comedy than, say, today's 'comedy hero' Ben Stiller and friends.This is top notch humor, the two huge stars are not afraid to totally get into the self depreciating humor and make the characters as silly, yet still recognizable as 'real life schmucks' as possible.There ARE people like that out there. The 'Chuck Clarke's' of the world, who despite everything going against them keep believing they are one day going to make it big because they're really misunderstood geniuses.Or the Lyle Rogers' of the world, who're always following in the footsteps of someone they actually buy into being 'great'.To Lyle, Chuck is someone to look up to, possibly because Lyle is so painfully shy and insecure not to mention - let's face it - borderline retarded, that anyone who can out volume his whispery speaking voice must be a person who knows exactly what he is talking about. Enter Chuck, who needs a (as he calls it) 'schmuck' like Lyle beside him just to feel good about himself. Of course the characterizations are greatly exaggerated, but who cares? It makes for one hilarious movie. Not forgetting Charles Grodin whose deadpan performances are always good for a laugh.'Ishtar' a bad movie?

Eventually, they get booked to perform in Morocco, where they end up getting caught up in political problems.I had heard a large amount of negative things about this movie, but I must say, that when I watched it, I laughed myself silly. How a movie like this gets so much negative criticism is beyond me, as I found it to be hysterical, fun, and downright entertaining. When I had heard that Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty where staring in this movie, I really became interested in seeing it. Just in 2013, this movie got a long awaited Blu-Ray release, and so I bought it. And when I watched it, I enjoyed every single minute of it. Seeing Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman perform these absolutely ridiculous songs is absolutely hilarious, especially when considering that although it is obvious that they do not have any talent as far as their singing and songwriting goes, the two of them believe that they are talented, and as a result, they come up with classics like Dangerous Business, Hot Fudge Love, and many more laugh out-loud outrageous numbers. And on top of all of that, while in Morocco, they get into a lot of trouble, and bring out a lot of laughs in the process.As I just said, there are numerous hilarious scenes to be found in this movie. Among them include whenever Beatty and Hoffman are performing, as their music is awful. Then there's a scene involving them with a blind camel, in which they end up causing trouble in a marketplace, not to mention the scene where one of them is attempting suicide and the other one is trying to talk him out of it. How somebody could not laugh at things as funny as these, I'll probably never know. I guess that considering the big name people attached it, and since it was Warren Beatty's follow-up to his 1980 movie, Reds, they were probably expecting a masterpiece, and when they didn't get what they were expecting, the Ishtar Hate bandwagon was born, and because of that, it ends up not getting the credit and the love that it deserves, although there are some who do like it.Say what you will about Ishtar, but I am standing by what I believe, this movie is hysterical. I wasn't expecting this movie to be like Reds, but I did find it to be hysterical and totally and completely enjoyable. If I was given the opportunity to watch this movie again, I would definitely do it, as it's got loads of laughs in it. Hey, even my family enjoyed it. However, if you do decide to give this movie a chance and watch it, then I would advise that you throw away whatever preconceived notions you may have heard about it, and keep an open mind.

No, that's not the latest Oliver Stone. Or CNN. It's Elaine May's 1987 comedy Ishtar, which the critics numbered among the worst films ever made. That's how far ahead of its time Ishtar was. Though she continued to write, even collaborating with Ethan Coen and Woody Allen on a recent Broadway omnibus, May hasn't directed another movie since. Now that the DVD release won positive reviews in the New York Times and here on IMDb, I'm glad to see the film is finally getting its due. In this film May combined the form of the Crosby-Hope Road movies with the spirit of Rob Reiner's 1984 mockumentary, This is Spinal Tap. Dustin Hoffman (Chuck) and Warren Beatty (Lyle) respectively play the Hope and Crosby song and dance men, but with two twists. First, May plays Beatty against his reputation as legendary stickman and denies him Crosby's romantic edge over the delusional Hope character. Here Beatty is shy among women and incompetent. His Lyle doesn't recognize a woman when he wrestles with her. Even when he holds her breasts. Astonishingly, the critics failed to pick up Elaine May's tongue in chic.Secondly, the men are terrible composers and singers. (But Beatty and Hoffman are brilliant in performing mediocrity.) This is where it draws from Spinal Tap. Like that group Chuck and Lyle have a musical ambition entirely incommensurate with their talent and sensitivity. The bathetic lyrics by May and Paul Williams emblematize the shallow sentimentality and naivety of American culture. A doo-wop trio sing I'm quitting high school cause you don't like me. Here Lyle neatly encapsulates the genre's cloying sweetness Hot fudge love, cherry-ripple kisses. Lip-smacking, back-slappin', perfectly delicious. Yet as Chuck lauds another Lyle banality, Shit man, when you're on you're on.This musical silliness shades into the film's political theme when Shirra Assel (Isabelle Adjani, playing the Dorothy Lamour role of exotic temptress) warns the smitten Americans that This is an ancient devious world, and you come from a young country. Promise me you will keep my secret without trying to understand it. By film's end the freedom fighter/terrorist has improbably grown misty-eyed over the clods. She flouts her cell to save their lives. In 1987, of course, the audience could still absolve a freedom fighter of terrorism.Our American heroes are completely unable to handle the area's politics, as the government, freedom fighters and CIA all resolve to kill them. That world is so dangerous that even a simple code -- say, I want to buy a blind camel -- can freeze into a burdensome reality. Their completely unfounded musical ambition and confidence are a desperate attempt to suppress their real sense of their own failure. They have their moments. The scene where Chuck is forced to to fake Berber lingo to auction off black market weaponry is a classic of Hopey bafflegab. He stumbles into effectiveness when he pulls a cry out of the very quality he needs to succeed here. Chuck stretches Chutzpah (yiddish for huge nerve) into Chutzpah-yi-yi! When an extemporized shriek carries such wit and weight you know the script is a work of masterful intelligence.And why wouldn't it be? It's Elaine May, the genius of those sharp-eared satiric skits she did with Mike Nichols. She wrote and directed those shrewd satires, A New Leaf and The Heartbreak Kid, and the brilliant Mikey and Nicky, where she outdid John Cassavetes on his own territory. Elaine May couldn't make a dumb movie. She had already worked with Warren Beatty on the script of his Heaven Can Wait (1978) and would co-write Mike Nichols' Clinton parable, Primary Colors (1998). But in its political satire Ishtar is closer -- indeed a companion piece -- to Nichols' Charlie Wilson's War (2007). The notorious Ishtar, far from being ineffectual, prepared for those later political satires and also, with its awful music and lyrics, the new genre of Cringe Comedy, like the Christopher Guest mockumentaries, the work of Ricky Gervais, and TV series like the transplanted The Office, Girls and Veep.

These five films are merely the most FAMOUS fiscal flops (alliteration!)There are DOZENS that equal and even surpass them. Ever heard of Mars Needs Moms? Precisely.Released (or more properly &#x96; escaped) just three years ago, THAT box-office bomb barely clawed back twenty of the one hundred and fifty big ones it cost to make.And back in the days of the Studio System, the number of films that are considered to be classics today &#x96; is equalled by those that just DISAPPEARED.The studios figured that releasing them would cost more in DAMAGE to their studio and stars than the bombs would net &#x96; so cut as much usable material (like battle scenes which could be used as stock footage) from them as possible and BURNED the rest.However now that the Studio System is long gone, EVERYTHING gets SOME sort of release.Thus Ishtar, which cost $55M to make (a big budget in 1987) was eventually released, netting just $7M at the US box office.But this does not tell the whole story. The worldwide figures are unavailable &#x96; then you have to factor in video, TV and latterly, DVD rights. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that overall, the movie is still a long way short of covering its production costs.These were worsened by the studio's insistence on giving the film high production values. The reason being that having heavyweights like Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty (who had championed Elaine May in the first place) on board, they were not about to scrimp it.Which is the film's first problem. Elaine had envisioned it as a Road To&#x85; movie (although it comes across more like those Sixties Bond spoofs &#x96; like Danger Route and Our Man In Marrakesh) with a modest budget, shot locally &#x96; not an epic, part-made in Morocco.Furthermore, the studio insisted on paying both its lead actors a fortune &#x96; while both would have been happy with far less.To make things worse, the political situation in North Africa at the time was TENSE.Then to cap it all, just as the film was nearing completion, David Puttnam (now LORD Puttnam) was brought in as the studio's new head of production. He hated Beatty, Hoffman and production cost waste in equal measure &#x96; and publicly condemned the movie on the basis of all three.And all along the way, there had been a plethora of problems and fallouts too numerous to mention here &#x96; all of which conspired to CAPSIZE the film before it had a chance.So what is Ishtar actually LIKE? Well, most of those who decried it never even SAW it. It is actually not that bad.Beatty and Hoffman's chemistry is pretty good, Charles Grodin is as funny as ever &#x96; and the blind camel steals every scene he is in (the camel originally signed for the part got eaten instead).Plus Paul Williams' songs are realistically awful (Beatty and Hoffman play bad singer-songwriters) Dave Grusin's score is fine, May's script and direction is okay (although after Ishtar, she never got to direct another movie) and altogether the film lopes along agreeably, never becoming boring (which is more than can be said for the other four films listed above).So if you find this piece in your DVD hire shop or it turns up on your TV schedules &#x96; give it a try. It may not be in my All Time Top Ten Movie list &#x96; or even my top hundred &#x96; but it is NOT as bad as many would have you believe.On its original release, it was well received at its three premieres, hit Number One at the box office during its opening week &#x96; and almost all of IMDb's 121 reviews (written by actual PEOPLE) are POSITIVE.And it is now available on Blu-Ray.I finally saw it a few days ago on DiggerMovie HD and LOLed many times (particularly during the scenes involving that camel). And as Elaine herself once said, If all of the people who hate Ishtar had SEEN it &#x96; I would be a rich woman today.

It became easy fodder for the critics, who seemed to revel in trashing the film in their reviews. At the time of its release, it became fun to make fun of Ishtar, which has become it's undeserved legacy.Actually, Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty are brilliant actors, and their performance as bungling and untalented show business performers really carries this film. The two characters are complete buffoons, and Hoffman and Beatty are quite believable as idiots. Unfortunately, the film suffers from its writing. The story is basically a remake of the Bing Crosby/Bob Hope road movies, and the stories in these films is now a cliché. The use of cliché is worsened by the use of Arab stereotypes and stereotypes of CIA agents, which litter the film. As a result, it is a little on the long side. But is it a bad film? No. It is quite watchable, and actually very funny. I give it a 6 out of 10. It's in the upper half of comedy films - but just barely.

The soundtrack is typical 80's elevator music trash. Cinematography is as barren as the desert scene on the box cover.

It isn't completely laughter-free though, thank goodness, the business with the vultures and Charles Grodin's bungling CIA agent have their moments, but everything else is just sorry and redundant and that is including poor Isabelle Adjani.Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman are both fine actors, but as the tone-deaf songwriters, they can't do anything with their characters or dialogue and their chemistry together is oddball and not in a good way. For me, there wasn't a single likable character, the direction was sluggish, the film feels overlong and dull in the pace and the story is unfocused and never comes alive.I didn't think much of the production values and music either. The production values are okay but did little for me, while the music is forgettable.

I've watched a few of his more recent movies where he played a comedic role, such as Meet The Fockers in which I would rate his performance as substandard to poor.The general plot of this movie has potential, but neither Warren Beatty nor Hoffman could deliver.I would recommend watching Ishtar only if you are stuck inside your house (alone) on a rainy night and you have nothing else to watch and not a book in the house.

That joke was my introduction to this movie.Ishtar is easily in my Top 10.  Every line in this movie is ingenious.  I could pause it constantly to relish how perfectly the dialogue AND the delivery embody the concept of these guys who are barely on the fringes of the entertainment business.  The actors don't ham it up, like many comedies featuring out-of-touch characters, but instead they nail the roles perfectly, as their characters sincerely hold on to something that they can't quite achieve (similar to concept behind the heroes in Mystery Men).In most movies, I find the characters are over-dramatized and the comedy is contrived.  In contrast, Ishtar could happen in real life - almost word for word.As someone else wrote on this page, if you don't laugh your head off at the opening scene, you're probably not the intended audience for this movie. The songs are great.  They are to Ishtar as the poems are to So I Married an Axe Murderer.  I would love to have the soundtrack if it exists anywhere. As a lyricist myself, I know something can sound great when written, but then the next day you realize it needs polishing or it should be scraped entirely.  But that realization never dawned on these guys.The movie could stand to be a bit more concise, but the enjoyable parts of this show far outweigh the scenes that drag on.

They obviously were ahead of their time in finding humor in the bungling of CIA and  siblings, Shiite mob violence, `Berber' factions, and bazaar chases. The humor is rooted in  the notion that all these goobs want to do is perform. The Army is rousted out to applaud by  command.

And yes, it's true! It's a terrible film. It's typical 80s badly written, ludicrous plot, bad acting, you name it, Ishtar has it in spades. And yet so much fun.The plot is two struggling songwriters take a trip to North Africa, one of them gets recruited by the CIA, the other by some local freedom fighters, hilarity ensues and then they release an album. Seriously, could a movie plot be any better than that? There's camels, bizarre songs and zany comedy.To be serious for a moment though, Ishtar represents a dying breed of movie. These days, 'bad' movies are either just dull and poorly written, or 'gross-out' comedies. No one makes truly bad movies any more like they used to. Ishtar is the perfect storm of wacky humour, outrageous plot and great acting by Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty.I'm giving it 7 out of 10 because I haven't seen it in years, and thus have nostalgic memories that I'm sure do not reflect how bad it actually is!

The film has taken on an almost cult status as indicated by its popularity as an internet download.If it was displayed in DVD rental store it would probably be categorized under 'Curios' because a curiosity is what it has become. Beatty and Hoffman are of similar age but Hoffman looked a good 10/15 years younger. A strong indication maybe that Beatty's chiseled good looks were fading fast. Isabelle Adjani looked as alluring as ever despite only part of her face showing under her Arab headgear. With her raunchy reputation preceding her it was with almost ironic self-mockery that she chose to reveal that she was a woman by exposing a breast rather than removing her headgear.Nice touch. There were not enough humorous scenes to match the one of Hoffman with the vultures which was delightfully underplayed. The bottom line is that it is worth a view if you have nothing else to watch otherwise strictly for the aficionados.

Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman play two friends who dream of becoming the next Simon and Garfunkle through their song writing. When their careers are at the bottom in America their agent sends them to Ishtar where they get involved in a Civil War. I'm not going to lie because I really loved the first thirty minutes of this movie. Seeing Beatty and Hoffman singing and dancing to various classics as well as songs written for the film kept a smile on my face and I laughed out loud several times. However, when the Civil War stuff kicks in the film goes downhill very quickly. I'm still not sure what all of this stuff had to do with anything and even when the film was over I was still confused about what it all meant. Isabelle Adjani is good in her role as the rebel but Charles Grodin, Tess Harper and Carol Kane are all wasted in their supporting roles. Once again, I loved the rather witty songs being sung by Hoffman and Beatty but I only wish the film had centered on this instead of going off in other directions.

While watching the stars - cast against type, with Warren Beatty as the shy, sensitive one and Dustin Hoffman as the cynical womanizer - making fools of themselves is decidedly an embarrassment, it does provide some undeniably amusing moments.The best segment is arguably the opening 20 minutes detailing the duo's pathetic attempts at hitting the big time in show business. The deliberately awful songs (courtesy of the ubiquitous Paul Williams) are quite funny. Conversely, the political satire involving intrigue in the Middle East is less appealing - though the antics of a blind camel and a bunch of ravenous vultures steal this part of the show.Charles Grodin (as a CIA agent) adds some class to the proceedings and Isabelle Adjani - The Lovely Lady Of The Left - is the most attractive Arab freedom fighter you'll ever see (her meeting cute scenes with Hoffman and Beatty respectively are early highlights). Still, the best joke is possibly the very last one after the untalented singer/songwriter duo have conned the CIA into funding their live album, its sleeve cover is seen finally gracing a record store window...but then the camera pulls back to reveal that it's being sold at a Special Low Price!

At some points of the movie it seems that playing against type makes their badness more realistic, unfortunately at other moments it makes each actor perhaps stretch a little too much.

Much to my surprise, I enjoyed it tremendously. I even came away with the deliciously horrible song, Telling the Truth is Dangerous Business, running through my mind. (The film's credits disclose that many of the music by the fictitious songwriters of the film were original songs written by famed Oscar-winner Paul Williams.)One of the reasons critics panned the movie so much could have been it was an enormously expensive, over-budget film. As a result people were expecting something spectacular, which it isn't. It is possible that a reason the panning was so severe was because the director is a woman, but I hope no critic used that as a basis for his opinion. I think female directors were rare at the time. Ishtar was directed by Elaine May, who by 1987 had been an established highly respected comedian. With Mike Nichols (before he became a major film director), her partner in comedy records, they have been said to have revolutionized the landscape of American comedy. So it isn't surprising to find that she displays in Ishtar her great sense of humor.How can I describe the kind of movie Ishtar is? It is, of course, a comedy, somewhere between a satire and a farce. But what kind of comedy? It certainly isn't a romantic or bedroom comedy of the Meg Ryan, Julia Roberts or Jennifer Aniston variety. Nor is it slapstick farce of the Chevy Chase or Steve Martin variety. What comes to my mind for reference comparison are the comedy recordings of the Elaine May, Mike Nichols duo (e.g.,the pay phone caller who lost his dime and is trying to get the operator to place a call for him), and the early Martin and Lewis movies. But the comedy style of the latter is totally different so I'm not sure why it comes to mind except that you have two guys getting into jams together. The second time I watched Ishtar it brought to my mind a Bing Crosby, Bob Hope film called Road to Morocco. Although the plots are totally different, Hope and Crosby could have played the lead roles in Ishtar. The film begins with struggling unpublished songwriters Lyle Rogers (Warren Beatty) and Chuck Clarke (Dustin Hoffman) trying to put together the lyrics and music to an original song. They are two schnooks who have harbored dreams of being songwriters since they were teenagers (which was very long ago.) Did you get the joke of the name of the duo, Rogers and Clarke? They are running out of resources and reluctantly accept a paying job their agent finds for them, but it is in the Middle East. When they arrive they immediately get themselves embroiled in espionage and revolutionary conflicts. Naturally a beautiful young woman, Shirra Assel (Isabelle Adjani), is involved. Even before they get out of the airport, one of the naifs is recruited by a CIA agent and the other by Shirra Assel, who's life is in danger. She is involved in a religious conspiracy to overthrow the evil Emir. A secret map and a legend that some day two strangers sent by God will arrive and lead a revolution is the main theme. There is also a blind camel, heroes stranded in the desert with too little water, and everyone trying to kill the heroes.One of the silent jokes in the film is that Dustin Hoffman, whose previous roles included Ratso Rizzo in Midnight Cowboy, plays a man women find interesting, while Warren Beatty, who has the reputation of a womanizer, plays a dork who's shy around women.

Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty play a couple of aspiring singer-songwriters with delusions of becoming another Simon and Garfunkle. What they don't even have a clue about, though, is that their talent is as thin as their ambition is lofty. The funniest scenes in the movie have these two hacks writing and performing their own works, actually some very clever stinkers written by Paul Williams, with screenwriter director Elaine May giving a hand with the lyrics.A sleazy agent (Jack Weston) books the duo in an out-of-the-way location--Morocco. Almost as soon as they get there they become unwittingly involved in a convoluted plot involving the CIA, freedom fighters and weapons smuggling. This is where the movie starts to head south. The story gets hard to understand (or care about), the characters get fuzzy (Isabelle Adjani's is a good example) and the jokes get less funny. There's still a laugh here and there but they are fewer and further between. Some have complained about Arab stereotypes. They may or may not have a point, but if it's any consolation to them, the American characters aren't much to be proud of either.I would only give this film the barest of recommendations, mostly because of some good comic moments created by Beatty and especially Dustin Hoffman, who has consistently proven himself an adept actor in comedy as well as drama. Elaine May's script is the main culprit here, I think, as the more involved the plot got, the more the film hit the skids. But 'Ishtar' is nowhere near the synonym for a cinematic turkey that conventional wisdom has made it into. If people don't like it on its own merits, that's OK, but to accept the word-of-mouth of those who have never seen the film is a shame.

I went and bought the movie (after a long search for anywhere that sold it) and it is now a tradition among me and my friends to watch it on New Year's Eve every year.Much like the movie Happy Gilmore, it's the bad acting that really makes this movie so bad that it's good.

How could two legends debase themselves with this garbage? This mind-numbing, C movie of an endurance test made me feel as if I was being lectured to and ignored all at once. The dialogue was trite and predictable. The plot was farcical and not even remotely believable. Warren and Dustin just plain slumed through this one. Beatty appeared wan and disinterested and Dustin was trying his best to enjoy himself and appeared to have no interest for the task at hand.Which brings me to Elaine MayWhy is it no surprise to me she was uncredited for everything from 1981 to 1995? I want to know if this was by choice or by condition? Why is it also no surprise to me that almost all of these films were ripped apart by the critics and barely managed to tread water at the box office? Some outright went under.To summerize Ishtar If you sit through this movie without hitting the fast-forward button or lying to your friend about having to go to the bathroom when you really don't, you'll never have to prove your courage in any other way.

Since I liked all the principals involved, I felt why not give it a try.No two ways about it, it's really bad. The premise, involving Beatty and Hoffman (like Hope/Crosby) is totally untrue to their talents, let alone their screen images,that is where this comedy falls flat. Hoffman can do comedy, Beatty, to save his life, can't. However, Beatty can play the piano and sing, where Hoffman is not as good. The 'funny' songs aren't in my opinion. The plot is like the old skits they used to have on Variety shows. Not to mention that it's pointless and embarrassing. As entertainment, it's a misfire that owes more to a bad Abbot & Costello than the 'Road' Pictures. It's all a shame.I got the sneaking suspicion that the stars probably had a better time making the movie than audiences had watching it. Talented people were involved in this and look what they came up with.However I can recommend it to those who watch TV all the time and manage to get a few chuckles on every show.

Ishtar's cast highlights include a wasted Isabelle Adjani and a number of others we've never heard from since (except for Matt Frewer, whose career could only go up after this mess).Elaine May (writer, director) wrote Heaven, which also starrted Beatty and Grodin, as well as Jack Warden. I'm convinced that there were many other minor-role players that were in both films, who all changed their names after filming Ishtar.Dave Grusin wrote the original music for Heaven as well as the forgettable, non-ethnic background annoyance in Ishtar (the ethnic side was written Bhajwa).At least Buck Henry had the sense to stay away from Ishtar.

I voted it to be one out of ten on the IMDb scale.  Can I give it a negative score?  Only about two minutes out of this so-called comedy is funny.  Rest of the movie is absolutely boring.  When a movie is so bad, it can become a classic.  Remember Ed Wood's Force Nine from Outer Space. The special effects and alien costumes were so cheap.  The acting (if you can call it acting) of Tor Johnson and Vampira were horrendous.  The story line makes Saturday morning cartoons look like Dostoyevsky novels.  However, when all these horrendous, shamelessly cheap and tacky elements are combined into one movie, the end product is something fascinatingly bad and unique; it is a timeless classic.  However, `Ishtar' can never be a classic like `Force Nine.'  There is nothing unique about it.  It is just plain boring.  (Those poor movie critics.  They had to sit through this torturously boring movie.)  The shortcoming of this movie is in its horrendous screenplay.  The talents of stars like Dustin Hoffman, Warren Beatty and Isabelle Adjani could not rescue this incredibly bad screenplay.
