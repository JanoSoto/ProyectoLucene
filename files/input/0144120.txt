An excellent fourth installment, at that. I was very impressed with this one, especially after the dullness of Part 3 that got me completely bored that I doubted that there would even be any more sequels. . . Boy, was I wrong. But it just seems that in Bride of Chucky you actually feel some chemistry going on between him and Tiffany. Not only that, but it always seems that in the Child's Play series you could never really tell if Chucky's dead or not, whether he's shot in the heart, exploded into bits of pieces, or hacked up in a huge fan.This film also includes some memorable scenes, for example, the stunning segment where that guy gets blown to bits by getting hit by that huge truck. Pure genius from the film's screenwriter, and creator of characters, Don Mancini.Yes, shocking was the movie, the ending especially. Some good dialogue, a great plotline, pulse pounding suspense, and a hard-hitting soundtrack, Bride of Chucky promises everything the previews do and may become a famous pick-out in the horror genre. Highly reccomended for die-hard fans of the Child's Play series.

But his ex-girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) gets his remains and (using Voodoo for Dummies) revives him. Then, through circumstances too convoluted to get into, SHE is killed and has her soul put into another doll! Together they fall in love and kidnap a nice couple (Nick Stabile, Katherine Heigl) to take them to Chuck's coffin to get an amulet to make Chucky and Tiffany real people again...A lot better than it sounds. After the last two sequels to Child's Play (both of which were horrible) I was expecting the worst, but this actually was lots of fun. The movie doesn't take itself seriously for a second (seriously--how could it?) and the lines and situations are actually quite funny. Also there are a few VERY gory murders thrown in to satisfy us horror fans and the film never stops moving. The movie also has a few things usually not found in a horror movie--a gay best friend (Gordon Michael Woolvett) who is intelligent and not played for laughs and a sequence in which Stabile has his shirt off just to show his muscular body. John Ritter has a nice cameo too as a sheriff.The acting is good--Stabile is young, VERY handsome and likable; Heigl doesn't have much to do but pulls it off and Brad Dourif (the voice of Chucky) and Tilly are hilarious as the murderous dolls. My favorite part is when the dolls have sex (don't ask) and she asks for a rubber and he responds, But I'm MADE of rubber! The special effects are good (no lousy CGI here) and this is one of the few horror films to mix humor and violence in an entertaining way. Well worth seeing. I give it a 9.

One of the main issues is the fact that there's an utterly perfect balance between the horrific and the humorous, as this combines utterly perfect laugh-out-loud moments, from hilarious one-liners to sight gags and puns, mixed in with the horror- centered areas present here. It's the comedy here that wins out for the most part, from the failed ceremony, the continuous references to the other toy dolls she has laying around and the utterly hilarious running gag of everybody's reaction to Tiffany and Chucky dolls throughout the film, though the greatest material is their quips and jokes to each other. These are truly gut-busting as the dolls begin conversing about being out-of-touch in regards to movie-killer practices and trying to instill the need for variety in the kills to be committed or in their relationship woes which sound like real, actual relationship arguments but come off as hilarious due to the nature of being said by plastic dolls. As well with the comedy, the horror elements here are wholly impressive including the extravagant visual flair found in many of the scenes here that readily turns this into a comedy, from the initial attack in the trailer-park house that gets her into doll-form as the distraction from the movie allows for the trap to be deployed which is just suitably perfect here. The road-trip nature here allows for the great traveling scenes as well, with the diner attack coming off nicely with the explosive reaction and general panic or the utterly insane kill at the motel which is really impressive here and gives this a spectacular centerpiece sequence. Even the finale at the graveyard is fun with the numerous stalking to get the upper-hand, the confrontation over the grave is fun and there's a lot to like with the great action in the big brawl here to finally end this. All of this means the pace is perfect with tons of outstanding encounters to keep the pace going strong with tons of high-energy action and plentiful gore provided by the outstanding kills here. As well, the film gets an absolute ton of positives from the stellar special effects work for the dolls, as this is an absolutely amazing part of the film. Given that this one spends as much time as it does here showcasing them on-screen, they need to come off flawlessly and they manage to come across as realistic dolls and puppets throughout here due to these perfectly conceived creations. Mixed along with a return to the more horror-centric side of Chucky, these manage to create an overall winning film. While there's a ton to love here, there are a few small, near-inconsequential flaws to this. One of the biggest is that it does tend to homage too many other films at times and feel more like it's actively trying to be funny or clever without doing anything important to the film trying to awkwardly shove the reference into the scene. This also bleeds somewhat into the other flaw, that the comedic one-liners are a bit much to get over and wear themselves out somewhat. However, since this one doesn't have too many real flaws there's so much to like here it becomes quite impressive.Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity, a shadowy puppet sex scene and some drug use.

So just why is this one the one sequel that I like out of all the others? Well a lot of good reasons come into mind.The film picks up about a month after Child's Play 3, where Chucky's remains are stolen by Tiffany played by Jennifer Tilly and she takes them back to her house and sews them together. When her wannabe goth killer boyfriend comes over, Chucky comes alive and kills the boyfriend in a very bloody death. It is revealed that Tiffany and Chucky were dating before Charles Lee Ray was put inside the doll. They at first are happy but Tiffany locks Chucky in a playpen because Tiffany was under the false impression that Chucky was going to propose to her. Chucky, Now raging mad, Kills Tiffany and puts her inside of a doll body. They take a couple played by Nick Stabile and Katherine Heigel hostage and plan to posses their souls.The first good thing is the story. I really like how they don't really go after Andy here and instead go after new people. However They at least could have mentioned him more than they did, at least more than a newspaper article. Also I love the idea of giving Chucky a bride so he can have another doll to interact with.The next is the Bride Of Chucky. Her character is really well done here and I like how Jennifer Tilly does voice Tiffany. The look of the Bride is pretty cool with the doll starting out as a wedding doll and then transformed in this goth/biker chick look. Plus Chucky gets lucky, twice. The first is, obviously when he gets married but the second is when he really gets Lucky if you know what I mean.The next is the special effects which are better than the last two. Chucky is now all scarred up and this look is pretty frightening but to be completely honest I found his appearance in the first film more scary, But I do love the look they go with and this look does continue into Seed Of Chucky.The last is the acting. Stabile and Heigel do a really good job and are believable as a couple, John Ritter, yes he is in the movie, does a good job as a dirty cop. But I want to talk about the dolls. The voice acting by Brad Dourif and Jennifer Tilly are great. Plus Jennifer Tilly is hot. Both in and outside of the doll.The Final Verdict for Bride Of Chucky is 4 Out Of 4 Stars. Great acting, amazing special effects, also not to mention the movie is extremely funny. My favorite quote is from Chucky and it was used for the title of the review.

Chucky is no more mister nice guy!BRIDE OF CHUCKY is a sinister guilty pleasure! The Chucky franchise earns its much desperately needed (and deserved) revision. Thanks to Ronny Yu's (who has directed so many Hong Kong martial arts films) direction and the wizardry of special FX make-up artist Kevin Yagher, Chucky is livelier...and deadlier than ever. Yagher does a great job giving Chucky such human traits and attributes. Chucky is one demonic and realistic character whom I would NOT like to run into in a dark alley! Chucky himself looks especially deformed, with the appropriate stitches on his face and everything. For a pint size villain, he packs one mean attitude! Also, the facial expressions of the killer puppets Chucky and Tiffany are so bizarre, yet wonderfully genuine. One fact for sure, I was impressed by all the elaborate special effects... Hey, you must also adore the cogent and delightfully deviant love-hate relationship between Chucky and Tiffany.John Ritter (!) is excellent (though unusually cast against type) as an uncompromising Security Chief Officer. Ritter should also earn an award for the best (and most unpredictable) demise. He certainly knows how to be dying in style! Brad Dourif really knows this Chucky character inside out. He delivers the wisecracks with impeccable timing before and after each killing. Alexis Arquette (THE WEDDING SINGER) is in top form as a Goth who encounters the devil doll. Jennifer Tilly is one fantastic, nefarious temptress.There's plenty of bloodletting in this pleasantly entertaining (and sleazy) thriller. Lots of gory murders abound to keep bloodhounds ingratiated. This grotesquely violent and sanguinary film will easily scare away the squeamish. In addition, there are lots of cool (and sometimes subtle) references alluding to other horror flicks. I also learned from this movie that a person should not take love for granted.BRIDE OF CHUCKY is an imaginative journey into everlasting terror. You will laugh and churn as you witness the brutal slayings as the consequences of this couple's rampage. If you appreciate dark, macabre humor, then this movie is perfect for you!

We had a fresh array of characters, a brilliant Cliffhanger and a new Killer Doll. The film really displays well how Chucky, like the rest of us, can have an relationship, and how he is still Human, despite being a Doll. Good examples of his Humanity are when he listens to music in the car, treats Tiffany like a House-Slave and has Sexual Intercourse with Tiff. These display that Chucky is a Human being, and while some fans disliked this, I say the film was pure comic genius, comedic and horrifying. Inventive new murders were used such as the Champange Bottle and Celing Mirror, the Nasils in the Car and the Bus hitting that poor fellow. The film ended amazingly as Glen appeared to burst out of Tiffany's womb, leaving a good idea for a sequel. That is until Seed came along.

These  90's sequels tend to try out something pretty different from its predecessors, to the point of even negating parts of the series.  Such films include Jason Goes to Hell The Final Friday, New Nightmare, and H2O, of which the former two managed to instill new energy back into their respective series again. In this case, Bride of Chucky is going all-out for laughs, and it's quite successful at doing so, making it easily the best film in this not-so-good series.The movie's first scenes already let us know just how tongue-in-cheek all of this is.  A cop enters an evidence room, which includes such items as Michael Myers' and Jason Voorhees' masks, Freddy Krueger's glove, and Leatherface's chainsaw.  The cop picks up one specific object we can't see, though it's obvious it's Chucky, the serial-killer possessed doll. Eventually, the doll gets to the hands of Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly), who actually turns out to be the killer's (when he was a human)  former girlfriend.  Using the help of a voodoo book, she revives Chucky, and ends up imprisoning him because she's still angry at him for never marrying her. Chucky escapes, kills Tiffany, and puts her soul into another doll. Naturally, she freaks out when she sees what's happened to her, but Chucky informs her they can still be human again. The only way for them to do that is to use the amulet that was on the human Chucky's body when he died. Thus, they have to get to that specific cemetary in Hackensack, New Jersey, so they enlist the aid of Jessie (Nick Stabile) and Jade (Katherine Heigl) via phone to deliver some dolls with the promise of big cash.  The two young lovers agree and decide to get hitched.  All seems well for the two, until murders start popping up around them and they begin to suspect each other, all the meantime never noticing that the dolls are the real culprits. Bride of Chucky is, simply put, a dark comedy that only has the concern of making its viewers laugh.  And boy, some of these jokes are absolutely hilarious.  My favorite part is probably the scene where Chucky is crawling back to his van when some stoned pothead sees him.  Chucky proceeds to give him the finger, resulting in the pothead's hilarious deadpan response, Rude f***ing doll!  Another one of my favorite lines must be when Jessie asks Chucky how he got to be this way, and he responds by saying, It's a long story.  In fact, if they made a movie, it'd take 3 or 4 sequels to do it justice.  If that doesn't get you laughing, then I wouldn't recommend this movie to you. But for all those who enjoy tongue-in-cheek horror, this is a treat.  The scene-stealers are Chucky and Tiffany, spouting a lot of memorable lines without ever getting into the hip style that has annoyingly permeated virtually every other slasher film in recent memory.  Brad Dourif, of course, voices Chucky and he hasn't lost that same sense of fun over the years the series was in hiatus.  Jennifer Tilly is equally as fun as Tiffany, making for an effective foil to Chucky, and is all the more hilarious because of their love/hate relationship that's positively psychotic. The special effects are among the movie's highlights; the dolls look mostly flawlessly rendered and amazingly lifelike.  But how could any review of Bride of Chucky go by without mentioning the doll sex scene.  It's probably the reason it got half the money it did at the box office.  Let me just say this, you probably won't believe it, but this sex scene is the most tasteful part of the entire movie!  That should give you some idea of what to expect from the rest of the film. The movie's also got the requisite blood and gore, with particularly memorable death scenes.  Despite all the violence, this isn't a movie for die-hard horror fans looking for a scary or suspenseful gorefest.  The movie doesn't actually kick into thrill ride mode until the last 10 minutes in the cemetary.  Even then, you have to ask yourself just how exciting it is to see dolls and humans duking it out. Now, even as an intentionally goofy horror/comedy, the movie still has some big flaws.  There are no rooting interests at all.  The dolls, while obviously funny, are pretty damn crazy.  As for the humans, they're either annoying or simply display nothing approaching charisma or good acting. The movie also takes too long to get going, and considering the movie's only 89 minutes, that's certainly a problem. It's not until the half-hour or so mark that Chucky comes to life again and the road trip to Hackensack doesn't begin until the movie's a little over halfway through.  This is a flaw that's made forgivable because once the movie gets going, the pace is unflagging. I enjoyed Ronny Yu's high-energy direction, which is an approach that closely follows all the other most recent slasher sequels (it actually only worked well in Jason Goes to Hell, but New Nightmare was decent in this respect).  After the pedestrian work of the other installments, it's nice to see some sturdy direction.  This film's final scenes sets itself up for another sequel, and considering it's box office success, I don't see any reason why it won't happen.  Bride of Chucky is goofy and certainly lacking in intelligence, but it's got a hell of a lot of entertainment value, and that's all you could really ask for out of it.

But this is a really good movie if you're willing to except two things.. that this is a dark comedy not a horror film per say and that some of the major continuity from the previous films are disregarded. So if you're willing to except those two things, you can enjoy this film. Let's start with the story, Don Mancini wrote the story for all three films and wanted to reinvent the franchise, so while this film takes place where the last one left off and this film acknowledges the events of the last three. It also disregards certain things for the plot of this one. If anything this film is more of a sequel to the first film then the third one. This film is made on the 10th anniversary of the original horror classic Child's Play where a Chicago serial killer named Charles Lee Ray aka Lakesore Strangaler is gunned down by the police in a toy store and he uses a voodoo spell to transfer his wicked soul into a toy doll. Now ten years later Ray's old girlfriend and possible serial killing accomplice, Tiffany steals his doll parts from a police station and uses the same voodoo spell to resurrect Ray's soul in the doll. But in anger Chucky kills Tiffany and puts her soul into a doll. The two then go on a Mickey & Mallory like road trip to possess some human bodies. Now as a hardcore fan I have to point out how some things fit with the other films. Through out the series there always been inconstancy's with the voodoo spell, the words are the same but depending on the plot the spell can be very long or very short, the same here. The major plot for the first three films is that Chucky could only transfer his soul into the body of the first person who found out he was alive in the doll, which happens to be six years old Andy Barcley and if he didn't do so in a few days his soul would be trapped forever in the doll and in the process he would become more human on the inside of the doll, developing organs and what not. All of this is disregarded in this film. Here Chucky says he and Tiffany have to go to Hackensack New Jearsy to get an amulet called the heart of Dambella(the voodoo god) that was buried with Chucky's body as he wore it as a neck-less the night he was killed, this has nothing to do with the plots of the first three and not logical if you go by the first three but it would be very hard to continue that story with the introduction of Tiffany, also there's no worry from Chucky about having only a few days to find a body to transfer his soul into before it becomes trapped in the doll, so Mancini decided just keep the broad sense of the story arch of a good guy doll possessed by a voodoo worshiping killer. Another major difference is the change in tone, this film is very much a comedy with characters almost breaking the fourth wall and parodying the slasher genre much like the movie Scream did around this time and in the process Chucky's personality changes a bit. He's more mellow here, the first three portrayed him as a innocent looking toy doll with the mind of a foul mouth killer with a bad temper and the murders were shocking but here the murders are done with dark gallows humor. Neverless the film does a great job with what they wanted to do, a lot of the humor here was funny and to be honest even in the first three Chucky showed some dark humor. Ronny Yu did a great job with directing, the visual look, pace and camera shots were great. The best part of the movie is the opening, revealing Tiffany retrieving the Chucky doll and Rob Zombie's Living dead girl song playing in the opening credits. Don Mancini did a great job with creating the twisted relationship between Chucky's and Tiffany. Tiffany is in love/obsessed with Chucky while he likes her but doesn't need her in his life. The plot unfolds nicely you don't really know where it's going to go and the protagonists Jesse and Jade works well as a contrast to the evil Chucky & Tiffany. But the real stars are the sexy Jennifer Tilly as Tiffany and Brad Dourif returning for the fourth time as Chucky. The two have great chemistry together. Tilly was the perfect fit to be Chucky's bride and she looks really sexy especially when she wears that tight leather outfit in the opening. Dourif has perfected his Chucky laugh here it really sounds psychotic. John Ritter is fun as a jerky cop and Jade's dad. The film pays homage to Freddy Kruger and other slasher icons, Mickey& Mallory and The bride of Frankenstein. So while some including me would like to see a less comedic Chucky, and despite plot holes this is a great film for what it is, a horror comedy.

I can't express how glad I am that I was wrong.Bride Of Chucky re-imagines the killer doll saga as a pure black comedy, and the outcome of this metamorphosis makes it really easy to forgive the sins of the previous two films. While the entire series up to this point was liberally sprinkled with attempts at integrating humor into the horror, the sophomoric, cheeseball approach of the antics only served to undermine any potential for Child's Play 2 and 3 to match the deft balance struck by the potent original. Bride Of Chucky has no such pretensions, and the film doesn't even bother to suggest you should take it seriously. Instead, the emphasis here is solely on demented splat-stick, and the result is a truly witty and twisted gem.It's probably not all that important for our purposes here to delve into how Chucky's improbable resurrection comes to pass, and if you're the type to question the plausibility of a serial killer's former girlfriend tracking down the doll his soul was transferred into, reconstructing his dismembered frame, and performing a voodoo ceremony over the rubber carcass to successfully bring him back from the dead, it's a safe bet that you're not in the demographic for Bride Of Chucky. All the rest of us need to know is that Chucky does indeed return from the netherworld to stalk and slash once more, and this time out he gains a co-conspirator when he repeats the ceremony and channels Jennifer Tilly's essence into a companion doll who turns out to be a leather-clad, gothed out femme fatale with a serious mean streak. The film follows the pair as they embark on a road trip with an unsuspecting young couple to reclaim a mystical medallion that will allow them to permanently return to human form, leaving a trail of hijinks and bodies in their wake. Again, if any of this sounds ridiculous to you... Okay, well, it probably is, but Bride Of Chucky wears its camp elements like badges of honor, and going along on this ride proves to be an immensely entertaining experience.Well aware of its target audience, the film is loaded with in-jokes for horror fans, and just a cursory scan of the police evidence inventory during the prologue handily sets the tone for the extended knowing wink sustained throughout the film. On that note, Bride is also chock full of gore, something sorely lacking in the rest of the series, and even though most of the increasingly creative killings are played for laughs, the humor doesn't dilute the potency of stellar gruesome gags like the nails to the face bit or the fate that befalls an amorous couple who make the mistake of canoodling on a water bed with a mirror mounted on the ceiling above it.The casting is equally inspired, and Jennifer Tilly proves to be the absolute perfect choice to accompany Chucky on this journey. Her sparring with Brad Dourif is priceless more often than not, and their farcical domestic interplay provides the film with some of its wittiest moments. The presence of John Ritter is likewise a huge boon, and the late great funnyman shines here as always despite the brevity of his involvement in the proceedings.I'm sort of bummed that I didn't see this until after Seed Of Chucky had already been released, because the cliff-hanger denouement doesn't have quite as much of a punch when you know what's coming next. But even if you are aware of what's in store, the finale provides a fitting segue into the next installment and ends the film on a definite absurdist high note.If the notion of two homicidal, foul-mouthed dolls embarking on an interstate killing spree and having frenzied, plastic-bumping nookie doesn't sound appealing to you, then these clearly aren't the droids you're looking for. But if you have a skewed sense of humor and can spare 90 minutes to check your analytical mind at the door and giggle like a stoned hyena, then you'll have a hell of a good time embarking on Chucky and Tiffany's trek. I know I did.

The film and it's sequel, both banned for being encouraging to children to kill, were good films. It was this forth of the series ten years later that would really make the series however. Whilst never scary, Bride of Chucky was superb in that it was a wonderful mix of comedy and horror with an extra large chunk of gore.Set a while after the third film, Bride of Chucky focuses primarily on the relationship between Chucky (Brad Dourif) and his girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly). Convinced that Chucky planned to propose, Tiffany resurrects him, only for him to then deny her belief and to kill her. Bringing her back in a doll of her own, Chucky then works with his girlfriend to possess an amulet which will allow them to take the bodies of young lovers Jesse (Nick Stabile) and Jade (Katherine Heigl).The brilliance of Bride of Chucky is that it never takes itself seriously. Like so many other horror films in recent years, this film is devoted to the idea that deaths should be as gruesome, inventive and frequent as possible. Irrelevant of whether the plot is decent (a rare plus side for the Child's Play series), the essence of this film is simply to kill off countless members of the cast in extreme, sudden (if possible) ways.Acting wise, before becoming the doll, Tilly is superb as human Tiffany, in love with Chucky and feeling trapped dating the irritating Damien Baylock (Alexis Arquette). The acting though, Tilly included, feels slightly irrelevant when Chucky is around.All in all, there's relatively little which can be said about a film like this. With acting an irrelevancy (the only characters of any importance being puppets) and a script which is better than expected, the only real thing to focus in on is the gore and the horror. Whilst not in the slightest amount scary, Bride of Chucky does satisfy on the other count. This film features some superb moments of violence and some equally wonderful lines (a brief tribute to Pinhead from Hellraiser being one of many) and ultimately it's just good fun. It's the ultimate film to watch on a Friday night. Simple, easy going, fun.

The humor in this sequel is brilliant and works perfect for a movie with a doubtful premise. The title BRIDE OF CHUCKY may sound very cheesy for non fans of the genre but it's a great title for the movie (parody of Bride of Frankenstein in many aspects). In 1998 the horror genre was on a decline mainly because of many attempts to copy the style that Scream copied from the 80's slashers. Ronny Yu and Don Mancini created a great horror comedy that has nothing to do with the previous Child's PLay movies. The stylish direction and entertaining script are the best features of the movie. There's plenty of great gore! and great deaths. The Pinhead reference was hilarious. Also, the motel death scene was brilliant. The humor is great as I said, there are plenty of references to other horror movies that only fans of the genre could understand. The dolls sex scene may freak you out but it's damn funny. The acting is pretty good this time. You can't go wrong with Jennifer Tilly (she's extremely hot!) and Brad Dourif. Katherine Heigl also delivers a good performance and her beautiness helps a lot. The score is perfect for the movie (specially Rob Zombie's contributions). Chucky rocks again!BRIDE OF CHUCKY isn't an easy watch for non fans of the genre, specially for the in-jokes and black humor. In the other hand, this movie is a delight for fans of the genre and of course, of the Chucky movies. Watch it with low expectations and don't be influenced by it's title because BRIDE OF CHUCKY is a great horror comedy. One of the bests from the 90's, seriously.

Bride Of Chucky is the best of all the Chucky films because it does not focus on scares and violence, rather it focuses on the more important elements. Instead of having scene after scene filled with violence, the director combined all the elements of action, drama, suspense, horror, and even comedy into Bride Of Chucky. The only actor to act in all four films returns; Brad Dourif reprises his role as the voice of Chucky. Jennifer Tilly lends her voice to the Bride Of Chucky as Chucky's bride, Tiffany. Chucky and Tiffany fit together very well for a pair bent on creating malice, chaos, havoc and mayhem.Though Chucky and Tiffany are definitely the main focal point of this movie, but they can't make it a successful film by themselves. Strong performances by relative newcomers Nick Stabile, Katherine Heigl and seasoned veteran John Ritter made this a tremendous hit. Katherine Heigl may be known for her portrayal of Steven Seagal's niece in Under Siege 2 Dark Territory plays Jade. Nick Stabile is Jesse, Jade's boyfriend. John Ritter plays a police chief and who hates Jade's boyfriend, Jesse. I commend the creator and the puppeteers of the Chucky and Tiffany dolls for their original and unique movements.

I have been a big fan of the Child's Play franchise since I was about seven years old, and this movie pretty much sums up everything that makes a Chucky movie great. In this fourth installment, the focus is finally taken off of the saga of Andy Barclay (which was getting a bit played out by the end of Child's Play 3), and instead on Chucky and Tiffany, a previous flame who was with him up until his original death. After Tiffany (played to perfection by the wonderful Jennifer Tilly and her wonderful cleavage) finally gets a hold of Chucky's remains (basically a trash bag full of Chucky parts see part 3) and resurrects him with some strategic sewing, he turns on her and ends up passing her soul into another doll. Together, they hitch a ride with runaway couple Jesse and Jade (Nick Stabile and Katherine Heigl) to New Jersey to find a stone that Chucky was wearing around his neck the day he died that will help resurrect them to human form. As you can predict, lots of hectic things happen on this road trip. Blood is spilled, pot is smoked and Chucky does indeed get lucky (in a hilarious and memorable scene that will be burned in your memory forever). Don Mancini, the creator of Chucky, writer of all three previous installments, returns as writer and fleshes out a beautifully demented and imaginative horror comedy. With the flare of director Ronny Yu (who would later go on to direct Freddy Vs. Jason), Bride Of Chucky is the best installment in the Chucky series thus far. Everything about this movie works. The death scenes are elaborate and somewhat comedic in parts, the music rocks (check out the soundtrack), and the story is so much fun, you just can't turn away in the 90 minutes this movie spans.

Sure, it still has gore; but as far as I'm concerned, you CAN have a comedy that's gory. Maybe that's a worrying indication of exactly WHAT makes me laugh. Not to worry, though because nary a titter was to be raised from me whilst watching Bride of Chucky. It's more one long giant in-joke than a film, and the joke sucks. Did we really need the series to get any sillier than it already was? I don't think so. It's honestly as if the makers got bored of doing horror and decided that they wanted to make an X rated episode of The Simpsons instead, only without ANY of the originality...A pal and I had rented this to veg out in front of with a few beers. In those circumstances, you WANT to like a film; but try as I might, I couldn't and still can't muster up any good feeling toward this.So it's a parody of sorts. Isn't a walking, talking and killing cherubic doll parody enough? Obviously not. The people behind this can't even stick to lampooning their own created universe, they've got to impinge on ones imagined by others as well. The snide reference to Freddy/Michael/Jason et al at the beginning only serves to illustrate how out of its league this film is. Comparing this film to any of them (Even Friday the Thirteenth Part 26 Jason Buys a Golfing Umbrella to Protect Him from a Shower of Nubile Teen Blood - coming to a cinema near you soon kids!) in a favourable light is surely asking to be laughed out onto the streets.The kids in the movie are just 'cool'. They can't be bothered to be witty (Musn't be seen to upstage the plastic props, must we?) As far as I can remember, not one of them displays a smidgen of talent between them. Don't fret, however, this even extends to the adults too. It's almost as bad as the lead character in part 3 (Justin, was he called?) But not quite.Thus, we are left to rely on the 'mutant Ken and Barbie' for our yucks. To be fair, it is neither the fault of Dourif or Tilly that things are this bad, but there is only so much they can do in such a haphazard production. Tilly even acquits herself quite well, enough to suggest that she is right for the part, and that the concept itself may have worked better in different hands. She deserved (and got) another shot at the role. Unfortunately, this necessitates a sequel. If it's as bad as this one, it may just be the last film I ever watch. Suicide being more preferable. It MUST be cackhanded treatment of the possible material by Yu and the writers; because as I said, Tilly is great. There is even ONE good moment (count it!) By the time we reach the ending though - 'Tiffany' the doll' going through the agonies of childbirth - I'd had about all I could take of such abject stupidness and blatant non-acting by most of the cast, doll pair excepted.The Childs Play series was tootling along fine until the needless aberrations that were parts 3 & 4. On the evidence of the latter, it can only get worse. Leave it alone now, eh? I would've said different, had this one actually been any good; but it wasn't, not by a long chalk. ... and don't even get me started on the dolls having sex...(EDIT On 28th of June 2006 I got to see Seed of Chucky... As expected, it makes the same mis-steps as its predecessor. There is no reason to recommend it if you find yourself agreeing with my dislike of this, because its problems are only exaggerated to worse effect. The distinguishing feature between the two is that what passes for 'satire' isn't even consistent anymore after the six-year wait... I took a raincheck on the idea of offing myself, but neither foray into the realm of send-ups is worth the time, by my estimation.)

Had I been 20 years younger, I would have probably loved it. As an adult Horror enthusiast, each and every Chucky film up till now have been a remarkably unrewarding experience.While attempting to infiltrate the pantheon of slashers (and failing miserably), Chucky has made sure to let everyone know that logic is never a necessity. Freddie and Jason only get banished/defeated, so their return for each of the sequels is at least remotely comprehensible (which is all that's necessary considering mostly everything else about the slasher-monsters' supernatural strength and potency). Chucky, on the other hand, is constantly resurrected. How? How come? Who cares, Chucky's back and he's hilarious! Ha ha ha, right? Just what we want in a Horror film, to be half-entertained by a third rate comedian without a moment of actual fear.The good news is that the fourth sequel recognizes Chucky for what he is - a joke. That's why several scenes present a comic breaking of the 4th wall and some well deserved homages to those who actually succeeded where Chucky would forever fail (like Mike Mayers, Jason Voorhees and Hellraiser). In order to complete the comic effect, Chucky is this time accompanied by a female counterpart, the wonderful Jennifer Tilly as Tiffany, Chucky's Bride. Their interactions and dynamics are quite hilarious.Adjectives such as comic and hilarious have absolutely no place in a Horror film. True, Freddie has always been the ultimate morbid comedian, but the story-line and plot have been eerie and at times terrifying (words that in no manner can be used to describe anything about any of the Chucky films so far). Just like the first 3 films, Bride of Chucky is good for a few laughs with your friends on Halloween, or maybe even as a drinking game. However, as a Horror film? Another moderately entertaining let down.

Possessed doll Chucky finally lands a bride who happens to be a witch. Viewers are subject to an assault of perversion including a love scene between both dolls. We witness the birth of baby Chucky, as if the sex scene wasn't enough. Directed by Ronny Yu with fine production effects. This is at least an improvement over his last effort, Warriors of Virtue. Jennifer Tilly is ideal for the role of Tiffany who uses voodoo to resurrect Chucky. Their warped relationship bares reference to Bonnie and Clyde and Natural Born Killers until betrayal and carnage set in. They hitchhike with an eloping couple who are blamed for a murder spree. Nick Stabile and Katherine Heigl play the couple who are on the run but get caught up in a string of murders they didn't commit. John Ritter appears as Heigl's tyrant uncle and the role is something different for him but more would have been great as oppose to a murder that occurs way too early. Brad Dourif provides the snarl of Chucky. Pointless puke fest where viewers cheered when a truck mashes some poor dote into the pavement. The honeymoon murders are also unnecessary. This is one wedding celebration that gushes in its own explicit mess.

With a tongue firmly in cheek, BRIDE OF CHUCKY is definitely more comedy than horror. As a horror film, it's a total failure, with a string of gory murders having little impact on the viewer. It could be viewed as a shining example of all that's wrong with the genre at the moment - a lack of the real understanding of horror. As a comedy, though, there are plenty of laughs to be had from the two bickering dolls and the amusing storyline which recalls NATURAL BORN KILLERS. Another plus is that it's an improvement on the previous sequels in the series - but then what couldn't be? Besides, how can you not laugh at a film where two dolls share a very intimate scene?The violence here is played for laughs and there's a lot of it. The puppet animation is rather good too, coming from old hand Kevin Yagher. Coming after SCREAM, there are lots of references to horror films, as you would expect. The obvious influence here, though, is THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, seen playing on television at one point.Brad Dourif returns as the voice of the foul-mouthed doll, Chucky. However it's Jennifer Tilly who provides the most laughs as his bad-tempered and psychotic companion, Tiffany, both in human and doll form. Other characters come and go (usually in bloody ways) and make little impact, apart from the leads playing the teenage couple - the usual flawless and talentless young actors. Apart from this, the plot is contrived and hopeless, and far too simplistic. The film works best when focusing on the love/hate banter between Chucky and Tiffany. It's worth a few laughs, but viewers looking for serious horror should go elsewhere as this is just the latest in a long line of recent lame-brain good-to-look-at glossy films catering for the mainstream crowd.

"},{"Title":"An interesting way to start a new trilogy","Date":"31 August 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Although he was late in the decade, the foul-mouthed serial killer Charles Lee Ray who transferred his soul into a Good Guy Doll still made a name for himself as a famous horror icon. After transferring his soul into the doll, Chucky (as he would later be addressed) gained quite a following for his disruptive antics and morbid enthusiasm. Upon his first appearance, Chucky had an imposing presence that made several viewers uncomfortable because of how creepy dolls are in general. However similar to other franchises, the scare factor and level of seriousness viewers began to accept was beginning to stretch too thin. By the time Child's Play 3 (1991) came out, fans and viewers a like became fed up with Chucky's goal of trying to transfer his soul into the body of Andy Barclay. For writer and creator Don Mancini, a small hiatus was in order after being pushed around to make sequel after sequel for his brainchild. A decade after the release of the original Child's Play (1988), Mancini returned and wrote for this feature that began Chucky's new trilogy.To some this was an improvement over Child's Play 3 (1991), while others were shocked the see the abrupt change. What Mancini had changed was the tone of the script. For the last three films Mancini wrote them as if they were literal; happening in the real world. The new intonation was that the story would be self aware in its execution but still continue from where the last film ended (roughly). An old lover of Charles named Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) acquires the shredded remains of Chucky (Brad Dourif) and resurrects him. After being brought back, Chucky decides in order to finally get out of his body, he needs the amulet he had from the time of Child's Play (1988) located in his casket where he was buried. Paralleling these events is troubled couple Jade (Katherine Heigl) and Jesse (Nick Stabile) who are constantly harassed by Jade's uncle Chief Warren Kincaid (John Ritter) for Jesse supposedly being a bad influence.As much as some viewers find the self-aware script jarringly different, having the series turn a comedic cheek to that of serious was a good move. Considering it became sillier as time went on, parodying it seems like an okay solution even with its flaws. For example the fact that it pays homage to its own films by clearly making a comment about it is funny for the fans to see. Even better, it references other horror icons directly and indirectly. It does bring up some clerical issues though. For example, other than Chucky how would another character know how Chucky killed people in the prior films? Also, is this now a universe where all the horror icons have been locked up or killed that their item that made them popular is now in storage? It doesn't make sense even if it is funny to see on screen. As for physical comedy, there are some ironic moments in the film involving Chucky's plastic body. Yet again, some bits are silly because of how physically impossible it works out.One other component to the writing that may make the plot feel predictable is because of how familiar viewers are with Chucky's nature. If you know how Chucky works, well then things may be more transparent than expected. The acting is adequate for what is asked though. Brad Dourif again succeeds at voicing his plastic counterpart with just the right amount of comedic and quotable lines. Jennifer Tilly as Tiffany matches Dourif's chemistry nicely by being just as foul-mouthed and violent. Nick Stabile and Katherine Heigl as the troubled couple feel authentic and end up demonstrating the power of teamwork later on. John Ritter as the annoying uncle plays his part like it should be too. There's even an appearance of Lawrence Dane from Darkman II The Return of Durant (1995) playing a detective. Since this is a comedy now, there is no scare factor unless the viewer doesn't like stitched up Chucky. The violence though is just as bloody as were compared to its other sequels. The kill scenes just keep getting more and more inventive by the jigsaw doll.The cinematography shot by Peter Pau was decent too. Pau as director of photography has had more experience in the action genre and his skills are highlighted when the few action scenes in this feature show up. For every other frame, the scenes are well lit and conceal the illusion of the living dolls. Also an important side note; as time has gone on, Kevin Yagher's production of puppet effects designers / puppeteer coordinators has really gotten the knack for lifelike movement. The original Chucky was pretty convincing but now it looks great and perfected. The film score by returning composer Graeme Revell was unique. For this entry, Revell creates a new theme for Chucky and keeps some old ones from his score of Child's Play 2 (1990). He also has a theme for Chucky and Tiffany, which consists of solo guitar and chanting girl choir. The rest of his score has a mix of the classic horror cues and action related arpeggios. The soundtrack containing songs sung by Rob Zombie and others is an okay addition but not necessary per say. It does make it feel quite 90s.It still has its problems of unexplained loopholes, ridiculous concepts involving physical comedy and continuity errors but it's a nice self- twist. The self-aware referencing script, the violence, the musical score and acting help make it watchable fluff. "},{"Title":"Mischievous duo","Date":"6 June 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" With the boring entry when it came to the 3rd installment that Don Mancini didn't want to do because of the lack of ideas. This is a refreshing start to another level. Although this is not a serious suspenseful horror like the first one it's still a fresh entry that does have entertainment value. Especially with the Marilyn Mason massacre scene I could tell this is going to be a different style of entry. Actually the beginning scene where you shows Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger items. This is a balls to the wall kinda entry to this franchise (although the doll sex scene is uncomfortable to watch even if it's off-screen. It sort of reminded me of Team America World Police). Which doesn't make any sense since Chucky doesn't have a penis, well at least when shown down their in the second installment. The plot keeps contradicting the rules of the previous movies in this franchise to bring Chucky back and the direction to go with it. Yes, I am talking about the revival of Chucky and the amulet/medallion thing (well they always have to think of creative ways to bring Chucky back). This time Chucky has a more sinister look with scars, stitches and all. While the previous movies dealt with the chemistry with Andy, this one deals with Chucky's chemistry with a seductive and psychotic woman named Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly). Jennifer Tilly is just fine and reminded me of a real life Harley Quinn. The chemistry between the two is far from a normal generic relationship, kinda reminded me of Bonnie and Clyde on adrenaline. Sure some horror franchises with a iconic goes in a very silly direction after the 3rd or 4th installment this one actually does work. Also Chucky's mischivious, foul mouth and evil bad boy persona with a mean attitude goes up another notch with this one. Even the kills this time is in another creative level and includes memorable segments to go with the whole package. Even the ending brings something new instead of sticking with the previous Child's Play formula. Watching this was like watching a cool horror slasher comedic road trip movie.7.8/10 "},{"Title":"Chucky's Chimeric Chuckles","Date":"9 February 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Normally by the time a franchise has reached the fourth instalment most people involved from the (paid) scriptwriters through to the (paying) public are beginning to lose heart. This is an excellent exception to that rule.The premise of the film is that the soul of the late Charles Lee Ray is trapped inside Chucky the doll. Charles' former girlfriend Tiffany plans to retrieve the doll and by use of magic, bring it back to life. If only life (and death in this case) could be so simple! Once revived, Chucky would much rather occupy Mr Ray's body, which was buried with the amulet required to complete this transformation. By this time of course, due to the treacherous machinations of both Tiffany and Chucky, they are now both dolls. What follows is a road movie as the pair kill time and people whilst implicating two naïve star-struck lovers Jesse and Jade who finally piece together what is happening.From the opening scene as corrupt cop Bailey makes his way through an evidence room to the Grand Guignol finale played out in a graveyard there are nods to various kindred films and characters from Michael Myers to The Exorcist, from Friday the 13th to Pinhead, throwing in clips from 'Bride of Frankenstein' and 'Murder, She Wrote' and an hilarious reference to Martha Stewart.The entertainment value comes largely from the relationship between two deadly dolls, their snappy one-liners, love-hate relationship and competitiveness in murderous invention.Director Ronny Yu and writer Don Mancini keep both action and dialogue pacey and ensure an excellent balance of comic moments and sanguinary shocks. At an hour and a half good editing ensures no outstaying of welcome and the accompanying music tracks from Rob Zombie, Slayer, et al is suitably heavy. Special and visual effects are extremely well done and almost seamless. Of the acting, most of the cast do what is necessary despite being upstaged by the deadly dolls. Special mention should go to Jennifer Tilly for her dangerously beguiling femme fatale.Interestingly, with only minimal references to previous films in this series, it is quite possible to treat this as a stand-alone item and derive just as much entertainment value from it.

She retrieves the Chucky doll, and revives him back to life. Chucky's amulet is required to transfer his soul into another body. Tiffany & Chucky use Jade (Katharine Heigl) & Jesse (Nick Stable) as pawns to get them to Chucky's resting place. Jade & Jessie get framed for murder, because nobody knows Chucky & Tiffany are on a murdering spree. This passes the time decently enough, and it has flashes of brilliance, but it lacks that special something that made Seed of Chucky so entertaining. It starts off with a bang. We get nods at infamous horror franchises, and Rob Zombie's Living Dead Girl. One thing I'll say is that this movie is filled with amusing inside jokes; even Christian Slater isn't safe from exemption. There are also references about how dated Chucky is, and his struggle to adapt. It also goes the full comedic route. Chucky gets stoned, fires off the one- liners and is now a comedian. He was firmly into Freddy Krueger territory when it comes to one-liners. The gore will have gore hounds pleased. We get John Ritter with a bunch of pins stuck in his face, slit throats, stabbings. A doll is burned alive in a nasty way, a gory birth. Somebody gets drilled with a truck, gunshot wounds, and more. My personal favorite is a death involving glass shards and a water bed. I won't spoil it, but man is it messy. My main problem with this movie is that the characters of Jade & Jesse aren't interesting enough. The characters of Chucky & Tiffany are the glue that holds this movie together, and despite how enjoyable they are, it's not really enough. Katharine Heigl had yet to achieve stardom at this juncture, and it shows. She has the innocent thing down pat, but she's rather bland to watch, and doesn't have much character to speak of. Nick Stable is even worse. He's one of those wooden hunks that can't act all that well. Women will probably adore him, though. I didn't believe they were in love for one minute, despite that I was supposed to. Gordon Michael Woolvett looks like Aaron Carter. I actually dug his gay shtick. John Ritter is amusing as the chief of police. He played a great jerk. Brad Douriff is always reliable as Chucky, while Jennifer Tilly's provocative and sexy show had me grinning from ear to ear. Alexis Arquette annoyed the crap out of me as the Gothic dude. Final Thoughts It's fairly enjoyable, don't get me wrong. But I think Seed of Chucky pulled it off much better.

Film snobs and critics just won't get it, the only way to actually enjoy this film is to watch it expecting the ridiculous and to absolutely NOT take it seriously in the slightest. I did that and guess what? I loved it! Bride of Chucky is a title, blatantly spoofing that other hilarious film, Bride of Frankenstein only here, Chucky's bride appears in it for basically the whole film. The Child's Play series are films not to be taken seriously with and so Ronny Yu runs with the idea and decides to take it to the limits of daftness and successfully creates a really funny guilty pleasure. Whoever said they didn't even giggle slightly at the sight of two dolls having sex has got to be the embodiment of Pinoccio.The film starts like a completely fresh new start, if you haven't seen the other Child's Play films then you could actually just watch this one and you wouldn't know any different. The idea of Chucky getting into the little boys body (who isn't so little now anyway) has obviously been scrapped and a new plot of Chucky on the quest to getting some amulet has been added like The Little Vampire. Do we care about this blatant plot shift? No. Well I didn't anyway, die hard fans might be a bit brassed off, but I just enjoy the series and I don't necessarily think they're my favourite films ever! So the basic formula of Chucky is there only this time he has a girlfriend who has an uncanny resemblance to Patsy off my favourite comedy series Absolutely Fabulous. Even though they're meant to be the villains, you can't help but love them for their utter mischievousness towards the poor teenage couple. We as an audience egg them on to kill off any randomer!Although I did thoroughly enjoy Bride of Chucky I do feel that it didn't earn its 18 certificate. It could've afforded to be much bloodier, especially as the kills are so creative (thanks to Tiffany!)The screenplay is crazier than ever, the directing fills the film with the life it deserves and the puppets are really well made I could just imagine the puppeteers during the sex scene thinking, what s**t are we making here? But they really did look terrific and resembled a bit less of a midget in a costume, although obviously it was at times, it merely added to the complete nonsense filled fun the film possesses. This film just goes to show that not every film has to be all serious, sometimes its good to be as daft as you can be, just to lighten up a sometimes dull world.

I do think that Tiffany was right for chucky because they were both killers and studied voodoo magic in different ways and that Tiffany would kill people similar to the way that chucky kills people(tiffany slits throat of police officer+ chucky(second film)had tied a woman to a chair and slit her throat) and they think in different ways and they are both similar to one another. I suggest to any young couple to not watch this unless you both agree to do the same thing. If I had offended anyone let me know, if I did , Sorry!

I do like them all (I haven't seen Child's Play 3, though) and they are all pretty scary. Seed of Chucky wasn't really scary, but that's besides the point.If you don't know the summary, Tiffany, Chucky's former girlfriend and accomplice bribes a police officer to get the remands of Chucky from his injuries / death in Child's Play 3. She stitches him up using new doll parts, and then brings him to life. After she is heartbroken by the killer doll, she shuns and teases him so he kills Tiffany. He transfers her soul into a doll, and they then settle on transferring both of their souls into a teenage couple. Tiffany secretly pays the male in the couple to drive the dolls to New Jersey, so they can get the Heart of Damballa. With this, they can transfer their souls into Jesse and Jade, the couple. They, of course, leave a spree of murder and mayhem behind them, pointing evidence to Jesse and Jade.Now onto the review. I totally thought the movie was a great horror and thriller film, but it was a bit sad for me. Yes, I know. It's dark comedy. And some of the scenes were a bit too gory for me. The two prime examples the couple in The Honeymoon Sweets (hehe, pun) Motel. Tiffany throws a bottle of champagne onto an overlooking mirror, and it shatters and falls onto the water bed as the couple is making out / foreplay and the water and blood goes EVERYWHERE. The bodies are later shown. Also, David's death. He is startled by the appearance of Chucky and Tiffany and then backs up into an interstate road, gets hit by a truck, and chunks fly all over the place. I almost threw up. Anyways, I know that Chucky is an evil b*****d, but the weed-smoking and cynical jokes were kind of annoying. And the end was pretty freaking creepy. When Tiffany briefly comes back to life and gives birth, that was a big holy crap. With the blood going onto the detective's face... Ew...Anyways, I really enjoyed the movie as part of the horror genre, giving it an 8.3 / 10, which equals to a B. I DO NOT recommend this to ANYONE who is easily scared with blood and / or gore. I watched Scream, and I wasn't really scared. And I'm a 13 year-old male. But I think that this was more disturbing because of the fact being that they are homicidal dolls.

So he does, in the role of Jennifer Tilly, who thoroughly rejuvenated this series as Jeri Ryan did for 'Star Trek Voyager.' Tilly didn't just create a presence; she added much needed humor, back-story, drama, tension and a great little sidekick/play-thing for Chucky. And as much as I liked her in the feature, she can't get all the credit the props (watch the first 1-2 minutes for horror-homages), the writing, the inside jokes (again, the opening + Pinhead) and Chucky lines were great (In fact, if (this) were a movie, it would take 3-4 sequels just to do it justice, among others.) Mercifully, Chucky and the series has given up on Andy the Hide the Soul quest, and just settled for a new way out of his body. He teams up with his ex (Tilly) whom he transfers into a Bride doll and a couple of Bonnie & Clyde teens (Really, Heigl?) to regain this pendant buried with Chucky's human corpse. This is for any Chucky fan, 1980s slasher-horror fans or even to those who's never seen any of the previous 'Child's Play' films. It's funny, dark, harmless, gory &#x96; but not over the top and despite Tilly's literal 20 minutes of screen time, it's always great to see her. After all, you barely see her play poker anymore.

The film had run out of control. I personally feel that the writer, Don Mancini, knew that he couldn't top the second film in terms of being scary and horrific. The third film, despite being entertained, was pretty stale. The second film was a really over-the-top gorefest of a freakshow horror film. The first film was a decent, but pretty flawed, horror film. Now we have BRIDE OF CHUCKY which is more humor oriented, which is what I thought they should have done in the first place due to how funny the visual idea of a doll attacking people is to me. So, does BRIDE OF CHUCKY work? Well, you already read my summary.The plot may not sound much like a Chucky film. A teenage couple are on the run and are accused of murder. What they don't realize is that the two dolls in the back of their car are slaughtering people wherever they go. It turns out that Chucky has a girlfriend named Tiffany. She brings him back from the dead using voodoo. She locks him in a cage. He escapes from the cage. He kills her and then he turns her into a doll!!! Yeah, you probably realize by now that this film really isn't to be taken seriously in the slightest. This isn't like the other three films that try to be scary. While this does have some creepy moments for sure, the film aims more for comedy, action, and gore and it satisfies in all three areas! The comedy may not be completely be inspired, but it is extremely amusing. You can tell that this is a true 90s film. The interaction between the two dolls is just completely hilarious. Take, for example, the scenes where Tiffany constantly scolds Chucky for being cliché and old-fashioned. I thought a lot of the material was fantastic. The film just hits all the right notes for me. It's satisfying in all the right ways. The gore is amazing. Both of the love stories were interesting and you actually care about the characters. I loved this film.

Really though a comedy was the right place to take the never dying Chucky because the situation was all ready pretty comical to begin with. Child's Play could be considered one of the blackest comedies ever made. The humor there was dry and mixed with horror. Bride of Chucky knows what it is and is willing to indulge into self-parody and for that I most give it tremendous credit.Brad Dourif reprises his role as Chucky who is stitched up and brought back to life by his sadomasochist trailer trash love Tiffany. Tiffany wants a traditional marriage and think Chucky is the one for her despite his maniacal tendencies. We are led to think that her attraction to Chucky is largely based on sex and sex alone. The night Charles Lee Ray was gunned down he left a ring on the mantle. Tiffany finds it and thinks it is a proposal of marriage and spends the next ten years searching for the remains of the Good Guy. Chucky tells her the truth that she was ****ing nuts Heartbroken Tiffany traps Chucky in a playpen and plans a grand revenge scheme for him by ridiculing him for being a doll. She gives him a present a bride his own size but Chucky is one step ahead of her and turns her into his bride I don't think anyone genuinely likes Chucky as a character but we love the scenario of a doll being possessed by vulgar sociopath. I was hard on Seed of Chucky because the humor didn't work but I like Bride of Chucky for the Tiffany character. She is a lot of fun and it makes Chucky all the more palatable. Child's Play was a film that worked because it created fear and because Chucky wasn't the central character of the story. Child's Play 2 and 3 were terrible movies because Chucky got the most screen time. Bride of Chucky realizes the scenario all though interesting is ridiculous and because it realizes this it is able to take more risk. Really though maybe Chucky needed a bride to vent all that homicidal rage. The interaction between the two playmates is the highlight of the film because their views of the world and marriage are so deranged and twisted that it makes for fine dark humor. Tiffany walks in with a plate of cookies that you all most think it is a 50's show where the loyal wife is at the husband's needs after a hard day's work. The highlight of the film is when Chucky and Tiffany are making love in doll form, I don't care what you think that scene was risky and hilarious.Don Mancini is not a comedian and he doesn't know what the movie going public will find funny. There are a few moments in Bride of Chucky were you look at the screen and wonder to yourself whether or not a joke was just told. I am forgiving to this however because Brad Dourif and Jennifer Tilly breath so much energy into their performances.The film is less interesting when our teens take center stage. With the iconic characters we don't care who they terrorize we just care that they get out and cause chaos. Mancini took the Drive-In book of horror clichés to create these side characters which includes an offensive homosexual stereotype written by an openly gay man.Bride of Chucky isn't a good film in the traditional meaning of the world but it is a hell of a good time for the horror fan who wants a good laugh. The little guy should have hung up his knife after this outing but his prophetic declaration applies to all horror villains.Go ahead I'll be back, I all ways come back... but dying is such a B***h!

Take it from me, I did not want to like this movie, but it was, as another reviewer put it, just a guilty pleasure. To me, the plot of this movie sounded ridiculous, and the title even more so, but I recommend giving it a shot. No movie about a killer doll and his killer doll girlfriend is going to be a masterpiece, but the people who made this film actually did about as good a job as anyone could have with it, and the end product wasn't too shabby. This movie is more of a comedy than anything, and as far as B-horror movies go, it actually has one of the better scripts out there, I kid you not. There were a few moments when I caught myself laughing out loud and rewinding scenes. Now don't go me wrong, some parts are silly, some stupid. However, in the end, I feel confident you will be surprised with how much effort went into this movie to actually make it entertaining and not a complete, retarded mess. Sometimes movies with low expectations that end up being a fun ride are the best rides of all.

What made it so funny was that they gave Chucky a wife and they constantly argued and bickered the whole time- kind of like a real life married couple.The downside to this movie is that it isn't really that scary, so if you are looking for a scary doll movie, skip this one. This one has a couple scary scenes but it's mostly a black comedy. Although I thought the death scene in motel was pretty awesome.It's a hilarious movie- go rent this one.

All three of the movies proved to be disappointed horror movies with comedy and no thrills or scares, at best. Of course, anyone could say the series died with Child's Play 3, but this is a horror franchise we're talking about, so of course they're going to make more. Bride of Chucky goes for a more modern horror movie feeling, and this actually works to its advantage to sticking out as the best Chucky movie yet.For those that don't know, Bride of Chucky has left Andy Barcley behind, so he's long gone. But Chucky still has some victims to fool around with, and this time he's gotten a facelift gone wrong. Chucky goes and finds the pleasure in making the lives of two lovers more miserable, as they're for some reason forbiden to meet each other. As if Chucky wasn't enough for these two, an old girlfriend of his is turned into a Good Guy look-alike. Conflicts also brew between between Chucky and Tiffany, but it also has the film act like it can't decide whether Chucky and Tiffany love each other or not.With some fresh faces and a more modern feel, Bride of Chucky also goes to making a bit of fun towards the series history and to other horror movie genres. There are also some teen-aged party, drug and alcohol scenes, but the movie keeps this more-or-less on the down low. The acting is somewhat cheesy, but not as horrible as say Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2 bad. The best performer of the movie is once again Chucky, his personality just doesn't seem to get old.Now, while this movie is a great step in the right direction for the Child's Play movies, it isn't without noticeable flaws. Again, the performances are pretty cheesy with the exception of Chucky, it's more a comedy than a horror and the movie itself does drag on with awkward parts. Other than that, Bride of Chucky a step in the right direction for Chucky's movie series and indicates good possibilities for future Chucky movies.

Bride of Chucky, from Ronny Yu, the director of The Bride With White Hair, injects fresh blood into the series and, thanks to a sharp, black, hilarious script by Don Mancini, is immensely entertaining. Yu, who demonstrates a deep understanding of marital conflict amongst dolls, creates a moody, gory, audacious comedy-thriller that never lets up and never insults the franchise. Jennifer Tilly as deliciously wicked as the voice of Tiffany and Brad Dourif is delightfully vile and foul-mouthed as the voice of the killer in a doll's body. The talented Peter Pau, who shot Hong Kong classics such as A Fishy Story (see review) delivers stunning images that raise the bar for future entries. The much-discussed sex scene between Chucky and Tiffany is a ripper and has only been challenged once since by the marionette sex/scat sequence in the brilliant Team America. The dolls are clearly making their mark, and not only does Chucky get lucky (bless his plastic heart!), but so does the audience. You can't beat that.

Basically the two dolls travel with two teens to the graveyard with Chucky's corpse, with a voodoo charm on his neck which will help them transfer their souls into human bodies. Along the way they obviously have fun making their drivers look guilty by killing many people along the way, in really violent ways. Also starring Katherine Heigl as Jade, Nick Stabile as Jesse, Alexis Arquette as Howard Fitzwater/Damien Baylock, Gordon Michael Woolvett as David 'Dave' Collins, John Ritter as Police Chief Warren Kincaid and a cameo by Kathy Najimy.

"},{"Title":"Easily the best sequel in the CHILD'S PLAY series.","Date":"26 April 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" BRIDE OF CHUCKY is perhaps the best sequel in the CHILD'S PLAY franchise! wherein the first three films took a more serious approach to a killer doll stalking the unwary, BRIDE OF CHUCKY take a far more comedic route & as a result, it winds up being highly enjoyable! It's fun to watch & it's jokes are always on target. It contains some pretty inventive kills & many gross out moments to help wet the appetites of even the most jaded of horror fans. Best of all, the film is loaded to the eye balls with pitch black humour & satirical references, such as Tiffany using VOODOO FOR DUMMIES book to revive Chucky, the two dolls have sex (we see their silhouettes on the wall) Chucky drinking from a fish bowl, pulling a ring off a severed finger & giving it to Tiffany etc. The dialogue is absolutely hilarious at times. The two fighting when she makes dinner for him & yet he refuses to clean the dishes. Being that the film arrived during the whole SCREAM series phenomenon, it's no surprise that Part 4 would be just as self satirical & self referencing as pretty much any theatrically released horror film of the era, however unlike most horror films at the time, BRIDE OF CHUCKY'S swiping of the SCREAM formula actually works here! it's cleverly interwoven into the screenplay, where it makes it not so obvious. Director RONNY YU & company let us know that this is a different, fresher, CHILD'S PLAY sequel, as we see a police evidence locker containing the Crate from CREEPSHOW, Jason's hockey mask, Michael Myers mask, Freddy Kruger's glove & Leatherface's chainsaw & Andre Toulon's puppets from PUPPET MASTER, which is cited as a rip-off of the original CHILD'S PLAY, since it came out almost immediately after it's arrival. A theory which I disagree with, since Full Moon Entertainment has been making killer doll movies long before the first CHILD'S PLAY even came out. Ironcially enough, MATT ROE who played a psychic in that movie, was cast as a cop in CHILD'S PLAY 2. By the way, if you don't know who any of these characters I mentioned are, then you shouldn't be seeing this movie! & HELLRAISER's own lead villain Pinhead is also referenced later on, when Chucky embeds a series of nails into a victims face, to which he replies Where have I seen that before? One of the characters is also named Damien Baylock which is a reference to THE OMEN, who's lead villain, a child, was named Damien & who's nanny was a woman called Mrs. Baylocks.Being that this is a new CHILD'S PLAY movie, the film-makers update Chucky's look as well, he looks like a stapled & stitched up Frankenstein doll. Not surprising, since the films title is a spoof on THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, in fact, that very movie is playing on the TV moments before Tiffany is killed, in a kill scene that was originally written for the death of the babysitter character in the first CHILD'S PLAY movie (the psychologically driven draft called BLOOD BUDDY) & replaced with a scene where the character in that movie is killed with a hammer, this is also spoofed in the movie, as Chucky considers killing a victim via a hammer to the head & Tiffany replies that it's To lame & predictable. Arguablly the stitched up look for Chucky is cited by many as being Chucky's definitive look. The film's main plot of the two dolls trying to return to human form, by switching bodies, is yet again the focal point of the film but it doesn't dominate it & it's not repetitive. However it makes one wonder why if the amulet Chucky seeks could help restore him to human form, (despite now being human inside the doll) he never went after it prior to this, is questionable. Wisely the film-makers do away with Chucky's pursuit of Andy Barclay & ventures off into an entirely new fresher direction. Which was desperately needed after the abysmal box office performance of Part 3 some seven years prior.The direction is great! RONNY YU'S camera movements & direction are really stylish & help suit the tone of the movie. It's very professional. The acting is even better. JENNIFER TILLY is amazing as Tiffany, nobody could have played that role like she did! KATHARINE HEIGEL...Everyone! I especially liked the late JOHN RITTER who does a terrific job of playing her sneaky low life, spiteful uncle. Ironically enough, his son Jason would also work with director Yu, on FREDDY VS. JASON some years later, another box office smash hit that, much like CHILD'S PLAY, helped revive the two ailing horror franchises. Also worth of note is how GRAEME REVELL who does a terrific score here, also scored CHILD'S PLAY 2 & FREDDY VS. JASON.In the end, BRIDE OF CHUCKY has more flesh to the characters & story & plenty of enjoyable new twists & turns, that it stands out as not just another CHILD'S PLAY sequel. But something far better than that. Everyone who made the film, was clearly having fun & it shows. Great doll creations by KEVIN YAGHER. Despite it's silly concept, the film is so much fun & a must see for horror fans! It's never once campy & best of all, it delivers a fun, highly entertaining thrill ride, that any horror fan would want. The ending leaves a set up for a sequel that ironically enough, despite this films huge box office success, took some six years to come to the screen, in the form of a sadly tepid entry entitled SEED OF CHUCKY**** stars "},{"Title":"Hillariouse!

Bride Of Chucky is the best of all the Chucky films because it does not focus on scares and violence, rather it focuses on the more important elements. Instead of having scene after scene filled with violence, the director combined all the elements of action, drama, suspense, horror, and even comedy into Bride Of Chucky. The only actor to act in all four films returns; Brad Dourif reprises his role as the voice of Chucky. Jennifer Tilly lends her voice to the Bride Of Chucky as Chucky's bride, Tiffany. Chucky and Tiffany fit together very well for a pair bent on creating malice, chaos, havoc and mayhem.Though Chucky and Tiffany are definitely the main focal point of this movie, but they can't make it a successful film by themselves. Strong performances by relative newcomers Nick Stabile, Katherine Heigl and seasoned veteran John Ritter made this a tremendous hit. Katherine Heigl may be known for her portrayal of Steven Seagal's niece in Under Siege 2 Dark Territory plays Jade. Nick Stabile is Jesse, Jade's boyfriend. John Ritter plays a police chief and who hates Jade's boyfriend, Jesse. I commend the creator and the puppeteers of the Chucky and Tiffany dolls for their original and unique movements.

I have never seen Child's Play 1 through 3. However, I am well aware of the history of the series, thanks in large part to the British ban of Child's Play 3 as a knee-jerk reaction to the Jamie Bulger killing. I came to Bride of Chucky expecting very little. A friend of mine said i should watch it and lent me the tape, so watch it i did. And i had a derned good time.This film wastes no time in letting you know where its coming from. In the opening shots, we see a police evidence lockup containing Jason's mask (of Friday the 13th fame) and Freddy's finger knives (of Nightmare on Elm Street infamy). From a locker, a cop pulls a bag containing the shredded remains of Chucky, the once goodguy doll who was possessed by the soul of serial killer Charles Lee Ray. It is obvious that Chucky will be resurrected, as were Jason and Freddy many times (most recently by Bride's director Ronny Yu, in the crossover Freddy vs Jason), and the setting is one of post-modern horror, as was fashionable at the time of the film's release, thanks to Scream and its disciples.The basic plot is this Chucky's former girlfriend, Tiffany, resurrects Chucky via some needlework and voodoo, who then kills her (whilst she is watching Bride of Frankenstein, geddit?) and pours her soul into a female doll of Chucky's stature. Tiffany manages to convince her hunky neighbour - who is running away with the girlfriend whose Chief of Police uncle has banned him from seeing - to transport the two dolls to Hackensack, New Jersey, where the body of Charles Lee Ray is buried. Once there, the two dolls will exhume the body, claim back the voodoo amulet which will allow them to repossess human bodies, kill the two teens and take over their forms. Its pretty weak at best, but lets face it, you're only here for three things - the dolls, some laughs and some grisly murders. And that's what you get. The Tiffany doll is brilliant and Jennifer Tilly - though i did miss her voluptuous form filling the screen - brings her to life wonderfully. Brad Dourif gives Chucky - now horribly disfigured, thanks to Tiffany's stitch-up job - appropriate levels of menace and sick humour. And the deaths are pleasingly grisly and imaginative.What is good about this is that it never really pretends to be anything other than ridiculous. There are constant references to horror movie staples, such as Pinhead etc., and the script consistently pokes fun at the state of affairs. And the whole thing rattles along at a brisk old pace. At just over 80 minutes, there isn't much screentime when some absurd situation or some blood-letting isn't in the works. It just sets up the plot and the set-pieces and gets on with letting them play out much as you would expect.All the people you dont really warm to get offed pretty quickly. Alexis Arquette, doing his best Marilyn Manson is the first to go, and while Chucky certainly puts him through some pain, the deaths get more elaborate as the film progresses. One of the best scenes sees Chucky blow up a cop car after getting stoned in the back of the teens' truck, and the reaction of a stoned spectator teen to Chucky crawling away and giving him the finger is priceless, and for me the biggest laugh of the film. It also has one of the films two impressive explosions, a minor note, but its always nice to see some good pyrotechnics in a b-movie.Some of the structuring is actually quite neat as well, with the two unaware teens gradually suspecting each other of the string of murders that seem to dog their roadtrip. And anytime someone new enters the fray, you can guarantee they'll get theirs. Perhaps the best death is a tie between the 'honeymoon sweets' murder and the resultant Final Destination-style splattering of one of the film's main characters. There's also a suitably perverse sex scene which was crying out to happen, topped off with a nice punchline, which sets up the film's final twist.And what a twist. Hardly unpredictable, but neat none the less, it tops off a sick and entertaining hour and a half effectively enough to warrant a further sequel. A date movie for horror fans, unless your woman is a) scared of murderous dolls, b) far too lofty for this sort of thing, or c)not into a bit of dark silliness. Otherwise, its a good little film, stylish and pacy enough to rise above Direct to Video horror and spineless dirge like I Know What You Did Last Summer. Give it a go - just don't expect The Silence of the Lambs. There's no Oscars here, and all the better for it.7/10 "},{"Title":"Good natured fun....in a sick and demented kind of way!","Date":"23 September 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  With a tag line like Chucky gets lucky you can expect a film that doesn't take itself too seriously and Bride... is certainly not a movie to be taken, or even attempt to be taken, in any way, shape or form, remotely seriously.Jokes and one-liners abound throughout the movie, and there are a number of visual gags that poke fun at other horror flicks (see the Pinhead scene, for example).The two dolls steal the entire film thoroughly and Brad Dourif (who has to rank as one of the world's most underrated bit-part actors) voices Chucky perfectly.If you like silly horror, then this one is a must-see. If, on the other hand, you think Scream is the height of the horror genre, I'd stay away.

Half the fun of Child's Play was Chucky's off screen mischief through the first half of the film, which could theoretically lead up to a Candyman ending.  Well, that couldn't carry over too well into the sequels so we got more of Chucky.As cool as Chucky is, the first two sequels just didn't quite work as a result (that and because the reason the first one didn't fully deliver came back.)  So here we have Bride of Chucky, a post-Scream self-commenting slasher featuring everyone's favorite miniature killer ever lovable Chucky.  Now the Child's Play franchise has something fresh again, and the parody vs scary trade-off isn't too terrible (unlike Jason X.)  Slashers are not scary anymore, most are standard formulas that give cookie cutters a bad name and are spliced together in post-production where the other unimaginative elements get stuck together to create a half baked glob of stuff we've tasted before (prepared by better people).  Chucky isn't scary anymore.  BoC acknowledges this and shoots for a different approach and fairs pretty well in the craft department (surprisingly) . . . it's a distinct cut above the average horror flick.  So it's far better than I expected, and I admit after the first 3 films and just hearing the title of this one I could not see how this movie would be remotely worth the $1.08 rental.  It's nice to be surprised.  It is a relief that at least a few horror flicks acknowledge their worn formula and have drifted to this parody approach (some with more success than others), and after viewing Ronny Yu's work on Freddy Versus Jason I don't see how FvsJ could've been done any other way successfully.  Yu has a talent for throwing a few interesting wrenches into old-school horror and making them worth getting back into . . . Bride of Chucky is easily my favorite of the Child's Play movies, though I love Chucky's comments throughout the entire franchise.  Finally he has someone to play off of, and Jennifer Tilly's performance of Tiffany does a fine job keeping up with Chucky's wit.  The two dolls constant bickering is half the reason to watch this movie.

What I got wasn't what was expected. This movie was actually better than the three flicks behind it! Ever since seeing it in theaters, I have bought it on VHS and DVD and have watched it hundreds of times. This is easily one of the most entertaining horror movies out there. Sure, Chucky isn't scary in this flick, but really, could he be scary anymore. Everyone knows who he is (you aren't scared of Freddy Krueger anymore, are you?). 'Bride of Chucky' takes a more comedic route that isn't afraid to make fun of itself. Almost all of the murders are excessively unrealistic and Chucky spouts off lines such as If this was a movie, it would take 3 or 4 sequels just to do it justice and I'm ALL rubber! (you'd have to see the scene). In this movie, Chucky is pieced back together (after being chopped up in part 3) by his former lover Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly). When things turn sour, Chucky kills Tiffany and transfers her soul into a doll, via voodoo. The duo takes a road trip with unsuspecting runaway couple Jade (Heigl) and Jesse (Stabile) to New Jersey to uncover Chucky's dead body so they can find a special jewel that will allow them to be human again. Confused? Far-fetched? Don't worry. The movie is thoroughly entertaining and is directed with an dazzling visual flare by Ronny Yu ('Formula 51,' the upcoming 'Freddy Vs. Jason'). I honestly can't find a flaw in this movie. Everything about it is wonderful. It's funny, it's bloody, and it even has an awesome soundtrack. Chucky fans will not want to miss out on this one.

OK!!!","Date":"7 February 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  The Kids of the Eighties like us - who grew up watching Chucky over the years but unfortunately had the same height as 'our star' at that particular time were turned away at the Movie house with a warning of 'don't you even think about it, Kiddo!!'  Now these 'Big' kids are excited to have passed the R rating 10 years later to go and finally see him Back in the Big Silver Screen - Yaaaaaay!The world's favourite Serial Killer doll is cooler than ever to be Fantastically Vocalised as always by Genre Star Brad Dourif, but this time brings a lil' Honey.Charles Lee Ray's Ex-lover, Tiffany, is wonderfully played and later voiced by Sexy Jennifer Tilly as Chucky's Playmate and Partner-in-crime, better than Chucky's first pal Eddie Caputo and makes Barbie look like a plain Jane which is a great addition to the film.  Tiffany patches up her man from a horrible end to 'Number 3' and brings him back to life with a book, VOODOO FOR DUMMIES, bribes Chucky to animate with teasing comments and manages to bump off a Marilyn Manson- Alex Arquette- which makes people think twice about body piercings.Tiffany is happy with the result and hopes everything is champaigne and red roses, WRONG!! - because she thought Chucky would pop the question on the night he was killed, she obtained a Diamond ring on his Mantlepiece - but he told her that he took it as a trophy from Vivian Van Pelt (one of his victims on his snuff list)and told Tiffany she was nuts and letted out a mad-capped laugh, she felt humiliated and was enraged, and locked him up in a play pen to provoke him then brought a female Bridal doll for spite, However Chucky had a master plan......While watching the box and taking a bath, Chucky was on the loose by sawing his way out, Chucky pushes the T.V. into the water and Tiffany dies by being buzzed by a lethal combo of floated entertainment called Bride of Frankenstein (Geddit?!).Tiffany's spirit was transferred into the bridal doll by that ol' spell and now has the dress she always wanted but she is now pint-sized!!! To be Human again, C&T need the amulet from Chucky's Human body-which was buried in Hackensack, New Jersey.Enter Teenagers- Jade (Heigl) and Jesse(Stabile), who are the perfect target for the latex duo, but were eloping away from Ritter portrayed as a brilliant Villain in the movie, but Bodies are being left at their trail to be pinned as the blame, and to quickly pick up cash in Hackensack's Cemetary written on Tiffany's note is the only escape route for the sake of their love.Ok! in my opinion is it the best sequel left from Chucky 2, it has more humour, especially when Tiffany explains that he is 'too eighties' and should be creative, Ritter becomes Pin-head when his face is a pin cushion, and as a dear friend of Jesse and Jade splatters all over the freeway Chucky nudges at her and peeps up 'that works too'. Chucky always had a sick humour, but does not alter his Evil side which is a good thing.What really made us curled up and die of laughter was the memorable love-making scene between Chucky and Tiffany which is HOT enough to make plastic melt, if my memory serves me correct somebody done a loud wolf whistle in the audience and that made it worse, better than creating scenes ourselves as kids over the years for banging nude Barbie and Ken together at elementary school.I am not gonna give away too much but Chucky made a protest at his death scene when Jade pointed a gun 'Go ahead Shoot, I will come back, I'll always come back....but dying is such a bitch'- and that made me applaud because due to the habitual ritual of the 'baddie dies at the end of every movie'.With a great ending, make way for Chucky 5.

I haven't seen any of the previous Chucky films, but I know the basic gist of the original (a serial killer inhabits a doll) and didn't feel in any way lost.  First off, I must say any movie that plays Living Dead Girl by Rob Zombie in the opening credits is in my cool book.  You couldn't have picked a better song to open the film.  I made a student film in which I edited an opening montage set to Rob Zombie's Superbeast and that was the only part of the movie I was proud of.  The movie is packed with dark, tongue-in-cheek humor.  One thing you can't accuse this movie of is not being original.  Name another movie with a doll-on-doll sex scene!  The scene contains my favorite line in the movie.  Chucky's bride asks him, Do you have a rubber?  Chucky responds, I'm ALL rubber!  Classic!

After the first one, inspiration was hard to find. We could bare part 2, but 3 was just 2 bad. Don Mancini (now preparing part 5 with Chucky's son) didn't think he would continue after Child's Play 3 in 1991, but because of the success of the interesting Scream and the terrible I know what you did last summer, he decided to bring the Good Guy back to life. Bride of Chucky is a very funny movie. Brad Dourif, who will be in The Lord Of The Rings-The Two Towers as Grima Wormtongue, does a excellent job and invents some hilarious one-liners. The black humour is just a chiller. The best part is when Chucky sees himself in the grave. But we must not forget Jennifer Tilly, who turns out to be an fine partner for Dourif, and who will be back in Child's Play 5 (2003). The story is not so important (what story?), but to see Chucky and Tiffany making love is the best thing that could ever happen to us in a horror movie, right? It's just the most romantic scene I have ever seen. I am curious about what Chucky Jr. will look like... Anyway, he has some wonderful parents. I can recommend Bride of Chucky, because besides all the humour the bloodfans will not be disappointed.

He looks terrible.         Tiffany locks Chucky in a cage when he says he didn't love her enough to marry her and to irk him off even more, she bought him a bride doll. This meant war.

Jesse took along his girlfriend Jade, but Jade's uncle is the mean Police Chief Kincaid. He has an officer, Norton, tail them around all the time. Both Kincaid and Norton are killed by Chucky, but Jesse and Jade are framed. Pretty soon, they find out Chucky and Tiffany are live dolls.

Being 18 now and finally getting to see the first Child's Play and having vivid memories of the second, I was quite pleased with all that I saw in them.  At first I was a bit iffy on seeing the newest installment, I had heard about it a bit my freshman year in High School, I thought it was a bit stupid and then the other night it comes on Sci-Fi, following the third movie, I said Eh, why not and man am I glad I did.  ***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** The best part of this movie is, of course, Brad Dourif, the voice of Chucky, that laugh of his is trademark and the way he delivers the lines is great, I couldn't think of a better person to voice the doll.  Jennifer Tilly was also quite good as Tiffany, though the Satanic voodoo angle wore thin on me being a Christian as I am, but I find the humor coupled with the gore to be a movie made simply to confuse and entertain the Child's Play fans who have been waiting for Chucky to make a return.  I found Kathy Najimy's role as the maid in the scene when the other couple was murdered with the glass from the mirror to be amusing, being completely oblivious as she was (Reminded of her role in Hocus Pocus as Mary, the very unaware one).I can see where Jessie and Jade fit in with this, they're kind of a way to symbolize Charles Lee Ray and Tiffany in a less psychotic, but more of a confused version, impressionable, if Chucky and Tiffany got their way and got into the bodies of these two, it could have been another kids gone wrong example with no one knowing the reality of it, but thats the thing, where would the other movies be?Like a lot of movies, there were unrealistic parts of it, such as the dolls fighting, Chucky stabbing Tiffany and them not having slept together but a few days before and the baby not only being born, but surviving being stabbed.

AKA Chucky, and it had some cool killing scenes.. Like the nails in the head.. And it tried to be funny too.. But It was a good thing they called it the Bride of Chucky.. Because it was no child's play.. It wasn't even a horror, really.. I have always believed that in horror movies there is a lot of room for change, so that you character can grow into something maybe a little more than what he started as.. Sometimes, you have things like The Leprechaun Series, that changes from movie to movie, which was o.k because even though Warwick Davis was always the Leprechaun, he was a new different one in every movie.. But in this case the changes they made are unforgivable, and un called for.. Charles in part one preformed Voodoo, on a doll in a store because he needed a person and that was all he could get his hands on and he was dieing.. He was taught this Voodoo from a man he later killed in the movie.. The rule is and can't be changed that the longer he stays in the body the more he becomes it, for example, at first you can shoot him all you want he has no blood, he can't be hurt, but after being in the doll he starts turning and the body starts to feel pain, and he even bleeds, if he doesn't change into a human body, before he becomes human in the doll, he will be forever trapped in the Good Guy Doll.. The only way he can get out of the doll is to perform that same Voodoo in which he did to get into the doll he is in.. And more important, the only body he can do that to is the body of the first person he told who he was in the doll.. That person is Andy Barclay , Andy is the only person Chucky can use to get in a new body, in parts 2 and 3 he was givin' a new body (doll) in two he was recreated with new parts, in a sense rebuilt, and in 3 he got a whole new body all together that was mixed with his blood.. This is why they can bend the rules saying that chucky has a whole new doll, and this means that he can use the body of the first person he tells who he is with his new body.. Giving him the choice between Andy or Tyler, the little black kid he told.. In the Bride, he has no new body, the same one, so he had turned before, even if the Voodoo for Dummies could bring him back, he would be forever stuck in the Good Guy Doll.. But that's not the part that is all wrong, the part that is all wrong is that there is no Andy, and Chuck is trying to find some medallion, that didn't exist before, and we knew it didn't as the viewer, and so didn't Chucky, cause if you watch part 1, it clearly states that THE ONLY WAY TO SWITCH BODIES IS BY PERFORMING THE CHANT ON THE FIRST PERSON HE TOLD WHO HE WAS IN THE DOLL!!! The Voodoo Black man in part one, whom Charles asked how to get out of the doll said nothing of any medallion.. But in The Bride', it's like Chucky knew all along!! If this were the case, he wouldn't have asked in the first one, and he wouldn't have spent all his time with Andy, when he could have gotten the medallion, and picked any body to posses.. I find that most people who didn't see the others or didn't like the others liked this movie a lot.. It was a good movie, in fact I liked it quite a bit, but The plot was bad, and this movie made no sense, and it did no justice what so ever to any of the others.. And it lacked the great lines from Brad Dourif like, There's nothin' like a strangulation to get the circulation running!! But I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to give it a chance..

Because lets face it, the third one wasnt very good and after a ten year break theres bound to be a few problems with the film. I was wrong. Chucky returns with great force and really makes this movie a memorable one. Its creative and origional. Tiffany is particularly effective in bringing this film to life. There is even a bit of humor in this one, such as Tiffany using Voo-doo for Dummies to bring Chucky back to life and saying that her hero is Martha Stewart. There are a couple of problems with the movie, such as the whole magic amulet thing which was never mentioned in the previous movies. According to the ones before he has to possess the first one to realize what he is, meaning that he should have been after either Tiffany, that guy she was with or (shudder) Andy Barclay again. To me the saving grace of Bride of Chucky is that we are finally past the Andy stage of the series.

It was campy and it was fun, but to an extent. The first half of the film was silly, gory, and witty. The film makers just wanted to have fun with the premise, and it was entertaining. The second half tries too hard to shock you, and it gives up on the one-liners and replaces it with violence, and it comes off as the film makers are actually trying to scare you, and thats where the film goes flat. Bride of Chucky is about that a doll obviously named Chucky, he has been dead for quite some time, thats until Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) revives him. He doesn't like her human advantage and he kills her and she becomes a doll. They need to get to Hackensack, New Jersey to get some necklace off Chucky's real body to be turned into humans again. They hitch a ride with a teen couple, Jesse and Jade (Nick Stabile and Kathrine Heigl). The two dolls commit many murders on the road trip and the teens get blamed for it. Once Jesse and Jade find out the two dolls in the backseat can talk and maim, the film takes a downward spiral. I have only seen the first Child's Play, and it was a decent film. The 4th installment's campiness looked like a promising rent. Of course this films going to be gory, but there is so much of it here, it gets boring. (SPOILER!) And when Tiffany has that bloody baby at the end before she dies, that was just gross, and the gleeful smile on your face, if you still have one from the first half, quickly turns to one of disgust. Watch the first half for campy fun, and the last half if you're into run-of-the-mill(but more gore)slasher flicks.Bride of Chucky gets a 5/10.

Just rent Friday the 13th part 6 Jason lives. Wes Craven, responsible for turning horror from tres corny to tres chic with his Scream-series, also went down this road with A New Nightmare. Even Michael Myers got his turn to star in a fresh new adventure filled with nubile screaming (pardon the pun) teens to kill, a recipe for modern horror box-office success. And as you are reading this, Jason X is being screened and prepped for release. Properly done, a revamp is just the thing to freshen up a flailing franchise. Especially the Child's Play franchise. It's so Eighties...Let's face it, a possessed doll is a rather silly concept. SO why not have more fun with the idea? I liked the new direction the writers took with Bride of Chucky, turning it into a black comedy rather than a senseless slasher pic. Loved the Voodoo-for-Dummies bit and the little genre in-jokes are oh so cute, although not too subtle. The movie also delivers some stylish murder sequences done with a sense of flair not often seen in the horror genre. Exploding waterbeds and radios in the tub while soap bubbles fill the air. And let's not forget the highway scene, which even manages to shock ole Chucky into silence. And that doll's seen some sh*t, man!OK, so the acting is two-dimensional and the movie sometimes gets a little bizarre (doll's having sex, for goodness' sakes). The puppetry is amazing, humor as dark and strange as it comes and the final showdown in the graveyard, with the dolls walking towards each other aka. spaghetti-western, left me riddled with goosebumps. So its not Shakespeare, but it's not meant to be. Bride of Chucky takes the brave step of revamping the franchise, and succeeds.

The filmmakers obviously knew they weren't going to be able to make this movie serious, and have it succeed, so instead, dealt with it in a campy, funny way, and it SUCCEEDS!!   In BoC, Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly), Charles Lee Ray's girlfriend resurrects Chucky, and Chucky is none too grateful (you'll see why), so Tiffany wants to just keep him as a baby, which doesn't go to well with Chucky........... While the human characters (Nick Stabile, Katherine Heighl, and others) are forgettable, Tiffany and Chucky make us not care, and suck us into the story.  The script is very witty, and there is also a great soundtrack.  BoC is also not too long (not even 90 minutes), although it could go on for days if it were up to me.  Every aspect about this movie is fun and entertaining.  See this movie, and be prepared to laugh!!

Brad Dourif seems to have lots of fun voicing Chucky, and will always make his lines memorable.  My favorite conversation in the movie is when Chucky first talks to Tiffany, and she asks how he's been and he replies Peachy!  I don't know why, but it seemed so cool to hear Chucky say that.  Now onto some of the series' famous plot holes.  In this one, Tiffany had to chant Chucky's incantation to bring him back to life, but in the other two sequels he came to life once he was rebuilt.  I have no theory for this one.  The other was the previously unmentioned medallion.  Chucky could have transferred his soul into Andy before without it, but now to transfer his soul he needs this medallion.  (In the first movie, it was said that Chucky needed to transfer his soul into the first person who found out who he really was.)  My theory for this is as follows  Chucky was still the same doll as he was at the end of part 3, so he'd have to find that little kid that he told his real name to in that, but it would be too much trouble to find him when he could just get his medallion and transfer his soul into whomever he wanted.  Tiffany needed it because the first person who knew who she really was is Chucky, and neither of them would want that, so they need to find the medallion.  Like the Evil Dead series, the first ones were both almost strictly horror, the middle ones added some dark comedy, and the last ones were both almost all comedy.  Bride of Chucky is loads of fun to watch, it is more entertaining than all of the other three, but the first one is still the best.  The girl who plays Jade is very pretty, but Jennifer Tilly is gorgeous as always.  While the ends of the first three left you wondering whether or not there would be a sequel, this one leaves almost no doubt.  If the next movie, which as of now is called Son of Chucky, is half as entertaining as this one, I'll be one of the first people in line to see it.

It is filled with comedic lines about Martha Stuart,  doll's anatomy,  masturbation, and it was actually done effectively during gruesome and disturbing images.    The movie wasn't scary or suspenseful and I'm sure that it wasn't the director's intention.  It was fun because of the silliness,    Jennifer Tilly's over the top and sexy performance.   The puppetry of the dolls were so well handled,  the movement of mouth,  lips,   tears in eyes,   knife in chest,  and the costumes. The dolls were just marvelous and it made the gruesome deaths more enoyable considering the fact that they were done by wonderful dolls.   The new Chucky look was great and Tiffany was very cute.   A few scenes with Chucky hugging the human Tiffany even made my father smile.  Jesse and Jade were surprisingly well- very attractive and the special effects were cool.  The ending was so unsuspected and the fact that they could make another as good is quite unlikely.

Bride Of Chucky is the best of all the Chucky films because it does not focus on scares and violence. The only actor to act in all four films returns; Brad Dourif reprises his role as the voice of Chucky. Jennifer Tilly lends her voice to the Bride Of Chucky as Chucky's bride, Tiffany. Chucky and Tiffany fit together very well for a pair bent on creating malice, chaos, havoc and mayhem. I loved how the director went in a different direction than with the other films in the series. Instead of having scene after scene filled with violence, the director combined all the elements of action, drama, suspense, horror, and even comedy into Bride Of Chucky. Though Chucky and Tiffany are definitely the main focal point of this movie, but they can't make it a successful film by themselves. Strong performances by relative newcomers Nick Stabile, Katherine Heigl and seasoned veteran John Ritter made this a tremendous hit. Katherine Heigl may be known for her portrayal of Steven Seagal's niece in Under Siege 2 Dark Territory plays Jade. Nick Stabile is Jesse, Jade's boyfriend. John Ritter plays a police chief and who hates Jade's boyfriend, Jesse. I commend the creator and the puppeteers of the Chucky and Tiffany dolls for their original and unique movements. Also, I loved the maniacal laugh that Brad Dourif created after each crime Chucky and Tiffany commited.

The third 'Child's Play' appeared to be the last, much like 'Freddy's Dead' and 'Jason Goes to Hell.' It was time for some fresh blood to come in.

I don't think its true but I wonder and ask myself this question. Not only about budget and Don Manici's disappointment for the film (saying it was his least favorite), but was it the harsh, indirect controversy towards the film that they decided to stop and then take Chucky away from his Horror roots, introducing him into Comedy??? Now don't get me wrong. I liked Bride of Chucky for what it was. I personally think it is a totally different viewing experience to the previous three which were darker, scarier and more suspenseful. This fourth entry in the series does a sort of rehash, mixing the horror, turning the film in a black comedic side, splitting time waster. I also don't think its a waste of time, but I do think that the film is not as intriguing as the first three. Like the two previous sequels however, I do think this film suffers from a few problems. Maybe even a few more than Child's Play 2 & 3.I will go through some positives and negatives. There aren't many, but there are a few more than the other films.Pros The film's turn to black humor wasn't such a bad idea. Because of its campy style, Brad Dourif's excellent voice and the rest of the acting working well, as well as the use of campy songs and the composer (who did CP2) to come back and take on the job with the music score. All these little elements with some tense kills, catchy moments and quirky language made for a fun Chucky film. I found it to be a very different viewing experience from Child's Play 3, because that one was just totally dark. I like the scarier Chucky films better, but having Comedy and keeping some of that intense stuff occurring was a great achievement, which I thought would have fell apart by now.Negatives Despite the film being on an excellent level with Horror and Comedy, having great actors and excellent, and more bloodier kills, I think the film (like Child's Play 2 & 3) have a few problems. The transferring the soul concept is way out of hand, and it becomes much more messier. Using an amulet, silly, just silly! I thought that the climax of the graveyard scene was shot well, but I thought that at times it just dragged on for too long. I felt as if it just lagged too much. Lastly, (I know its a comedy/horror, and by this stage it wasn't going to be realistic!) I think that Chucky just isn't scary. Back in the first film, we didn't see him, so it built up the tension and suspense. It was better when he wasn't seen. Oh well, maybe I was just nitpicking there, but Chucky doesn't have as much charm I think like the original.Still liking the film today, I think it is a good time water if you're feeling bored, and you are watching it alone or with friends. The plot is good enough for what its worth as the acting is paced well. The scenes are paced well (Unlike Seed of Chucky, which was a major blow). It is a good sequel, just not the greatest one.7 Stitched Dolls outta 10.

The filmmakers who are deliberately trying to make a bad movie are the worst of the bunch. Especially because Child's Play is one of the few horror milestones that is actually somewhat scary. When you see Chucky making the most awkward inside jokes outside of The Simpsons ever, you can't help but dying a little inside. He blatantly refers to Pinhead, says his story is so complicated it needs two or three sequels to do it justice, it just isn't that well written.

I always come back!","Date":"10 December 2004","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" In the world of horror movie sequels, movie monsters having children is one of the biggest clichés in the book. But movie monsters having brides? THAT'S never been done before!! Oh, wait. Yes it has. Luckily, the Child's Play films reside on this odd plane of existence that separates them from other horror movies while still allowing horrible things to happen in them. It's that world between comedy and horror where the movies can be a little bit of both and, most paradoxically, the expectations for quality are low but, for fun, very high indeed. At the end of Child's Play 3, my least favorite in the entire series, Chucky suffers a fate that lands him in a police evidence locker in what is most accurately described as an extensive state of disrepair. But coming to the rescue is Tiffany, his true love in the human form and something of a knee-weakening sexpot. She bribes a cop at the beginning of the movie to steal Chucky from police lockup since, being a true romantic, she is still in love with her Charles, even if he is dead and plastic. This is one of my favorite scenes in the movie, because inside the evidence locker are items from various other unexplained multiple murders &#150; Michael Meyers' and Jason's masks, Freddy's claws, and Texas' chainsaw. Being the first film in the series that heads in a genuinely misogynistic direction, it's not long after Tiff brings Chucky back to life that he kills her, although he still doesn't manage to get her to stop loving him. The love of the abused dies hard, I suppose. This does, however, lead to some of the best scenes in the movie, as Chucky transforms from the one-dimensional murderous doll that we know and love from the previous three films and into a murderous plastic husband. One of the movie's many highlights is when Jesse and Jade use stereotypical domestic expectations to turn Chucky and Tiff against each other and get them to fight. ('She's not much in the housecleaning department, is she Chucky?' 'You cooked, the least he could do is wash the dishes, right?'). I love how the movie starts off. Jesse and Jade are high school sweethearts conspiring to run away together, but matters are complicated by her uncle, who happens to be chief of police and no big fan of boys sniffing around his daughter. Chucky and Tiff, as seems to be common in horror movies that contain the number 4 or higher in their title, have a scene in which they discuss the originality of their methods of distributing death. John Ritter has a great scene where they lined up nails on the dashboard and then somehow set off the air bag, filling his face with nails. Chucky looks at him and says, 'Why does that look so familiar?' Looks like he wasn't so original after all!Charles Lee Ray's body was buried with an amulet around his neck that they now need in order to escape these wretched bodies. Tiff hires Jesse to bring them to her friend in New Jersey (over the phone he can't tell she's a doll), so they can get to his grave. Thus you have two murderous dolls being transported by two teenagers who themselves don't even know they're alive, and now the police are in hot pursuit because of the trail of bodies and missing police chiefs being left in their wake. As if Jade's nosy uncle wasn't enough&#133;(spoilers) At the end of the film we are left, as is generally the case, with an ending the leaves the door open for a sequel. That requires one, really. It is strange that a single detective ultimately catches up with Jesse and Jade once they finally get to Charles Lee Ray's grave in New Jersey, and stranger still that, as we learn in Part 5, a trashy British ventriloquist wanders onto the scene to remove the slimy, bloody baby before any more officers arrive, but the movie is so much fun that it's easy to overlook that. Bride of Chucky barely even sets out to be a horror movie as much as a curious, bloody comedy, so I think a little lapse of judgment is allowed here and there. Bride of Chucky is something of a deviation from the movies that came before it. The same main themes are there, but they have transcended the storyline that allows for all sorts of homages to be paid. Scariness is sacrificed, but quality and fun are not.

However, I am a big believer in freedom of speech and the other people who have reviewed this movie are most definitely entitled to their opinion. I hope they feel the same about me when I criticize this film.Basically, Bride of Chucky did nothing for me. It didn't make me laugh like some of the other Chucky movies did and I found it very tame. Watching this movie, I could hardly believe I was watching the same doll that terrorized poor young Andy Barclay in the first film. Chucky was a joke in this film.Some of my favourite actors were in this film such as John Ritter and Jennifer Tilly and Brad Dourif (voice only). But that didn't help the film at all. The fact that Chucky had a girlfriend in the movie only made it more ridiculous. Okay, the sex scene between two dolls was kind of funny but that was about it.The problem with some horror film series is the way they descend into comedy and farce. Many film series have been guilty of this. Freddy Krueggar was a scary son of a gun in the chilling Nightmare on Elm Street but as the sequels came, he became a joke. The four Texas Chainsaw Massacre films are also guilty of this. Scary characters should not become buffoons. Could you imagine if say, Pinhead from Hellraiser became a comedic character after a few films? Bride of Chucky was just so unfunny and I am afraid that it did nothing for me. I would like to see another Chucky film one day because one bad film should not kill off a film series but I hope the next film is a lot better than this.

Not only did it drop the 'Child's Play' title, but it also changed genres.The first three films played it dead straight every time. They were horror movies through and through. However, Bride of Chucky could almost be considered a reboot, as it uses very little of the 'mythology' from its predecessors and introduces a whole new concept to the franchise, i.e. humour.This is very much a 'black comedy.' Personally, I was never that scared of the original films and thought that a story about a possessed killer doll was hardly 'serious' subject matter to begin with, so I was okay with the change. However, Child's Play 'purists' disagreed.So, if you only see the Child's Play franchise as straight horror, I'd leave the series at Part III. However, if you're okay with some campy humour added into the mix, or are just a fan of black comedies in general, I'd give this one a try.Special kudos to Jennifer Tilly, who's brilliant as the 'bride' of Chucky in both human and doll form.http//thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/ "},{"Title":"Chucky and his bride...","Date":"28 February 2014","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Bride of Chucky is the fourth movie of Child's Play and in this one except Chucky we have his bride Tiffany.

That would seem to be the case with the Child's Play series based on the fourth entry, Bride of Chucky. After 3 previously straightforward films, Bride of Chucky disposes of any pretense that you should find anything here, well, horrific. Instead, we are treated to black comedy, one that isn't without it's moments, but on the whole a sign that perhaps it's time, like toys we have outgrown, Chucky should be put away.Set years after the previous entry, Chucky's damaged remains are rescued from an evidence room by Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly), who had been the girlfriend of Chucky's original human form, Charles Lee Ray. After performing a voodoo ritual, Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif) returns to life, but Tiffany quickly realizes that her hopes of the two of them settling down seem iffy. Chucky doesn't take kindly to being treated like a plaything, so he offs Tiffany and transfers her soul into a female doll. Both then decide to return themselves to their human bodies, so they hitch a ride with eloping lovers Jesse (Nick Stabile) and Jade (a pre-Grey's Anatomy Katherine Heigl) who are headed to New Jersey, where Chucky and Tiffany have plans for the young couple.Bride of Chucky, written by series creator Don Mancini, realizes that Chucky as a typical horror icon has past his sell by date, so instead elects to, a la Freddy Kruger, transform him into something of an anti- hero here, giving him, and Tiffany, a cadre of one liners to make him the star attraction of this entry. It wouldn't really take much, the plot involving the human characters of Jesse and Jade is about as limp and tacked on as you can get. Their framing device, and the ongoing plot thread that the killings being perpetrated by Chucky and Tiffany are believed to be performed by Jesse and Jade, are here because the filmmakers felt that they needed some kind of normal protagonists to play off Chucky. Stabile and Heigl get the job done, but nothing about Jesse or Jade is interesting, involving or memorable. When the film chooses to focus on them, it more or less grinds to a halt. All the good stuff is reserved for Chucky and Tiffany.The film contains the usual material you would expect from a slasher film, with a host of gruesome, creative deaths that are fairly graphic. That doesn't translate to anything being scary, however. There isn't much in the way of suspense in Bride of Chucky, and because the lead human characters are so lifeless, we aren't really finding ourselves biting our nails as to what is going to happen to them next. The screenplay also surrounds the leads with some enormously goofy characters, from Jade's overprotective police officer uncle, played by John Ritter as if he was in one of his many sitcom roles, to a Marilyn Manson look-a-like with the rather tongue-in-cheek moniker Damien (Alexis Arquette) who lusts after Tiffany.Bride of Chucky isn't exactly unenjoyable. Many of the moments involving Chucky and Tiffany are funny, and the film pokes fun both at itself and other horror films more than once. Mancini obviously knew what he was doing when he wrote Bride of Chucky, nothing here seems unintentional, so on the one hand I have to give him a degree of credit for going for the gusto with some of the humorous elements of Bride of Chucky. That doesn't translate to good movie, horror, comedy, or otherwise, perhaps a passable one, but nothing I would see myself revisiting in the future. While Hollywood is always good at continuously mining properties, Chucky is one that, this time, should probably stay buried.

Andy Barclay is absent in this one and Jennifer Tilly plays Chucky's girlfriend. The story goes that after Chucky was cut to pieces in the funhouse at the end CP3, his remains were stored at a police evidence locker. Chucky's girlfriend Tiffany takes his remains and stitches the doll back together before using the famous voodoo chant to bring him back to life. Tiffany ends up becoming a doll after Chucky kills her, but in order to become human again, they have to get a amulet which was buried with Charles Lee Ray (Chucky) years ago. We also meet two younger characters in love who end up driving the dolls to New Jersey where the body of Charles Lee Ray is buried.Several murders occur along the road trip with the two human characters unaware that the dolls are alive. Eventually the dolls reveal their true selves leading up to a rather interesting ending. The acting is very good in this one, and the voices by Dourif and Tilly are well done. Lots of comedy in this installment as well. That's really the difference between this one and the others. This is a horror comedy while the others were more horror thrillers. I personally liked the series the way it was, but there are some funny moments in Bride of Chucky.There are some gory death scenes which are done well. Much better than the third Child's Play. But it just doesn't feel like a Child's Play movie without the story of Chucky chasing Andy Barclay around trying to take over his body. The rules from the original story are changed. There was no mention of an amulet buried with the body in any of the first three.

That is not the case for Bride of Chucky, its a fresh start over after the last miserable mess. Its got great voice acting by the dolls once again and it revisits some scary moments that made the first two memorable. Though it still takes the dreaded Comedy factor in Horror a little too far, there are still enough jumps and catchy one liners that make the film good (the air bag scene and the Martha Stewart insult).The plot involves Tiffany (Tilly) a women interested in voodoo and talking to the dead, try to revive the old Chucky doll after, of course, being killed in CP3. She believe she failed, but sooner than later is killed by Chucky and puts her soul in a female doll. Now Chucky has a girlfriend, which then, like the title suggests, later becomes a beloved butchering bride. Chucky and his new bride begin going on a killing rampage traveling with two rebellious dating teens which leads to all sorts of slaughterings and gory fun. This film can be a little cliché, but its satisfying, scary, and hilarious to see two dolls run around killing people. What fun Bride of Chucky can be.Part of the prize that stems from this movie's greatness is the Honk Kong director Ronny Yu. He worked on several Honk Kong movies before starting working on American movies in 1991 with Rapid Fire. He would later become famous for directing the ultimate Horror match-up between Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees in the iconic Freddy vs. Jason, direct a Jet Li film three years later, and even do an episode for the NBC series Fear Itself which is definitely a must see. He is a great, underrated director, but it seems that the movies he does gets more recognition than himself. Bride of Chucky is one of my favorite movies to mix the Satire/Horror but use it in a limited form, so we're not just saying c'mon gimmie come scares. Still being succeeded in the best department by the first two, its hard not to call Bride of Chucky a fun Horror film and the best of it's kind.Starring Jennifer Tilly, Katherine Heigl, Nick Stabile, John Ritter, Alexis Arquette, and Brad Dourif. Directed by Ronny Yu.

That lasted for only seven years. Bride of Chucky was the rebirth of the Chucky saga, with series scribe Don Mancini returning to write the script & Chucky himself, Brad Dourif, making a comeback.Tiffany, the girlfriend of Charles Lee Ray, gets her hands on the remains of the killer doll from a police evidence locker (which has Jason Voorhees' hockey mask, Freddy Krueger's razor glove, Michael Myers' mask & Leatherface's chainsaw) & attempts to revive it using a copy of 'Voodoo for Dummies'. Chucky comes to life, kills her & resurrects her in the form of a female doll. The only way for them to regain human form is to get the 'Heart of Damballa', an amulet that was buried with Ray's body in New Jersey. Using a pair of teenage lovers, the duo undertake a road trip to New Jersey, with the police in hot pursuit.With Bride of Chucky, producer David Kirschner brings in Ronny Yu to direct, hoping that Yu would reinvigorate the series, which was already lagging creativity-wise. But the result is a film that seems nothing more than routine in almost every respect. The script is stuck with the same nonsense that mired the original trilogy, with the bizarre plot device of the dolls having to obtain an amulet in order to regain human form &#x96; I can see how Chucky became a doll, but how does he transfer Tiffany's soul into the doll without the amulet? Plus, Ray was killed in Chicago, yet his body is buried in New Jersey. How does that work? That said, what makes the film work (only slightly it seems) is Yu bringing in a sense of dark humour to the proceedings, with some cool deaths &#x96; a couple being impaled by glass shards; a guy being hit by a truck; the obnoxious deputy being killed as his car is blown up. The acting is adequate & the visual effects are better than the previous films. Besides the black humour, the film has plenty of in-jokes (the opening sequence has references to THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE, HALLOWEEN, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET & Friday THE 13TH, which when you think about it doesn't make any sense since the locations for each franchise are spread all over the country) & hilarious sight gags (the scene where Chucky flips a stoner the bird before killing the cop is worth the price of admission alone).

Chucky has a whole new, stitched up, more menacing look here; which I think makes him look cool, but many will disagree (or agree, many people have different opinions). Chucky is now more of a main character than an idle doll who is only shown alive during kill scenes. He has an actual personality and everything. We are also introduced to another living doll, Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly), who is actually an old girlfriend of Chucky's. Andy is no longer a part of this series it seems, which is probably a good thing. 3 movies starring Andy is enough. Here, we have a young couple as the main characters. Jade and Jesse. They decide to run away and start a new life together. And you'll never guess...CHUCKY comes along, and brings HIS girl as well. On the road, they leave a trail of death and destruction; leading them right to the exciting conclusion. This movie has gotten a lot of good recognition, which is well deserved. Catherine Heigl is very good here and; in my opinion much better than in Knocked Up. Nick Stabile is very good also for a small-time actor. Fans of Child's Play will either love or hate this.

What happened here!? Actually, there is a good explanation for this mediocre addition to the Child's Play legacy, if I may be so bold to call it a legacy. While BOC isn't the worst horror film ever to come along, it certainly is not the best. Here's how it breaks down.First of all, there are some good things with this film. It pays homage to other great horror films in hilarious ways, much to the effect of Batman Forever actually, if you remember the scene in the prison where all of the prisoner's personal belongings are being stored. Second of all, I love the way chucky keeps getting reinvented. The great thing about the Child's Play series is how they keep up with the overall story. Unlike Friday the 13th, which just gave up on how they should keep bringing Jason back to life, Child's Play always offers a reasonable and somewhat believable explanation why the good guy doll comes back to murder. Plus, Chucky looks really wicked in this film. I felt that with #3, he looked too much like an animated puppet, and with this one, he was completely fixed. There are also some cool death scenes, which are always welcome. But I'm afraid humor and death, while being key to a horror movies success, is not always the answer. A little thing arises called `plot' which this movie completely ignores.Follow the timeline back to the original Child's Play. Serial Killer Charles `Chucky' Lee Ray was aged in his late thirties early forties I'd say. And since no exact date was ever given in the film, for arguments sake, since the movie was made in 1988, lets say the events in the movie were also taking place in 1988. Lets also assume that Charles was 40 years old. As we all know, Andy Barkley is 6. Now fast-forward to Child's Play 2. Andy is about the same age, so Chucky is as well, so he's still 40 years old. Then in Child's Play 3, Andy is 16. so add 10 years on to Chucky's life and that makes him 50. Bride of Chucky takes place 10 years after Child's Play 3 so now Chucky is 60. Tiffany, Chucky's girlfriend, has been waiting to get her hands on the doll because back in Child's Play 1, even though we never saw her, she was Chuck's main squeeze. But Tiffany is only in her late 20's! So let's say she's about 28. Subtract her current age, 28, from the timeline years of events , 20, and presto! That would mean while she was going out with Chucky back in Childs Play, she was only 8 years old!!! Can you say `makes no sense'?As one could see, flaws galore! There's a scene where Chucky and his doll bride are sitting together in the mobile home talking, and this is really where it hit me that the series was dying. Between the aging Chucky doll and the new Tiffany doll, which looks like a Puppet Master reject, it became obvious how silly it looked! Aside from that, this movie suffers mainly from 90's pop/goth culture; Heavy Metal music with Chucky head banging? Come on! And further more, while there are some cool new death scenes, Chucky is an 80's character. I wouldn't want to see Pinhead put up a gun and kill people!! I want to see his signature chains! I don't want Michael Myers to all of a sudden use a flamethrower, I want to see his trademark knife. Chucky is supposed to stab, strangle, and shoot his way to victory, not blow up cars and set booby traps with nails! Child's Play belongs in the 80's and should never have been modernized to fit current day culture.Overall, it's better than some of the stuff that comes direct to video and gets shoved in the horror section at the video rental store. But it does happen to be the weakest of the series. Overall, on the horror movie scale, 5 out of 10.

It's like having George Clooney play Batman....kinda ruins the series. does anyone agree with me on this?

It's not so much a horror as it is a spoof of horror. There are scenes where Chucky and Tiffany discuss how to creatively kill someone. Another part has Jesse and Jade's friend telling them the difference between mass murderers and multiple murderers, and of course there's the opening sequence in a police evidence room with Michael Myers' mask, Freddy's glove, and a chainsaw probably belonging to Leatherface, or Jason, or...whoever. Like Scream, it tributes horror movies and serial killers. As morbid as that is, horror movies and serial killers are pretty much part of our pop-culture, and Bride Of Chucky gives a wink and a nudge to that.I can't believe I actually liked this movie, but I guess it's just one of those unexplainable guilty pleasures.My rating 6/10 "},{"Title":"Well hello Dolly!","Date":"7 March 1999","Score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" After being stuck in an evidence locker since he was diced in a giant fan at the end of Child's Play 3, Chucky is freed by corrupt cop Bailey, sent by his girlfriend Tiffany. Officer Bailey is quickly offed and Chucky is taken home in multiple broken pieces. Using bits off her massive doll collection Tiffany manages to bring Chucky back to life using another chant to the mighty Damballa.As soon as he's on his feet Chucky does yet another killing to get the circulation going. Tiffany is excited and can't wait to get Chucky into a human body so they can get hitched. But Chuck is dead against marriage and laughs in her face. Dejected, Tiffany locks him in a play pen while she blows off some steam. Not taking kindly to being locked up, Chucky breaks out and kills her by knocking a TV into her bathtub.Another chant to Damballa brings her back in the form of one of her many dolls. Angry with the loss of her nice, fleshy body and being stuck in a short, plastic one, Tiffany starts researching ways to help herself without Chucky's aid. Tough luck, the only way out is with the help of an amulet that was buried with Chucky's human body years ago.Conning a couple of local lovebirds, hick Jesse and well-to-do Jade, into driving them to the graveyard in New Jersey, Chuck and Tiff begin a cross-country killing spree, leaving a pile of dead bodies in their wake that the cops assume are the work of Jesse and Jade. Marital disputes between couples both flesh and plastic follow. Don't laugh, it's good! The formula of Child's Play was wearing mighty thin by the end of the 3rd film and really needed a fresh new spin to keep it alive. Don Mancini struck the nail right on the head when he turned it into a post-modern horror. Remember, this was back in the days when post-modern horror was all the rage so it might seem just the tiniest bit dated now. But compared to the endless Urban Legend, Scream and I Know yadda yadda films of that era Bride of Chucky seems to have the sharpest wit, the slickest direction and strongest production values.Director Ronny Yu gives us plenty of eye-candy and shoots the film with lots of darkness and deep blacks. A horror series like this needs technical superiority and imagination when it comes to direction and Ronny Yu soars over Jack Bender's mundane approach to Child's Play 3.Composer Graeme Revell returns and delivers a more sophisticated, if slightly generic, score to those awful death-metal guitar/synthesizer cues to Child's Play 3. His main theme from Child's Play 2 comes and goes briefly and he forgets the huge orchestral mayhem he did before. But he does introduce a very cool Twin Peaks-style love theme for Chuck and Tiff. An alright score overall that really should get a release on CD.Katherine Heigl is very easy on the eye as is Jennifer Tilly (as a human). Plus it also features one of my favorite actors, the late John Ritter, who died in 2003. Margot Kidder's gorgeous niece Janet also has a small role and Kathy Najimy (that's Peggy Hill for you King of the Hill fans) cameos as a distressed Motel Maid.My only problem is that the film should have been longer, with a more satisfying ending. Chucky has done the Damballa chant so many times now that I just want to see it work for a change. In the DVD commentary Don Mancini said that the film originally had Jesse possessed by Chucky and that the final showdown had more to it. I would have liked to have seen this instead of the weak ending that wound up in the film. For such an elaborate and imaginative horror movie, Bride of Chucky goes out with a whimper instead of a bang.That said, it was still the best of the post-Scream horror films that surfaced in the late-90s and the best of the Chucky series. The subsequent Seed of Chucky was still pretty damn good, but felt like it belonged in a different genre.

However silly doesn't simply equal good or fun as well unfortunately.I always thought that Bride of Chucky would be a fun one to watch. And I did had some fun with it but the movie is still being brought down by a bad story and approach to it.So the movie is more a comedy than anything else really this time but did that really had to mean that they needed to get rid of all the horror elements as well? I can't even call this one a slasher this time really, since Chucky really isn't on a killing rampage this time. I don't even know what he was doing in this movie. I mean, what was his motivation this time? It didn't seem like he was very busy trying to get his soul out of the good guy doll and same goes for the Jennifer Tilly character, who also got transfered into a doll and is the 'bride of Chucky' in this one.And then there are the Katherine Heigl and Nick Stabile characters as well. Where they really needed for this movie? Couldn't they come up with a better idea or story for them? I seriously can say that I would had probably liked this movie better, hadn't they been in it at all. It would had caused less distraction and perhaps would had allowed Chucky and his new bride do some more evil and gruesome stuff.I'm not really sure what they were thinking. Seems to me they had no idea how to find or create a good balance between comedy and horror elements and therefore went for purely mostly just comedy instead. I still wouldn't had minded this if the movie did actually had a fun and clever story in it but as it turns out, the movie starts to run out of steam pretty fast, after a promising enough first 20 minutes or so. And I also still really liked the last 10 seconds of the movie. I won't spoil it but all I can say is that's the most awesome Child's Play movie ending I have seen, even though it pretty much came out of nowhere.It also remains awesome that Brad Dourif keeps coming back to do the voice of Chucky. You would think that it really doesn't matter much, since he's only just doing his voice but it makes all the difference in the world really. His voice is perfectly evil and insane and I especially also really like his evil laugh.Can't say that the effects have improved really much. Seems like the animatronic effects for the Chucky doll really haven't improved that much, ever since the first 1988 movie. Don't get me wrong, it looks pretty good all but it's not exactly the most convincing looking thing ever.Another disappointing sequel unfortunately, while I still really had good faith in the movie, before I started watching.5/10 http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Chucky's Back and this time he's not alone!","Date":"7 July 2008","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Jennifer Tilly plays Tiffany, the long lost love of the serial killer, who inspired Chucky, the doll only a mother can love who kills people.

I haven't seen Seed Of Chucky yet, but I'm fairly confident it's not as bad(or worse, if that's possible) than this... honestly, it can't possibly be. I really don't think so. The plot is the most nonsensical and poorly written P.O.S. I've heard of for a very, very long time. The pacing is even worse than the third film, and, believe me, that says a lot. I think I would find it more thrilling to watch paint dry than to see this poor excuse for a Chucky film again. The acting is not as bad as it was in the third film, but it's close. The characters are the most poorly written(so far) in a Chucky film, and by far the most underdeveloped. None of them are really likable, so you have to just go by which actors you like or who you find attractive. Going by that, I preferred the screen time where John Ritter or Jennifer Tilly is on-screen. Unfortunately, that's not a lot of time, and I was bored for just about every remaining second of the film. The film is kept going through a series of 'twists' which act like introducing a small amount of electricity to a dead body; you get a slight twitching and movement, but it doesn't last long. New pointless characters are introduced on a regular basis simply to be killed off. The whole idea with Chucky's ex-girlfriend just seems dumb, not to mention the teenage couple that are our main characters constantly mistrusting each other... I guess it was supposed to make us laugh, but I've never really found Chucky the character to be entertaining or funny, I really just liked Chucky the maniacal serial killer because he was so interesting, cruel and creative. I don't know... the whole idea of the film just doesn't work. If you kind of liked the first three films, but you kept wondering how a black comedy featuring Chucky looking like a bastardized monster of Frankenstein, maybe you'll enjoy this. I recommend this to... um... well, I don't really know. If you enjoy black comedy far more than horror, and you like Chucky the character more than Chucky the killer, maybe you should give the film a chance. Just don't expect anything from it. It's not even worth it to experience the great John Ritter or ogle at the beautiful Jennifer Tilly... and that's coming from a big fan of Ritter and someone who's found Tilly incredibly attractive for a long time.

Either he provides the genre of horror with the new wind it needed or he is a below average comedian who tries to be funny by spoofing the big titles in the genre. At this moment he is working about Freddy vs Jason which brings the 2 perhaps most famous horror icons, together on the screen and in 1998 he brought us this 3rd sequel in the Child's Play series. I'm not saying he did a bad job on this Bride of Chucky. Not at all, actually. The Child's Play films were never great. The first one from 1988 was original and fun. It went downhill from there. The second one had its moments (a few) and the third one was barely watchable. If you look at it that way, Bride of Chucky is a good film. It's not required to have seen all the sequels. If you know how Charles Lee Ray ended up in the body op a doll, you can easily watch this film. It kinda picks up on the social life that Charles Lee Ray left behind when he died. His girlfriend from back then finally found the dolly (or what's left of it) and brings Chucky back to life. Bride of Chucky has a few gore and bloody moments but it's definitely more of a comedy. The whole film is built around the funny personality that is Chucky. He's a sarcastic, woman-hating, psychotic doll and that provides the movie with lots of quote material. All the little easter eggs make this movie funny as well. If you don't like the story, try to amuse yourself by searching all the references to famous horror film. That should keep you busy too. I wouldn't have mind if Child's Play 3 never received a sequel, to be honest. But if it did have to happen and that's most likely in Hollywood, I'm glad it turned out to be something like this. Brad Dourif returns as the voice of Chucky. This guy is great. If you're not familiar with his name or work, look him up. He played some of the greatest villains in movie history. The girl, Tiffany is a good role for Jennifer Tilly. She has the most irritating voice possible but that turns out as a great advantage for the character she plays here. In conclusion, the movie isn't ashamed to admit it's based on Bride Of Frankenstein and will provide you 90 minutes of good laughs. I'm not saying it's a great film but you won't regret spending time watching it. "},{"Title":"You looked in the mirror lately? Now's not the time to get picky.

He drives the remains to an isolated area where Ray's ex girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) slashes Bailey's throat & takes the remains back to her trailer.

The bodies of Tiffany's neighbour Jesse (Nick Stabile) & his girlfriend Jade (Katherine Heigl), who are both on the run from Jade's corrupt uncle Chief of police Warren Kincaid (John Ritter), will do nicely...Directed by Ronny Yu I love Bride of Chucky. The script by Don Mancini is great fun, very fast moving, highly entertaining & references plenty of other horror film with good affection. From the opening sequence where we see Jason Voorhees hockey mask from the Friday the 13th films, Freddy Krueger's razor blade glove from the A Nightmare on Elm Street series & Michael Myers mask from the Halloween franchise. To the clips used from Bride of Frankenstein (1935) when it virtually recreates the same scene. Bride of Chucky never takes itself seriously which is just as well, there are lots of one liners, self referential gags that Scream (1996) made trendy a few years earlier & it doesn't seem afraid to poke fun at itself & the horror genre in general. I love the scene when Jesse & Jade are having a clichéd slushy romantic conversation that Chucky hears & he makes funny derogatory comments & gestures throughout. That's not to say that there isn't a damn good film in there as well because there most certainly is. Director Yu manages to create good atmosphere & a real sense of fun, both human & plastic sets of characters are likable & shine as each pair suffer their own sets of domestic problems that the trail of corpses that they are leaving behind would obviously cause. Technically Bride of Chucky is great for the most part & has that big budget polish about it & at about $25,000,000 I should hope so. The only thing that I will say is that some of the puppet effects by Kevin Yagher are a little stiff & unconvincing, I can't remember any CGI scenes in Bride of Chucky either. Thankfully the film doesn't neglect the blood & gore with a cool slit throat, nails blasted into someone's face in presumably a Hellraiser (1987) homage, people impaled on shards of glass, someone being bloodily obliterated by a huge truck, a ripped off lip piercing & various stabbings & gunshots. The acting is pretty good & Dourif as Chucky is very funny as he spouts the one liners out. I also like the scenes with Tiffany at the beginning & find her very sexy when she's wearing all that fetish gear, I can't be the only one surely? I personally think Bride of Chucky is a fantastic film, total entertainment from start to finish, great humour & horror in equal measure & at only 85 minutes long it never becomes boring or dull. A personal favourite of mine, watch it as soon as you can!

Eventually, a rather angry Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif) escapes his confines, electrocutes Tiffany in the bath, and traps her soul in his 'bride' as retribution.Realising that they are now both in the same predicament, the plastic pair put their differences aside and decide to head for Hackensack, New Jersey, where they can lay their hands on the magical amulet that can relocate their spirits into human hosts. Tricking trailer park hunk Jesse (Nick Stabile) and his tasty girlfriend Jade (Katherine Heigl) into taking them to their destination, the psycho dolls embark on a murderous rampage, with their unwitting companions copping the blame.Although the idea of a kid's doll being possessed by the spirit of a mass murderer has always been rather comical, it wasn't until the fourth film in the Child's Play series that the makers fully embraced the sheer lunacy of the premise, opting to plays things much more for laughs than for scares (although there is still plenty of OTT splatter for us gore-hounds to enjoy).Talented Hong Kong director Ronny Yu oversees proceedings, deftly translating the witty tongue-in-cheek script into a slick and thoroughly enjoyable cinematic ride. Similarly, the excellent cast handle the camp material perfectly, with Stabile and Heigl making a likable couple, but smoking hot Tilly stealing the show as blonde, buxom, pouting, PVC-mini-skirted temptress Tiffany. Kevin Yagher's impressively expressive doll effects also go a long way to making the film such a success.Overall, this film is unlikely to find many fans amongst 'serious' horror aficionados, but those who enjoy the odd spot of mindless popcorn entertainment, full of twisted, black humour, crazy death scenes, and magnificent cleavages should have a blast.

I have to admit to not having seen the first two sequels, and I highly doubt that I'm missing much. As you might expect, Bride of Chucky is completely ridiculous; yet somehow, the overwhelming stupidity seen throughout the film is what makes it good; as after a while, it's much easier to simply not think about what you're seeing and enjoy the film for what it is. As I said, I never saw the first two sequels; but from what I've heard, they're not much good; and since there isn't too much that you can do with the idea of a mad serial killer in the body of a doll, spoofing classic films such as 'Bride of Frankenstein' isn't too bad an idea. The film focuses on Tiffany; a young woman that tracks down 'Chucky'. She was his girlfriend while he in human form, and she's looking to rekindle their relationship. However, things don't go to plan when it turns out he was never as keen on her as she was on him, and after punishing him; Tiffany gets hers...The film is directed by Ronny Yu; the same man responsible for such enjoyable trash as Freddy vs Jason and The 51st State. It has to be said that he certainly has his own style, and Bride of Chucky benefits from a superbly trashy atmosphere and a whole host of pumping rock music, which bodes well with the gory and silly plot line. The film is rather uneven, however, and while some of the jokes (the part involving Tiffany finding a wedding ring in particular), are very funny; while other parts of the film fall rather flat. Yu is keen to poke fun at the plot line and the entire Chucky series at every possible moment, although the 'in' jokes aren't often very funny. The doll 'sex' scene is bizarre, although Yu does make good by the end with a frenzied final half hour and a climax that leaves things wide open for a sequel, which the film got six years later. Brad Dourif returns to his trademark role, and once again does well at providing the voice for the maniacal doll at the centre. Even better than that, however, is the fact that he's joined by the extremely odd Jennifer Tilly, and listening to their banter is often lots of fun. Overall, this isn't a great film - but considering how bad it could have been, this third sequel ain't too bad.

With such a large gap between this and the previous film I think it was a good move to try and start the series over and that's basically what they did as Chucky is now going for laughs over thrills. This makes the film somewhat refreshing but in the end you're really left with a one joke movie. Chucky and Tiffany are certainly here for laughs and they get quite a few of them but overall the jokes are rather hit and miss. The jokes that do work are the ones where the two are constantly fighting over the woman's role in life and this includes a hilarious sequence where Tiffany gets upset after Chucky doesn't appreciate her cooking for him all day. The horror elements here are the most violent of the series with a lot of the red stuff flowing throughout. The impressive cast includes a fun performance from Tilly who perfectly captures that dumb blonde mode. I wouldn't say she gives a good performance but she does offer up a fun character. John Ritter has a fun but small role, which he handles nicely. Katherine Heigl is fun in her role but leading man Nick Stable is quite bland. Brad Dourif returns as the voice of Chucky and delivers more good work. There are a lot of references and jokes to Bride of Frankenstein and these here are quite charming and in the end this works as a cute comedy but not much of a horror film. "}]
