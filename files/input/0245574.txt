[{"Title":"A comment on economics and sexuality","Date":"5 May 2005","Score":"152 out of 200 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama","Review":" Y tu mamá también offers an extreme insight into the rampant sexuality of Mexico's young adults. The film depicts lives of two teenage boys against the backdrop of present-day Mexico. In his film, Alfonso Cuarón not only describes the sexual experimentation of Mexican youth, but he also addresses the impact wavering politics and an unstable economy has on the Mexican people as a whole. The film takes place in 2001, just one year after the election of Vincente Fox, a member of the opposition party. After about 70 years of revolutionary presidents, Mexican government underwent a radical change during the time of the narrative, as well as the film's release. Mexico has undergone numerous financial fluctuations throughout its history as a country, and recent years have brought along various economic lows. The extreme changes in economy throughout history caused Mexico to have a large separation between each of its economic classes. In his narrative the two young boys who take a journey to a beautiful land with a beautiful woman seem to represent the desires of most Mexicans during this insecure time. Julio (Gael García Bernal) and Tenoch (Diego Luna) embark on a thrilling journey filled with sexual exploration and an investigation of their inner selves. After convincing the beautiful Luisa (Maribel Verdú) to take a trip with them to an imaginary beach, the trio heads off in search of adventure. Self-discovery ensues when Luisa seduces both boys and convinces them to make love with each other during their last romantic encounter. The raw sexuality displayed throughout this movie seems to encapsulate the uninhibited nature of Mexican youth. While the full frontal nudity and unashamed sexual acts performed on screen may be disturbing to an American audience, Mexican cinema seems to embrace sexuality with open arms. While they do not leave anything to the imagination, the sex scenes throughout Y tu mamá también are beautifully orchestrated. These scenes absorb the magnificence of sexual attraction and the inhibition that comes along with this temptation. While the film utilizes the characteristics of raw sexuality at its core, the underlying message of the film seems to encompass the trials of politics and economy within Mexican society. Julio comes from a lower-middle-class family, while his best friend, Tenoch, is the son of a high-ranking politician. As their mental age begins to grow throughout the film, the distinction among their varying classes also becomes clear. It is this distinction that ultimately drives them apart. Cuarón uses the distinct lives of these two boys to comment on the state of Mexico's political affairs. While the large separation between classes is rooted in economics, the separation also occurs within the lifestyles and moral character of each class's constituents. Cuarón's film Y tu mamá también depicts the raw sexuality apparent in Mexican society, and also indirectly comments on the political atmosphere of the country. Through the use of a compelling story of self-discovery and the beautiful landscapes of the Mexican countryside, Cuarón offers his audience a glimpse of Mexico through the eyes of one of its citizens. While the underlying meanings apparent throughout the film are deeply rooted in the political principles of Mexican society, the narrative of the film introduces a moving story that forces its audience to fall in love with its characters despite their downfalls. On a scale of 1 &#150; 10, Y tu mamá también is definitely a 10.

Using three central characters -- two immature adolescent males and a young woman in crisis -- set in a road-trip situation, it was hardly a road-trip movie.  Nor was it an adolescent movie.  Nor was it a woman-in-crisis movie.  Nor was it about sex.  Instead, what starts out with a sizzling but ditzy prologue becomes something much deeper and much more profound as it goes along.  By the end I was breathless and somewhat stunned.  The character study is amazing.  The societal insights are haunting.  The shared humanity it exposes is painful at time but ultimately reaffirming and uplifting.  These are three of the most memorable, identifiable and completely human characters I've seen on screen in ages.  They taught me more about life and the human species than the last ten movies I've seen put together.  I'll not soon forget Julio, Tenoch and Luisa and their eye-opening journey to Boca del Cielo.

I believe the joke was that it should be called Latin-American Pie.  Now, I enjoyed the AP movies, and don't believe them to be crappy movies, but they possess no depth and substance. Y Tu Mama Tambien is much more sexually explicit than those two films put together, but it's in no way exploitative.  It's a slice-of-life story involving teens, and who's gonna deny that 80 percent of a teenager's life revolves around sex?The two main characters, though utterly repulsive in nature, aren't totally unsympathetic, like the characters in Larry Clark's Kids.  Through the narration, we get a sense of the characters' backgrounds and why they are the way they are.  We aren't simply thrown into this torrent of teenage decadence without a net.I'm sure very few people will regard this as a comedy, but it's filled with hilarious moments, mostly involving the explicit sexual conversations. Though it leaves you with a sad feeling at the end, it doesn't keep you depressed the whole way through.As well as being a character-driven youth drama/road movie, it's basically a film about life, most specifically fate and how it works in mysterious ways and how many people live parallel lives and simply aren't aware.  I'm not going to pretend as if I wasn't stimulated by the sex scenes, or seeing the Spanish actress who plays Luisa naked, but I didn't enjoy it just because of its sexual content.  Too many movies nowadays forbid you the pleasure of going on a character's journey.  Too many movies are all about plot, and more specially about plot devices.  Screenwriters spend so much time developing plot that character development is put on the backburner.  When you get to know the characters this deeply, you're able to connect with them, feel their pleasure and feel their pain.  Y Tu Mama Tambien is one of those rare, character-driven gems that is definitely worth a trip to the video store!My score  9 (out of 10)       "},{"Title":"Funny... but above all, a really intelligent motion picture","Date":"25 July 2001","Score":"96 out of 114 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama","Review":"  Alfonso Cuaron is simply one of the best Mexican directors in recent years in Mexican film production. His incredible AIDS-driven comedy, Solo Con Tu Pareja was maybe the most funny Mexican picture in a long time, and his always present criticism to the way of life of Mexican people in a city such as Mexico City, is incredible accurate and clever. His other projects in the United States, Little Princess and Great Expectations were beautifully-manufactured motion pictures, with the help (or support, if you may) of the marvellous photographer Emmanuel Lubenzki (Sleepy Hollow, and the above-mentioned Cuaron movies). Returning to his home country this time, Cuaron displays such magic and poetic visuals, in contrast with the subtle criticism to the society in Mexico, and the clever and sharp dialogs between the leading stars, using every word young Mexicans use to apply in their conversations.Y Tu Mama Tambien (And Your Mother Too) is, in the surface, a really funny story about 2 friends-almost-brothers, Tenoch Iturbide (an outstanding Diego Luna) and Julio (a really incredible performance for the recent Ariel, the Mexican Academy Award, winner Gael Garcia Bernal, in another excellent portray of a young guy with issues), that plan a trip to an imaginary beach, Boca del Cielo (Heaven´s Mouth) in order to flirt with a Spanish girl, married with Tenoch's cousin, and portrayed by a credible Maribel Verdu.But this is only the surface of this road movie. In fact, we are dealing with dreams and realities, with social problems and political ones. Tenoch is a young guy living with a millionaire family, son of a wealthy businessman with friends in the highest stairs of Mexican politics, with a second name such as Iturbide (one of the most important and powerful leaders of Mexican politic history). And, in contrast, Julio  is a middle-low-class guy, living with his mother, brothers and sisters, in a small department, with a last name such as Zapata (a revolutionary leader in Mexican history, with native origins, that took part in the Revolution at the beginning of 20th Century). This is a clever and sharp critic of the different models of living of these 2 friends, and in fact, of all Mexican citizens (I know it, because I'm Mexican, too).Also, the movie has an excellent narration by Daniel Gimenez Cacho, star of a previous Cuaron film, Solo Con Tu Pareja, that explains the things we cannot see, but that we can understand and feel. The subtle critic about Mexican society and traditions that I have talked about all along this comment, is the one thing that makes this picture go from a funny comedy to an intelligent essay of the lives of young people, social classes, discovery and re-discovery of personality and our own soul, and the final revelation of who we are and what we become when time passes by. In the lives of Julio and Tenoch there is no redemption, but a clear message of their goal in life, their true feelings about friendship, and their sexuality. This road trip is only a pretext to tell a story about discovery and finding our true nature.Yes, maybe it is a little provocative and bold, but because of these characteristics, And Your Mother Too is an incredible motion picture, true to its meaning and compromised with the reality it is trying to show. We care about this people, we care about their problems, and at the end, we care about our own society, and we care about what we have become with time. And the true meaning of the movie's title, And Your Mother Too, within the narrative of the film, is simply hilarious.Give this movie a chance, and see it. You won't be disappointed. It has an excellent direction, excellent photography, its is very sexy, it showcases credible performances by all its cast. But above all, it has a real story, real character development, and real power. One great movie from a great Mexican director. Maybe not his best, but really near.

Don't miss it &#150; provided you are not offended by sometimes-graphic depictions of sexual activity (please note that the film is unrated).  The matter-of-fact, unflinching way in which Cuaron films his sex scenes purges them of indecency and helps to bring a new frankness to a subject all too often approached by American filmmakers from the angle of tittering exploitation (wherein the directors and writers seem as adolescent in their attitudes as the characters on the screen).  Not so here.  The film centers around two boyhood chums, Tenoch and Julio, just embarking on their careers as university students, who, for one last glorious summer, decide to revel in all the wildness, hedonism and promiscuity that carefree adolescence has to offer (the title of the film is emblematic of the youthful immaturity of the characters).  With their girlfriends away in Europe, the two decide to take a road trip through Mexico with Luisa, the attractive young wife of one of Tenoch's stuffed shirt cousins.  While on the journey, the three of them not only indulge in all the bizarre sexual hijinks that both the situation and their hormones would lead one to expect, but they also learn a thing or two about life, about relationships and about how sex can be used both to bring people closer together as well as to pull them farther apart.  For indeed, one thing the film makes very clear both to the characters and to us is that sex can often be employed as a weapon to wound those we care most about, especially with all the power shifting that takes place even in some of the most non-sexual of relationships.  The boys also discover that sex can be used as a sublimation to avoid recognizing what one REALLY wants.  This awakening leads to a final scene that is almost heartbreaking in its understated poignancy and pathos.One of the most unsettling &#150; and thereby controversial &#150; aspects of the film (and the one that will make it uncomfortable for many in the audience) is that it refuses to take a moralistic stance regarding its characters' behavior.  The filmmakers neither approve of nor condemn what these young people do &#150; they merely record the events with an attitude of detached objectivity that precludes any finger-wagging disapproval.  If the characters learn any `lessons' from their experiences, they do so strictly on a subliminal, subconscious level &#150; and the same goes for the audience.As a director, Cuaron displays a confidence and spirit rarely seen in filmmaking today.  Along with his co-writer, Carlos Cuaron, the director has chosen to take an objective, almost documentary-style approach to the material, allowing the scenes to play themselves out in a way that makes them feel realistic, spontaneous and almost unscripted.  He uses a shaky, handheld camera much of the time to enhance the immediacy of the experience.  We often feel as if we are eavesdropping on the lives of these three fascinating individuals.  As a result, not a single moment of the film feels forced, contrived or artificial.  (Only the fate of one of the characters seems a bit convenient and contrived). Cuaron is not afraid to let the camera linger on a scene a moment two longer than necessary &#150; nor is he afraid to let the camera wander off on its own from time to time, such as when it spontaneously follows a woman into the back of a roadside café to show us the cooks hard at work in the kitchen.   Many of the shots even have an elegiac, travelogue feel to them.Cuaron has been blessed with three outstanding young actors &#150; Diego Luna, Gael Garcia and Maribel Verdu &#150; who bring his characters to vivid, endearing life.  Utterly naturalistic in their every move, gesture and facial expression, the three of them play off each other in such a way that we never doubt for a moment the truth and sincerity of what we are seeing.  American actors please take note!`Y tu Mama tambien' is a stylistic triumph from first moment to last.  It has a playful, expansive spirit, as reflected in its openhearted attitude towards sex, its wry humor, its affection for its people and its country, and its visual appeal and inventiveness (Emmanuel Lubezki did the glorious cinematography).  The film has heart, soul and chutzpah.  What more could a jaded filmgoer want?   "},{"Title":"Disruptive and unprofessional voiceover?  Puhleeeze!","Date":"28 December 2002","Score":"65 out of 85 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama","Review":"  First off, thanks to monty clift for hitting the nail on the head.  Y Tu is just as much a complex political coming-of-age saga for the country of Mexico as it is a silly little coming-of-age tale of two teenage boys.But let me take issue with those shallow comments that denigrate the voiceover narration in this movie.  I normally hate voiceovers in movies. I think voiceover narration is most often the lazy screenwriter's best friend. In American studio fare the voiceovers tend to be badly written, unnecessary, redundant, excessively heart-tugging, or all of the above. But Y Tu's voiceover is masterful.  First of all, the way the entire soundtrack ceases for each bit of narration is wonderful -- as if the movie is holding its breath while we are told another crucial nugget of the story.  This is a voiceover that is both razaor sharp in its attention to detail and beautifully scripted in its illumination of the characters.  Two examplesExample No. 1  Early on, as Julio and Tenoch are chattering ninety miles an hour with Luisa in the car, the sound ceases and the narrator tells us the following  Julio and Tenoch told Luisa many stories.  Each one reinforced their bond creating an inseparable entity.  Their stories, although adorned by personal mythologies, were true.  But as truth is always partial, some facts were omitted.  It was never mentioned how Julio lit matches to hide the smell after he used Tenoch's bathroom.  Or that Tenoch used his foot to lift the toilet seat at Julio's house.  Those were details one didn't need to know about the other.  Now that, to me, is exquisite narration.  In a few words with a couple of seemingly mundane details, we are given a novella's worth of insight into the background, relationship, motivation, and behavior of the two boys.  If you really listen to (or in the case of subtitles, really read) and digest these words, you could write, from this brief narrative fragment alone, a doctoral dissertation on the relationship between Julio and Tenoch.Example No. 2  After Julio accidentally stumbles upon Tenoch having sex with Luisa, he is devastated.  As he sits forlornly by the motel pool, the narrator tells us  Julio couldn't understand what he was feeling.  It wasn't rage.  The only time he had felt this pain in his stomach was when he was 8, when he woke up thirsty one night, and on his way to the kitchen found his mother in his godfather's arms.  Julio walked away quietly and never mentioned the incident to anyone.  Minutes later, after Julio gets his revenge by telling Tenoch that he had sex with Tenoch's girlfriend, the narrator gives us this parallel story about Tenoch  Tenoch had only felt this pain in his stomach when he was 11, when he saw his father's photo on the front page of a newspaper.  The article linked him to a scandal involving the sale of contaminated food to the poor.  Tenoch and his family moved to Vancouver for eight months.  He never questioned why.  Now if you don't stop to ponder the significance of these two bits of information about Julio and Tenoch, I submit that you've missed a big, delicious chunk of the movie.  It's all there, beautifully, in just a few sentences.  Why did Julio have the knot in his stomach after seeing his best friend on top of Luisa? And why the heck did he have the same knot at eight years old when he saw his mother in his godfather's arms?  Maybe, just maybe, . . .  And why did Tenoch's only similar pain come in a childhood incident involving his father and a family flight to Canada?  And the last words of each story - one never mentioned and the other never questioned - gives us another novella's worth of character information regarding Julio and Tenoch.Pardon me, but I get chills just thinking about the quality of narration in this movie.  See it, listen, read, and lose yourself in one of the most wonderful, multi-layered, character-driven films of this or any other year.P.S.  The acting from the three leads is superb.  All three could be nominated for an Oscar and I wouldn't bat an eye.

They talk and act the way most do at that age. This film is frank and honest with the viewer from the opening to the close. This is not a film that totally focuses on the whole universe around sex. Julio and Tenoch really think they have it all figured out but Luisa really shows them the ways on how to truly appreciate a woman sexually. This film will undoubtably turn some off. The film revolves around sexuality and is quite perverse. The film shows male behavior as it coincides with who he has sex with and how he pleases himself. Luisa,however, wants to teach them about how to treat women in a way that is more intimate. I will say that this film really raised my eyebrows. I don't come across a film very often that really understands the norms and peculiarity of male subjects like this film does. There are other layers to the film. It is an oddysey(or road trip)through Mexico and you see the signs of a badly impoverished and wildly policed enviornment. The film really displays the growth of the young men as well as the complex sexuality and maturity of a woman who wants to show them ways to better themselves toward the opposite sex. Maribel Verdu is excellent as the complex woman who truly comes to terms with who she is and wants to be. The film has a surprising element between the two teens that I never saw coming. This film really works on many levels. The narration to the film only adds more quality and fascinating elements to the ongoing story. *****/***** "},{"Title":"Three for the road...","Date":"4 April 2002","Score":"57 out of 72 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama","Review":" This is a very different Mexican film. One in which you can really appreciate the sure hand of director Alfonso Cuaron working at the top of his form with an excellent group of actors, which proves that when someone of this magnitude decides to make a good film about interesting characters in contemporary Mexico, one can expect a fine finished product.Alfonso and Carlos Cuaron have created people and situations that are very believable. The script is fine. Y tu mama tambien is about awakening and about reaching maturity. It's a great Mexican Road movie done with a lot of care.The Cuarons shows us a slice of life that could happen, not only in that country, but one that is universal. Producers and directors in Mexico should see this film and learn how to do future movies, even though the popular taste runs into the horrible soap operas, popular in Mexican TV. The Cuarons have turned out a magnificent script and have turned away from those popular melodramas that are a staple of the film industry of our neighbor to the South.Gael Garcia Bernal, who was excellent in Amores Perros, here demonstrates once again what an actor can do, given the right scenario and obviously a lot of freedom to give life to Julio. Diego Luna is also very credible in his portrayal of the son of a rich man on the road to discover himself. Obviously, the underlying theme is that both like each other, but it never comes out, as they both are so closeted and think themselves of being straight in such a macho atmosphere.Maribel Verdu plays the pivotal role of Luisa. She sees right through the boys, but has to play the part since they are the salvation from her miserable marriage. Here as in other Spanish films, she lets us know she is an actress who likes to take chances. This was the right vehicle for her and she takes advantage of a role that makes her outshine the rest of the cast.One can only hope more interesting things coming from this director and Mexico's gain is our loss, as it's obvious Mr. Cuaron's incursion into American films have not been as satisfactory as his work here.

(1960).Raging post-adolescent hormonal drives seem to propel Julio and Tenoch forward, with little else of substance to account for.  Likewise, Luisa's motivation seems more despair- than romance-driven.  Thus, the trio's trek in search of the idyllic Boca del Cielo is reminiscent of the forlorn lovers' quest for emotional fulfillment in the Bertolucci film.Comparison with the Antonioni opus stems from Cuaron's script seemingly being about a carefree, liberated trio on a journey for fun, when in fact, it's really about escape from their own worst enemies--themselves.After a particularly talky beginning (complete with abundant narrations) the film settles in on its main theme, and the dialogue becomes more pointed.  While the camera work is generally appropriate, Cuaron tends to rely on long- to medium-shots, with nary a close-up.  The result of this is a somewhat distant enactment, in which the viewer is held a bit at arm's length from the action.  One seldom gets close enough to become intimately acquainted with these people.  In the end, one is touched by important revelations which are crucial to understanding that which has transpired.  Yet, the viewer's emotional involvement is perhaps less than what it might have been, given closer perspectives.This film obviously impressed many people, and I must agree the work by the principles is uniformly solid. This is a last tango which has made its mark as a distinctive film work.

It's amazing how Gael García Bernal and Diego Luna, as Julio and Tenoch, work off each other they have a hysterical time, laughing and laughing.  I couldn't help wondering if when they shot some of these scenes they themselves may have been high on some of the superior grade `sticky' mota their characters love and praise so much.  These frisky pups, so eager for sex, so incompetent and over-hasty when they get the chance, having such a wonderful time with the sexy Spanish lady with the impressive tits, are very real, but quite symbolic the Mexican upper class and the lower middle class, inseparable and cautiously in love with each other, going to bed with Spain to acquire some sophistication; but wait! -- Spain, Spain is dying, while Mexico, as Luisa (the assured, somber Maribel Verdú) tells the boys, `breathes with life.' It's all haunted by mortality and pursued by corruption, and their summer is the end of an era for them.  Back in Mexico City, their sexual tutor is gone and they are no longer friends; it's over, la commedia è finita.  Julio and Tenoch have no choice but to act out their social destinies separately, as history decrees.Alfonso Cuarón and his brother Carlos have produced a movie that is as sophisticated and multi-layered as it is entertaining.  If last year's Mexican hit, `Amores Perros,' was a homage (structurally, anyway) to Quentin Tarentino's `Pulp Fiction,' this one is a homage to the French Nouvelle Vague and most specifically to Truffaut's `Jules et Jim,' itself the tale of two different kinds of young men, bosom buddies both, more than a little in love with each other, unified and separated by their far more sophisticated lady love, embodied by the sublime and unforgettable Jeanne Moreau.  The voiceovers in `Y Tu Mamá' mimic the same device so often used in many New Wave movies, particularly in `Jules et Jim,' and as in Truffaut's film they are a constant reminder of the fact that this is just a moment in time, that it all ends, and in Cuarón's version, the narrator talks about death, degeneration, road kill, disease, all kinds of disasters that happen around and before and after the events of the charming and ribald little story of Julio, Tenoch, and Luisa. The action freezes during these voiceovers to emphasize the momentary nature of the story and to break the jaunty rhythm with the introduction of an awareness of politics, mortality, and history. This goes well beyond the Nouvelle Vague model and as one writer has put it is as if the `American Pie' DVD had a director's commentary by Susan Sontag or G.K. Galbraith. Sure, this movie is hilariously sexy and ebullient.  But there's a whole lot going on here. The Mexican obsession with death is strong in `Y Tu Mamá' the combination of death and vibrant sexuality and love of life is a rich dish for a gringo palate.  But this isn't just spicy food  it's a brilliantly constructed movie that works on many levels.`Y Tu Mamá También' moves with an energetic and liquid flow from the first. This is very assured, almost blessèd, filmmaking.  Scene follows scene with imperceptible grace, never held too long, never cut short. The visual rhythm is perfectly sustained. There aren't any wrong notes. The whole cast are constantly alive and right.  Bernal and Luna just seem made to act in this film. (Bernal's beauty and his gifts are indicated by his presence in both this and `Amores Perros,' and his receiving Mexico's highest film acting prize.) Cuarón works with a rich palate  his cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, always has a lot going on in the frame.  In a road house the camera just wanders off and catches local people, an old lady stiffly dancing to a radio.  Mexico is constantly present without being commented upon (the voiceover doesn't belabor the images but augments them; the boys drive by many police roadblocks, oblivious of the repression).  The landscapes are subtly beautiful, never conventional. (There's so much going on that I couldn't think of writing about the movie till I'd seen it twice.)  But none of the peripheral action and scenery that make the palate of the movie so rich ever distract from the story.  All focus is on the story and its irresistible momentum in every single frame, so it's only afterward that you realize the full complexity of `Y Tu Mamá' and the beauty of its imagery. For me images that remain are a short tracking shot that goes over to the window of Luisa's flat and looks down to see her meet Julio and Tenoch and get into the car to go on their journey to the mythical beach; the country club pool, with its wide expanse, and the ranks of elegant modernistic lounge chairs behind a stream of water spraying the perfect lawn; the rich leathery tan of an old lady's face, momentarily glimpsed with a patch of red flower; a lovely shot in a bar, worthy of Cartier-Bresson, showing Luisa phoning her husband through a little window, while in an identical window we see reflected Julio and Tenoch playing a game of hand soccer; the pigs scattering across the beach at dusk and ruining the boys' encampment. Why some critics have called this movie lightweight (or even bothered to drag out the phrase `road movie') I can't imagine; I guess they overlooked the burden of sad knowledge (and the cinematic genius) amid so much happy fun.

In this story, Tenoch and Julio are two friends whose girlfriends go away to Italy for a little while and are left with not much to do (outside of partying and masturbation) until they get an idea to go to a secluded beach called Heaven's Mouth and ask the married and 10 years older Luisa to come along. She agrees after discovering her husband cheated on her more than she could stand and this takes the movie onto a road trip with dialog and actions that, despite having the be read on the bottom of the screen in subtitle format, is much better than most teen movies that go for sex related dialog (however, Cuaron had to go back to Mexico to make this type of movie so that the MPAA wouldn't s*** on it and make him re-edit it to a NC-17) and action. The only flaws keeping Cuaron's latest work from being a great coming of age tale is that the narration, while keeping in some good insight along the way, becomes heavy handed at times and gives information that is either humorist news along the area the characters are traveling or about the characters themselves which isn't a bad thing until it digs into things that don't have much relevance to the rest of the picture or even to the characters when you think about what is really up on the screen. Plus, the very last scene is too conventional to be placed as where the film leads up to (he should've ended it when Luisa goes into the ocean the last time).But still, these squabbles shouldn't stop people from seeing this movie, overall it delivers splendidly in it's uninhibited and mature ways. Props also go to the performances by the three leads and to the cinematography.

It is so refreshing to see characters behave in a way that resembles personal memory, if not actual experience.The guys are by often banal, bratty and obnoxious &#150; in other words, quite normal teenagers &#150; but not without their charm.

Do not read my review and just go see it. Find out where it's playing and buy yourself a ticket, in fact bring as many of your friends as you can, such as I did, and I promise you will all somehow have enjoyed it in a way films are rarely enjoyed. I do not feel that I will be able to describe exactly what I felt having seen this film, but if you would like to see my effort then read on.This is the story of 2 teenagers, Tenoch and Julio, best friends their whole lives, which have indulged in many of life's guilty pleasures. We meet them at a point when their respective present girlfriends are leaving to study in Italy, leaving the 2 friends on their own for the summer. In the short time after their departure we see a whole new side of the boys. They masturbate to the thought of Salma Hayek, smoke weed, drink hard, and flirt with another man's wife. She is a beautiful older woman named Luisa at a wedding, who in turn is Tenoch's cousin's wife. They flirt with her and invite her to come with them to the fictional beach Heaven's Mouth. She is of course reluctant, but takes them up on the offer after her husband one night calls her to confess he cheated on her. This is the beginning of the road trip to the non-existent beach that will change their lives.An unidentified man narrates the entire film, and when he speaks all goes silent in the scenes serving as a moving freeze frame if you will. He speaks the future of the lives we are watching these people interact with, and ultimately you begin to worry what will be of there own future. During this road trip to the fictional beach, all 3 main characters meet new and interesting people in new and interesting parts of Mexico. It makes them ponder life as their own past experiences begin to unravel in their intimate and personal conversations. Not before long the compounded sexual tension between them is in a way relieved, but to mixed consequences. All of the subtle characteristics of jealousy, anger, passion, naivety, become completely real.These characters are so believably acted, that when you see these actors in interviews or in other films you'll almost feel cheated. Relationships like this simply don't seem like they can be cheated; yet through some form of skill and humanity every element comes together just right, never distracting or deterring you from the story.Featured are some of the best-shot sex scenes ever (as one of my friends pointed out as a matter of fact). `Y tu Mama Tambien' finds a way of making all of it's moments feel intimate and genuine, yet never in bad taste. Alfonso Cuaron makes it difficult for us to believe what we are seeing at times is only movie, which serves this tale all the more. The shaky `Road Film Style' cinematography used here is perfect in capturing this uncommon, and unbalanced relationship. You are kept on your toes at all times, expecting something or someone to break. The dialogue is fresh and funny, the kind you just know cannot be faked, that in fact somewhere somehow the writer or actors uttered those phrases. I am convinced that a great majority of this film was improvised, whatever the case may be. 	This film is obviously more than flesh, more than experimenting youth. Take some of your favorite moments from mediocre mainstream movies like `American Pie 1 and 2' and remove all the slapstick value. You will realize that there is much more there than you ever saw before. That is what I think in small part this film strives to achieve. It succeeds. We can sympathize with theses characters every step of the way, because as we first get to know them you realize that they either are like you, someone you know, knew, or maybe someone you always wished you could be. By the time things begin to happen to these characters you yourself begin to feel part of their journey.This is an experience many of you won't take part in, and that is the sincere shame. Instead a great majority of people have been walking out of `The Scorpion King' unchallenged and un-entertained. `Y Tu Mama Tambien' offers a true form of escape, one that no blockbuster will dare. It's the lives few of us will ever live, for better or worse. What transcends from the screen to your hearts and minds is as eye opening as anything you'll ever see, and as effecting, if not more, as your own personal life experience. Bold words? Go see it and you tell me.Note Please feel free to contact me and share your thoughts on this film or on my review of it.

When looking at the movie cover and movie rating, perhaps the film seems like the Mexican version of a mix between Road Trip and American Pie, but after watching the film, deep life lessons can be found in the background of the picture.  After being enthralled with the message and theme of this movie, I was excited to test Linda Seger's theory, `Creating the Myth'.  I knew that most mainstream Hollywood movies would follow this theory, but was interested to see if this theory transcended both language and culture in this independent film. After the completion of Y Tu Mama Tambien an additional time, I was surprised to find that Linda Seger's `Healing Myth' theory truly explains the components Alfonso Cuaron's masterpiece. Before delving into the specific nature of the theory, describing the colloquialism of the movie helps explain the movie's cultural phenomenon. The audience is introduced in Spanish with subtitles to two Mexican teenagers, Tenoch and Julio, who are seemingly free for the summer after their girlfriends leave for a European vacation. Despite having to read subtitles the movie is easy to understand by the characters lively expressions and acting ability. Julio and Tenoch stumble across a beautiful woman, Luisa, who happens to be the wife of a distant cousin.  They lightheartedly invite her to go to a beach, really joking about it.  After Luisa finds out her husband has cheated on him, she agrees to go out on a road trip to a beach named Heaven's Mouth. On this journey, she seduces the teenagers and has sex with both of them. The sexuality of the film is realistic, which in no way is pornographic or crude, but rather honest and respectful.  In their journey to the beach, many scenes of the reality and blight of rural Mexican life can be seen through the windows of the old Volkswagen. People being searched at checkpoints, drug busts, deadly traffic accidents, and poor villagers walking the streets, all give the film an underlying message reminding that many people are left behind in rich economies, penniless and hopeless. Once reaching the beach, they are in paradise and relax and live in the beauty of nature. As the teenagers have to go home, Luisa decides to stay at the beach. The ending shocks the audience with a surprising twist.  It is revealed that Luisa knew she had had cancer and soon died after the guys left.  Much meaning is added to the movie after this realization is made and Luisa's character takes on a true mold of the healing myth. Seger's theory begins by stating, `All of us have similar experiences' (Seger 161). This theory therefore not only applies to American films, but all people in all cultures.  This is evident in seeing the two seventeen year old Mexican teenagers in this film.  The emotions, growing up, searching for oneself; all humans can relate to this. Although the film does not fit the popular mold of the Hero Myth, it fits the Healing Myth mold almost perfectly. The one-line description of this myth is `some character is 'broken' and must leave home to become whole again' (Seger 165).  Luisa, the attractive female is this broken person, who flees home for two main reasons.  The reason the audience is led to believe for most the film is because of her husband's affairs, she has left the life in Mexico to get away from her problems.  What the audience does not realize during the duration of the flick, is that Luisa is actually diagnosed with cancer, and is terminally ill.  Her need for rejuvenation and balance takes her to Heaven's Mouth and allows her to become whole again. She does this by simply living a life which is meaningful and seeking the truth. In telling colorful stories of old times and sucking the marrow out of all interactions, this allows her to become whole and ready to die. In realizing her frailty and death, she realizes the importance to live up to the ideal of  `living life to the fullest'. As Seger's theory gets more specific, it discusses the many ways the character can be broken.  Whether spiritual, physical, emotional, or even sexual, the journey which the character goes must heal the broken aspect of them. Luisa is broken on many levels.  The one that is apparent to the audience is the sexual and emotional brokeness.  She cries her self to sleep after she hears her husband has cheated on her and sexually misses his love and presence. This is the `outer wound' in a sense that the audience can see it. Just as the theory states, this outer wound forces Luisa into exile, which begins her process of transformation.  Seger discusses the `inner wound' as something that the character does not know about.  This is a different variation in the theory because in fact Luisa knows that she is suffering from cancer. The interesting twist is that the audience is the one who does not know about this wound and is hidden until the film's conclusion. Although this shows a difference from the theory and the film, it does not disprove the theory.  It is merely a trapping which is a product of the culture. As Seger states, `The trappings may be different, the twist and turns that create suspense might change from culture to culture,...but underneath it all, its the same story' (Seger 161). In noting this variation the audience can fully appreciate the beauty of the film's writing.  Although her cancer is a physical ailment, this brokeness is also inner due to the place she keeps it.  Luisa does not let cancer slow her down but rather she lifts herself to live life to the fullest. This transformation of the way she lives her life can inspire all people to break out of their shell and live everyday as if it were their last. The archetype present in the film also adds to the cultural phenomenon and proves Seger's theory in yet another way.  The archetypes, usually found in hero myths, are commonly present characters. Y Tu Mama Tambien does not have the typical archetype, in that it is not a character, but rather the narrator's voice who fits the archetype.  This archetype is the wise old man who provides the audience with special knowledge.  This part is essential to the success of the film. The narrator has an older, deep, calm, and soothing voice which gives the impression he is wise and intelligent.  The narrator's voice fills in all the gaps of the movie which are not said by the characters, which allows him to serve as the wise man for the audience. One example which summarizes the narrator's purpose happens during the long car trip. Suddenly the noise of the movie becomes silent for two seconds and the narrator's voice calmly comes in. The voice explains that the village they were passing was the village which Tenoch's nanny was born in.  His nanny was forced to leave the village alone at the age of thirteen to look for work because of the desperate poverty she was experiencing.  This really contrasts the two worlds present in Mexico, the rich upper class, and the marginalized poor.  Throughout the film the narrator's voice provides similar comments which opens the viewer to an entirely new insight of the often painful Mexican life. The narrator even reveals the secret of Luisa's cancer in the end. He then tells of the way she continued on with her life as balanced and full of energy. The narrator captures the essence of the film in his wise old man archetype which he beautifully fulfills. Balance in life is something that all people want, but do not necessarily seek out actively until it is too late.  Luckily for Luisa she balanced her life by simply taking a trip with two guys to a beach.  In this journey she learned life lessons of friendship, humor, compassion, pain and joy.  The movie has certain differences from the exact mold of the Healing Myth, but those minute differences do not affect the overall theory. Rather they add to the uniqueness and power of the movie. In closely following Seger's `Healing Myth', Luisa truly has been healed, maybe not from cancer, but healed from all worry and fear of the painful world, and she enjoys life as a blessing.

All other films carry the burden of nationality, and it is a heavy burden indeed. That's because films define society and `national' films attract undue expectations to define what it means to be French, or whatever. It is burden enough when the country has a healthy economy, a long history with film, and political stability. But when the country lacks any of these, each marginally competent film gets blown up to mythic proportions.So it was within a whirlwind of expectations that I viewed this as a non-Mexican North American. My own experience with Spanish-speaking literature and film is relatively slight, but from `Quixote,' through Borges, hispanics have led us all in intelligent self-reference. In the last few decades, this has merged with post-modern fabulism or `magical reality' to produce some similarly great art.But there is a backlash from the street, which promotes the frank, impulsive sexuality of hispanics. And so we have Spanish films that are about sensual caprice. And people flock to them for self-definition. I recently saw a most amazing film `Lucía y el sexo,' which to my mind was a superb blend of the two Spanish self-aware abstraction folded into a selfserving passion for sex as life. Both literary and cinematic.Now along comes this film, that doesn't make any such synthesis. It in fact sticks entirely to the `passion-for-life' side, goobered up with some political commentary and wrapped in a traditional `dying girl' wrapper. That this is deliberate can be seen in the girl leaving her writer husband, whose friends talk about intellectual things she doesn't think important. Its pleasant enough, especially the dialog, and I didn't mind watching it. But knowing that millions of Mexicans adjust their sense of self using this template is somewhat tragic.So let's emphasize what element remains of interest the narrative structure. There are three narrative stances here the one within the story, centered on the boys; the `underwater' one (presumably the placeholder for what would be the folding in a better film and presaging some new awareness in the story); and the spoken narrator. These are separated by very clever sound editing and constitute the best element of the film. All the folding is done here for instance, one road is blocked by a traffic death and later on a different road the narrator informs us that if they had been on that road tens years prior they would have seen an accident with similar social context.If you work hard, this spoken narration is sometimes clever but all in all you'd be far better off watching `Lucía y el sexo,' and celebrating hispanic passion both sensual and intellectual.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4 Has some interesting elements.

Of course, the photography is brilliant and the use of perspectives is great!But what I want to write about are the parallels between some events in the movie and the inner plot.1. The 2 friends are swimming/diving together, somehow as a symbol of their friendship. But the second time, the pool is filled with leaves - which are a symbol of decline and thats the moment when Julio confesses that he had slept with Tenoch's girlfriend. That's when it gets complicated.2. Then they are stuck - with their friendship and with the car. But that is the moment when they find the perfect beach. And that's the moment when their friendship reaches its climax - they confess everything to each other, but they are cool with it. Their friendship seems more important than ephemeral things like lust, sex or their teenage girlfriends. But the idyll of the beach is disturbed by the pigs that smut everything. And the pigs are like lust and sex - that's what destroys the relationship again and this moment. The pigs are wild and dirt everything, like the final sex scene with Luisa and the 2 boys.3. The more wild nature gets, the more wild is their experience. But back in the civilization of the city, they cant go on with that. The city represents their socialization and the society's rules (which doesn't really allow the kiss of the boys). Its way beyond their comfort zone.4. The beach is also a parallel to Tenoch. He wants to be a writer; free and on his own - but ends up studying economics. And the beach ends up as a touristy place - probably without its natural beauty.I don't know if you agree with my attempt to interpret the movie on a deeper level; but to me, the picture works perfect on so many levels.It's a very inspiring movie - dramatic and yet funny, offensive and yet subtle and witty.

I've just watched Children of Men, director Alfonso Cuarón's latest movie, and been totally blown away by it, so I thought I should catch up with his earlier works.There is a line in the film where one character says Mexico breathes with life. Well, so does this film. It's entertaining, life affirming, funny, wistful without being sentimental and features the almost unbearably cute Gael Garcia Bernal. Bernal and the excellent Diego Luna (as Julio and Tenoch) are two young men with too much time on their hands. They take off on a road trip across Mexico with an older woman Luisa (Maribel Verdu, with a body to die for) while their girlfriends are in Europe.Luisa is nursing the hurt of discovering she has an unfaithful spouse, but by the end of the film we discover she has deeper reasons for escaping from her life in Mexico City and heading to the coast with her two new young friends. The boys are trying to impress her when they tell her about their secret beach, but after traveling through the grinding poverty of Mexico's hinterland, they do actually find a place at the coast which is beautiful and unspoiled, where life is still lived with grace. But not for long, as we discover that this place too is about to be redeveloped for tourism. Along the way, Luisa seduces both boys - whose rampant sexuality dominates the film wonderfully &#150; trying to show them more adult and arguably more satisfying ways to make love.The movie is beautifully acted and perfectly filmed and edited.

(OK, not really a pizza place, but a beach paradise!)","Date":"15 March 2006","Score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama","Review":" This film by Alfonso Cuaron (co-written with his twin brother Carlos) is worth your while even though it's in Spanish and you'll have to read the subtitles (but I don't like to read, I'm brain-dead, no offense intended at those out there who are actually, officially-medically brain-dead). You may have seen some of Cuaron's other work (e.g. remake of Great Expectations w/Hawke and Paltrowich), but unlikely that you've seen him like this. The story's formula is not an unfamiliar one a coming-of-age episode involving two male friends, each of whom hankers for the same femme fatale (many have thus rightly compared it to Truffaut's classic, Jules et Jim). Julio and Tenoch (Gael Garcia Bernal & Diego Luna, respectively) are two Mexican upper-middle class teens and longstanding friends, as evinced by their getting high, reluctantly attending school and incessantly engaging in frank discussions about their sexual fantasies-cum-encounters (which become all the franker as the film progresses). They both have girlfriends, conveniently away on holiday to Italy, leaving the boys by themselves, but fret not, they've promised to behave and remain true! The leading lady in this foreign gem that you shamelessly balked at seeing because it involved reading subtitles, is as comely as can be, HOT in the most classy while still curvaceous of meanings (the former proved by the first scene in which we meet Luica (the delicious Maribel Verdu, who the non-troglodytes amongst ye might remember as the loveliest of the beguiling sisters in Trueba's Belle Epoque) in a formal cocktail dress, the latter proved no less indisputably by the balance of the film); consider also that her character is a woman ten years older than the two other protagonists and thus emblematic of an older, female teacher upon whom her younger male students bear great crushes. The film's replete with great local flavor, stellar vistas and beach scenery juxtaposed with unmistakable poverty, assorted Mexican pop and varied American fixtures, as well as an enrapturing leitmotif, further buttressed by Cuaron's use of stedi-cam shots, close-ups and practically lyrical lab dissolves. This ineluctably intoxicating film deals with sex in an up-front and explicit manner, quite unlike the way the Hollywood studios would dare depict it--Hollywood could never have made this movie, just another reason for you to see it. The film even informs the viewer of the unabashed means by which it intends to address the topic of sex, lust and passion by a sort of visceral, visual confrontational opening scene, with the camera espying two people (Julio and his girlfriend) having sex while promising their hearts to one another/none other. Louisa's character is Spanish but we find her in sunny Mexico courtesy of her marriage to Tenoch's pompous author cousin. Tenoch & Julio encounter Louisa at a wedding reception, where they hit on her for the fun of it and in an effort to irk her husband, a character the audience will immediately dismiss, and whom we will later learn we were well warranted to so hastily dislike. She responds with amusement, seemingly flattered and they talk of taking a trip to an Edenic beach, called Heaven's Mouth, in the north of the country, a fictive, extemporaneous creation of Tenoch and Julio's, described in increasing detail on the heels of each other's mendacious leads (a scenario I certainly found familiar), with the boys finally asking her to join them. A few days later, after an emotional crisis I dare not divulge, she shocks them by accepting their offer to go to the paradise that doesn't even exist, so they must borrow a car and think of somewhere that might vaguely resemble such a locale. This journey becomes the crux of the film; an odyssey of self-discovery I found most conscripting. Much as Truffaut did in the aforementioned Jules and Jim and, more recently, as Jean-Pierre Juenet (Delicatessen, City of Lost Children) does in Amelie, Cuaron employs an almost surreal, stoic narrator who periodically works on our auricular senses to complement and/or counteract the otherwise heavily/visually vibrant emotional aspects of the film. Every once in a while, the film goes silent in an almost hypnotizing way, whereupon the narrator tells us a character?s back story, some random thought or a piece of Mexico's history; one such moment comes when the narrator tells us of the horrors our heroes would have seen had they happened to have driven down this particular stretch of road five years prior, an odd fact that soon turns out to be profoundly more relevant than was immediately apparent. The journey that the boys end up taking with Luica is enlightening to say the least and, as for the film as a whole, I can say nothing more pithy and poignant than add it to your queue!

It is an example of a non-pornographic movie where explicit sexual scenes play an essential role. It is the story of a summer in the lives of two oversexed teenagers, close friends Tenoch and Julio, whose girl-friends have left for a vacation in Italy, leaving the guys behind to deal with their sexual frustrations and boredom. Their initial diversions are drugs and partying. But, in a flight of fancy and make-believe, Tenoch floats the idea to the sexy wife of a cousin, Luisa, that the three of them take a trip to a remote beach. For reasons of her own, and reasons that constitute a significant subtext of the story, Luisa surprisingly agrees, as her husband is also away. Tenoch and Julio then scramble to come up with a plan, and the three of them take to the road.The youthful enthusiasms of Tenoch and Julio propel the story to a great extent. For example, they talk about their club, the Charolastras (the astral cowboys!) that has a manifesto with eleven rules1. There is no greater honor than being a Charolastra.2. Do whatever you feel like.3. Pop beats poetry.4. Get high at least once a day.5. You shall not screw a fellow Charolastra's girl-friend.6. Whoever roots for Team-America is a faggot.7. Whacking off rules.8. Never marry a virgin.9. Same as 6.10. Truth is cool but unattainable.11. The a**hole who breaks any of the previous rules loses his title of Charolastra.If you find this kind of adolescent playfulness endearing, then you will like this movie.But, more serious topics are broached. We see a rural Mexico that few tourists probably see - there are military checkpoints (the movie takes place in the summer before the 71-year rein of one-party rule ended), poverty stricken towns, a roadblock where they are coerced to make a donation, the site of Tenoch's maid's home town, and much more. Tenoch's upper-class cosmopolitan urban existence is in stark contrast to most of what they see.In their brief trip Luisa has taught them much about life, about being a woman, and about sex. And Tenoch and Julio also make some discoveries on their own. But Luisa carries with her a sadness - a sadness that we do not fully understand until the end. It is the revelation of that sadness that teaches the greatest lesson and truly marks the end of Tenoch and Julio's adolescence.I found the beginning of the movie a bit confusing as we meet, or are told about by a narrator who makes occasional intercessions, Tenoch and Julio's families, as well as the families of their girl-friends. Interesting background information, but things don't really take off until the trio is on the road.An excellent, original, insightful, sexy, joyful, and melancholy movie.

His father is both corrupt and rich. His best friend is Julio, the son of a worker, a secretary who has been at her same job for decades. Luisa is a dental technician from Spain. She's married to an intellectual, a writer, a professor, a man of no passion. They are all on their way to Heaven's Mouth, a semi-mythical beach which the boys believe they have made up in order to lure Luisa on an outing of fun and games.At first, Julio and Tenoch strike you as being a new versions of Cheech and Chong. They're funny. They smoke dope and they fool around the pleasure principle like there's no tomorrow, no pain and no worries in contemporary Mexico or for that matter the world. The camera pans the traffic jam caused by a dead pedestrian, a poor man on his way to work, hit by a bus because he was in a hurry and didn't take the lengthy pedestrian ramp. Tenoch and Julio discuss and diss Julio's left-wing sister, who is at a demonstration, thinking that it is she and her comrades who are holding up traffic. They pass the dead man's corpse, in slow roll with the others in the snarl.'Y tu mama tambien' is like this. It takes you fast, past the wreckage, arrests and police state operations/apparatus of daily life in Mexico as people make their livings and the three make their way to Heaven's Mouth. And as much as they ignore a well rounded honesty of life, other than pleasure, eventually, revelations begin to weigh in and make the participants stop, to reflect on who they are; what they desire; who they have been and who they may be becoming. They're all naked, but not yet completely revealed. Each has secrets covering weakness and betrayal.And the sex is good too.

The beautiful older woman (Ana Lopez Mercado), teaching them about life, sex and themselves, is from Spain; the upper class boy (Diego Luna) has the Aztec name of Tenoch, and his working class best bud has the last name of Zapata (played by the riveting Gael Garcia Bernal, who was also in another terrific Mexican film Amores Perros, and is so charismatic that I kept following him with my eyes and forgetting to read the white on white subtitles to figure out what he was saying, so Spanish speakers have a real advantage).The climaxes are telegraphed in advance, coming organically out of the story, but make us re-interpret what we've seen throughout, so it's the kind of movie you want to talk about to people who have seen it.As scatological as the subtitles are, I gathered that the spoken language is even more so, as I recognized a couple of epithets that didn't get translated.The cinematography is lush and beautiful, the only indication that this is the same writer/director who did Great Expectations and The Little Princess, Alfonso Cuaron.The soundtrack songs are carefully selected to reflect specific points of Mexican influences and regional culture as they play on the radios and jukeboxes along this brilliant, revelatory journey.

As the story develops the ice gets thinner and thinner, its incapacity to carry the weight of their fantasies advances faster than their growing inevitable end stop - maturity.The Mexico of the teenagers and their generally stoned friends is one of affluence and political connectedness.  One father belongs to a country club that features one of the biggest private swimming pools I've seen - no film set here (the pool is the scene of a very, ah, unusual depiction of teen horniness).  Neither of the lads cares much about the actual political and social issues occurring during their adventures and which are seamlessly integrated into their story.  Their futures are a blank to them but a blank untroubled by the need to be concerned or ambitious.And then arrives the femme fatale, a beautiful, smart but very raunchy just-left-husband gal with whom they take off in a beaten-up old station wagon to find, ostensibly, a secret beach.  Of course what the guys have in mind is seduction.Without a polemical discourse the viewer is carried into the isolation and poverty of much of Mexico as asphalt yields to hard dirt roads leading to barely navigable sand traps.  The people they encounter along the way are realized subtly but effectively.These teens aren't really so likable but they do show occasional promise of growing up, a redeeming feature.  This is less a road film than it is a comedy of (very bad) manners. The director and three leading characters have taken raunch to a new and interesting cinematic plane.While these kids may be a parent's nightmare, they become more complex, and inevitably more insightful, as the film develops.  By the end they are very, very different people and in danger of becoming sort of plain vanilla post-teens (whatever the Mexican equivalent of the Japanese salaryman is, they may well be launched along that path).This film is rated R but many will wonder how it avoided an X. Be forewarned.  But some of the sex scenes are hilarious - especially if the viewer has ever been a teenager. )Cuaron uses voiceovers not so much to explain the story but to quietly show that all lives have sidebar events beyond the tale being told, events that can be described in one or two sentences and which illuminate the fullness of a character's journey.The scenery is gorgeous.Definitely a different and engrossing story.

In the midst of that already considerable achievement, director Alfonso Cuaron has managed to weave in perspective of Mexico's class system on at least three different levels.I have been surprised to read numerous reviews where the film's construction is made into a binary rich (meaning the road-tripping teen-aged friends Julio and Tenoch, and their travel companion Luisa) versus poor (those they meet along the way, peddlers on the road, fishermen on the beach).  That comparison is certainly present, but I would argue that the conflict between the worlds of lower-middle-class Julio and very wealthy Tenoch is the central tension in the film.  Cuaron handles this in a deft and heartbreaking manner where we see Julio slighted time and again, but in subtle ways Tenoch's girlfriend gets no problem from her parents if she wants to hang out with him late night, but Julio is constantly chaperoned with his girlfriend; the voice-over that occasionally dots the film informs us incidentally of Tenoch's past hesitancy to use the bathroom at Julio's place; then there's a repeated swimming race which takes on metaphorical weight as Julio tries continually to catch up to Tenoch.  Finally, an incredible scene takes place between the boys as they have a coffee after their journey of self-discovery (not a spoiler, don't worry).  They are about to go to college, Tenoch to University and Julio to community college. Tenoch has a Tower Records bag next to him, the sign of his ability to consumer products freely, but Julio insists on paying, a sign of his self-consciousness.  The body language of Julio as he asks for the check is unforgettable.When would you ever have this kind of class undercurrent flowing in a coming-of-age teen story made in Hollywood? The kids in American Pie, as well as its flip side American Beauty, are basically from indistinguishably similar neighborhoods and classes; the issue doesn't come up.  1985's Breakfast Club comes to mind, but class issues there are fodder for confessional-speak, not for fleshing out real-life situations. Just the fact that Julio's sister in Y tu mama is a political activist and we actually see her in a demonstration adds more dimension to this film's characters than most teeny boppers are getting in their current ninety minutes of thin character sketches.  It's exhilarating to see a film like Y tu mama but simultaneously depressing--Cuaron has made a great film, but left the States to go back home and get it done.

In 2010, it's daring subject matter doesn't mean as much socially or personally. It's just not as daring as it might have been a decade ago, though in Latin America it will still surprise a lot of viewers, who are still dealing with issues of homosexuality outside of the celebrity and gay counterculture spheres. That is, this movie is about sexuality, very openly, among exceedingly normal people.Some points.1) It has a casual filming style, with jittery camera, ambient light, and location shoots.2) The actors (two very young men and a slightly older woman) are as unrehearsed as possible, at least in appearances.3) It's a road trip movie that doesn't romanticize or create theatrical drama. Instead it makes it seem like it really could be, or really was, a road trip just as shown.4) If you take it literally, you might be bored. You might wonder why these somewhat ordinary people on a very ordinary day have to offer that is worth the two hours of screen time. (I say somewhat ordinary because the three are all beautiful people and are not at all ordinary. This is really a fault, conceptually, but a reality for most filmmakers trying to draw an audience.)5) A voice-over will interrupt the flow of the characters on their trip in a highly affected way (even the background sounds and the dialog are muted). This allows the film to give us information that might not be available otherwise.6) It all matters because of the end. What happens in the last couple scenes begins at first to seem predictable, almost too delayed given the length of their trip and the obvious sexual needs of all three of them. But then it twists, and it's the twist that matters (and the twist that might not have the punch it once did).I had trouble getting absorbed. I watched it with a native Spanish speaking woman who was much more taken with the mise-en-scene created by the ordinary Mexican landscape and interiors and even by the banter in the car. I was busy reading subtitles (there is a lot to read). But beyond that, I think if you want something to happen you will mostly be impatient or bored. If you can get into an unidealized road trip and just learn something about the characters you might find it a special, sincere movie. All the unfancy filming and realistic acting and script have the big purpose of making the final turns in the movie convincing, and convincing to an ordinary viewer. That's key. The sexual content, which includes some very uncensored material (two men masturbating on diving boards, nothing hidden, for example), is meant to be the sexual reality of the common viewer. So that homosexuality, or even the hint of it, becomes simply an acceptable alternative, or something that exists and has to be grappled with, or is to be found within, large or small.That makes the movie important. It might not pull it off perfectly, but it does have an edge and a depth matters.

It's a mystery on whether it even exists. What take's the boys by surprise is when Luisa accepts their offer and they have to make some quick arrangements. On the trip through rural Mexico the boys tells stories of their sex lives and become more and more interested in Luisa, who is depressed about her live. On their trip they see poverty that rural Mexicans suffer, the changes to the nations and their own friendship is tested.The film is classified as a comedy. I personally see it as a drama with some comedic elements. It is a tale of friendship which also acts as a social commentary about the youth of Mexican and the social elites (they suffer the same issues as anyone else). It also shows wider themes about Mexican life and the issues facing the nation.The winning features of the film are the performances and the direction. Bernal, Luna and Verdu are fine actors, ending up doing other excellent films after Y Tu Mama Tambien. Cuaron is a man who gets the best out of his actors; just look at some of his other films to see this. All free actors make you believe in their characters and have tough roles to play. You end up caring for the character, a tough job because Julio and Tenoch are not very likable.Alfonso Cuaron is one of the best directors around at the moment, making the best of the Harry Potter films and the excellent Children of Men. He has such a great approach to this film, allowing the camera to follow the characters and action, using tracking shots and focusing in and out. He rarely cuts, which is refreshing in today's climate. The action feels more natural and the takes a Kubrickian approach. Cuaron makes you interested in to fairly unlikeable character.

It really shocked me how much the Mexican style of life resembles that of my country. What also shocked me is the fact that i was really experiencing some kind deja vu watching these two guys. It was like i was watching i film about me and my friends, only in Spanish. The funny thing is that the language is the only difference because the mentality, the way of talking, the dreams and hopes they have, are the same. I especially liked Julio because he somehow looks and lives the same way i do. So this film really stroke a chord on me (i'm not sure if that's the exact meaning of the expression).I was so repelled watching Kids for example, but somehow Julio and Tenoch seemed so innocent to me, even when they were masturbating by the pool. As I've already said the Mexican mentality somehow seems so close to me and i never really knew this before i watched this film.

It was a very original film, unlike anything I have seen before; although I will not pretend to have watched an awful lot. I found many interesting comments, none of which really captured the essence of this story. Yes, it is a story of teenage hormones and immature hyper-sexuality. However, above all I was struck by the way the lives of the characters were perfectly blended in the social conditions of Mexico. I am almost ignorant to the reality of those conditions, but this film shows a great sensitivity to a reality not wanting to become a dominant theme. It is a background -a reality background that is not often accomplished without trying to make a statement. It shows a writer and director who is very sensitive to social conditions and the way they effect simple people. I was particularly moved by the scene were their car is over-taken by the police who then stop by-passers at gun-point. The three of them went on, not giving any attention, as if nothing happened; as if this sort of thing is an every-day sight; death and politics, interwoven with desire, life and sexuality, throughout.As for the sex, the explicitness is never raw; It is alive with the dynamics of teenage explosion, the guiding element of female sexual desire and freedom.I have to say, I was particularly disappointed by the viewer who seems to only want to reinforce the stereotypes of Western, American or otherwise 'politically stable' back-grounded films. I am a Greek viewer and identified the 'different', the 'other' -it is a Mexican film. However, I did not find it loaded with 'political' or 'nationalist' attitudes and stereotypes. This would be a very superficial viewing.All and all, watching this film is a definite boost to your senses and minds.

The first boy, Tenoch, is the son of a politician in the upper class, while the second boy, Julio, is from the middle class and has an activist for a sister (seen in the window of their car is an anarchy symbol). With both of their girlfriends on vacation the boys take drugs and think about getting laid all day in the summer, until they meet Luisa. They invite Luisa to join them on a trip to Heaven's Mouth, a beach that they made up on the spot. On the way to a beach which doesn't yet exist, the boys' hormones get between them, and causes conflict between the three. Their trip teaches the boys much about what their friendship is and was, and who they really are. The woman serves as their mentor as she lives up her new found freedom from her husband, who she left before her decision to go with them. Y Tu Mama Tambien uses parts of Mexican culture to serve as metaphors for its characters' trek. An omniscient narrator comes in at different points and comments on the landscape and the people around them, showing metaphors for their struggles. Like the boys, the county is still trying to find its identity. The movie even shows this, when the boys go to a political protest to find Julio's sister, and also when they suspect a traffic back-up to be the cause of one. They see the poverty and corruption of Mexico (police and former police used to be thought to be thought to be responsible for 60% of Mexico City's crime), while also the good sides of the culture are shown. The boys are festive and the people of the country are friendly. These two sides are shown at once while the boys joke about the corruptness of Tenoch's father before finishing a bottle of Tequila. Although I have not been to Mexico City, from what I know about Mexico and the short time I have spent there, I believe this films depictions of it are accurate. This movie is not a Mexican version of Porky's or American Pie, as some critics like to compare it to. While the movie does feature teenage sex and drug use, these aspects are included because they define the characters. While funny, Y Tu Mama Tambien also should not be considered primarily a comedy. Their lifestyle is not joked at but rather portrayed accurately. While many people do not consider this as a typical lifestyle, many teenage boys seek sex and drugs above all else, as Tenoch and Julio did. The film's purpose is not to be funny but to portray the realizations of the characters on their trip.Y Tu Mama Tambien feels like a documentary in watching, in part from the omniscient narrations describing the country but also from the excellent acting of Diego Luna (Tenoch) and Gael Garcia Bernal (Julio). The cinematography also adds to this, in a pleasant way. The plot seemed to lose momentum about two-thirds of the way briefly through although regained it for a good finish. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind. "},{"Title":"Las Espanolas - what do they represent?

Check out some of the stuff coming out of Chile if you get a chance - especially Sexo Con Amor. Heres some ideas from someone who studies Mexican history and a bit of film criticism.What do people think of the significance of Ana, la Espanola? I find it a motif in the two most successful recent Mexican films (Amores Perros being the other) that it is a beautiful woman idolised by Mexican males who plays the tragic heroine. Ana's marriage collapses and the film concludes by revealing to the viewer that her make-every-minute-count attitude towards life - the essence of the mexicanidad represented by the boys - is born out of her imminent death due to cancer. Likewise, Goya Toledo's stunning model Valeria is the victim of the car crash around which Amores Perros' three plots weave their narrative. Instead of death she lives to lament her misfortune as a crippled shadow of her former self. I sympathised most with the actresses playing the role of the foreigner, the european, over the Mexican actresses who suffered loss, because in the brutality of a Mexican society dominated by machismo they saw their beauty taken, they became fucked by the harsh reality of life. This recalled the theme of La Chingada (the fucked/violated one) in Mexican history. She is La Malinche - the conquistador Hernan Cortes' lover and translator, who facilitated the conquest of the ancient Aztec civilization for the colonising Spanish troops. To this day 'La Chingada' remains an insult in Mexican spanish - hijo de la chingada, 'son of the f**ked one' or 'son of a bitch', and 'chinga tu madre' - 'motherf**ker' remain some of the vilest insults in mexican street slang.what does this history lesson have to do with film you ask? well, my theory is that in these films, the directors are subverting the nationality of La Chingada - the f**ked one is la espanola in each case, not the mexican women as it the time of the conquest - and in doing so reclaiming a mexican identity through the medium of film. The Spanish women are 'conquered' by Mexican men, and live in Mexico migrating from their homeland. Their destiny is tragic, as is that of the Aztec civiliztion following the Spanish invasion. In each film, they become La Chingada figure.As well as subverting nationality to reclaim identity for the Mexicans, the narrative surrounding las espanolas highlights problems blighting Mexican society. The global invasion of materialistic consumer culture is documented by Valeria. Indeed it is exactly because she is the beautiful model that her injury in the car crash seems so tragic. Until the tragic revelation of Ana's cancer adds extra significance to her character, it appears as if marital infidelity is the tragic element, revealing the breakdown of the traditional family unit in the Catholic conservative Mexican society. Furthermore, it rises as almost a side issue yet the liberation of Ana allows Julio and Tenoch to discover their homosexual side, an issue still largely taboo in the world of teenage Mexican men.What do other people think about the roles of Ana and Valeria? Am I reading too much into them?

But as I read the comments on this board, I'm struck by how surface and shallow most people perceive this film to be.  Consider this additional perspectiveThis movie, for me, is one of the greatest films ever in its exploration of sexual politics.  And I don't just mean sexual politics in the literal, personal sense (between and among Julio, Tenoch and Luisa), but sexual politics in the metaphorical sense, with the three characters basically paralleling in personal terms the larger (and cataclysmic) political drama unfolding in Mexico at the time, where the ruling party, after 71 YEARS of continuous (and taken-for-granted) power, was finally voted out.  This political backdrop is referred to in the voiceover, but I think non-Mexicans tend to not understand the huge import of that event on the country.  And here comes a moviemaker very pointedly setting his coming-of-age tale within that huge political drama.  I don't think the movie should be short-changed by ignoring that political backdrop.  Consider what Tenoch, the privileged, spoiled rich kid of the ruling (but about to be non-ruling) upper class, represents.  Consider what Julio, his comfortable and upwardly-striving middle class friend, represents.  Consider the friction between the two and what they say to each other in those moments of friction and anger.  And consider what happens to them when Luisa, a perceptive third-party outsider (from imperial Spain even!), gets thrown into their mix.  What does she represent?  Just a sexual conquest?  Hardly.This is one of the most perceptive movies I have seen in ages, both in terms of the personal and the political, both layers running side by side with equal energy.  I loved these three characters as human beings, and I also loved every layer that they represent beneath the surface.

However, it's the relationship between the boys that is really at the heart of the film. The film's attitude to them is ambivalent the occasional scene hints at their boorishness, and a strange, deadpan commentary, draws attention to their relatively privileged status in impoverished Mexico; but essentially the portrait is sympathetic, even a celebration of teenage exuberance and naiveté. Ultimately, however, to me the whole film seemed more like a preface to another movie that would have begun where it ended, in that the events have only a retrospective significance to the characters, but the structure of the movie allows no room for nostalgia until the very end. Still, director Alfonso Cuaron appears to be a major talent this might not be a great movie, but he will surely make one in future.

As the days progress, the boys' relationship with Luisa develops and they soon find themselves entangled in a lecherous love triangle. An intoxicating fusion of sex, friendship, politics and death, Y Tu Mama Tambien is a mix of sober realism with carefree fun. While an omniscient voice narrates the past present and future of seemingly meaningless background events, the boys continue their trip, oblivious to all but their own libidos. Although skilfully executed through voice overs, the political statement doesn't quite cement with the main storyline as intended. An interesting watch, if you are patient enough to handle the slow moving storyline but it does feel like Alfonso Cuaron is trying a bit too hard to be arty and missing out on simple clarity. After opening into an explicit sex scene, you're bombarded with names and background information and spend the next few scenes trying to work out who's who, when it really doesn't matter. Well worth a watch though, if only for the exceptionally well written characters. The boys are especially believable and development of Luisa's character from fragile tag-along to free spirit is well-paced. Good&#133; nothing special but worth watching nonetheless.

After they meet Luisa (the Spanish wife of Tenoch's cousin), they invite her to a trip to the beach (a fictional one) and she declines the offer at first, but when she receives life- changing news, Tenoch and Julio are forced to improvise everything for the journey along with her.Cuarón goes beyond the typical road movie and offers a luscious portrait of a Mexico marked by overwhelming social contrasts, as seen in Tenoch and Julio's friendship, the former son of a prominent politician with a turbulent past, and the latter, son of a working- class single mother, and also seen in the many places visited by them during their unusual trip (a country filled with poverty and misery, but with a strange vitality and beauty). At the same time, it's a seductive and fervid vision about sexuality, with a verve and naturalness closer to the French Nouvelle Vague, unafraid to question double standards that still prevail when it comes to sex and masculinity, especially in a society like the Mexican one.A movie of such nature requires the right actors, committed to this fearless task. And Cuarón chose wisely with Luna and Bernal to play Tenoch and Julio, for they've been friends in real life since their days as child actors in Mexican TV and their chemistry is indeed remarkable. But the movie's revelation is Maribel Verdú (already famous in Spain before this movie), who finds in Luisa the perfect opportunity to show her acting skills as a vulnerable woman, ready to leave the pain behind and enjoy life in every way.One can say Y tu mama tambien is a curious mix of coming of age movie + road tip + raunchy teen comedy, but the result is nothing like any of those. It just happens to be an invigorating creation from a master of storytelling.

I first looked at this film as a coming-of-age film, albeit one that happened to include sex scenes much more graphic than others of its genre. That opinion helps me find a reflective starting point for this film, but every time I watch it, I think more and more about the socioeconomic points Cuarón interjects throughout. I think more about how little I know about other countries, especially the one just south of my own. (I suppose Tenoch and Julio don't know that much either.)

Don't let the porn film description fool you, it's one of the most thoughtful movies on adolescence you'll ever find.Few movies give me the feeling I get when watching Y Tu Mama Tambien, something indescribable I get when watching Hal Ashby movies or any kind of movie with the ability to leave a viewer profoundly touched. The natural camera-work and ambiance is something really hard to find, it's usually found in Lars Von Trier's earlier work, or Dogme 95 movies in general, yet the cinematography in this film is undoubtedly much better and easier on the eyes.In a way, Y Tu Mama Tambien could be seen as a polar opposite movie to Children of Men, while they're both movies with themes about sex, one sees it as fun and the other sees it as a necessity. The characters in this film are only doing it for pleasure, it's what they want the most and probably the only thing they think about, it's a journey about finding ourselves and the things that make us human.I also love the narration, it makes the movie feel a lot more intimate than it already is from the opening scene (when we see one of our main protagonist's having sex with his girlfriend) by letting us know personal details of every single character. It's hard to make a sex scene easy to watch and even funny, it's usually shots of legs and some other body parts, but here we see our characters from an original point of view. It looks awkward, its never what they want it to be, which is one of the aspects that makes the film so unique.It's not only a good film, it gets much better when revisited, the characters feel like good people to hang around with, making it what I'd say is my favorite hangout movie.I'd recommend it to anyone who liked movies similar to The Kids are All Right, The Descendants, Dazed and Confused, Rudo y Cursi, Jules et Jim, Harold and Maude, and/or Boogie Nights. Go see it if you haven't already, it's one of the best Mexico has to offer (and my personal favorite).*spoiler alert* By the way, in the last scene, the narrator lets us know that the two best friends will never speak to each other ever again.

It is one of those which whilst you are watching it you are unsure what to think, and when it finishes you feel completely overwhelmed by what you have just seen. All of this and the film isn't really about anything on the surface and doesn't have any major scenes to get you on the edge of your seat. It is simply a film with fantastically written and acted characters that you care about and want to follow on their journey, which is the brilliance with this film. The plot is fairly simple. Two Mexican teenage lads lose their girlfriends to the travelling bug, however as soon as the other halves disappear across the World the two begin partying and searching for that next sexual encounter. At a wedding, to which they both attend, they meet Tenoch's (Luna) cousin's wife. Hr name is Luisa (Verdu), she is ten years older and way out of their league. However they both work their charm and invite her to a make believe beach the following day.The lads little fib doesn't pay off as when she realises that her husband has been sleeping with random women she takes them up on the offer, sending the three of them across the country in search of a make believe beach. Whilst on this trip tension between the friends builds as both try to sexually conquer a woman much older than them. She again calls their bluff and begins to flirt back and before you know it she is pitting them against each other. Many times through the film we see Luisa alone and upset, clearly hurt at her recent issues, but we don't fully understand this until the end when her big secret is revealed and we can see why she is like she is. It ends up being quite moving.Like I said the film is very bare on the surface but the depths are endless. For one it shows us the contrasts within certain areas of Mexico at the time of filming. This is also highlighted by narration which is spoken over a muted backing track every time the trio move to a different area. The narrator explains to us the dangers of where they are heading or the turmoil the area has been through. As well as the narration we see this in our leading characters. Tenoch is a member of a wealthy family and has mainly been brought up by the maid. This is in contrast to Julio's (Bernal) very middle class family, who seem nonexistent in his life. In Luisa we see a woman who had potential which was extinguished due to an ill aunty she had to care for. Technically she is an orphan and had to go out to find the first job she could. Each of their contrasts are shown throughout the characters and it all means something to each of their lives.Sex is also a massive theme in the movie. The opening shot is of one of the boys having sex with his girlfriend, and the second is of the other lad trying to have sex with his girlfriend before her Mother comes up the stairs. This is their life, and by the end of the film their sexual encounter is brought to a whole new level in a shocking final act which ultimately changes both their lives.So much is good about this film. It is very relatable for every man and woman at the ages and with the problems of the characters. It is all believable, from the characters, to the language, to the motivations. Even the camera work is as if you are there with them in the moment. Everything about it is drawing you in and despite the lack of anything really exciting happening you are constantly hooked.I had heard of this film before I watched it and whilst settling down to give it a view I was a little dubious but by the end I was shocked, I was moved and I was willing to watch more of these characters. Alfonso Cuaron used this film to gain the big productions in Hollywood and I'm really not surprised it worked as this film is fascinating. 4 / 5For more reviews www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com "},{"Title":"Very interesting and sincere film.","Date":"26 July 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama","Review":" Generally I dislike Latin American cinema and culture in general. They are, I believe, inferior to European and American ones.This film is an absolute exception and just because of this I write this review. Some people accept it as a teen age film, others--as a comedy. But this film is neither. True, it is about teenagers but the point of view,I think, is unmistakably adult and mature. It may start as a comedy, but as the plot develops, it becomes painfully clear that definitely comedy it is not. The greatest merit of the film is putting the problem of freedom to the central stage. Nobody dares do that nowadays and those who have, have done it clumsily and unsuccessfully. These two boys--they want to be fully,absolutely free as most young people want to. And their trip to the sea is in fact their travel to absolute freedom, the fulfilling of their (and many others') dream, the much seductive ( but ultimately very dangerous) idea of breaking EVERY taboo and restriction. I think the most beautiful moment of the film is the final scene the talk in the café, the moment of balance. Yes, they have had their enjoyment of total freedom but they had to pay the heavy price for it--their friendship. Also, all the time they (and we,the viewers) believed that they were using the woman when it becomes clear that in fact she has used them to a much greater extent. It is very easy to start a film interestingly and convincingly but it is much, much difficult to END it interestingly and convincingly. And this film manages this!!! Many things that happen in the film are deceptive and the viewer is forced to rethink many of his/her reactions and emotions as the film progresses and becomes more and more complex. The pace is perfect--neither too slow, nor too quick.I think few films have achieved such a degree of realism and sincerity. Only very talented people could make such a film!

Luisa stays behind as she has finally found herself after a pretty dull life with her husband (or so we think!) What makes this movie stand out are the performances from the three leads. Maribel Verdu as I have said is stunning. She gives Luisa such dimension from being vulnerable, sad and reflective and to then be seductive and sexy as hell. Wow what a woman. Diego Luna and Gael Garcia Bernal are best friends in real life I believe and it shows in their performance which is true and honest. The final scene for me was a real kick in the teeth. It is set a year later as the boys have drifted apart and bump into each other and decide to go for coffee. It turns out Luisa died of cancer just a month after the trip and knew all along she was ill. Tenoch (Luna) leaves and the narrator tells us they never meet again. It ends as Gael Garcia Bernals character sits and thinks for a while (about Luisa?) looks like he is going to cry then comes around and asks for the cheque. I've got to admit it was a sucker punch. The movie is littered with moments that upon finishing watching become important, the sense of death all around (the accident on the road at the beginning & the story of the deaths on the road 10 years before) of life fading away of history and how we all fit into our small time on earth. Luisa at the doctors taking the survey on if she thinks in terms of the present rather than the past or the future. Luisa telling her husband on the phone she met a 98 year old woman who remembered her whole life still and the stories she could tell, her non reply when a Mexican lady says she is natural with children and that she should have her own. This is one great movie. However if you are offended by sex and sex talk stay away. 10/10 "},{"Title":"Just Dive In","Date":"8 January 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama","Review":" Even masterworks can have warts. Y Tu Mama Tambien, widely praised, honored, and loved by the independent film crowd, of which I count myself a member, has a few.The storyline is straightforward. Julio and Tenoch, the pampered, selfish, jive-talking teen-aged sons of privileged Mexican parents, encounter Luisa, a pretty Spanish wife who loves too much and knows her needs too little. Suddenly and inexplicably betrayed by her husband, Luisa accepts the boys' half-serious invitation to drive to a secluded beach named Heaven's Mouth, near Puerto Escondido. The road trip provides the three with the chance to grow and share their lives, to build their trust, and to come to know the Mexican people, who are portrayed as bedrock betrayed by an oppressive oligarchy and political elite &#x96;- by remote political and business leaders just like Julio and Tenoch's parents, and Luisa's husband, in fact.The trip has its magical and pagan qualities. Earth mother Luisa seduces each of the boys in turn. Each boy admits in turn to sleeping with the other's girlfriend. The action pauses from time to time so that, like water babies, the boys, shot from below, can swim naked in a pool &#x96;- sometimes clear, sometimes strewn with nature's leaves. Poor Mexicans bestow gifts, like religious offerings, on the well-to-do travelers. Miraculously, Heaven's Mouth, whose name one of the boys made up, turns out to exist, and it is gorgeous. A peasant, who later emerges from the surf with fish for supper, leads the travelers to it. Pigs overrun the trio's campsite like modern-day locusts forcing the trio to adjourn to a local cantina where they party all night and take an oath to debauchery, also known as Diving into the Surf of Life. And so on.Whether in or out of their clothing, Maribel Verdu (Luisa), and to a lesser extent Gael Garcia Bernal (Julio) and Diego Luna (Tenoch), act with a range extending from comedy to pathos. Bravado, playfulness, wonder, anxiety, reserve, lust, disappointment, and rage, among other attitudes, spill out of them believably and in rapid succession.And the warts? Frankly, the extreme youthfulness of the boys early on is hard to take for anyone over 16. There are too many shots in which Luisa looks directly, beckoningly into the camera. The irony of rich and poor is heavy-handed throughout. The camera often drifts away from the action to follow poor Mexicans as they work, get smashed by a car, or are pulled over by the cops. An omniscient narrator glosses many scenes by describing what happened at the same spot ten years earlier or what will happen two years in the future. Each account is meant to, and does in fact, act as a damper on the drama.And the final twist, which will not be disclosed here, emerges without the basic foreshadowing they teach in creative writing class, even in Latin America, without which there is nothing left to do than to bring up the credits and go home. Some surf indeed, but it is too much.

In 2008, Tim Robbins, Rachel McAdams and Michael Peña took a trip across the country in The Lucky Ones. In 2006, a family took a trip to Redondo Beach, California for a beauty pageant in Little Miss Sunshine. And in 2002, Gael García Bernal and Diego Luna hooked a beautiful older woman in Y tu mamá también. Each film has its own reason for the road trip, but they all feature the same basic prospect all individuals stuck in the car find out a little bit more about themselves along the way. In the case of this film, the characters learn much more than a little; in fact, they learn quite a lot about themselves and about each other. I won't go into too much detail as to what exactly each person learns (because that would give so much of the movie away), but just be in for a lot of information coming at you at once. The acting is very good, especially from Maribel Verdú, portraying the woman that both boys fantasize after. I had a couple of problems with the film. Firstly, it tends to stretch on and on, and although it leads up to a very good finalé, I just think that it took a little too long to get there. Secondly, there happens to be random dialogue about the areas surrounding the car-going travelers, which helps to set the stage and the state of the country as a whole, but in the course of things, tends to distract the viewer from the actual story at hand. But aside from that, it's a very well-made film. One review I've read calls it a comment on economics and sexuality, which is very close to being correct. If you aren't partial to rampant amounts of sexual escapades, this definitely isn't for you. Any of the characters could find themselves in some sort of sexual encounter at any time, so be prepared for that as well. On the whole, a solid film that's worth a watch if you don't mind the sexuality of it all.

I have got to say that the trip part was my favorite, while they go and go inside the car and learn a lot about themselves, or also while they stay in the hotel and they realize about some things they have never looked upon on, and in the end, when they finally arrive to Boca del Cielo and finish the great adventure. The final scene is one of the greatest.

I can imagine this being shown and overly analyzed and dissected in video and TV arts classes.But without those cerebrally constrained enconiums and analyses, Y TU MAMA is best appreciated for Cuaron's sense of artistic and conservative minimalism. You'll notice how he uses semi, or directly hand-held shots and extremely long takes. This is you know a director is diligent enough in planning, blocking and framing his scenes - even with a mediocre and so-so plot such as that of this film. I saw that style of Cuaron's, hand-held long takes in CHILDREN OF MEN as well.But where this is, I liked his work in GREAT EXPECTATIONS better, it was more artistic, (not to say I don't love his hand-held minimalistic approach), and had a better story.

There were also other cheesy looking movies that had pictures of nearly-naked women, and I kept thinking to myself that I probably should not do a presentation on any of those. After browsing around enough, I came across Y tu mama tambien and decided to rent it.  I am very glad I did, as it helped open my eyes (and improve my Spanish comprehension) ... I watched it without subtitles (as there were none provided and my television decided it did not want to give me English subtitles, which is OK) and will admit I missed a lot the first time around.

I then went to IMDB and read all the posts about this movie and have come to understand how profound the meaning(s) of the movie really is/are.

Why I waited so long, I don't know.American filmmakers expend tremendous energy, dreaming up coming of age tales that center around the external, working-world-like concerns their young protagonists must face.  In the end, they are often just writing forced metaphors for the sexual awakening that ushers a young person into the social world of adults.  When AMERICAN PIE came out, it was hailed for its honesty and its likeable characters.  It's such a telling example of what is wrong with American cinema that the fim's rating came down to how many thrusts Jason Biggs was allowed to give a pie.Doubtless, some American viewers will either find MAMA too prurient to contain any value, or they will be so uncomfortable as to laugh at all the wrong times. But Cuaron has made a film in which we are encouraged to laugh, to hold our breaths in anticipation, to feel the blows to the gut of betrayal and to remember our own most painful experiences of sexual awakening.  This is the story of two young men who are full of hormones and lust; they create and idealize rules of behavior for themselves that they cannot possibly satisfy.It is also the story of Luisa, an older though not much wiser woman, who takes a journey through rural Mexico and sexual maturation with them.  Her intentions are questionable, and even when we learn that she sought to affirm her own sense of life, we wonder if she was careless in the way she went about it.  The film will not answer this question for us, which by itself would earn it the kiss of death from American censors.  Luisa is the catalyst throughout the story, and it is only at the end that we become aware of her own journey as well.  Maribel Verdu's frank, playful and layered performance is likewise the glue that keeps the story on track.Cuaron makes an important documentary about rural Mexico in between the lines of his trio's road trip.  The voice-over narration is critical for American viewers to understand the subtext; and for some reason, Mexican directors can pull off this conceit that feels like a cop-out in american movies (as in COMO AGUA PARA CHOCOLATE). As with the story of the three protagonists, this documentary is not judgmental, but it raises difficult questions and demands consideration.What surprised me most, an hour after the film had concluded, was that I found myself in tears as the ramifications of the film's events pieced themselves together in my mind.  My actual sexual experiences may not have mirrored those of the characters, but I and many of my generation have been down the road where the mysticism, power and necessity of intimacy are painfully defined through trial and error.  More than anything else, Cuaron captures not just the honesty of this journey, but the hard truths that result from it.  And yet, the truths I took away were the ones I knew already, as I am sure they will be for each individual viewer.Viewers who are offended by sexual behavior we are all told is wrong will miss out on the beauty of this film, but I do not recommend it to them. Instead, I reserve my high recommendation for those who can understand that sex is part of life, and of growing up - and who can appreciate fine filmmaking that does not sidestep that great truth.  Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN joins my very short list of 10/10 ratings.

There were a few moments of confusion before I came to the realisation that he simply could not let me in.  Very embarrassed, I walked home and didn't get to see it for a whole year (when it finally came out on DVD).Anyway, I recoment it to anyone who's not offended by very, very graphic sex scenes.

I have enjoyed it. The teenagers are talking about girls, sex and drugs and I believe them. It is not like in American Pie - that was a Hollywood film made for the modish wave young people are having their first kickoff. American Pie is a comedy about the life of teenagers, but Y tu mamá tambien is a life comedy of teenagers. So do not compare these titles only because of language.

On the way, the cinematography and setting offer a view of Mexico's strange blend of crudity and indomitable vitality.  Through dialogue which permeates the film, the characters tell both their histories and their current situations.  The emotional and sexual ground that is covered is sometimes amusing and sometimes offensive, but always lively.  The characters tell the secrets and live the dreams that will die without any expression in the lives of many.  The acting is not incredible but is exactly what it should be.  The simple plot allows for complex and shifting relationships between the characters through their activities and conversations.  The film's climax is predictable but nonetheless provocative, while the conclusion is in keeping with the reality which grounds the characters' dreams throughout the movie.  Despite the whimsical journey, all three characters are repeatedly brought to back to the fact that their actions have consequences; if their trip is a flight of fancy, then the conversations are occasional crash-landings into cold, hard real life.  Its narration and events are so true to el ritmo acelerado de la vida (the pace of life) that the movie leaves the viewer nostalgic for those events in the characters' past.

Tennoch belongs to the Mexican upper class; his father is a rich succesful businessman. Julio's origin is the Mexican middle class. Both live in Mexico City. On their trip they get to know the lifestyle of the poor Mexican lower classes, like fishers and farmers. At a beach a poor fisher's family invites the two guys and the Lady to spend some time in its house even though there is not enough money to buy enough food for the children. The hospitality and the helpfulness of these Latin-American lower classes are enormous. Next this movie deals with the topic friendship and Mexican macho culture. At a bar Tennoch, Julio and Ana get very drunk and they tell each other their deepest secrets. Tennoch admits to have had sexual contact with his best friend's girlfriend. The next day Tennoch regrets having told his friend that because Julio is very disappointed and angry. Their trust in each other and even their friendship is in danger to get lost. This is a profoundly moving scene. The growing tension, the disappointment and all the emotions of the two friends can be felt. Mortality is also a very hot topic of this movie. Ana, who is married with Tennoch's cousin, does not mind to commit adultery with the two teenage boys. All she wants is to have fun. She tries to enjoy every minute of her life as much as possible because she knows not to live very long anymore because of her illness, cancer at the final stage. Ana has the right opinion towards her illness. She does not feel sorry for herself, more or less she tries to gain the maximum of her remaining days. The movie `Y tu mamá también', written byAlfonso Cuarón, outlines life, friendship, mortality and social class systems in a very humorous way. Anyhow the messages delivered to the audience are not that funny. Although the movie is a little bit overacted nearly everyone can see his life reflected in it. Everybody has to face disappointments and broken friendships. Furthermore the film encourages people to enjoy their lives. Live every day of your life as if it was your last day! Nobody knows what will happen tomorrow! Especially for learners of Spanish this is a very recommendable film. The dialogues are spoken in Spanish and subtitled in any other language, like English or German. For children under sixteen this movie is not recommendable, because of some erotic scenes and some scene involving the use of drugs.

Not because he was going to give away any plot spoilers (he never does that for any movie unless someone asks, and I made sure not to) but when I asked him what the movie was like, he said it was not just a sex romp but an insightful drama with great writing. He thought it was a great movie.Having just seen it, I'm in complete agreement with him. There is a lot of explicit sex in Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN, but it's not gratuitous or glamorous or inexplicable. The sex and particularly the nudity in this film is woven with considerable finesse into the story that the director, writers and actors really wanted to tell--the story of modern-day Mexico, where the events of Julio, Tenoch, and Luisa aren't overshadowed by the political upheaval and economic earthquakes rumbling through their country, but instead mirror them.The master stroke device in this movie's narrative comes each time the audio suddenly fades to total silence, and allows the narrator to comment on events such as a tragic death or the bittersweet history of Tenoch's nanny. What makes this technique so brilliant is that (to my recollection) it is not applied to anything that the main characters say, except for a crucial fight between Julio and Tenoch. They are the narrators of their own action and only at the end does the narrator look outside them to provide commentary that is incredibly sad but also touching. Not many movies go from very good to outstanding in the final 5 minutes but Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN does.The standout performance here is by Maribel Verdu. The movie works because of her character, her sad history, her understated intelligence (she doesn't think she's as smart as the movie shows her to be) and her rainbow of emotions in dealing with these two horny, unformed, goofy but somehow-likable kids. If she wants a starring career in Hollywood, my guess is it won't take her long to get one.The only weaknesses I can point to are some speechifying that hammer home the film's unabashedly left-wing political views--which are otherwise presented in less-haranguing human terms--and a ridiculous narration that tries to tie this material to 23 pigs (you'll see what I mean!).

(See Amoresperros for another recent example, also starring the amazing, hunky, snacky Gabriel Garcia Bernal). Things are never what they seem as we follow two very horny friends (Bernal and the equally yummy Diego Luna) as they are lured by Luna's sexy older female cousin on a road trip into the poor heart of Mexico -- and into a journey of self-discovery that plays out with erotic heat that builds to a stunning climax and one of the sexiest kisses ever captured on film.Obliquely, Y tu mamá también deals with many issues, including sexual politics, macho culture, friendship, class warfare, being true to your heart vs. following the herd, and mortality. Along the way, we're treated to a journey that is both loftily literary and basally sexual. Kind of like life itself. The aftermath is neither clean nor pretty, but some motives are revealed and we're left longing for the things that might have been.Above all, Y tu mamá también is about life and what it means to really live. It makes me look forward to more works from the new Mexican cinema, and particularly from director Alfonso Cuarón.

They go off in search of the elusive `Heaven's Mouth' beach and their friendship disintegrates as each of the friends has a sexual encounter with the cousin who just happens to be fleeing a cheating husband, and this leads the friends to reveal secrets about their prior infidelity.

Its thematic depth and power are incredible and inspiring.I rented the DVD of the film without a great amount of expectation, but found myself absorbed in the story and utterly touched at its conclusion.To dismiss the sexual nature of the film as pornographic is as ignorant as it is blind.  The sex in the film may be excessive to some, but pornographic implies a sense of emptiness and exploitation.  Y yu mama tambien is as far from empty as a film can be, and its characters are never once exploited.Equally unsettling are the dismissals of the two lead male characters as oversexed, Porky's-esque teens.  To observe the growth of a character we must first see from what stage that growth occurred, and to what extent. And as a 19-year old male, I can guarantee that such behavior is not exactly uncommon among my age group; its representation here is indeed realistic.Y tu mama tambien is as much of a journey for its audience as for its characters, a journey during which seemingly countless themes are woven together into an indescribably gorgeous Mexican tapestry.What thematic threads complete this tapestry?  Well, sex, of course.  And maturity.  And the end of innocence.  And death.  And class-difference. And love.  And friendship.  And living.  And politics, change, betrayal, healing, discovery, self-knowledge, etc etc etc etc.It is about life.  Perhaps my age and my own impending end of innocence is what struck me so powerfully about the film and caused it to haunt my thoughts for days and days after my first viewing.For all the Harry Potter fans up in arms about the fact that Alfonso Cuaron is directing Prisoner of Azkaban and complain that it will be some kind of kiddie-orgy, please do a little research first.  This is not Mr. Cuaron's only film, and seeing as he directed A Little Princess, it would appear that such hasty conclusions are without merit.Please, if you are thinking about seeing Y tu mama tambien, do it.  Wait not a moment longer and prepare to enter a story that, if you possess an open mind, will take you to such beautiful and painful places as you may have never experienced.  Hopefully, it will move you as much as it did me.

A troubled older woman allows herself to be seduced when all three of them look to escape Mexico City for different reasons. A heavily multilayered story, the oppression and rage that they attempt to escape consumes the many that they leave behind.The boys manage to convince a beautiful older woman to travel with them to a legendary beach of paradise. The woman initially rebuffs the boys, but upon an event, which the audience learns of much later, she agrees. Jealously erupts over her lustful attentions and the once unified front of the two boys is ruptured to expose the individual character of each.The smoldering older woman Luisa (Maribel Verdu) is seduced and subsequently becomes the seducer of the young men. Schooling the young men in the sexual arts this is probably the most sexually daring film I've ever seen. In this application, sex is used as a tool with which the audience pries back the overlying veneer of each character to expose the virulent emotions and underlying motivations below.While I found this to be a film of great depth and personal exploration a less writerly viewer might find the seemingly simple chain of events unsatisfying. Once again, an audience's willing participation in the writing of events and analysis of the character provide the basis for its subsequent success or failure.

I'm reading the posts for this flick and wonder how many viewers are actually Mexicanos and how many just rented it because they heard rumors about its sensuality and couldn't see it in the theatre because middle America doesn't show art films as much as other cultured parts of the States? This was perhaps the most realistic portrayal of adolescence in the life of a latino. Sure sex was a large part of the story but what teenage guy (much less a latino) could argue it isn't as large or larger part of their own life. If you haven't even been to Mexico, the rural parts not yet Americanized, I don't see how you could even really relate to this story other than male fantasy fare - unless you've toured your own country living out of a VW. For those who don't understand Espanol, you'll want to watch the movie at least once more just to pay closer attention to the dialogue and even then it doesn't come close to exactly what is being said in Espanol.

I think it is precisely the poignancy of the sort of people it captures that makes it work. Maybe it's an obvious point that privilege does not give you freedom from the pains/vulnerability of erotic encounters, or from the inevitability of death. As someone else commented here, the film is remarkably well structured and delivered in terms of the narrative structure. When the narrator shares little anecdotal details about Tenoch and Julio, as well as the stories surrounding them, all sound ceases, save for the voice of the narrator. It has the effect of pulling you in and out of the film, and testing the bounds of cinematic reality. Diego Luna and Gael Garcia Bernal convey all the zeal, hormonal intensity and naivetee of adolescence.The film also links eroticism with death. There is the suggestion that we have an intimacy to both in our lives. We can't really escape either. We are born, we make love and we die. Everything else is contingent and these are the sure things. This is especially so when you play it back in your mind and think of their little gestures of love towards each other - everything from the mundane bits of not mentioning what they don't like about each other's habits, to jerking off by the poolside in rhythm to their delightful sexual fantasies. However, everything passes and things do not last permanently.There is this sense throughout their road trip, that the randomness of death strikes elsewhere - the nameless, faceless statistics of the working class, the impoverished, the indigenous of Mexico. But all the while, it is absolutely, intimately connected to the three of them. It is not so much Ana's relationship to Tenoch and Julio, or her imminent death that is the real issue. She knows all the while, what is going and she is aware of her imminent passing. It is the relationship between the Julio and Tenoch that is really striking. It's so solid, but so transient. What/who dies such a quiet, unnamed death at the end of the film isn't Ana or all those other people we hear about from the narrator. It is the relationship between the two after their momentary crossing of the intimacy boundary. That's what really hits in the end. Nothing really lasts and death isn't just about the physical or material. It is very much about the emotional. This isn't to suggest that the film seemed nihilistic. The fact that it so blatantly confirms this sense of the inevitability of death (despite all the intimacy, all the screwing around and the love, the bonds we forge) is somehow grounding. That seems to be the paradox of the whole film.

Maribel Verdu gives a great performance as a woman who escapes and frees her life by traveling with them to an uncertain beach location.

The dialogue was simple and boring. There was nothing about this that had any redeeming value.The only thing worse than the movie itself was seeing the same personalities exhibited by the cast in some of the extra features showing them as themselves which was as bad off as the characters in the movie.

You know, unknown actors, shaky camera, improvised script, teen sex, drugs, and set in a foreign location with lots of dialect plus make it in Spanish!

It relies on shock value. Mind you the sex scenes aren't bad, and if it had a few more with more close up it would be a half decent erotic movie to show on late night cable.It's the sort of thing you get as BBC drama now and then, and it usually wins some minor award at the Golden Sundance Festival, but I guess in a year or two it will find its way into the bargain bins at Blockbuster.Maybe I'm not the target audience, or maybe I prefer cult movies to come out of the blue, rather than the tortilla factory.

Two 17-year-old stoners, Tenoch (Diego Luna), the son of a wealthy politician and his less affluent best friend Julio (Gael Garcia Bernal), plan a summer brimming with sexual misadventures after their girlfriends go on a European vacation.  At first, the best the two friends can muster is a bout of poolside masturbation, but they hit the jackpot after meeting Luisa (Maribel Verdu), a captivating twenty-something woman, unhappily married to Tenoch's cousin. Tenoch and Julio quickly concoct a plan to entice Luisa to join them on a long road trip in a borrowed car by promising her an idyllic stay on a non-existent beach which they name Heaven's Mouth. At first charmed by, but wary of her suitors advances, Luisa finally agrees to accompany the two teens on their journey after she learns of her husband's infidelity while he was away on business.  Over the next few intense days, Luisa takes solace and ultimately finds liberation in the libidinous attention her young companions focus upon her. They in turn discover many bittersweet truths about one another.Using the often treacherous back roads of Mexico as a metaphor for self-discovery, director Cuaron has fashioned a sensual character piece that is powered by the uninhibited performances of its three leads. Also, a restless energy is created by the constantly prowling, hand-held camerawork by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. Definitely a cinematic journey worth taking, Y Tu Mama Tambien is a hot, hilarious, yet heartbreaking meditation on the limitations of friendship, trust and love.

I've seen many people who left the cinema after the first 30 minutes. But what did they expect? A Romantic comedy? A Drama? An erotic movie? Hey, it's all of those things... and even more. The movie tells the story of two teenagers which spend their days with smoking pot, drinking, talking about sex and masturbating (while their girl-friends spend their holidays in Europe). At a party, they meet the beautiful Luisa, a woman in her mid-twenties who gets betrayed by her husband. She is not able to handle this situation and leaves Mexico City with the two boys, just because she wants to escape from her problems. Together they search a mystical beach, the 'Boca del Cielo'...As you can see, the story is quite simple and nothing that will surprise you. I've read some reviews which compared 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' to movies as 'American Pie' and 'Road Trip'. People who say that must have seen a different movie. The main difference which uplifts this movie above all these dumb US teen flicks is the fact that it feels REAL. Sure, Julio and Tenoch spend most of their day with consuming all kinds of drugs and talking about sex. But here it works The actors don't seem just to PLAY the characters, the dialogue most of the time feels improvised, the camera-work is more like in a documentary film than in a feature film. Just look at one of the first scene on their trip to the Boce del Cielo While one of the actors is the car driving along a curvy road, the camera rotates around the car, watches Julio and Tenoch (the driver) how they explain their personal 'Manifesto' which defines their lives to Luisa. They drink, laugh, poke around etc. There is not a single cut for some minutes and no truck that pulls the actor's car. This is a perfect example how a great script and a beautiful filming technique can be combined to give you a unique scene. This authenticity is the main reason why this movie touches so many people, makes them laugh and -at a later point- cry.There are many other episodes in this movie which are beautiful as well, but I don't want to give too much away.

The acting from all three leads is superb, with the lead female Luisa offering the maturity of her character to temper the youthful lust of the two male leads, Tenoch and Julio. The director intertwines the themes of sex and death in an interesting way, with much social comment on the poverty in Mexico and the corrupt politicians (Tenochs father is a powerful member of the government).This is a highly sexed film, with much explicit language, and this is a blessed relief from the often restrained language of Hollywood fare. As the three characters travel together across the Mexican landscapes Luisa ends up showing the young men just how little they really know about sex, each other and the world in general.  The ending is a dark twist to proceedings but brings together all the themes nicely.If you want to see an intelligent movie, with some superb acting and a novel take on the road movie, get hold of a copy.

But I think that the main attraction for the Western audience is, as the English will put it, its 'exoticism'. As a person coming from outside the English world, I know that the Westerners will never be able to really feel and vibrate to the colours, textures and realities of the 'outer' world. And where this film is very successful is to breeze the viewer into such a world, taking him on a wing and making him think that he can smell and feel that reality.

Here's a movie about real-life characters whose deepest motivation is the lure and excitement of sex. (Powerful driving, penetrating sex.) It seems like a superficial movie at times, but it builds and builds until it reaches a wild and then sad climax. The writer-director certainly trains his camera on two boys in full heat and on a beautiful tragic heroine, making this one of the most interesting trios in film history.The narration sound track is certainly a put-off. Stoping all background sound to listen to him just doesn't work at all. And it seems as if the narrator has to tell us several involved stories each time his voice is heard, as if competing for a screen writing course.But, forget about the narrator. The film sparkles with color and characters and glimpses of rural Mexico. It can offend the normal viewing audience with its cheers to blow jobs and intercourse and all other matters sexual, but this celebration, especially in a memorable encounter at a beach restaurant near the end of film, stands out as one of the most remarkable scenes in film history.All told, an engaging and charming and erotic adventure that despite some flaws stands out as one of this new century's best.

A film that contained a thoughtful and mature treatment of even one of the above elements would make it a good film. That Y Tu Mama Tambien does justice to all of them makes it a truly outstanding film, perhaps the best film to come out of Mexico in quite a while.The film features two boys about 17 years old, Tenoch (Diego Luna) and Julio (Gael Garcia Bernal, from another great Mexican film Amores Perros). They are best of friends, even though Tenoch comes from a rich, upper class family and Julio comes from a family that can barely be considered as middle class. And as typical of many boys their age (irrespective of nationality), they are directionless and, above all, extremely horny. Their girlfriends leave for Italy on a vacation and at a party thrown by Tenoch's father (who's a respectable politician), the boys meet a sexy and older distant cousin of Tenoch, Luisa (Maribel Verdu). During their flirtatious conversation with Luisa they suggest that she should come with them and get away to a magical beach called Heaven's Mouth (which they made up just to flirt and make conversation with her). Some time afterwards, Luisa calls the boys and asks them if the invitation is still open. They say Yes. And after borrowing a car from Julio's sister for five days, the three are off on a roadtrip to find Heaven's Mouth.I will not reveal any more of the plot here, since this film contains some big surprises, particularly concerning the reason why Luisa decides to go with the boys to that made-up beach (which she believes is real). Suffice it to say that along their journey Luisa ends up teaching the boys about sex, love, and life--in short, the boys' journey to Heaven's Mouth is at the same time their journey towards maturity and manhood.You've probably heard about the pretty explicit sexual content of this film and might have been either (i) Dissuaded from seeing it, or (ii) since you like smutty and gratuitous sex in movies, you plan on seeing it. If you belong in the latter category, I can say that your expectations will be sorely disappointed. The sex scenes in Y Tu Mama Tambien are not gratuitous, nor are they smutty and puerile; rather, they're open and honest, thoughtful and mature. If you're looking for smut, look elsewhere. If you belong in the former category, I can say that you might very well be pleasantly surprised surprised about this film's frankness about sex, yes, but even more surprised about its warmth and humanity.In the end, Y Tu Mama Tambien is a film filled more with sadness--and the sober reminder of the mortality of us all--than sex. It is one of those great films that start out making you snicker and laugh (e.g. about its humor and sexuality, of which there are plenty), only to sneak up on you and shatter you emotionally by its (deadly serious) end. Although the aesthetically incompetent folks at the MPAA didn't give this film a rating, I will give it one four stars. Y Tu Mama Tambien is one of the must see films of this year--or any year.

Nor is this so one-dimensional a story as it might at first seem. Though his manner is oblique, Cuarón deftly grounds his characters' small-scale joys and sorrows in an incisively observed larger world. Y Tu Mamá También's wealthy young protagonists are both liberated and shielded by their position in life, drifting idly through a landscape that for others threatens much more serious consequences.

This deliciously atmospheric and erotic film takes the conventions of the road movie (one of my favourite genres but one which has increasingly found itself at a dead end;see such dismal fare as Road Trip for evidence of that) and plays up the subtexts. For example, this is one of the rare cases where the car is not a vacuum, the viewer is given short anecdotes by the narrator about fatal crashes or border crossings that end in death and through the windows of the car we see a dead body and the police stopping people for questioning.   As filled with death imagery as it is with life this is a film which isn't afraid of the shadows, realising that this makes the sun even brighter.  Like the Mexican Day of the Dead it celebrates life and death as well as the complexities of human nature and desire. This is an astonishingly good film; intelligent, compelling, superbly acted and best of all it lingers in the mind.

I was delighted by this charming movie, and might even go and see it again.Every scene drips with colour, and the cinematography is utterly beautiful. Mexico city and the desert drive to Heaven's Mouth are shot in long, flowing, low-down camera angles which take in the beauty of the country. All this is set off against the scatalogical ramblings of the three main characters.The movie is sometimes overwhelmingly joyous, sometimes awfully sad, but always compelling. It reminded me of the movie Betty Blue, which treats themes of sex and childishness quite similarly.A very graphic film in every sense, Y Tu Mama Tambien features frequent scenes of sex and nudity, and the language is often coarse and blunt. However, the characters are so utterly charming that the effect is never repellant.A wonderful, lively, attractive film featuring superb performances. A must-see.

The authenticity of the friendship between the main characters can only be attributed to unrelenting direction. And ultimately it acts as the catalyst for a much larger story. At points you'll laugh hysterically but not in a Caddy Shack way. There are political messages dropped throughout the narrative in a voice over that is both reserved and poignant. A few hand held shots last a few seconds too long but other than that there is no reason not to see this movie.

It's a clever and intelligent buddy/road trip film that really captures the spirit of carefree youth left to their own devices. Diego Luna and Gael Garcia Bernal play off each other as if they had been friends since childhood and really honestly seem torn when a girl (Maribel Verdu) comes between them.Since we've already received a shame on you letter for being involved (read giving out passes&#133;that's it!) with this film, I think it is fair to go ahead and say this film is pretty graphic by American standards. There is full frontal nudity on all three main characters and there's a couple of other random naked people as well. There's drinking, drugs, and plenty of sex. While not done in a Porky's style or in any disrespectful way, there is a large portion of people (conservative) that will find this offensive. There are a few gross scenes, but they all come out in a humorous fashion, not intending to be graphic for the sake of being graphic.While quite a change of pace from the director of A Little Princess and Great Expectations (Alfonso Cuaron), this narrative tale examines a time in the life of two boys and how little they knew or cared about the world at the time. This is an interesting angle to the buddy movie angle because it looks back on the time rather than being a slice of life kind of film. Its critique of Mexican culture and society are interesting to see through the eyes of younger people, who are apparently often trying to escape their heritage.  It also focuses on the perception of how deep friendships really go. Are we as close to our friends as we think?This one is definitely worth checking out if you're an open-minded viewer. First of all, you have to not mind the subtitles, second of all you have to get past the Puritan-based shame of seeing naked bodies, and third you must appreciate independent cinema. Nothing blows up, nobody's a hero, and there's no stars to speak of. So if that's all OK with you, go enjoy this film and celebrate the fact that Crossroads isn't the buddy movie of the year.

US audiences might not fully appreciate the shock factor this film bears for Latin american theater-goers, but it is in its own right, like Amores Perros, a landmark in mexican cinema. One of that film's strongest performers, Gael Garcia, is back for the role of Julio Zapata, a teenage middle-class kid growing up in the suburbs of Mexico city, contrasted with his best friend (Diego Luna) Tenoch Iturbide. the names of the main characters in themselves are percursors of the controversy around the film, named after Mexican revolutionaries of those names. The two friends embark on an adventure where they discover life, sex, thier culture and society, death, morality and ultimately as a result of this voyage, themselves. The more mature audiences might be quick to judge this film as a promiscous teen flick, but it is truly a film about self discovery and individuality. Two virtues often neglected by the more rigid Latin american societies. Not to say the shock factor is too-often pushed to the limit to a near disgusting level for more serious audiences, it is backed, however, by the social point its authors want to make.Beyond the strong social and moral content of the film, its directing and editing should be praised, using beatuiful photography and a unique style of narration from the protagonist's perspective presumably some years after the events. This communion between form and content seems to be a recurring theme the new school of mexican film is developing.However it falls victim to many of the vices of the mexican film industry especially evident in the older (novela-style) actors, and some forced performances by some of the younger supporting cast.Overall it is a great effort that is well-worth your time and consideration, particularly when seeking to understand latin american  society and youth illustrated through the lives of Julio and Tenoch.

The boys one day go to a political party thrown by Tenoch's dad a corrupt politician there the boys meet the beautiful Luisa, who is the wife of Tenoch's cousin Jano...  They go crazy for her and invite her to go to Heaven's Mouth, a fictional beach they invent.A couple of days past and Luisa phones them wondering if she can still go, the 3 of them jump into Julio's mothers beat up station wagon and off they go to Heaven's Mouth. On their way Tenoch and Julio talk about sex and tell jokes to Luisa.  They ask Luisa when she had her first sexual experience and other things related to sex.  There are scenes in this movie that had me thinking after I watch it, one scene is when Tenoch and Julio try to sneak a peak at her when they think she is undressing, the only thing they see is Luisa crying her eyes out a great scene. There are others like that.  Luisa, who we believe left her husband for being unfaithful really leaves him to find her independence we find out in the end why she left.  The movie is about being young and sexual and free spirited in a crazy world to sum it up.  I love the way they show sexuality in this movie it is at its most honest.

I'm glad to say it's his best in my opinion. The script paints an accurate picture of mexican youths and on top of that also looks into more commonly treated subjects, focusing particularly in the sadly enormous abyss between the rich and the poor in our country.The movie goes beyond any other before it in terms of sexual explicitness, but if you ask me it stops short of anything distasteful, and anyway it was about time we had some real love making in Mexican films, people might think we don't know how to ...In my opinion, either the two lead actors were high all the time, or they gave one of the best performances I've seen in a long time. They even make Marivel Verdu's occassional mishaps stand out. The photography is excellent, and you can see Cuaron pulling out every last bit of acting effort out of the cast.The dialogues are very casual and well crafted, the characters kept saying exactly what I would've said 10 years ago when I was their age, it was a rejuvenating experience that took me back to that most careless of ages and had me wishing I had also taken a gorgeous older woman to a deserted beach.(Spolier coming...although someone already mentioned it here) I saw the gay scene coming from about halfway through the movie, and I think it practically ruins the commercial success of this film in Mexico because of the way homosexuality is seen here. But Cuaron was brave enough to keep it, and to have it signal a crucial and enduring change that finishes the story in quite an unusual way. The actors were also brave to do it, they know they risk multiple derogaroty comments and could affect thier career in some ways (probably not in a significant way though, they are great actors no matter what).I hope international audiences are once again attracted to Mexican film-making, like with Amores Perros last year. It's my personal opinion that the problem with Mexican directors is that they are so terrificaly creative and unorthodox that they aim too high sometimes.

'Y Tu Mama Tambien' is one of my favourite road-trip movies, but to call it just a road-trip movie would really be an understatement; not only is it a thrilling journey of sexual exploration, but also a nuanced exploration of some of the most pressing socio-economic issues of our time. The narrator gives us interesting character histories, and intriguing but haunting societal insights which make the story quite gripping, and makes Mexico a character as well. Other than that, as critic Roger Ebert says, 'it (the movie) is about the fragility of life and the finality of death.' And the film is funny as hell; its humour is quite well-placed. It takes the genre of teen sex-comedy to completely new heights.Class-division really plays an important role in establishing relationships; even in the best of friendships, there's always a deep-seated impact it has. No matter how close we are to someone, we always keep a few things secret. A free-spirited road-trip cum sexual adventure boils down to a night where true feelings and pinions come out in the open; things are never the same after that.The three lead actors, Gael Garcia Bernal, Maribel Verdu and Diego Luna, are really talented, and given riveting performances. Other than the three characters and Mexico, we invisibly become a part of their journey and their lives. The cinematography is spectacular, and captures Mexico with such elegance. The one-shot scene towards the end, in the bar, which starts with conversation and ends with a dance, is quite a remarkable sequence. The passionate kiss which comes after this scene is sensual and memorable.The film is quite observant, doesn't compromise anywhere with its storytelling, and doesn't take any moralistic stance on any aspect; that's what makes the film so gripping and compelling.

It's a coming of age story. It's a warning about income inequality, and it's an encouragement to live life to the fullest.This is a remarkable film. It's hugely entertaining, heartfelt, considered, beautiful, and thoughtful film. Two graduating high-school students, one the son of privilege (Diego Luna as Tenoch) and the other from a lower-middle class background (Gael Garcia Bernal) take a road-trip to the mythical beach of Boca del Cielo which they invented in order to impress the estranged wife (Maribel Vertu as Luisa) of Tenoch's cousin Jano. Being 18 year olds, they are full of swagger and bravado but can't anticipate what will happen and this makes for the drama of the roadtrip. They see Mexico and we see it beautifully, as filmed by Emmanuel Lubezki. It's often seen from inside a car as the group heads southwest toward the coast and we seen the dry, brown Mexican landscape often in shade. Lubezki uses extended shots, lingering over the dry, sleepy landscape. As they drive, they stop in different places and Lubezki captures the locals in their everyday lives. We see regular people selling trinkets, driving buses, herding animals. The dignity of regular people is honored as we see their lives doing their jobs. We hear about social conditions in the area through some very interesting voiceovers. They are interesting because they serve as a counterpoint to the privilege of Tenoch, Julio, and Luisa. We hear about the life of Tenoch's maid. We hear about the life of itinerant fishermen, and we hear about the lives of people struggling through the desert to get to the United States. Many times voiceovers aren't particularly helpful, but in this movie they really add a lot of depth and heart to the movie. I can't think of a film in which voiceovers were used as well as in this one.The boys are immature but can also be very funny. Writer Alfonso Cuaron and his co-writer, his brother Carlos Cuaron, get the tone of 18 year old boys just right - boastful, over-the- top, overconfident. This is their first mistake. All sorts of betrayals and miscommunication lead to tension and fights. The boys fall out and make up. They bond and they bicker. There are awkward moments and moments of resolution. This movie is so much more than a coming-of-age movie. It's so much more than a sex romp. It is not just social critique either. It's beautiful cinematically also, but it's more than just a valentine to Mexico. It shows that movies can charm us with their beauty and humor and joy but also make points about justice and struggle and yet everything can go down easily. It's a movie you can go back to again and again. "},{"Title":"Cuarón Revisited","Date":"9 June 2012","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama","Review":" When Alfonso Cuarón made his first feature, Sólo con tu pareja, he was considered one of the hopefuls who would revive Mexican cinema's past glories, but the chances for developing film projects are few in Latin American countries, and some of their best filmmakers have gone Hollywood, including Cuarón. After doing new versions of The Little Princess and Great Expectations, he went back to Mexico and made Y tu mamá también, a film that proved he was among the best talents working in world cinema. In his Mexican films he has always worked with his brother Carlos, with whom he co-wrote both his first film and this fragmentary, good film that has different levels of interpretation. First it can be seen as a common sex-crazed youth comedy, but it belongs more appropriately to the anti-genre mode, as Robert Altman's caustic O.C. & Stiggs. Both films use elements from that sub-genre to comment on the status quo, class relations, sexual politics, warring ideologies and ecology. Y tu mamá también goes beyond that, thanks to a narrator who makes comments about everything Mexican and human, making it a universal reflection on existence. Also, the movie confronts moral values and iconography when it deals with sex, showing what most films suppress or sublimate, especially when they enter homo-erotic terrain. While lesbian scenes are commonplace in mainstream cinema, Cuarón does not fall into the trap of many filmmakers who cannot hide their homophobia or personal fears when they have to show two men's intimacy. Second, it also works as a rite de passage psychological melodrama, and as a film about gender confusion, which has been a fashionable topic for too long now. Wisely it does not capitalize on it as other films have done, turning themselves into campaigns to promote sexual ambiguity. In these times, there seem to be more confused or ambiguous people than certified homosexuals or lesbians, and young people have become natural targets of campaigns that benefit from this mess. The truth hits the two male leads, Julio (Gael García Bernal) and Tenoch (Diego Luna), when they find themselves engaged in sex with Luisa, a foreign lady (Maribel Verdú) and with each other and, as in everyday life, they have to face the truth about humans' rich, complex and sometimes dark sexual nature, which sometimes brings break-ups, death or sorrow. But my favorite and most attractive level is a third one, in which I see its story as a metaphor of the predatory work done by the national and international agents of globalization in the so-called underdeveloped countries. This reading may be more meaningful to a Latin American, but the elements are there to consider its validity. The three main characters are introduced within their social, ideological and economic frames. The boy from upper middle class (Julio) who follow orders to keep up with the rich and powerful; the rich boy (Tenoch) who will follow the work of his elders, and the foreign lady (Luisa) whose initial attraction to the New World kids later becomes disdain, imposition of her rules and control over their bodies and souls. For some Luisa is the most endearing character I find her rapacious and two-faced, often hiding her motivations. My appreciation of this character is not motivated by xenophobia or misogyny it is simply based on direct observation of many international agents (male or female) working in Latin America. The three meet in the overblown wedding of a bourgeois couple, with the Mexican President as a guest of honor. Then they make a trip through the Mexican landscape where they witness the inner culture that market economy erodes in most countries. The cultural devastation finds barriers in countries with strong millenarian cultures, as Mexico. In this scenario, it's not a surprise that Tenoch decides to study economics, that Luisa is a Spaniard who is rotten inside (it does not matter if she is out of scene in the end, more agents will come to follow her work), and that Julio has not yet found a way to subsist in this ever-changing situation, with middle class in impoverishing conditions, due to ruthless economic measures taken by governments and international financing agencies. When the three engage in sexual rites, they have a striking effect on them. Sex &#x96;as suggested by Pasolini, Reich or De Sade&#x96; has a corrosive effect on bad consciousness. What the Cuarón brothers show is what is happening outside the minds and illusory, comfortable and acclimatized environments of the rich and famous, and their sycophants in the middle sectors. The Cuaróns are brave enough to show it without palliatives. Bravo! 10/10.

Gael García Bernal is fairly familiar in this country (for his involvement in other foreign language hits rather than big budget English language extravaganzas); Diego Luna is about to become familiar in his own right with his involvement in the Sean Penn vehicle Milk. The central, combustible and testosterone-overdosed performance of this duo needed a strong woman to leaven it and Maribel Verdú is quite excellent. She provides a idiosyncratic character, sober but capricious, sexually arresting but charming not aggressively feminine. I was reminded of Romane Bohringer's enigmatic nymph from Gilles Mimouni's L'Apprtement (although Verdú is a better actor).Cuarón's film doesn't conceal itself.

A touching coming-of-age road story (but this time in Mexico rather than the US) follows two horny teenage friends and an attractive woman as they search for (and serendipitously find) Heaven's Mouth, the idyllic beach of dreams that is empty, open, and a realm of passion.Their story is backed up by a subplot of national instability. Politics and class dissolution follow them everywhere, but like the teenagers they are they are only caught up in their own ideals, the world of sex, friendship, and the wonderful ability to not care actually care for truth. The woman who follows them craves that freedom, but is also pulled by the allure of remembrance for her lost lover from an age gone by, and the three strike a pretty stunning relationship with the wide, colorful Mexican landscape.Director Alfonso Cuaron is not only good at directing action but sustaining drama through long takes of emotional imbalance. This movie's editing focuses the narration very well on the actual movements through space of the characters in ways that preordains the showy later cinematography of Children of Men--this time, though, it's for dramatic effect rather than action. And dramatic it is.I can't say I like the hand-held cinematography that much. Hand-held cinematography is a very hard effect to pull off well and in this one it was sometimes more distracting than it should have been. Cuaron definitely knows how to use it, and it's good to see that over the years he's getting more comfortable with the technique. He should already be considered a great director, but if he keeps up his improvement I won't even have to argue the point.--PolarisDiB "}{"Title":"A very moving portrait of wasted youth and ruined innocence","Date":"23 December 2006","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama","Review":" Y tu mama tambien, like a lot of the films from the new generation of artsy Mexican directors (Inarritu, Almodovar), is seemingly unpretentious. At its surface, it's a short movie about two young teenage boys who take a road trip through the countryside of Mexico with an older and more experienced woman. Up to this point, the two boys have spent most of their days dallying in drugs, alcohol, one-minute sex and, occasionally, longing-filled masturbation. Their innocence and naiveté is charming enough, but in the company of a relative-by-marriage named Luisa, the boys realize they have a lot to learn. Their friendship is tested by their shared desire for this woman, and, less obviously, by their curdled and misspoken feelings toward each other.A lot of critics and fans praise this movie because it is unafraid to show sex. True, many of the scenes are graphic and even have a the ironic flavor of bad porn. But people who can't get over the sex are missing the point--and believe me, that's tough to say as a seventeen year-old male. The point of the movie can be summed up in one of Luisa's lines near the film's end--Life is like the surf, so give yourself away to the sea. As the trio travels through dirt-poor sections of Mexico, they collide with disturbing vignettes of death and disaster--the side of Mexico that these three rarely see. Drugs, sex, partying aside--all that these very confused people are trying to do is enjoy the small slices of life they've been doled. And aren't we all?

Actually, it's a brilliant piece of film-making.The performances of Diego Luna and Gael Garcia Bernal are magnificent. They're young actors obviously without a lot of experience, but the richness they give to their characters really makes the viewer believe that their friendship operates on multiple levels--something the normal road-trip buddy movie rarely does. A lesser movie would have focused on how each of them react to the influence of Luisa. Wisely, however, the Cuarons have chosen instead to focus on how they react to each other as a result of her presence. That's far and away the more interesting story--and why this film is riveting.The addition of the narrator was, in my view, inspired. Narrators are rarely seen in movies these days, but the narration in this film is perfectly balanced--the narrator is healthily detached from the action, but chooses to illuminate interesting details about the relationship of Tenoch and Julio, stressing the things they will not tell each other--and the narration makes the viewer a participant in the action rather than merely an observer. The characters undergo a pretty radical emotional transformation over the course of their adventures, but even at that the narrator finds time to tell us ironic anecdotes that illuminate modern problems in Mexico, such as the man who's killed on the bridge early in the movie. As a result the whole thing comes off brilliantly as a kind of subtle social satire, but even if you don't care about that element it's still fascinating to watch.This is also a beautifully made film. I wonder how many casual viewers notice that the scene at the beachside bar, leading up to the infamous climax of the film, is done all in one fluid take. I also wonder how many notice the increasing entropy of the visions presented on the screen at the beginning we see the well-ordered, colorful, upper-crust environs of Tenoch's family's house, and at the end we're cavorting around in squalid rural inns where clucking chickens shamble through the guest rooms and pigs run wild across the beach. The final scene of the film couldn't be more perfect. The plot device revealed in this scene is a little contrived, but at least it doesn't come totally out of the blue. Yet the characters' reactions--again more to each other than to the situation--are completely believable.

Cuaron knows exactly how to get his point across (what I think is a largely negative outlook on the future of the country, but an outlook nonetheless), and does so by masking Y Tu Mama as a coming-of-age road trip. But this is not necessarily a coming-of-age story, not for Tenoch and Julio. It is a commentary on the time period, a time when Vincente Fox's win ended a 70+ year long rule of a government that, for lack of a better word, sucked--as well as an analysis and possible interpretation of human will, motivation, meaning, etc.. Definitely worth buying on DVD. One of the best modern foreign films made.Things to pay attention to, both technical and thematic1) the framing of certain figures and their location on the screen (e.g. the corners, the middle, and so forth), and the choice of shots and angles, for instance, when Luisa talks to her husband for the last time in the phone booth.2) the narration, the narration, and the narration....NOTHING should be chocked up as unnecessary....Cuaron is an experienced, well-educated filmmaker. Why would he direct a sloppy script? A bunch of reviews mentioned the trivial scenes with the pigs, and the chickens, but they are in fact there for many reasons (and if nothing else, they give us a glimpse of the real Mexico)and 3) the parallels between and representations of the three central characters.

He immerses his frames with lurid conversations and sexually explicit attachments. The scenario opens with Tenuch(Diego Luna) a wealthy teenager and his less well-off pal Julio(Gael Garcia Bernal of Amores Perros) flirting brazenly with the seemingly demure Luisa (Belle Epoque's Maribel Verdu) at an elaborate party held on the enormous grounds of Tenuch's father. The fact that the attractive, more mature woman is married to Tenuch's older cousin, does little to discourage the youths' hormonal inquiries. The two buddies, fueled with inebriated courage, extend  an invitation for Luisa to join them on a trip to an invented beach paradise they instantly name Heaven's Mouth. Part of their steadfast playfulness with the woman is supported , no doubt, by the likely prospect of being entirely dismissed. Eventually the three do hit the open road together and immediately share an uncommon ease with one another. The forthright, spontaneous talk flows ceaselessly between them.(Possible spoiler) When Luisa seduces Tenuch at a roadside motel, the young man's false bravado quickly dissipates. He responds indecisively to the older woman's sensual commands. Is Luisa introducing the boy to the adult pleasures of sex or attempting to induce her own liberation? Luisa's awakened sensuality mixes mysteriously and enticingly with a deep-rooted, perceptible sadness. (Possible spoiler) Julio witnesses their heated session and mean-spiritedly discloses to his life-long friend that he slept with his girlfriend. This shift in the psycho-sexual dynamics of the 'triangle' and the consequences that occur, recalls Truffaut's Jules and Jim. One may also cite the mercurial films of Federico Fellini and Pedro Almodovar as cinematic reference points. Y Tu Mama Tambien shares the youthful impertinence and carnal obsessiveness of Fellini's cinema and the sex-saturated humor and unblinking openness of Almodovar's work. Curon uses an omniscient narrator who provides backstory, context, philosophical observations and future revelations in a calm, matter-of-fact tone. We're tipped off to the insightful information and commentary whenever the soundtrack eases into a forewarning silence. Curon closely examines themes of freedom, class, loyalty, and the nature of truth. What makes Y tu Mama Tambien such a distinctive film is that it's much more than a coming-of-age comic road movie. It's also a fascinating exploration of sexual awakening and a bittersweet tale of lust, loss, and irretrievable innocence. As the film nears it's conclusion, the boys' leering machismo and carefree outlook, contrast tellingly with Luisa's more knowing desires. She's lived long enough to acknowledge the precarious nature of life and she senses that the boys' pervasive spirit and uninhibited ways will eventually fade with time. Y Tu Mama Tambien is an exuberant and adventurous work of 'pure cinema', reminiscent of the ambitious, sexually-candid, highly personal art films of 1960's European cinema. We can only hope for more unflinching and challenging films from Alfonso Curon and his contemporaries. The film industry needs it.

Plenty has been written about the sex, some has been written about it being `another road movie` - both of which is valid - there`s loads of both. However - the sex is frank, but never exploitative and therefore rather refreshing - and certainly made me smile, remembering my own adventures as a kid. The road movie, analogising their own journeys of self discovery alongside social comment contextualising Mexico well between those who have, with those who have not is done well - and done with enough sensitivity to keep the viewer interested throughout. The ending, equally good, was both thoughtful, provocative and makes you review and reassess your assumptions on the film, and the motives of the characters in it. Very good. However the main reason for comment is to say 3 things. Firstly - i believe that Mexico have produced two of the most remarkable and refreshing films of the last couple of years - if you havent seen them, shame on you, dig them out and enjoy them. Secondly, that Gael García Bernal, the lead role in both films has a screen presence which belies his age, and without doubt could, and indeed should eclipse Del Torro as the next big thing south of the border - he is very good in both films - watch this space, and thirdly - Harry Potter is in very good hands, and indeed the darkest of the 4 books so far could be the darkest of the 4 films planned - about time too.

Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can't take it, like my heart's going to cave in.  --Ricky Fitz (American Beauty)Alfonso Cuaron's Mexican Gem Y Tu Mama Tambien Demonstrates the True Magic that is Hispanic CinemaAlfonso Cuaron wrote and directed a beautiful screenplay full of life, noble characters and a heartbreaking reality.  More importantly, he created a realistic high caliber film that revolved around adolescents and their struggle with growing up and finding out who they really are.The first time I saw Y Tu Mama Tambien in the movie theaters I was completely enthralled. Seriously, I fell in love. Within the first week of viewing the film, I saw it another two times. I have admired Alfonso Cuaron ever since. Later on I found out that he had also directed two other films that I had greatly enjoyed years back, A Little Princess and Great Expectations, which were really different from this film.  Personally speaking, Y Tu Mama Tambien was more than just another teen movie to me, (i.e. American Pie, Can't Hardly Wait) instead it was a film about the connections one makes in life, not only with others but with one's self. To be perfectly honest, when researching Y Tu Mama Tambien and its director, Alfonso Cuaron, I began to cry because I felt so proud of him and his work and all the praise he was receiving for it. I know, I know-- this is quite pathetic, but before you judge me let me at least explain.Every article and review I came across did nothing but praise his work and in turn I felt my heart grow with pride. Why, you may ask, am I proud of someone I do not even know? It's simple He DESERVES such marvelous acclaim. The thing about his film is that it has no bullshit, it's attempt to transcend the reality in which the youth are a part of, is so accurate it can only make you stop and think. Moreover, as a Hispanic I was proud to see a Hispanic filmmaker gain such wonderful recognition in the American film industry, because it is the worldwide leader in filmmaking, and for decades Hispanic cinema has gone unnoticed by moviegoers. Hollywood films are regarded so highly, and yet the Hispanic film industry, in my opinion, has produced a finer quality of films within the past couple of years. Not only did Alfonso Cuaron direct, produce and edit the film, but he also wrote the screenplay. Yet another reason why he deserves such recognition.As soon as the film commenced I was intrigued, simply because Cuaron had the guts necessary to make such a strong opening scene, despite what critics and viewers might say. What made that first scene so perfect was that it was neither raunchy nor inappropriate; moreover it projected how sex actually is, explicit, but innocent at the same time. It's clumsy and awkward and real (Sex). It never looked staged or rehearsed, but instead gave the movie a more relatable feel. Many viewers may have been appalled at the film's sexual motif, but as one writer put it, I mean, teenage boys do have sex, with Cuaron simply replying, And not always with a pie (Hot and Spicy). The films sexual scenes were not added simply to save the film, unlike the brainless movies American Pie and Road Trip, but instead were carefully constructed as mature scenarios used to expose the vulnerability and loneliness inside each and every one of us.Actors Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna did more than just play a pair of stoned, horny male teenagers. They managed to deliver lively character's complete with depth, wit, and attitude; a far cry from any one character in a teen film such as Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  Right off the bat we are introduced to these naïve and not-so-innocent young men who think they are ready to conquer the world before them; (a common attitude in the lives of many adolescents, whether they'd like to admit it or not). The film's two male leads were more than just weed smoking horndogs, they are also a pair of friends who truly loved each and unfortunately got separated during the journey called life.Another great aspect of Y Tu Mama Tambien is how the female in the movie was not given the ditsy, self-indulgent, shallow personality most girls in teen films are insulted with. Cuaron creates a striking woman, both internally and externally, without having to include any stylish clothes or catchy lines. In turn we see how these young men fall for Luisa (played by Maribel Verdu), because she is an attractive older woman who offers them a friendship unlike any other. Within a short amount of time, Luisa has earned their trust and their hearts simply by holding honest, mature and wholehearted conversations. Cuaron's creation of a strong female lead was a nice departure to some of the female roles Hollywood has been feeding us.Alfonso Cuaron did not stop there. He went beyond the call of duty by adding an omniscient voice-over narrator, in the style of French New Wave Cinema, giving the entire movie a new perspective. Inspired by Godard's Masculine Femenine, he added third-person narrative with the intent of creating a point of view that would be very objective(Sex) and so that the context would be an important character (Au-Cinema). Not only does the omniscient, third person narrator help audiences understand the characters pasts and inner thoughts better, but it also makes offhanded but pointed comments about the country's political situation (Time '02).The film's ending made it even better since it did not deliver the happy-ending one is accustomed to in this genre. Viewers find out the real reason Luisa decided to join the boys on the road trip was because she was diagnosed with cancer, which eventually took her life, and we also see the strong friendship that Julio and Tenoch once had fall apart never to be restored. The depressing ending closes this movie beautifully because it captures the reality of life in which heartbreaking things do, in fact, occur, whether they seem fair or not. Alfonso Cuaron explains why he chose to end the film this way, The ending is kind of sad, but I think it is also an affirmation of life. Even if you see these two boys completely f*** it up, you see that you don't have to. Life is amazing. It has all these freedoms and possibilities. That youthful energy exists (Au-Cinema).  I could not have said it better myself.As I write I am trying to gather my thoughts together, which has become an impossible task because the more I read about the movie, the more emotional I get. I feel so silly, but then a random quote from a movie just popped into my head that perfectly explains why I feel this way. Lester Burnham, Kevin Spacey's character in American Beauty, once saidIt's hard to stay mad when there's so much beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it all at once, and it's too much. My heart fills up like a balloon that's about to burst.And then I remember.to relax, and not try to hold on to it.  And then it flows through me like rain. And I can't feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life.This film, Y Tu Mama Tambien, is so relatable, it's so beautifully constructed that 'my heart fills up like a balloon' and 'then it flows through me like rain.' Y Tu Mama Tambien vibrates with such life, love and energy, you cannot help but want to take a road trip and spend all hours of the night sharing your most intimate stories with those that know you the best, especially before you grow up and wish you had done it long ago. The road of life is long and hard, but the road towards adulthood and self-discovery is even more perilous. If you enjoy films with realistic qualities, if you love life and your friends even more, do not miss Alfonso Cuaron's brilliant Mexican film Y Tu Mama Tambien; he manages to portray sex, drugs, and friendship in style so breathtaking the whole world took note.

At face value it is an enjoyable romp for two Mexico City 17 year old kids, one over-privileged and the other a little less so, who go on the road with an older (and absolutely gorgeous) woman who for reasons of her own is happy to play with the boys in this particular hot summer.The director, Alfonso Cuarón, though from Mexico, has spent time in Hollywood. He has done an interesting post-modern version of  `Great Expectations' (1998) with Ethan Hawke and Gwynneth Paltrow and is directing the next Harry Potter number. This film, co-scripted by Alfonso and his brother Carlos, is very anti-Hollywood, especially in the depiction of sex and in the sly suggestions that there might be more to growing up than grossing out. As mentioned, I can only assume that the snippets of Mexican life we do see &#150; the beggars, the children's funerals, the weddings both rich and poor, the tough life of the poor, are all for real. (And all for US$5 million.) One wonders what a re-make by Alfonso of `American Pie' would be like. One thing is for sure, this movie takes a hold on you in a way `American Pie' never does. Unlike the `American Pie' crowd (with the possible exception of Chris Klein's character, the amiable dumb jock), we can at least identify with the kids here. Tenoch and Julio (Diego Luna and Gael Garcia Bernal), obnoxious though they may be at times, are at least real in their spottiness, puppy fat and raucous behaviour. Their travelling companion and mentor in life and love, Luisa, is beautifully realised by Spanish actress Maribel Verdi. I suppose she is a fantasy figure, but sometimes fantasies come true &#150; well, up to a point, and this one has a twist.It's funny how so many defining experiences seem to happen on holiday. The threesome, despite all indications to the contrary, has a great time, and the boys do learn something about themselves and life in general. As for Luisa, she has at least emotionally liberated herself from a claustrophobic marriage and can face her future with a certain amount of serenity.I'm not sure the ironic voice-overs added anything to the story, particularly as they often went off at a tangent (`two years ago a farmer and his daughter died at this corner') but they did seem to fit in somehow. As for the road movie aspect, you not only feel you are actually inside the battered Le Baron station wagon looking out at the hot bleached summer landscape but you are with people who are interesting travel companions, even if you wouldn't actually like to live with them. You also feel a certain sense of danger. This is a country where banditry is widespread and practised by officials as well as criminals.

After those two decades due to lack of talent, lack of creativity or -most likely- lack of funds (or a combination of the three), it went downhill faster than a tourist gulps down a shot of tequila. During the following thirty years movie fans in Mexico had to satisfy their needs with productions from the rest of the world because home wasn't coming up with anything worth watching. Then in 1990 Jaime Humberto Hermosillo takes Mexico by surprise with La Tarea and opens a new door for the Mexican movie industry. Following the cue, Alfonso Cuaron releases Solo con tu Pareja in 1991, Gabriel Retes El Bulto, Maria Novaro Danzon and in 1992, Alfonso Arau brought to the screen the highly acclaimed Como Agua para Chocolate. The last decade of the twentieth century began with a good start. These outstanding productions became known as a new genre El Nuevo Cine Mexicano (New Mexican Cinema.) From then on Mexican film makers (always struggling with the money factor) have managed to produce the following extraordinary films 1993 Cronos - Guillermo del Toro 1994 Principio y Fin - Arturo Ripstein 1995 El Callejon de los Milagros - Jorge Fons (49 intl' awards), Dos Crimenes - Roberto Sneider, La Reina de la Noche - Arturo Ripstein, Sin Remitente - Carlos Carrera. 1996 Salon Mexico - Jose Luis Garcia Agraz, Profundo Carmesi - Arturo Ripstein. 1997 Santitos - Alejandro Springall 1998 La Otra Conquista - Salvador Carrasco 1999 Sexo, Pudor y Lagrimas - Antonio Serrano, Todo el Poder - Fernando Sarinana 2000 La Ley de Herodes - Luis Estrada, Amores Perros - Alejandro Gonzalez-Inarritu, Por la Libre - Juan Carlos de Llaca, El Funeral de los Dedos - David J. Delgado 2001 Y tu Mama Tambien - Alfonso Cuaron, De la Calle - Gerardo Tort 2002 Vivir Mata - Nicolas Echevarria, La Habitacion Azul - Walter Doehner. So lets see... 25 good Mexican movies in 12 years. That's not bad considering that Mexico is no Hollywood.So when you go see Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN, do so in this understanding. Know that you'll be watching a film that takes place in a country that has been screwed up for many years by its government and that people have just had to learn to live under those conditions. Know that not all films made in Mexico will portray a protesting attitude towards social differences (no, not everyone in Mexico is an activist). Know that this film is worth watching because it is an excellent production and treat it as such. Isn't it about time for us to learn not to expect foreign films to explain (and offer solutions for) their entire socio-cultural structure?  Be open-minded, treat this movie as the rare gem that it is, allow yourselves to let your fibers be touched and enjoy the ride.

Although sexually explicit, the film does not cater to prurient interests to increase box office receipts, but is always fully believable as a true depiction of how adolescents think and feel. The voice-over narration allows us to step back and see a bigger picture of the world that surrounds the characters as they drive through the Mexican countryside, so it becomes more than just a look at self-absorbed characters existing in their own little world.Y Tu Mama Tambien is filled with joy and celebration and also a touch of sadness. The film has the kind of liberating quality that I have not seen in cinema in years. In Y Tu Mama Tambien, Cuaron has transcended the limitations of the coming of age genre to make a film that is universal in its message about young people and the transitory nature of life.  I strongly recommend it.

(If you're gonna wolf, you better wolf fast/ 'cause your old lady's got a face like a bulldog's Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies...) Having been brought up in the United States and having attended the public schools I am no stranger to the phenomenon of teenaged boys being teenaged boys, having been there and done that myself, including the hazy, sunny obligatory motor trip to Tijuana and points south. But what struck me while watching this fascinating film was how very like the guys I went to school with are Tenoch and Julio. In fact I was a little reminded of the song Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard by Paul Simon. Not much would have to be changed to see this as an American movie about young people in America near the end of the 20th century.But this is about Mexico and it takes place in Mexico and even though Julio and Tenoch rag on Team America there is no doubt that their lives and the styles they copy and take as their own are enormously influenced by American culture, for better or for worse.Gael Garcia Bernal who previously starred in Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's Amores perros (2000) plays Julio, who is from a middle class family. Diego Luna plays his friend Tenoch (named after Tenochtitlan, Aztec founder of Mexico City) who is the son of a prominent Mexican politician. Both boys live the kind of lives of plenty and privilege that the average Mexican can only dream about. And so there is a certain decadent and hedonistic quality to the way they embrace life. But what director Alfonso Cuaron captures with these boys and their adventure to an imaginary beach with an older woman is the zest of youth that throws itself wildly and madly into sex, drugs and the search for experience and the fulfillment of youthful urges. What they learn from Luisa (Maribel Verdu) is something most young men really lust after, that is, how to please a woman sexually--well, at least they experience a first course.Cuaron shows us teenaged boys as teenaged boys are raunchy, randy, irreverent, and as a old army sergeant used to say, young and dumb and full of... you-know-what. Well, not dumb. Both boys are sharp and quick to learn about life, and as the movie ends and they go their separate ways, we know that both will go on to college and make a good life for themselves. In this sense this is a coming of age movie with Lusia as mentor to the boys.Looking at the movie a little more deeply we have to ask, why does Lusia go on the trip with Tenoch and Julio, and why does she let herself go, so to speak? We learn that her husband has cheated on her (again, by the way) and had the temerity to call her up immediately after the fact and confess. Later we learn that she has an even more compelling reason to indulge herself in a youthful fling. (But of course you should see the movie to find out what that is.) The sense of freedom and naturalness that Cuaron captures, not only in the area of human sexuality, but in the spirit of a vast country moving from a largely agrarian society to an industrial one, and the bewilderment that such rapid change makes people feel, is made especially vivid by the focus on the young, since they are the ones moving the fastest. (Of course this focus doesn't hurt at the box office, since young people make up the bulk of viewers, in Mexico as elsewhere.) However, despite what some reviewers have suggested, this movie addresses Mexican poverty in only a token way. This is a movie about privileged Mexicans who could, as I intimated above, pass for Americans or Europeans with only a minor cultural shift.Be forewarned that the sexuality shown here is about as graphic as any you'll see this side of an X rating, which is okay with me. Certainly it is better than the usual violence that Hollywood serves up. In fact I hope this movie triggers a change in the movie industry away from the belief that you have to titillate the mass audience with violence in order to be successful. Sex will do just fine.Bottom line a vital, vivid romp that will delight especially the young. Clearly this is not a movie for prudes or social conservatives--and that's an understatement!(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

Since I cannot claim to have kept up with all their productions, and also recognise that it is often not easy to appreciate films offered in a language different from ones own, my impression might be hard to justify; but I have no doubt that this is an unusually fine film. Its main theme of two adolescent males coming of age sexually has been overworked recently, but such U.S. films as the Porky's series or Fast times at Ridgemount High,or even the Canadian Loving and Laughing are all very immature in comparison with YTMT. Julio and Tenoch, the two lads here, are not looking for a first conquest - in fact they seem to be quite sexually active before the story begins; but they are very excited when Luisa, a somewhat older married relative who has just found out that her husband has been straying yet again, agrees to go with them on a road trip to an imaginary beach, the Boca del Cielo on the distant coast. Most of the film is the story of this trip. On the level of personal relationship we see how the influence of this older woman gradually makes the two teenagers aware of how immature their own behaviour has been, and how they can develop more meaningful relationships with companions. This is combined with a great deal of social commentary on the state of Mexican society which is provided indirectly through a series of incidents that occur whilst they are on the road. One of the two comes from a very well to do home, the other from a middle class one, and their family backgrounds are also observed by the director Alfonso Cuaron with a very sharp but not unkind eye. His direction is quite exceptional throughout, with the same type of keen eye that Spanish Director Pedro Almodovar often shows, but without needing a collection of rather way out characters to make his various points as Almodovar so often does. His characters are real and rounded, and they behave in a very believable way. Beyond this, we are shown the nature of Mexican society; we see extreme inequality between classes resulting in rather heavy handed behaviour by the police. We are also shown the detrimental but indirect impact of an unstable economy, and the hope brought to many in the poorer classes when the long ruling Revolutionary Party were finally ousted from power in 2000.There is a lot in this film but it has no dramatic climax, it simply shows the ongoing character development of the two lads who mature in a most believable way through the many new experiences they share. No attempt is made to suggest that magical changes have taken place in a matter of mere days, all that is shown is the gradually development of a greater awareness which will eventually result in real character changes. After their trip they separate to begin to build careers of their own, but in the final scene they meet again briefly some time later, and we see that although this process of maturing has continued on an ongoing basis it is still far from complete. In a very brief but quite dramatic sequence we also learn why the young woman who went with them on the trip decided to take them under her wing in this way.Mention must also be made of the photography which is exceptional and was rightly nominated for an award - a few of the sequences shown may have been a little too uninhibited for some viewers but the R rating given to the film by the MPAA should provide these individuals with adequate warning. For a long time it remained unrated and could only be seen in Art House theatres or on DVD's. Many thought this was because of fears that the MPAA might give it a NC-17 rating. I was happy to note that this did not occur.

As Maribel Verdu, in the role of Luisa Cortes, tells the boys near the end of the movie, You should be glad you're Mexicans! You should be glad to live in Mexico! To which the boys whimsically agree with a bizarre, tequila-soaked toast to Mexico, magical, musical! The boys themselves enjoy that rare thing in Mexico a middle-class lifestyle, even though they are actually the aristocrats of that country, attending fancy weddings and spending substantial sums of pesos on marijuana, beer, and road trips.The road trip which comprises most of the movie's action is a two-day sojourn through the countryside, beginning in Mexico City and ending somewhere on the Pacific coast. Film makers Alfonso and Carlos Cuaron (Alfonso directed it) want very much to show Mexico as a quaint but non-threatening place, interspersed with convenient motels, friendly restaurants, and the odd roadblock set up by the Mexican military. But the road is always clear for adventure, for imporant life experiences, and most importantly for sequences that resemble so many American-made coming-of-age movies, of which Y Tu Mama Tambien is often a replica. See? the Cuaron Brothers seem to say, we Mexicans are no different from you norteamericanos! They are completely wrong, of course. But that's what makes this movie interesting. Nobody in this movie suffers from that particular North American trait borne of Northern European Protestantism guilt that derives from failure to do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Nobody in this movie has a sense of anyone or anything outside themselves; they live with passion for the moment, they fly into rages when it suits them, and sex is no different from any other kind of activity, though it does have the potential to get males and females worked up about each other. Such treatments make this movie so Mexican it's still very much the Third World down there, even if there are cars, fancy houses, and even paved highways.

Still, there is much to enjoy and appreciate for those who only want to (or can) examine the personal relationships of the film. Luna and Bernal are two teenage boys whose girlfriends are taking off for an extended holiday in Italy. After some frisky goodbyes, the boys are left on their own to while away their summer. (This includes activities like smoking pot, drinking, masturbating and just generally goofing around.) When they stumble upon a more sophisticated older woman (the wife of Luna's cousin) and skittishly ask her to join them on a road trip, the film, and the boys' sense of awareness, takes on a more profound tone. The woman (Mercado) surprises the boys by accepting (after hitting a speed bump with her husband) and the boys are forced to come through on what was really a tall tale spun in order to impress her. The threesome sets out across Mexico and proceed to explore each other's thoughts, feelings and, in some cases, bodies en route to a little-known (possibly imaginary) beach called Heaven's Mouth. While it can be argued that not a lot happens during the course of the film, there is actually quite a bit going on. The boy characters (who at the start threaten to be little more than Beavis and Butthead, but who eventually are fleshed out more thoroughly) are forced to peel off their veneer of superficiality regarding themselves, for better or worse. Mercado is the catalyst that provokes this, but she learns a lot about herself in the process as well. The entire film is presided over by a dry, wry narrator whose comments are insightful and both poignant and amusing. The language in the film is crass, but realistic. As the trio covers Mexican terrain, many glimpses of the people are shown in the background. Here (and in the beginning when the class structure of the leads is noted) is where a working knowledge of the country can come in handy for more enhanced viewing. Poverty, militant force and solicitation are shown to be as common as birds on a telephone wire. One element that will likely either attract viewers or shock them is the blunt, casual approach to the sexuality of the film. The scenes, however, are mostly refreshingly fun and natural (as opposed to the overly serious gymnastics that can be found in so many American thrillers and dramas.) The dynamics of the three leads' relationship takes a major turn when a little too much tequila opens up a realm of heretofore unexplored emotions. This leads to a rather downbeat finale, but the film offers many visual and verbal pleasures along the way and does hang in the memory when it's over.

It comes as a shock to see just one asolescent, let alone two (that is, ALL the male adolescents we get to meet at all) falling for her.Yet perhaps this is exactly right. Julio and Tenoch have been so trained that it seems they scarcely have any natural impulses left at all. As we travel through rural Mexico we see, everywhere, the police intimidating the poor; the camera lingers on such scenes as though trying (and failing) to get a clear picture of exactly what's going on, but the two boys do not; their natural curiosity, which might bring them into contact with something unpleasant, is all but dead. Even their natural lust is all but dead. They pursue sex as though participating in a formal game, and they don't seem to care about this set of rules rather than that very much. When Luisa rewrites the rules - by explicitly reading out a new set, one by one - it's fine by them.The voice-overs are wonderfully managed. They're really a natural extension of the camera work I mentioned earlier just as the camera turns to look at the social context or some other detail that commands our attention simply because it's interesting or important in its own right, even though the action is elsewhere, so too does the narrator. One critic called this a distancing technique, which is surely wrong. I doubt we could be so immersed without it.

The reference is not casual. Both films have a similar core even though they're completely different, structure-wise.Julio (Gael García Bernal, one of the most versatile and exciting international actors of this generation - is there any role this guy can't play?

The destination? A secret beach called Boca del Cielo (Heaven's Mouth).Y Tu Mamá También avoids the clichés of teen movies and goes into much deeper territories. Sex is naturally discussed - and shown - throughout the film, but in a mature way, and Cuarón dives into serious issues like friendship, love, Mexico's socio-economic reality and life itself.

But for me personally, subtitles are the gateway to the world. They open up foreign films in a way that dubbing never does in the same way, forcing you to watch films in a completely new and different light. Asian cinema is simply wonderful to watch, Bollywood becomes more successful and popular by the day and even some French films are becoming mainstream these days - Amelie, for example. But the current trend seems to be for Spanish films and this effort from Alfonso Children Of Man Cuarón is a startling introduction from a director growing in confidence and aptitude.Translated as And Your Mama Too in English, Y Tu Mamá También is the story of two teenage boys in Mexico. Both Tenoch (Diego Luna) and Julio (Gael García Bernal) are young, horny and desperate to relieve their boredom after their girlfriends leave for a trip to Europe. Attending a wedding, they bump into attractive housewife Ana (Ana López Mercado) and immediately strike up a friendship. Jokingly asking her to accompany them on a road-trip, they are both surprised and delighted when she agrees, leaving behind her cheating husband. On the way to the perfect beach (which may or may not exist), they discover more about life, love, sex and themselves than they might have otherwise wished to know.Having never really watched a truly Spanish film before, I can honestly say that I was extremely impressed. Despite the language barrier, all three leads were extremely good and the hidden twist at the end came as a complete shock - very well written and strangely heartfelt, given what had gone before it. The film also portrays Mexico's dusty heat as though it were another character, full of life and colour and culture. It does for Mexico what Lost In Translation did for Japan - it almost acts as a travel-documentary! The film also has a strange narration, giving everything a surreal feel. You never quite get the sense of credibility and that there are hidden depths or messages beneath what happens on screen.The language is course and the sex is explicit (without being exploitative) but assuming these things don't bother you then you'll enjoy Y Tu Mamá También a great deal. It's a funny, beautiful and alternative movie for all you romantics out there looking for something a bit different. It won't be to everybody's taste - especially if you can't take subtitles - but personally, I found it a deeply enjoyable movie with a slight sting in the tail.

True, there needs to be a certain amount of juveniles being juveniles, but in the end, this film spends too much time filling in the blanks with overdubs and basically spells out much of the story to the viewer through narrative.

Most of the movie consists of long, explicit dialogues about the sexual exploits and chemical habits of the leading male characters, who seem to be little more than moronic schoolboys with no apparent motive to do anything other than to devote themselves to the pursuit of every depravity they can think of.  Some of the scenes in which they actually pursue their wretched pleasures are so vulgar that I would probably be censored if I attempted to describe them here.  Sex is reduced to an act of elimination, and words are chiefly useful to describe one's last or next or best act.In a vain attempt to give the film meaning, voiceover narration is jarringly superimposed over the soundtrack to tell us about the terrible fates or hidden pasts of the characters on the screen.  These interludes do little more than force an extra helping of bathos and morbidity onto an already very depressing picture.  The final scene, too, is contrived and cheap, too little and too late to rescue the viewer from the banality of the previous 100 or so minutes.If there seemed to be any real joy or genuine pleasure to the lifestyle of the principal characters, the overall message would be eat drink and be merry.  As it is, though, the film comes across like an infomercial for suicide.If you are the kind of viewer who must be shocked or titillated by a film in order to get anything out of it, then this might be a good film for you to see.  I have not yet subjected myself to the film Gummo, but I believe that much of what I have read about it applies to this film as well.  So, if you liked Gummo, you will probably like this one, too.  I certainly couldn't recommend it to anyone I care about, though.

In fact, many film snobs immediately assume something artistic and deep must be going on because they see a film with subtitles and unknown foreign actors.This movie has been hailed as an amazing insight into Mexican culture and politics. However, any cultural elements explored here are so general, they could be applied to just about any country around the world. Yes, there are class differences and income differences in Mexican society. Some people are more privileged that others. Big surprise. Apparently teenage boys in Mexico are incredibly horny and will have sex with just about anything that resembles a woman. Uh, I think that's kind of a universal truth around the world. Sometimes Mexico, like every other country, goes through periods of political turmoil. This is rather vaguely hinted at in the film and isn't an amazing revelation.The movie's rather obvious observations are compounded by the three main characters' annoying and empty-headed personalities. These are definitely not deep thinking individuals. Julio and Tenoch exhibit the macho attitude and homophobia one would find in teenage boys just about anywhere. So we're stuck with nearly two hours of their sexual ramblings as they drive through the Mexican countryside with their older female companion Luisa. Luisa is certainly the most interesting and likable character of the bunch. At first we think she's a confused, middle-aged woman with a dissolving marriage looking for a mindless fling with two young men. It's painfully obvious early on that her relationship with them will be a sexually charged one. The plot twist at the end of the film, where we discover she was aware cancer would claim her life soon, at least brings a little depth and intrigue to her character. Which is more than one can say for anyone else in this film. Also, the homosexual encounter between Julio and Tenoch is not much of a surprise either. Sometimes the most macho and homophobic guys can have homosexual tendencies. It almost feels as if this scene was added just for shock value, rather than to say something meaningful.This isn't a road trip movie or coming of age movie. In the end there's not much of a feeling that the characters have grown or changed (with the possible exception of Luisa). I don't see it as much of a character study either, because we're stuck with three uninteresting, unintelligent central characters. The conclusion of the film is certainly its strongest point and at least helps to give the feeling the movie was trying to say something insightful, even if it fails miserably.

I'm also going to admit that I find the plot pretty erotic so that's a big plus. It's a coming-of-age story about two teenage boys. Julio (Gael Garcia Bernal) and Tenoch (Diego Luna) are, as most teenage boys are, focused on sex pretty much all of the time. They joke about stealing each other's girlfriends, seducing each other's mothers, romancing older ladies, that sort of thing. They jokingly strike up a conversation with Luisa (Maribel Verdu) and try to entice her into taking a trip with them to a beautiful beach where they can all frolic in the sand and sun. Despite the fact that she's in her late twenties, she decides to take them up on their offer and the three of them go on a road trip.One of the strongest characteristics about this Mexican film is that it genuinely feels like a true story. The sort of story that's too crazy not to be true. The characters and events don't feel manufactured or phony in any way and this allows you to really relate to the characters to the point where you may not have much in common or have experienced any of the events that they have, but you'll feel like you have a connection with them because you've all taken this trip together. The performances are all very good and when the film becomes erotic, it's very sexy. There are a lot of comedic moments but they're mostly there to make the bitter-sweet tale more digestible. This isn't some sex-comedy about a bunch of teens that need to lose their virginity by the end of the summer. The ending will probably leave you sad, but that's because you let yourself get so emotionally invested in the plot and characters that you didn't want their story to end. I've seen it multiple times and I'm not sure I understand all of the subtext that has to do with Mexican politics, but that's what special features are for, so I encourage you to track down some essays that will clear up the details, or watch it with someone that's smarter than me and knows what all of those little moments are all about. One last thing. While I love this movie and encourage you to check it out, even the R-Rated version isn't suitable for teens and certainly not kids.

The screenplay is also a gem with enough time devoted to each character in the film while also representing an admirable arc to their fates. Cinematography has a raw feel but it nonetheless impresses & editing provides a much smooth ride to this road trip adventure.

Re-launching the career of director Alfonso Cuaron, Y Tu Mama Tambien is an explicit film full of politics, subtle commentary, and sex. This movie is also a tough pill to swallow, as it showcases rough emotions, rough dialogue, tough moments of truth, and an overwhelming amount of sexual tension and material. If you can get past the intensity and frank content, then it's a good film to watch. But, this movie is not for the shy, not for the easily-embarrassed, and not for those that lack an open mind. View at your own risk. Don't let it scare you too much though, because this movie is full of heart, humor, and beautiful drama. Everyone has that one major moment in their life when they realize they must grow up, they must do something different in their life. Every person (that eventually matures) goes through that one period of time when ugly realizations open up, leading to them drastically changing. Before jumping to the mature stage, the edge or blockade to leap from must occur. In Y Tu Mama Tambien, we follow a road trip led by three people that deflowers into a plethora of emotions, ugly truths, and sudden realization of mortality. Two young horny teenagers (Diego Luna, Gael Garcia Bernal) with nothing better to do in their lives attempt to convince a beautiful older woman (Maribel Verdu) to accompany them on a trip to the beach. What starts as a harmless attempt to have sex with this woman winds up opening up deep dark secrets that threaten the extremely strong friendship and bond between the two boys. Written by the director and his brother Carlos Curaon, this film not only feels very realistic and close to the heart, but also gets meshed in with the political turmoil happening at the time and taps into what was going on in Mexican youth culture. With Mexico having problems in its government for years, very few realize that those most affected are the next generation of leaders and movers, the young adults. The splitting class systems and constant political turmoil was leaving the Mexican youth in a Generation-X state of mind. This movie reveals all this in a matter of 105 minutes, and for that reason this is one of the better original scripts released in a decade.It is not just the writing that's very gritty; the acting is fantastic as well. I personally believe some of the toughest scenes you could possibly act in are sex scenes, and especially when there are no clothes and no camera tricks to hide the action. A lesser group of actors would have trouble delivering a decent performance when having to reveal it all and engage in graphic sexual scenes, but the three main actors were flawless in their performance. You can feel their tension, you can feel their rage, and sympathize with them when they are at their absolute lowest. The chemistry amongst the three is impressively strong, giving the movie a near documentary feel. Road trip movies always require that the audience can remain interested and invested in the characters involved at all times, and Y Tu Mama Tambien definitely delivers. After a stint of failures, Alfonso Curaon went back to the basics with this movie, ultimately delivering the best directing performance of his career. No shot is ever too long or too short, as he does a superb job visually showing the beauty of Mexico within its fragile status. His directing of the sex scenes were most impressive, as they hold nothing back in a physical scene, while at the same time still deliver the emotions. Sex scenes rarely deliver drama and reveal character traits (usually&#x85;its to make the men happy inside), but Y Tu Mama Tambien's assortment of explicit scenes happen for a reason&#x97;they are not used for show. While some of the dialogue could have been cut, making this a shorter film, Curaon did a fantastic job directing his script. Bottom Line An amazing look at turn-of-the-century Mexico, Y Tu Mama Tambien is an emotionally-driven road trip through a beautiful country marred by politics, reputation, and ugly stereotypes. There's so much more to Mexico then just Hispanics angry at their government and trying to head to the States; here is a country rich with culture, history, beauty, and unfortunate uncertainty. Few movies can represent their city well, and fewer movies can accurately portray entire countries well. But, Y Tu Mama Tambien accomplishes just that with a blend of fantastic writing, excellent acting, and great directing. One of the best road trip movies you'll ever see, I recommend this Mexican cinematic modern classic as long as your eyes can tolerate graphic sexual content and graphic nudity. Otherwise, you'll be missing out on a good film that's rough along the artistic edges.

Mexican cinema is known for its sociopolitical commentary and obsession with sex. So, this film's theme is in no way original. Rather, these two themes serve as a backdrop for the filmmaker's message and unique influence on the film's characters. As with all adolescents, these two boys are in the middle of an identity crisis, which includes their sexual identity, i.e. sexual orientation. Unfortunately, for whatever unfortunate reason, the boys are in a psychological mess and lack the skills necessary to cope with their emerging identities. So they medicate themselves with drugs, alcohol, and sexual obsession.The adult female character adds to this mess with her lack of decency and lack of adult wisdom by engaging in sexual acts with boys and facilitating their homosexual exploration. She has her own issues with the sociopolitical elite, so sadly, she never grew up either.Sadly, these boys are messed up because they lack the skills and adult guidance necessary to process all these experiences. Where are their parents? Their experiences finally reach a breaking point when they are faced with the question as to whether or not they are gay. Rather than explore the possibility, they run away from what they believe to be the source of their torment--each other. That is what this film is all about--tormented and out of control youth with no meaningful adult guidance--a consequence of their sociopolitical position in Mexican society. Unfortunately, the only influential adult in the film (the woman) only adds to their mess, because of her own issues with the sociopolitical elite. Ironically, the only psychologically stable, nurturing people we see in the film are the poor fisherman and his family.

Against this trio's many discussions about sex and the ensuing activities, director Alfonso Cuaron makes some very pointed observations about present day Mexico both politically and socially. These are effectively exposed with the understated and unexpected voice over narration as well as scenes of brutality and hardship shown by the way, through the car windows of the traveling trio, who seem largely oblivious to these occurrences. The apparent smallness of these cinematic ploys is in fact extremely potent and poignant. They are played in a highly unbalanced counterpoint with the teen road movie.This is all achieved with much cinematic style, but the sex both physical and in particular verbal simply becomes tedious. The denoument after the final sex scene while moving, remains unsatisfying. Director Cuaron seems to fault slightly just when his skills were most needed.There's much to recommend Y Tu Mama Tambien.

He shoots his story (from a screenplay in collaboration with his brother Carlos) of two high school graduates (Diego Luna and Gael Garcia Bernal) joined by a runaway wife (the alluring and intelligent Maribel Verdu) in search of a beach paradise in a direct but fluid way, allowing his characters to develop beyond their obvious symbolic significance into recognizable young adults struggling to rebel against the preordained roles Mexican society dictates they play. Naturally, their struggles include copious amounts of drug taking (finally a film that doesn't judge its characters for using drugs!), explicit sex bantering and short but powerful couplings that are as convincing as they are frank. It can be downright hysterical--and it's always entertaining--but it's also the serious work of an angry, opinionated director who knows how to make film as subversive as it is fun; Cuaron's contrast of the relative freedoms of Mexico City with the impoverished and repressed countryside being exploited by a conservative ruling party in bed with big business blindsides you by virtue of its matter-of-fact presentation. It's an excellent marriage of comedic excess and poetic wistfulness, a satisfying work of art with broad cultural appeal.

Ironically, this kind of freely sexual film (and its frequent drug & alcohol use) were made throughout the 60's & 70's, but now it seems so risque in our supposedly more advanced culture of the 21st Century.  My only quibbles would be the narration which is too frequent and seems to be straining for some sort of poetic meaning to the proceedings when the less said the better most of the time (a little goes a long way here). Also, the climactic scene and epilogue are not as 'shocking' as much as they are somewhat unbelievable and unnecessary (or both, depending on your point of view). One sour note is lead actress Maribel Verdú's obvious implants. Too bad. I hope Foreign films will not soon be plagued by one of Hollywood's unfortunate attributes.

Really, do not read on if you have not seen this movie.  You need to see this movie knowing as little about it as possible. Still with me?  Okay... Y Tu Mama Tambien is an instant classic, setting up a standard, even cliched, perhaps even ludicrous situation and then subverting it so that the audience has no idea what to expect or where this movie is going.  The best road movies are as much about taking the audience on a journey as the characters.  Here, we laugh along with the two adolescent, hormonally-charged lads, w*nking and smoking and farting and drinking their way through a long hot summer. They meet a very sexy older woman whose husband is a complete s**t, and so the stage is set for a rites of passage tale.  Standard stuff.  Adolescent male w*nk fantasy.  Except, as time goes on, and the characters reveal themselves through their actions, through dialogue and through the sparingly-used but startlingly-effective voice-over (about which, more later) we come to see that this is actually a much more complex tale, about sex, about the relationships between men and women, between humans and their environments, between law and order, between love and hate. The journey to the mythical Heaven's Mouth beach is at first hilarious but things grow sad and more introspective as the older woman reveals herself to be, firstly, devastated by the break-up of her marriage, and secondly, sexually voracious.  The two lads are hardly up to the task of keeping her happy.  And anyway, it only leads to jealousy and acrimony between them.They drive on, meeting a fisherman and his family with whom they hang out for a while, in a perfect summer idyll that is never cliched or obvious.Eventually, sex looms on the horizon again, but the (alarmingly erotic) threesome that develops doesn't quite go the way the lads had planned it (or does it?). Meanwhile, about that voice-over.  This is perhaps the film's finest effect The cool, dispassionate voice fills us in on various characters at first, providing sardonic, ironic counterpoint to the images on the screen.  As the film continues, The Voice comments on things that the characters take no notice of (like the reason for a blue cross on the side of the road) or things they do not yet know (like the depressing fate of the fisherman, whose livelihood will be destroyed by the development of a hotel on his island).  This adds yet another layer to this remarkable film.  And it is a remarkable film.  It is very funny but at the same time deeply serious and often very moving.  It creates a genuinely human story from the stuff of mindless cliche, Quite a feat.  I urge you to see it immediately.

Julio comes from a lower middle class family, while Tenoch's father is a rich politician, but they are inseparable except for when they are having sex with their girlfriends (an instance of which opens the film -- note that the film is unrated but is almost certainly beyond an R). Their girlfriends go away to Europe for the summer, leaving Julio and Tenoch restless. At a party at Tenoch's house (to give you a picture, the President of Mexico attends and the bodyguards outnumber the guests), Tenoch and Julio meet Luisa (Maribel Verdú), a very attractive, somewhat older woman (perhaps in her late 20's) who is married to Tenoch's cousin. Not knowing who she is, they invite her to go on a trip to a secret beach they say they know but which in fact they have made up. A few days later Luisa gets a call from her husband, who is totally drunk, and who confesses that he has slept with another woman. We see Luisa react. Later Luisa calls Tenoch to see if the offer of the trip still stands. Even though they don't really know where they're going, Tenoch and Julio agree immediately. And even though they believe their girlfriends are being faithful while they visit Europe, Julio and Tenoch are obviously hoping that Luisa will not be faithful to her husband. And so the road trip begins.Throughout the course of the film, we also get a perspective on the real Mexico. We see it through the car windows, and we hear the narrator describe other events that we do not see. The difference in social class is illustrated, though not with a heavy hand, and is mirrored in the differences between Tenoch and Julio. The cinematography brings us this Mexico in a realistic but not self-consciously gritty way.All three of the lead actors are very *very* good. Maribel Verdú plays the central character, with the most complex emotions to show, while Bernal and Luna are teenagers in the process of growing up. Assuming that the sexual subject matter is not an obstacle, the film is well worth watching on many levels, and these performances are the primary reason why.Seen on 5/24/2002.

Y tu mamá también (And Your Mother Too), is a pleasant comedic exception, that has a nice, gentle tone to the proceedings.In many ways the movie is a road trip story - two teenage boys take a woman they both fancy, to a mysterious beach (whose existence they made up), and along the way discover truths about their friendship, sexuality, and life in general. It's a simple concept but well explored here - the amusing script, is filled with smart observations. The characters of the two boys - Julio and Tenoch - are at turns nice, and selfish, logical and quite stupid...quite like real teenage boys. Their friendship shifts and flips throughout the movie, emulating real life relationships of adolescents. The catalyst for this is the older woman between them, Luisa, who has a dignified sadness to her. The acting from all three is spot on.The comedy elements of the movie are character and plot based, centering around the wild antics of the two teenage hot-heads. It's more of a wry observant humour, than deep belly laughs, but there's more than enough here to keep you entertained. The drama moments are equally well handled - the sadness of Luisa is treated perfectly, with the two boys unable to handle the grief and unwilling. Their friendship and sexuality is refreshing - rather than make it into a typical Hollywood joke, it's addressed well and with a frankness we don't normally get to see enough of on the screen.Y tu mamá también is rounded off nicely with observant direction from Alfonso Cuarón, who gives a true-to-life depiction of Mexico in both its glamour and its squalor. The flavour of the place is obvious to any who watches this movie.Y tu mamá también is a nice break from the typical norm. Some may raise an eyebrow at its frankness and casual display of nudity (there's a lot of it), but its all done with taste and context, and never feels gratuitous (there's a great tender adolescent awkwardness to all the sex scenes).

Although the 2 main characters are supposed to be representative of Mexican youth, they fail to give such impression, simply because life in the Federal District (in where the main characters live and where the story takes off) is very different than in the rest of the Republic.  But the 2 main characters, Tenoch and Julio, wonderfully played by Diego Luna and Gael García are don't have to wear such label because they are convincing are individuals and work on their own terms.The movie has a very offbeat use of voiceovers, which is sometimes annoying but sometimes quite helpful, because it gives more depth to what's on screen.Of course, as a Mexican film there has to be some sort of social message. The social message in this movie was bit subtle at times but also painfully obvious- which might seem like a contradiction, but it's not. Lubeski's camera acts as a tourist and many important and sad social and political changes are happening in the background while the main characters are focused in their more superficial problems. It is not done in a preachyway, but it is very obvious, a statement in where the higher classes in México are so self absorbed and egotistical that they are too focused on their own personal problems to notice everything that's happening around them.The movie has caused a scandal (although it seems more like a marketing device used by the director) because of it's frank sexuality, and even though the movie does indeed tend to focus on sex too often, the actors give their characters enough life and avoid becoming stereotypes. But I do believe this film is for adults, at least recommended from 17 years old on, it is hard to understand why Alfonso Cuaron is complaining that this film was rated For Adults Only in México. It is hard to come up with any other recent Hollywood picture which is as open about sex as this one.What makes this movie so special is not the social message, or the sex scenes, but the way these characters interact. It reminded me a little bit of an even better picture Martin (Hache), in where it was a pleasure to hear the characters talk, not because what they had to say was very interesting, but because you could sense that there was a strong bond between them. It is easy then, to get emotionally attached to characters who are as likable and belieavable as the ones in these movie, and sad to see then hurt each other and themselves. Discussing the plot is irrelevant because it is a chracter-driven film, but it does deal with heartfelt issues about how we are all in this together, and you are always influenced by the people that come in and out of your life, no matter to what extent. It is not so much about love and friendship, but about need, about being young and selfish, and actuallly learning something that will change the way you view things.Y Tu Mama Tambien... is not by any means, a perfect film, nor does it aspire to be. For once there is a movie in where characters act freely, not like they have read the screenplay, most characters in movies seem to be going through the motions. Rough edges, and all, Y Tu Mama Tambien... is a film that lives and breathes, and much more than just passing entertainment.

This movie falls into second category.This film is so shallow and predictable, it uses every stereotype and cliché you can possibly imagine. It spend first 20 minutes telling us how horny and wild two teenagers are with every possible cliché you can imagine about horny and wild teenagers. That obviously was not enough, do there's a narrator telling you how horny and wild the two teenagers are. In spite this long introduction to communicate teenage 'hornyness' to the viewer an that they tend to drink a lot and have drugs, NOTHING else is being communicated about them, so they appear as stupid as Beavis and Butthead. If the story is about two boys growing up, please do them a favor and don't show them one dimensional, they are not. People in that age are very complex and that complexity is what affects their emotionally uncertain psyche. Authors are not doing that which is a big shame, they waste all the time showing and telling you how, well ... horny and wild they are.Then the film moves into showing how some families in Mexico are well off and have presidents at their receptions, and how some are poor. Big revelation. Not too much time was spent there, but many obvious clichés used.Then an young married woman is introduced, and again all the stereotypes of used here. She's married but not happy, she's foreign, she just discovers her husband is cheating on her, good looking, ... Again, in case you missed the obvious, there's a narrator telling you what you should think. Guess what? Wouldn't that be a perfect match for two horny and wild teenagers, to go on a road trip together? Wow, your ability of prediction is amazing. So, this is supposed to be coming of age, sexually maturing, yada yada  story. OK, right, but don't do it in a way of throwing all the most obvious and shallow stereotypes in a predictable mix.I did like the shots of Mexican rural areas, but I could see more in some documentaries.

No matter how good things seem at any given point in time, it's all going to turn to radioactive crap and everybody knows it.This movie is a pretty good illustration of the speaker's point. It's a very good movie too.These two teenage boys are good friends, cheerful, vulgar, dopers, who have created a club of their own with a code consisting of some ten points. The points are perfectly down to earth. You shall not make love to your boyfriend's girlfriend. That sort of thing, only phrased in an earthier fashion, as are the subtitles. Chin-GA, tu mama! It starts off as a lot of fun. The two kids meet a beautiful young woman and they agree to make a cross-country trip to the beach at Puerto Escondido. The woman has a partner from whom she is temporarily (then permanently) separated. The two roustabouts each have a girl friend, both of them touring Italy for the summer.The trip in the station wagon begins like a kind of On the Calle, everybody laughing and smoking and drinking and talking dirty. (The nubile slightly older woman blends right in.) The dialogue is amusing in its own quietly raunchy way. The audience is having fun too, perhaps anticipating the explicit sex scenes that were touted as a major feature of this film on its release. Well, the sex scenes come along alright -- both of them -- but its simulated intercourse involving little nudity, and the movie is much too good to be thought of as just a frame for someone's bare buns. And they do not signal any sort of life affirmation either, just a failed attempt at it.The story is linked together by a literate narrator, so the audience is aware of a discerning intelligence behind the half-articulated ululations we hear on screen. For instance, we have a shot through the windshield of the road ahead, as the station wagon weaves in and out of some low, dry, rolling hills. If the car and its passengers had passed this point some weeks earlier, the narrator tells us blankly, they would have encountered a mess of white feathers. Ten yard farther and they would have seen dozens of chicken flapping around on the pavement. Another fifty yards and they would have seen a truck lying on its side. There would have been two bodies beside the cab. And so on. And the camera picks up a couple of those white crosses and plastic flowers that one finds in Mexico, marking the site of a fatal highway accident. And the camera pans from the windshield, through the side windows of the stations wagon, following the makeshift monument as it recedes into the distance. The two boys and the girl don't know any of this of course. They don't even recognize the signals when they pass a funeral cortège walking on the side of the road, carrying a casket to the town graveyard. And so it goes. The girl sleeps with one of the boys, trying to spread love around, so to speak, and being earnest about it too. It's not played for laughs. The other boy spots them and sulks. So she makes it with him as well, trying to heal the rift, but it's never quite the same after that. Barbed secrets about violations of the code are hurled back and forth. They finally reach the beach and are befriended by a fisherman's family who take the three tourists by boat on a visit to distant beaches. The narrator informs us that the relaxed fisher family will be soon displaced by huge hotels and the father will wind up working as a janitor. The camp on the beach is disrupted by a horde of hogs, who will soon be slaughtered and whose flesh will cause an epidemic of trichinosis. The girl makes love to both boys at the same time, while they kiss one another. She stays behind, knowing she is dying of cancer. The boys do not see one another for a year, and then only for a few minutes over coffee, with no signs of any lingering friendship.Now -- I've made this sound pretty bleak, and in a way it is. But still, the movie is enjoyable and often funny. It avoids melodrama deftly. (Eg., we don't hear about the girl's cancer until the end of the movie, by which time she's long out of the picture.) It isn't what happens on screen that is tragic. It's that damned patient narrator, explaining to us that this too, no matter whether it's good or bad, shall also pass. The narrator's tone of voice is dispassionate and blank, as if he were reading a list of names from a telephone directory. Everything turns into radioactive garbage, he tells us, not unkindly. Get used to it.  "},{"Title":"Great movie for those of us who got something out of it.

They are telling one another that they slept with their friend's girlfriends. One boy says 'y tu mama tambien', confessing he had sex with his friend's mom.That's the easy part.  From my perspective, the lady and the journey were trying to teach them about life. The boys were too young to understand it or pay attention, but it was likely they'll grow to understand it later and encounter these same elements as they age.  The lady was trying to teach them about sex and love and living.  The road was trying to show them their past (the boys family came from one part of the road they passed quickly), the militaristic police and opression (many cars stopped along the way with police roughing up the peasants) , the sharing of gifts (the old man giving the boy the hat), death (the small child that was killed on the road 2 years prior to their passing the spot), the passing of time (the long journey), the mystery of life (the mystical heavens mouth was real after all), the local traditions (the town queen festival), the poverty (all around), love and anger (between the 3 passengers), and much more.  Their youth kept them from appreciating it all and in the end of the journey they were overwhelmed and had to get back home in a hurry.Two years later, in the cafe, they seemed to understand a bit more about life and death and they learned that the lady they took on their journey was misunderstood also.

It seems that the two guys used to be what is called bitongo, i.e. young people from rich or well accommodated families with no working interests, saying this because poor ones in Mexico must work heavily to survive, but these were swimming, smoking marihuana each time and playing the role of parasites. The Spanish lady, married to another Mexican guy, is disappointed because her husband went to bed with another woman; he himself, crying, told her what he did. Well, in films you may see many non real facts as this one, so she became angry and probably wanted to revenge what happened to her. For this reason she decided to go to a beach far from D.F. together with two guys, who knew masturbation as the only enjoyable sexual act. She came to them as a fortune, thirsty of sex, she was able to make love with both at the same time, they learned what is sex and went finally back to D.F., she remained at the beach and later died of cancer. The film is different from those that we normally see, the camera moves in its own way, the dialogues are difficult to understand, and to be frank I do not know what the director really wanted to demonstrate with this film. If he wanted to show misery of Mexican people, corrupted police, etc. He should have used more direct language but not showing the Mexican reality from its margin. The PRI party went away for the first time in the last 70 years in Mexico, something remarked in the film, so what? Has the police changed its attitude toward the society with the new governing PAN?

Tenoch is the son of the Secretary of State under the PRI government.  Julio comes from an upper-middle-class family with leftist politics.  Not that these kids care about these things.  What they care about is getting stoned, having sex, swimming and masturbation.  When their girlfriends leave for a trip to Europe, the boys are down to only three things to keep their interest and they assume they are going to have a boring summer.Then Tenoch's father hosts a family wedding at his mansion.  All of Mexico's social & political elite are required to attend.  That includes Tenoch's insufferably pretentious cousin Jano and his beautiful Spanish wife Luisa.  When the boys bump into Luisa, they both start hitting on her at once.  They tell her they know of a beach far away from tourists called Heaven's Mouth that is the most beautiful place in the tropics and they will take her there whenever she wants.  Of course they are just making it up, and Jano chases them off before they can go any further.Some time later Jano phones Luisa in tears and admits he's been cheating on her.  So Luisa phones Tenoch & calls his bluff.  She wants to go to Heavens Mouth with the boys.  So they all get together & borrow a rickety 1983 Dodge station wagon from Julio's sister & take a cross-country journey in which they will all discover themselves, each other & Mexico.The most up-front part of the film is the sexual part.  This is only the second non-porn film I have seen that features a money shot, which is why it couldn't be released in the U.S. with an MPAA rating (the first film--if you're interested--is Pedro Almodovar's Kika).  There is lots of nudity and sex on display and even more conversation about it.  The conversations are of a highly explicit nature and may be even more shocking than the actual sex scenes.But there is another, more subtle part.  The journey they take is an odyssey into the real Mexico  a place of incredible poverty & despair, but also a place of great freedom.  It is a place that neither Tenoch's nor Julio's family wants to acknowledge.  The authoritarian, right-wing PRI wants to sweep the poverty under the rug & clamp down on the freedom.  The upper-class Zapatista-sympathizers are too busy organizing demonstrations to do anything constructive about the poverty & take themselves too seriously to enjoy--or even acknowledge--their freedom.  I would have probably missed this subtext had it not been for the narrative voice which talks about the despair & freedom (as well as the characters' life histories) that occur off-screen.There are flaws of course.  The pacing in the first act--before the wedding--is a bit slow, and the narration interrupts the flow of the story a bit too much.But the acting and story are superb.  I had assumed at first that the two boys were really stoner kids until (*SPOILER ALERT*) the final scene where they are reunited as men in their twenties--played by the same actors, but with radically different characterizations.  And the cinematography can only be described as stunning.  Especially the scenes where the boys race each other swimming.Overall, this film succeeds on both the coming-of-age and social commentary front, which is no small feat.

Invariably when I have seen a film with especially sordid unappealing characters, a lot of crude sex scenes, and a morally incoherent worldview, I know that the film will receive rave reviews from the sort of pseudo-intellectuals who think the presence of drugs and sex in a movie, along with a lack of dramatically satisfying resolution is somehow proof of a film's high merit. And I can see from many of the reviews here that I am sadly right.Y Tu Mama Tambien is a fairly schizoid film in that on the surface the story is of two spoiled brats whiling away summer break and their coastal trip with a sad young wife who is leaving her husband, but there is a constant subtext of commentary, some of it voice-over, some woven subtly into the story about contemporary Mexico, the disillusionment of young people with their world as well as general angst of the people with their nation.Unfortunately, the surface story is not very interesting. A lot of explicit sex scenes starring the two teenagers, Julio & Tenoch, cannot distract one from the fact that their characters, as well as the actors themselves, are, physically unattractive, dislikeable, and one-dimensional. As a result, the sex isn't even very sexy. The young woman, Luisa, is the only character in the film, other than some of the kindly villagers met during their trip, for whom I felt the slightest sympathy, and even she struck me as somewhat unbelievable. She alone seems to have something of a conscience, or to show concern for anyone other than herself. Julio and Tenoch evince no affection for their family members, no interest in anything outside of sex, nicotine and drugs, view women as receptacles, have no obligations of any sort---where are their parents? So, although Julio unlike Tenoch is not from a wealthy family, he seems to be remarkably free from responsibilities. Spending time watching them was painful, and I kept thinking, okay, surely there is something more to this film.On the other level, the one which seems to reach for some sort of political/economic/philosophical commentary, the movie didn't really work. The voice-overs imply that we can expect something deeper, some really pithy observations, but the story doesn't really deliver anything. The narrations serve to put distance between us and the drama. I couldn't see the point in observing what would happen in a traffic accident on the road in the past or the future, for example, yet it takes up time in the film. Once it became clear that these interruptions would not develop further, the film seemed increasingly amateurish.At the end I felt somewhat depressed at the narcissism and vacuousness of the lead characters and felt I'd been drinking from a septic tank.

Basically two bored, rich Mexican adolescents (they look to be about 18 or 19 years old) go on a car trip to the beach with a good-looking babe in her 30s who is fleeing from her pathetic excuse for a husband. These two guys are perfect imitations of Beavis and Butt-head they're dim-witted, profane, keep up a constant stream of stupid, crude sexual jokes and love to masturbate together. The very idea that the pretty, sophisticated Luisa would want to spend even one minute with those two pathetic losers, let alone go on a road trip with them, is absurd. The rest of the movie is what can only be described as a realization of a Beavis and Butt-head wet-dream, having the pretty Luisa join in their constant and raunchy adolescent humor and initiate sex with them. When I saw reviews of this movie I thought that Luisa somehow helps the boys become more mature. But instead Luisa starts acting and talking like sex-obsessed adolescent herself. *The spoiler.* In the end she wades off into the sea like a mermaid and the two boys return home and continue being perpetual children. I am including this spoiler to warn anybody who may have thought that something besides a string of dirty jokes might actually happen before this overly long movie ends. Perhaps the filmmakers thought they were showing that the 60s vision of The People's Guide to Mexico has finally come to a generation of Mexican youth. Besides that, there seems to be no meaning or message in this movie. The sex scenes are always frantic and repulsive. It's soft core porn, but without the erotic ambiance. In any case I'm writing this to warn anybody who may have been snowed by positive reviews by liberal critics whose aspirations may be secretly adolescent themselves.

The premise is hardly an original one, but in the hands of director Alfonso Cuarón and a truly remarkable cast the result is absolutely astonishing.As a number of people have pointed out, Tenoch (Diego Luna) and Julio (Gael Garcia Bernal) are not entirely likable characters they are thoughtless, self-indulgent, crass, and rarely think above their belts or beyond the next joint. But their encounter with Ana (Ana Morelos) will shake them out of their adolescent-inspired sense of superiority in more ways than one as their friendly rivalry for Ana's favors escalates into open jealousy, their revelations demonstrate that they are no less hypocritical than the pompous and corrupt adult society against which they so pointedly rebel.The film is unexpectedly satirical, neatly adopting a boys will be boys smile and then quietly but sharply undercutting it by transient images of poverty, decay, and death that the trio encounter as they move out of their rather sheltered existences in Mexico City and travel the backroads to the sea--images that the boys ignore with a youthful zeal but which foreshadow and then underscore the series of punches the film delivers at its conclusion. The cast is impressive, with Luna and Bernal the very image of thoughtless, vulgar youth, while Morelos is remarkable as Ana, a woman in her late twenties who seems to be fleeing from a faithless husband and seeking revenge in casual sex but who secretly has a still more weighty motive behind her actions.The film has a great deal of nudity and sexual activity; there is also considerable drug use and profanity. A great deal has been made of that, and particularly of the intense kiss between Luna and Bernal--but ultimately Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN is less about sex, drugs, and youthful excess than it is about responsibility in relationships and how failure to keep trust can have devastating consequences in platonic, romantic, and sexual relationships. The DVD package is quite nice, with several interesting bonuses, and although the subtitles are in white they are easy to read. Overall, an impressive film--but one perhaps best viewed by middle-agers with some perspective than by the youth it satirizes. Recommended.Gary F.

It's about not having money.  It's about friendship.  It's about pseudo-friendship.  It's about people not telling the truth.  It's about psychological damage.  It's about hiding.  It's about openness.  It's about illness.  It's about suffering and pain.  It's about death.  It's about love.  It's about betrayal.  It's about innocence lost.  It's about knowledge.  It's about honesty.  It's about braggadocio.  It's about talking smack.  It's about being genuine vs. the alternative.  It's about the vagaries of fate.  It's about three very specific people. And it's about all of us.And that's only in the first 15 minutes!See this movie.  You will laugh, learn, and be moved.  It's a wonderful film.

Y Tu Mama Tambien (translated as And Your Mother Too) is the story of two young men in present-day Mexico (Diego Luna and Gael Garcia Bernal) who have just graduated from high school and are looking for a hot summer without their girlfriends (Ana Lopez Mercado Ortega and Maria Aura Boullosa) who are traveling abroad in Europe during their time away from their studies. Luna and Bernal think the summer will be great, but soon they realize that may not end up being the case. The duo attend a wedding and meet sexy 30-something Spaniard Maribel Verdu (in an appropriately erotic and steamy performance). Soon the awkward teens who always seem to be drinking, smoking and doping are flirting with her and wanting her to come to the beach with them (a fictional place called Heaven's Mouth). She explains she is married (ironically to Luna's stuck-up cousin, played by the scene-stealing Juan Carlos Remolina Suarez) and the duo leave her alone. Very soon after the wedding Verdu learns the results of some medical tests and it is made apparent that something extremely serious is ailing the beauty. Trying to come to terms with her illness, she learns that Suarez has had multiple affairs and she sinks into a deep depression. Her fright and sadness turn around when she remembers the offer from the youngsters and she contacts them immediately. The duo believes that this is the best thing that could have ever happened. In spite of the fact that Heaven's Mouth does not exist, they do not let that small inconvenience stop them from having an opportunity to be with a hot older woman. In the U.S. cinema this would all point the way to a silly teenage road trip film with over-sexed boys on the prowl, but Y Tu Mama Tambien is not like that at all. It is a trip that will forever alter the trio's lives, making them question their wants, their needs, their friendships, their relationships, their sexualities, their places in a complicated world and their futures. As all this goes on they find a Mexico that none have ever seen before, a place where drug dealers and cops have waged war for so long in some areas of the land that there is really no hope or happiness for those unlucky enough to be innocent bystanders. Poverty and uncertainty also plague many that the group pass along the way on a seemingly endless trip into something unknown. Y Tu Mama Tambien may actually be the finest production to come out of Mexico. The Mexican cinema has always been mired for one reason or another because of various factors, but they took a huge step forward here. The three leads are revelations, with Verdu possibly becoming an international superstar (hopefully this will help her career the way Malena helped Monica Bellucci) by the film's emotion-packed finale. The Cuaron brothers (Alfonso, who also directed, and Carlos) developed a monumental screenplay (which brought them Oscar nominations) that has its peaks and valleys and actually plays like lives intertwining and touching (much like real-life situations). The script is one of the most brilliant I have ever encountered. Emmanuel Lubezki should also be given kudos for cinematography that almost acts as a fourth lead (the camera work just adds so much to this picture). Censorship has never been a big deal in Mexico with their cinema, but the government stepped in this time. This is a very rough film to sit through. There are excessive sexual scenes that push the envelope on most everything previously seen in the mainstream cinema. The movie was cut down to only about 75 minutes in one version (there should be about 105) and the Cuaron brothers decided against that when the opportunity arose to go international. The movie received no rating in the U.S. (it would have been an NC-17 easily) and due to that fact it became more of an art-house flick, a movie that very few saw and one that most in the typical viewing public had never heard about. In Mexico, Y Tu Mama Tambien became an overnight sensation. It immediately became the country's largest money-maker ever and quite possibly the nation's most talked about production. Strangely the Academy failed to award this movie with a Best Foreign Language Film nomination (Talk to Her also failed that nomination). During a year where the Academy dropped the ball consistently (think Gangs of New York), the snubs to Y Tu Mama Tambien may have been its largest mistake of all. Even though young people under 17 are sometimes advised to steer clear of a movie like this, it is truly apparent that those in that age group are the real ones trying to be reached. Y Tu Mama Tambien teaches you to not always live in the present, but to plan for your future and to let where you are dictate where you are going. Near total excellence. 4.5 out of 5 stars.

They all have the same structure of travelling by car, insipid dialogues and a lot of long, boring travelogue footage of the Mexican countryside. On top of this is the story of two 17-year old kids that are Mexico's intellectual rivals of Beavis and Butthead, who are hot on the trail of the clueless 28-year old wife ( Maribel Verdu) of the cousin of one of the two dumbheads, who has the bright idea of following these two jerks to a far-off beach called Boca del Cielo, spiced with some insipid sex-scenes, a lot of crude bodily functions, all done in the spirit of trying to be original and shocking, sentiments that are never reached by Cuaron's pedestrian directing and total absense of close-ups in one of the dullest films of the year. Near the end of the film there is a scene in an outdoor eatery where the camera holds on a long shot of the three main characters for what must be four or five minutes of the longest, most boring sequence we have seen in a long time. Cuaron must have gone to sleep when he shot this sequence and forgot to yell cut! To wrap it up, the film has absolutely nothing going for it except for the soft-core titillation of some sequences that don't really amount to much and the empty ramblings of the three main characters. And what is really ridiculous is that the filmmakers decided to add a voice-over narration that has all the makings of an after-thought that is the most annoying, self-conscious tripe of social awareness bs that we have seen, especially since it has absolutely nothing to do with the story at hand. Ironically, this film, which has absolutely no interesting story-line and looks as if it were improvised in its totality, received the Best Screenplay award in the recent Venice Film Festival and the Beavis and Butthead couple of young actors (Gael Garcia and Diego Luna) received the Marcelo Mastroianni Acting Award, which says a lot about these overblown festivals...

They meet Luisa (Maribel Verdu), the young wife of Tenoch's cousin Jano and since Jano is away, they invite her to a wonderful beach, Heaven's Mouth. Actually, so far as they know, it doesn't exist, but they both find her very attractive. After Jano admits that he has cheated on her (again), Luisa accepts their invitation, and the three of them embark on a life-changing adventure.This is a film that will be deeply appreciated by Mexicans because it has to do with politics and class differences Tenoch is the son of a rich businessman and has important friends; Julio is lower class and lives with his whole family in a small apartment. His last name is Zapata, after a revolutionary.However, because of the classic elements of the story, this is a movie for everyone. It's about sex, discovery, freedom, immaturity, and evolution. It's not your typical road trip movie. It's more of a psychological study of three people, one (Luisa) who has had some startling revelations in her life, and two juvenile boys who don't yet know what they're about. And when they find out, things change profoundly.The sex is graphic but important to the story as it serves as a process of self-discovery that is sometimes painful. There is also a lot of humor, too, particularly in the beginning of the movie.Almodovar as usual gives us a provocative film with layered characters and wonderful performances by all three stars. Their acting is entirely natural; the friendship between the two boys is very real, as is Luisa's reaction to them.Highly recommended.

Then we meet the older woman whose husband cheats on her, who decides that sleeping with teenagers and then killing herself is the best solution. They drive and talk and have R-rated sex and that's about it.People often confuse commentary on nihilism with documentary of nihilism. This movie is the latter. There is no real commentary given. Some have praised the movie for showing the poor side of Mexico - but that's all it does. It shows it. Like it's a sideshow. It's an obvious attempt to lend the movie more credence than it has. Then it rolls on, and the fart jokes and adolescent sex continue.If you get great kicks out of seeing teenage boy ass, or from seeing two teenage boys make out with each other while an older woman pretends to give them oral sex, well, this is your movie. There's more nude adolescent in this film than five Joel Schumacher movies. And the sex is boooorrring. It's Skinemax standard - covered shots, rapid movement, concealing camera angles.And the most annoying bit about the movie is the ending. Suicide endings are cop-outs.

There are fart jokes, pigs, symbolism (the boys have a swim race in a polluted pool - diving into their murky subconscious, geddit?), political allusions (the characters have surnames of famous Mexican political figures) and the most annoying voice over narration.  This was a huge hit in its home country so I could not figure out whether this was political allegory or sex romp or road movie or what.  The male leads are the ugliest teenagers (and that's pushing it) ever to grace a screen and they are grimy - you would have to be desperate to shag these two. One of them has the largest, white bottom ever seen that one could project this movie on it. Let's face it you cannot take a movie seriously that resolves its plot by a voice over in three minutes.  I am lucky I saw this on cheap night because I would have cried myself to sleep.  Inept, inconsistent and ultimately boring.  I worry that the director has been given the task of handling the third Harry Potter film.  The mind boggles - Harry and Hermione do Hogwarts, perhaps?  This little black duck was not amused.

Here is my take on the story a terminally ill, unhappily married women set out on her final voyage of life with two unknowing teenagers to a fantasy land. The fatalistic desires from the women mixed up with adolescent sexual fantasies that helped to transcend the two boys from still holding on to romantic illusions to such wild explorers who experimented with homosexuality or even, as the title suggested, quasi-incest.To me, the drugs and wild parties the two boys had already been accustomed to already suggested strong promiscuity. Their transition to what they eventually become is just matter of time. While the involvement of an older woman, and who is dying, is rather unusual, but if you can't appreciate the significance of the transition, you will be easily left out. The movie is excessively erotic (the director claimed that only 15 minutes of the 2 hour movie would qualify for a G rating) to the point that the sex was enough to overshadow artistic or moralistic subtlety.On another note, I liked the director's use of wide-angle lens in shooting beautiful landscape. His choice of the female protagonist was exceptional too. She was a mamacita alright.

As the three friends meander down the Mexican coast, so too a disembodied narrator (who is not part of the tale, but some kind of omniscient entity) meanders off script completely, describing unrelated, non sequitur tidbits (a car accident from ten years ago; a fisherman who ends up a hotel janitor; the history and eventual bacon demise of pigs which invaded a beach camp). With no evil Big Studio to curb the padding, to hone the focus, director Alfonso Cuarón seems to be trying to cut his *Bohemian Rhapsody*.While their teen girlfriends tour Europe, best friends Tenoch (Diego Luna) and Julio (Gael García Bernal) do what every teen male would do in their position - seek out other chicks. At a party, they zero in on one of their older cousins' wives, the statuesque, magnificently-endowed Ana (Ana López Mercado), inviting her on a road trip to a mythical beach, fully intending to seduce her before their fraud is uncovered, yet not having the slightest clue how to go about it.Careful what you wish for &#150; you might just get it. The boys attain an understanding of how the seemingly simple physical act of sex can be so demanding psychologically, as the experienced Ana first seduces Tenoch (in a sense-glutting, euphoric first-time scene straight out of Penthouse Letters) and the next day raunchily straddles Julio. Arguments, confessions (including the admission by both boys that each of them slept with each other's girlfriend), juvenile standoffs, drunken three-ways, bring Ana, Tenoch and Julio closer together during the journey, but separates them forever after the trek.Here is a film where sex is not depicted as dirty, nor is it sacrosanct. There is no mood lighting or preparation. It happens. In this movie (as in Life), sex is simply a normal part of growing into adulthood. No matter what Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell say. It is the social protocol we have set up around sexual encounters that is anything but normal. In ostensibly becoming civilized *homo sapiens* have complicated a facility which every other animal on earth easily incorporates into their lives.As if to hammer home the normalcy, the movie opens with Tenoch and his girlfriend, entwined in naked afterglow, presaging the coming storm by each voicing their infidelity insecurities, coaxing promises from each other that they will never do it with any other ethnicity &#150; which is all moot, we are to learn, as neither of them is experienced enough to have assessed whether they would *want* to do it with other ethnicities in their short period of carnal awakening.No other species ponders sex or death as much as we humans. And this movie presents a liberating, refreshing view of what brought us to this point in our evolutionary development &#150; sex it is offhanded, it is quick, unsacred, unpracticed; no preaching, no finger-wagging, no condoms. Any kind of moralism is left to the viewer to glean - or not.Magnificent racks can only help the decision.(Movie Maniacs, visit www.poffysmoviemania.com) "},{"Title":"Raunchiness without humor","Date":"26 April 2005","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama","Review":" Just like Julio and Tenoch in this movie, I was a high school hormone-crazed idiot, as were my friends, I might add, its just I would never want to watch 2 hours of anybody like that, and then call it entertainment.

I am not so generous.The fact is that only one or possibly two of the characters are adept at professional acting, in spite of their obvious enthusiasm.  The cinematography is pedestrian.  Editing -- especially the breaks in action for comments -- are confusing and superfluous.  Ultimately such problems are the responsibility of the director, but I know so little about specific production details of this particular film that I cannot comment -- except in general terms based on received impressions. (Modest spoiler follows.)Still, it is likeable and pretty, and full of many sweet and funny moments.  Perhaps that is why any somber intrusions such as the illness of the woman or the final drift into meaningless separation of the two main characters seem out of place.  (I am reminded of another film Summer of '42 as I write this.)  Sentiment and nostalgia must be consistent in stories like this, or things go awry and the viewer is left indiscriminately confused.

DO NOT READ ON IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE! You will find it mostly hard to follow anyway unless you have seen it at least once.What is it about these boys nature that is unique? Their relationship is indivisibly close. They share their most intimate moments together, some of which we are privy to, constantly emphasizing for us how close these boys are. They have a feeling of invincibility and their only vulnerability is the extremely small number of repressed truths that they have hidden from each other... all of which we will learn about throughout the course of the movie.Is the character of Luisa merely there as a toy to provide these two teenage boys some excitement on their trip? If you see her that way, then you have missed something big. She controls these boys. She is the motivation driving the trip and she is the one with power, especially sexually.Think about where they have come from and where they are going, what their trip represents... at what points do the characters redeem or purify themselves, and what happens and when. The name of the beach they are travelling to, `Heaven's Mouth,' should be a big clue... both Heaven and Mouth are key to the understanding of this location. They really don't know where it is or where they're going, or even if it exists, but after their experiences along they way they are inevitably guided toward this 'pure' place. Finally, what happens at this location that is significant? What causes the intense regret and guilt that these boys are possibly feeling and where do they go afterword? Why does Luisa stay behind... for the obvious practical reason we learn of, yes, but what is it about her that allows her to stay at this place? What causes Heaven's Mouth to disappear, be exploited, or however you with to see the final fate of the location?What role did drugs play in the whole unfolding of the story? If you take away the alcohol and marihuana would the story still work?I would seriously, and I'm not being at all sarcastic or saying this tongue-and-cheek, recommend some help if you are so sexually repressed that you are unable to get beyond seeing this movie as a sendup of teenage boys, great sex, and drug use.

And though it is less a female fantasy to run off with two younger men, it surely is not so much of a stretch to dwell on the point. The ride is so much more than just pranks and misadventures of the youthful trio; the exuberance and craziness of the boys is tempered by the sometimes wild yet far more reflective older woman, anchoring us in reality and certainly in the eventual sadness of adulthood. Our youthful male characters, Tenoch (Diego Luna) and Julio (Gael Garcia Bernal) are completely beside themselves when the wife of Tenoch's cousin (they meet briefly at a wedding and the boys make up a tale of a fantastic beach they are headed for) accepts their invitation to go along. Initially non-committal, she decides to throw in with them after a drunken call from her husband causes her to reflect on things. The trials and tribulations of the trip are what we might expect; car troubles, sometimes profound and more times than not inane conversations and hormonally-drug-alcohol fueled sex. The last a surprise? It shouldn't be, since this is a film very comfortable in its explorations of the things that drive us forward. Such sex scenes as there are manage to be so well staged and performed that we are convinced we're seeing the real thing. Though the moments are fleeting, enough real animal sensitivity is generated to call them arresting.As matters unfold, the tensions and drama that develop keep us quite fascinated with that old question Where is this going? Suffice it to say that the laughs and sexual adventures of the journey turn into a straightforwardly somber finale. This re-entry into earth's gravity gives pause; it generally does.The use of a narrator throughout the film lends a certain air of truthfulness to the tale. Inserted in no discernible pattern, sometimes the narration is about the matters at hand, sometimes about an incident only tangential to the story (a traffic jam is explained, in some detail, as to the how and why of a pedestrian's death) and even facts about global politics might be related. But these occasional supplements are generally helpful in fleshing out the characters and certainly underscore the relative in consequence of the dreamlike story unfolding.Some great insights into what director Alfonso Cuarón had in mind as he shot this great looking film &#150; the scenery is quite spectacular, sometimes capturing the squalor of rural life in parts of Mexico while at others glorifying the beauty of oftentimes unspoiled sites. In the interview he shares how he devolves this film and shot from his own technically ignorant but youthfully unencumbered POV. Rating 3.5 Stars.

There is no story, no characterization, no relationships, not even a hint of writing or directing talent.It's not the actors' fault. They dutifully disrobe, simulate intercourse, and they look okay naked. But there is less meaning here than there is in the average porn vid.I guess some of these rave reviews are from kids who are excited to see nudity and hear dirty talk. I direct these children to their older brothers' socks drawer, where they'll find more intelligent handling of sexual and gender issues in any 4-Hour XXX video.Though the cast is attractive, even the sex scenes boring. There is not an interesting or original thought, shot, or line of dialogue in the whole film.The idea that this movie has anything to say about politics or sex roles or coming of age is ludicrous. The morons who compare this movie to masterpieces by Truffaut, Fellini, or Almodovar should be shot for sacrilege. It takes more than two actors and an actress on screen to make JULES ET JIM.To repeat ALL THAT HAPPENS in this movie is two boys and one woman ride in a car, get naked, sit around on the beach, have sex, and read page after page of pointless, clichéd dialogue. These aren't characters, they're voids with names.The filmmakers haven't the talent to even begin to suggest characterization or plot development. The political side, which some posters find so intriguing, amounts to the narrator telling us, near the end, that the PRI lost an election -- which has no connection to anything said or done by the characters. Faux meaning doesn't get any more faux than this.It would have been easy to append a phony political point to the film, maybe by having the leads murdered by the oppressed masses -- giving the film at least an illusion of meaning -- but the filmmakers aren't smart enough to figure this out.I've seen many films I've disliked, even hated, but there was always SOME talent involved in their making.

Perhaps it reflects something peculiar about the reviewers themselves, more likely it's just a poseur response of thinking that they have managed to understand just that tiny bit of something from another culture.This film, once it is stripped of all the sex, is just another coming-of-age film, not better, and not much worse, than a lot of those done in Hollywood. Two hedonistic and loud-mouthed Mexican boys Tenoch and Julio, better off than the vast majority of Mexicans (therefore they are not typical Mexicans and what they do have no relevance to the vast majority of Mexicans), went on a road trip with a woman, Luisa. A lot of sex went on, and the film is peppered with bits of inconsequential socio-political commentary about the state of Mexico. At the end the boys learn something about themselves, but probably not that much, certainly not enough to make them look at themselves more carefully and re-examine their lives and actions.The story is littered with incoherent story lines and illogical situations - for example, why should Julio get upset about seeing Tenoch and Luisa together, when that was as Luisa correctly surmised what they wanted. Was it because he has become attached to Luisa, or he had an undeclared longing for Tenoch? The first possibility is ridiculous as there is nothing that indicates this is so, since they got to know each other for only a day (and Luisa is not really beautiful as some tried to make out), and they weren't upset about leaving her at the end. The second possibility is not relevant as they knew that this is what they did - messing around with girls. Certainly when they finally did get together one drunken night, they were so shocked when sober the next day that they stopped seeing each other soon afterwards. It simply did not make sense that if they really had the hots for each other they should let it go so easily, unless you want to see it as a commentary on how homophobic even hedonistic Mexicans can be. In any case, whatever point the director tried to make falls completely flat - for example when Luisa said that the boys are lucky to be in Mexican because it is so full of life when we can also see that it is also a country so full of cheap deaths. Perhaps the two are related in some ways.The ending is somewhat poignant, when they met again a little older but probably not much wiser and learned about Luisa's fate which explained her actions. It is overall an OK film, far from great, worth watching if you are not squeamish about sex (or especially so if you like to watch sex on film), but don't expect too much. The unfortunate thing is that the plaudits that some heaped on Cuarón based on this film led him to be given the job of directing Prisoner of Azkaban.

It was somewhat a correct choice for the box-office of this movie (including the controversy about its candidature for Oscar) but it totally failed from the artistic point of view.It is easy to explicitly guide the viewer, take him by hand and show to him how people have sex (which is very nice and entertaining, but not for a film which was supposed to be art movie). But it is  much more difficult to only  suggest some things and then let  the viewer's imagination to go from there. My recommendation rent Oscar and Lucinda, a movie also about people who are on a journey of discoveries, but a movie which prefers the fine touch to there is more in life than sex but we don't care approach of Y tu mama tambien Or you can rent Emanuelle an erotic movie which is closer to art than this mexican film.

Luisa is married to Tenoch's adult cousin and she hasn't seen Tenoch in about a decade, and she's never laid eyes on Julio before.  In the scene where the three of them meet, the guys come off as completely silly and juvenile, i.e., not the kind of boys most women like Luisa would go on a long jaunt with.   Basically they ask her like thisHey, um, wanna drop everything in your life right now and go for a real long multi-day drive with us to a beach?Okay.Um, right.The director also employs a strange device in the form of frequent voice-over narration to convey information, during which all other sound oddly ceases.And if gratuitous sex scenes, frontal nudity and bodily excretions are your idea of a good ol' time at the movies, then run right out and see this film. Within the first hour we get to watch a flatulence duel; each guy graphically boink his girlfriend; each guy take a leak (in the most graphic depictions I've ever seen, and both times it has nothing to do with the plot); our heroes appraise each other's penises (with some frontal nudity so we GET THE POINT); our heroine squat to relieve herself in an open field; and a sort of masturbation duel that is unrealistic to the point of ridiculousness and culminates in a gross- out denouement that had people in the audience I saw it with groaning.Mr. Cuaron seems to have stumbled upon a brand new style of filmmaking which we could dub toiletism.  Most directors have enough faith in us to assume we possess sufficient common sense to know that the characters relieve themselves at some point, but Mr. Cuaron wants to make ABSOLUTELY SURE that we know the characters in his movie pee and fart. Hence, he shows us.  If this guy had made The Maltese Falcon, we'd have to watch Sam Spade piss a few times just to make sure we remember he has a bladder.If tastelessness is your gig, then by all means see this movie.

The film is about 2 Mexico City teens, Tenoch (Diego Luna) & Julio (Gael Bernal) who hook up with the cuckolded wife of Tenoch's cousin Jano, Luisa (Maribel Verdú). Basically, the 2 horny boys' girlfriends leave for Europe for the summer and after Luisa's husband confesses his infidelity she begs to go on a road trip with the boys, who are eager to take the 28 year old sexpot away to a mythic beach they have told her about.The friends both end up screwing Luisa, then inflicting pain on each other by professing to have screwed each other's girlfriend. Luisa is about to leave them both when they promise they will do things her way. They stumble upon a beach, have some adventures, then get drunk one night with Luisa, are prepared to engage in a threesome, until Luisa simultaneously takes both of them in her mouth. This penile congress leads the two boys to a night of homosexuality without Luisa's presence. The next day one vomits over his debauchery, they leave Luisa at the beach, return to Mexico City, and part. 2 years later they meet at a café one last time, discuss the fact that Luisa died of cancer a month after their road trip, and never see each other again- Tenoch heading toward a life in the upper crust, while Julio goes off to community college&#133;. I do get tired of critics who seem rapt by foreign films that mine the same material that Hollywood tripe does, with just as little success, yet somehow draw raves. Here's the only cogent piece of advice the film imparts, and its aimed only at the Tenoch-Julio demographic Do not whack off too much or you will diminish your sexual continence.

How so many people can like this film really is beyond me; yes it has its neo-realistic charm and that breakaway from Hollywood feeling but in truth; Y Tu Mamá También is a horrible mess of nasty content and fundamental errors.The film takes an 'Amélie' (2001) approach is telling the bulk of its story but when I say story I really mean random stuff that's happening, has happened or will happen. This is put across thanks to voice-overs and images that relate to the events we're being told about. One such example happens when three characters are driving down a road and a terrible accident that occurred ten years earlier is talked about, culminating on a shot of two graves (the dead drivers). It's this sort of content that made Amélie so watchable, so funny and so enjoyable. Here, in this film; it works to good effect but what else we're seeing makes it difficult to like in the long run.I hear and read people say about what an excellent character study this is, well in my opinion they couldn't be more wrong. There are no characters in this film to even have a study of. The 'characters' consist of Luisa (Verdu) who's a middle aged woman and two kids Tenoch (Luna) and Julio (García Bernal). The first thing's first; having teenage, drug smoking, casual sex obsessed boys as your two main characters who just muck about backfires massively here &#150; it is not long before you just want to give one of the kids a clout and indeed, it will not take long for you to want maybe a truck or something to perhaps run one of them over since this film likes to rely on that documentary feel of 'in the middle of nowhere, road movie, anything can happen'. If you think about it in real terms; you wouldn't give people like this in real life two seconds of your time if you were to meet one so why like them so much here? With enough evidence in the opening thirty minutes to relegate the two leads to 'despicable' as they insist on one more act of sex before one of their girlfriends catches a flight or the way they lie on diving boards pleasuring themselves to images of Selma Hayek amongst other things; there is also enough meaningless dialogue and hand held camera work to basically have this film beg you to consider it an 'art' film. Some foreign films I like, some I don't &#150; some are too 'in your face' (Brotherhood of the Wolf) and some just try too hard to give you something you really don't want. Y Tu Mamá También is one of them &#150; I don't want to see all this sex, I don't want to hear what these kids have to say and I don't want to have anything to do with these sorts people.Luisa is another contradiction of a character. She puts her feet on the dashboard during the road movie segment of the film and happily flirts with them (asking them how they screw their girlfriends) but then gets all angry later on and storms off &#150; exclaiming them to be too immature. What a complete script/character contradiction what did she expect? She screws them both and then leaves because they argue too much? She created the situation in the first place and anything that happens involving her getting angry is very, very poor film-making. Even after an hour and about fifteen minutes she actually says 'I shouldn't have screwed either of you.' &#150; Duh! You think? I could see this coming from a mile off.Thats moves me onto the next flaw predictability and content. As soon as all three characters are in that car driving along I said to myself Yup, they'll be screwing each other in about thirty minutes and you know what? That's exactly what happened. I did not want to watch a porn film when I sat down to watch this but that's what I got &#150; character study/development like hell.In the American Pie films you get teenage boys smoking, having sex, getting up to mischief, hanging about, even doing it with middle aged women and that's exactly what you get here but a few hand held shots, some long takes, some narration about events 'ten years earlier' and the fact it's foreign apparently rises the film's profile What a load of rubbish.

Yeah, I checked here & RottenTomatoes before this post just to be sure I didn't miss the point. Made me feel good 'cause I thought it sucked...big time. Road trip? Sex orgy for sure, road trip flimsy excuse for it, at best. Learn anything from the sights? Nope, missed it all. Deal with cancer? No life change here, just the statement that since there is nothing after death why bother with such trivia. No, leaving hubby ain't a life change, just cowardice. (BTW, this single event highlights the problem with the film that repeats endlessly, i.e. what evidence is there that he deserved such treatment? The opinions of two adolescent booby bumbling drug soaked hormone ravaged teens? This is supposed to make us sympathetic with the anti-heroine?? It's one thing to see life, events, situations interpreted by the protagonists and quite another to have those interpretations foisted on and be explanatory of another character's behavior. Can be done but only by an experienced master.)  Want to see the utter banality of materialistic modern civilization? Want to see a wife who cannot communicate anything to her husband? (Hey, he may be drunk when he calls but he went way beyond her lack of verbal interaction.) Want to see promises that are lies even as they are being made? Want to see the acclaimed two Mexicos? Duh, every country has at least two. And far better drug busts can be seen on TLC or Discovery or... Want to see infidelity at every turn? Want to see two realities running in parallel but never meeting? You know, the reality of the world presented by the unknown but omniscient narrator and the other one already fully adjectived. Want to see the film 99% critics pander to what they think will be PC? Then see this film. Shame on you Mexico for pandering to American tastes and aiming for one-upmanship on tripe. You succeeded. P.S. the one positive point, if it can be called such, was the hugely clear gulf between parents and offspring. Positive in that it showed how little parents often know what their kids are really doing or understand their kids or take any time to learn. Negative in that it was done in the same trite manner as the `political commentary'.

Don't waste your time to watch this amazingly stupid feature. Poor acting, unreasonable plot line, bad camera shots and editing,... should I continue? Is it the Mexican Last tango in Paris? Get lost, man! And don't insult the Last tango. Actually I love experimental and unusual types of movies. But this is so far away of Coen Brothers, or even Bernardo Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris. Oh yeah, there is one beautiful thing in the whole 105 minutes of stupidity and false acting - the soundtrack. One suggestion Mr. Cuaron (the director), do you ever think to make a real good movie? Without naked butts, boy kisses, sexual threesome and ridiculous plot line? When I saw Y Tu Mama Tambien I got one decision - The most stupidest Hollywood movie is better than any other, very acclaimed European movie.

Is there any need to show such graphic sex scenes? Soon as the film starts we see a hard sex scene. It should be a 25 certificate because it's porn! I don't care how artsy they dress it up.It's disgusting showing things like the two main actors masturbating and then there semen.and him pissing!!? I can't believe how low actors stoop to with there immorality. You can't relate to the main characters they were such filthy vulgar pervs including the girl asking the boys filthy questions about there manhoods!Also, I hate the fact that there's so much smoking going on in virtually every scene. Obviously financed heavily by the evil tobacco companies!The story takes aages to take off.There's far too many characters to remember at the start so it all becomes soo confusing.The main protagonist is introduced by the narrator half way though the film. I'm totally confused!Its so boring and dragged out.The narration is annoying and dull.Its such a pain when everything goes quite and the narration INTERRUPTS rudely! Its boring the story just plods along..no conflicts or action..it's far too long too!Nothing actually happens in this stupid film.Also, I think that actor is ugly..He looks like a baby alligator/Dinosaur.I hate the two male protagonists they are so dirty and vulgar. They portray a horrible hyper masculinity which seems to be so 'cool', in films. "}]
