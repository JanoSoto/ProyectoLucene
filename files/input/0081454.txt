So I revisited the film again last night. Even though it has been over 15 years since I first saw this film, I still really enjoyed it. I was very surprised to see so many negative comments here on IMDb. All in all, the film is a little dated, but it still contains some very striking visuals and original ideas. The sets used for this film were extremely well detailed and thought out, as were the costumes and props. Hector is perhaps one of the coolest looking cyborg/robot characters ever conceived. The scene where he is first booted up and filled with cyber-blood is just vivid and stunning. After watching this film, it was also *quite* obvious that this movie influenced some of the more modern science fiction masterpieces like Robocop, the (1st) Matrix and James Cameron's Aliens. Several of the reviews harshly criticized the acting and the story, but I however found no problems in this department. Nowadays we seldom see good films with a small cast and a simple story. Not every movie has to be as advanced and as complex as films like Minority Report. And I am sorry, but Mark Hamill and Keanu Reeves can't hold a candle to Kirk Douglas and Harvey Keitel when it comes to acting. I think people are trying to compare this film to all the super budget modern sci-fi movies. Or perhaps this movie is regarded as crap by many because they think Star Wars is the end all, be all sci-fi movie of all time, which in my opinion, Star Wars is MUCH more cheesy and way too light-hearted to take seriously. If you like serious, dark sci-fi flicks, be sure to check this one out. Don't listen to all those Star Wars nerds who crap on this film.

In the Saturn 3 station, Major Adam (Kirk Douglas) and the scientist Alex (Farrah Fawcett), who is also his lover and has never been on Earth, have been researching hydroponics for three years in the base alone with their dog Sally. Meanwhile, the psychotic Captain Benson (Harvey Keitel) fails the mental test required to travel to Saturn 3 and kills his replacement, Captain James, taking his place in the mission of assembling and programming the Demi-God series robot Hector to replace one of the scientists in Saturn 3. On the arrival, the mentally disturbed Captain Benson becomes sexually obsessed for Alex. Then he uses an interface to link his brain to program Hector, but incapable to control his emotions, he transfers his homicidal tendency and insanity to Hector. Now Major Adam and Alex are trapped in the station with a dangerous psychopath robot.Saturn 3 is an underrated sci-fi cult from the 80's with a dark story that has not aged. The plot is very simple but creepy and the cast is very well selected Kirk Douglas very mature but still handsome, convincing that Major Adam is capable to seduce Alex. The underrated actress Farrah Fawcett in the top of her beauty and showing parts of her body, seducing not only the psychopath Captain Benson but ( I believe) most of the male viewers. And Harvey Keitel is perfect as a mentally unstable man with sex drive on Alex. The non-commercial conclusion is also excellent and perfect for the story.

It is what it is, and that is, despite the impressive production values, basically a throw back to a fifties b-grade monster movie. Hector is still one of the scariest movie robots of all time, even if the idea of a sex-crazed machine is a trifle ludicrous and reminiscent of all those horny BEMs on pulp magazine covers and silly flicks like 'The Brain From Planet Arous'. Hollywood legend Kirk Douglas ('Spartacus') must have been in his early 60s when this was made but still exudes charisma and virility. 1970s sex symbol Farrah Fawcett ('Logan's Run') is less convincing as his love interest and is, let's face it, little more than eye candy. Keitel must have been wondering just how he ended up in this silliness so soon after his excellent work in 'Blue Collar' and 'Fingers', but he is creepy enough, though apparently dubbed. I also got a kick out of the very brief cameo by Ed Bishop, star of 1970s cult classic SF series 'UFO'. All in all, an unambitious but generally effective thriller, which has a few dull spots but enough scares to make it some cheesy fun. Just don't expect too much and you will enjoy it all the more.

Saturn 3 is one of those films that always seems to divide reviewers into the two old and trustworthy camps what a great picture and who the heck let this pile of manure be made? And then, it has the ability to have a solid middle ground; the nyah...not bad... crowd. I have to say that I fall into this latter group. I first saw Saturn 3 when I was a teenager and was gripped by it. I remember thinking how cool Hector looked and the fact that he was also downright creepy. In the years before seeing The Terminator Hector, for me, was the archetypal maniac machine that will stop at nothing to kill you in a (probably) gruesome way. Okay, the film's saving graces the overall design of the sets and costumes. Ignoring the rather bleak look of the corridors, the Saturn 3 station has that feeling of being futuristic but also familiar in a Holiday Inn-sort of way, and the launching area at the film's beginning, with that great big flaming hole image effectively acting as a rather cool backdrop. Benson's (and also James') space suits are very nicely done. They give off the distinct air of practicality, like a hyper-modern air force pressure suit, and also a sense of impersonality about them which becomes menacing with the addition of the dark face plated helmets. Adam and Alex's work-out gear, however, is very dated and it's also quite excruciating to watch their exercise routine. The ships aren't Star Wars Star Destroyers, but then they're not meant to be. The way I look at it, they were designed to look slightly other worldly and also practical. Benson's pod that he flies to Saturn 3 looks entirely functional and although it appears rather clunky and distinctly un-aerodynamic, it's worth remembering that in space there isn't any wind resistance so sleek lines aren't necessary. Unfortunately, because this was a full-sized prop for the actors to interact with the other ships do look like the models they are. Hector is a piece of design excellence. For a start, the actual costume is made from metal, instantly rendering the appearance of a real robot. The actual laboured gait and measured way of moving employed by the actor playing Hector (probably due to the considerable weight of the suit) is instrumental in convincing the viewer of his cybernetic credentials. What helps is that we see Hector being constructed and that can block out any ideas of the man in a suit mold, particularly in regards to the insertion of the brain tissue into (effectively) the torso of the costume. Finally, Harvey Keitel. His performance in this film is derided by many as being too over the top and hammy but I think that he actually saw the script for what it really was - eighty-odd minutes of comic-book fun. He had a ball with the Benson character and it's quite obvious that he knew he wasn't asked to do Shakespeare and play it straight. Kirk Douglas and Farrah Fawcett are a let down to be sure. It's evident that Kirk's entering his dotage and the idea of him being an action hero and hot stud when he's the same age as most of the audience's grandfathers is frankly ludicrous. And showing your sagging butt, Kirk? Should've kept those training suit bottoms on. Farrah does play Alex well when she's there to look good, but any semblance of the idea that she's a research scientist just doesn't compute. The film in itself is a bit of a hit and miss affair. It aims to be a sophisticated sci-fi thriller like Alien but the casting of Douglas and Fawcett certainly taint any idea of it being classed as a thriller. The music (what there is of it) is original, the direction so-so and the overall concept is there, but it fails to it the target spot on. An enjoyable piece of hokum to pass the time would be a fair review.

Since then it's been mocked, laughed at, even ripped-off by so-called Classic (Some actually deserved it, though.). Although it's rough on the edges, and suffers from some editing problems, effects, and a low budget, Saturn 3 is light-years better than any of the sci-fi crap that's churned out today (Not counting Revenge Of The Sith, which was good.), along with another underrated sci-fi cult hit Galaxy Of Terror. Unlike Galaxy, Saturn 3 was directed by producer (And best known for Singing In The Rain) Stanley Donen, who took over from original director (And special effects/set designer specialist) John Barry. His directing is fine, but along with him are Kirk Douglas (Who's often criticized for being too old to be stripped down in wearing nothing in some parts of the film, but this was made before he ACTUALLY became a decrepit, feeble old man, no offense Kirk.), Harvey Keitel (Who was unfairly dubbed by a stereotypical British dude i'm not familiar with), and Farrah Fawcet (Who's the weakest link of this film).It opens with Keitel (Dressed in a awesome space suit) taking the job to take Hector (The key robot of the film.) to Saturn 3, a sanctionary of sorts to keep Earth plenished with food. Of course, he kills the real men meant for the job, and goes in the spaceship unnoticed. The opening is full of surreal, trippy, but awesome details, and gives us viewers some view of possible space life in the future. Keitel (Who's character is called Benson, and is referred as the Captain) arrives at Saturn 3, and is greeted by Adam & Alex (Douglas & Fawcet, which their characters' names are a nod to Adam & Eve.). Alex says Benson is weird, and Adam outright distrusts him. Alex has also never been to Earth. We then see Benson construct Hector, a big robot with the tinniest head in the world. He has a synthetic brain, and is programmed by taking information from Benson via a head plug (A concept stolen by The Matrix.) Benson gains a weird obsession towards Alex, said obsession is transferred to Hector, which leads to Hector going mad, killing a dog, then Benson later on. Then, it leads Adam to sacrifice his life to save Alex.Saturn 3 contains some great designs, an interesting concept, a well-done execution, and some flaws. The flaws come from different places, mainly the casting of Fawcet. Some say this was vehicle for her showing off her skin, but due to the film's long history (Dating back to the early 70s, before Star Wars), it ain't. She makes her character a tad annoying, and seems to have not much to do except being fluff. She adds nothing, only causing a distraction from the real stars of the film, Keitel, Douglas, Hector, and the set design. Douglas & Keitel (Despite the awful decision to dub Keitel) are excellent, Hector is a creation of mystery to behold, the sets are great, and the score (Although brief) is cool and unforgettable. The effects work well, except for some really awful ones (Notably the one scene where Hector extends his arms after Adam tosses a crate at him, the riding through the rocks scenes, and, ugh, that one effect where Hector looks like a automated reject from Disneyworld's Epcot Center after getting pushed into the trap Adam and Alex made, although he was smart enough to avoid it first.). Despite these flaws, Saturn 3 is a great, forgotten sci-fi flick that needs to be seen and treated better, especially in the days of dreadful crap like You Got Served, Hustle & Flow, Waist Deep, Stargate The Series, The Matrix Revolutions, and Cars (Which I haven't seen, nor I want to see it, due to my fear that it will be inferior to the CGI Animated masterpiece The Incredibles). See it, respect the effects (Which are still better than CGI), and don't laugh, you'll understand me better. If you see, or seen it, then go to www.PetitionOnline.Com/Saturn3/petition.html to support my petition to release a special edition, anamorphic widescreen, Uncut, remastered DVD. If you sign it, you will be thanked in the future. Trust me.

It reminded me, though it isn't a horror film, of all the times I used to stay up in the past to watch old horror films, loving the fact that although few of them were spectacular, it was just fun to be able to see weird old b movies from the days when b grade genre pictures were often pretty decent. Saturn 3 has a small cast, comprising mainly Kirk Douglas, Farrah Fawcett as his wife, and Harvey Keitel as the sinister Captain James, who intrudes upon their cosy existence manufacturing food on Saturn 3. Farrah Fawcett looks nice and has a blandly appealing presence but isn't that much of an actress. Kirk Douglas brings a rugged, stoical gravitas to his role and is quite watchable, though his portrayal seems a bit stiff for the role. Its hard to judge Harvey Keitels performance since he was dubbed over. This is unfrotunate because it gives his human character a robotic feel. The film is fast paced, thrilling and wonderfully designed, with excellent special effects, especially Hector the robot. Hector is a great creation and has lots to do during the film, once it gets going. Also, as the film goes on, it seems to definitely have influenced the film Virus, with Jamie Lee Curtis, as well as other later science fiction films Though the characterisation seems a little weak the actors put their all into it and since the film becomes focused on the Hector and technological villainry the lightly drawn characters don't hurt too much. The screenplay runs swiftly and has sufficient vigor to paper over any cracks. Oddly, the screenplay is by acclaimed writer Martin Amis who penned great works such as Money or London Fields. Sadly the film has little of his sparkling language or savage wit but it does have a lot of excitement, some interesting themes and good dystopian details, especially in Keitel's characters attitudes. The final half hour or so is constantly tense and gripping, mounting to an inspired climax before a slightly weak final few moments. Sadly the film seems destined to mainly be seen in a truncated form instead of the 100 or so minute one mentioned on IMDb. The film definitely could have been more fleshed out, for there is the odd interesting point that is not expanded. However, the 85 or so minute cut is a such a tight, compelling ride that it is hard to criticise. With better acting, more characters or the 100 minute cut this could possibly have been really great. As it is I'd still definitely recommend it to science fiction or robot movie enthusiasts since its has some great ideas, effects that hold up well today and some good thrills. Worthwhile.

This was a Grindhouse movie shown in little theatres, not in huge complexes. I went to see it not expecting much&#x85;Not expecting, but got This film had the coolest robot I had ever seen in my life. Back then I was not familiar with Harvey Keitel, I did not know that Roy Dotrice had overdubbed his voice, all I knew is this creepy guy, opens an airlock on a space station and lets his Captain fall through, shattering him into a million pieces of gore, and that was disturbing, and it was shown within the first 5 minutes of this film - And Keitel, who at the time was hidden by a black space helmet, giggling about killing this guy in that horrible way, what kind of film is this with a beginning like that.Not the best Stanley Donen film, but Donen clearly had a talent for doing the best he could with very low budgets, it could have used a few more dollars in the effects budget. It is highly Likely that John Barry directed a lot of this, and his design handiwork is evident.After seeing Space done so beautifully and economically by Ridley Scott in Aliens, this film for me was a return to my roots of Low Budget Science Fiction, which I grew up on, so I enjoyed the cheesy view of Saturn's Rings, I even loved the 2-D effect of the space station, and Donen's directing of the initial scene where you think is this going to be a musical in space? But there were some good effects despite the Apparent lack of dollars to make them really good. And I first saw this in the theater, and things always look better on that huge screen, until you see it on TV and it looks Cheap.So now, 32 years after I sat in that theater and was creeped out by Harvey Keitel and his robot Hector - I found a fairly good transfer of that film online and got it - And I watched it last night, for the first time in 3 decades. And I still liked it, the interactions between Kirk Douglass, Farah Fawcett and Harvey Keitel were subtle and the dialog was understandable although a future slang was being used, we can get the gist of the conversations... No Taction Contact! IE, Do Not Touch! - Kirk Douglas was far from being a decrepit old man in this film, he plays the lead role in his usual way, although toned down from his gritting teeth roles like Spartacus. In fact, this was the first film I had seen Douglas in where he was very subdued in manner but held his authority, when usually he acts with a lot more force behind his words and actions. I think this was probably the biggest Movie role for Farah , not counting several made for TV movies like The Burning Bed.The Saturn 3 set is convincing as a space habitat, except of course the gravity would be less than earth's, there is no mention of artificial gravity, so we have to take all that for granted in the film.The Hector concept, was the first time I had seen in a movie, that a robot had to be programmed from a human brain, and if that brain has problems I'm not malfunctioning, You are as Hector tells Benson- So this film makes clear that a guy who giggles over murdering his captain in cold blood, if this guy is the template for Hector's Programming, then watch out - The film made this concept very clear. This was also the first time in a movie where we see a socket at the base of a man's skull, this has been used in Science Fiction movies up to The Matrix.The design of some of the space-ships came from earlier science fiction movies, and we can blame veteran effects man Wally Veevers for some of the opticals in this film... The three-winged craft that comes to check on Saturn 3 is very familiar- I like that this was done that way, it connected this film which was at the time, a modern science fiction film, to its predecessors from the late 50's and early 60's. Most of the spaceships look like they came from the covers of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction or Analog Science Fiction or Galaxy or any number of those pulps where these stories came from...And of course, the writer of this story was Martin Amis, the son of author Kingsley Amis, who wrote several science fiction stories with slants like used in this film.So basically, this was a B Movie that got some attention because of the then use of Kirk Douglas and Farah Fawcett, it could have been a great film, but as it is, it is not horrible, the science is believable, the effects typical but not great, the resolution not perfect but satisfying. The story could have been fleshed out a bit more, but as it is, the robot Hector, I remembered that Robot, when I saw Terminator I thought of Hector, when I saw Aliens I thought of Hector, there were a lot of possibilities for that character, this was not just an Evil Robot but a robot that became evil because of the way it was taught - Much like people in that respect. And that cylinder that held Hectors Brain - was creepy, any brain that is 4 times the size of a human brain, well you just have to say Why is that a BAD IDEA?

Their idyllic existence gets ripped asunder by the intrusive presence of the depraved and unhinged Captain Benson (Harvey Keitel in fine menacing form) and his equally dangerous robot helper Hector.Director Stanley Donen offers a chilling vision of a cold, grim, and hedonistic future, relates the dark and compelling story at a steady pace, and generates some real nerve-wracking tension in the harrowing last third. The intelligent script by Martin Amis addresses such pertinent issues as overpopulation, depletion of precious resources, invasion of privacy, and the dehumanizing impact of advanced technology on mankind's soul in a thoughtful and provocative manner. Moreover, this film makes a valid point that technology is only as good or bad as the purpose it's put to use for. The lavish set design and snazzy special effects are pretty impressive (the towering Hector in particular comes across as genuinely imposing and frightening). The fact that Keitel's trademark New York accent was dubbed by Roy Dotrice with a more continental voice adds to the character of Benson's overall creepiness. Elmer Bernstein's spare pulsating score hits the moody spot. The glossy cinematography by Billy Williams provides a pleasing polished look. A neat and unjustly maligned movie.

Donen made some great films in the 50s and 60s (Singin' In The Rain, Seven Brides For Seven Brothers, Charade), but here he's in disappointing form. Partly that may be due to the fact that the project was originally to be directed by John Barry, but Donen inherited the responsibility when Barry quit due to ill health. However, Donen should not be made to shoulder all the blame. The script by Martin Amis leaves the actors to contend with some bad lines and situations. Elmer Bernstein contributes a forgettable music score which is well below his usual standard. And even the actors - all of them talented - seem indifferent to the project. Kirk Douglas, for example, seems to have accepted the role simply to enjoy some saucy nude scenes with sexy co-star Farrah Fawcett.Essentially, the story is a three-handed thriller (or, four-handed, if you count Hector the droid). Saturn 3 is Titan, the third moon of Saturn (hence the name), and it is here that scientists Adam and Alex (Douglas and Fawcett) live in blissful isolation, developing food supplies for people on Earth. Adam and Alex not only work together - they sleep and shower together too, which is a pretty enviable arrangement for Adam (who is about 30 years older than his sexy assistant). Into this perfect space oasis comes psychopathic Benson (Harvey Keitel), another scientist who has recently murdered a shuttle captain. Benson has brought with him a droid named Hector, supposedly to speed up the workload. However, Hector turns out to be a particularly unstable droid, particularly when the randy robot develops a liking toward Alex. Eventually it becomes clear that neither Adam nor Benson can control the droid, and with Hector determined to kill anyone who stands in the way of himself and Alex, that becomes something of a problem.......If Saturn 3 is a story of jealousy and desire, then it needs more than a sex-starved droid to generate credibility. If it is a sci-fi actioner, then it needs more action. If it was conceived as a sci-fi thriller then it most assuredly needs more thrills. The film emerges as a rather muddled and unappealing mess, with flashes of eroticism and very sporadic flashes of action. It marks a low point in Donen's directorial career, and is too forgettable to be remembered as a significant sci-fi work. Most of the folks associated with this one probably don't give it pride of place on their CVs.

The only difference is in the lower budget the studio had to spend on models, props, and other special effects.Scientist Adam (Kirk Douglas) and his colleague/lover Alex are stationed on an experimental hydroponics research station on one of the moons of Saturn. Their peaceful existence is interrupted by the arrival of Captain Benson (Harvey Keitel). He's been sent to assemble a robot named Hector who will likely replace Adam in the hopes of making the station run more efficiently. It slowly becomes obvious the robot has a mind of its own. It will stop at nothing to take over the station and liberate itself from the control of any humans.Saturn 3 is rated R for violence, language, adult situations, drug use, and brief nudity. The brief nudity is basically a flash of Farah Fawcett's breasts and the butt of Kirk Douglas. Both are unnecessary and add nothing to the story. Harvey Keitel and Hector both lust over the scantily-clad Fawcett. Keitel tells her that on Earth, everyone is promiscuous in the future. They've come to all just enjoy each other sexually with no inhibitions.To common everyday movie audiences, Saturn 3 will come across as just another misstep for any of the actors and filmmakers involved. Cult classic enthusiasts will understand it for what it is. It's an overlooked and slightly damaged gemstone worthy of its place next to Meteor, Outland, Lifeforce and other forgotten treasures of the era.

It's an above-average picture. It's innovative, with a robot antagonist several years ahead of The Terminator. The sets are extremely well done. The action is continuous. The special effects are very well done. Personally, I prefer them to computer-generated effects.It's possible that modern sci-fi fans brought up on a different kind of sci-fi movie and effects find this not to their liking. Perhaps the story is too closed in and limited for them. There are only 3 main characters, plus the robot, and they are all enclosed in a space station. The photography is dark and the picture functions as much as a mystery-noir-thriller than as a sci-fi piece.Although there is a good deal of action, there is a large psychological component to the story. Keitel, who is crazed, opens the story with a murder so that he can go to Saturn's third moon (there are 60!) and build the robot Hector via transferences from his brain to the robot's. This turns the robot into something very threatening. The robot looks as real as can be. Eventually, Keitel and Hector merge into an android, a part of the story relatively undeveloped. Both Hector and Keitel have a strong desire for Fawcett, who is a one-man woman and happy with the older Douglas.This story has no doubt been done before. It has been partly done in the western Thunderhoof, for example, which has but 3 characters. In that one William Bishop tries to woo Mary Stuart from grizzled Preston Foster.Keitel played his part rather robotically and without any voice accent, which was good. At first I thought his voice was dubbed, it sounds that different. I am not entirely sure, but I think it's his voice. At any rate, his performance works.To my mind, the sets, the robot, and Keitel's character stand out. The compact story helps, and so does Kirk Douglas. Farah Fawcett is good as the naive female who has never seen earth and wants to try some new adventures, including a Blue drug.

It also proves that despite his age, Kirk Douglas remains as fit and athletic as ever&#151;and that Farrah Fawcett's talent is really how loud she can shriek.Although Saturn 3 has the elements to make it a minor classic as sci-fi suspense thrillers go, the movie flounders because of awkward scripting, phony special effects, and Stanley Donen's lackluster helming.The story is set in the future, with neither date nor year provided. The action confines itself to the maze-like setting of a space station. A mentally unbalanced captain, Benson (Harvey Keitel of Mean Streets), murders a fellow officer on board a huge space ship by blowing him out of the ship's escape hatch. The captain then takes the dead man's place on a mission to deliver a robot to an experimental food laboratory on Saturn manned by Adam (Kirk Douglas of The War Wagon) and Alexis (Farrah Fawcett of Charlie's Angels). In the words of Adam, if the universe needed an enema, they'd stick the nozzle in at Saturn 3.When the captain arrives, he claims that he is there to help Adam and Alexis with their research which has fallen behind schedule. He has also brought along a new robot, the first of the new demigod series to aid them. The captain also takes more than a passing interest in Alexis and decides to steal her from Adam.Meanwhile, the captain assembles the robot&#151;named Hector&#151;and teaches him through direct input from the captain's brain to the robot's huge capsule-encased brain. Eventually, Hector turns against the captain and tries to take over Saturn 3.Scenarists Martin&#151;actor & novelist turned writer--Amis and Oscar-winning Star Wars art director John Barry establish textbook suspense by putting Saturn 3 into shadow lock when an eclipse occurs. Shadow lock lasts for 22 days, cutting our trio off from the rest of the universe. No radio messages can be sent from Saturn 3 and none received. What could be more unnerving than to be trapped in a space lab on a desolate planet&#151;especially with a mad robot on the loose! Long before the space station goes into shadow lock, Saturn 3 is in trouble. Amis never explains why Benson murdered his fellow officer. Or what Benson hoped to gain at the space station. We don't really know if Hector was bound for Saturn 3. Amis never really gets Douglas and Fawcett into any tight spots. There are several close calls, but nothing that will put you on the edge of your seat.As the movie's chief villain, Hector-the-robot offers few surprises. Certainly, he looks intimidating, but he's not nearly as vicious or intelligent as the monster in Ridley Scott's Alien. At one point, Adam disables Hector by overloading its batteries when the robot tries to recharge itself. Later, Adam tries to kill Hector by blowing him up. Why didn't Adam simply just run Hector's batteries down and overload him again? More often than not, a science fiction movie is only as good as its special effects. In this department, Saturn 3 leaves a lot to be desired. The space ships look like plastic models, and the planets seem to be cardboard cut-outs. Veteran director Stanley Donen, with help from Barry, generates atmosphere and suspense, but Saturn 3 drags along in places, suddenly accelerates, and then stalls out. There are some good moments, like Benson teaching Hector. Kirk Douglas and Farrah Fawcett make a good duo. Elmer Bernstein's sinister music reminds you a little of Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey. While Saturn 3 cannot begin to compare with 2001, Star Wars, and Star Trek, Donen's film surpasses The Black Hole and Starship Invasions. If you enjoy science fiction movies, hokum like Saturn 3 should appeal to you.

I watched this movie last night and thought it was OK. I remember seeing this when I was only 10, on TV and thought it was really cool; but it was on TV and I was so young. It's one of those sci-fi pictures U would find on Mystery Science Theater late at night, but I never considered it awful. Yes, the special effects are lacking and some of the scenes U can tell are filmed in miniature. It's a B sci-fi movie but it's not bad, considering most of the cast just consist of 3 main characters and a robot. The plot is a basic one, a not so stable astronaut, kills one who is going to Saturn 3. He takes his place and the terror is about to begin. Once there you can tell Capt. James is a few shy of a six pack when he meets Adam and Alex. The 2 scientists who reside there and who are conducting new ways of food production for Earth from Saturn 3, an outpost hydroponic food production . Once settles in Capt. James begins to build a robot, named Hector, a new model the company is starting to use. Once complete, he shows off his creation to Adam and Alex. Capt. The robot is creepy enough; but what's creepier his his direct input to the robot, by taking information from his brain into Hector's. Hector eventually turns on Capt. James and eventually comes after Adam and Alex. It's up to Alex and Adam to stop this robot from hell and try to escape with their lives. This movie is far from Star Wars, but give it a try.THX, -Kris L.

It's by no means perfect, but there's a lot to enjoy. In many ways, it initially comes over as a robotic take on Alien. This is not inaccurate, but it's a small part of it. What we have in Saturn 3 is a wide selection of themes. Love hidden away in a far-flung corner of a permissive, hedonistic society. The evils of simple lust, jealousy and envy. How man's creations can turn on him, totally dependant on how we create them, and what parts of ourselves we allow them to emulate. It's not just about the 'robot-gone-bad' scenario. Hector is a villain, only because of the worst parts of humanity that he becomes imbued with. On top of that, we have a solid, dark adventure. In fact, you'll see some scenes that look to have directly influenced James' Cameron's 'Aliens', notably the hiding-under-the-floor scene, amongst others.Saturn 3 has some wonderful production design for the interior sets and props. Hector is a fantastic fusion of ideas. Hulking body, twisted and exposed muscle and vein-like wiring, and a set of eyes that perfectly undermine your expectations to create something rather more menacing. You expect a large, threatening head on that body. Instead you get only two searching eyes. The interior of the outpost is excellently realised. It doesn't go for the obvious route, emulating either Alien or 2001, but is somewhere between. It's own take on those. There are occasionally some obvious 70s influences, making it less timeless than a film like Alien, but they're not detrimental to the over-all film.Unfortunately, it is badly let down by some fairly dreadful model effects, for which there was little excuse in the wake of Star Wars and Alien. Though you do get the impression this is due to budget cuts at the end of production. The design of the ships, etc, is excellent. It is simply the effects themselves that clearly lacked time and money.To top it all off, Saturn 3 has an outstanding score by Elmer Bernstein. It is full of atmosphere, sometimes full of awe and grandeur, while at others almost demonic in its themes for Hector.Kirk Douglas delivers a solid performance, while Farrah Fawcett is functional, and a suitably attractive damsel in distress. Harvey Keitel does a fair performance as Benson, and ironically I feel he is more menacing with his voice dubbed by Roy Dotrice (Done well enough, that if you didn't know Keitel, you couldn't tell).There's a lot to enjoy in Saturn 3. It's full of ideas and stands up surprisingly well (Excluding some model effects). It's one of those films where you feel, with just a little more effort, really could have been a sci-fi classic. As it stands, it's still an under-rated and excellent film.

What's next, George A. Romero remaking 'Dirty Dancing'?? Less surprising than the awkward director choice, however, is how silly and redundant this movie is... It totally lacks the originality, creativity and &#150; especially &#150; the credibility in order to become memorable science fiction. All it is now is an at times entertaining SF romp with a good cast and a couple of really nice gimmicks, but those hoping for another cool genre milestone will be sorely disappointed. Saturn 3 stars Kirk Douglas and Farrah Fawcett as a pretty much carefree space couple, stationed in a control base on one of Saturn's Moons. Their jolly lifestyle is about to end abruptly when the grumpy Capt. Benson (Harvey Keitel) comes to build an all-knowing Meccano-robot. In one of the most ludicrous plot-twists ever, the robot (basically made from pipes and wires!!) becomes obsessed with Fawcett's ravishing body. Not that we can blame anybody for wanting to jump Farah Fawcett (she's ultra-hot again!) but this premise is a little too stupid to build a complete, supposedly 'adult' science fiction screenplay 'round. Trained genre fans can play a game spotting all the other (and more successful) titles that heavily influenced the story. The list is rather impressive, with Star Wars, 2001 &#150; A Space Odyssey, Alien, Zardoz and Dark Star as the most obvious ones. Some of the dialogues Kirk Douglas has to produce are terribly cheesy and for some incomprehensible reason, Harvey Keitel seems to talk with a dubbed voice. Watching Saturn 3 isn't a total waste of time, but there sure are better SF gems to purchase.

My own curiosity stems from the fact that Martin Amis was the screenwriter here. For those who don't know, Amis is the gold standard for modern literary fiction (although more recently, he has been off-form, c.f. the horrendous Yellow Dog). His narrative prose is too often described as Mandarin; that is, erudite, rife with classical allusion, and thoroughgoing familiarity with the major English writers and poets (particularly and most importantly Milton, whose Paradise Lost he basically cannibalizes for the plot and much of the language of his The Information, and also P.G. Wodehouse, whose prose style his is most akin to). Amis, the son of novelist Kingsley Amis, claims to have read nothing but comic books as a boy. There's nothing overtly Amis-ian about the dialogue itself -- one or two stillborn jokes about Saturn being the place where they would insert the tube if the solar system needed an enema (which sounds like the astro-physics stuff from The Info or London Fields, where sodomy is talked about in terms of black holes, and Nicola herself is a black hole of sex, right?). There are erudite elements like classical references to the Roman god Saturn (at least in the title itself, and not really developed in the screenplay) and naming of the robot Hector, of the Demigod III series (one of the characters constantly reminds us of Hector's bad treatment at the hands of Achilles, to wit, Hector's body was dragged around the walls of Troy by Achilles). The acting by Douglas and Fawcett is just unbelievably bad. No way to get around it. As I think back on it, the screenplay may have been pretty good actually, but their delivery was ruining it, every time. Douglas's big, hammy face and shoulders filling up the screen and stepping all over what may have been witty little bits here and there. He was badly, badly mis-cast in this one -- it should've been someone like Jack Lemmon or Kevin Spacey. Farrah Fawcett (earning her paycheck as a set decoration, basically) was perfectly cast, in light of the fact that this is basically an Adam and Eve In Space story. Amis's females (c.f. Other People, or Success) tend to take Milton's Eve as their model. Now, if the execution, in terms of acting or staging what-have-you, didn't come off, the overall structure of the thing was anagogically sound. There's no question that Amis's novelist's sense of architecture was at its high ebb at this part of his career (the contemporaneous book would be Success, Amis's most cleanly and cleverly plotted). As I said, it's basically Adam and Eve in space, and the ending, as with our first parents, is not a happy one. Harvey Keitel is the intruder on Douglas's and Fawcett's Eden. And what's interesting is that his character is a forebear of the Devil character in Amis's later novel, The Information, Scozzy. Keitel's character is, like Scozzy, a sort of cyborg, a series of pixellated surfaces, motivated only by desire for Fawcett. By the end of the movie, his person merges with the robot Hector. The movie's coda was surprisingly strong, actually, almost unwarrantedly powerful, given the crappiness of what had led up to it. Overall, you'd have to give Amis credit for trying to bring depth to a pretty shallow genre (references to Homer, Virgil, and Genesis, in a 90 minute sci-fi horror flick), and for knowing when to get out of the way for the visual aspect of the action.

It has a realistic depiction of future and a thought provoking story. I have read Roger Eberts review which is a total embarrassment and seemed to be written by a 10 year old boy rather than a famed critic. He criticizes the film for being unrealistic, i.e. the gravity being almost the same on Earth.. Come on! Almost every major film from Star Wars to Alien depicts gravity even in spaceships. This film takes place in a moon of Saturn which has similar size to earth, so naturally gravity is close to the one on earth. Inhabitants wear oxygen helmets when outside the station, they pass through decontamination chambers and all other details are very finely handled. This is no cartoon fantasy with lightsabers and wampa-dampa monsters. This is serious stuff which even inspired some future films like The Terminator and The Matrix. Also, there is a light but good story behind it.. Just one scene from the film, the chess scene can be viewed as a summary of the plot. Adam (note the importance of the name) plays a chess game against Hector, which is controlled by Benson. Hector makes a move and Adam asks why he did that. Benson replies; to exchange and simplify which is the idea of machine and artificial intelligence replacing human, making them obsolete. The exchange also accounts for the exchange of Benson with Hector, where his mind is mixed with Hectors mechanic body. Then Adam makes a winning move to the surprise of Hector and Benson - a sacrifice, foretelling the ending of the film. Sacrifice is something that cant be taught to machines says Adam. The only shortcomings of the film may be some poor special effects such as the landing of the spacecraft on the moons surface and some very obvious miniatures. May be with a higher budget this could be turned into an all time classic. I would be pleased also to see an extended version. All in all this is a great film which never received the praise it deserves.

That said, the sets that take a leaf from Alien (1979) are partially effective and the blue ominous lighting works but is sadly used sparingly.The late Farrah Fawcett is still a major draw and although there's a cringe worthy age gap between leads it is fitting to the narratives themes. Acting legend Kirk Douglas is a little inconsistent and not on form possibly due to the script or production woes. Harvey Keitel has been unconventionally re-dubbed which is a shame, but he still is effective as the homicidal sociopath, off beat, boorish Earth Captain Benson. Although choppy, there's some great setups with the interestingly designed Hector robot and Elmer Bernstein's score if fantastic. It's not purposely ambiguous, but it leaves many questions and loose ends. It's by no means the worst science-fiction movie, John Barry's story offers some great ideas and has clearly influenced subsequent scifi's notably the Matrix (1999) plug-in.It's flawed and inconsistent but still worth viewing for the concept alone.

She was just coming off the enormous success of Charlie's Angels and every young girl was copying her hair style. This was her chance for a career in feature films.Then, too, I can understand why Kirk Douglas is in this movie. He was in his mid-60s and although he looked fine and retained his talent, fewer offers were coming his way.But what is Harvey Keitel doing in this movie, made up like Bette Midler and dubbed throughout? He was at his peak, yet here he is, inexpressive, lacking in tonality, and more robotic than the android he creates. What a waste.The story, by Martin Amis, son of the sophisticated Kingsley, borrows from Silent Running, 2001, and Alien, but at heart it's a clumsy respinning of Forbidden Planet. Instead of Morpheus and his pretty daughter on a lonely planet, we have Kirk Douglas and Farrah Fawcett living comfortably together on Saturn 3, an isolated outpost on one of Saturn's moons. Their mission is to grow plants hydroponically to help feed earth's population.Instead of their torpid existences being disturbed by a visit from Leslie Nielsen and his crew, they are visited by Keitel, who has brought with him a robot to help them on Saturn 3, and once the robot is working, one of the loving couple will become obsolete.So far, so good. But then Keitel, with his phony voice, develops a yen for Farrah Fawcett. You have a beautiful body, he tells her. May I use it? And why not? Douglas has his signature chin dimple but Fawcett has her appealing attributes too. We get a brief glimpse of both of them as she sheds her robe preparatory to playing doctor with Douglas. This was a disturbing scene indeed because there is no evidence that they are married, so I'm afraid their congress is improper.I don't want to go on with the rest of this nonsense. It's not really worth this space or your time. The robot goes berserk, as robots representing the id are wont to do, and begins to bust some moves on Fawcett. I don't blame this freaky looking machine for having the impulse, but what on earth, or on Saturn 3, can its intentions be? The climax involves a plodding chase through the internal tubes -- all lighted with neon blue -- with Douglas and Fawcett running and the robot plodding like Schwarzenegger's humanoid in The Terminator. There is a moment of self sacrifice. Fawcett gets to visit the earth for the first time in her life.

Saturn 3 at least tried to do something different. Dressed in science fiction trimmings, Saturn 3 tried to give us a claustrophobic, adult, thriller.The adult elements merit comment. The film certainly starts in shocking style with a gruesome killing. And, as it goes on, there is occasional nudity. Plus, thematically, it is dark, with violence always hanging round the corner. And there are two menacing villains one, the impassive, unreadable android Hector and, two, the always worrying Harvey Keitel (Keitel plays someone who is probably off-balance behind a veneer of normality so well, that you expect it even when he is playing comedy).As the protagonists, Kirk Douglas and Farrah Fawcett make a strange couple, living in an idyll of isolation featuring occasional work and frequent sex. It is exactly the sort of part one might have expected Fawcett to play at this stage in her career it is exactly not the sort of part one might have expected of Douglas.Taking a step back and looking at the piece overall, the science fiction trimmings are fine, but the drama itself is, dare one say it, a bit stodgy. It turns out to be quite difficult to build any sort of emotional identification for Douglas and Fawcett and, as the film progresses (rather slowly) towards its denouement, this turns out to be a fatal flaw.

This is a great LOOKING film, albeit a somewhat underdeveloped one. It might have been nice had we gotten to know the characters a little bit better, so our rooting interest could be stronger.Kirk Douglas and Farrah Fawcett play Adam and Alex, two lovers working in an underground space station on Saturns' third moon, Titan. Their job is to try to develop new foods for an underfed Planet Earth. Then along comes the unstable Captain Benson (Harvey Keitel), who makes life miserable for the two of them. For one thing, he quickly begins lusting after Alex (but who can blame him?) and, when he builds a giant helper robot named Hector (!), he is able to transfer his thoughts into Hectors' brain matter. So what we end up with is a terminator with a sex drive.One of the most curious details is hearing actor Roy Dotrices' voice coming out of Keitels' mouth. This situation - could one consider it a sexual *rectangle*? - is enough to make this at least somewhat memorable. It's a fairly trim film at a mere 88 minutes in length, and it gets down to business with some rapidity. Hector himself is humanoid in shape but still very much a mechanical, and his design is amusing. Kirk and Farrah make for an unlikely but somewhat appealing couple.

Soon Adam finds himself in quite the predicament because Benson considers the Major an obsolete old timer in the way of his plans to supply the Earth with the food sources from Saturn's moon necessary for that planet's survival. Anyway, the film soon consists of the robot attacking or chasing everyone, including Benson(who was playing with fire to begin with for he hadn't quite read up on what to do if the machine needs to be silenced when enraged)with Adam needing to figure out how to stop the blasted thing.Ambitious, but cold, dull & life-less. It's derivative of many sci-fi pictures, particularly Kubrick's 2001, but doesn't have good enough special effects or space-ship interiors(or exteriors for that matter)to compete with other far more entertaining, mind-blowing fare. It hurts that the film is completely miscast with Douglas, good as always, but does not belong in this genre. He's always great at playing heroic types, but inside this very uninspired plot Douglas has very little to accomplish. Fawcett is a stunning beauty, but she's merely a pretty mannequin because she is completely wooden. Keitel should've fired his agent for even reading the script for he is sleepwalking something fierce here. And, the most sad statement of all..Stanley Donen, of all people, directed this rehash. Pretty sad, really. And the idea of having a lust-sick robot on the rampage as your main plot is pretty laughable. We, at least, briefly see Fawcett's amazing rack..she is quite the lovely creature.

I, however, view this as one of the best B-movies of the '80s, rather than as one of the worst star-studded films.  Kirk Douglas, Farrah Fawcett, and Harvey Keitel all turn in credible performances, and Keitel's role as the psycho is especially memorable.  The fabulous robot used in the movie is one of the most convincing ever filmed, as well as one of the most evil-looking.  While certain shots, most notably those from outside the base, allow the movie's low budget to become obvious, I think this is a terrific film for what it aspired to be.  It is a great tale of desolation, jealousy, and rage as experienced in the bleak future of mankind.

Soon Benson, who's posing as Captain James, joins them and he has brought along components of a robot called Hector. He can control its actions with his brain, as he can be connected to it with a device in the back of his neck. Though his lustful feelings for Alex and psychotic intentions, infects Hector and causes it to go berserk.Danger, danger! What could have been a Sci-fi film brimming with ambitious ideas, turns out to be a increasingly derivative story that just never gets off the ground and languishes in its uneventfully bonkers premise. It occasionally gets quite nasty and sleazy, but never goes anywhere with this voyeuristic touch to make you squirm. Instead this is given pretty risible treatment. If you going to make something this dumb, it better be shamelessly fun when it finally goes haywire. Honestly for me, that didn't occur much. It takes its sweet time to build up the situation, after watching the characters lounging about aimlessly and eyeing each other off. There's just too much time to kill, as there's little to no suspense generated. From a guy who has done some light-hearted movies (Singing in the Rain, Lucky Lady and Bedazzled), director Stanley Donen didn't seem to adjust to the material. He went fishing for the thrills in a very unfulfilling manner and slack pacing eventuated from it too.What kept me watching were the impressive images in this technically well-made enterprise. The imaginative set pieces and overall design are vividly detailed that you could see where most of the money gone too. The special effects also were exemplary staged and especially convincing. Hector the randy robot is one ominous creation and this showers the dreary air. A broodingly understated music score was integrated successfully and the polish photography had a muggy tinge to it as its filmed in such dour lighting. It's lavished A-grade production values stuck in a cheesy B-grade format. The main influence for this would be the soddenly dire script that spits out some dreadful dialogues. The flimsy story is weakly drawn up as it's filled with baffling intentions and abrupt plot-holes. A fine cast isn't given a whole lot to do. Kirk Douglas floats by in very little effort and might be the film's slight energy. Scary, since how old was he? A lot of the interest arose from his performance. Harvey Keitel sounds unrecognizable and is plain deadpan in delivery. As for Farrah Fawcett, she's totally lacking in her acting skills here and provides a child-like innocence to her part. I guess on this occasion we're only supposed to drool over this benchmark 70s pinup girl.It has some minor moments, but this mostly cold and uninspired shocker doesn't get up to too much trouble.

Watchable enough Sci-Fi horror film.","Date":"12 May 2005","Score":"5 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" Saturn 3 starts just like Star Wars (1977) with a shot of space in which a giant spacecraft slowly enters the top of the frame & flies 'over' the camera. Onboard Captain James (an uncredited Douglas Lambert) prepares to depart in a small spacecraft when a mysterious spacesuit & helmet wearing person named Benson (Harvey Keitel, hideously dubbed throughout by Roy Dotrice) opens an airlock & blasts the Captain into some protective wires which make him explode. This impostor takes the place of the Captain & leaves on his own for one of the moons of Saturn. Once there Benson lands in an experimental food research station called Saturn 3. There are only two people who live on Saturn 3, reclusive lover's Adam (Kirk Douglas) & Alex (Farrah Fawcett). It seems that Adam & Alex are making slow progress with their work so Earth has sent the first of the Demigod series of robots lovingly named Hector to help assist them in their research & hopefully speed things up a bit. At first Hector is in pieces, but it doesn't take long for Benson to screw him together & for the fun to start. Hector has the ability to learn directly from Benson, Benson has a special device implanted into the back of his neck which leads to his brain & Hector is able to absorb Benson's thoughts & personality through this device, or something like that. Unfortunately since Benson is a liar, murderer & a mentally unstable drug user Hector starts to develop some worrying personality traits from him. Including an unhealthy obsession with Alex, eventually Hector goes completely berserk & decides that nothing or nobody will stop him from achieving his slightly distorted orders. To make matters even worse Saturn 3 has just entered a 22 day eclipse & cannot contact anyone until they come out of it...Saturn 3 is one of those films with a troubled production history, John Barry started the film as director but was either fired or left depending on who you believe & the films producer Stanley Donen took over & completed the filming. I quite liked Saturn 3, it isn't brilliant but it wasted an hour and twenty minutes painlessly enough. The script by Martin Amis is not without it's problems, for most of the film there are only three human characters in it. Saturn 3 could have done with a few more disposable cast members for Hector to kill. Benson's motives are almost totally ignored, why kill Captain James & go to Saturn 3 anyway? About two thirds of the way through Hector kills him before he says anything to suggest why is is there, some of Benson's other actions throughout the film were also a bit of a mystery to me. How could Benson pass himself off as Captain James so easily? I was also confused about Hector's motives, what were his eventual plans for Saturn 3, Adam, Alex & why? Some of the dialogue is a little silly as well. The taking of drugs is mentioned but not tackled in a serious way as is the pollution of Earth. The 'Trivia' section on the IMDb states that Saturn 3 only has music during the opening & closing credits, well I can tell you now that I watched it mere hours ago & although the music is used sparingly in Saturn 3 it is scored throughout by Elmer Bernstein. I would also like to mention the sound effects at this point as they really got on my nerves, every time something happened there was an annoying exaggerated electrical sound like when Hector walks or does something, when a door opens or shuts or just operating a computer. The part of Saturn 3 which stands out is the production design & sets which are very impressive, Saturn 3 obviously had a fair amount of money spent on it's overall look. The deranged robot, Hector, looks quite good even if it's head is rather stupid in appearance & it's obviously just a poor actor encased in a robotic suit. It's just a shame he didn't get to do more, preferably killing people. Some of the spacecraft in Saturn 3 look extremely silly, impractical & are obviously just plastic models. The special optical effects are OK, they're not great but they are just about acceptable without becoming too distracting. The acting isn't that great, Douglas looks a little bit old for the role, the best thing I can say about Fawcett is that she's pretty to look at & Keitel complete with pony-tail is dubbed throughout so his original performance is lost. There is a brief nude scene with Fawcett, forget about any gore or violence as all we get a severed hand, a dead dog & a novel use of a decapitated head. Saturn 3 is generally well made & has a reasonable polish to it, nothing stands out as being particularly brilliant but at the same time nothing stands out as being particularly bad. Overall I found Saturn 3 to be an OK way to spend 85 odd minutes, with a bit more thought in the script it could have been really good. As it is it's average at best, watch it if there's nothing else to do.

Still, having come back to it after so long, I was expecting to be greatly disappointed but actually I enjoyed it for what it is as a sci-fi epic, it certainly brought nothing new to the table (borrowing the plot's essential life-on-a-space-station element from SILENT RUNNING 1971 and its sex-starved robot, an appropriately menacing creation, from DEMON SEED 1977) but was nonetheless fairly engaging - with a stylish enough look courtesy of cinematographer Billy Williams and production designer Stuart Craig (though Elmer Bernstein's score is curiously forgettable) - and, thankfully, did not overstay its welcome (running for only 88 minutes).Even so, the two leads - who actually ended up Razzie nominees, as did the film! - weren't exactly inspired (Douglas, by this time, was past his prime and, unfortunately, his stint in the sci-fi/horror genre - which also comprised HOLOCAUST 2000 1977; the only one I've yet to catch up with, though it's been shown on Italian TV quite a few times, THE FURY 1978 and THE FINAL COUNTDOWN 1980 - is best forgotten!) but, at least, Harvey Keitel brought to it his typical intensity and intelligence - though I'm sure it's a film he'd rather forget. Speaking of which, I recall an article in the British film magazine Empire comparing the fortunes of Keitel and Robert De Niro over the years in the same year Keitel appeared in SATURN 3, De Niro reached his pinnacle with RAGING BULL, but a dozen or so years later the tables would be more or less turned...but that's another story.In the end, one has to wonder what Stanley Donen was thinking when he accepted such a project - but, then, his career had always been somewhat erratic (including at least a couple more notorious false steps with the homosexual two-hander STAIRCASE 1969 and the bootlegging comedy LUCKY LADY 1975).

Saturn 3 is a British rip off of Alien starring Kirk Douglas and Fawcett as lovers working on the 3rd moon of Saturn which is invaded by a deranged scientist and his robotic creation; Hector. The special effects are competent and the sets are interesting enough to hold your attention but the deadly robot lacks menace and appears stiff and unconvincing. Saturn 3 should have been a lot better and more successful than it was. It's a gorgeous looking film and Fawcett was a media sensation. The problem is the casting choice of Kirk Douglas as the male lead. At nearly 60, his nude scenes boarder on repulsive and cancel out the natural sex appeal Fawcett brings to the part. If the point was to feature the white hot Ms Fawcett the premise was torpedoed by negating it with the completely unappealing Mr Douglas. It's an empty headed adventure that should please fans of the genre.

Remember, in space no one can hear you scream...Saturn 3 was produced and directed by Stanley Donen, better known for his colorful musicals, who saw it as a Frankenstein story in space. The story came from John Barry, who had done production design for such films as A Clockwork Orange, Star Wars and Superman. He initially passed the story to Donen's wife who passed it to Stanley, but Barry ended up being a co-director of sorts.The cast, consisting of only three people, is pure star power. Kirk's role was originally for Sean Connery, but Connery passed because he was hiding out in Spain to avoid taxes. And this was during Keitel's low period, after his work with Scorsese and revival thanks to Quentin Tarantino. For some odd reason, he is entirely dubbed. People are bound to seek this one out just to see some of their favorite stars.I cannot even begin to say how disappointed I was by this. Science fiction is a fun genre, and this is an all-star cast with a hugely successful director. There is no way this should have gone wrong, but it totally did. What should have been suspense turned into a slower, dragging tedium.There is so much potential here, and you have to admit the set designer and special effects crew did a top notch job. For a late 1970s science fiction film, they had everything at their disposal to make this a blockbuster. This same robot used in a different way could be incredible... but no.The film lost money at the box office, and the critics were not too kind, either. Roger Ebert gave the film a measly single star and wrote the story is so dumb it would be laughed out of any junior high school class in the country.The Scream Factory Blu-ray features audio commentary with fan Greg Moss and film critic David Bradley, and is extraordinarily informative.

Saturn 3 is also quite a dark movie, falling more into the genre of sci-fi horror than just a straight up space movie. Harvey Keitel's character is murderous and nasty, which we see early in the movie, while his robot creation is pure evil. Mr Keitel tries to introduce Farrah's character to hallucinogenic drugs and steal her innocence, while attempting the whole time to compete with Kirk Douglas for her affections.

For one, `Saturn 3' has some truly stunning visuals (and I'm not just talking about the brief shot of Farrah's perfect breast); some wry commentary of the dehumanization of people as a result of modern technology and overpopulation; excellent lighting, cinematography, art direction and music; and the simulated demonstration of  inserting a metallic occipital probe for direct neural connection SOME 20 YEARS BEFORE `THE MATRIX'.  WARNING  SPOILER AHEADIt would have been nice to have a logical storyline and an ending that really made some kind of point. Ending the movie after Douglas' sacrifice would have made as much sense as showing Farrah at the space station on the way to earth.  Sure Farrah said earlier she wanted to visit for the first time, but big deal.

Well I think those things would have helped anyways.One more thing, for an insane, murdering captain Kietel sure fights like a little girl.Kirk took him down in 2 seconds.Then we had to see a naked Kirk for 2 seconds.Uggg, and thats twice as long as we see naked Farah.

What's most unsettling in all this is, unlike the underrated Demon Seed, the mechanical rape is used not to illustrate the nature of violation, but merely used as a narrative plot device. Of course, Douglas and Fawcett are so insipid you spend the whole of the film wishing they would get wiped out, as painfully as possible.The robot, Hector, is actually quite effective, though the voyages through Saturn's rings have to be seen to be ... laughed at. I don't know what's the worst part of this film &#150; the exteriors that are clearly studio sets, or Keitel getting his hand chopped off, an obvious hand up the sleeve trying to convince while a rubber appendage skittles across the floor.Ultimately, you have to ask questions, such as why does Keitel join the Saturn 3 team in the first place? What's his motivation? Why are the performances so sterile? Why did Douglas (then 63) allow that shot of his wobbly rear end? Saturn 3 is an appallingly made film, and you cannot imagine why the cast agreed to be in it. The script is awful, the direction clipped and static, but best of all... it's great fun! Some turkeys are bores, others are pretentious, some repulsive, but Saturn 3 is so enjoyably poor it makes for compulsive viewing. A must-watch into one of the very worst science fiction films of all time, it's absolutely essential. 4/10.

They will also have a handy 'detonate' button which will somewhat pointlessly destroy the adjacent landing pad. -Everything in the future, from doorways to computer read-outs to the very planets themselves, makes a noise. Moreover, robots make breathing sounds when lurking about (4102) and emit a sort of squeal when humans throw plastic buckets at them (10132). In fact, they will continue to make such noises even as they are blown to smithereens. -If a robot chops your hand off, it is immediately fatal.Okay, we could go on (and on), but the fact is that this is an utterly daft cartoon of a movie, and probably is best approached as such. The casting is weird, to say the least. Kirk Douglas seems bemused, Harvey Keital is hammy, and for the role of Alex the research scientist, Farrah Fawcett just does her patented 'breathy-voiced sexy innocent' persona (complete with little-girl sulky pouts) one more time. Possibly the least convincing cinematic portrayal of a research scientist, ever. The effects and model-work are pretty threadbare even for 1980, and the movie's ending is irksomely underwhelming, to boot. As for the monster, well it's a great big ungainly bipedal robot with an anglepoise lamp for a head which clumps slowly and largely non-scarily about the moonbase supposedly lusting after Farrah. He certainly isn't after her for her brains. Anyway, all of that notwithstanding, Saturn 3 is entertaining enough, albeit as a great example of 'bad sci-fi'. It's basically a cornball 1950s-style monster movie; all the DVD cover needs is an illustration of the robot holding a swooned Farrah in its evil arms.

The shots of Saturn and interstellar bodies were ethereal and believable &#x96; I couldn't help but be reminded of the similar shot of Saturn from 'The Quiet Earth,' and they're nearly on par. The designs of the bug ship, green jumpsuits, and decon chamber were also good. The model work, however, particularly that of the gold-colored moon base and the red & white spaceship featured at the end, were laughable. As this film is post-Star Wars, this is an even greater faux pas. Furthermore, the effects from Silent Running (1972) nearly a decade before give Saturn 3 a run for its money. The robot itself is alright by B-movie standards, which isn't saying much.2. Alex & Adam. It's probably just me, but I wasn't bothered by the campiness of their performances. They seemed to genuinely care for one another, and Alex's loyalty to Adam and her rebuffs of the stoic Benson just made their relationship (which was never to last long anyway) all the more poignant. If I were in Alex's shoes, hell, I'd go for the major too.3. Benson. Cue stilted, unnatural dialogue. *facepalm* 4. Costumes. Whoever was in charge of this really outdid themselves, considering some of the outlandish and distracting sci-fi space outfits we've been subjected to for decades. From the green suede uniforms and spacesuits, right down to the semi-formal and casual wear that Adam and Alex sport, all the clothes were practical and of realistic, earth tone colors. They didn't scream Look at us &#x96; we're wearing clothes from the future! Little of it looked dated to my eyes. Alex's perm is another matter.By the way, the recurring circular badge for the space flight program was a nice graphic design.5. Story. The kernel of a good tale is in there somewhere, but definitely needed more background and more screen development. Random bits of dialogue (e.g. The Earth is Hungry, abort time) were mysterious and thought provoking, but a little more development in order to fully grasp this world, and what happened to the Earth, would be nice.I've always thought that the movies deserving of a remake should be those that weren't successful the first time around.

What I saw was interesting and intrigued me sufficiently to see the movie when it came out on video (VHS) back in the disco 70's era. Recently, I rented a DVD copy of the film and I've experienced it from a completely new viewpoint. I'm seeing it at 58 years of age after a recent corporate downsizing and one of film's themes, obsolescence, strikes a bull's eye with me. The film is laced with such references. Dialogue such as then one of you will be obsolete and abort time are examples. Kirk Douglas was about 54 years old when this film was shot. His own career was just starting to wind down so aging and obsolescence of his character must have struck pretty close to home.S3 is also the typical man against machine film.

Probably the most amazing thing about it was how they got Kirk Douglas to sign on. Farrah I could see and Harvey Keitel wasn't much of a name back then, but it was surprising seeing him playing a scientist with a ponytail.Beyond that was mucho serious absurdity that should have been cleared up in the planning stages before the script was even settled on.  Kirk and Alex (Farrah) are a seemingly happy May-December couple for *some* reason living with their dog on a base on one of Saturn's moons, for *some* reason growing hydroponic food for Earth.  (Wouldn't the moon have been closer?)Everybody addresses each other with military titles but carries on like civilians, and only Harvey Keitel seems to be bent on *some* mission to replace one of the crew with his robot that has human brains to run it and needs a lot of maintenance and tinkering.  Harvey immediately and bluntly chases after Farrah, with probably one of the most inane come-on lines in history, and is actually surprised that she didn't willingly offer himself to him.  Supposedly Harvey represents whatever culture has degraded to on Earth, while Farrah acts as if she was born and raised in outer space, (many jokes come to mind on that) and Kirk just seems plain happy to be living with Farrah.  She may be pretty and sweet, but the appeal of living with someone slightly brighter than a floor lamp has to wear off eventually....The rest of the story is jealousy and the usual psychotic robot, spaceship that for *some* reason has a detonate button on it, running around the same three corridors that make up the base, and so on.  One quick flash of skin (two if you count Kirk) and one moment of gore is about all that separates this from a high budget TV movie of the week.The only real recommendation to see this movie is how silly bad the robot looks.  The lower half is an overdone clanking metal man with muscles sculpted into the panels, (Why? All they do is cover the cables and wires!) but the chest grows into a giant block about three times normal size atop of which are perched two skinny robot arms and a head consisting of two pointy lights.

These reviews are always favorable. I suspect that these members' recent viewings are tinged with nostalgia. At any rate, here's a review based on an adult's first viewing.Much of this review focuses on the means used to bring the film's main physical threat, a robot named Hector, to the screen. This stems from the fact that the entire second half of Saturn 3 is a simple monster movie Hero saves passive woman from monster. Hero and passive woman run from monster. Hero kills monster. For any of this to be worth your time, the monster has to be scary. Hector--a pencil-necked, wobbling, clumsy, slow-coach stunt-guy-in-a-suit--is not scary.Saturn 3's budget woes are well-documented. While they don't show up in its cast or set design, they do betray themselves in other ways. The biggest single problem is Hector. Hector is a guy in a robot suit. It's a cumbersome suit, tricked out with fluid-filled surgical tubes and rigid metal plates. In an ineffective attempt to persuade viewers that it isn't a guy in a suit, the suit's designers built up its shoulders so high that they enveloped the guy's head. They then stuck Hector's own head atop it. The head is an extremely fragile concoction, with two light-bulb eyes at the end of a miniature desk lamp arm. It's so fragile that, when it moves, the whole assembly shakes unevenly.Unfortunately, this means that when the script calls for the monster to stare, frighteningly, at the audience, the camera must zoom in on this stupid, fragile head and lavish attention on it. And that, my friends, is a giggle-inducing moment. It undercuts any remaining credibility this robot has as a threat. Instead, it establishes Hector as a pencil-necked geek. Through the rest of the film, whenever I saw Kirk Douglas struggling for his life with Hector. I wondered Why don't you just reach up and snap Hector's tiny little neck? He'll be left blind, and you can hunt him down at your leisure.We have plenty of time to wonder about this, because Hector is slooowww. That's because, after all, he's a guy in a cumbersome robot suit. Moreover, it's clear that Hector's mind isn't the only thing that's dangerously unbalanced; the suit is on the verge of toppling over more than once.By the time Kirk Douglas sacrifices himself to destroy Hector, you're so distant from the story that you notice, immediately, that he didn't need to kill himself in order to pull off the trick that kills Hector. It's a trope designed to manipulate the audience, divorced from reason and bereft of emotional impact.My score of 3/10 reflects Kirk Douglas' reliable work and the rather good set design. The sets are very effective in evoking a dark and claustrophobic mood, and with their vein-like tubes they quite plausibly represent a biological research station carved from lunar rock. The missing seven points are due to the risible robot, Harvey Keitel's wooden acting (perhaps aggravated by his unknown dubber), and shoddy visual effects (even for the period). To be fair, the VFX serve only to establish locations; but this _is_ science fiction. VFX are part of the draw, and they need to be at least serviceable.

It was amusing to witness a 63-year-old Kirk Douglas kick butt and save the day. A class actor like Harvey Keitel is wasted in this film, and sure will try and forget his role in a movie which proved unsuccessful at the box office.Farrah Fawcett had abandoned Charlie's Angels in 1977 after just one season to better herself as an actress and move into the world of movies. But in 1978 and 1979, Fawcett was struggling, appearing in unmemorable features which film goers ignored, Saturn 3 being another failure. Although stunningly beautiful, Fawcett doesn't take her role as Alex in any particular direction, and seems just like your typical scared easily blonde (sorry no offence intended really!), but this time stranded in space! These three stars are the only characters in the film (unless you count the robot of course). It's just as well because the script is hardly memorable, and the special effects leave a lot to be desired. Stanley Donen tries hard to prove himself a superior director in the sci-fi genre, but his time and effort was simply wasted; Saturn 3 fails. This was filmed the same year as Alien, and Ridley Scott's effort has gone down as one of the best films of all time. If you had to choose between the two, there really is no contest. Saturn 3 tries to mimic Alien in a sense, but fails to raise suspense, and that is its biggest downfall.I'm a fan of Farrah Fawcett in her career following Charlie's Angels, but this film is certainly not a highlight in that career. 3/10 "},{"Title":"Warning!

Not only is she just weird in this movie and not really attractive, Kirk Douglas shows his bare a$$, its nasty! They really need to have a warning for that, I'm still recovering.I love entertainingly bad movies, which is what this movie is, and at first glance, you may notice the all-star cast of Farah Fawcett, Harvey Kietel, and Kirk Douglas, but these are the only 3 people in the movie! Only 3 actors, and one main set. Kirk Douglas is just ugly, clearly he took this role to show he was still a leading man, yes, he may be in shape at 64 years old (which is how old he was when this was made) but its creepy! He looks like skeletor, and Farah Fawcett, literally 30 years younger than him, plays a doe eyed dumb blonde that is incapable of being anything but helpless. She act like a much younger woman in this movie, and I don't know how these actors could stay in character its so disgusting.The dog getting killed, Harvey Kietel's hand being chopped off are part of the fun gore that is in this movie, and the robot is clearly the most convincing actor of the movie, at about 45 minutes in you'll realize there just isn't too much to this movie - after Kietel's character is killed off, that just leaves the two creepy ugly idiots in love (fawcett and douglas) to run from the robot for the rest of the movie.

The technology was interesting and morbid, the huge spaceship with giant claws at its stern that could've been launch/landing bays or maybe grapplers, Benson's spacepod looked like an unholy mating of a big black spider and a viperfish, Hector at least looked more technologically realistic than some cyborgs with all those transparent liquid-filled tubes of different fluids necessary to sustain biological life but his microphone-stand head was stupid. The stick-probe-in-your-brain learning device was definitely creepy. I wish they had gone into a little more detail about Earths hunger problem, exactly what a dead cell is, and why people who haven't been/can't goto Earth are branded on their foreheads. Farrah has one very brief nude scene where you see one breast for about 2 seconds. Adam's bare ass I did not need to see. Strange that people can be flushed into space so easily without setting off any alarms. When Hector got horny the movie went downhill fast. My favorite quote, He's not so cuckoo.

This was the synopsis digital cable gave me, but I went ahead and watched it anyway.Um, yeah, truly a very very bad movie.  One of those films that just fails in every aspect possible; acting, effects, script, sets.  And the coup de grace in my book, the pointless killing of a dog.  And it's a shame, because the dog was the only decent actor in the flick.  I truly believed that it WAS a dog.  Unlike scientist Farrah Fawcett, or whatever the hell Keitel was supposed to be.  At first, with his wooden portrayal and monotone, I thought HE was the robot and maybe Douglas would be the madman. Also none of the actors seemed to be working together, it was almost as if each person was shot separately reading their insipid lines, and then with the magic of 1980s Parent Trap technology, spliced together for the finished product.  I bet they never even met each other in person.  The high point was Fawcett's nude scenes, but the movie wouldn't even let us have that without showing Kirk Douglas's old man butt.  They give with one hand, and punch us in the jimmy with the other. The shoddy acting is enhanced, that is to say made shoddier, by a script so threadbare, they let Fawcett wear it in one of the bedroom scenes (shudder).  The words were just there to fill space between the actors who were talking to themselves.  This was by no stretch of the imagination a cerebral pick...it pretty much was madman and robot chase couple in space. In a time where you had films like the Black Hole or even 2001, you kinda wanted more from a sci-fi, and Saturn 3 offered nothing but intense stomach cramps and volatile flatulence. We know it is the future and space due to the presence of brightly colored tubes framing all the sets.  What is it about tubes that imparts that feeling of future advancement to crappy set designers?  My guess, cheapass to procure.  The remainder of the sets were just black soundstages with the occasional pipe and metal grid floor.  I mean, when even the sets anger you, you know it's gonna be a bad movie. And let's not forget effects.  The robot Hector...i mean come on..ABS?? Why would a robot need abs?  And the head is just one of those robot arms with two christmas lights for eyes...why sculpt the abs and then give it no head?  It's pretty obviously a dude in a suit with a robot arm on his head. And when I say madman and robot chase, I think pursue is a better word, as there's little fast movement where this robot is concerned.  Again, costumes and spaceship models anger me in such a non-specific way that I believe it's my hatred for this movie spreading like a cancer through all areas of production...worst gaffing i've ever seen, and the catering was pretentious and tasteless...cough...All in all, a very bad movie...good for whatever bad movies are good for.

Once there however, things get ugly when the robot's mind becomes polluted by Benson's thoughts & tries to have its way with the female scientist working there.Film Review When ALIEN came out during the sci-fi boom of the very late 1970s / early 1980s, Stanley Donen (a director who specialised in light musicals) took over a trouble-ridden project & turned it into one of the biggest critical flops that 1980 has ever seen. Since then, Saturn 3 has become a minor cult favourite for fans of Farrah Fawcett.The film's plot &#x96; loony space pilot flies to a remote outpost, starts having fantasies about the local babe & struggles to contain his insanity with a robot (which is technically a cyborg due to its organic brain) that is psychically connected to his brain &#x96; is quite interesting but quickly collapses into pretentiousness due to a script that runs over everything with a Biblical overtone that makes the whole thing unintentionally hilarious.The best thing about the film is the visual effects. Saturn 3 has had a whole heap of money thrown at it & it shows, with some impressive spaceship miniatures, nice sterile uniforms & a lab complex that has been built around an entire soundstage. If only the script had the same budget as the production&#x85;The acting is another problem. Kirk Douglas & Harvey Keitel don't do much to stand out in their roles &#x96; in fact they seem to have a contest over who can underplay the most. Fawcett displays the same spectacular air-headed idiocy that critics at the time thought was an once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to savage with their scathing critique. The best acting by far in this turkey belongs to the robot, who proves to be a real scene-stealer, whether by displaying unsportsmanlike behaviour after losing a game of chess, tearing apart the station's resident pooch (probably saving it from Keitel's appetite &#x96; they eat dogs where he comes from) & lusting after Fawcett.The film has had a bad time at the box office, only managing to draw some really negative reviews upon its release.

I have read so many unfair reviews that I needed to speak out, so I'll try to give you a detailed analysis of this interesting piece of Sci-Fi.THE FILM ITSELF. Obviously the producers of SATURN 3 wanted to cash in the then current craze on Sci-Fi movies that STAR WARS and subsequently ALIEN helped launch. The film deals with a food research lab on Saturn's third moon (hence the title). Two food research scientists (Adam, played by Kirk Douglas and Alex, played by Farrah Fawcett)and their pet dog live all alone in an isolated space station full of weird corridors. They are working on alternatives to food, to feed earth's hungry. But the company they work for decides they need more help and send in Captain James, not before being torn to pieces by wacko peer Benson (Harvey Keitel), who takes the Captain's identity and flies to Saturn 3. With him, he carries several cargo loads of what appears to be a dismantled robot plus a container holding what looks like piles and piles of brains. Right from the start, Captain James behaves strangely and rapidly develops an obsession for Alex. But Alex is doing fine with his fellow science AND bed partner Adam, even if he looks like he were her father. Captain James the proceeds to assemble HECTOR, the robot he brought with him. HECTOR is the 1st of the demigod series, an advanced cyborg capable of learning human logic by means of direct input.To make this part of the review shorter, HECTOR also develops an obsession for Alex, since he is being programmed by demented Captain James. In a short while, Captain James and his robot go berserk and unleash mayhem on Saturn 3.THE ACTING. If you think Keanu Reeves is a wooden actor, you have to see Harvey Keitel here. The veteran actor in one of his earlier movies acts as a lifeless man. To make matters worse, his voice was overdubbed and some of his lines are really annoying. It almost looks like he's THE robot, not HECTOR! And Farrah Fawcett's Alex is the living definition of a space bimbo. For a supposed scientist, she acts like a 12 year old girl. I don' know if this was intentional or if Mrs. Fawcett's acting skills at the time were limited. And Kirk Douglas just goes through the motions. Being older and supposedly wiser should have tipped him off at having a psycho in his space station.THE RATING. I'm a bit confused by the rating. There's more sex and violence on your typical PG rated JAMES BOND movie than on SATURN 3. Hell! Even RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK is way gorier. As for the sex, we see more skin in TITANIC that on this one. There's small glimpse of Farrah Fawcett's right breast and you get to see Kirk Douglas' naked butt for 8 seconds. That's all the sex you get. There's no profanity. There are no F words or any obscene remarks. On the violence side, there are only 3 or 4 blood related scenes. We get to see a man blown to pieces when he is sucked into space, an amputation, a decapitation and squashed animal. Not too gruesome (except for 2 scenes). The sex was always more implied than visual.THE MUSIC. Elsewhere here it says that Bernstein wrote 44 minutes of music and the only music we hear is a the beginning and at the end. WRONG. The score is pretty chilling. Combining classical with some weird synth sounds, Bernstain creates a pretty chilling score. It's an utter shame that there is no Soundtrack CD for this interesting score.THE ROBOT AND FX. HECTOR, the ominous killer robot is still a marvel to watch. It's not conventional in any way. Instead of having a proper head, like say, C-3PO, he has what appears to be a probe with two light bulbs as eyes and an antenna. His structural design implies some logic behind it and to this day, it remains one of my favorite film robots. As for the rest of the FX, some look extremely dated. Like the air close ups on the space station; they definitely look like a model. The ship at the beginning looks a bit weird and it will take you a while to figure out its shape. There are air ducts all over and the lighting on these halls is real neat. The Special Make up FX we see during the blowing up of the actual Captain James and the Decapitated head look realistic and well done. But the real star will always be the Robot, Hector. FINAL COMMENTS. Had this movie been directed by its actual intellectual creator, John Barry, it would have been probably one of the best Sci-Fi films of 1980. Remember that in that year, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK blew all other SF movies away, with only ALTERED STATES having something more interesting to offer mature audiences. It's a shame that Barry died soon after he was fired from HIS project. That's something that I'll never understand. SATURN 3 is in no way the worst SF movie ever. It certainly isn't among the best either, but THERE ARE others far worse. I hold this one dearly for nostalgic reasons but I know that it is not a perfect movie. The sadly Out of Print DVD is the only way you can see this movie again. It still angers me to see so much trash given DVD special edition treatment and other movies, such as this one, being totally ignored. SATURN 3 is still fun to watch and I'll say it again, HECTOR is really a cool looking robot, one of the best I've ever seen in a SF movie.

Farrah Fawcett and Harvey Keitel, however, are more in their element as both have done some terrible movies. You can safely assume they took these parts because, at the time, these may have been their best offers.Another interesting decision for the movie was the director, Stanly Donen, who had a long and respectable career doing mostly MGM musicals (such as Seven Brides for Seven Brothers). It's very surprising that they lured him into doing such an odd-ball picture. Maybe he, like Kirk Douglas, has a skeleton or two in his closet that they used to blackmail them into doing the movie (this is the only LOGICAL reason I can think of).Whatever the motivations, the story is about a strangely mismatched couple (Farrah and Kirk) who man a small space station. They are happy to be alone because it gives them a lot of time to dress and undress and dress and undress. I guess maybe Farrah being nude COULD be why Mr. Douglas chose to appear in the film. Hmm--maybe I CAN understand why he chose to do this film.Anyway, Harvey Keitel's character stumbles into the station. Given that it's the 1-dimensional Keitel, you can rightly assume that he is a slimy scumbag sociopath (that's pretty much all he's played since) and he wants to score with Farrah. Well, along the way he is killed and somehow implants his consciousness into a sex crazed robot who terrorizes both of our heroes.Gee, with a plot like that, it sure sounds like a surefire recipe for success (or at least giggles). As a comedy, it kinda works. You could laugh at Farrah's acting, the stupidity of the script or the excuses they come up with for the leads to take off their clothes. But, considering it is supposed to be straight sci-fi, it's a total mess.

Again and again there was, and still is, that fear of the machine to take over the human whether inside the man or outside him. The computer of (2001 Space Odyssey) was just the first bell, then why not to make the matter more understandable, dramatic, and commercial. So let's put that thinking robot (after making it lusty) in front of the sex symbol of the era, with some huge set and polished d√©cor; which looked eventually more appealing than the movie ! What exactly the problem was? I think mainly it's in the script.There are flashes of good points but with no depth. For example  did you notice how the ones whom had never been to earth (Fawcett and Douglas) were more human than the one who came from it ? (Keitel who's robotic all the way !). Did you notice how they, the human ones, were using the technology to make a happier cheaper life through new type of agriculture, and, on the other hand, how the one from earth was coming with a robot to terminate, coerce, be sexually crazy, and totally out of its advanced mind ?! Moreover, look at a robot that thinks by a human's mind to take the worst of it. It's some satire where we have a future with 3 types of creatures  good humans (simply because they're out of the bloody earth all the time) whom have awful thoughts sometimes, then a human who stopped being human anymore to be a savage machine, then the savage machine which's powerful than everybody however does not have the genuine human mark.. The capability to be humanitarian or humane, so no wonder that the victory at the end was for the man who got the choice and the power to sacrifice for others. WAW ! You can say how wonderful this story when you put it in fashionable space adventure, with elements of thriller, Horror, and a little bit of sex too. But the final result wasn't as good as the original intent.That script cared much about the sexual (not amusing) relationship between Fawcett and Douglas, to present nearly nothing about their motives or their history. Like a bad B-Grade Devil-in-our-home kind of usual flicks. That made them, with inharmonic charismas, as silly as the evil guy. Actually all what I drudged my brain for it previously is close to nonsexist, as for instance the whole first half seemed more like a good atmosphere for exotic porn !! Not to mention  some of the space's effects were poor. The music wasn't up to the (Elmer Bernstein)'s standard. While presenting scary mechanical voice, the matter of dubbed (Keitel) was overall annoying. (Farrah Fawcett) had such a sleepy presence; like she was (Marilyn Monroe) in the wrong place (I don't see her as a sex symbol in the first place !). In fact the script that didn't give her much to say or to do. They thought back then that her being nude (even briefly) with the old mighty Kirk Douglas being rarely nude too would be profitable, to be eventually gross.. Only ! And what a laugh when they made some of the set's corridors as low to watch Miss. Fawcett curving A LOT, in the time that she got no curves at all ??! There was a good irony in making the human lead old, with the heroine preferring him on the young dashing machine. There was another irony between a giant monster robot and its small head. But did they work through boring scenes, depthless treatment, and bad chemistry between all the cast?! I love (Stanley Donen) and all of his classic works, but many people just don't understand how Hollywood itself stopped producing that kind of classics at the time, so why not to handle an erotic space adventure with some meanings. He managed to make it so bright as all of his movies, and a bit intense but maybe not convincing enough, especially with script like this and a cast like that.(Saturn 3) is somehow an eye candy, a dark diverting show, a nostalgic memory, and a mediocre try to show us the vanquisher machine that could beat us if we forgot the human inside or outside us, even if he was that weak or fragile.
