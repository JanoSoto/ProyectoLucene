I agree that the characters are not as developed as they were in 'The Wrong Trousers' or 'A Close Shave' and also the plot is weaker.  Some of the models are not as refined as they came to be (this is after all the first W&G film).What it has that the other W&G offerings lack is that feeling of sadness and mood that the 'The Wrong Trousers' and 'A Close Shave' replace with story telling.  This is closer to Tom and Jerry than it is to Chicken Run.  It has laughs sure, but the feeling I have when the credits role is of one of wistfulness and a slight melancholy.  Not bad for 20 minutes of plasticine animation!See this Wallace and Gromit, then move onto the others asap.

How many stop motion animation films win Oscars, top the US and UK box office charts etc. But all that came later.A Grand Day Out was the first Wallace and Gromit film. Low budget. More or less a graduation piece. Of course the animation is less sophisticated than in the later films. Of course the plot is a little shallow. The entire story is designed to minimise the need for sophisticated animation and to maximise the excuse for shortcomings (perhaps dogs and people would move a bit like that on a cheese moon).Yet it is extraordinary to see how much of the Aardman genius is already there in this short film. Hilarious and clever references to other films. Mice in shades for take off. The rocket handbrake gag. Coin-operated machine gags (brilliantly recycled in Were-Rabbit BTW). And a machine (is it an Aga?) that daydreams about skiing when it sees Wallace's holiday magazines.Of course TWT, ACS and Were-Rabbit are better movies, but this film is so worth seeing as a sign of early genius and indeed in its own right as a crude but wonderful animated film.

The intricate craftsmanship is always excellent, and you can only imagine how long it must have taken to film even a second of the stop-motion animation. The humour is gentle and family-friendly, and also very British&#133; if that can serve as an adequate description. In this, the first film out of three directed by Nick Park &#150; not including the Oscar-winning feature length film of 2005 &#150; 'A Grand Day Out' is a genuinely entertaining 23 minutes of imagination and creativity, completed over six years by Park, who produced the film as part of his graduation project from the National Film and Television School.I have heard some remark that the animation in this film is poor, and yet I find myself wondering how they came to this conclusion. Of course, the work may not be as refined as the later additions to the series, given that Park was less experienced and was undoubtedly working on a smaller budget, but the quality is still never anything less than excellent. The story begins on a rather dull banking holiday, and the good-natured Wallace (voiced by Peter Sallis) is unsuccessfully trying to decide where he and his canine companion Gromit are to spend their day off. Suddenly, Wallace makes a horrifying discovery their house is completely devoid of dairy products! And so &#150; as anybody might do in such a situation &#150; the pair endeavour to travel to the Moon, which everybody knows is comprised of cheese.Wallace, being an enthusiastic inventor, casually tosses together a space rocket, and pretty soon they are ready for their big journey. In probably the film's most memorable sequence, Wallace realises, just as the launch countdown is beginning, that they forgot to bring the crackers. Imagine going to the Moon without crackers! However, some quick-thinking and agility from Wallace eventually saves the day, and the pair pass their otherwise uneventful Moon-ward journey by reading the newspaper and building delicate playing card pyramids. Their picnic on the lunar surface offers a hint of imaginative absurdity, with the main storyline concerning a coin-operated gas oven who lives on the Moon, writes out parking tickets and dreams of skiing.All this makes for a quirky, clever and humorous short film that literally anybody can enjoy. Interestingly, 'A Grand Day Out with Wallace and Gromit' was nominated for Best Animated Short at the 1991 Academy Awards, but failed to take the statue. I don't imagine, however, that Nick Park would have despaired; he lost out to a film called 'Creature Comforts'... directed by Nick Park!

What do you do when you realize that you've run out of cheese for your crackers. That's right. Go get some and combine with your annual holiday travel by picking the moon as the destination. After all, it's made all of cheese. Gromit's look to the camera says it all. But how did they get the cows up there? Anyway, watching this short film I had to think of French movie pioneer Georges Méliès' Trip to the Moon which shows quite a few parallels the planning, the rocket building and finally the flight from the inhabitants. This can't be a coincidence.After they reach the moon and we get to see a short gravity joke, they run into a cleaning robot, who's quickly fed up with tidying up after the mess Wallace leaves behind after testing different moon cheese culinary meals from several corners of the moon.

They're speciality was the almost lost art of stop-motion animation, particularly with claymation figures. They enjoyed some success with the amazing Peter Gabriel music video Sledgehammer, that was an eye-popper in its day. But the company really found its feet when novice animator Nick Park joined the studio.It was Park who would put the company on the map, and introduce two of the most endearing animated characters the world would ever see, Wallace & Gromit. The Wallace & Gromit world is a most peculiar one. Wallace is a scatterbrained inventor, always working on the next madcap invention. Gromit is his faithful dog, and much smarter than Wallace ever will be. With his incredibly expressive monobrow, he watches in silent dismay as Wallace's cock-ups get them into the wackiest adventures.Everyone of the Wallace & Gromit shorts has been a delight. So far we've seen the likes of a skiing oven, robotic trousers, a cyber-dog, a cereal killer, and with they're feature film debut, a Were-Rabbit. The films manage a perfect blend of laugh-aloud comedy and smart visual invention. My mouth always waters at the prospect of the next adventure.And A Grand Day Out is where it all began. Wallace and Gromit are lounging they're Bank Holiday away, but Wallace wants to go somewhere exotic. When there's not a piece of cheese in the house, Wallace on an impulse, decides to build a rocket ship, and fly to the Moon, where everybody knows, is a place paved with cheese. When they get there, they have to contend with a ski-obsessed oven/cooker, who won't leave them in peace.Even in they're debut, Wallace & Gromit and A Grand Day Out is a charming adventure. All of the things we would come to expect about them are plain to see, albeit in a slightly rougher, uncut form. They're characterisations have already been established, with Peter Sallis nailing Wallace's dimwitted inflections. And Aardman's love of nutty contraptions is there too.The film comes with many delightful sight gags packed around every corner. I especially liked the rocket ship's wallpapered interior, and the throwaway sight of a handbrake on the control panel. But the most inspired idea is a coin-operated oven lying neglected on the Moon. I've always been an enormous fan of silent comedy, which is one of the reasons I like Gromit so much as a character. And Park and Aardman create an intriguing character with this oven.Wisely they don't give it a voice of its own (perhaps the budget didn't allow for two voice-over artists?). Instead they just build a character out of incidental details. And its all done in total silence. Like the cooker's daydreams of skiing, giving a parking ticket to Wallace's rocket, gluing the surface of the Moon back together, trying to hit Wallace with a truncheon only for the money to run out mid-swing.Nick Park directs it all with such a light touch that the film breezes by. However, as much as I enjoyed the film, it does have its flaws. A Grand Day Out is probably the weakest of the Wallace & Gromit shorts. The animation is a little rough around the edges, and lacks the pristine sleekness of the subsequent entries. It also falls down in the plot department. All of the other Wallace & Gromit films are driven by far stronger stories. This one is quite thin. For instance, we never learn how the cooker wound up on the Moon in the first place. (You'd almost swear it was something Wallace had dreamt up). The plot, such as it is, is made to take a backseat to the (admittedly funny) visual puns and Wallace & Gromit's effortless double-act.Perhaps A Grand Day Out hasn't aged as well as the other films, but a lot of the things we've come to love about Wallace & Gromit are already in place. One area where it does have the edge is the fact that its the most conceptually ambitious. All of the other films in the series have remained earthbound, and A Grand Day Out is the only one so far to aim for something a little more profound. It touches upon themes that are rarely seen in animation today. If it had the budget accorded to The Curse of the Were-Rabbit then perhaps A Grand Day Out may have become something extraordinary, rather than just an engaging entertainment.To look at it in the harsh light of day, A Grand Day Out is really the prototype. It was The Wrong Trousers that set the style for the series, and struck up the balance between top quality writing, sidesplitting comedy and fabulous animation in all of the right places. Still, a highly promising debut nonetheless, that rightfully converted an entire nation.

The world seems to be deserted except for a curious contraption that could only have come from Nick Park's mind. It's a cross between a domestic appliance, parking meter, and security guard. Wallace pops a coin in. It's very delayed-action, so he wanders off and leaves it.This gadget eventually switches on and assumes a strange sentience of its own. What follows is an odd-ball chase across the moon with Wallace coming within an ace of getting clobbered.This was the plasticine pair's first big-screen outing and the economies are obvious. The boys have a very coarse, unfinished appearance, unlike their smooth and slick representation in later works. If anything, they are more endearing and less stylised in this first production. Their characters are not yet fully formed.All's well that ends well. The boys blast-off home cheesated, whilst the bizarre lunar-guard learns to ski. Oddly, it seems no longer to be coin-operated.Strange and hilarious, well worth a watch. Presumably they don't live near Tesco.

Wallace and Gromit is the best of the lot, though Chicken Run is great too. Although this is the weakest offering from them(some of the clay was a bit runny), it is still hilarious. Wallace is superlatively voiced by Peter Sallis, and it is pretty much a one-man show. I loved Gromit, and although he never speaks, his facial expressions are priceless. I loved the idea of Wallace thinking the moon was made of cheese, and the plot never ran out of steam. The scenes on the moon, with the yellow box on wheels, were well done too. in conclusion, although this is the weakest short in terms of quality, the one that started it all is well worth watching. 9/10 Bethany Cox.

I finally saw it last night and was disappointed compare to the other two films. It was probably because of the other two had better clay graphics but that just shows Wallace and Gromit have evolved which is good too. The story wasn't really a story and wasn't good compared to the other two, the story was about Wallace was about to have his afternoon tea (cheese and crackers) were he finally sees there is no cheese in the house he decides to go to another place that has cheese....The Moon! Overall I thought A Grand Day Out had a few problems but other then that it was good!

Wallace (voiced by Peter Sallis) and Gromit are looking at holiday magazines when they decide to have their favourite cheese and crackers. Unfortunately, no cheese, but then Wallace gets the idea to go on Bank Holiday somewhere that has cheese. They decide that this location will be the moon, since its made of cheese (or at least in this animation). They build a rocket, land on the planet and keep trying the cheese made moon. A robot on the planet is trying to stop them while they are on the moon. The quality of this animation is obviously the fact that everything moving is made of Plastercine! It was nominated the Oscar for Best Short Animated Film (it was beaten by Park's Creature Comforts), and it won the BAFTA for Best Animated Film. Wallace and Gromit were number 11 on The World's Greatest Comedy Characters, and they were number 15 on The 100 Greatest Kid's TV Shows, and as part of Aardman Animations, they was number 15 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Outstanding!

Their one great love is cheese and they are horrified when they run out.  However it does give them an opportunity to go to the moon, which is made of cheese as we all know.  Wallace begins work on turning their shed into a space rocket for a moon picnic.Park's first Wallace & Gromit adventure started a line of success for him but it doesn't compare well with later efforts.  The plot is as good as all his films but the animation looks old and a little thin &#150; the budget is clearly smaller for this first outing.  However it still manages to be clever and very funny.Wallace is well voiced and is suitably set out character and Gromit is ever present to raise an eyebrow here and there when his master appears to be foolish.  He isn't as well used as he is in later films but he is still the silent star of this.Overall this may disappoint those who only know W&G from their Oscar winning antics but it is still worth a look.  It lacks the budget of the later films but the wit, imagination and humour are all still there &#150; and the good thing is that they all show how they were to get better in later years.

It seems to me not much better than the old Gumby cartoons, and the humor largely escapes me.That being said, this is my favorite Wallace and Gromit. It is simple, effective, and has a nice story. We get a good sense of how brilliant (yet lacking in common sense) that Wallace is, and the moon robot is a good character in himself. What is his back story? Who cares!

The voice of Peter Sallis as Wallace is perfect&#x85; I couldn't imagine anyone else voicing the part. I find the comic timing works to a tea and the storyline is both wacky and brilliant. There are very few things that make me laugh out loud, but there are several jokes in this film that still crack me up even 22 years later! Long may the BBC keep showing it!

This one is my least favorite by far, and I love it! It's about Wallace and Grommit going to the moon in hopes that the cheese that the moon is made of will satisfy there appetites. Of course, Grommit is hilarious, but doesn't talk. Wallace is great fun to listen to how stupid he is. This is the first of the three filmettes, and the animation is not as good, and neither is the script, but I have to say, I like the plot just as well. Oh, I forgot to mention the real scene stealer character in this pic. There's a robot on the moon that yearns to be a champion skater.

The plasticine animation is a little creaky and funny here, sort of reminiscent of the Mork animation about the little man in the box.Admirable though the craftsmanship behind it is, I've never actually been hugely into Wallace & Gromit (maybe a bit too clean and traditional for someone of my generation.) The only one I've really enjoyed is The Wrong Trousers (and that was more from when I was younger and less aware of, shall we say, the seedier pleasures of life.) I was driven to actively seek out this early effort due to the resurgence in popularity as a result of the hugely successful recent film adaptation.As technically impressive as the first two (all things considered!) this one lacks the emotional angle it's successors were to possess. That being said, it's fairly good fun as a first try and certainly set the standard for greater things to come. Two stars, but a good two stars. ** "},{"Title":"A good start","Date":"18 April 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Animation, Short, Adventure","Review":"  This is the weakest of the series, not much of a plot and a rather odd-looking Wallace.
