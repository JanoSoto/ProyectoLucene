He has obviously had a lot of training - only one criticism of his technique - he looks in the wheel as the ball is dropping - a good dealer looks at the layout and watches for late bets, he should be the last person to know which number has come up - he must have eyes in the back of his head tospot a cheat the way he deals!For realism, you can't fault this film - every character, even the peripheral extras are real and believable - it's a tour de force of perfect character sketches - the plot is almost irrelevant - in fact, it is not quite up to the incredible atmosphere created - but it's good enough, the film is well worth your time.

Clive Owen gives an amazing performance as the croupier of the title,   who is very conscious of his split personalities Jack, a gambler, the   writer who works in the casino to pay the bills, and Jake, a croupier,   a man who enjoys watching his customers losing all his money and who   makes sure he's always dealing the cards. In the end, Jack loses and   Jake wins. The message is delivered in the least subtle way possible,   Hell, the voice-over is practically an intellectual analysis on the   movie's meaning, but it works because Jack/Jake is an amazingly   engaging character and because the movie is so well directed. The crime   plot, although not surprising in the least, develops itself smoothly   and contains lots of unexpected sources of humor.    Croupier is a very stylish and criminally underrated neo-noir that   beats the living crap out of most of recent Hollywood releases   centering about a big robbery or con. It might be heavy-handed, but   it's conscious of where its strenghts lie, and Wilson is great. Why   it's so criminally underrated... I don't have the faintest about.

It is an expertly written story that is subtly directed and superbly acted.  It makes up for the dozens of dreadful independent films one has to mine to find such a gem.  Jack Manfred (Clive Owen) is a struggling writer, who on the advice of his father takes a job as a croupier at a local casino, a job he previously held when he lived in South Africa.  He takes the job to make some extra money, but soon he realizes that it would be an excellent setting for a novel.  He becomes an impassive observer of the gambling culture on both sides of the table, taking mental notes that are later incorporated into his book.  However, as time goes on he is seduced from observer to participant, gradually breaking all his own rules and justifying his decadence by convincing himself that he has become the character in his book.  His feeling of control is delusional as he is being manipulated by unseen forces that are beyond his comprehension.There is a wonderful multi-layered texture to the story.  It examines the psychological aspects of the gambling casino from the inside out, allowing us to look at the trade from the casino's perspective.  It also weaves in love, sex, deceit and betrayal along with robbery and murder.  A few plot gaps leave the viewer with some unanswered questions, but they are minor.  The ingenious weave of plot elements culminating in a clever ending more than makes up for the flaws.  Director Mike Hodges did an outstanding job of creating realistic casino environment without a lush budget.  Hodges got the feeling just right as well, portraying various types of gamblers from the high rollers to the addicts.The acting was superlative.  Clive Owen emerges from the shadow of his television resume to deliver a complex and brilliant performance as the cunning but stolid croupier.  If anyone with clout ever sees this film, his agent will certainly be getting some calls.  Alex Kingston also does a fine job as the enigmatic Jani, who lures him into a nefarious scheme that sends his life spinning dangerously out of control.This intelligent film keeps the viewer engrossed throughout.  I rated it a 9/10.  It presents a fine alternative to mindless big budget films that are more form than substance.

Yet this (short) film is oddly compelling although we actually get only a brief insight into the workings of the casino, there's something very addictive about the way it is presented, the film has the smack of authenticity and one watches transfixed, as if one was being shown it all for real.

Gina McKee plays a conventional love interest without simply being wallpaper; David Hamilton runs the Casino with an ambiguity that mirrors Jack's.Mike Hodges engineers tight, claustrophobic shots and choppy editing. Everything about the film is up close and suffocating shots in cars; Jack's tiny flat; stairwells and copulating couples in toilet cubicles. Owen's Jack is neither repelled by nor engages with this proximity. It only affects him if it foists itself upon him violently or he chooses to deal with it.

With money running out he follows a connection from his father that earns him a job interview in a London casino. After a short time he finds he has rediscovered the croupier bug and is back in love with his new job. He also finds that his experiences useful in creating a new book, lead the lead character, Jake, as a croupier. As he drifts apart from his girlfriend he loses himself in the world and starts breaking the rules &#150; ultimately getting involved with a patron, Jani, who asks him for help in organising a heist at the casino.Quite often it'll be the UK, European or underground markets that expose an American film as a good film after the US market has ignored it, but with Croupier it worked the other way round. Hardly making any impact at all upon release in the UK, it was apparently good reviews and good figures from the US that helped make it better known. As such I came to it with mixed expectations &#150; I sort of half knew what to expect from it but I had also been led to believe that it would impress me a great deal. In some regards I enjoyed the film; it is intelligent, dark, thoughtful and has a reasonably enjoyable plot &#150; even if the plot does have equal billing with the atmosphere. However don't expect a great plot that piles twist on twist, because this isn't what the film is about. Rather the film relies very heavily on the observations of the croupier himself (both as Jack and Jake) to drive the film forward. I can't think of another film that I've seen that uses voice-over to such a degree (and makes it work), usually heavy voice-over use implies that the script and characters were not strong enough to hold the film up by themselves.The clever twisting of Jack/Jake is subtle but done to good effect and was a big part of the reason that this film engaged me. Outside of this I found the plot to be rather hard work &#150; there is no one real thrust to the film with only the main one involving Jani really coming out to the front in order to deliver an ending in the traditional manner. This is a weakness and it stops the film being as satisfying as it could have been, with Jack not being provided with enough of a plot to be set in. That said it still works due to his character and some great direction from Hodges who avoids being overly flashy as the gambling world setting often encourages directors to be.Owen is very good and convinces in his many scenes &#150; he is the heart of the film and it is to his credit that he manages to do it. Even in voice-over he delivers good character and direction for the film. Kingston is not as good. Aside from doing her whole nudity thing yet again she also is lumbered with an accent that doesn't suit her and one that she doesn't sound comfortable with (even if it isn't that bad). McKee is OK, as are Ball, Morton and Parnell albeit in smaller roles. But in a film that is more about the croupier than anything else, the film is Owen's and he rises to it and does well with the lead role. Overall this is an OK film and one that deserves better than it received upon first release in the UK. However plot-wise it is not as satisfying as I would have liked it to be, instead it relies heavily on the character of Jack &#150; an aspect that is both the film's making and it's weakness (in that the film doesn't give him a good enough plot to be developed against).

It was a heist movie directed by Mike Hodges of GET CARTER fame and it`s a movie that brought Clive Owen to everyone`s notice , but it was a movie I never got round to seeing until a few nights ago when channel 4 broadcast it.Right away I was convinced that I was going to be watching something that was influenced by CASINO , Hodges directing style of this movie screamed at me Scorsese , Scorsese , Scorsese but after the first ten or so minutes that struck me the movie might not be going anywhere it finally finds its feet . CROUPIER might not be the most compelling movie I`ve seen all year but it is a very interesting drama as we follow Jack Manfred a wannabe writer who works in a casino . Two things I should point out though  First of all a lot of reviews I read when the movie was originally released is that they over stated the point about this being a  heist  movie when in fact it`s more of a drama . If you`re expecting something along the lines of OCEANS ELEVEN you`re going to be disappointed . Secondly if you have no interest whatsoever in what croupiers or  frustrated writers do for a living you`ll probably have little desire in watching this movie . Like I said this is mainly a drama than a crime film and I must say that Hodges has perfectly captured the rather impersonal , empty and lonely atmosphere of London very well , and seeing as Clive Owen seems really at home in a casino wearing a tuxedo he wins my nomination as the next Bond . James Bond I did start off this review by criticising the start of this movie so I`ll finish by criticising the ending . It`s not the worst ending I`ve ever seen in a movie but I can`t help feeling cheated by the last twenty minutes which sees an unlikely plot twist of Jack visiting a morgue along with some unlikely dialogue with a policeman .

Perhaps the absence of these motifs that you'd expect in any conventional film is what makes it special, I suspect that they add to it's originality, but what really makes the film work is how completely engaging the main character is made.Jack Manfred, from his chain smoking to his dry voice-over, is completely engaging as a character, without having to go through any obvious conventionalities that would force the audience into finding him endearing. This is surely a combination of Mike Hodges directorial skill, the script and Clive Owen's acting ability.The film is essentially a character study, with a front of a gambling film, that examines this character and his relationships with the people in his life, - his girlfriend, boss, father and colleagues, how he sees the world, and how he will cope when presented with certain situations.It is brought to the screen with quality that demands attention and a score that heightens the atmosphere the film creates and really sets the tone.

This message is put across through his inability to get a good book going and general lack of being able to communicate and holding things together.This film just feels 'efficient'. It's never really that colourful, the characters voices never really get above a certain low decibel level and most people just seem to skulk around getting on with their business. But, what is it that makes this such entertaining viewing? Well, for one; the constant reference to the protagonist BY the protagonist is fascinating. We're well aware of his writers block by now and as he narrates everything he does, we get the feeling he's basically narrating his book. This means he's chopping and changing between 1st and 3rd person referencing, another thing to suggest he's disconnected. This connected very well with the story telling method the film got across.The fact that early on, his father calls to tell him he's supposedly moving into a new business is not in the slight bit interesting to Jack (Owen) and this also suggests a lack of interest and communication skills with people, most noticeably this time his family. Oddly enough, this little item comes back to bite him and the viewer and acts as the twist in the end. What's also interesting is the general things about this film. The script contains constant references to 'luck' and 'chance' as well as quips like 'what are the odds?' I found this knitted in nicely with the general dialogue and there wasn't too much of it, either. Other such things include the way we see a conflict towards the end at a gambling table, yet we don't cut away to the following situation in the office where the offender was taken to by the management, like we would've done in films such as 'The Cooler' (2003).There are very few disappointing things with Croupier but one I can't forgive is the scene that the final third of the film builds towards; the actual robbery. It was quick, chaotic and just plain bad. I had no clue as to what happened and had to wait for the characters to tell me if it had been a success or not as the images didn't tell the story at all. Oddly enough, the entire cast seem to be pretty fed up. In fact it's pretty dull, yet effective acting from all concerned and this added to the film and its atmosphere it had going on.With most of the good principals Croupier has and very few flaws, the film ends up being a stylish, dark and close to depressing noir tale that delivers.

He was also behind 'Flash Gordon'.Fortunately, Croupier fell in the category of being more like the former than the latter - a gritty, urban tale about very ordinary, mundane people just doing their job. Hodges turns on the magic, however, making the life of Jack Manfred, struggling writer and part-time Croupier as complex and as multidimensional as any character I've ever seen, as he is sucked into London's gaming underworld.This is a great film - I can't tell you too much or I'll spoil it, because this one twists and turns and doubles back on itself like a rattlesnake in a sack. Clive Owen is fantastic as the emotionless, stony faced Croupier, and the supporting cast is always believable.This is a low budget film, with minor stars and functional sets, but the quality of the writing, acting and directing shines through and I only loved this film more when I saw it again on cable pay-per-view.

There are accurate insights into the mentality of The Croupier (Clive Owen) in this film. Its an atmospheric film that draws you into mental workout through some stylish directing - firstly, you feel as if you are inside the casino with Owen, then one feels perched on his shoulder, he then draws you in with his views of those around him, then as the film progresses, you become a friend of his, and through a smooth direction in narative (which seems entirely plausible) you go beyond perching, and venture instead into Owens head - you feel like you are there rooting along side him, as if you are kindred spirits and are reading his mind.......Owen excels as the Croupier, his portrayal FORCES you into joining him, whether you want to or not.The plot is subtle, and I wont spoil the outcome.

But he gives the appearance of having been there and done that and he's cool as a cucumber. And very effective. This is one of this first really movie roles (after years of British t.v.) and you can see how he is a whole level above his peers. There isn't really a bad performance in the bunch, but lots of just serviceable stuff that lets him do his thing. The plot builds nicely, with some subtle twists and decent writing. The ending is a weirdly flat experience--meant to be shocking and open-ended no doubt--which makes you re-evaluate the climax right before that. Owes plays it all as if nothing mattered, though he does on the inside seem affected.The other twist here, almost unnecessary but it works, is that Owen is also writing a book about it all, and he sometimes (through voice-over narration) confuses and conflates the lead character in the book with himself. They are of course the same, sort of, but not too closely or he'd get caught.At doing whatever he is really doing. Never mind all the possible flaws in the plot, it clicks overall and it's intriguing. It also has a nice, if a bit brightly illuminated (t.v. style) filming. Solid, low budget stuff.

The story is not really what's the core of the movie it's the acting, the settings, the dialog and the presence of that certain something... Strange to say, but it is much thanks to the boor dome, and the feeling of standing still while moving that makes Hodges' dark Brit-com such a masterpiece of coolness. Not even the very twist of the story raises more than a brow on the main character - that's how cool it is.Of course, the whole movie, and everything in it, is very stylized. But that's, if not, not the point, the entire idea of it.And then again Thanks to Clive Owen! As written, he is, as Jack the croupier, beyond great, cooler than Eastwood, in his tuxedo, black hair and dark eyes, cynically looking up from under those brows. If you thought he was good in 'Closer', you ain't seen nothing yet.

He takes the job in order to write a novel about it, in which he can watch this particular milieu from above, in a detached and superior position. In the casino he meets a number of people, including the troubled Bella (Kate Hardie, in my view, the movie's most compelling character). Other character, the gambler Jani (Alex Kingston) will eventually involve him in a plot to rob the place. This movie let us know more details about the gambling business that we may be interested to know, and the final twist doesn't really hold water, making the movie end in a somewhat disappointing note, but all in all this is a solid, unusual thriller.

When he starts to get back to business, things get interesting. This was moreover a good movie. It gives a glance at the world of gambling, features news faces (to me at least), and the results is quite entertaining. You might read bad critics about the movie. First of all, Owen does play the character well. of course he seems unpassioned and it could feel like he's not putting much of himself into the role. That is so wrong, the guy is cool, in the first meaning his croupier job is to act it cool, to get impressed by nothing, and from there, he lives the same way. But sometimes, well sometimes he has to let it go, to gamble even if he never gambles. The action is not that quiet, the only thing is that this is not an Hollywood-style movie the twists in the action are not punctuated by thrilling music etc. The action is all left to the spectator's appreciation, it's up to him to fully enjoy what is happening. The croupier is an interesting character, you might even get attached to him and his fake non-challance. Watch this movie, you should like it. If not, you will have spent an interesting hour and a half.

That is to say, this is very much a British movie.  Like the better films of John Schlesinger and Joseph Losey (British `by default'), Mike Hodges' `Croupier' assumes an intelligent, adult audience. Watching the film, while an entirely cinematic experience, is like reading a well-written novel. It isn't possible to see every layer of nuance, or every fine point of structure with a single viewing. This is the kind of movie that assumes the viewer is watching and listening very closely, making subtle connections along the way. To enumerate the myriad felicities of `Croupier' would be pointless and would spoil their discovery. This is a marvelous case of what used to be called a `thinking man's picture'.In the title role is the brilliant, perfectly cast Clive Owen. If the film were not based on a novel, one could think it was written especially for this actor. Quick-witted, intellectual, and powerfully handsome, Owen gives his  realization of `Jack/Jake' a singularly seductive life of its own. The character is therefore not merely interesting, as a carrier of the story's themes, but is detailed in way that seduces the viewer into identification and complicity.This is a tale that uses gambling as a metaphor. It certainly isn't the first to do so, but the complex, provocative approach Croupier takes toward its subject is on a higher level than most. Living is a gamble, this film says, and even if you refuse to participate, you still end up playing for stakes.

Those that say the Voice-Over hides a lack of script or inventiveness should watch one of Robert Bresson's short, lean films 'Pickpocket' (something 'Croupier' pays homage to; both in the narrative of the struggling, writer who is fascinated by another seedier lifestyle, and through the technical details V.O., sleights of hand, etc.) Bresson's film clocks in atonly 75 minutes, and works on a tight, sparse, ultimately rewarding, basis.

It's portrayal of the compulsive gambler, with his hunger, suppression of conscience, and delusional way of thinking, is a perfect antithesis of the movie's main protagonist, a croupier named Jack Manfred (Clive Owen).  But he's not a hero.  In fact, his existence is on almost the exact existential plane as the gamblers.  The interesting thing about this croupier is that he's as addicted to taking the addict's money as the gambler is to throwing it away.  It's not the money that draws him  he earns only 450 British Pounds a week.  It's the opportunity for self-definition.  He's struggling delineate himself, not as the product not of his family history, but of his own rational intentions.  The casino suits him perfectly.

Having done both, I can testify that Paul Mayersburg and Mike Hodges have done a fine job of conveying the atmosphere of a gaming environment, turning a reasonable plotline into a pretty watchable film. Croupier also has a high degree of technical accuracy (although the tech advisor should have pointed out that roulette wheels are never allowed to stop spinning while a table is open for business...)British casinos are much more low-key in appearance than their American counterparts and their staff are less likely to be interested in the science behind their jobs than they are in each other. While friendships between casino staff may be frowned on by the management, the idea of firing people who form relationships is ludicrous - they are much more likely to be put on opposite shifts. People who work such peculiar hours always socialise together and, when genders mingle, sex is never far away. In fact, the use of the word incest was a plum insight of Mayersburg's - that's pretty much how it is.While the atmosphere is well conveyed, its failing is, unfortunately, the performance of Clive Owen. Looking great and undoubtedly pretty good at the ice-cool & enigmatic stuff (which came first - the Owen or the Kemp...?), he is fantastically useless at conveying even the faintest whiff of emotion. Catch the way he tells Gina McKee You are everything I desire... Wooden isn't in it - there would be more life in his girlfriend's corpse than in his own performance at such moments.

Ping-Pong is what we play; one, two or three matches before going upstairs again to see the next film. We had two more movies; one chosen by me, the other by Gian. We watched Gian's choice because we had already watched a film I'd chosen.The thing with Croupier is rather strange. Don't ask me why I felt weird when it started, like I didn't trust the movie. There were many parts that should have been exciting but they weren't quite exciting to me. I tried to like those parts, but it became very difficult.From the outside it is a well done film, I mean; directed by a respected British filmmaker (Mike Hodges), an interesting plot, an attractive main character and among other films, poker. I haven't seen lots of poker pictures, but before Croupier I had seen some very good showings of this thrilling card game; for instance, Rounders and more recently Shade.Comparing Mike Hodges' film with the latter ones would only be useful in terms of how the movies deal with the game. Then, the three of them contain totally different characters in different realities, living different stories involving different situations. In Rounders we could meet two friends willing to get to a professional poker career. In Shade we experienced the lives of different people consumed by the game and its difficulties. However, in Croupier, there's just one character, and that could be one of the movie's problems. We see everything in Jack's (Clive Owen) life as a croupier, writer, gambler or whatever, and what I think is that the film gets so centered in him that it becomes boring.In the pages of what's close to a screenplay owner of contradictions, Jack walks along in his different facets and Paul Mayersberg forgets about the rest of the people involved in his tale. The contradictions I'm talking about is that the script can even follow the only character it cares about with some sense. It presents the main character's narration that at moments gets confused with the rest of the story, generating big time lines problems.Although it gets tedious, Clive Owen's narration is good, as his performance. At this film's time he had already had some Hollywood experiences, but in a movie from his own country, he was already proving the gifted actor he was. Watch it for his performance, or for some interesting poker scenes; but as I see it, there's not much more into it.

And bloody good it is, too.Croupier comes to you from Mike Hodges, who also directed the sublime Get Carter and the not-so-sublime, but highly amusing, Flash Gordon.  And it's easily one of the best crime movies of the 1990s, especially since it comes without the layer of Hollywood gloss that makes so many movies - even acclaimed ones like LA Confidential - seem glamorized and fake.Clive Owen does a superb job conveying much of his character's inner life through tone of voice and facial expression, which is very important in such a subtle flick.  With his wonderful stoic demeanor and tough-guy good looks, he would make an ideal James Bond, if someone ever chooses to make a serious movie with that character.  But it would be a sin if Owen joined that franchise as it is now - popcorny and ridiculous.  This is a better showcase for his talents than any slam-bang action movie.Some of the plot twists are a little silly - I'm not sure why the thieves rely so heavily on answering machines when making their plans! - but overall this is tightly written stuff.  And hey, you'll learn a lot about how casinos actually work.  I learned to stay away from them altogether...Needless to say, this is much grittier, smarter, and more satisfying than its closest American equivalent, which I am ashamed to say is probably Ocean's Eleven.

Like THE SPANISH PRISONER, it features irritatingly mannered narration, irritatingly mannered dialogue (where people speak, not as ordinary folk do, but in sinisterly loaded aphorisms), an irritatingly mannered hero (Clive Owen is a dead ringer for Campbell Scott), and an irritatingly mannered puzzle approach to plot.  Also, like THE SPANISH PRISONER, once you have accepted the basic air of smart-alecky contrivance, CROUPIER is very enjoyable, in fact even more so, because as a director, Mike Hodges has known greatness, whereas David Mamet has not.Set in the mirror-distorting world of casinos, the film is actually a pretentious rumination on the nature of the artist.  The hero, Jack Manfred, is an unsuccessful writer who becomes a croupier to earn money, and get material for his work.  The action we see is actually the novel of his experiences, and his narration frequently interrupts and comments on his fictional self.  This splitting of selves leads to a troubling doubling that scuppers Manfred's self-satisfied authority.You see, Manfred is one of those Nabokovian omniscient narrators who needs to have complete control over his story and characters.  He is a croupier because he doesn't want to gamble, take risks - he's the one in control. This extends to his artistic motives, which extend to teaching people how to think. But he is not absolutist enough to pull this off.  He thinks that by dividing himself in two - author and character - he can get the character to take all the risks he can subsequently order, as an author, into fiction. The film takes on a genuinely Kafkaesque (a sadly devalued phrase) as the discrepancy between Manfred's smug self-image (wholeness and power), and the reality of his experiences (a process of dissolution and emasculation resulting from male insecurity, machismo, fear of women, Oedipal complex and personal history (the mythic primal scene of South Africa, black-free place of his upbringing)), over which he has no control, becomes wider.  In true Mayersbergian fashion, the final sequence casts doubt over everything we have seem, and asks who is the real author in (and of) the film.Mike Hodges' elegant, unruffled direction conceals a script of prismatic complexity, distortion and fragmentation; a perfect metaphor for Manfred's surface control and inner collapse.  The dialogue is frequently unbearable, but once you attune to its rhythm, it becomes accumalitively compelling. The puzzle element of the film can be enlightening or annoying, depending on your taste, but there is enough bizarre incident, unpredictable plotting, clever sleight-of-hand, and hilarious (very British) visual non-sequiturs to keep one interested.

Croupier uses narration, in fact, it is a key element in the movie; however, it clarifies very little and actually makes parts of the film even harder to follow. What it does do is give an insight into the personality of the narrator and hero of the story, Jack Manfred, whose basic philosophy is Hang on tightly and let go lightly.Croupier, as the name suggests is about gambling. During the course of the film blackjack and the roulette wheel feature prominently. To the uninitiated, some of the gambling procedures are obscure, and the script provides little help in understanding them.The story is about a struggling writer, Jack Manfred played by Clive Owen, who becomes a croupier to make ends meet. His previous experiences in this capacity have left bitter memories, but he soon impresses his new employer with his prowess at the gaming tables. The job puts pressure on his relationship with his girlfriend, Marion, played by Gina McKee.Despite the casino rules, he becomes attracted to Jani, a female gambler played by Alex Kingston (with a fairly convincing South African accent). Jani is under pressure from creditors and talks Jack into helping rob the casino. Things take an unexpected turn with Jack writing a bestselling novel based on his experiences.Although the plot seems straightforward when spelled out like this, much of what happens is hard to follow. Don't make a cup of coffee during this movie, let alone go to the bathroom; otherwise it could become totally indecipherable.The film maintains a lively pace, building tension towards the robbery scene, but when it finally arrives, it is decidedly anti-climatic. It seems that in their attempts to create something fresh and avoid the obvious, the makers of the film also forgot how to reward an audience for staying the course.The characters in Croupier are relentlessly unsympathetic. They spend a great deal of their time at the blackjack table or at the roulette wheel; the focus of their world is on themselves and their addiction to gambling. Jack Manfred is cynical, egotistical, stern faced and humourless. Although he seems devoid of real charm, women in this movie are drawn to him, but he cheats on them, and treats them badly without exception.The movie ends with the revelation that the Jack's father may have had a hand in events that unfold during the course of the movie. This rings a little false as the father's character is only briefly sketched in the film, and for the plot to then hinge on his involvement undermines what had been up until then, a perceptive if somewhat cynical story line.Croupier is original and different &#x96; even if opportunities have been missed to fully involve the audience with its unappealing and self-seeking characters.

Croupier is a classic character study. The ethics & rules that Jack has placed upon him thru his employer get strained and blurred. The robbery scene was very disjointed and confusing - what happened? The death of Marion left more questions than answers and the revelation that Jack's dad was in fact behind the casino robbery was not developed enough.

Of course, it may be because of the shock of his appearance; the film was made more than ten years ago, and Owen was youthfully slim, and had bleached out hair. However, Owen did not rely on the superficial to create his character, Jack.Jack is a cold, distant, and - as we discover by the end of the film - amoral. Is this genetic, inherited from his father? Is it because of he is a writer, and he is driven to create something on the one hand derived from his life, but on the other unique and separate? Or, is it that the most significant thing about Jack is his amorality? It is the undercurrent of amorality, or, some might choose to believe, immorality that drove Film Noir, and this is why The Croupier was referred to as Neo-Noir. There is an eerie coldness and bleakness to the story, the characters, sets, lighting, etc. And the amorality tale is told with precision and relish by all involved. This is a great movie if only for the fact that it was so unusual for its time.Owen's performance is not the only one of note.

The way it provides felt life is in the way it takes us into the world of the gamblers and the people who take their money at the tables. We learn the way gamblers cheat. We learn a bit of the croupier mentality. We see the way the public and private lives of the croupier blend. This is a British suspense film, which means, not a lot of suspense by American standards. When there is an attempt to rob a casino, we don't see bombs and bullets flying. It's a little too civilized for that. That's okay.There's a lot in the film to see, though, since it isn't filled with mind-numbing violence. You get the time to watch Jack the croupier change as his career steals more and more time from his writing. In fact, you see him become more like Jake, the character from the novel he's stitching in his spare time. There are a couple of small plot point problems I have with the film, but that may be from not following it closely enough. Jack comes into some money at one point, and he makes it clear in the narration that he can't spend the money, it could be demanded back from the people who gave it to him if their project collapses. By the end of the film, when the project has collapsed, the money drops as an issue. The final scene opens up more issues that couldn't be resolved earlier, so they hang a bit in the air.

The meat is in the script, which is packed with subtle meanings, double entendres and ironies. For example, Jack, our hero, prides himself in being honest, because he doesn't gamble and cheat like the people that he observes in the casino, but he deliberately makes up wild lies about himself, when people question him.  The woman who is trying to interest him in a dishonest business deal says that she only wants to use him, because he's the only one in the casino that she can trust, and so on.  The movie depicts real people with all their flaws.  Jack says very few people are good and those who are leave us early...the others of us who are flawed will die, but much slower.  This is a film of observance and participation, of good and bad, of glamour and ugly reality.  Just when you get comfortable with one aspect, a contrary feature is introduced that throws you off and you never know what is around the corner.  Kind of like Jack's life....you are worried for him during the whole film, although he is not the most sympathetic protagonist.In my opinion, not since David Mamet has there been writing with this much spark and intellectual depth and Croupier in some respects reminds me of The Spanish Prisoner.  If you like excellent writing, you should see this film or at least rent it when it comes out in video.

Before that there is much to enjoy in this archly cynical tale of part time author and full time croupier, Jack, played convincingly by Clive Owen. Jack compartmentalizes his life, so much so that he almost comes across as being a split personality. But great interest is maintained by his personal involvement in events are combined with his dry detached observations of the same events.He has a tempestuous relationship with his wife, Marion. He claims to love her but has a brief fling with another casino worker Bella. She is promptly sacked from the casino but then turns up on Jack's doorstep to accuse him of getting her sacked. He denies this. but since we get no other explanation, we can only imagine she was correct.Then there's Jani, a south African woman, who appears to be heavily in debt and in real risk of physical violence or worse being acted on her. After a scene in which he, rather strangely, fails to sleep with her (although literally sleeping in the same bed as her) she offers him £10,000 for some odd and unclear casino scam. He accepts.Various more or less interesting characters and subplots appear along the way to kept the story moving. These all seem to be progressing to a powerful conclusion. Sadly, however, this is never realized. Instead the climax consists of not just one, but many, failed attempts to tidy things up.MAJOR SPOILERS The first indication of this is the shocking and unnecessary death of Marion, which seems to serve no other purpose than to write her out of a story after she has fulfilled her usefulness. No explanation for this is given and to add to the strangeness, the policeman in charge blurts out I loved her you know. A line both puzzling and almost unintentionally funny.As bizarre and shocking as this was, had the film ended here, it could have been filed away alongside certain enigmatic events, such as the payment made to Jack. Being unexplained, the viewer could decide for themselves. But instead we are spoonfed a 'feel good' ending which blandly and unconvincingly over-explains some things while leaving other things dangling.The payment turns out to be made by his father using his bride-to-be Jani as go-between. This explanation actually undermines the film before it since this subplot, which seemed sinister, now becomes cartoonish.Likewise Jack's novel is published (anonymously) and implausibly becomes an international sensation. This is unlikely since Jack's authorial voice is too dark and cynical for the masses. I did not believe it, nor did it fit the general mood of the film. Nor could I believe that Jack would just carry on a job he professes to hate when he is rolling in money.Finally we see Jack with Bella. Now they are together? Is this meant to be a feel good ending?

If you like satire, you will most likely like this movie. Nevertheless, you will always wonder if the makers genuinely tried to force some deeper meaning into their dialogues and narration. If that was the intention, it failed gloriosly, but in a satirical way. The pseudo-philosophical statements from the off are so shallow that it hurts to even consider them as serious.

It is one of those movies you'll never see because U.S. distributors think that putting out Dollman IX is a better financial investment than a fantastic piece of film work by a seasoned director.Croupier was shown as part of the American Cinematheque's run of Michael Hodges' work.  I won't profess filmic snobbery - I had no idea who Michael Hodges was and wouldn't have known him if he popped up in my soup. He's directed over 13 films for theaters and TV, including Get Carter (with Michael Caine), The Terminal Man (with George Segal), Flash Gordon, and A Prayer for the Dying.  He's certainly bounced around for years, but when he hits the mark he does it pretty damn well.  After watching Get Carter (immediately after Croupier), it was evident just how many modern films borrow from that 1972 thriller.  Croupier, made in 1998, is evidence that Hodges never went away, he was just ignored while he got better in the background.Croupier is a phenomenal piece of work about a novelist, cold and detached, who takes a job as a croupier in a casino in order to find material to write about.  He finds it, and finds that the world of the casino and its chaos invades his own.  As much as he tries to cooly detach himself as the observer, the freakish accidental nature of the casino throws his life into turmoil.  As a croupier, addicted to the high of watching other people lose, he never gambles, always calculating the odds so he never loses. But life and the casino are too similar and he's forced to deal with his world becoming one giant gamble.It's a complexity that only a mature writer could conceive, and only a mature director could develop.  It is a story that demands a subtle, deliberate guide.  The characters must be kept unaware of the other's motivations.  There are timings and attitudes that are revealed in the progression of the film that make each payoff worthwhile, but an amateur would be too eager to reveal them early.  Hodges does a brilliant job, taking Paul Mayersberg's screenplay and exploring its underworld with style.If you can find a way to see it, make sure you do.  It's what Rounders wanted to be, but was infinitely too juvenile to attain.  Croupier does not have U.S. distribution, so it's unlikely you'll see it, even on video. Make your inquiries.

Unfortunately, Croupier is also a contradiction - a film that started out with a purpose and ended up in disarray, a film with sustained suspense leading to a pittance of a climax.  Jack (Clive Owen) is the storyteller who wants to be a 'detached voyeur' to the losers who indulge in his gaming table but he finds an addiction to seeing other people lose.   Jack, in his erstwhile campaign to be the only honest dealer in town, falls for his split personality, Jake, who panders for dishonesty.  Jake is also the main character in a novel about the seedy casino business who also makes Jack's day when the novel becomes a best seller, read by one and all, including Jack's casino boss who doesn't see any connection to his own business. Marion (Gina McKee) is Jack's live-in girl friend who could be his conscience but would rather not, and belongs to him until he is unfaithful, in which case, she runs off with another man only to reappear a few frames later ready to absolve him of all his sins.  She also worked for the police force but has decided that being a store detective is more rewarding.  Then there is Jack's father who Jack thinks, ('wink-wink') is a busy entrepreneur but all the while believes is a low-account shyster.  Finally we have Jani (Alexandria Kingston), an older woman that Jack seems to lust for, who disrobes in front of Jack and spends the night in bed with him but nothing happens because Jack is too honorable and she isn't.   Croupier probably started out with good intentions and some good ideas such as  The gaming industry is crooked and one honest person's actions would lead everyone else to change.  Or there should be honor even among thieves.  Or Ernest Hemingway started out writing about cheats so why not make a movie about that.

It substitutes style for substance.  Artiste for true art.In this case, this character study of the life of a writer-turned-casino dealer has all the appeal of a television documentary.  It's interesting, if passionless.  I came away with feeling I learned something &#150; in this case it was that British dealers are not allowed to accept tips (as opposed to, say, the migratory patterns of Sub-Saharan waterfowl).The subtext of the telling thinly veils a screenwriter (Paul Mayersberg) who's clearly disappointed with his own agent &#150; a theme which culminates in yet another hole in this sieve of a plot.  On the other hand, I found myself actually enjoying the voice-over stream of consciousness at the gaming tables, even though the technique boasts the cinematic finesse of a chain saw.  I've often speculated that dealers view the gambling public with the codependent disdain of a seasoned hooker, and this film confirms my cynical suspicions.The role of the flirtatiously perky Marion (Gina McKee) is intriguing, yet in the end I was left shrugging with open palms.  Her actions/reactions often seem disingenuous as if, well &#150; scripted.  It's a shame, because this role could have taken this film to the limit.The problem with CROUPIER is that it tries to do too much within the context of the telling.  This is a setup that promises a great deal, but in the end delivers little.  With its multiple subplots and twists, there isn't sufficient screen time to fully realize the characters, and I was left not caring about any of them in particular.  A juggler with one too many balls in the air.  With sensible rewrites, this script might have actually transcended the austere acting style encouraged by so many European directors.And the steeled coolness of our hero, Jack Manfred (Clive Owen), also does little to evoke empathy.  The film alternates the polarity of his character from savvy insider to dimwitted stooge.  Certainly a man with his street smarts would've seen a lot of these plot points coming down Broadway (up Abbey Road?).  Time and again, we wonder, `What happens next?' yet the payoff often diminishes the protagonist's intelligence to that of a gullible patsy.Is it worth a look?  On the whole, yes.

He dyes his hair blond and wears clothes that George Michael threw out ten years ago.His father (Nicholas Ball), a bartender at a South African casino, gets him a job at a London casino as a croupier.  When he lands the job, Jack assumes the alter ego of Jake.  He washes the dye out of his hair and wears a tux wherever he goes.  He also begins a forbidden affair with a co-worker named Bella (Kate Hardie) and is aggressively flirted with by a beautiful, mysterious South African gambler named Jani (Alex Kingston).  At the end of the day, however, Jack takes all of Jake's adventures and puts them into the novel he has finally gotten around to writing.The only real mystery to this film, besides how it will turn out, is who is Jani and what are her motives.  And since that's not really central to the plot, I can't really say this is noir.  However, this film does use several noir elements to good use (hard-boiled narration; cynical, world-weary hero; femme fatale).Unfortunately, the film is slightly flawed.  There are no stand-out performances by any of the actors, and the last twenty minutes or so of the film seems to disintegrate.  It's as if screenwriter Paul Mayersberg were told to wrap it up just as he had gotten two-thirds finished.On the whole however, Croupier is a highly intelligent, entertaining piece of quasi-noir.  I rated it 8 out of 10.

Very interesting movie, and having seen it with a good friend we were not quite sure exactly WHAT happened - particularly in the climatic moment - but it would appear as though this movie does blur the line between story and story-within-a-story - is Jack's life as a croupier real (and part of the point is even if it were real it's still a story in a movie!) or is it all actually the novel he's writing?  Is it in some way a metaphor for the life of a writer? He controls the game but he doesn't gamble himself, it's all about watching people lose, etc...The very end of the movie where he no longer hears the sound of the ball and has become master of the game is particularly intriguing in this light...The screenplay doesn't hammer this point home at all, but does leave it's share of clues, particularly with it's cast of characters that are all a little too vivid to be taken as anything but...characters that might appear in a novel or screenplay.  I'd be very interested in how others interpreted this and those clues, and in exactly WHAT happens during the big heist.

But in order to write one's own life, one has to at the same time both live it and be a detached observer of it. Thus the film's central tension how long will the sullen, sunken-cheeked snot, who eschews gambling and holds himself above the compulsions of others, remain immune? Does ice really flow in his veins? Can his contempt for humanity, all those who greedily grovel before him every night, really prop him up and sustain him?Well, of course not. Any experienced movie-goer knows this overconfident fool's jig is up the minute the femme fatale takes her seat at his blackjack table, cleavage exposed and dressed in black, no less. She's ER's Gina McKee (is the price of admission really worth seeing her in the buff, nipples plump and taut?). The only question remaining is who is setting him up? The movie relies heavily on this for its major punch line, which, unfortunately, by the time it arrives, has been practically neutralized by a) too many plot details left dangling (who really killed Marion? who ratted on the reformed hooker and why?); and b) the movie's overwrought chilly pretentiousness.And the voice-overs when will they ever learn to use them sparingly, if at all? Spoken narration superimposed on image violates, distracts from, cinema's inherent visual language; the action might as well be interrupted by explanatory written placards as in silent movies. Every beginning writer learns show not tell, yet voice-overs do nothing but tell, tell, tell.

He doesn't seem to care much about anything -- certainly not for the various women he interacts with, nor does he have any friends.  The drama takes place in oh-so-hip and oh-so-decadent London (shades of Hanif Koureshi).  Everything is relative, and of course 'Society' is to blame for its corruption of the 'natural man' (ho hum).But essentially, the main character has no morality whatsoever and, excepting a couple incidients of uncontrolled rage, almost not emotion. The problem with such amorality and 'existential ennui' is that you can't really a have drama; if nothing matters, then there's nothing to resolve.  And ifthe croupier doesn't care much about anything, then we can't care about him as the 'plot' (such as it is) unfolds.The post-modern pose of smirking irony which this film so exemplifies has become tedious.

But it fails at almost every level, and emerges as a clumsily plotted, heavy-handedly directed, laughably portentious farrago, with a cast of deadly dull characters. Had it been fully released in 1998, when it was finished by director Mike Hodges, it would at least have had some novelty value,  but having only now (summer 2001) been given a general release it is simply the latest in a string of  British movies about the seamier side of London life.Like other films in this Brit-noir genre, Croupier - and especially its main character Jack Manfred, played by Clive Owen - aims at a cool, sardonic tone, but in the main achieves only dour charmlessness. Gina McKee as Jack's girlfriend Marion , Alex Kingston as enigmatic gambler Jani, and Kate Hardie as fellow-croupier Bella, provide ample female interest, but little glamour, despite a few nice frocks (black, naturally) and a dash of nudity. Practically, the only liveliness in the film is provided by Nick Reding as Max, another croupier,who has a refreshingly down-to-earth view on life. Max is also given about the best line in the movie - when Jack is intoning Hemingway's famous quotation about being stronger in broken places, Max reminds Jack that Hemingway shot himself. The term existential has been applied to the movie, and at every turn it tries to underline parallels between gambling - with its winners,  losers, chancers and cheats - and everyday life; but this is hardly an original thesis, though it might seem profound  to some younger members of the audience. Another, intellectual aspect of the film is that Jack is using his experiences in the casino as material for a novel. I think more might have been made of this in order to enliven the film, with perhaps some scenes being ambiguous as to whether they were factual or extracts from Jack's book (though this would have been derivative of The Usual Suspects).For me, the best aspect of the movie are the gambling scenes in the casino, which are well shot and gripping, but don't compensate for the various downsides.

This movie is neither a mystery, thriller, nor high drama. It is just about a guy who says a lot of stuff, and is a really good dealer. Clive Owen behaves so emotionlessly flat, that I can't tell if it's deliberate. There is so much talking, and no real point. I really must have missed something about the ending, cuz I was dead lost. Plus I really have no intention of wasting another 90 minutes of my life watching this again just to get some clarification. Maybe it's good, and maybe it's bad. My initial reaction bad.The most shocking moment in the entire movie was seeing a BUTT-NAKED LIKE A NEWBORN JAYBIRD Alex Kingston (Dr. Elizabeth Corday on E.R., and gentlemen, her breasts are *hypnotic*.) Unfortunately, she displayed her surprisingly glorious nudity in a less than entertaining movie. "}]
