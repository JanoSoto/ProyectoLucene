The point is not that this may be what we experience after death; it is rather that we need to think more about what it is in this life that we'd really like to keep with us forever.This point needs emphasis. When asked what we want most in life, most of us will talk about our career, or a business venture perhaps, or some other accomplishment. This movie suggests that these kinds of things may not, at the end of the day, be so important as some other experiences we may have. In any case, it challenges us to rethink what it is we really value.Some reviewers complain about the quite ordinary surroundings and poor production values of the movie. I prefer to think of the choice of sets etc as humble and realistic. Could any movie, whatever its budget, ever possibly do justice to this subject matter?Much of this movie is devoted to explorations of the lives of a number of rather ordinary people, trying to identify their most cherished memories. Some reviewers have condemned The Afterlife as boring, boring, BORING on this account. It all depends on whether other people interest you. If all you want to see is car chases, sex, explosions, cool special effects,...avoid this movie. Only, it's worth noting that the lives and thoughts of others may help us to better understand ourselves. And nowhere more so than in this movie.

Most say that the single most important lesson they learned is that the actions we think are trivial and unimportant turn out to be the most important, especially ones that involve spontaneous acts of love. While not exactly a life review, in After Life by Hirokazu Koreeda, a group of recently deceased people are asked to look back at their life and choose only one memory from their life that they want to take with them to eternity. The process compels people to look at their life in its entirety and see what worked and what was missing.Set in a dreary barracks-like way station, civil servants meet with those just crossed over to help them choose the experience they want to hold on to. For some, the choice is easy, for others it is difficult. Those that will not or cannot choose are consigned to work in the substation with the newly deceased until they are ready to move on. The counselors work one on one with each individual telling them that they have three days to make their choice. Once a memory is selected, a film crew recreates the memory-- sets are built and the little touches of sights and sounds are selected until the deceased are satisfied that they are witnessing a perfect recreation of their experience. It is that film that they take with them, not the original memory.At first some choose things such as a trip to Disneyland, a sexual encounter, or a memorable bowl of rice but later gravitate toward experiences that are more meaningful. The center of the film revolves around those who are unable to choose. Ichiro Watanabe (Taketoshi Naito) is a 70-year old management consultant who has led an uneventful life and is challenged to find a memory he thinks is worth preserving for all time. To help him in this process, he is allowed to scan through piles of videotapes representing each year of his life. One young man wants to choose a dream instead of an actual event. Another wants to forget his past entirely, and an elderly woman is stuck in the mindset of a nine-year old girl.After Life is the story of the caseworkers as well. Takashi Mochizuki (Arata) has been stuck in limbo because he cannot find any happiness in his twenty-two years until he realizes how his short life deeply affected someone else. His perfect realization also affects a co-worker Shiori (Erika Oda) who has fallen in love with him. After Life is a beautiful and touching film that allows us to reflect on the things that brought us joy in our own life, and to recognize that true happiness lies, not in outward symbols of success, but in giving ourselves to others.

Although this has been asked many times through cinema in the past, few films have answered as elegantly as Afterlife.Directly after dying the departed are received by a group of counsellors who assist them in finding what was, for them, the most beautiful and perfect, single experience of their lives. For some the choice is easy and they are instantly able to provide the moment, which, once recreated by technicians, they remain in forever but the majority of the film concentrates upon those who are unable to find their perfect moment, and need extra help to recall past loves and lost days of their youth.  The institution has the perfect means to assist this choice, with the complete life of everyone on grainy home-video, perhaps a comment on the tehcnology and recording-obsessed Japanese.Many of the scenes are visually exceptional, especially those in the snow and everything seems very real, and, ironically, down-to-earth, especially the school building being used throughout the film giving an institutional feeling, but the interaction between the staff is where the film holds its true strength. Especially interesting is the relationship between Shiori, a newly employed worker, and Mochizuki, her mentor, which develops throughout. The film is slow to start due to the documentary style often used, but proceeds in an enveloping manner holding your attention to the end.

What the two films share, however, is the theme of memory (Note also a theme with Hirokazu Kore-eda's documentary work - check out Without Memory, about a man suffering of severe amnesia). In Maboroshi No Hikari Yumiko is not able to forget the memory of her dead husband, whereas in Afterlife the recently deceased must chose one memory that will accompany them into eternity.I feel that Kore-eda handles this entirely hypothetical premise in the best possible way, by steering completely clear of the stylistic superficialities with which so many other films about life after death desperately try to make themselves believable. The unspectacular old school building as a setting, the ceiling window with its interchangeable templates for the different stages of the moon, a character who himself has doubts as to whether this is really the best way of going to the next world and the absence of any religious connotations, among other things, all serve to keep the focus on the characters and their memories - many of whom are actually real. Apart from tongue in cheek humour, the lack of music also prevents over-sentimentalization and makes the memories the people recall the more sincere. The no-budget filming of the recollections of the deceased in order to trigger their personal memory, toward the end of the movie, also illustrates that the director is fully aware of his own limitations and possibilities as a film-maker. Rather than just trying to create the illusion of some half-baked version of the hereafter, he wants to challenge the viewer to reflect on what would be his/her most important memory - and succeeds in every way.This is a movie that surly can be appreciated by anyone who possesses at least a tiniest inkling of openness and willingness to experience cinema as more than mere entertainment.

In spite of having unexplained points, like for example the need itself of lasting with only one single memory, and inconsistencies, like why the need of shooting the memory, if the staff can bring videotapes of the entire life, what matters is the originality of this unique movie. One point that has always impressed me in cinema is the fact the actors and actresses last forever in the eyes of the audiences along generations. In this movie, each one of us has the chance to be an actor or actress, and write our own screenplay. Further, I personally recalled many good moments of my life just because of the storyline of this movie, and I found how difficult it could be to select only one good moment of my life to last forever.

If you had to pick one moment, one memory to keep with you and the rest were going to be erased what would it be? This is the central question of Afterlife a film about life, memory, happiness, movie making, and only in tangent, death. A group of dead people arrive at a dilapidated building where they are told to select a single memory that they will dwell in for all eternity. Heaven as it turns out is only a memory. The film is mostly these people talking directly into the camera documentary style reflecting on what was most important to them.I recently told a friend about this movie, who told me it sounded corny, and if the film had only been about these people I, might agree. I told my friend that I liked the film because while watching it I reflected on my entire life, and what happiness had meant to me during it. I was almost shocked and a little saddened by how quickly I came to realize what my moment was, like the movie as a whole it leaves a bittersweet taste. My friend told me they didn't think about their life that way, and that it would be too depressing to do so. I told her that someone in the movie says that too, and what made the movie as a whole so good and not just a clever concept was how honest it was about the complications between notions of a meaningful life, nostalgia, and personal happiness.The dead have a half a week to choose which memory they want and the rest of the week is spent filming the memories in a sound studio. The screening at the end of the week is to be their moment of ascension. Though silent at first the counselors shooting these memory-movies are not separate from the process, they too are dead. Takashi and his trainee Shiori we see handle most of the cases.Afterlife despite its title is not a film about death, but about memory and self-reflection. Two characters become problematic early on, one an old man who says he cant remember his life clearly enough to choose a specific moment, the other a young man who refuses to chose a moment, insisting it would be avoiding responsibility for his life and a surrender to empty nostalgia. Takashi becomes interested in the old man's case(for personal reasons we discover later), and has the man's life sent to him on videotape so that he may observe and report, in a quieter variation on Albert Brook's Defending Your Life (a conceptual cousin to Afterlife).Afterlife is about producing films that capture only a single moment and that only have meaning to single person; films that will only be screened once, but will be remembered literally forever. They are so personal as to be inconsequential to anyone but their intended viewer, but I couldn't think of a more meaningful type of film to make both for an audience and their creators. I think this is why many people watch films, at times to identify and at others to connect with what is unidentifiable.Russian silent film director Aleksandr Medvedkin used to travel the USSR on a train stopping at random villages and asking the people what their problems, issues, and concerns were and then asked for their assistance in making a film about just that. Doing this Medvedkin wanted to give cinema to the masses. The world of Afterlife likewise gives cinema to the individual.There are sprinklings of melodrama in the film towards the end, but they allow the characters to actually reach important conclusions that the film wouldn't have been able to connect together otherwise. Even if you can't remember your own moment, isn't it possible that you are an extra or a main character in someone else's, and nothing as dramatic as some old flame pining over you, but maybe a moment spent with a friend or a family member. Maybe your parent's happiest moment was when you were born. It's only from an imaginary position like an Afterlife that we have the distance to reflect on such grand feelings intimately and sincerely.Since were not dead, this question can be written off as sophomoric or corny, our best days may in fact still be ahead. But I wonder if without some prior sense of what is truly beautiful, meaningful, and warm fuzziness incarnate whether we can know true bliss when we finally see it. This is assuming it's something you can even know when you see it, and not something that only occurs with memory. I was once told in a Sunday Sermon, happiness is predicated on happenings and events, but joy was something internal that had little relation to the outside world. Personally I think real happiness is created when memories generate joy that later events cannot soil or touch.The only objections I could reasonably see are often spoken by the characters themselves, particularly the young man, who thinks the entire system is flawed; what do they do if a baby dies for instance? My own moment (and no I will not tell you nor anyone else) was actually quite corny, in fact it was the first time in my life I realized why a certain kind of sentimentality existed. This movie is sentimental for sure, but it's definitely sincere. If we get lucky in this universe and there is an Afterlife, we would all be very fortunate to find ourselves in a movie theaters like these with kind hearted counselors to help us grieve for and accept our lives, and if there isn't well at least there's still movies like Afterlife; things worth seeing, things worth talking about, and things worth sharing with each other.

Safer to say that most films these days know even less about the nature of death. A lot of movies about death are more interested in the celestial wallpaper. The afterlife on film is usually a perspective on what Heaven and Hell might look like and those who die are usually more interested in tying up romantic loose ends or returning to unfinished business. Very few films have ever matter-of-factly considered the afterlife from the point of view of the traveler who has crossed the threshold to the undiscovered country.Hirokazu Koreeda's Afterlife is almost alone in it's contemplation on the importance of the single moment or moments that shape our humanity. In 1999, Koreeda created this absolutely beautiful examination of the stopover between life and death where the choice of a lifetime must be made What single memory would you carry with you to your eternal reward? The examination is vessled by 22 travelers who, for various reasons, have died and arrive from a white light to a place that is neither here nor there. They are in a way-station between the end of life and their eternal lodgings. The counselors who work here meet and interview several recently dead people each week. The travelers are tasked with choosing one memory from a lifetime that they will carry over into the eternity that awaits them. Once a memory is selected it will be turned into a film and screened before the patron vanishes with the memory, all other memories having been eliminated.But what memory? What single memory is worth an eternity? Carrying the best memory would be heaven while surely carrying the worst would be hell. To that end the travelers find this a difficult task for various reasons. One man discovers that he has no memory that he wishes to carry on. Another discovers that he has too many. One decides that it was her experience on the Splash Mountain ride at Disneyland.We meet these people through interviews while the staff works diligently to create the productions for the films that will be screened. We learn very little about the staff who have apparently chosen to spend eternity at the station helping others select a memory. There is a moment when we come close, a connection between one of the patrons and the man who didn't think that he had a memory (of this I will leave you to discover). This moment provides one of the most emotional moments in the film and provides him with a reason for choosing the memory most precious to his heart.This is the most profound examination of the nature of humanity that I have ever seen on film. There are no special effects, no gimmickry, no scenes that are thrown together to hold our interest. This is a movie that very gently reaches out to those lucky enough to be caught up in it's contemplative spell and to be spellbound by it's message The message is that memory is all we have. No matter what financial or possessive objects we have gained in our lives our memories lie at the core of what makes us intelligent beings. It is the thing that connects our learning, our maturity and shapes our social connection. It is the core of our being, the connection point of our humanity.On the emotional level, the film works through contemplation, through imagining ourselves as the wayward patrons. The movie sees the selection process as very matter of fact. Koreeada is more interested in the people who have arrived here than in the place to which they have arrived. That spareness allows us to contemplate their process rather than their surroundings.I saw After Life shortly after it's initial release in 1999 and years later it still resonates in my mind. When I am idle, staring at the ceiling when sleep refuses to settle my mind, I contemplate the question posed by Koreeda's film and to this day I am nowhere near a decision. If I had to choose one memory it might be agony because my number of candidates would go as high as five hundred or if I wrote them down closer to a thousand. For that, I feel fortunate, fortunate and grateful that my life can contain that kind of contentment. If I am given the kind of task given to the people in After Life, it is my hope that whatever I settle on can be turned into a film that is as gentle, peaceful and affirming as Koreeda's beautiful work.

The plot is simple the newly dead are given a few days and some careful coaching by an attentive staff (who turn out to be dead, also)in order to select one memory to carry with them into eternity. That memory is then filmed and only after a communal screening, each dead soul may truly move on to whatever the afer life may be. This film explores not only the social shaping of our favorite memories (a silly teen girl first selects Disneyland, but then later prefers a tender everyday moment shared with her mother), but also it stresses the contingency of our memories - when the chosen memories are finally put onto film, each person has to accept a certain degree of compromise in the final product - their memories are perhaps as fictional, as artistically shaped as is this film itself. Most memorably, After Life offers an almost redemptive possibility perhaps unknowingly we serve as memories for others - our seemingly insignificant (and forgotten) actions may turn out to be a source of joy to someone else. I am leaving out a lot - the interactions between the dead and the staff, the relationships between staff members, the remarkably quality of the acting, the wonderful seedy beauty of the half-way place where the dead spend their last week, all of these elements are worthy of comment and praise, too.

Once in this limbo you have a week to choose a single memory, that is later recreated in film for you to keep, to take with you forever and all the rest of your life vanishes which as one person who we see choose says what a good idea to let your life be largely forgotten. The paradox is of course that as you watch this film memories come out of everywhere passed loves, childhood memories first day at school, immature early teen moments, regrets. That's why this film is difficult, not for anything in the film but for what you get out of it, and the difficulty you find concentrating on it, memories come from everywhere to interrupt the film and take you away from watching it. This is the first film I have ever seen that has been able to do this all the way through. Like some universal filmed diary; and I've seen this film twice now and it does every time and the same memories too! And if you've seen this and thought well it was all right I suppose, watch it again at a later date and it really does get much much better the second time; I can't wait for the third time I see it it'll probably become the best film I have ever seen.But the film itself once you've managed to push yet another of your own memories away long enough to actually concentrate on it is full of little wonderful tiny touches that just resonate in you.

The end is also particularly moving when we learn about one of the other workers there who help people decide what memory to keep with them. He is the star of the film without question his very distant and beautiful screen presence makes the end once you get to know who he is all the more difficult to watch the knowing that he eventually comes to terms with his life enough to be able move on, and his very simple film(memory) remains with you for a long time afterwards.

Some find it difficult to choose what was/is important, others don't want to, and for some it is so clear they don't need to choose. In this way the movie tells us the story of our lives that we live separately/alone, whilst believing/imagining we live it together with others. Who would you take with you, who would you leave behind?The film is very philosophical, but leaves a lot of phrases open for the viewer to fill in. And most important of all this is one of the movies which does not put a clear world-view/view of life on your lap that you either should accept completely or discard and not think about.

The films essence is reminiscing and our memories of our own life and its importance as to who we are.  For example, how much of what we recollect is even true or have we internally idealized it?

However, the last film I saw completely defies definition and therefore I can't answer that question. It was just Afterlife.Occasionally a film like this comes along with such a fantastic premise that it is completely unlike anything that has come before. It doesn't follow any of the well used paths trodden by previous pictures and is so unique that it cannot create a new genre, there's simply no bandwagon for anyone to jump on. The only thing it can possibly have in common with other films is its singularity; you could think of it as a Japanese 'Being John Malkovich'.The inspired question posed is if you could choose just one memory from your life that you would relive for eternity, what would it be? The film follows a group of people trying to decide on their own personal heaven and includes several diverse characters, showing how different each person is and even answering such questions as what if you couldn't or even wouldn't choose? Watching them re-examine their life is by turns poignant, upsetting and uplifting. Meanwhile the plot that maintains the film's momentum, involving the councillors who help people choose their nirvanal afterlife, is great and ensures that the film never loses direction.I would struggle to put into words exactly why this film has such an effect on me. It is a thought provoking concept so well delivered by all involved, with such a great examination of people and what makes them different or brings them together, and also brings up themes such as responsibility and the same event meaning different things to different people.

When I walked into the Roxie, on 16th between Valencia and Guerrero in SF, I was afraid to stop at the popcorn stand, and was concerned about who would be sitting next to me, and how they'd smell during the movie. The upholstery on the seats was this awful gold, worn out so that you could see the spongy stuff that makes up the chair. The lights went out. There were no previews, no dancing bit of 35mm film telling you that silence was golden, no flashing lights telling you to visit the popcorn stand, nothing. There wasn't even a studio clip introducing the movie to let you know that it started. It just started out with the producers and then the title. From that moment on, I forgot that I was in a horrible movie theater. I forgot that I had to move twice before finding a seat far enough away from the guy who probably hadn't bathed in days. I was so mesmerized by what was to follow, that when the lights came back on, I was actually sad to be back in reality. The film is After Life and is directed by sophomore filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda. No real movie stars, that I'm aware of, just some magnificent performances, in a memorable film, to be sure. Just what is this all about? If you are a people-watcher, then this is your type of movie. When you die, you go to purgatory. We've all heard this concept before. But, purgatory is not some place of nothingness. Nor is it someplace with fire spewing below you or cold winds freezing above you. Instead, purgatory is a nice Japanese hotel where you are allowed to think, and reflect upon your life. You arrive on Monday, and you are given three days to think about your most precious memory of your entire life. This one memory will be the sole thing that you will be allowed to carry into your next life, and it will be filmed by the counselors/actors who reside at Hotel Purgatory. On Saturday, you will be allowed to view your memory, at which point you will instantaneously be sent to your next life. What follows is an engrossing, somewhat voyeuristic journey through various people's lives. So touching are the vivid portrayals of the people's memories. This film covers a lot of bases about choosing one single memory to represent your own life, but it also is quite amusing to see the challenges of the purgatory film crew to film your memory. This movie is evocative of the great Italian movie, Cinema Paradiso, in many respects-it's an homage to the movies, yes; but, it also speaks of universal truths such as nature, life and love, and things most close to us.The actors do an admirable job in portraying their characters, and it's interesting to see and hear the philosophy of how the after life works, in this writer's mind. As it turns out, the writer is also the director-which makes sense, because the world, or afterworld, in which we are submerged is so singular, that much of it would be lost in any writer-director transition. This director also has some great camera angles, and his use of sound and silence makes such strong statements. There are certain Akira Kurosawaian elements in this film; but, not all the deft direction is inherited from The Master. This film is also a great film to take someone to and then go to a caf√©. Okay, granted-there aren't many great caf√©s by the Roxie, so bring a car. But when the film is over, it's something that you can talk about for hours, days, weeks.. What would be the one memory that you would take with you to your next life, if it had to be now? Has there been any one defining moment of your life? Have you had enough life experience to claim such a memory, or has everything that you've done so far been done to create a memory for the future? Four Stars. Josh Bob says check it out.

A number of non-actors were told to select a cherished memory, and the producers would produce a movie of that memory for them, and the producers would make a documentary-style movie of the production of their movies. However, they were not told any other details of the movie. That is why several of the characters' memories and the filming process are so deeply personal, and their descriptions are so clear.

I have labored over my one simple experience that I would want to live forever and it escapes me...I always imaged something that I wondered how could one, however, brilliant duplicate that experience for me.  Most of the images from the movie as I recollect were isolated people without relation to other people...so there was never any request for an experience that connected one person to another.  I course I was going through some pretty horrible times and the reaching out to that someone...but still.

I can't argue with that. But I will say that such a dismissal of this movie's content seems to me to indicate a real failure of empathy Are folks so hung up on novelty, on the extraordinary, that they can't see any beauty at all in a perfectly humdrum life? (What about your life, or mine?) Are the only people worth caring about all full-color glossy hundred-foot-high superstars?For me it's not boring or disappointing that, say, the indecisive gentleman chooses to sit on a park bench for eternity with his wife. Return to his decision in your mind for a moment What is it saying? I think it's a comment not on the afterlife but on just how little will do in the here and now, how little we'll wake up for in the morning, how absolutely unkillable our hope for ourselves is, how abjectly we devote ourselves to enduring our lives even when there's no reward waiting for us. It's saying that any tiny moment, no matter how empty it may seem, can contain enough to sustain us forever.Can contain enough what? I can't say, exactly. Under this movie's quiet surfaces, it seems desperately urgent to answer that question Enough what? Yes, yes, it says, this is what your life is made of! Frowning at newspapers and sitting on trains and eating hundreds of breakfasts in silence. This is it! So what does it mean? What is it for? Better make it mean something, because no one else can do that for you. Nobody's waiting to buy the film rights to your last fight with your girlfriend, father, roommate, whatever. Nobody cares what your favorite song is. Nobody cares how you feel whenever you walk past that one willow tree, where the two of you kissed for the last time.That's the mercilessness at the core of this otherwise very tender and beautiful story You mean nothing. Nobody means anything. You have to look inside yourself and choose to cherish something, any damn thing, because otherwise you might as well be dead already.I don't know.

The key plot point of the movie is that everyone spends eternity in endless contemplation of one perfect moment from their lives. This notion differs drastically from the western emphasis on variety as the spice of life -- or death.  Compare Wim Wenders' film, UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD, in which a group of westerners are emotionally and intellectually crippled by having to sort through their inmost thoughts and memories.Our hell is usually depicted as a place where one must carry out pointless repetitive tasks or where one is forced into an obsession with the past (as in WHAT DREAMS MAY COME); heaven is usually thought of as listening to music, living in palaces, and socializing with a wide array of friends and loved ones.  The Buddhist heaven suggested by this movie comes all too close to resembling a Sartrian hell in a westerner's eyes.  Thus most American filmgoers would have no idea what the story was hoping to convey by insisting on the choice of a single cherished memory.  Those with an interest in a different perspective may find the film thought-provoking.It's less clear what the movie is getting at by suggesting that the afterlife is a place where people must make movies of their lives on limited budgets and with inadequate props.  Perhaps the filmmaker is merely making a joke about filmmaking.  Or perhaps he's trying to suggest that film is the ultimate artistic format, most closely tied to people's actual experiences of life.  A little movie magic is all that's necessary to capture the gist of reality, even if the technical aspects of production seem cheap and mundane.  Either way, the filmmaking references are likely to be lost on mainstream audiences.Even when judged as a Japanese film, the movie is successful primarily when it relies on actual documentary interviews with old folks.  Listening to these non-actors trying to describe the best memories of their lives is absolutely fascinating, whereas the drama narrated by the film is considerably less engaging.

The premise of the movie is simple over the span of a week, twenty-two souls arrive at a way station (which looks like an old junior high school) between life and death, where they are asked to choose just one memory to take into the afterlife. The new arrivals include an elderly woman, a rebellious dropout, a teenage girl, and a 70-year-old war veteran. Once they have chosen a memory, it is recreated and filmed by the staff of the way station, using all the tricks and illusions of cinema cotton balls are used to mimic clouds, a fan is used for a summer breeze.The movie is set in a building resembling a decrepit travel lodge or social services institution. Every Monday, a new group of recently deceased people check in, and the social workers in the lodge explain to each guest their situation. The newly-dead have until Wednesday to identify the single happiest memory. For the rest of the week, the workers at the institution work to design and replicate each person's chosen memory, thereby replicating the single happiest moment of that person's life, and it is filmed.At the end of the week, the recently deceased watch the films of their recreated happiest memories in a screening room. As soon as each person sees his or her own memory, he or she vanishes to whatever unknown state of existence lies beyond and takes only that single memory with them, to live and relive for eternity.The story revolves around two of the counselors, Takashi and Shiori . Takashi has been assigned to help an old man, Ichiro,select his memory. Takashi reviews videotape of Ichiro's life and learns that Ichiro had married Takashi's former fianc√©e after Takashi had been killed during World War II. Takashi has Ichiro assigned to another counselor, but is still troubled by his memories, causing both him and his quasi-romantic interest Shiori to re-examine their afterlivesThis film is not a typical Hollywood feel-good film; but its unhurried pace and lack of melodrama, like its subject, may linger in the memory long afterwards that viewers may engage in a discussion about this movie.With its meditative, humanistic tone, it is the cinematic reminiscence of limbo itself, this transitional space of contemplation and nostalgia.Finally,it is an affecting and unpredictable film that lingers on one's mind long after viewing.In short,it is one special film.

RIP.Good film, a good life in general, is not just about a view of the ocean, that may be beautiful one day but stormy the next. Good film is reflections on the waters of the moon that adjusts the tides. This is a recurrent insight of Zen among other things, and you can't be a Japanese filmmaker and not respond to the conundrum posed by Zen, even if it means outright rejection (as many Japanese New Wave-ers did). So it is not just a view, life isn't, it is both reflection and mechanisms that control the view, and these mechanisms entail motion and flow, and that flow is only near the surface the everyday narrative of life. The conundrum? You have to express complicated in-sight with a simple view.This guy, Koreeda, is still in his early steps here, but wants the adventure. In Maborosi, he chiseled a bit at the transcendent flow, even if it came across as a simple homage to Ozu it was good work. This time he challenges himself with layered narrative.He's still in his early steps means, in our case, that the mechanisms are entirely movielike, usually they are. The premise is that a group of people die and come to a house where each one will have to settle on a single memory to carry with them to eternity, this is the part that references old Hollywood fantasy (A Matter of Life and Death, the Capra Christmas staple also referenced in the title).The French touch (most notably Resnais and Marker) each memory is going to be made into a film, and films are going to be screened for the audience in a way that they grant transcendence. Each film poses a challenge to the crew, so the filmmakers have to seriously puzzle how to film a flight on ground level, the sound of darkness, or the simplest thing, the feel of a summer breeze. Another problem is that others won't or can't even choose their film.In new Hollywood hands, say Jonze's, this would be done with an abundance of quirks and forced cleverness. One or the other from the usual group of selfaware actors - Julianne Moore, Seymour Hoffman, Malkovich - would be likely brought around to be the center of multiple overlapping vision. We'd get a big, complex synecdoche of the various threads, that is in line with the Western understanding of life as a complicated narrative.But, this is Japanese and derives all its power from subtle flow in the view one aspect of this, is that we never see the actual transcendent films except a few glimpses, and only glimpses of them being put together, usually involving camera set-up and rehearsals from memory. The action often takes place in some blurred foreground. See, it was never about the actual films as vaguely artistic tokens. It was about sculpting a feel that guides you back to the light, and that is left entirely in our sphere of having discovered our cherished moment, and rehearsed that moment as the film provides the framework of cinematic space around it. It is pure Zen cultivating the air you breathe.The other aspect is that we have actual people reminiscing. Oh, some of it was staged, some of it real, but you can't know most of the time and there's no point to that. It matters that all of it impresses as a seamless flow of graceful reminiscence.I'd have liked less obviously scripted romance and more of these people and filming the air, which is one of the coveted memories anyway, but Koreeda probably needed a safe anchor he could control using ordinary - dramatic - means. That should be his next adventure.I recently discovered a wonderful Russian film a bit like this, that one a documentary, this one ostensibly a drama, but the boundaries are slippery, about aged ballet dancers in their 80's and 90's conducting between them a wonderful ballet of remembrance. It felt graceful because the people telling their story were, and each breath from that story infused the cinematic air, and so it is here, except in a much more quietly ordinary way, since the people are ordinary.Chris Marker would have liked both, I like to think. He did his own film about a Russian filmmaker reminiscing on a journey of staged dreams and fleeting memories. It's called The Last Bolshevik, the Russian documentary is Ballets Russes. You should look them up.And so it comes full circle.

He somehow makes an enormously unlikely scenario for purgatory - where the dead are asked to select the memory they wish to hold onto forever, and (most unlikely!), this is recreated by a ramshackle low budget film crew, and turns it into something profound and beautiful. The film is a truly remarkable ensemble effort - there are no real stars in this film (despite a beautiful minor part from that truly great actress, Kyoko Kagawa), even the most minor characters (including an adorable old lady in the throes of a mercifully pleasant dementia) are given their own time and space and are depicted wonderfully. Dull looking salarimen who struggle to find memories that are worth keeping are shown to have lives of real depth and quality. A schoolgirl is dissuaded from a clich√©d remembrance of a nice day in Disneyland, and instead remembers a beautiful moment with her mother. A mouthy, sex obsessed older man is shown to be boastful simply as a way of hiding the real love he has for his daughter. The film is obviously open to all sorts of interpretations, but for what its worth it seems to me to be about the importance of those small moments of joy, of grace, that make life worth living. Interestingly, he implies that those moments don't necessarily have to have really happened - it is the memory that is important, not the reality. Just one moment of ecstasy is maybe just enough for a life worth living.The film sounds quirky and slow, and it is paced at the speed of life - slow, but all too fast at the end. But it is never less than engrossing and in the end, beautiful and moving. Kore- edas films are not disposable entertainment, they are real art of the type that will stay with you forever if you allow them to wash over you. Try it, you won't regret it.

However, it does come as a surprise because few films really go with the idea and aim for something special and unique. Few films are like the wonderful After Life.This Japanese movie provides viewers with a very particular interpretation of just what happens to people when they die but it uses the premise to remind everyone of the joys of life and love and small pleasures. Think of Amelie with ghosts and without the added sweetness that many seem to resent and you're getting closer.It turns out that when you die you don't go to heaven or hell. You go to a building full of counsellors who are all there to help you with the one, most important, thing - picking your favourite ever memory and recreating it for you. Because then, and only then, can you move on and you will keep that one memory with you forever. Nothing else.Written and directed by Hirokazu Koreeda, After Life is a movie that really captures fleeting moments and feelings quite unlike most other movies. Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind came to life, as did It's A Wonderful Life, as did Perfume The Story Of A Murderer and Amer (as much as I disliked that one). This movie just somehow manages to turn the ethereal, intangible fabric of memories and sensations into things that you can feel emanating from the screen.I was about to go to great lengths to check out just who was who in the acting credits and to overcome my ignorance of those involved but that would be a bit pointless in this instance because a) my ignorance seems to grow, exponentially and paradoxically, with my knowledge and b) everyone is just perfect so it's quite impossible to single anyone out. Erika Oda and Arata seem to get many of the better moments but Susumu Terajima, Kei Tani and everyone portraying a dead person struggling to pick a perfect memory all do brilliant work.Gentle, moving, effective and yet not dripping with false sweetness and emotional manipulation, After Life really is something quite special and well worth seeking out.

Unfortunately, I am not one to give up on things, but I was in pain for it to end. I had hoped it would have some redeeming quality.The premise of the film is certainly a novel thought as far as movie plots go. I have often found foreign film plots to have more substance and reality than many of the American films. The plot reminds me of someone who is going to have Alzheimer's except they can retain one memory. To me, Alzheimer's is s very disturbing form of existence. Basically our hereafter is a loss of memory with only one thought in tack. The other reviews that I read tend to avoid this literal interpretation and speak of increasing our own perspective of life and I can see that. I thank them for sharing their interpretation. Some of the things we attach ourselves are trivial in scheme of things and this is a great awareness, I just didn't get that from the movie. I guess, I have more of a question about our perspectives than the movie. How is it that we can watch the same movie and range from excitement to sheer boredom. I do love the diversity of this world, so for those who get indignant when someone doesn't agree, just let it go.I suppose I was looking for meaning in the movie and only found a greater meaning in the reviews.

Some find the process quite hard while others are easily able to figure things out. As in real life, we begin to see the examination of life's principle tenet that who we are is really a summation of how we live. One thing I appreciated about this movie is that, other than the main actors, the wayfaring actors are just regular people with no acting skills and you just fall in love with their idiosyncrasies, quirks, and genuine reactions.

He is introduced as a seemingly average individual; one who does not attract much attention let alone curiosity. In fact, my attention was originally geared heavily towards Watanabe's story simply because his struggle to choose a favorite memory evoked a lot of interest and mind participation. Contrariwise, Mochizuki seemed to possess no inner conflict that was worthy of inquiry, although his outer conflict, too, at first seemed mildly intriguing (i.e. having to help Watanabe find a memory). Ironically, however, as the beauty of Watanabe's character unraveled, it carefully led to the discovery and beauty of Mochizuki's character.Both of their worlds merged together during private interview sessions, creating long awaited answers and long lost harmonies between their pasts. They learn in one particular session that they both share the same dilemma the battle to choose a perfect memory. In addition to sharing the same dilemma, they also share the same generation as well as lover (Kyoko). With these discoveries, they both become, in a sense, the symbol of overlapping ovals portrayed on the institution's flag; a metaphor for how it takes two people earnestly involved in the other's life to discover self-identity. Each needs the other and each becomes part of the other person's discovery of happiness.Given these revelations into Mochizuki's past, his character suddenly becomes incredibly dynamic and provocative; one who is on the same empathetic level as Watanabe. We learn that he is not simply at the institution to help others find their memories, but that the entire staff, including himself, is placed in counseling positions because they themselves never chose a memory to live with for eternity. It would seem, then, that the staff is being poetically revealed by the director as restless beings living in purgatory.The idea of restlessness and inner turmoil (in the staff) is illustrated by the contrasts of camera movement. In the beginning, most of the shots are static and evenly framed. We are observing the majority of shots through the staff's eyes, which gives the film a documentary type lens (especially during the interviews). As a result, this type of camera-work creates the illusion of making the audience think that the staff is well-balanced and in control, both internally and externally. After all, they are the ones with the camera and choose how to focus the shots during interviews. The irony of this, however, is later exposed when we learn that each staff member's progression towards heaven is stultified because they never chose a memory&#151;hence their positions as staff members. As soon as we learn this (which if I recall happens on Thursday) the camera-work becomes more hand-held, shaky and off kilter.This contrast in camera-work becomes even more beautiful and poignant because it also reflects the two stages that the staff undergoes during both preproduction and production of those whose lives they wish to change. In preproduction, they gather all the material they need from the recently deceased (via interviews) in order to recreate their memories on film. The preproduction sequences (the interviews) are shot with well balanced and controlled frames (perhaps an expression of the more controlled side of film-making). As the staff travels into the actual production of recreating their guests' memories, the camera-work then turns towards the more shaky and imbalanced frames (perhaps an expression of the more difficult and chaotic part of film-making the actual shooting itself).It was as if the camera was making a philosophical commentary on the nature of freewill and its relation to heaven and hell. That is, to choose explicitly one's destiny (or in this case, one's memory) means to live a well balanced, evenly framed existence; and contrariwise, to explicitly not choose one's destiny, but to neutrally balk on the sidelines means to live an existence of uncertainty and imbalance.This leads now to the reason I chose Mochizuki. Unlike most who surround him, he willingly chooses to end his inner pain by realizing (with the help of others) that true happiness is not found by dwelling upon one's own memories, but by being a part of some else's memories. When asked about his earliest memory, he recalls an intense and vivid memory of snow. Snow is a symbol of his rebirth; the delicate and soft coat that whitens out his previous life and gives birth to his new life&#151;a life that he was only able to discover through the people he met at the institution, and more especially his relationship with Watanabe. The memory he chooses, then, becomes his realization into the insight of what happiness is; a simple moment that came full circle into his mind as he sat on a nostalgic park bench thinking about those in whom he loved.

This memory is reproduced on film in true low-budget fashion, then as the film is screened each person disappears into the great beyond as their memory is played. The conflicts arises out of the different ways those passing through choose what memory to take with them and the experiences of the staff.This is probably the most accessible of director Koreeda's films, especially for a Western audience. His low-key directorial style is expertly matched to the tone of the film, which is set in an abandoned school. The sort of running gag throughout the film is the general shabbiness of the proceeding, which stands in stark contrast with what many of us might imagine the hereafter to be like. In one scene, where the staff tries to reproduce a man's memory of flying in an airplane, cotton balls suspended on wires serve as clouds.Overall this is a very poignant, low-key yet satisfying film that is very watchable and a good gateway into the world of Koreeda's films. It lacks the social commentary of other works such as Distance or Nobody Knows, but makes up for it with a touching story and emotional content, and is very accessible even to those with little interest in foreign or Japanese films.

This film should be compulsory viewing for film students. It proves that a good story put together inventively is all it takes to produce a compelling film. With scarce resources and mostly non-professional actors, Kore-eda has ingeniously contrived an alternate reality, where people go at the time of death. No pearly gates, no angels, no hell-fire - just bureaucrats in government buildings (or so they seemed to this writer), processing the dead, and extracting from them their lives' fondest memories to be made into videos.This idea is almost comical, yet it works beautifully. Clearly there's a humorous element, but Kore-eda plays it matter-of-fact serious, almost like a documentary. For me it strongly recalls some of the early fiction films of Kieslowski (like Camera Buff) which evolved out of the documentary format. The film shares the beautifully raw aesthetics of Camera Buff and Blind Chance and with the latter's metaphysical exploration. Having seen at MIFF all but one of Kore-eda's films (Distance, which I plan to see on Tuesday), this is my favourite so far. But each of the films I have seen thus far are very different in content and style to each other. This film is both enjoyable and moving.

Does one's soul ascend to heaven, descend to hell, or is it reincarnated into yet another earthly form? Does an individual simply cease to exist after he or she dies? In Kore-eda's second feature length film Afterlife one goes to a way station where one selects his or her favorite memory to be filmed and then one takes that memory and that memory alone to one's final destination.In order to help individuals decide which memory to keep counselors help individuals comb through their lives to find important memories. Many of the individuals, of course, select times from their childhoods as their best memories. One man selects a summer day in which he rode a tram and enjoyed the scenery and the cool breeze that blew through the window. A radiant older woman chooses a time in which she was dressed in a red, Western dress and danced for her older brother and dined on chicken rice afterwards. One bitter man chooses a time in his life when he had a small fort and was able to hide away from the world.On its surface Afterlife might seem a bit hokey and one wonders why spirits have to create videos of their memories, they also eat and drink, to take to the next world. However, isn't it true that are life experiences are nothing but memories and besides the current moment we live everything else is a memory? Kore-eda, whose other feature length films Maboroshi and Distance focus on death and memory and memory as well, delves into mankind's worry of being forgotten. One character in the film, an older man who considers every aspect of his life to be so-so, is reluctant to select a memory because he does not believe that he had a life affirming moment that will be remembered by others, but, as one of the counselors states very few people do.Slow moving, darkly filmed, and melancholy Afterlife is a deep film that takes an interesting stance to life and death and makes one reflect on one's own life and those small moments that makes each of us who we are.

Ask yourself, can anyone truly remember every last detail of a memory? Don't we alter it, don't we change certain things, we want to remember what we WANT to remember, and leave certain things out that may not be important to us personally.At best, a memory is a subjective and fragmented interpretation of an experience.

The first part is filmed like a documentary, with fixed camera, style professional interviews. The second part uses hand-held camera, looking as the amateur films would have looked like. Actors are wonderful, there are many different characters, but each one is an individual, and that feeling of 'all look the same' that an European viewer has many times with Asian films is not present here at all.

Are you transported to a state of eternal happiness or do you spend the rest of eternity in damnation? The Abrahamic religious view of the afterlife is very black and white. It leaves little room for the imagination. However, non-Western cultures have different concepts of the afterlife. Through watching various anime and reading graphic novels, I've come to the conclusion that the Japanese, at least partially, may view the afterlife as determined by the individual. In After Life, (the English title) Hirokazu Kore-eda elaborates on this concept. In the film, people attend a camp to determine which of their many memories they wish to keep before departing to the afterlife. They crew at the camp reacts this memory into a mini-film and the recently deceased live with this memory for the rest of eternity.After Life employs non-actors for the majority of the screen time. These people have no formal training, which makes their lines appear all the more genuine. When they speak, their words have an honesty about them which cannot be staged. Something remarkable about the film is that it doesn't distinguish its characters by developing them, but with the unique nature of the memories they have. Furthermore, their memories are realistic and touching. Some people wish to cherish the memory of a lover; while others (especially those who were young when they died) choose a memory of childhood. A prominent theme is the comforting effect that memory has for individuals.The staff at the unnamed camp is the most mysterious of all. We are not told why they are there, but once we think more of the film's premise. The staff is composed of those who could not choose a memory and remain there to guide others to afterlife. Are they condemned live in a purgatory-state of anxiety or are have they chosen to remain there? The film offers a slight answer to this query, but it isn't necessary. The means by which it does this is the interaction of a staff member with an arrival. We learn that some of the staff wishes to take responsibility for their actions by not forgetting them.Kore-eda treats the question he proposes with much earnestly. He doesn't present anything to distract this message. There is no antagonist other than the people themselves. This does much for the film's credibility. There is no problem with the progression of the plot, nor is there a plot hole. Some criticize the film because the dead attendees sleep, eat, and why must the memory be recreated. If someone you know reads a review and asks you this, suggest that they shouldn't the film. Such petty criticism is unjustified. The film doesn't attempt to convince us of its reality. Kore-eda wants to show us his idea, and he adds these scenes to help us identify with the workers. This is why the leader reminds the others that they shouldn't become attached to the patrons.How can a film with no protagonist, no character development, and no special effects be so warmly received? After Life is able to do this because it takes a different approach to entertaining its audience. It presents an actual topic (death) and elaborates on its idea of what happens thereafter. This approach mimics the technique used by several documentaries. The end result is the viewer's satisfaction in having watched director Kore-eda's proposal of the afterlife. One may fastidiously criticize the non-essential scenes of the film, but this criticism ignores the existential question the film proposes. While few will see this film, those who do will recall the experience vividly. The film distinguishes itself by analyzing a concept with no superlatives.

So I ordered the DVD of After Life sight unseen, and watched it the other night. I was not quite as impressed by it as by Maborosi, mainly because of the ending of After Life, which seemed a bit contrived and unnecessary to me.  Actually, I could have wished the film to consist merely of the interviews that occupy much of the beginning third or so of the film.  (And I learned from Roger Ebert's review that some of the interviews are the real thing, though the viewer is not privileged to know which.  That explains why I was sometimes thinking as I watched, I can't believe this is an actor!)Still, despite some weakness, I found this a powerful film, especially up till the final twenty minutes or so.  As in Maborosi, Mr. Kore-eda treats his subjects (real or fictional) with the utmost dignity and with what seems to me a very rare compassionate insight, warmed with humor of the gentlest sort.  His humanist outlook is extremely unusual in this day and age and is what, along with a phenomenally sensitive eye for composition, lighting, and color, signal to me that this is one of the most important filmmakers to come along in a long time.There's a a sudden revelation at one point in the film of just why the caseworkers are doing their tedious, onerous job.  You're wondering about it till, casually, in conversation, the truth slips out.  This was such a shocking moment for me that tears literally flowed down my face!  Oh, my God, I exclaimed aloud.  I wonder if audiences in theaters gasped at that moment...Highly, highly recommended.  Both this film and Maborosi are the kind of work that cannot help but change your view of life in some way.  For me, they serve as a reminder that there is goodness in people that I tend, in my unfortunately cynical middle age, to overlook.

The group gets an assignment which is to choose only one memory they don't want to loose.

The director Hirokazu interviewed many people on the streets of Tokyo and ask them the question of the movie If you could bring just one memory with you to the hereafter what would that memory be? By asking this question to so many people Hirokazu made it hard for himself. Hirokazu got the most beautiful stories from the people and the difficult thing now was to select a good number of stories without damaging the plot. I personally think the director here failed. The movie has too many stories which leads to an overkill. The movie is almost 2 hours long where 90min. was enough.

Within the first 20 minutes, your brain will light up like a Christmas tree as you think of the implications and how you would react in a similar situation. It has the magical ability to awaken nostalgic memories of your own, and several times I had to pause the film so that I could indulge my own private thoughts for a while. Hats off to the director/writer for achieving the necessary balance between fantasy and realism (i.e., taking you to a surreal place whilst not destroying the human perspective).But the downside... I feel that the director failed to cultivate some of the excellent philosophies which were barely touched upon. This could have been accomplished with more dialogue. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of *talking* in the movie, but it's mostly anecdotal (people wistfully reminiscing about the past). There wasn't enough analysis and barely any *dialogue* (people communicating with each other).Without ruining anything, I'll give you one example. The premise is, of course, if you had to pick one memory to relive forever, which would you choose? One character simply refuses to pick. This is brilliant. As soon as he takes his position, which he does in the first 10 minutes of the film, it woke me up and made me wonder why he would choose this unconventional act of defiance.But much to my disappointment, this central theme is abandoned. The character is hardly seen again. He does deliver an interesting monologue towards the end which is encapsulated in a single powerful statement he says (I won't tell you what it is). But I couldn't help feeling as if the director didn't really follow through with his philosophy.Perhaps that was the intent of the director to present us only with fragments so that we may ponder the philosophy ourselves. But that approach somewhat betrays the nature of art. Art, I believe, should do its best to communicate a complete idea, and *then* open up the floor for discussion. Anything less is a mere Rorshach test. Or whatever you call those inkblot thingees that psychologists use to probe your mind.As you can probably guess, I'm not a big fan of the Minimalist movement.Another gripe... Some of the interesting philosophical points were shoved aside to make room for the romantic sub-plot, which I found to be a bit forced and unbelievable. I would have preferred to see the director stick to the heavier issues. If this is truly a film about deep spirituality, why dedicate so much time to a teenage girl's crush on a guy?So my overall criticism is that there wasn't enough substance presented. I admit there IS the possibility that the dialogue/philosophy I craved was lost in translation. It is possible that the English subtitles didn't convey the philosophy inherent in the original Japanese. That's been known to happen.But still, I think this film could have truly benefited by a good old fashioned Shakespearian soliloquy, like Hamlet Act III Sc 1, to help clarify the director's message.Well, here I've wasted my whole review babbling about philosophy, and I haven't touched upon the technical merits of this film. Let me just wrap up by reiterating that THIS IS A GOOD FILM despite my criticism. I love the way the director achieved a surreal feeling without using gimmicky, schlocky clich√©s like pearly gates and angels and pixie dust. Everything about the production is firmly rooted in reality despite the very unrealistic nature, and that achieves a very bizarre and clever paradox. Also there's no music at all.

So basically the dead spirits are in a hotel until they pick a memory and move on. Also the memory is shown to the spirits through videotapes.

After Life takes an intriguing, even profound, idea--what do we take with us (memories and the like) when we pass over to the other side--then proceeds to develop it in an utterly shoddy fashion. This more like the rough draft for the actual film than the film itself.I mean, really--putting together a high school-play quality reproduction of the memory instead of the memory itself? And that the social workers at this hereafter way station are there because they haven't yet chosen their memories? (Maybe after having seen the cheesy way they're constructed, they don't want that to happen to them.)For those who haven't seen the film, the general idea is this. The recently deceased arrive at a facility on the way to their final destination for one week and are given a few days to decide on the one memory they can take with them to their permanent afterlife. Once they have chosen it, the way station crew re-enacts it, films it, then screens it for the afterlife travelers to take with them. Those who don't declare a memory cannot pass on and are fated to become facility workers.I'll admit that during the screening I found myself thinking about which memory I'd take with me. I'm sure many others did the same. But then I began thinking about this movie, and the memories are not pleasant.First of all, it is set at what looks like a shabby, abandoned university. (I was reminded of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy when earthman Arthur Dent, upon first glance of the inside of his first alien spaceship, which happens to be the messy living quarters of the cooks and stewards, remarks, It's a bit squalid, isn't it?) The staff of this way station are essentially social workers, most of them oddly young, while their cases come in all ages. But never do we learn how most of them died, nor do we learn their attitude towards having died. The older ones we can assume expected it as natural cause, but what about the younger ones, like the teenage girl? Don't they feel cheated? If not, why not?This whole premise was better presented by Albert Brooks in Defending Your Life and much more hilariously stated by Tim Burton in Beetlejuice where Sylvia Sydney, having committed suicide, is condemned to spent eternity as a social worker.Then there's the problem of why this after life crew has to recreate the memory for each traveler. First off, they often cannot match exactly the circumstances of each memory, which alters it on a literal, material level, but even if the memory were matched exactly, isn't that really a new memory (a metamemory, if you will) that merely recalls the original? What's the point of that? Or is that the point? Maybe Koreeda wants us to meditate on these questions, but his presentation is frankly so mediocre that I found myself ruminating on his flawed methodology instead.I'll wrap up by noting that the movie drags on after its conclusion in an attempt to tie up loose ends that weren't addressed during the previous acts. After Life had an intriguing premise, but Koreeda presented it poorly.On the IMDb scale, I gave it 4 stars out of 10, and those mostly for broaching thoughtful material.Darryl  "},{"Title":"Terribly disappointing","Date":"31 May 1999","Score":"5 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy","Review":"  This film is a critical darling, I listened to Roger Ebert call it one of the years best.

Along with `Eyes Wide Shut', `After Life' illustrates the simple wisdom that an interesting idea alone is not a guarantee of a good film. By some reason, unknown to me, if something is slightly different from the Hollywood gloss and schmaltz, it is always proclaimed brilliant and refreshing. `After Life ` is about a group of recently deceased people who are required to choose the fondest reminiscences of their lives. I understand, that in most cases people would choose little things that they hold dear but that may be of no interest to anyone else. Still, a good half of the film is devoted to extremely boring conversations shot in documentary style. I also understand that this is a fantasy but even a fantasy or a dream has its internal logic. If this place is not real and set in afterlife so why does it look like an old school or hospital building? Don't they have enough funds to repaint it? Why these &#145;afterlife social workers' try to re-stage people's memories on what looks like a low-budget film set if they could easily obtain videotapes of a person's whole life? (That is what they actually do in the case of one man who can't decide which memories to choose.) Where do those &#145;actors', used in the filming of people's memories, come from and where do they go afterwards? If all the people in the film are dead why do they need to drink tea, to sleep or to read? The film leaves a discerning viewer wondering about all this but it fails to give any answers.

This attitude is not much different than saying that every big budget action flick must be good.After Life is a perfect example of how an art house flick can fail.  A good picture must have meaning AND be well put together.  A film that has meaning but is poorly put together is no better than a film that is well done but has no meaning.  After Life is an example of the first.Sure After Life is based on an interesting idea - what one memory would you like to keep for all eternity - but it is very poorly put together.  Scenes are long and boring, extending on for several minutes when a minute would do.  After a while, scenes grow highly repetitive.  The plot development is so ridiculously slow that the viewer could easily fall asleep for 20 minutes and miss nothing.I'll give credit to After Life for making the viewer think, but as stated before a movie must also be well put together.  The single sentence If you could choose only one memory to keep forever, what would it be? invokes as much thought as this movie.**Warning minor spoilers ahead**Furthermore, the movie is so full of clich√©s it is hard to believe anyone could find it inventive or insightful.  For example, there is the old man who chooses a memory of sitting with his wife alone on a park bench.  Sadly, this character was the main focus of the movie.  Other characters are nearly as cliched.  The film professes to have some great insight on life, but ends up saying very little.  To remember ones friends, it argues, is what is really important.  In conclusion, After Life is a perfect example of how an art house film can suck.  It takes nearly 2 hours to state what could be said in a couple sentences.  The film fails to draw the viewer in, as it rambles on and on.  After Life might have meaning, but has very little else.  Overall, one would be much better off talking with real people about their favorite memories than watching this extremely long and boring film.

That idea in itself is decent at best. But the execution of the movie was rather poor. You get to hear a bunch of Japanese people reminise about their lives. Yawn If I wanted to go hear people reminise about their lives I'd go to a nursing home.The basic idea is that once you pick you memory they make a video tape of it. HUH??? You're dead. You're in the afterlife. But the only way of preserving a memory is making some garbage flik about it using circa 1965 video equipment? What would happen to those who died before videocameras were around. Plot holes abound in this movie.There are two main parts of the movie. The first I already mentioned is about the Joe Schmoes who talk about what memory they want. The second is about the staff members (who work there for a special reason) who are all of course 20-somethings. You get a bleh plot about them figuring out their memory.So if you want to see a slow, boring drama about a bunch of Japanese people then I guess this is your flik. Otherwise, don't waste your time or money.

The philosophical concept was interesting, and it is that that led me to enjoy the first 5 minutes of the movie. But, after the initial concept was revealed 5 minutes into the movie, I found the rest of the move to be completely boring. It amazes me that so many people rated this movie highly. I truly don't see the entertainment value in the movie that the others reviewers have seen in it (it is currently rated a 7.7, and that blows me away). Being engaged in an interactive philosophical conversation on what occurs in one's afterlife is entertaining, as is watching a GOOD movie on afterlife such as the sixth sense. But thhis movie, Afterlife, is just plain slow and boring. "}]
