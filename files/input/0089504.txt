Albert Brooks and Julie Hagerty are perfect as the classic yuppie couple that decide to set out on the open road after a series of strange circumstances. Brooks' rave-out on his boss at the beginning of the film is priceless, as is his interaction with the unemployment office worker in the midwest... I'll just check my $100,000 a year job file. Brooks is also great when he tries to reason with the casino owner, and arguing with Hagerty over her inability to use the words nest and egg. From now on, birds live in ROUND STICKS!!!, for breakfast, you will have THINGS over easy!!!!Most of the best dialogue and scenes are delivered from Brooks, but Hagerty is quite good as well, as the timid wife whos honest, yet HUGE blunder sets the tone for the rest of the film. My only complaint is that it seemed about a half hour too short. When they decide to return to New York, I would've allowed one more wacky situation on the way back home, but it was not to be. It left me feeling that the ending was a bit rushed. But this is a minor complaint from a great film that deserves to be seen over and over.

In `Lost In America,' the writer-director-star weaves an hilarious tapestry that is no less than a paean to an entire generation of Yuppies.  When David Howard (Brooks), the creative director for one of the largest advertising agencies in the world, fails to get the promotion he's `waited his whole life for,' he quits his job (`Well, I got fired, but it's the same thing&#150;'), then convinces his wife, Linda (Julie Hagerty), to do the same.  They then proceed to sell their house, liquidate all their assets (`We got a ride on the inflation train you would not believe,'), buy a thirty-foot motor home and drop out of society in order to `find' themselves.  Patterning himself after the guys in `Easy Rider,' David's plan is for them to set off across America, to `Touch Indians, see the mountains and the prairies and all the rest of that song,' and they leave Los Angeles with a new motor home, a substantial nest egg and an anxious sense of adventure.  It all soon goes awry, of course, and what follows are some of the funniest scenes you'll ever see in an intelligent comedy.  Among the most memorable are the ones with Michael Greene (As David's boss), when he informs David that instead of a promotion he's being transferred to New York to work on their latest acquisition, Ford (`We got trucks, too.'); one with Garry Marshall (As a casino manager in Las Vegas); and finally, the scene in which David explains the concept of the `nest egg' to Linda, which has to be, historically, one of the classic comedy scenes of all time.  The solid supporting cast includes Tom Tarpey (Brad Tooey, the `bald-headed man from New York'), Ernie Brown, Art Frankel, Charles Boswell and Joey Coleman.  Written by Brooks and Monica Johnson, `Lost In America' is a timeless comedy classic that can be enjoyed over and over again.  I rate this one 10/10.

After watching The Muse, which until this day remains the FUNNIEST comedy I've ever seen, I've been curious about Brooks's work.  Since this had its place on the AFI's funniest comedies of all time, I decided I'd check it out.  Though I didn't feel this was quite as funny as The Muse, Brooks delivers his trademark sarcastic comic gags.  It's hilarious to watch Brooks, a yuppie businessman who just quit his job, try to apply for a job among the lower class.  Asking if there are any executive positions. Brooks has the best timing among all the comic actors.  His style of delivering his brilliantly sarcastic dialogue is impeccable and almost never fails to crack me up!  Brooks's movies are not only funny, but they're well-written.  Lots of the time comedies move on the sheer energy of the cast.  In his films, the writing alone is energized enough and the cast adds to that energy.  Brooks and Julie Hagerty have an incredible chemistry, and their conflicts are absolutely hysterical.  From now on, you will never be allowed to use the words 'nest' or 'egg' ever again!  That's a line I will always remember.  Brooks has that memorable, unique style of writing that I'm sure comedy writers everywhere will either acknowledge thoroughly or try to imitate (unsuccessfully, of course).  One thing I just cannot understand is the R-rating.  Brooks, being one of the few tasteful, intelligent comedy writers in the biz, rarely uses profanity in his movies.  Only twice do we hear the f word, and for the right reasons (He was angry at his boss for God's sake!).  I'm well-aware that the PG-13 rating wasn't invented when the movie came out, but Sixteen Candles used the f word twice and got away with a PG, as well as a shower scene involving a female and a notorious close-up of her breasts.  Don't expect anything filthy in this movie, because of the stupidly-awarded R-rating.  Brooks doesn't sink that low.For all those who appreciate good, intelligent humor--an escape from cheap slapstick and gross-out gags.  Not that I don't appreciate that type of humor ever, but this is REALLY what comedy is all about!My score  7 (out of 10)     "},{"Title":"Hilarious satire from masterful Albert Brooks","Date":"17 June 1999","Score":"11 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  Albert Brooks and Monica Johnson have fashioned in their Lost in America screenplay a spot-on portrait of upper middle class malaise and its correspondent affluence atrophy -- and skewered it all with perfect vignettes of accomplished comic finesse.

Brooks, who not only co-wrote the film but also stars and directs, only falters a bit when it comes to the overall pacing (I thought the section that opens the film spends too much time in Los Angeles before the couple decides to head out for the open road), but this is a minor complaint.

It's probably his best film, the most successful in terms of sustained humor. Others, like 'Defending Your Life' and 'The Muse' fall flat for long stretches and Brooks' neurotic persona starts to grate. But when he's good, he's very good, and there are some gaspingly hilarious moments in 'Lost in America.' I wouldn't mind being Albert Brooks. Without ever having a huge commercial success, he has been able to produce films regularly (while appearing in others) for the last thirty years. He's sort of a poor man's Woody Allen, but frankly I prefer Brooks and find his comic style much more palatable. 'Lost in America' finds David Howard (Brooks) expecting a big promotion at the ad agency where he works. More than expecting it, he is banking on it. He and his wife Linda (Julie Hagerty) have sold their house and bought a new one, so certain are they of this impending move up and increase in salary. David's friends and co-workers have all told him he's a shoo-in for the job. Yet worry nags at him. He's like a little kid who has convinced himself he's going to get a pony for Christmas but deep down knows there's no way. The big day arrives and when the dust has settled, David's worst fears have come true. In fact, worse than his worst fears, because before that dust settles, more has happened than he could have conceived that morning while he was rehearsing his 'acceptance speech.' This is the funniest scene in the film, a classic little study of human nature when everything that can possibly go wrong does. It's not slapstick; it's just a three-way conversation between David, his boss, and a bald man from New York. Before his boss even has a chance to really say anything, David launches into his thank you's and what a great day it is and how he is going to practically live at the agency from now on, giving the new job his all. That's great, his boss says, except you're not being promoted, you're going to New York to work on a new account (Ford) as Brad's (the bald man) assistant. Nothing in David's repertoire of responses is adequate to reply to this; part of his overcoming the nagging worry was to totally dismiss the possibility of this happening. So he loses it, completely. He rips into his boss, into Brad, into Brad's impromptu idea for a jingle (this little Town Car, will drive you away to the tune of 'New York, New York'), into his wasted years at the agency, into his boss's hairpiece, into New York itself (if you think it's so great, why don't YOU go to New York? he shouts). By the end of all this, which has taken less than fifteen minutes, he not only doesn't have the promotion, he's been fired. All of which is just the set-up for the rest of the film. A super-hyped-up David dashes to Linda's office and breathlessly tells her what happened, desperately trying to put the best spin on things. He decides on the spur of the moment that they should sell everything they own and drop out of society, like they did in 'Easy Rider.' One of the ideas he spews out has to do with uninhibited sex (I think) and concludes with the inspired thought that there are some people you f*** in front of and some people you don't. We'll FIND THE ONES... and then we'll spend the rest of our lives f****** in front of them! Linda tries to calm him down before he hyperventilates but soon he is rushing off to price motorhomes. From there, they head off across America in a Winnebago, to touch Indians among other things, but the trek turns out to be an abbreviated one as they only make it as far as Arizona, after Linda gambles away all their money in Las Vegas. There are other funny moments which inevitably seem a bit anti-climactic after the high-intensity rush of laughter induced by the above-mentioned two scenes. Still, it is a well-paced comedy that finds Brooks at a peak, consistently coming up with funny lines and situations. Many of the ideas hit very close to home with young urban professionals, if they are self-observant enough to notice. Not too many films are really 'laugh out loud' funny, but 'Lost in America' is one of them.

Casey said he'd already seen it five or six times and now I know why. Director, writer and star Albert Brooks has created the perfect yuppie comedy. An advertising executive in his thirties who is on the verge of buying a new house for he and his wife, which he's hoping to coincide with his long-awaited promotion to vice president, is called into his bosses office and learns that not only isn't he getting the promotion, all he's getting is a lateral transfer (from their LA office to their New York offices). In probably the finest job- quitting scene in the history of film, Brooks explodes in the most acerbic, articulate way everybody has always dreamed of when realizing all their years of hard work mean nothing.He leaves his job, talks his wife (Julie Haggerty) into quitting hers, and they decide to find themselves on the open road just like Easy Rider. They sell EVERYTHING, buy a Winnebago and STILL have about 150,000 dollars to their name and head to Vegas. Brooks qualifies himself every time he has to deal with someone Hi, uh, my wife and I have dropped out of society, and... They have enough money, he conservatively estimates, to stay on the road for the rest of their lives. That's before she loses their nest egg at the roulette table. Brooks the adman tries to talk the casino owner (Garry Marshall) into giving back the money. It doesn't work, but Brooks keeps pushing, trying to sell the casino on improving its image. (I'm a high-paid advertising consultant. These are professional opinions you're getting.) There are other great scenes, as the desperate couple tries to find work to support themselves An interview with an unemployment counselor, who listens, baffled, to Brooks explaining why he left a $100,000-a-year job because he couldn't find himself. And Brooks' wife introducing her new boss, a teenage boy.The funniest aspect of the film, though, is the element of materialistic panic Brooks is able to squeeze out of his character. He's a typical A-type, potential heart-attack victim he makes a lot of money (80K! ), but not enough; who lives in a big house, but is outgrowing it; who drives an expensive car, but not a Mercedes-Benz; who is a top executive, but not a vice president. In short, he is a desperate man, trapped by his own expectations.See this with your friend from Microsoft who got hired fresh out of high school.

His deadpan routine is really what made him famous, and this was really an introduction to his work for me. I was underwhelmed but not really disappointed.David Howard (Brooks) is an advertising guy who is expecting a promotion, but when he doesn't get it, he decided to take his wife Linda (Julie Hagerty) to start a new life, Easy Rider style. She quits her job and they go out roaming the country in their new Winnebago. However, when they get to Vegas, David finds out something about Linda that will change their entire journey.Put simply, Lost in America is not a funny movie. It is comedic, sure, but it never made me laugh once. Their situations were grounded in reality, and what Brooks (who also directed and co-wrote) was going for was to show what could actually happen in real life. Therefore, there was nothing in the least wacky going on. I think Brooks was having trouble keeping a lot of funny things for reality; much of what was somewhat funny was whatever was improvised and started to grow a little over-the-top.On the other hand, where at one point Lost in America failed with it having be in a basis of reality, it was good that it seemed real, that it could happen to anyone. Everyone has a little David Howard in them, and when he was basically telling his boss to `take his job and shove it', everyone who has ever worked in corporate America, much like Office Space, would be standing up and cheering.In addition, Lost in America was constantly entertaining. There were no dull moments, and at a quick 91 minutes, it's a cheerful diversion.

We start with what is clearly an unhappy couple having a tense discussion about how their life will play out in the next few days. David will get a promotion, the two of them will move to a new house, and everything will be fine. It is when David does not get the promotion he expects that everything changes, and the couple has to learn to live spontaneously.Wait though, because this can't just happen &#x96; the characters have to learn/make mistakes in order to change their outlook on life. David is still very methodical, planning to use a specific amount of money for one thing and carefully spend the rest on luxuries after the two are remarried. Unfortunately, the film resides to making a dumb character out of his wife Linda, who loses all of their money (except $820) on an entire night of playing roulette. Because God forbid we have a thoughtful female for the protagonist's wife in this film about finding the self.To me, the pacing of this film seems a little off &#x96; it is quick and funny at some parts, but these parts are cut between some scenes that are overly long with few cuts and tons of dialogue to preach the message of the film to the viewer, the message being when times are tough it is important not to lose the sense of self.The second half of the film is not as predictable as the first half, particularly the delightful turn at the conclusion of the film. With the tone of the film set, I knew this film would have a happy ending, but what I was expecting did not involve David getting his previous job back, because it kind of goes against the themes presented in the middle of the film. I enjoyed the nice surprise though, and things were clear to me when David asked if he should eat s*** in New York &#x96; it made the scene where he examines a dream car passing by a lot more relevant than I had taken that scene to be. While most of the film force feeds the importance of living life by your own terms (especially with too many references to Easy Rider) David getting his executive job back at the end shows that, as I have read somewhere before, financial stability can equal emotional stability at times.

It starts out with Howard (Brooks) established as a moderately successful advertising executive, who with his managerial wife, plan to put a down payment on a 400k house. But the corporate lifestyle has sapped some of the excitement out of both their lives, and before divorce proceedings set in, they hilariously quit their jobs and set out on the open road to find themselves. And along the way they bring the 'nest egg'. Unfortunately, things don't go as planned, and the soul searching quickly becomes a trip through hell. With each quagmire the couple finds themselves in, Brooks' character hilariously pleads with the people he sees as obstacles to their luck. The film is built around 3 or 4 of these lengthy, seemingly improvised sketch scenes, and is what provides most of the entertainment apart from the scenario. But after the main twist and conflict happens, the film loses steam and the hijinx quickly dissipitate until the film deflates at the end. Little soul searching actually occurs, and the film has a realistic, but disappointing ending after much of the build up to their quagmire. The ending just isn't what was promised after the dark hilarity of misfortune that preceded it. The characters feel annoyingly self entitled at first, and start to grate, but the writing and short running times keeps things feeling fresh long enough to want to finish. Worth watching just for Brooks.

Brooks could be Woody Allen's irritable cousin in terms of his neurotic behavior and impatience.

Your typical Albert Brooks offering, which of course, is not for all tastes. Some can take to his light style of humor like addicts to coke, while others will scream how mediocre this film is to be held up as an example at screen-writing classes.Most of Brooks' humor in his films come from his characters being utterly flummoxed by life or his grinny observations about everyday people. You get that usual array here, but unlike some of his other efforts, this Brooks screenplay seemed oddly malnourished. He gets caught up in this whole Easy Rider nonsense and places the film's more humorous and intriguing moments at the front. The business with Hagerty and the casino happens so quickly, that it a) uses the best device too fast, and b) seems too out of character for her. Brooks needed more time spent on the road meeting goofy locals and emptying his RV's chemical toilet that would eventually prompt Hagerty to do what she does early. And therein lies the film's bigger problem they only really have one predicament. Once they hit their financial nadir, they look for jobs, work them for one day, and the film ends with a cop-out minutes later.Sorry to forward-project, but I was a GREAT admirer of Brooks' Defending Your Life. It had his usual breezy, near lulling atmosphere on display, but with the life-after-death exploration as a great backdrop, that filmed worked better.

Easily the best comedy of the bloated 1980s, possibly of the last thirty years. It ranks among the works of Preston Sturges in terms of sheer comic invention.Albert Brooks and Julie Hagerty are a Los Angeles yuppie couple who are happily married but feel stuck in the go-go 1980s decade of shallow materialism. When Brooks doesn't get the promotion he feels he deserves he spontaneously quits and convinces his wife to do the same. they liquidate their assets, buy a mobile home and ride off just like Easy Rider into America, to find themselves and touch Indians.One thing about Brooks' comedy style it is brutally, brutally cynical. You just know their jaunt into the heartland of America isn't going to end well. And yet, Brooks' sincerity about his character making a statement about selling everything and going off in search of America is clearly genuine. That what makes this film so remarkable. This is a portrait of an artist in wild conflict with himself. When Brooks sees the Mercedes at the end and the film shifts to soft-focus lighting and we hear a choir singing - that has to be one of the funniest, yet most cynical moments in any comedy ever made.I would highly recommend this film to anyone. However, not everyone gets Brooks' style of comedy. Some people seem to find him annoying.

As Albert Brooks's character, David Howard, consistenly asks, Have you ever seen Easy Rider? Basically, he and his wife just pick up and head off to get away from it all and they think they've got their roughing it epiphany all planned out. And boy, were they wrong.Despite Albert Brooks's typically annoying character (David) who just loves to berate a point to death, both he and Haggerty were good in this little adventure/mishap. Brooks is David Howard, an advertising executive. His wife, Linda (Haggerty) is a personnel manager. They just sold their house and David is expecting a promotion. At first, Linda is the only one with doubts about the way things going, particularly the lack of spontaneity and the scary realization that everything with her and David, their jobs, and so forth, will be stagnat and pretty boring from that point forward. It takes David awhile to figure out that he's stuck in a rut as well after being passed up for a vice president promotion while some younger guy with less seniority gets the job. David, as usual, tries to plead with the person who seems to be his present obstacle to his goal, but to no avail. In fact, he makes a total fool out of himself, and suddenly finds himself out of a job. WARNING SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT.But the failed meeting actually energizes David into doing some thinking, basically having the same realizations (although impulsively so) that his wife does. The plan just quit the jobs, save the house, and hit the road in their Winnebego with the protection of their nearly two-thousand dollar nest egg to carry them along for the next few years, protecting the nomads. The first mistake relying on this plan.As the movie tells you at the end, anyone with a plan like this should completely avoid Nevada at all costs. While stopping there to renew their vows, David and Linda stop at the 'Desert Inn,' where Linda gambles away nearly every bit of the nest egg, at least an amount that meant something. And now, the couple's relationship becomes like a father yelling at his teenage child for totally wrecking valuable items. And with only their Winnebego, a short supply of gas and food, and hot tempers left to guide them, they really will get to experience roughing it...Hollywood style anyway.I don't particularly like the ending. I suspect with convictions this strict, they might not have been expected to stick it out in the boonies trailer park in some teeny tiny Arizona squat, but they could've gone elsewhere and roughed it. Then again, that's almost as unrealistic as the ending they used in the movie loading up the camper and heading back to homebase. Though, with a near total loss of a pretty valuable nest egg (they were gambling the whole thing from the start--putting nothing off to the side), the only thing to do was turn around and go back to everything they knew and, like a Hollywood ending, get equal to or better than what they had when the left, even though David for the most part left on bad terms with his boss, letting the expletives fly and the veins poke out. Isn't there a movie where the family says yes, lets get away from all of this bullsh*t, and actually go through with it to the end? The real self-finding experience and all of that. Not something that suddenly turns into the characters rethinking how much they wanted to get away from it, deciding that yeah, so this kind of lifestyle is sucking the life from us, but we're just too used to it to leave. Then again, is there ever a middle ground? Like, if David and Linda went back, but couldn't get that $100,000/year job back or she couldn't get such an exciting jobs. Double dang! No less, aside from that, you might enjoy this one.

Albert Brooks' performance is brilliant as is his script and direction. This movie captures much more than the escapades of two yuppies seeking an enhanced existence.

We begin with an unhappy yuppie speaking in hypothetics, searching for a way to change his life.  The plans that he based the rest of his yuppie-hood are quickly sullied, and this springboards him into a new way of life (which is justified by the success of fictional characters in his favorite movie).  He takes his suppressed wife along with him, and just like that, without anyone really noticing, Lost In America is off to the races.Since every one of Albert Brooks' films are damn near perfect(with the exception of his 1999 clunker, The Muse), it is silly to call this his best film.  But it certainly is his most focused.  The subplots are a little more than quick, sketch-like detours, leaving the central story of what actually happens when responsible people drop out to fill the screen for all ninety-one minutes of neurotic bliss.The smartest thing Brooks could have done was to make it appear as if this was a movie about two people with a lot of money and a Winnebago travelling across country, encountering hijinks along the way.  In fact, this movie is about reality.  This movie's about two people who liquidate their assets, buy a Winnie, set out for the rest of their lives, and then LOSE EVERYTHING.  The comedy of Lost In America is imbedded in the what now? expression that the star and director carries in his eyebrows.  What could be angled for heavy dramatic purposes is turned into situational comedy (the main character's wife leaving him, going off with an ex-convict, who then beats up the main character is FUNNY?) beautifully by the writers (Brooks and frequent co-conspirator Monica Johnson).  Albert Brooks is NOT a West Coast Woody Allen.

That's because the pace is very low and the jokes tend to be very cerebral and subtle. Most teens and action movie fans would probably get bored very quickly seeing this film--especially since the best moments occur later in the film.The film is a strange look at yuppies who are sick of the suburban life and want to see America. Actually, Albert Brooks wants to drop out and see America--his wife, Julie Haggerty, is less thrilled with the change and is content just to remain in their old lives. But, she loves her hubby and ultimately agrees to sell everything and buy an RV and head out on the open highway.However, their wonderful plans all come crashing down around them when they get to Las Vegas. Brooks goes to sleep and the next morning he finds his wife in the casino--where she had been all night long and where she had just gambled away all their possessions! This is only about halfway through the film--what happens and how they survive is something you'll have to find out yourself.

There's a great deal of potential for humor in Brooks and Hagerty's situation, but a lot of it gets lost in its underlying bleakness.Worse, structurally this film is a MESS (and to explain this involves revealing the ending, so be warned). Brooks and Hagerty have lost practically EVERYTHING, and both are reduced from working at high-paying, prestigious corporate jobs to, respectively, working as a crossing guard and an assistant manager at Weinerschnitzel in a dead-end town in Arizona. This dreary situation the main characters have gotten themselves into resolves itself in, literally, the LAST THREE MINUTES OF THE MOVIE (if that long). Brooks says, basically, screw this; I'll go to New York and get my old job back - and so, in a hasty montage, we see the two of them traverse the entire country to New York City, and it is revealed in scrolling text right before the end credits that Brooks did indeed get his job back and everything is now hunky-dory. I'm not sure exactly what the point of the rest of the movie is when it's all tied up so neatly and abruptly. The entire movie is spent laboriously drawing the two in deeper and deeper, only to put them practically back where they started via two or three minutes' worth of explanation that should have taken fifteen or twenty.So what IS the ending trying to say? That it's a losing game to throw it all away, to live your dream - that your only hope is to reenter a life of drudgery? Pretty bleak message for a comedy. I give this one a 5.

Not worth the rental fee or the wait time in your cue if you do the mail thing. I can't believe that Bravo put this on their funniest all time comedy list.

The plot becomes very predictable. And an extremely long pointer scene, leads you right to the conclusion that the Vegas visit is going to be a bad move. The film is excruciatingly slow moving, it takes over 1/3 of the film to eventually get the couple in their Winnebago and on the road. The pace increases briefly when Albert Brooks is running through the hotel then grinds back to its dirge.Brooks is his usual character. I really wouldn't call it acting as its the same character I've seen in any other film he's been in, Defending Your Life, The Muse, Broadcast News, etc... So if you're a fan of his character than you'll possibly enjoy this movie. Maybe the script is a funny read that just didn't translate to celluloid. Instead of laughs I found frustration. The lame and predictable situations, the whining, seemingly endless boredom, well its 90 minutes of your life you'll never get back.The only upside to this film is the scenery of America. From LA to New York, you get to see what America looks like on I-10. So if you're into American Scenery Skip to the last 5 minutes of the movie to see the best part, and avoid all of the frustrations of watching it all the way through.

Trouble is, it had an hour and a half, and did about five minutes of development.Al Brooks and his character were annoying -- just flat-out cliché. Julie Hagerty's character was at least interesting and provided the only sympathy I felt toward anything in the movie. But even her character was messed up by the haphazard development, which pushed the character in various inconsistent directions.I'm glad I watched it because I've been reading about it for almost 20 years thinking I should see it.
