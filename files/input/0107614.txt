Second, Robin Williams and Sally Field as well as the three children act very delightfully though the movie deals with a rather serious theme---warmth and importance of family. Some people say Sally Field doesn't act well in this movie. But, I think that she acts a role of a wife whom is worried about her husband excelentlly. We feel big love of both father and mother toward children. It is not only a real funny comedy but also a real wonderful family movie. "},{"Title":"Robin Williams Dressed Up As A 60 Year Old Women?

DOUBTFIRE (1993) ***1/2Starring Robin Williams, Sally Field, Mara Wilson, and Pierce BrosnanDirected by Chris Columbus. Written by Leslie Dixon and Randi Mayem Singer. Running time 125 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for sexual references and some language) By Blake French	Mrs. Doubtfire is one of the most invigorating, vivid character studies to be produced on the big screen this decade. Most of the characters are strongly executed with decisive dialogue. They are also beautifully written with tainted personalities and uncompromising wit. Chris Columbus has assembled a stellar dramatic comedy with excellent screen writing, giving audiences one of the most punctually artful films I have ever witnessed.	The opening scene is as brilliantly structured as screen writing otherwise comes. It has a middle-aged man named Daniel, whom we learn about as he quits his job as a vocal performer for a children's cartoon after he realizes his employers are immoral. This sequence provides us with a development of the character's inner personality, strong morals and consciences. The audience also leans that he is a silly, easy going person. We soon find out it is these characteristics that propel the movie into the first plot point.	Daniel's wife, Miranda, wishes to divorce him because he is too goofy and immature. We are propelled quickly into the firm second act after the divorce. Before this point, we have witnessed both actions and dialogue reallocating Daniel's love and compassion for his family, especially his children. The film sets up the for following events using Robin Williams character as the plot advancer.	Daniel lusts for time with his children so much, he confidentially disguises himself as a sixty year old woman then applies for a day-care job for his ex-wife--this would allow him to be around his children more often. Miranda falls for it, and the master of disguise gets his opportunity. The film then takes us through a hilarious and emotional journey into the lives of a typical American divorced family.	The internal problem becomes more complex when Daniel's ex wife shows romantic interest in a new boyfriend, underplayed by Pierce Brosnan. The filmmakers could have done more with the Brosnan character. Here, he seems developed with repetition and dialogue. Although his purpose is to accommodate romantic competition, we don't know enough about him to care that much.	Mrs. Doubtfire contains some material that fairs as overly blunt and outwardly apprehensive. Although the overall presentation is understandable and relative, I still think the picture could have been better with more careful script writing. Even such, we are able to witness a powerful, touching film with a conclusion that is so settling, you will cry with joy.Brought to you by 20th Century Fox.

Not normally a huge fan of comedy, I was just about rolling in the theatre aisles during this gem. Robin Williams is brilliant in his 'dual role' as the rejected husband, Daniel, and the buxom British nanny, Mrs. Doubtfire.This movie tells the story of a bitter separation, when Miranda insists on a divorce from her immature, goofy husband. Daniel, denied custody and given only limited visitation, concocts a female nanny character for himself in order to gain daily access to his three children. The kids grow to love and depend on their unusual but very concerned and efficient new nanny, Mrs. Doubtfire, who really gets the household running extremely smoothly. Of course meanwhile Miranda has a new love interest named Stu.Williams' portrayal of Mrs. Doubtfire is hilarious in every way, shape, and form. The wig, stockings, dress, make up...it's all too amusing, watching Daniel transform for the part. Wait till you see Mrs. Doubtfire cooking! The most insanely funny scene is at a restaurant where Daniel / Mrs. Doubtfire must quickly be in two places at the same time, so he / she is forced to alternate between personae at lightning speed, sometimes forgetting which one he / she is at any given moment. I won't give away the plot, but I nigh expired from laughing.Sally Field charmingly plays Daniel's now separated wife, Miranda, and Pierce Brosnan is suitably unsympathetic as her new love interest, Stu. We cheer for Daniel through his assorted antics as he tries to shoo away this romantic competitor for his ex wife's affections and especially, this new male threatening to usurp his role as father to his kids.Desite being a comedy, this film does on the serious side reveal the devastating effects of divorce on children's lives and also particularly on the noncustodial parent. Daniel is distraught as he misses seeing his kids every day. Furthermore, the entrance of a new love interest naturally adds to the general strife.Where did Mrs. Doubtfire get her unusual name? Does she live on or fizzle out at movie's end? Will Daniel and Miranda get back together, or will Stu prevail? I won't divulge any spoilers, but I guarantee you'll fall in love with this lovable large nanny and wish you could have her babysit your own kids. Mrs. Doubtfire will certainly live on in your heart.

It really hits the spot with tremendous performances by ALL cast members. The score by composer Howard Shore gives a real warm feel to the whole duration of the movie. With the DVD release, you get to see all the deleted scenes. In particular is a scene where Lydia (Lisa Jakub) is distracted during her turn in the spelling bee by her mother and father (Sally Field, Robin Williams) who are arguing quietly because Daniel (Williams) arrived late, and could not sit with the family. The scene concludes with Lydia talking with her father about being a real family again. Lydia tells Daniel It's your job to be our father. Daniel replies with No, it's a joy being your father. Scenes like these give Mrs. Doubtfire a real sense of reality when it comes to families that are separated by differences between the parents. It tells children that it's okay if your parents don't get along, and are separated. It's not your fault. Don't blame yourself. There are all sorts of different families out there.What really gives this movie it's unique touch is the brilliant performances of EVERYONE in this film. I definitely recommend this film to anyone who loves a good family film. My suggestion, get the DVD release. It has a lot of extra features you won't get on the VHS.

I really like Robin Williams, an actor that is I personally don't care for him that much as a comedian, and the roles of Daniel Hillard and Mrs Doubtfire were perfect for him. While he was fine as Daniel, it is his tour-de-force performance of Mrs Doubtfire that drives the film. Plus the make up used on him was fantastic. Also worthy of credit is director Chris Columbus, who nails the use of Williams's exuberance and quick-fire personality, and because of this every gag hits the right buttons. There are cracking set pieces such as the make up experiments and the series of table hopping quick changes. And I for one liked the routine with the dinosaur, it wasn't one of the better gags but it was funny. Pierce Brosnan also does surprisingly well as the bachelor looking for a ready-made family, and Mara Wilson gives one of her better performances as Natalie, very delightful and charming her performance was. The script is also funny and touching, the score is warm and sweet and the film is very nice to look at. Some people didn't like the ending, but I had no real problem with it personally. My only complaints are that the film is a little too long and Sally Field overdoes the exasperation slightly as the mother, but overall this is a delightful film, no matter how many times you see it, you are likely to love it every time, whether it is Williams, the gags or Wilson. 9/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"perfect movie!!","Date":"15 November 2006","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" This is one of the best movies of Fall-Dawn funny, comical, and impressive.Daniel Hirard, played by Robin Willams, who is losing his job are declared divorce by his wife.

Yet Daniel does not earnestly strive to force them to do better for themselves until he suits up as Mrs. Doubtfire. Clearly he is capable of being a positive influence, and in some way he must have been even before, since his children seem to love him so much--so what gives? Miranda's behavior toward her husband mirrors that of a woman on tranquilizers, yet she somehow holds a successful career and truly cares for their three children. Was she cheating on her husband? The swiftness with which she warms to the advances of her wily English client suggest so, but the plot and the dialogue--especially her confession to Mrs. Doubtfire--ask us to believe otherwise.Daniel's irresponsibility does not seem to breach that line of shirking his duties to his family. Or perhaps, unconsciously, this movie is a commentary on the refusal of modern fathers to act like men and the unworkability of two-breadwinner houses. Maybe they would have been much better off if he had remained a homemaker. But Miranda wanted it all a solid, independent, successful career, a beautiful family, AND a powerful, manly husband who could protect and watch over her.But it doesn't really matter, because this movie does not concern itself with the dynamics of their EXTREMELY PETTY divorce. Nor does the conclusion, in spite of its pretensions to the contrary, nourish a belief in forgiveness and redemption. Nobody in this movie behaves honorably--and granted, nobody in real life ever completely does, but it is really sad to think that life necessarily becomes so miserable just because of a few petty flaws.

Now, bear with me, folks, because I make these observations not only as an avid movie-lover, but as someone who's survived a divorce and been through a lot of Hell after.Firstly, the very presence of Sally Field, who plays The Perpetual Victim, annoys me. She's been in pretty much every over-hyped drama ever made, whether it was 'Not Without My Daughter', or just the newest movie-of-the-week on Lifetime. She just never got over the network canning The Flying Nun, and has been weeping on screen ever since.Secondly, Robin Williams' character resorting to the deception of cross-dressing and acting out the role of an old woman just to be with his children. In any kind of an amenable divorce, a compromise short of that extreme should be made available, either by cooperation between the parents or suggestions from a third party. Perhaps a counselor of some kind.Thirdly, as a man who's been through a divorce and sees nothing of his own daughter thanks to her mother, I really resent the implication the movie makes, that the only suitable father figure for children is a woman. Men have our roles in society and life, too, and as more than just comic relief. But like so many other movies, in this one Dad's the goofball screw-up who causes all kinds of chaos, and only Mom can fix everything with just a few well-barked orders and two phone calls. Give me a break. Women are just as flawed and human as men, but the way the movies keeps presenting the gender roles is just wildly unfair.In short, I've seen better, and I wouldn't rush to see this again.

A serious message, pertinent to marriage and children, frames and supports the comedic plot, which gives the film depth and substance.The entire production hangs on the talents of Robin Williams versatile, energetic, improvisational, and hugely entertaining. It's the kind of talent that seems natural, not studied or forced. The rest of the cast orbits Williams, but does so effectively. There's not a weak casting link in the bunch. And makeup artists must have had a field day with Mrs. Doubtfire, who, though rather imposing for a female, comes across quite believable, again given that the film is a comedy.My only serious complaint is the cinematography. That widescreen projection is too severe. I would have preferred more of a full screen projection.Mrs. Doubtfire will not be everyone's cup of tea. You have to give the film wide latitude.

Just before watching it, I knew it starred talented comedian/actor Robin Williams, whom I was a big fan of, and knew it was about his character disguised as a woman, which certainly sounded promising for a comedy. My first viewing of Mrs. Doubtfire was definitely not one to forget, and I got more than just laughs out of it. After that, my second viewing three years later didn't disappoint me at all. My opinion on Williams as a performer hasn't changed since 2007, and watching this movie again turned out to be a lot like the first time.Daniel Hillard is a voice-over actor who quits his job after an argument with his boss. He is also the loving but irresponsible father of Lydia, Chris, and Natalie. Just after quitting his job, he throws a chaotic, disruptive, out-of-control birthday party for Chris. After his wife, Miranda finds out about this, she is fed up and decides it's time for a divorce after fourteen years of marriage. Daniel goes to live in an apartment, and gets to see his kids once a week, every Saturday evening, but this is not often enough for him. When he learns that Miranda is looking for someone to hire as a housekeeper, he decides to take advantage of his voice and acting skills, and creates himself a new alter ego, a sixty year old woman named Mrs. Iphegenia Doubtfire. In his disguise, he applies for the housekeeping job and gets it, so he now gets to see his offspring every day again. This goes well, and being Mrs. Doubtfire turns out to be an educational experience for him, but how long will he be able to hide the fact that Mrs. Doubtfire is actually Daniel Hillard? With the opening sequence, showing Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) in the studio recording his voice-overs and then getting into an argument with his boss and quitting, the movie is off to a good and comical start. It stays fairly consistent throughout, with many memorably funny scenes, such as the birthday party, Daniel doing numerous voice impressions in front of social worker Mrs. Sellner, the divorced father having to change back and forth from Mrs. Doubtfire to himself while Mrs. Sellner is in his apartment, Stu Dunmeyer (Miranda's new love interest) calling Daniel a loser in front of Mrs. Doubtfire (not realizing it's him) and getting fruit thrown at him, and many other things that happen on the main character's little adventure, as well as some funny lines coming from his alter ego. Most of the drama in this film was also well done, with decent dialogue, and there certainly are some poignant scenes. Both the humour and the serious parts help keep it interesting. Williams shows not only his comedic talent here, but also his acting abilities. Most of the other cast performances are decent enough here. There was something I didn't like about the two older Hillard kids, Lydia and Chris (not sure how to describe it), but they certainly could have had worse family characters in this movie.This was directed by Chris Columbus, and I haven't seen every film he has ever directed, but have seen Home Alone 1 & 2 (written by John Hughes), Stepmom, and the first two Harry Potter movies. I haven't seen those Harry Potter flicks in years and don't know how they compare, but I would definitely say that Mrs. Doubtfire is superior to the other three films I've seen from Columbus. Of course, these movies all had different writers, so it wasn't entirely Columbus who made them what they are, but it's interesting to compare this film with Stepmom. Both films involve family trouble, and are apparently supposed to be a mix of comedy and drama, but the 1998 release fails in both genres, with a fairly poor script and generally unlikable characters, and I really don't think either of those can describe this 1993 dramedy! This one may have its flaws, but there's still so much to make it satisfying, even at just over two hours long.

Kind of a silly premise that works, again thanks to Williams performance and a very able supporting cast. San Francisco locations help as does a nice music score. Synopsis can be supplied by anyone reading most of these reviews. Despite some plot holes and improbabilities, this movie works on just about all levels. It's kind of a 'dreamy' as opposed to an all out in out comedy. Divorce and unhappy people are never a comic narrative, and the bittersweet ending works just fine. For those of you who are Polly Holliday fans (Flo in the TV sitcom ALICE) she has nothing to do here. She has fourth billing on a card by herself but only has one line of dialogue in one scene. In looking at the cutting room floor clips, she had a much larger part. Here scenes were kind of a sub-plot that was very funny, but entirely eliminated from the final edit.

Having wanting to see his kids, he disguises as the family's new housemaid, and hilarity ensues when he reveals himself to the kids and tries to work with discussing a business meeting and his former wife's birthday at the same place and same time.This movie was quite the crack-upper. It was funny, sweet, and charming. How could I forget the dramatic moments? Daniel and Miranda never get back together, but Daniel gets to visit the kids whenever he wants because of a negotiation with a court judge. Meanwhile as his Mrs. Doubtfire persona, she hosts a television show that's basically the female version of Mr. Rogers, and answers a letter from a kid that's going through the same emotional problems as Daniel's kids. It was a really good movie, and I highly recommend it.

It's an addicting gem of a comedy that's not to be forgotten when looking back on the late Robin William's filmography. One of his most well known characters of all time and one of the biggest family fun comedies of the 90's.Daniel Hillard, (Robin Williams) copes with his divorce from his wife, (Sally Field) by disguising himself as a nanny who works for her so he can be near his kids. He not only betters himself, but learns to be a more responsible parent that he lacked when he was married.I love this film, plain and simple. Robin Williams brings out all his comedic talent in almost every scene, including voice acting, mugging, shockingly insulting, etc. His makeup job is fantastic, and he is the perfect person for it.My nostalgia out of the way, it's a clever comedy that builds on the awkwardness of each scene to which he meets his wife's new partner, almost getting caught, not being cut out as a nanny at the beginning, etc. The music by Howard Shore is simple but pleasant. The film never really drags, it's long, but appropriately. The film doesn't really go too in depth, it just simply lets Robin Williams be a goof everywhere he goes, which is what we came to see.It's a pleasant film overall. I will love it until death departs it from me, and Robin Williams will forever be remembered for it.

The talented actor, Robin Williams, acts as Daniel Hillard who works doing voices, and who quits his job. On that day, Daniel had a party for his son which made his wife, Miranda Hillard mad. Miranda couldn't handle Daniel anymore, so they got divorced. That set off Daniel to do something, so I found him very clever and a risk-taker. One day, a house keeper, whose name is Mrs. Doubtfire, came to Miranda's house. Their children thought it's better to ask their father to look after them. Miranda thought it was nice to have Mrs. Doubtfire as their house keeper so she decided to hire her. On another day, the son accidentally saw Mrs. Doubtfire in the bathroom. This accident made the elder sister and brother know that Mrs. Doubtfire was actually their father, Daniel! But they kept the secret so that their mother wouldn't know. On Miranda's birthday, they went to a restaurant. On that day, all of the family would know that Mrs. Doubtfire was Daniel. Of course Miranda stopped having Mrs. Doubtfire as a house keeper. The children missed Mrs. Doubtfire. But not only the children, Miranda also thought it was nice when Mrs. Doubtfire was around, The house was so warm and cosy, the beds were always made, and the dinner was.... As Daniel pretended to be the house keeper, Mrs. Doubtfire, s/he was able to discipline himself. That made Miranda change her mind. This movie was very touching and make us think about family. It also includes comedy so it's best to see whenever you want to laugh and be touched. All of you should watch this movie!

It stars Robin Williams, Sally Field, Lisa Jakub, Matthew Lawrence, Mara Wilson, Pierce Brosnan and Harvey Fierstein. Music is by Howard Shore and cinematography by Donald McAlpine.Robin Williams plays Daniel Hillard, a struggling out of work actor who when faced with divorce from Miranda (Field) and separation from his three children, disguises himself as an old female housekeeper in order to see them daily.Centrally as a film it is what it is, a chance for Williams (excellent) to dress up in drag and act the goof, but boy does he do it well. In the mix is the serious aspects involving the pain of imminent divorce and separation from one's children. The script is sharp and ready made for Williams' brand of cynical witticisms, while not painting Brosnan's Stuart Dunmire (the new man in Miranda's life) as an oily snake shows good sense in the writing. The child actors are engaging and never sickly, while Fierstein as Daniel's artistic eccentric brother is gloriously colourful.A real family crowd pleaser that turned a profit of over $400 million at the worldwide box office, it's not a film that pushes boundaries of drag comedy, and you don't have to dig too far for flaws. But this is often very funny and it hits the right emotional beats for the topic at hand. 8/10 "}{"Title":"Still fun","Date":"19 December 2011","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" Mrs. Doubtfire made a huge splash when it was released, but faded quickly. Robin Williams' star, which was shining bright in the late 80's and early 90's (Good Morning Vietnam, Dead Poets Society, The Fisher King, Hook and of course Aladdin) gave the film a huge boost, but he followed it with a string of one disappointment after another (Toys, Nine Months, Jumanji, Jack, Father's Day, Flubber) and by the time he finally made his Oscar winning performance in Good Will Hunting (1997) he was considered an actor well past his prime; worse, he was really getting on people's nerves.None of which helped Mrs. Doubtfire, which aged badly as it is. On the surface, it's just Williams doing one shtick for 90 minutes. The jokes that were daring and almost raunchy in 1993 seem very tame now, and what's worse, the way the film deals with the subject of parents divorcing - which was surprisingly straightforward for a family movie at the time - seems naive today.It's easy to criticize this film - everybody's been doing it constantly over the last two decades. But it's difficult to not enjoy it. Cynicism aside, Mrs. Doubtfire is, undeniably, a very funny and yes, very touching movie. Robin Williams and Sally Field both play characters who are very real and very likable; their relationship feels real too, and they have strong on-screen chemistry. The whole film, in fact, far-fetched and absurd though it may be, hits very close to home, and it's sincerely touching - because the viewer really cares about the characters and their relationship. It demands that you set aside your cynicism and criticism, but it's a lot of fun to watch even now.

This movie is absolutely under-rated here at IMDb.com.I remember watching it back in my teenage days and it was completely hilarious! Now, almost full decade or maybe more, not quite sure, it still captures me entirely. Strange how as a grown-up I focused on different things and noticed something I did not back then, up to a point it could be twisted far from what authors intended, but still, it is a very decent movie you won't easily find in Hollywood production these days.Mrs. Doubtfire (what a witty title I did not captured before, I come from non-English region) teaches about moral as something that looks damaged or lost in the modern days of our world. It teaches about true values that deflated over the course of speed progress and development. It teaches about relationship between a parent and a child in a most sincere and gentle way imaginable. It could be a true story. In fact, it IS a true story.My stomach couldn't be more 'tortured' with laugh last evening. Creators fully revealed their master skills, carefully exploring all the aspects of drama and molded them perfectly into this theatric play.As elusive the film's title can be, this movie is an absolute gem for many, without which film-making magic would not be the same. It gets deep into many levels of human relationships that you can see from a funny and radically new perspective that praise joy and life to it's highest.Robin Williams played one of his lifetime roles, he is among the most talented actors ever encountered, always consistently radiating no matter where appears.

Like Michael Dorsey, the character played by Dustin Hoffman in that film, the hero Daniel Hillard is an out-of-work actor who spends much of the movie pretending to be a woman. Their motives for female impersonation, however, are different. Michael, unable to find work as an actor, thinks that he will have more success if he becomes an actress. Daniel has recently been though a harrowing divorce from his wife Miranda, who has been awarded custody of their three children. Although Daniel loves his children deeply, he only has limited visitation rights, so in order to spend more time with them he uses his acting skills to disguise himself as a 60-year-old British nanny, whom he names Euphegenia Doubtfire. In his new persona he applies for, and obtains, a job as Miranda's housekeeper.(Mrs Doubtfire is referred to in the script as English, but her accent is definitely Scottish. Her surname, in the context of the film, was taken from a newspaper headline reading Police doubt fire was accidental, but it does appear to be a genuine one. The name Euphegenia, probably a portmanteau of Euphemia and Iphigenia, seems to be Daniel's own invention).Tootsie was (among other things) a satire on sexist attitudes in the workplace. Mrs Doubtfire is (among other things) an analysis of gender roles in late twentieth-century society and a critique of American divorce law. Most contested child-custody cases end with custody being given to the mother, largely because of the assumption that women are the caring, nurturing sex and that the father's role is to act as the family breadwinner, a role which, it is assumed, can be performed just as well by an absent father as by a present one. Feminists have been strangely reluctant to criticise this assumption, even though it rests upon woman's place is in the home stereotypes which, in other contexts, they would be the first to denounce as outdated.There is a good deal of satire in the film at the expense of the American court system and the way in which it handles matrimonial cases. The social worker appointed by the Court to report on the child custody issue is a particular figure of fun. In Britain, social workers are often caricatured as right-on politically correct liberals. In America, to judge from the film, it would seem that they are ultra-conservative old ladies who still think that they are living in the 1950s.Mrs Doubtfire also questions some of our basic assumptions about the sexes. Daniel is not very successful in his career, although he clearly has talent as an actor. It is Miranda, a successful businesswoman, who is the family's main breadwinner. Yet it is Daniel who comes across as the more caring and empathetic in his relationship with the children. Although Miranda means well she is too distant and preoccupied with her business to have much time for them. After her divorce much she is forced to delegate much of their care to the supposed Mrs Doubtfire- care which before the divorce would have been undertaken by their father. Daniel's main fault as a father was that he has been too indulgent with his children and has failed to discipline them. Paradoxically, it is only when he adopts a feminine personality that he is able to become a firm father-figure.The obvious temptation would have been to have turned the film into a sentimental comedy of remarriage by making Miranda's new boyfriend Stuart (played by a pre-Bond Pierce Brosnan) an obvious villain and by having Daniel and Miranda living together again by the end of the film, much to the delight of their children. This temptation was, however, resisted, and I think that was the right decision. The film bravely acknowledges that love does not always conquer all and that not all marriages are made in heaven; it ends, however, with a plea to parents to put the interests of their children first, even when their won relationship is breaking down.It would, however, be wrong to analyse this film solely in terms of social issues. It is, first and foremost, a comedy, and a very successful one. Daniel and his alter ego Mrs Doubtfire are both played by Robin Williams, probably the ideal actor for the role because of his talent as a mimic and his ability to do all sorts of comic voices. Largely because of Williams's talents, the film is one of the funniest American movies of the nineties, with some brilliantly conceived and acted scenes, including his voice-overs for the Pudgy the Parrot cartoons, the anarchic birthday party he throws for his son and just about everything he does in his Doubtfire persona. Along with Good Morning, Vietnam, Dead Poets Society and One Hour Photo this is one of Williams's greatest films. It is certainly his funniest performance. 9/10 "},{"Title":"My Favorite Robbin Williams Film.","Date":"2 December 2010","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" Robin Williams gives us his best in this film.

We feel deeply moved as Robin's character in the film is forced to take steps to be united with his children and at the same time look for a new job as well. He balances these tasks with incredible finesse and this should be seen to be believed. The love he feels from is children is warm and heartfelt.

Then we have a court scene at the end..... and well..... all's well that ends well ???Now the ending of the film disappointed me. Is there no compromise and can't a couple rediscover themselves again and restart their married life again? NO! But is is the fashion in an American society - if you don't like your spouse divorce and get another and another and another till either of you DIE OF AIDS (or something like that). Marriage is NOT A JOKE but a pairing of two souls that is sacred (remember the saying till death do we part?). Breaking that bond is an INSULT TO GOD.Even in the most extreme of situations divorce can be prevent by marriage counseling.Those of you that are married for many years can appreciate what I am trying to say. God created the first man, Adam. Then God created Eve from Adam, and he named her Woman as she came from Man. Then he gave her to Adam to be his companion, friend and lover (his wife), and they were the first couple on Earth.MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL.

Daniel wants to stay together and work it out, to be with his kids, but Miranda disagrees. During the divorce, Daniel can only see his children once a week and that is not enough for him.

I feel that Columbus does an excellent job directing the film. The unique story is portrayed as if the audience was right in film living the story. The audience can sense the emotion and closeness of the actors in the film and how great a job each scene is. I believe Columbus was trying to tell viewers that even when parents get divorced the children are always loved so much by both and will do anything to be with them.

The theme of this movie is &#129;gFamily love&#129;h but Daniel's love toward his family makes us laugh especially when Mrs.Doubtfire talks with Stu jealously. I know some people say that they don't like the ending of this movie. But I think this ending can make us imagine this family's future, 1 year later, 10 years later. I hope Daniel and Miranda keep good relationship. I think this movie is full of laugh and love. After watching this movie, you absolutely feel good. I give this movie 10/10.

Some Like It Hot and Tootsie both did the theme as well as its possible to get. Films that were witty, snappy and almost impossible to dislike. And then along comes Mrs Doubtfire. A film that wanted to be Tootsie for the 90s and didn't even come close.Certainly casting Robin Williams was a wise move. His talent for rapid-fire impressions and lightning-quick transformations makes him ideally cast. And the makeup work is pretty impressive. But I think the problem I have with the film is I just couldn't buy his reasons for wanting to disguise himself as a woman.In Some Like It Hot and Tootsie, the men in those films were forced to don drag through desperation, and it made their situations that much more believable. Mrs Doubtfire is aimed squarely at the level of simplistic melodrama. Robin Williams gets divorced from his wife, Sally Field, and poses as a housekeeper so he can keep seeing his kids. That's not desperation. That's insanely contrived plot mechanics. The type of thing that only happens in films. Not real life.I think another problem is director Chris Columbus. Columbus, for all his success as an A-list director, is not a particularly great filmmaker. At best his films are amiable fare, but I have yet to see one film on his resume that is remarkable. Certainly Mrs Doubtfire is nicely made and very polished, but its also overlong, and it doesn't really know what to do with itself. The film would have benefited from some tighter editing. The scene when the kids realise who Mrs Doubtfire really is could have been left out altogether as it has no bearing at all on the rest of the film.Mrs Doubtfire is a rather predictable film too. You can see where Williams' character, Daniel Hillard is going in terms of growth. He starts out as an inattentive husband, and as Mrs Doubtfire he realises his shortcomings and changes his ways. Columbus is known for portraying characters in clear colours of black and white. You hardly ever find a shade of grey in his films. Well, except maybe for one.There is one thing Mrs Doubtfire gets right, and that's Pierce Brosnan's character, Stu. Stu is the new boyfriend going out with Daniel's ex-wife, Miranda. Daniel can't stand him, and has to suffer in silence as he watches this rich and successful man romance his family right out from under his prosthetic nose.It could have been a lot easier for Stu to have played as a one-dimensional villain. Like a smarmy, silver tongued devil who hates the kids making it that much easier for us to sympathise with Daniel. But Brosnan is a good enough actor to invest a real sense of likability and depth into the character, and seems a decent fella who might just be good for the family after all.The downside to this is it makes it that much harder to like Daniel. We're supposed to be sympathetic with Daniel's plight, and having him make snide comments to someone who is really a nice fella just makes him seem petty and selfish. And its an approach that sits at odds with Daniel's supposed emotional growth.Another question to consider is the comedy. Is it all that funny? Well Robin Williams gives another of his energetic performances, and you still can't help but marvel at the way he improvises comic routines out of thin air. But Mrs Doubtfire doesn't quite match up to some of Williams' finest performances in Good Morning Vietnam, or Dead Poets Society. And he overdoes some of the shtick to irritation. Case in point being what should have been the film's ultimate comic set-piece. A scene in a restaurant, where he must be in two places at once as Daniel and Mrs Doubtfire.Like I said earlier, this film is overlong, and that is exactly the problem with this scene. It goes on for far too long, and having him dash back and forth between dinner tables soon gets tedious. What it needed was a more energetic pace to help things zip along. But Columbus is stuck on autopilot.Mrs Doubtfire doesn't quite plumb the depths of Williams' later forays into sentimental schmaltz. At least the ending is partly realistic about divorced couples. But still, if I were Miranda I would have had Daniel carted off to the loony bin after his bizarre antics. Not giving him full visitation rights to their children. Mrs Doubtfire is OK for a chuckle, but if you'll excuse the pun, its not that hard to drag yourself away from it.

Therein lies a problem with casting Robin Williams in the lead role in a film where a man impersonating a woman is a key element. Williams already plays every role in an over-the-top, Im cool and you're not but you wish you were as cool as me manner. Williams's presence detracts from the story rather than adding to it. His insistence on making the characters he plays larger than life totally undermines the credibility of what might have been a cute little story. Williams's inability to portray subtlety is the undoing of this film and turns what might have been an entertaining farce into a monotonous, predictable bore. Sally Field, Pierce Brosnan and Joseph Prosky turn in credible performances in their roles, though there is really nothing extraordinary about any of them. An actor less pre-occupied with his own mark on the character might have made this the entertaining light comedy it was meant to be. This is not a bad movie for younger kids, though, if you don't mind explaining what Mrs. Doubtfire means by cunning linguistics.

The problem Robin Williams is no Dustin Hoffman. Sally Field (Miranda Hilliard) and the children pull off fine, understated performances, as does Robert Prosky as the TV station owner who gives Daniel Hilliard the opportunity to carry his cross-dressing act to children's daytime television. Pierce Brosnan (Stu Dunmeyer) is appropriately charming and stuffy as Miranda's new love interest with whom Daniel wants desperately to compete.The film, though, is all about Robin Williams. Some of the lines come off as improvised in the Williams staccato style of delivery, particularly when Mrs. Doubtfire is grilling Stu about what he expects to receive in return for the expensive birthday gift that he, Stu, purchased for Miranda.The difference between Tootsie and this film is that despite all the makeup, Robin Williams smug self-righteousness and penchant for being too hip for the planet (in his own mind) permeates every scene in which he appears. There is nothing in this film that wasn't done funnier in Tootsie, or even in Some Like It Hot.

Spending most of his career bringing smiles to many faces in America, Williams was an actor who made fans laugh hysterically, and at other times left fans shedding tears. This comedy directed by Chris Columbus stars Robin Williams in one of his most memorable roles, that brings both laughter and a few fears to the eyes of fans everywhere; a comedy sparked with an important message about family. Robin Williams plays Daniel Hillard, an eccentric San Francisco actor who performs voice of cartoon characters on television shows. On his home from a stressful day at work, Daniel picks up his children Lydia (played by Lisa Jakub), Christopher (played by Matthew Lawrence) and his youngest Natalie (played by Mara Wilson). Daniel has very loving relationship with the children, but a marriage with his wife Miranda (played by Sally Field) that is dangling at the edge. Arriving home, Daniel throws a birthday party for Christopher, much to the disagreement with their mother due to his poor grades. When the party ends in disaster, Miranda comes to conclusion that their marriage is not working out and files for divorce. Miranda is granted custody of the children with Daniel only allowed to see them on the weekends which is proved to be hard for both him and the kids as they've grown so close to him. When Miranda calls and seeks out a babysitting service, Daniel with the help of a make-up artist, disguises himself as an elder lady and poses as a babysitter for the children.Robin Williams brings such significant charm to the titular character, and his performance and wittiness may it quite difficult to help but enjoy his portrayal as his character. From the minute he poses as Mrs. Doubtfire, he delivers such pleasant laughter and charm to the film, and thanks to the incredible hair and make-up design, he is truly convincing as the old lady with a man who just wants to spend quality time with his children behind the mask. While this film brings on some great family-friendly laughs along with a few edgier gags, it is also very touching and conveys plenty of themes that contribute to serious discussions about family and relationships. With the main character and his wife's divorce playing a key role in the story, the film sends a strong, heart- filling message about being there for your family when they need you, and this spawns some emotional and occasionally tear-jerking moments. The story tackles on strong issues that many viewers can easily relate to, but at the same time, brings a cherishable chemistry between the characters and laughter that is hard to resist. The characters are nicely written and very likable to where viewers hope for the best in them. Mrs. Doubtfire is a heartwarming movie that you cannot help but love, thanks to the blissful writing, director Chris Columbus's creative mind, and an impressive comedic chemistry by Robin Williams. This movie is strongly recommend to children, teens, and adults alike; it is filled with just about everything Robin Williams is remembered for.

Mrs Doubtfire is a classic, lighthearted fun-filled comedy that will produce laughs for all ages (parental discretion is advised - there are some subtle sexual references and mild coarse language). Daniel Hillard is a recently divorced man, who cannot bear to go a single day without seeing his children. Out of desperation, he disguises himself as a 60 year old British nanny in order to see his children everyday. What follows is cross-dressing, multiple identities mishaps and good old Robin Williams (bless his soul) humour. Mrs Doubtfire will make you laugh and bring you almost to tears at the same time, because underneath all the fun and games there is a powerful message about family and love that transcends separation or divorce. It is also a movie about second chances, about how sometimes people are better for each other when they're apart, and about learning from mistakes. It's a simple plot that is not too complicated to follow and shouldn't be interpreted for more than its face value a simple, light-hearted comedy that tugs just enough at the heart strings. "},{"Title":"The fun of Tootsie with the poignancy of Kramer vs. Kramer... and Robin Williams in his most defining role, laughs-wise and tears-wise...","Date":"15 January 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" Looking at the American Film Institute's list of Top 100 funniest movies, you'll notice that the first one is Some Like it Hot and the second is Tootsie. No need to be a movie expert to know what the two classics have in common. Men dressed as women is probably one of the oldest, and curiously underused, comedic gimmicks, it's an awkward intrusion into the forbidden world, carrying a strange mixture of voyeurism and self-questioning, something capturing both the privilege and the curse of being a woman, which also teaches one lesson or two about being a man. You can make it with laughs, with tenderness, and sometimes with poignant drama.Chris Columbus' 1993 comedy hit, Mrs. Doubtfire belongs to this cross- gender movie traditions, and is rightfully listed at the 67th position in AFI's list. And while it didn't reinvent the wheel on the comedic field, the film bears a strong resemblance with dramas such as Kramer vs. Kramer. It seems obvious since it deals with divorce, but there's more into it Roger Ebert criticized the film for being another showcase of Williams' imitation talent, and while it worked for Aladdin, it failed flat in this film. His mistake, in my opinion, was to misjudge the audience's expectations, it wasn't to see a man dressed in drag, but to see Robin Williams be that man, not because Williams would give another dimension to the film (kids and their parents didn't know he went through divorce) but because Williams was a popular family-appealing actor and his role as Daniel Hillard embodied his personality a man raunchy enough to appeal to dads, tender enough to have this awe-factor with mothers, and any mimics, or voice bits would appeal to the kids. Hillard is probably the closest character to Williams.Indeed, Williams can overplay his eccentric facets like Lemmon in 1959 but he can also break your heart when he mentions his kids, or when he whispers something to his youngest daughter. And as Tootsie dealt with unemployment and gender battle, Mrs. Doubtfire is a movie about divorce that shows to which desperate extremes a father can be pushed to, in order to keep seeing his kids. I don't understand how Ebert could overlook this aspect. That's to say, the film has both the laughs and the heart, and while it would be a stretch to say that all the gags work (on that level, some bits are more predictable than others), Doubtfire is something more than a movie about a disguised Williams. And it's a good reminder of a time where a good old- fashioned comedy could win at the box-office.So, the story is about a family that goes through the harsh experience of divorce, a time where enough is enough and a husband a wife realize they're going through different directions. The set-up is a bit awkward as it leaves us wondering why this successful businesswoman, Miranda, played by Sally Field married this goof-ball voice-actor with the energy and the temper of a teen. When a man celebrates his son's thirteenth birthday by organizing a whole zoo party and dance on a table, you gotta wonder why he didn't expect it would upset his wife, they were really totally different. What follows is a poignant argument where Miranda finally asks for divorce and it doesn't come as a surprise that she gets the custody. I don't even think the kids were surprised. Hillard can only see his children on weekends, which is not enough obviously, he's got three months to prove the judge he's capable to take care of himself, hence the kids, and one way leading to another, he works in a TV station, as a janitor (it seems a bit contrived that all of a sudden, he couldn't find something on the entertainment field) and when he learns that the mother is about to hire a nurse, well, he goes to his makeup expert brother (Harvey Fiernstein) and asks if he can turn him into a woman. I guess the next scene probably upset Ebert as it was another montage of Williams' imitation talent (that and the first interview) but while it was out of place in a movie like Dead Poets Society, it seemed natural that Williams' character would do such things. (If there's one point this review is trying to make by the way is that, once you get that Hillard is Robin Williams' alter-ego, you start watching the movie with different eyes.)So, Hillard becomes Mrs. Doubtfire and if things don't go quite well at start, he quickly impresses Miranda, and he surprisingly turns into a better father model than as he was a man, which echoes the Tootsie situation sometimes, it takes to be like the mother to know the father's job. The movie escalates from comedic situations to another, I have a soft spot for the flirtatious bus driver, and the little roasting poor rival Lou (Pierce Brosnan in his dashing pre- Bond years) has to take from a jealous old hag. And the hilarity pinnacles with two simultaneous restaurant dates, including one that has Hillard's professional future at stakes. Well, it's easy to figure where it goes, but we follow Hillard's troubles with excitement and fun.The resolution the film offers is sweet and balanced, like in Kramer vs. Kramer, it's something that appease the minds and allows us to understand both parts. The emotional outcome of the film is to remind us that Robin Williams went through divorce and didn't have to act, while it was to do these voices number that irritated Ebert or when he talked about the divorce. And looking at the film after William's untimely passing, makes it impossible to watch, without shedding a nostalgic tear.

But Mrs. Doubtfire has something for both adults and kids. There are one or two swear words but not enough to wreck the story or make it inappropriate, very little crude humor, excellent acting (one of Robin Williams' best roles) and beautiful (and at times funny) soundtrack.Daniel (Robin Williams) is a loving, caring father, absolutely adored by his three children. The problem is, his wife Miranda is all business, whereas he's a fun-loving, imaginative and at times childish voice actor. When he throws a huge party in his expensive home for his son, featuring a petting zoo, cake and ice cream and the latest hip-hop hits, with his excuse to Miranda being, it's not a toxic waste dump, it was just a party! she becomes fed up with his antics and files for divorce, tearing the kids apart from their father except on Saturdays.Daniel is heartbroken, and misses his children. Meanwhile Miranda gets straight to work turning them against him by going on about his dirty apartment and teaching his youngest daughter the phrase damned. She tells Daniel that she's going to hire a housekeeper for the kids, and Daniel seizes the opportunity, deciding to sign up for the job himself. With the help of his gay brother and his incredible voice acting, Daniel disguises himself as an elderly Scottish lady - Mrs. Doubtfire - but keeping his double-life a secret proves to be more difficult than he thought it would be, especially when Miranda gets a sleazy boyfriend named Stu.What else can I say? My dad downloaded this for me when I was a kid and it was right up there in my favorites along with Uncle Buck and Gremlins. Not only was Robin Williams an amazing actor but the acting was great from all roles, and I've got to say, my favorite scene was where Daniel, while dressing in his Mrs. Doubtfire costume, is seen by two boys from the other apartment. They giggle at him, thinking he's a woman, but then he turns around and scares them so they call for their mom. In panic, he drops his old lady mask and screams, oh sh!t, making the two boys laugh even more. Ten a truck runs over the mask! It's only one of the many hilarious scenes in this movie.I highly recommend this movie (if you're worried about its content you may want to watch it yourself first, though). I wish movies like this existed today, there was talk of a Mrs. Doubtfire 2 coming out but sadly Robin Williams committed suicide so I guess it's been canceled. At least this one exists so other children (and adults) can enjoy it for many more years to come. "},{"Title":"Perfect ending with traditional Williams comedy applied generously throughout.","Date":"13 October 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" The main role in this movie was practically tailor made for the late Robin Williams. Daniel Hillard basically *is* Robin Williams in literary form. Daniel's personality has all of the eccentricity that Williams has become known for. His performance in this movie is easily in the top three that I have seen. The storyline is very good for a comedy. For those of you who are considering viewing, the plot consists of Robin Williams' character being separated by his three kids by a divorce and disguising himself as their new nanny to be with his kids. The villain that comes in partway through adds well to the plot. Stu, played by Pierce Bronson, is a rich guy who starts dating Miranda, Daniel's wife played by Sally Field, after the divorce. I honestly don't think they could have cast Pierce Bronson for the part if it had been made after he became James Bond because there would have been such a gigantic amount of potential for Danel to make Bond references that it would have taken up too much of the movie. He is introduced more for humorous purposes than emotional ones, since most of his screen time involves Daniel, disguised as Mrs. Doubtfire, trying to inconvenience him. As it is, Stu is a fairly small character in the whole scheme of things since Daniel is just trying to be with his kids again and not his wife, The kids are the main roles apart from the parents. Each one's personality is well developed and it is clear that they have a strong averseness to the divorce and go through all of the struggles that come with it. That said, the fake nanny that Daniel disguises himself with the help of his brother helps all five of them deal with the divorce better. The whole family's quality of life improves after he begins watching his kids incognito after school. Of course, as this is a comedy, everything that happens is mixed with humorous situations. There are several scenes where Daniel forgets that he is dressed as a seventy-five year old English lady and even a couple where he has to switch egos in rapid succession to save his secret. There is also a pretty good showing of Williams vocal versatility. The opening scene where he is acting for the cartoon is the first of these, followed by his job interview with the social worker, and later when he impersonates the many different prospective nanny's responding to his wife's advertisement (this by the way is one of many scenes in older comedies that would not work after caller ID had been invented). The social worker becomes a minor character introduced for humorous purposes as she checks on Daniel's state of living for the divorce court case. The only other minor character of note is Mr. Lundy the TV producer, who comes in late. In the climatic scene at a restaurant where Daneil is supposed to be at dinner with his family as Mrs. Doubtfire and with Mr. Lundy as his real self at the same time, Daniel accidentally forgets to switch costumes and quickly explains that Mrs. Doubtfire can be the host for Mr. Lundy's new TV show. There isn't much more to address apart from the ending. I don't think anyone would deny that it is the perfect ending for the movie, which is an incredibly rare thing to find in a film. It doesn't work to have the parents get back together because it is clearly shown that they want what's best for their kids and the two have too many discrepancies for this wish to be fulfilled. It also is not aesthetically appealing to have Mrs. Doubtfire continue to watch the Hillard family after her identity is revealed. All sort of seems lost at one of the most emotional scenes of the movie when the court decrees that Daniel can only see his kids under supervision, which is obviously unfair and not how you want to end a movie. So when we discover that Daniel will now take care of his kids after school without a disguise, it pleases everyone who wants a happy ending along with those who don't want the ending to be completely implausible and corny. This is rounded perfectly with the clip from Mrs. Doubtfire's TV show as the final shot fades out. As usual, I will end with recommendations. If you have liked any other popular Robin Williams movies, you shouldn't be disappointed. If you don't mind a good plot accompanied by continuous humor, it's a good watch. The story should please most speculators, so the only reason any given viewer might not like this movie is if the style of comedy doesn't appeal to them, which is a blameless crime.

Just describing the film in a coherent sense is difficult, but imagine convincing the ignorant that this film winds up being incredibly moving, even tearjerking, as it persists on, dealing with real characters in a realistic situation in a totally unrealistic way.To put it simply, this is the best film I have seen about a serious topic like divorce taken in a family-friendly manner that is great for all ages, but doesn't compromise its ideas or themes in order to be safe and digestible for the youngest viewer. The youngest viewer, think four, who belongs to two parents, or one at a time, with visitations from the other on the weekends, would likely have no trouble connecting to this film and its concept. Not to mention, the film is actually hilarious in addition to being contemplative, heartbreaking, and genuinely moving. This balancing act screenwriters Randi Mayem Singer and Leslie Dixon pull off is nothing shy of extraordinary and, dare I say, should've come in serious consideration for a nomination during Oscar season in 1993.The film concerns Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams), a man of high-energy and great charm, who works as a voice actor in San Francisco, however, recently unemployed. He is married to the lovely, but short-fused Miranda (Sally Field), and lives with their three children, two girls and a boy, and his marriage is already on rocky waters without the threat of job loss coming into play. The back-breaking straw comes when Daniel throws his son a birthday party, complete with a petting zoo and camaraderie from neighborhood kids, after Miranda prevented their son from throwing a party after getting in trouble. Miranda wants a divorce, but Daniel is far too attached to his children, and his children far too attached to him.Daniel is now living with his brother, a professional makeup artist, prohibited from seeing his children unless on a Saturday for a three-month period where employment and domestic stability must be reached in order for a custody extension. Upon finding out his wife is searching for a babysitter for the kids, with numerous applications already filled out, Daniel tampers with the applications so he can phone-in for the ambitious clients and ruin their chances at an interview. He, himself, makes a call to his wife, posing as Mrs. Doubtfire, a loving English nanny, who has ample amount of experience working with the youngest kids and wants to provide fun but discipline for the Hillard kids. Daniel gets into costume, thanks to his brother, which involves a full-body suit, a massive brazier, and loads of makeup, and becomes the nanny he profiled over the phone, much to the delight of Miranda. With his newfound disguise, he manages to still see his children on a daily basis - obviously, though, in a different form - and still tries to be a part of their life.However, the film isn't solely about a man's desperation to see his kids and the fact that he loves them dearly and they love him. While that's certainly a part of this film, the film's about a man's transformation into adulthood in a childish and hugely questionable way. That's the irony of the story; a man is growing up by doing the most immature thing imaginable. Yet, while Daniel is draped in loads of makeup and elderly woman garb, he becomes more of a disciplinary figure, a more organized and grounded man of his word, changing his philosophy and tightening his own leash, while still remaining fun-loving and shapeless to some degree.On top of that, Singer and Dixon wisely make all the kids generally happy characters, never attaching pessimistic or needlessly dramatic stigma to one, ruining the father-children relationship or corrupting the idea that this is a wholesome family burdened by a sad state of affairs. With this, there is infinitely more relatability for audiences, seeing that it's not the fact that the father isn't involved, or the mother isn't capable, or the kids are too much to handle, but the circumstances bestowed upon the family are just a tough slice of life, where the love and romance has soured, and one can't deal with the others traits and vice-versa. With that in mind, there's no wonder why I hear this film being so relatable and helpful for those undergoing divorce or being children of divorce.The idea of a father, devoted and caring, being prevented to see his kids other than one day a week is a tough circumstance and this film doesn't sugarcoat it in the slightest. It shows one man's commitment to raising healthy kids in the most unlikely way ever. As sad as this film can be, however, make no mistake, for it is hilarious all the more. Williams' quick-witted brand of comedy delivers in every possible way, and just when you think Williams' manic energy is going to prevent for deeper emotions to come through, he blindsides by delivering a powerful monologue or showcasing complex emotions in a way that is crowdpleasing and simply wonderful in every sense.Mrs. Doubtfire is a wonderful family film, uproariously funny, heartbreaking, but honesty and consistently wholesome even in its most manic or mildly crude state. It'd be blatantly wrong to say the film isn't a tad messy or all-over-the place, but such is life, and with this great of a screenplay and such strong performances from everyone involved, I hardly minded. The film is a glorious gem that touches the spirit of what it means to be human, imperfectly so.

His wife (Sally Fields) gets sick of it after 14 years and decides to divorce him. He's a great father though. To see his kids every day, he cooks up a crazy plan to pose as a female nanny. His gay brother (Harvey Fierstein) helps him with the disguise.His plan works. He immerses into his increasingly elaborate British nanny persona, becoming a more stable and responsible person in the process. He is also able to spy on his ex-wife and her loathsome boyfriend Stu (Pierce Brosnan)and gets to be with his children (who learn the secret). Then, one night, he has to go to a job interview as himself and attend a family dinner as Mrs Doubtfire -- at the same restaurant. Will he be able to pull it off? This was a funny, enjoyable enough family movie, despite the cross dressing theme and often ribald humour. Williams is talented and hilarious, as usual.My partner enjoyed the film; I had a few problems with it. The movie almost didn't work for me. It was too contrived how crappy everything got for Daniel after the divorce. Also, I was simply unable to suspend my disbelief that his wife and kids wouldn't immediately see through the disguise. (I don't know why this didn't bother everyone else.) And after a while, the shtick of him having to change back and forth under pressure became tedious and unrealistic. The costume was too much for this to happen. The movie became too slapsticky. Nice sweet ending though.

Robin Williams at his best!","Date":"19 July 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" I am not the biggest fan of Robin Williams, but I love these family kinds of movies that he makes! I have loved watching this movie since I was a kid. It has great comedy, and both Robin Williams and Sally Fields are excellent in their roles. ****SPOILERS AHEAD***** In San Francisco, a married couple have problems. The fun actor and comedian father (Robin Williams) has no sense of discipline when it comes to his three kids, and is not able to keep a job. His career-oriented wife (Sally Fields) is left bitter and upset since she has to continually pick up the pieces (literally) from what her childish husband does, and no longer sees anything comical about her husband's behaviors. After yet another episode of her husband's irresponsibility (in which she comes home to find a petting zoo in their yard and their house in shambles), she informs him that she wants a divorce. The movie then goes on to show the struggle that this father goes through in order to put his life in order while struggling to find and keep a job that he enjoys, while also trying to keep partial custody of his children. He finds this balance by using his acting ability, along with a disguise(with the help of his brother), to be hired by his ex-wife as the nanny of his own children under the guise of Mrs. Doubtfire, an older, British woman.The hilarity continues throughout the entire movie as Mrs. Doubtfire has to deal with the jealousy of his ex-wife's new love interest (played by Pierce Brosnan) and trying to reconnect with his children as both Mrs. Doubtfire and as their father, all while trying to maintain his disguise.This movie is very fun, though there is some language and scenarios that are not meant for young children. Overall, a very fun movie that is also heartwarming!

Great, now I am back to hating on this movie.Joke. And speaking of which, this movie, though extremely formulaic, is a riot. Thanks to the perfect timing and lines from Robin Williams. When he's wacky he's hilarious. When he had low humor, it's deep and still uproarious. And when he's serious, he shows a ton of heart. Secondary characters, Sally Fields, Pierce Brosnan, Polly Holliday and Harvey Fierstein also played their roles great and often funny. Even they kids played their roles fairly well.Man both loses his job and wife fairly quickly and must learn to deal with the time away from his kids, a new life including rent and job and the fact that the only way to see his kids is to dress as an English maid, a la the title character.Really, overall, the movie's extremely harmless and an enormous amount of fun and heart, but there was that nagging feeling I got about how, even in 1993, un-accepting everyone was, including the children, of a man dressing up as a woman in&#x85;&#x85;..SAN FRANCISCO?If you can suspend your disbelief for that, you'll have a great time.

Robin Williams plays Daniel Hillard a voice over actor who got fired from his job and is set for a bitter divorce from his wife Miranda played by The Amazing Spiderman star Sally Field who has had it with him and she wants full custody of their children,so Daniel comes up with a great plan to see his kids more often by you guess it disguise himself as an old Scottish woman called Mrs Doubtfire thanks to his best friend who is a Special Effects Make Up Artist. The disguise is so good no one knows that its him behind the prosthetic mask that he wears along with the white wig and the body suit and frock. But problems arise when he finds out that his ex wife has met someone else who goes by the name Stu played by former James Bond star Pierce Brosnan. So what do I like and not like about this movie,well first what I liked about it was the acting and the humor which was brilliant,no matter what film Robin Williams is in he always makes me laugh,another thing I liked was the story because Robin's charcther was desperate to see his kids again and his wife was such a bitch to him he demanded to see them more. Also what I like about this film is the Special Make Up Effects that is done by Greg Gammon who also did the Special Make Up Effects for the 1994 film The Mask,I swear when Robin Williams was dressed up as that Scottish nanny I was shocked at it I was like saying to myself who plays that old lady that looks like Robin William's grandmother or whatever and then when he rips off the mask from his face I was like WHAT that's a dude in drag hilarious.And now to the bad I absolutely hated seeing the part where Robin Williams would switch from Daniel to Mrs Doubtfire every now and again and seeing him rip off the mask off his face,I got kinda disgusted cause that sorta creeps me out as its so real looking and you think he was ripping the skin off his face,but in saying that I really enjoyed this film and if you haven't seen it then check it out.

The characters are fleshed out so that we're all rooting for Daniel Hillard and desperately hoping that he doesn't ever get found out. It's the story about the rise of a man, who only wants to see his children, but goes about it in a very extreme and hilarious way.The screenplay is absolute genius. It's one hilarious gaga after another and on top of that you've got Robin Williams looking like a 60 year old woman delivering the lines! You only have to look at him and burst into laughter (I do). Robin Williams is absolutely perfect in the role and the moment where he gives the hard-faced Mrs.Selner a preview of all his talented voices perfectly demonstrates why he's the best man for the role.There are countless classic, funny moments throughout Mrs.Doubtfire that makes it two hour running time go in a breeze. The finale is also a comedy tour-de-force with Daniel having to battle his two identities whilst getting very drunk. The introduction of Pierce Brosnon's character, Stu is also genius. It's hilarious to see Mrs.Doubtfire getting jealous of his, especially at the pool. I'm laughing now just thinking about it.Mrs.Doubtfire also has some incredible lines such as, Stu, more of a thick soup than a name and Robin Williams makes the preposterous idea somehow believable! If you haven't seen Mrs.Doubtfire then shame on you because your missing out on my favourite comedy ever! It's pure comic genius that will have you howling with laughter. I can guarantee that.

Food allergies can be deadly. 2) The use of God's name in vain that Daniel uses, especially in front on the youngest Hillard was totally out of line. How is that family friendly? Especially in another scene when she repeats that line to her mom is more than disturbing. Even if she was encouraged to use a slightly different word, how can they let a child even pretend to say it? Kids are impressionable, especially if they see another kid doing or saying something. It's amazing what movies are labeled for the family. But that aside, I did like watching this movie and even have it on tape, but I don't recommend it for young kids. If they had left out the bad language, food poisoning and sexual innuendo, then it would've been perfect for all ages. Sorry, Robin, but I knew it was you under that mask. Besides, Tootsie, the only other male that could be 100% convincing as a old woman would be Jim Varney's 'Auntie Nelda', who BTW only wore a wig, glasses and make-up but didn't have on a new 'face'. 'Mrs. Doubtfire' was a costume worn just to see Daniel's kids. 'Auntie Nelda' was a part of the 'Worrell' family. But in seeing 'Mrs. Doubtfire', I wondered if 'she' was inspired by 'Auntie Nelda' since Jim and Robin were friends. No disrespect to Robin-who I think is funny-but I think Jim Varney's 'Auntie Nelda' was funnier. And without the use of bad language and sexual content.

Mrs Doubtfire is not the best comedy, and most certainly not the best movie, but it is a very heart-warming story about a father who is crazy about his kids, and when he gets a divorce he is willing to do anything to spend the time he needs with his children, including dressing up as a 60 year old woman.There are two major things that make this film an exception. There's Robin William's excellent display of his renowned voicing acting, and the heart-melting theme of the warmth and importance of family. There are so many occasions in this film where in one scene you want to break out in tears, and then in another, crack yourself with laughter. Mrs Doubtfire is one of those movies that you can cuddle up with at any time. The equal complexion of heart and comedy is a wonderfully touching and hilarious experience. It's something for the whole family, definitely worth the watch.

The movie sports a few genuinely funny moments, Robin Williams being Robin Williams in one of his better roles (and at his peak), and the movie represents your typical 1990s comedy flair perfectly, blending laughs with timely messages about the realities of family life, not necessarily winding up the way the audience expects (Doubtfire's feel good ending not really so happy as we might expect, but then again, that's life).Daniel Hillard is a talented voice over actor with a moral compass and a loving father to his three children. When he throws a birthday party for his son without his wife Miranda's knowledge, she takes it as the last straw and divorces her husband. At the custody hearing, the judge only allows Daniel to see his three children every Saturday, definitely not enough time in Daniel's mind. When he discovers that his wife is looking for a housekeeper, he employs the help of his brother Frank to transform him through body suits, a wig, false teeth, make-up, and glasses into an aging English housekeeper dubbed Mrs. Doubtfire. His uncanny acting skills put to the ultimate test, Daniel manages to get the job and fool his wife and children completely. He must deal with his court liaison, find a job, learn to accept (or choose to harass) his ex-wife's new boyfriend Stu and learn how to keep house, all the while maintaining his secret identity.It had been so long since I last watched Mrs. Doubtfire that I had forgotten the film was directed by Chris Columbus. As soon as the movie started, I could feel the Columbus touch even before his credit popped up on the screen. The only thing that seems to be missing is Macaulay Culkin as one of the kids. The movie screams 1990s through and through, though it is not my favorite comedy of the decade (not even my favorite Columbus movie of the decade, that title going to Only the Lonely). Still, Mrs. Doubtfire has its moments, mainly any time the Doubtfire character appears on-screen. Williams has definitely nailed the performance (and his make-up artists received a well-deserved Oscar for their work), his character rightfully a show-stopper. Despite the fact that almost every scene seemed important and added to the story, after the first hour or so I had to resist the urge to fast forward to the next scene featuring Mrs. Doubtfire. Still, Mrs. Doubtfire is charming enough to warrant a watch, and even if parts seem dull, it moves fast enough to be entertaining.

Doubtfire","Date":"11 December 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" The song Dude (look like a lady) will never be forgotten. This song is played in a memorable movie with stars, Robin Williams and Sally Fields, winning an Oscar along with a Golden Globe. Robin Williams plays one of his best roles as Mrs. Doubtfire, even though this movie was made in 1993 it is still a sensational hit today. Filled with comedy and still showing real life by telling the truth of how bad parents only get to see their kids when someone else is watching, and only for a limited of time, this movie was truly made before its time! Robin Williams acting as Daniel Hillard is in a testing relationship and becomes a divorced father who is at stake of only being able to see his kids for a limited time on certain days. Williams then turns in to Mrs. Doubtfire, a cross-dressing old English nanny, in an attempt to see his children and to be with them everyday. This clever plan turns in to a tremendous disaster and Daniel may never see his children again. The cameras are brilliantly used by zooming in on peoples faces at the right moment and making the audience feel as if they are in the movie. One example is when Mrs. Hillard yells it's over in one of the fights with her husband. Daniel says it can not be over because they love each other. After that point the camera zooms in slowly on Mrs. Hillard's face to show that she is not even sure that she loves her husband anymore. Although throughout the whole movie eye-level camera action was used. This makes you feel like you are actually involved in the movie and at times like that character was talking to you. Increasing the emotion that you feel for the characters. During the court room scene, going over the divorce, a rear lighting was used, which may have been indicating that Daniel is truly not that bad of a father. The music also adds to the effect that Mrs. Doubtfire is actually a man. Including the songs of Dude (Looks Like a Lady) and Walk like a Man which will make you want to get up and dance.Characters in this movie do not only consist of humans. The body suit and mask that are worn by Daniel become a person of its own, a beloved English nanny who any person would love to have help around the house. Robin Williams does a great job making the mask come to life working it from every direction possible from walking like a women to giving womanly advice. Anyone who would skip the scene of the making of the mask and going directly to when the kids are introduced to their new nanny would think that Mrs. Doubtfire is a first class, life saving nanny.This movie is definitely one you could watch over and over again and not get sick of it, so show a smile, have a few laughs and shed some tears. For Mrs. Doubtfire (1993) is one that will settle in your heart after you have only watched it once. It has just enough comedy in the right ways. As well as the serious side of showing how a divorced father holds on to the only thing in life that matters to him, which are his children. So if your ever looking for a good movie to watch, Mrs. Doubtfire (1993) is a great one to pick up! I give this movie a rating of four stars out of five meaning this movie is fantastic, but not jaw dropping. "},{"Title":"Movie From A Critical Point of View","Date":"16 September 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" Now there are some serious fans of Robin Williams that will give some biased answers but I will look at the good and the bad both. First this film was not to seem extremely realistic but funny with good morales being taught. The plot is about divorce and how children cope through an event. Now as a film for entertainment it is very good because of the comedic side (that's if you like comedy). As a film just to waste time on and do nothing it's not the film for you because there is lots of morale taught here and role modeling. As a film to help children I would say it is very good for Child psychology because Divorce for children is very difficult for them to understand and this film is good role modeling about the feelings children have. Let's look at the Pro's and Con's Pro's (Goods) 1. It is a movie with lots of good morales taught. 2. Is movie that raises hope for children 3. Comedy is done very well with much satire on the old idea of cross dressing. 4. The Actors are very good and experienced so their skill is brought into the film Con's (Bad) 1. There are a few slip ups on the camera but if you haven't watched it time and time again you won't notice it. 2. Somewhat demonizes the female or single mother. But this depends on point of view. Single mothers are just as good as single fathers Now this depends on your own personal point of view. Overall if you want a good comedy with some emotions and morals thrown in then this is a very fulfilling movie. If you want only comedy and no meaning and no lessons to be learned then this may not satisfy you. Personally this is a very good comedy and would be considered a family movie. I give it 5 stars but again this depends on what you want. "},{"Title":"Funny movie","Date":"12 September 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" Robin Williams dressing up as a woman and playing nanny for his kids is the perfect idea to make a very funny comedy. Williams plays Mrs. Doubtfire (wearing an Oscar-winning makeup job, one of many roles before Good Will Hunting that could have won him an Oscar). Williams' smooth comic delivery and brilliant portrayal of a 60-year-old woman is hysterical here, making a very enjoyable film. This is similar to Tootsie, with some scenes, such as Williams putting on his female disguise, that look like they came right out of that film. This movie, however, does not have quite the same laugh-a-minute feel that Tootsie had, for several reasons. First, though it is very funny, this movie has the heavy topic of divorce looming over it, with the parents (Williams and Sally Field) arguing in just about every scene together. Also, one disappointing thing about the movie is the fact that it had the perfect plot and potential of being a great family film. However, the sexual humor, profanity, and the PG-13 rating would make this inappropriate for a number of family audiences. Nevertheless, even with its flaws, it is a very funny film, particularly the scenes with Williams changing back and forth to himself and Mrs. Doubtfire and the restaurant scene toward the end. Worthwhile for just about any lover of good comedy. By the way, some TV stations edit this film to remove the profanity and make it more suitable for families, if you think your family would be interested.*** out of **** "}{"Title":"Funny, but sometimes overly sentimental.

Nothing in the movie quite lived up to that scene but there are a fair amount of scenes that will raise a laugh. However I can't give this top marks because the attmepts to be moving often made me wince in embarrassment. The biggest gripe though is that Mrs Doubtfire claims to be from England yet speaks with a Scottish accent. It would be similar if an American nanny came to England and claimed to be from New York yet spoke with a Texas accent. Even a Brit would know the difference. Are Americans really unable to differentiate such different accents? Whether this is an oversight or intended for comedic effect isn't too clear. As a movie with a moral or message I can appreciate that it may ty, but often fails. As a comedy though I give it a casual thumbs up.

Now the only way he can see his kids regularly is if he pretends to be a qualified nanny.15 years on from its release, it's still a great watch, with fun characters and a bizarre yet extraordinary story about a lovable man who will literally do anything to see his kids.One thing that I have noticed on watching this film many times over the last decade, is that the humour is never lost, particularly not on Williams part. His acting in timing and tones of voices are exquisite and precise, one of only a few comedy Oscar winning actors who can do such a thing. And though the writing and sheer idea of the plot is brilliant, a sensational lead was required to do justice and make the film one of the best family flicks ever created.This 1993 Oscar winning comedy drama fills the genre brilliantly, and is a tremendous sit back and enjoyable family film with something for everyone. The children are likable, though the acting is off key.Sally Field (Forrest Gump) and Pierce Brosnan (Goldeneye) have their moments in a pretty conventional love story, though with a few good twists and Mrs Doubtfire the bit in-between.The direction and lighting are good, as are the settings. But it's the dialogue and the sheer idea of the film that makes it great. There were rumours last year there was to be a sequel, or a spin off. I personally hope there is nothing added, as this felt so much like a one off and the classics should never be meddled with.

Recently, he was playing the lead in the movie Mrs. Doubtfire, which was released in 1993. You see, Mrs. Doubtfire is about an actor who lived in San Francisco, California, and can disguise himself as a female nanny named Mrs. Doubtfire throughout the film.The movie opens with a four minute cartoon directed by Chuck Jones (of the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons, and not to mention How the Grinch Stole Christmas!) called Pudgy Parakeet featuring the Chuck Jones versions of the Looney Tunes characters Sylvester, Tweety, and Granny known as Grunge the Cat, Pudgy the Parakeet, and an old lady doing the knitting, all voiced by Robin Williams.Somewhere in the movie, William's character goes to a TV Studio, where one of the sets featuring Prehistoric Life, and at that, he plays with some toy dinosaurs. Toward the end of the movie, William's character as Mrs. Doubtfire talks to a monkey Muppet named Kovacs (voiced by Chris Pray).The catchy songs they used in this movie soundtrack are interesting, including the song Stormy Monday Blues performed by B. B. King (of Yakety Yak, Take it Back) and Albert Collins.Overall, I gave this movie two, or 2, thumbs up to this movie, and a hats off to Mr. Williams himself. Let's hear it for Robin Williams!

Williams is marvelous, the references, the voices, the whole thing, and he delivers on the pathos, as well. The plot is great, and develops nicely. There are pretty predictable parts, but this did surprise me at times. The humor is very good, some childish material, and a part or two are gross-out comedy, but the majority is hilarious, especially if you're into Robin(the actor, not the bird nor the mercilessly slain, if he was hardly the only thing, character of the two Schumacher Batman movies). There are several jokes that are sexual(one certain part seems to have about every alluding phrase that they could get away with in a family film in it), and not all kids should watch it. The drama of this is well-done as well, and the ending was a heckuva lot better than it could have been(in particular with Chris in the director's chair). The music is magnificent. The acting varies, the young 'uns aren't all credible, but that only serves a minor distraction.

It's the type of movie that touches your heart and makes you laugh good. My main objective to discuss here was that Robin Williams had done such an amazing job; every time I watch this movie and get to the part where Mrs. Doubtfire enters through the door of Miranda Hillard, I always forget that it is Miranda's husband Daniel Hillard underneath that disguise but maybe in fact a real Mrs. Doubtfire. I always look at the old woman as though if she were a real Mrs. Doubtfire, because the acting is just so convincing and so real. I love the old lady, Mrs. Doubtfire! It only shows how desperate a father can be to see his own children, and most importantly shows that he loves his children that much and cannot live without them. I thought it was incredibly sweet in the end for Miranda to talk to the judge and have all those legal conditions for Daniel taken off his shoulders in order to see his children. I love Daniel and Mrs. Doubtfire's characters, because those are the kind of great people children need for emotional and inspirational guidance. Mrs. Doubtfire brought out the best in that whole family when really it was Daniel Hillard who had done that! That was to prove that Daniel was way much a better man and a better husband and father, and he had greatly proved that to Miranda and his three children. I also wanted to add that when Daniel calls his ex-wife, using all those fake voices pretending to be those fake, non-existent, make-believe people, his voices all sounded too very much the same, and Miranda could have easily recognized that all those voices sounded too similar and that in fact it could have really been her ex-husband. Also, Miranda's reaction frightened me a bit when she found out that it was her ex-husband pretending to be Mrs. Doubtfire the whole time. This movie is emotional, funny, outstanding, and an excellent job well done! Robin Williams has great, funny talent!

Underneath all the trademark Williams mimicry there's a rather touching story of a family finding some stability again, but this is often on the verge of being lost amidst segments that feel like hollow promotional stunts. Personally, if I never have to see that clip of Robin Williams dancing to Aerosmith with a vacuum cleaner again, then I won't be sorry. Ignore the advertising, though, and there's still enough worthwhile moments in the film to send most people away happy.Williams is convincing and poignant when he's being low-key. Both Field and Brosnan help to keep proceedings moderately realistic, too.

His character, voice actor Daniel Hillard, is devastated to learn that his wife Miranda (Sally Field), a professional interior designer, wants a divorce. He becomes even more devastated when Miranda obtains full custody of their three children, with Daniel only receiving visitation rights on Saturdays. But Daniel is such a loving and devoted father that one day a week is not enough for him to spend quality time with his children. When he learns that Miranda is seeking the services of a housekeeper, he decides he must make his move, no matter how unorthodox.My favorite highlights from Mrs. Doubtfire include the following (DO NOT read any further if you have not yet seen this movie). The wild birthday party scene near the beginning is quite fun to watch. Daniel performs a wide range of vocal imitations in order to try to impress his court liaison Mrs. Sellner (Anne Haney). On his first day posing as British nanny Euphegenia Doubtfire, Daniel's rubber body suit catches fire when he realizes he is not as good of a cook as he thought. Daniel goes about his daily routine of posing as Mrs. Doubtfire to the montage accompaniment of Aerosmith's Dude (Looks Like a Lady); Mrs. Doubtfire becomes rather unladylike when fighting a thug (played by Robin Williams' costume supervisor Jim Cullen) who tries to snatch her purse. At the posh restaurant, Daniel nervously goes back and forth between being himself and being Mrs. Doubtfire, which is how he ultimately earns his gig of hosting a TV show for children. And finally, Miranda is nearly brought to tears as she watches the closing of one of Mrs. Doubtfire's shows, during which Mrs. Doubtfire delivers a deeply moving monologue about children who are forced to live with broken families.Mrs. Doubtfire is a fine comedy with so much charm. Nobody but Robin Williams could have played the role of Daniel Hillard, a terrifically funny guy and devoted father willing to do anything in order to spend more time with his children; boasting an English accent and expertly crafted makeup, Daniel becomes quite convincing as Mrs. Doubtfire. Sally Field was a wonderful choice for the role of Miranda, a very loving mother and expert interior designer. Not to mention Pierce Brosnan as Miranda's new beau Stuart Dunmire, Harvey Fierstein as Daniel's homosexual brother Frank (who supplies Daniel with his Mrs. Doubtfire makeup and wardrobe), and Lisa Jakub, Matthew Lawrence, & Mara Wilson as the three Hillard children. To top it off, the cartoon animation at the beginning of this film (for which Daniel provides the voices) was supervised by Chuck Jones, one of the most well-known animation directors for the classic Warner Bros. cartoons.

There's something hilarious about seeing men in drag, and Hollywood certainly has had some gifted men in a dress and heels. This time it's Robin Williams' turn, and he's fantastic. Sporting a high-pitched British-Irish accent, a wig, body suit, and a latex face made for him by his gay brother (Harvey Fierstein), Danny, as Mrs. Doubtfire, applies for a job as his kids' nanny. As the treasure Mrs. Doubtfire, Danny accomplishes the one thing he couldn't while he was married - his wife's friendship. He becomes so much more than a nanny. He's a confidant to his wife Miranda (Sally Field) and when she starts dating an old beau (Pierce Brosnan), Mrs. D tries to thwart the relationship. When Miranda holds up two cocktail dresses and asks Mrs. D's advice about which dress to wear on her date, Mrs. Doubtfire replies, straight-faced Neither. Both of them scream harlot. As usual with Williams, the one-liners come fast and his delivery is perfect.Sally Field is always excellent, as is the rest of the cast, but it's Williams' show. He's so much more than funny - he's warm, he's sad, he gives a perfect picture of an at-loose-ends divorced man who suddenly has no house, no wife, and children he sees once a week. The script gives him ample opportunities to do quick gender changes, and there are some real laugh out loud moments, particularly the scene in the restaurant toward the end.This is a wonderful and touching movie. If you try to ground it in reality, you'll be disappointed not only in this, but in many comedies. To me, Mrs. Doubtfire looked like a fat, bewigged Robin Williams. In real life, Miranda would have been suspicious that it was Danny making all those ridiculous phone calls to apply for the job of nanny - she knows he's a voice specialist.

I had heard of the movie before and heard it's funny.It's actually more than that, as I was watching.What would a divorced man do to get his wife and family back? It seems more ways than one. Daniel (Robin Williams) does voice-overs for cartoon and he quit when he and the production team cannot agree on the direction the cartoon is going. His wife Miranda (Sally Field) is a successful career woman, but always very strict in her three children's upbringing. When Miranda returned from work and found out that how the house had turned into given her husband had threw a birthday party for their son, she knew it's the last straw.Soon Daniel found out that his estranged wife needed a housekeeper to take care of their children and Daniel decided to do a female voice over the telephone, trying his luck and saying 'she' is Mrs. Doubtfire. It worked and he asked his friends to help him to look like a real woman. But the wife never realised it though at first.One can expect how the wife felt she realised she was being taken in all along that the female housekeeper...is actually a he. And her estranged husband even. Also at that time, Daniel is on the verge of hosting a children's TV show and when one day she saw her estranged husband (dressing up as Mrs Doubtfire) on the television, she knew what she had to do.Humour aside, it is also touching as well.

DOUBTFIRE, a delightful Disneyesque comedy about an out of work actor who disguises himself as a woman (thanks to an Oscar winning makeup job) in order to be hired by his ex-wife (Sally Field)to be housekeeper to his kids. Williams delivers one of his most on-target comedic performances,much of which I'm sure was improvised. The scene with Anne Haney in the employment office where he does all the different voices I'm sure came right off the top of Robin's head as did his private kids' show in the empty TV studio with the toy dinosaurs, but even on script, Williams makes this work and has you routing for Daniel to be reunited with his children (and how adorable was Mara Wilson in this movie?). Sally Field plays the thankless role of the somewhat callous ex with sincerity and Pierce Brosnan is charming as the new man in Field's life. Harvey Fierstein also provides chuckles as Daniel's gay brother who provides him with Mrs. Doubtfire's look. A charming and funny comedy the whole family can enjoy together.

There's only a few minor language. Nothing that can't be censored. So open your home to Robin Williams and this here classic film.

There are many funny moments in this movie, but just as many times where we get to think about what divorce means to all those involved.In Mrs. Doubtfires words ...sometimes mommies and daddies still love each other, but they just can't live together anymore. It's OK to have divorced parents; still better than to live with married parents who can't get along. My favorite scene is the walk-by fruiting of the Pierce Brosnan character. Sally Field is lovable as always as the mom who can't take another day of her husband's childish antics. A family pleaser, and an excellent platform addressing an important issue.

In order to have a chance for the job, Daniel must transform himself into Mrs. Doubtfire, a British nanny, and don a wig, glasses, lots of makeup, padding, high heels, and a British accent. Mirands hires Doubtfire on the spot, and the kids grow to love her. But how long will it be before the cat gets out of the bag? Also, how will Miranda's relationship with Stu (Pierce Brosnan), her new beau, progress? You have to see it to believe it. I thought it was funny when it came out back in 1993, and I still do! This is a great film with a message about the pains of divorce, and working through it to become better people and parents. A reminder that no one is perfect, but that love somehow prevails!

Man meets woman, man and woman marry, man and woman have three cutesy kids, man and woman divorce, man dresses up as woman to be with his kids... Oops, hang on a minute.Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) is an actor, the type who perpetually seems to be losing one gig then searching for another - not least of all as he has a certain tendency to be difficult, deciding to rewrite scripts to suit his own beliefs. He's married to Miranda (Sally Field), pretty much his antithesis as the smart-dressed business-headed interior designer. They have three kids ranging from five to thirteen, and a pretty home in San Francisco (well it must be, as it has hills and cable cars).But all is not peachy. On returning home from work early to find a veritable menagerie of farm animals and children running roughshod over her house courtesy of a Daniel-driven birthday party for their son, an argument ensues until Miranda has finally had enough, and citing the usual clichés (we've grown apart, we have nothing in common) asks Daniel for the dreaded 'D' word. Bye bye fourteen years of marriage.The three kids absolutely dote on their father, as he does on them, so his departure (in his wood-paneled station wagon, the type of car that only people in movies seem to drive) is devastating. Daniel seeks refuge with his brother, Frank, a stereotypical gay guy (played with great gusto by Harvey Fierstein, who tends to get a lot of these roles) and his partner Jack (he's Aunt Jack to the kids, but seems to have foregone the bright blue dress and boxing glove here). It's here that we discover that the couple are movie makeup artists - hmm, now this could be a handy plot device...Custody proceedings ensue, and Daniel is given 90 days to land a secure job and set up a decent home. If he manages to do so then joint custody will be granted, if not it's the one-day a week shuffle for he and the kids. He's appointed a po-faced court liaison who he completely fails to charm, finds a dump of a flat and lands a job in television - boxing and shipping film cans. Hardly auspicious, but it's a start.As Miranda starts a 'flirtin' with an old acquaintance, Stu (Pierce Brosnan), and Daniel sees the slick Englishman finagling his way into his kids' affections, he becomes increasingly desperate, and when hearing that Miranda is employing a housekeeper the old light bulb above his head tinks to life - hmm, now why can't he do it? Well, let's see. You're a forty something, remarkably craggy and hirsute man whose absence from the house is the reason for the job coming up in the first place. The odds aren't too good, but with a dowdy skirt, a generous amount of padding and a lot of help from your brother and his skills, who knows? And so Mrs Doubtfire is 'born' - a sixty-five year old nanny with an accent that veers all over the place between English and Scottish, and a face that could sink a thousand ships. Even with a head covered in prosthetics and three feet of makeup 'she' is definitely a sight.Overall 7.5/10 "},{"Title":"A funny, genial, delightful comedic hit","Date":"17 September 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":"  Mrs. Doubtfire is one of the most intelligent, eloquent and sincerely funny pieces of entertainment I have ever seen, succeeding on multiple levels with many delights which appeal to many audiences. So it is hardly a wonder this good-hearted comedy became one of the biggest and greatest comedic hits of all time. First of all, Robin Williams is ingeniously clever and right on the mark in his role as a desperate father legally estranged from his children posing as a domestic nanny. His voice articulation is brilliant one would never perceive he is anything BUT an old, genial, eloquent Englishwoman, and nobody would think to question, behind the infallible makeup, that this woman is actually a man! The screenplay is excellent, providing charm, eloquence, and jocularity to an already wonderful and amusing premise. As previously noted of Williams, the acting is superb and totally convincing (Sally Field hits the mark as a confused, stressed, recently divorced mother trying to stay sane). Mrs. Doubtfire hardly never fails to deliver with its many moments of comedy (not too raunchy, not too fresh), messages of family appreciation (everybody needs a parent who cares), and whim (who doesn't enjoy a macho man portray a sweet old lady?).

It was her turn to pick the movie and I wasn't particularly happy with her choice. Don't get me wrong, I love (good) comedies, but I had doubts(fire) about this one. The movie started with that cartoon scene, where the bird is singing Figaro (dubbed by Daniel Hillard/Robin Williams). For some reason my friend thought this was the funniest thing she had ever seen and started to laugh uncontrollably and soon the whole theatre joined in. The mood was set and everybody (even me) was ready to be entertained and most off all to keep an open mind. The years went by and DVD players and DVD's were becoming popular, so I started buying movies I liked or just wanted to have. One of those purchases was the 'Mrs. Doubtfire' DVD and I'm still glad I bought it. I watched it a zillion times already and it never bores me. The only thing that bothered me was the fact that some great scenes were deleted from the end cut. They showed some less sugar sweet scenes which would have made the movie more 'real'. These outtakes also included some 'magic' between Mrs. Doubtfire and the neighbour. They should have left that stuff in and trimmed the horribly slow beginning. I like this movie and that's why I forgive it it's many flaws. It's not great art here, not the best comedy ever made, not the greatest acting, not the best story ever told... Some scenes really bug me, like- The Mrs. Doubtfire cleaning dance (I hate those video clip style interludes).- The youngest one, Nathalie Hillard, who's been cute as hell one too many times. Alright, small sweet children are cute, enough already!- From the opening of the movie to the point were Mrs. Doubtfire finally appears on full screen is dragged out!- Although Robin Williams is brilliant in improvising (lot's of scenes were not scripted, until R.W. improvised them), I hate that part were he goes to the social worker and has to explain what he does for a living (Daniel Hillard 'I do voices'). Good improvising, but not all that funny, too long a scene and somewhat breaks the flow of the movie.- The dramatic court scenes, again unbelievable and dragged out Hollywood style.- Sometimes it seems they ignored the great scenes by making them as short as possible and stretching the bad and annoying one's out.- The 'family movie' (family values, feelings, morality...) approach is annoying, to sickening. They hit you in the face with it.- The story is stretched beyond believe and incoherent. Many scenes make you go 'Yeah right!' SO! Why is it, that despite all those (and I named just a few) flaws, the movie still works? It's just pure entertainment and fun. There are enough enjoyable and classic parts that will last you a lifetime. You tend to forget or forgive the bad, just because the great moments are so much fun. This is the proof that a movie, potentially a disaster, made it after all. I would like to see a re-edit, were the delete scenes are put in back and the corny scenes are trimmed to a minimum.I give it 7/10.

I am stunned at the quality.Understand that Robin Williams has very limited range to his acting.  See the opening scenes of Mrs. Doubtfire where he quits his job -dubbing voices into cartoons - over a trivial moral issue. Is the scene convincing? Does he appear to have the right level of passion to truly walk out on his job?  No. As an actor, he is merely Robin Williams in his films.  But his manic side really distinguishes him from any other actor alive.Sally Field, however, is a great actress (and greatly unappreciated, too.)  She has the range to do almost anything - but cracking jokes is not her forte, and manic is not within her range at all.So what happens?  Robin is enormously funny when he is getting his makeup applied by Harvey Fierstein, gigging the court-appointed monitor, and tormenting Pierce Brosnan.  But in the Robin-only scenes, the film stands still -as if he is doing a stand-up routine.But when Sally is on-camera, the story moves.... and there is emotional power in the scenes.  She is dead-on convincing in almost every scene, in almost every emotional state.  She tells no jokes and creates a realness and a context that brings the best out of Robin's  emoting.  There would be no movie without Robin, but it is Sally that makes the movie something much more than Three Men and A Baby.Even Pierce Brosnan works - in an unusual twist he plays a male version of the type of role that many gorgeous actresses are accustomed to play - his role is simply to be good-looking and charming so that other characters can be jealous or lust-filled.  And yet, even he shows 3-dimensionality to his character, with the help of some sensitive script-writing.So its a triumph - a genuinely interesting and fun film. Bravo!

DOUBTFIRE ***1/2A suburban family has been going through a bad time, and although everything looks set to continue with constant grudges and niggles, the parents three children eventually split up.  The mother keeps the house and the three children, because of the fathers incapacity to live a &#145;normal' life.  Williams plays a kind of eccentric comic time- bomb, who seems to have so much to give, but often misplaces his creative ideas.  The image we get is that he tries desperately hard, but somehow things just don't go to plan. His wife on the other hand seems organised, focused and disciplined.  The court's verdict is that Daniel (Williams) must hold down a steady job, live a steady life and show signs of progress.  Daniel is heartbroken that he cannot see his children unless these demands are met and in a desperate bid to keep in touch with his children, he turns himself into an ageing nanny, Mrs. Doubtfire, who hails from Britain.  She can &#145;hip hop, bee bop and dance till you drop' as one line sums it up.  At the start the children are sad about their father not being there for them, but eventually Mrs. Doubtfire brings out a happiness in the entire family that had long been forgotten in the house.  A tale of happiness as they gallop off into the sunset.  But no, there is more to this excellent film than just this.  Williams is sensational as the nanny giving him a licence to do what he does best, act in his own style with comic genius.  The whole movie is a joy which I found heart-warming, heart-breaking and ultimately satisfying.  It doesn't patronise the viewer with perfect answers, just the best of what's on offer.  In their own way, the many pieces come together to create an excellent movie.  The children act superbly with a distinct air of believability, something not always seem in movies.  Miranda (Daniels Wife) shows the full range of emotions throughout, and of course the object of hate played by Pierce Brosnan as Miranda's new boyfriend does a fine job for between jokes. Undoubtedly though Williams shines through.  Displaying a passion to see his children, emotion at what he has to go through, balancing daily life, and hiding his identity from those closest to him.  Mostly funny, sometimes sad, the movie does more than just give Williams a vehicle to be silly, it promotes a lot of sound issues and basis itself on a reality that no easy answers can be obtained because of the fighting, but sound solutions can be offered in an amicable way.  A very good movie. "},{"Title":"A delightful film","Date":"28 September 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":"  I've seen this movie over a hundred of times,and what can I say?

Yes, Williams is in drag and dons lots of funny voices but the film is actually a heartbreaking and sometimes painful look at divorce but is still laugh out loud funny at many points and a highly entertaining film.Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) is an eccentric dad who does voices for cartoons. After being fired and throwing his son a huge over the top birthday, his wife Miranda (Sally Field, in an excellent performance) decides it's time to do what she's been putting off for a long time... Divorce. Heartbroken at not being able to spend time with his children, Daniel uses his voice impersanation skills and a little make-up from his brother to become Mrs. Doubtfire, an eccentric English maid. But can he keep his guise for long enough?What really is great about 'Doubtfire' is the performances. Robin Williams and Sally Field are on top form and play very well as both Daniel and Miranda, and Mrs. Doubtfire and Miranda. It's also a good sign when even supporting actors deliver excellent performances. Not only do we have three amazingly talented child actors, but Pierce Brosnan, Harvey Fierstein and others all impress in their small but memorable roles.The remarkable thing is that the film doesn't dumb down divorce. It is divorce as it really happens, not a softened up version, but a warts and all version. This quality alone makes the film an even stronger picture. The directing is carried out by Chris Columbus (Only the Lonely, Home Alone, Harry Potter) who shows a real care for the characters. It's once in a blue moon when you can actually say that a children's film has excellent camerawork and dialogue. The writing is based on the children's book 'Alias Madame Doubtfire' by Anne Fine. It is expertly adapted by Leslie Dixon and Randi Singer.

Robin's role as a divorced father who wants to spend more time with his children is actually truly believable. Even his role as Mrs. Doubtfire is performed superbly. Too bad, there is no sequel to this film. And the fact that San Francisco plays a big role in the movie is another reason to see it. Like New York City, San Francisco plays a character in this film. It is America's most beautiful city to be compared with the likes of Paris and London. Don't miss this movie! It really is a family oriented film. There are great performances by a superb cast including Sally Field, Pierce Brosnan, Harvey Fierstein, and Anne Haney. Robin was sure robbed of an Academy Award nomination. It could not have been easy to put on so much makeup and transform himself into Mrs. Doubtfire. My favorite scene is the transformation with Harvey Fierstein where Robin uses his great voice to experiment with a Cuban Doubtfire, a Yiddish Doubtfire, and singing Matchmaker with Fierstein is the best part of the film.

Really the only thing the other two did was smile or frown, and say why can't dad be here? But besides that it is a real good movie and it's a surprisingly long movie, which comedies are usually about an 145. This one was over two hours, but it's certainly one the best comedies made, and I forgot by how much I enjoyed this movie. It's worth more than a 6.4, more like 7.0-7.5/10 maybe on the top 250 even, but not the top 100. Anyway, this a great comedy and I give a 10/10. The final showdown in the restaurant is worth to watch the movie alone. It's hilarious and extremely well done. I applaud you Chris Columbus!P.S. I know I rated, this movie 10/10, and I said it should have a 7.0-7.5?10, I meant for the average rating.

I remember seeing this hit a couple times when it was originally released in theaters but it's been quite a while between viewings but I was pleasantly surprised to see how well the film held up. There are still many, many problems in the film but the main goal here was to be a showcase for Williams and it's certainly that. The highlights are certainly Williams going all out and delivering a marvelous performance not only as Mrs. Doubtfire but also as the father. I thought Williams did a very good job at handling the role of the struggling father even if the screenplay lets the film down with a few of these dramatic moments that I'll talk about later. Williams handles every situation wonderfully well but there's no doubt the real genius comes in the role of Doubtfire. The way he plays this character isn't simply him in a fat suit and make up but instead he really delivers a true performance and makes this character feel real and not just some put on. I think Williams perfectly nails this character so well that one could pass it off as a real English woman. He perfectly handles all the comedy scenes and that includes two sequences that rank as some of the best screwball moments of the decade. There are two sequences where he must go back and forth between the father role and that of Doubtfire and these scenes get the biggest laughs of the movie. This is especially true towards the end of the film when he has to spend time with the family as Doubtfire as well as impress a hopeful boss as the father. Field and Pierce Brosnan turn in fine supporting work but there's no question that the film belongs to Williams. I think there are a few major flaws with the film, which includes the biggest and that's the final twenty-minutes of the film when we enter some rather very dark moments including a very distasteful courtroom scene where Williams' character's mental issues are questioned. This was just way too dark for all the laughs that preceded it. The actual ending is one you'd expect but even it doesn't work out overly well. With that said, this is still one of the better, mainstream comedies of the 90s and Williams performance makes it a must see. "},{"Title":"Fun For The Kids, But As A Film This Is Way Overrated","Date":"27 December 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" Robin Williams has starred in some good films Good Morning Vietnam, Insominia; he also starred in a few unforgettable ones too. Mrs Doubtfire was a film I used to love as a kid- I first remembered that as soon as it came out on video, I snapped it up quick. I used to watch it over and over because I couldn't get enough of it, but as I got older, I watched Mrs Doubtfire for the first time in my 20s a few years back, and afterwards, I could never get my head around the hype of this movie, as I realised how unrealistic this portrayal of divorcée parents was. Miranda- played by a somewhat mis casted Sally Field- decides to divorce husband Daniel (Robin Williams), after enduring years of his mis haps and childish shenanigans, especially when she arrives home to a group of screaming kids messing up the house and discovering that Daniel has thrown a birthday party for his son, which descends into chaos.Daniel is devastated-, although he is just as devastated when he is told by the court that he can only have the kids once a week, which prompts him to turn to his gay brother and boyfriend for support. With latex, a cheap wig, a dress and a pair of stockings, he later becomes Mrs Doubtfire- a Scottish nanny, of whom Miranda hires to look after the children, whilst she goes off to work. Miranda gets a new boyfriend named Stuart, played by Pierce Brosnan and here he comes across as a somewhat slimy, two-faced piece of work. But he only gets a few lines and as Stuart, character-wise he was so pedestrian and almost one-dimensional.Mrs Doubtfire is a comical farce- but whilst Robin Williams efforts as Mrs Doubtfire are at times funny, I thought the circumstances that led to the couple's break up was, for a comedy, just ridiculous. Plus, the conclusion was rather out of sync and so far removed from reality. I understand that with divorce cases especially when kids are involved, there is hardly a happy ending. And whilst the last scenes did imply that there was some hope for Miranda and Daniel, the truth is they are no longer together as a couple and are no longer in love with one another. The ending was neither here or there-although it was realistic enough to be believed. In fact, the ending was much more believable than the other aspects of the film itself.The cast were at best okay I've seen Robin Williams act better and do better than in this movie, I thought Sally as Miranda was too stuck-up and as I said earlier, she was mis-casted as that character.And by the way, Mrs Doubtfire was indeed Scottish, not English as the writers of the film have pointed out.Having said that, the gag's and jokes, whilst they were enjoyable for a few times, eventually became tedious and tiresome. The sentimentality of it became nauseating and the cutesy factor was short-lived. The younger ones will love it more, i'm sure but for a so-called family film dealing with the complicated issue of divorce, Mrs Doubtfire was at most sappy and saccharine sweet.Mrs Doubtfire is not Tootsie- it is nowhere as good as Tootsie; yes this film can be funny on occasions but in all, it just doesn't cut it. It is just a tad too long, too predictable and with some scenes, you often have to wait for some time for something really interesting to happen within the film.In all though, this is a rather bog-standard affair, with nothing remotely new to offer to the audience. It is a film about a guy who dresses up as a woman, in order for him to see his children. With Tootsie, it's about a guy- who like Daniel is an actor- who dresses up as a woman in order for him to secure a part in a daytime soap opera. That movie is far more substantial and interesting; some would say it is also funnier than Mrs Doubtfire, which is in truth more of a melodrama, rather than a comedy-based film.Mrs Doubtfire is at best very average, but it is way overrated and compared to Some Like It Hot and Tootsie, it trails behind by a couple of metres. It is a rehash of the cross-dressing elements of those films juxtaposed onto a family friendly context, but it is done in a not so successful and efficient way.This is really a poor man's Tootsie, and whilst it can be funny at times, it does come across as being banal and predictable for a movie that Mrs Doubtfire is.

So he disguises himself as a nanny for the kids, when his ex-wife (Sally Field) is at work. And how he is able to maintain this as well as his own life and career is the rest of the story.

However, this is pretty much a heartfelt story about a man who can't bear being separated from his kids and doing everything in his power to see them.

Most of the characters are strongly executed with decisive dialogue. They are also beautifully written with tainted personalities and uncompromising wit. Chris Columbus has assembled a stellar dramatic comedy with excellent screen writing, giving audiences one of the most punctually artful films I have ever witnessed. I don't really agree with this. I wouldn't quite call it a punctually artful film. There's nothing artful about a hairy guy stuffing a cake onto his face to make it look like an exfoliating cream. Or running around swapping clothes in a restaurant like a frantic ape.But this movie is funny... and for as slapstick as its humor is, it's also surprisingly human in nature, which is something Blake touched upon in his review.Robin Williams stars as Daniel, a guy whose wife (Sally Field) leaves him with their three kids after he misses his kid's birthday party. (Ooh, talk about grounds for divorce!) Daniel loves his kids, though, so he dresses up as a woman with prosthetic effects and becomes their nanny under the false identity of an Irish (?) housekeeper named Mrs. Doubtfire.Meanwhile Daniel's ex-wife begins dating a rich and suave English businessman (Pierce Brosnan pre-James Bond) and he becomes jealous, trying to ruin their relationship under the guise of Doubtfire.This movies is quite similar to the Dustin Hoff classic comedy Tootsie in terms of plotting. They're both quite funny and some of the only guy-in-drag films that are actually good.Williams is funny (one of his last truly humorous performances) and totally steals the spotlight from everyone else - including Brosnan.Chris Columbus (Home Alone) has a way of making over-the-top films while managing to restrain them to the elements of humanity, and that's the clearest thing about this film - what makes it funny and, ultimately, so likable, even when it's not cracking us up consistently.

Time after time we see Mrs Doubtfire succeed where Daniel himself has failed -- particularly in terms of providing some sort of firm guidance for the children. And in terms of being a trusted companion for wife Miranda.On the lighter side, one of my favourite scenes is where Mrs Doubtfire is doing the housework to music enthusiastically dancing and playing the vacuum-cleaner like a guitar. Another is where she is sprung going to the toilet standing up.Everything builds up to an amazing climax, with the scene at Bridges restaurant, where Daniel and Mrs Doubtfire must both appear at the same time. The action shifts from one side of the restaurant to the other and back again, as Daniel becomes the somewhat intoxicated quick-change artist and elusive dinner guest. In the end Daniel's cover is well and truly blown and Mrs Doubtfire is exposed as a fake. Miranda becomes hysterical and I will never forget the look on her face!

To be able to hang out with his children more often, he decides to crossdress to become an elder woman soon to become the nanny for the children while Miranda is out to work (which Miranda was seeking for). In this movie Robin William was at it best. He really showed what a golden Dad should be.... The last minutes of the movie literally put me to tears. the message in the last scene is very powerful, and convincing. The movie ending was superb as well just about everything else. The kids did a very good job of showing their unique personalities as well as be potent. The only drawback to this movie was the beginning of the movie where Robin Williams was just going overboard as well as the other actors. I just did not connect to the whole movie.

The film was a good-hearted piece of work which tells, with some exaggeration, the universal theme of household strife. It also entails underlining messages mocking the American justice system (rather the workers of) as well as silly madness that is the trappings of a functional normal life. Sure there was some disturbing Freudian crap in there but overall it is all good fun. There was some pretty lewd (or wicked he/she did say) little things there too. Funny that the father-who takes the most risks, makes the wisest cracks (no doubt even kind of funny at times), and certainly the most interesting- it's just rather strange that one who enjoys and knows to enjoy life so much gets branded insane or unstable. The movie, taken at a deeper level, can be seen as parody of how impossible it is to live normal life and maintain a level of creativity and liveliness. William is pretty natural in his acts, most of the supporting actors r pretty good too. If u let go of whatever grudge u have against the world and just follow along, it's not so bad. Due to the perturbing nature of some of the more embarrassing scenes, i rate the movie a well deserved 8/10.

When conversely I attempt to smuggle a Koala out of Australia, by dressing it up as an old woman, get a criminal record?What kind of society do we live in where the good-natured costuming of a marsupial is considered a crime and the evil machinations of Robin Williams twisted mind goes unpunished? Okay. So the koala went berserk and the plane had to make an emergency landing, but does that really make me a criminal? And the Koala was carrying 7kg of cocaine. It was these inaccurate parallels between real life and the sugarcoated world of Hollywood that spoiled this movie for me. Sure, everyday hundreds of fathers get separated from their children for no-good reason, but do they resort to transvestism? Well maybe some do and I'm sure they still love their children, but is that reason enough to make a film about it? Well maybe it is, but how can Hollywood endorse such blatant abuse of a man's right to dress up like a woman? Well it's probably because they'd make a lot of money in the process. I've forgotten what my point is.Anyway, evil Robin Williams does a good job of convincing us that he's a sweet natured Scottish woman, who's like a kind of modern day, old, ugly, non-magical version of Marry Poppins. But don't forget, he's an actor. He's acting like that, concealing his real evil plan of getting access to his children so that he can be with them and watch them grow up. Well Robin Williams, you don't fool me! If I had a Welsh nanny and her breasts caught fire in a hilarious cooking incident I'd be straight onto the police, requesting a SWAT team or an ARV!So here we are. With Robin Williams getting access to his children and me getting taken to court by the RSPCA for feeding cocaine to a koala (as if? Do you know how much that stuff costs? The stupid thing must have thought it was sherbet or something). It seems to me that the law has proven yet again that Hollywood has no idea about the real world, leaving un-trained writers and directors to feed the general public false legal advice.In summary, I'd like to see a film where a female judge (played by Rosie O'Donnell) gets separated from her kids for sending an innocent animal loving man with a yet unproven medical need for cocaine to prison. She'd then see how biased the court system is when she's forced to dress up as a battleship to get access to her kids. And then a crack-addicted koala attacks her, with a machete.

They have kids. Then there are differences, moral or immoral,leading inevitably to a divorce. Such is the fabric of modern American society where the 'happily ever after' theme is slowly but surely giving way to the grim world of courtrooms, settlements and the fight for custody of kids. This is what Mrs. Doubtfire is NOT about. It is also not so much about people as it is about their characters. For its slightly unrealistic but ultimately noble take on a father's love for his kids, Mrs. Doubtfire is justifiably an urban fairy tale. And an american one at that.Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) is a struggling artist who is yet to make it big. His mammoth ego, self-respect & a ubiquitous search for the perfect creative expression often renders him jobless. His wife Miranda(Sally Fields) is more ambitious and successful. But she's unable to deal with her frivolous and obstinate husband, and on a day that was bound to come, calls it quits & Daniel is forced to leave the house. But for all his shortcomings, Daniel simply adores his three kids and they simply cannot do without each other. Miranda soon advertises for a nanny to take care of the children. With his job out of hand & his kids away from his sight Daniel yields to desperation and decides that the only way to be with his kids is to act as a nanny and seize the job. With some Oscar winning help from his cousin Frank (Harvey Fierstein), Daniel Hillard becomes Mrs. Doubtfire, a robust English woman with a funny accent and a love for football. Mrs. Doubtfire becomes and instant hit with Miranda and the kids gradually start liking her. The kids soon discover who Mrs. Doubtfire actually is and to avoid Mama dearest's ire keep it to themselves. Soon 'her' opinion of everything, right from the choice of the T.V. show to the vehement reproach towards Stuart's (Pierce Brosnan) blooming affair with Miranda, is taken heed of. Meanwhile Daniel manages to walk right into a lucrative deal of hosting a sagging T.V. show produced by a hotshot, Jonathan Lundy (Robert Prosky). Just when everything seems to be going Daniel's way, Miranda comes to know of the truth following a hilarious restaurant act.Robin Williams is indescribably good as the father who takes on the garb of an loveable nanny almost overnight. His performance as Mrs. Doubtfire fails words and in fact overshadows the character of the real Daniel Hillard. It would be unfair to ascribe the brilliance of the character to the lards of make-up for it genuinely has a restricted role. Watch 'Big Momma's House' and you'll realise what i mean. It is how Williams performs under the unusual garb that deserves accolades. Not only does he play the role with a convincing element of feminity (that in fact is more genuine than that of the real feminine characters in the film!) but at the same time keeps reminding us that it is Daniel beneath it all and not Robin Williams. His performance hovers on the verge of perfection and he manages to draw sympathy to a father's plight. Few films (and fewer actors) have been able to exhibit such sensitivity of character in a male protagonist. And when the credits roll you know that more than Robin Williams' victory or Daniel's victory it is a father's victory that makes the movie memorable.All said and done Mrs. Doubtfire is a film that is likely to make you laugh and cry both. And if that is not true you simply have to admit that there are few actors (and fewer nannies) as good as Robin Williams.Ten on Ten  "},{"Title":"Excellent","Date":"4 March 2002","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":"  The PlotDaniel Hillard is divorced and wants to see his children more often and so devises a plan to disguise himself as a woman and become Mrs. Doubtfire, an English housekeeper who is better than Daniel himself.The ReviewThe film is long and is not meant for young or sensitive children, but for those who are able to take in the movie will find it enjoyable, funny and an old message that isn't put through well but it gets through.

I have watched this probably over 50 times and each time I love it even more. I refuse to accept the low rating for this film! It is a much-loved classic for everyone! Mrs Doubtfire is about Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) and his struggle in life just so he can see his children. After Daniel and his wife, Miranda (Sally Field) call their relationship quits and get divorced, Daniel finds life a little hard to cope. Especially as he is not permitted by the court to see his three children Lydia, Chris, and Natalie anymore (limited visitation rights), until he gets a good stable job with a steady income, shows he can look after a house, cook, and all the other things men find it difficult to do by themselves. Daniel is desperate and his heart breaks when he cannot see his children whenever he wants. When Miranda places an ad in the newspaper searching for a nanny/housekeeper, Daniel takes action. With a little help from his makeup artist brother, Frank, Daniel becomes Mrs Euphegenia Doubtfire, an elderly Scottish nanny. This is Daniel's struggle to fit in and make it work as a nanny, and sort out his own messy life in the process.I truly love this film. As well as showcasing Robin Williams' finest acting talent it gives out a powerful message about divorce which is important today (check the divorce rates, people!)...AND this movie was made in '93! Go figure.Robin Williams is amazing as Daniel Hillard. This role was made for him and he could not have done it better. The voices, the look, the smile, the whole character in general, screams Robin Williams. His performance is outstanding and there isn't much that I can't say that hasn't been said before. Sally Field is a decent Miranda. She does not match Williams' excellent performance (not that she needs to), but does dish out a good end result. The three children, Chris, Lydia, and Nattie (Matthew Lawrence, Lisa Jakub, and Mara Wilson from 'Matilda' fame) surprise you by playing their characters very well. My favourite was Nattie, the little one, her big eyes and cute little lisp had me Aww-ing my brains out. And yes, Pierce Brosnan does make a cameo as Miranda's new man. He looks very charming and gets away with being the baddie, well he's the baddie in Daniel's eyes! This is a film which is very entertaining and dishes out a very strong message at the same time.

For sadly the drama in the movie only deserves a 3/10 as it is clumsily handled for the most part, and relatively disappointing. Although the narrative does avoid the painfully obvious, it does become weighed down with unnecessary emotional baggage and is too mushy at the end.Still in all it is a very funny feature, benefiting much from the manic Robin Williams (infinitely better in drag than out of it) who creates a real side splitting character out of Mrs. Doubtfire.One can forgive the obvious connection with Tootsie (the two movies would make a great double feature by the way - with the superior Tootsie screening first of course) as even that film was not the first of its kind. Loads of fun if you're willing to sit back, relax and let your sense of humour have a field day.Thursday, December 16, 1993 - Hoyts Cinema Centre Melbourne "},{"Title":"Totally bad!

Robin Williams plays a divorced dad trying to earn a living as a voice-over actor but finding his ex-wife (Sally Field) pushing him away. Williams' solution in the 1990s seems to be the same as Dustin Hoffman's in the 1980s win everyone back while disguised as a woman, a big whirligig of sass and smarts to put everything back on track. As amusing as this is, the plot doesn't have any place to go in the second-half; Mom is dating again, and Dad, incognito as the family's housekeeper, attempts to thwart the romance. It's never made clear if the ex-couple still have feelings for one another. Williams argues with Field with wet eyes and a simpering tone (to tell us he's serious), but she is unmovable with him. It's an automatic downer to see a friendly, appealing actress like Sally Field turned into such a harpy--and not even to advance the plot, she just seems in a perpetual bad mood.

It is as bad as any movie that's ever been hand crafted for a star; you can almost hear the suits sitting around in a board room saying Let's make a movie where we can get Robin Williams to dress up like an old lady, it will be hilarious!But Mrs. Doubtfire just made me sad. It was a real bummer when, for seemingly little reason, Sally Field decided to divorce Robin Williams and turned on him so severely that she didn't even want to let him see his own children for more than one day a week. Why would she do this? She wouldn't, of course, except the script requires her to, because otherwise there'd be no reason for Robin Williams to disguise himself. I know many custody arrangements can be unfair, but why would the judge order this kind of separation based on the details of this divorce? I do understand without these plot contrivances there would be no movie, so it must be that way. But it just made me really upset and made Robin Williams' character seem really pathetic and hopeless. I also hated the Sally Field character so much that I couldn't enjoy the rest of the movie. Overall, it was really sappy when it tried to be sentimental, and really obvious when it tried to be funny (like Robin Williams dancing around with a vacuum cleaner to Aerosmith's Dude Looks Like A Lady--get it? You know, cause he's a man dressed like a woman? Ha ha. Zzzzz.). The one thing I did enjoy about the movie was the final scene in the restaurant, which got a few laughs. It was too little too late though for me. Fans of Robin Williams will think it's really funny, and apparently this movie has its admirers since it has a remarkably high rating here on IMDb.

At the same time, it definitely picked up its concept from the Dustin Hoffman classic, but I sincerely believe it does not attempt to pattern itself on that previous film either. This new entry with a man in a dress has its own story, its own heart tenderly in place, and has a lot of fun in the process. Even though it may not be brilliant like Tootsie, Doubtfire has wonderfully comic moments wrapped up into a heartwarming tale.Robin Williams stars as Daniel Hillard, a gifted voiceover actor who has a unique fondness for his three children, but is unable to hold down a steady job. When his wife Miranda (Sally Field) asks him for a divorce, Daniel is left in an unfortunate situation. Miranda gets sole custody of the children, and Daniel is able to see them every weekend, but he is not satisfied. He therefore asks his brother (Harvey Fierstein), a expert makeup artist, to turn him into a woman. Enter Mrs. Doubtfire, a 60-year old Brit who quickly becomes a housekeeper for the family. Daniel is able to return to his kids' lives full-time, in some form or another.This premise may seem a bit contrived, and may get you wondering how he could fool his ex-wife and kids into the whole scheme. The costuming and makeup looks good on Williams, but is it good enough? This is where Williams adds those comic touches and sugary substance to make Mrs. Doubtfire seem genuine. I truly liked both characters Robin plays, even though I didn't get a total sensation that the two were totally different entities. The film makers ask you to go along with it without too much argument, and as a matter of fact, I did.The movie's real triumph, I believe, is in its realism of divorce and its effect on parents and especially their children. Some may think the film's second act as ludicrous, when Robin Williams tries to chase off Field's new boyfriend, Pierce Brosnan. I don't think it was as much his jealousy over his wife that came into play, but rather being unable to accept another man entering into what was his place in their family structure. Here, you see a quiet nobility in his character, not that we totally dislike Brosnan or consider him a villain, but that we assimilate with Robin's cause. This gives the excessive slapstick and tomfoolery a deeper edge.I think film critics should have a heart when it comes to Mrs. Doubtfire. It does have a certain magic to it that is so hard to find in movies nowadays. I was moved by it, I laughed quite a bit, and overall had a good time. When it comes to entertainment, nothing else really matters. Rating Three stars.

In reality, however, he's just a decent TV actor who can also do cartoon voice dubs. That's why I feel that when someone like me praises a movie of his, it should mean a lot more. Watching Mrs. Doubtfire, I was forced to admire his sheer guts in tackling this Tootsie role (sans roll) despite the huge success Dustin Hoffman already had with it.Most of Robin's film parts amount to a large junkpile of bad remakes, half-written plots and other at least it's a fat paycheck duds. It is also mind boggling how he got an Oscar for his minor foul-mouthed cameo in Good Will Hunting. However, every once in a long while he incredibly rises far above his journeyman talents and rightfully dons the mantle of a true master of the art.He's done five other actually proper acting jobs, which round out an even half dozen when added to Doubtfire. And these few other fine movies are, not surprisingly, parts where he really doesn't play himself Good Morning Vietnam, Hook, Jumangi, Dead Poets Society and Cadillac Man.Well,most actors when their careers are over should consider themselves lucky to even end up with a trilogy of film classics in the can, after doing the usual 25 to 50 major works. Right now Robin's got those six gems, and he still has time to complete a crown of an even dozen. Of course he'd already have that now, if he had just said no when his agent called to ask him if he wanted to do flop-bound flicks like Shlubber, Jerk or Bicentennial Bum.

Hilarity ensues.I know I am in the distinct minority on this one, but when I saw Mrs. Doubtfire I disliked it--and so did my wife. As we both sat in the theater, we heard folks laughing and they seemed to like it. We just felt it was incredibly depressing and not particularly enjoyable. The problem is that for us, combining very broad cross-dressing comedy with a Kramer Versus Kramer plot did not work in the least. Instead of laughing at Williams' exploits, we found ourselves stuck--focusing on the selfishness of the wife and wondering if any SANE person would do what Williams did in order to see his kids (the answer, by the way, is clearly NO). It also came off as a bit creepy. So, you have a selfish wife, a goofy husband and a plot that is utterly ridiculous--and a recipe for a film that we found very hard to like.By the way, I am no Robin Williams fan but he did a good job with the material he was given.

The last film he made that I loved was Patch Adams. I may be somewhat behind the curve since I no longer follow current movies closely, and hardly watch TV at all. Mrs Doubtfire is sort of Tootsie 'light'...Dustin Hoffman's predicament was a tad more believable than that of Robin Williams. And, sad to say, I think Hoffman really had the last word when it comes to comedic farce such as this attempted to be. I found it to be quite boring, and the story line was exceptionally weak...and contradictory. Why should Sally Field break up the marriage because she came home form work and her son was having a birthday party? That's ridiculous...and I have to wonder what kind of Mom would respond in that way to her son's 12th birthday? So what if there was a petting zoo outside and a people zoo inside. It's the kid's birthday, for crying out loud. I just wasn't buying it. Then, for Robin Williams to take the 'Sir Galahad' stance he took when, as a voice over artist, one of the characters puffs away on a stogie...an implausible situation...I cannot think of an animated cartoon...old or current...where a character smokes anything--other than say a pipe for an older character, or a cigar for a gangland type. It may happen with cigarettes, but it certainly is the exception rather than the rule . And this position loses credibility at the end of the film when, at a dinner engagement, Doubtfire insists upon a smoking rather than non-smoking booth in which to dine. The humor is so forced--because the situations are beyond absurd and not likely to occur in the fashion presented--that the wind is taken out of the comedic sails of his passion, and it is so predictable that one can very easily become distracted or indifferent as I did when trying to watch this very difficult to watch film. The lackluster direction of Chris Columbus contributed, no doubt, to the boredom of this celluloid catastrophe. He has no pacing, no comic timing, and it seems that any an opportunity to make this film a true vehicle for the screwball comedy of Robin Williams is wasted because the director did not seize upon opportunities and situations. This Christopher Columbus needs to discover something different...he needs to discover comedy, in all of its variant forms. Williams and Fields are much heralded performers, but their skills and talents are wasted in this feeble attempt. I watched the film once, and I would not want to sit through it again. Nuts to Mrs Doubtfire.

There are just too many things wrong with it. Its only redeeming feature is the fact that it gave Robin Williams a chance to clown around for a while in his standard fashion, but that's it. Sally Fields once again demonstrates that she has, ever since The Flying Nun, displayed all the acting skill of a piece of cardboard. She's great at giving the distressed kitten grimace, and her ability to do this is just now being surpassed by the actress who plays the preacher's wife on the Monday evening sit-com Seventh Heaven.To begin with, the title of the film, and how they arrived at it, is silly.The sight gags (falsies catching on fire, etc., etc.) are amateurish, as are the accompanying lines (  . . . hot flashes . . .  ).What was the point of the air guitar interlude? That was annoying and totally out of place.The costume-changing double-character back-and-forth routine in the restaurant falls completely flat. It has been used many times before, and it never has worked previously, so why did the screenwriter try to get away with it this time? Interspersing that scene with tasteless references to group sex just made it worse. Plus, they could have eliminated most of the alcohol without sacrificing content.The ending is awkward, contrived, and phony. It seems the writer just didn't know how to bring it all to a conclusion, and so he just kind of tied a few loose ends together and went home.Finally, there was in my opinion an incident of totally irresponsible content in the screenplay, that of one of the characters intentionally poisoning a rivals food with an ingredient to which the man is allergic. This should never have been included in the script. This is a personal crusade of mine. To suggest that this act is funny, and suitable material for comic effect, is reprehensible. Food allergies can be killers, and this scene was no better than cinematic inclusions of such slovenly, amoral maneuvers as cruelty to animals or child abuse. It should have been deleted from the script by the review board. "},{"Title":"My kids liked it...

It's just that kind of film- you know what you're going to get, and for people who like that sort of thing, it's great. My big problem with it, though, is that the central premise is Robin Williams being an actor who can do voices. Unfortunately - as great an improviser as he was, and for all his talent and humanity - Robin Williams was not a very good actor. And on top of this, the Scottish accent he does is absolutely appalling. And THEN, we discover that it's not even supposed to be Scottish, as Mrs Doubtfire is English, from England. Marvellous example of 90s Hollywood being wonderfully ignorant of the rest of the universe. Speaking of 90s Hollywood, it must be said that I derived a great deal of pleasure from the wardrobe and set design. I also thought it was a wise choice to make Brosnan's character a decent guy who obviously cared about Sally Field and her kids- would have been far too obvious to make him a greasy villain. Anyway, I really didn't like this film at all. Not just because it was the sort of film I don't like anyway; mainly because of Robin Williams' acting.

This sequence provides us with a development of the character's inner personality, strong morals and consciences. The audience also leans that he is a silly, easy going person. We soon find out it is these characteristics that propel the movie into the first plot point.Daniel's wife, Miranda, wishes to divorce him because he is too goofy and immature. We are propelled quickly into the firm second act after the divorce. Before this point, we have witnessed both actions and dialogue reallocating Daniel's love and compassion for his family, especially his children. The film sets up the for following events using Robin Williams character as the plot advancer.Daniel lusts for time with his children so much, he confidentially disguises himself as a sixty year old woman then applies for a day-care job for his ex-wife--this would allow him to be around his children more often. Miranda falls for it, and the master of disguise gets his opportunity. The film then takes us through a hilarious and emotional journey into the lives of a typical American divorced family.The internal problem becomes more complex when Daniel's ex wife shows romantic interest in a new boyfriend, underplayed by Pierce Brosnan. The filmmakers could have done more with the Brosnan character. Here, he seems developed with repetition and dialogue. Although his purpose is to accommodate romantic competition, we don't know enough about him to care that much.

The guy can't get a normal job so he goes to his gay brother Uncle Frank, and his assistant Aunt Jack, to make him a woman.  Just hearing that line makes me sick. Another gay innuendo in this movie is when they are in the swimming pool complex and Pierce Brosnan is on the diving board and Robin Williams comments What a fine piece of work he is.  Purely revolting.  Also, when he is at the bar in the swimming area and that lady walks up and he says in his male voice Can I buy you a drink?.  That makes me think of an old lady lesbian trying to pick up a young girl.  That messed me up inside.
