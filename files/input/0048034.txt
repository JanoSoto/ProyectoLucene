I had not seen it. I am a great admirer of both the novel and the 1999 film version by Neil Jordan. I count it as one of the greatest love stories in literature.Yes, Van Johnson is miscast as Maurice Bendrix. Still, he is a sincere actor and his work is good considering that Maurice has been Americanized. I wasn't prepared for the devastating performance by Deborah Kerr. Sarah Miles is one of literature's greatest creations. The saint as whore. Or is it the whore as saint? I found myself engrossed and deeply moved watching her. It only confirmed my belief that she was with Vivian Leigh one of the two best English actresses in cinema. I love Julianne Moore in the 1999 version and equally love Deborah Kerr in the 1954 version. Sarah Miles is such a great creation that it would be wonderful to see another filmed version and compare the work of three actresses.Incidentally, The End of the Affair is one of those notable works of literature that went from the page to the screen to the opera house (Jake Heggie, composer -- commission by The Houston Grand Opera -- 2004.) I do like the treatment given to the other characters in the 1954 film version. We get to meet Smythe and the priest and Sarah's mother. In the Neil Jordan screenplay, Smythe and the priest are combined into one character, a Catholic priest named Smythe. Sarah's mother is omitted in that version. If I was disappointed in the 1954 version it has to do with the character of Smythe. His character has a horrible facial birthmark that Sarah kisses when she parts from him. In the novel we are told that the birthmark disappeared upon her death. We have no idea that this happens in the 1954 film version. In the 1999 film version, the birthmark is given to Lance, Parkis's son. Also, in the novel, Lance suffers from stomach disorders. We learn that he is cured of that upon Sarah's death. No mention is made of this disorder in the 1954 film version.Henry Miles, the cuckold, is more tragically portrayed in the 1999 film version. I tip the scales in favor to Stephen Rea whose performance is so true to the gravity of Graham Greene's creation.A great story of human and Divine love with Maurice and Henry fighting for possession of Sarah's soul and only God receives it.

An adulterous affair begun with a certain amount of cynicism on both sides grows into a true and passionate love affair, which in turn raises issues of guilt, trust, duty, self-denial and religious belief. As a story, it holds our interest and causes us to wonder where it will end. As a parable and philosophical meditation on belief and its role in love and contemporary life, it is both stimulating and unexpectedly moving.That a novel as layered and difficult was attempted with major stars at this time is surprising enough. That THE END OF THE AFFAIR succeeds on so many levels seems miraculous, especially in the context of most mainstream film product of the mid-'50s.Van Johnson is not as expressive or deep an actor as the excellent Deborah Kerr and Peter Cushing (and John Mills, Michael Goodliffe and Nora Swinburne) yet his character's relaxed masculinity, reluctant anguish and saturnine, rather malicious jealousy are well-conveyed, and he manages to be a presence you remain interested in. As Greene's Mary Magdalene character, the woman in whom the sacred and profane are mingled, Kerr is terrific in a complex role that is an interesting inversion of her promiscuous, childless woman in the far more famous and popular FROM HERE TO ETERNITY of just two years before. ETERNITY, done for Columbia, the same studio that released this, was far more shallow and conventional in the way it dealt with Kerr's Karen Holmes and her redemption. Just as shallow (and evasive) was TEA AND SYMPATHY, which Kerr did after this, and which received far more fame and attention than was merited. This 1955 version of THE END OF THE AFFAIR deserves to be much better known and remembered, and all concerned deserve belated kudos for attempting such a provocative film in the midst of Hollywood's synthetic movies of the period. I saw this after recording it on TCM, and would like to see it scheduled in prime time, to perhaps begin to get the wider audience it deserves and to hear commentary from moderator Robert Osborn (for that matter, he ought to do one hour interviews with both Kerr and Johnson while they are still around).Let the rediscovery and rehabilitation of this good film begin . . .

So I wanted to warn people that this movie is nothing like that. It is about faith and God.It is couched as a love triangle melodrama. This disguise is so well-wrought that it seems to have fooled a lot of people into thinking the movie is a love story. But all that is merely an excuse for the rather deep philosophical issues that the movie tackles.In typical Greene manner, though, it is rife with unexpected plot twists. For example, just when I thought the movie was about to wrap itself up, it launched into the real reason for its existence, via a flashback into what really happened in Sarah's life. This is an unusual place in a movie to have a long flashback, it seems to me.After this point, there is one change of direction after another. Up until the very last scene, the movie is quite ambiguous, and it is not at all clear whether Greene views belief in God as a bad, destructive thing or not. Even the last scene does not completely resolve this question.Johnson has a particularly unusual part, his all-consuming passion for Sarah inadvertently causing her misfortune after misfortune. His understated guilt and horror each time he discovers the effects of his actions is an interesting part of the story.The acting by the three mains, Kerr, Johnson and, surprisingly, Peter Cushing, is top notch. This movie is not entertainment, however. It is an intellectual challenge, engaging the viewer to wrestle with issues most thinking humans must come to terms with at one time or another in their lives. The dialogues between Johnson and Kerr remind me very much of a non-humorous presentation of the themes dealt with in The Screwtape Letters, with Johnson (and Goodliffe) presenting all the rational, reasonable conclusions favoring atheism, but Kerr inevitably being drawn deeper and deeper into faith in God, more because of their efforts than in spite of them.As has been demonstrated in other comments, this movie will not be enjoyed by those unwilling to examine their stances towards these fundamental issues of human existence.

THE END OF THE AFFAIR was one of the key novels of Graham Greene in the 1950s that delved into his intense Catholicism. With a background of World War II, neighbors Maurice Bendrix and Sarah Miles (Van Johnson and Deborah Kerr) have a deep, passionate romance. But they are separated for a year or so, and when they try to resume the relationship (or when Johnson tries to resume the relationship - Kerr seems relatively hesitant). It turns out that, due to personal experiences, Kerr has had a religious revelation. She is listening to a Catholic priest. She is also trying to help a man with a deformity (a birthmark) on his face who hates God. She is also concerned about the spiritual health of Johnson and of her actual husband Henry (Peter Cushing, in a very moving - and non-horrific role). The film shows how Kerr affects all the lives around her, even beyond her death after a short illness (as the novel does). Yes, it is too talky - novels about ideas (and here it is the age old question of what is real love, the spiritual or the profane)usually are. Greene, good Catholic exponent that he was, would have said that Kerr's devotion to her God was an outpouring of divine true love to her fellow creatures. Her death is not a tragedy. But Greene the novelist and part-time realist cannot leave it there. Johnson's character is bitter at the end of this remarkable novel, and at the end of the film. And his bitterness is directed at the source of that love that triumphed over his profane one.

In fact, Cushing is distinctly superior to Stephen Rea, who played the role of the husband in the 1999 version.   Rea was mopey and morose, but Cushing is a mild man doing the best he can, a picture of unexpected courage -- and frailty.  It's one of the best performances he ever gave; it's a shame it didn't lead to bigger roles.The movie does not, cannot, express the passion so much a part of Neil Jordan's version; furthermore, it's talkier, and the talk isn't as good. It doesn't capture the period (World War II and just after) in the slightest, despite some newsreel footage, but otherwise London is presented very well in handsome black and white photography.   It's an honest and respectable version of Greene's novel, but Jordan's is the classic.

American writer Maurice Bendrix, Van Johnson,had been discharged from the US Army because of a trick knee and decided to spend the rest of the war in London writing a novel about the British civil service system. Meeting the Miles at a party Maurice notices civil servant Henry Miles',Peter Cshing, sexy wife Sarah, Deborah Kerr, smooching with a British Tommy out of the corner of his eye, in a back-room mirror, and feels that she's easy. The first time he's alone with Sarah in a pub, Maurice makes his move on her.Sarah is immediately smitten by the handsome and sweet talking American who's just the opposite of her dull by the books civil service husband Henry. Because Maurice has a very suspicious mind, unlike Henry, his affair with Sarah has a lot of bumps in it. The end comes when he's all alone with her while, like almost during the entire film, Henry is away at work. The Miles house is hit by a German V1 rocked knocking Maurice down a flight of stairs and burying him in the rubble. It's when Maurice miraculously recovers that he notices that the concerned for his life and safety Sarah had completely changed but the reason for her disaffection for Maurice is totally misunderstood by him. That's what leads to the crisis that follows in later driving both lovers to the brink of madness or even death and self-destruction.The movie cleverly has a number of parallel scenes inserted into it where we see what's the real reason behind Sarah's strange behavior, it has to do with her religious beliefs. Sarah is torn between her religion, Catholicism, and her love, while she's married to Henry, for another man Maurice. We also see that Marcice is determined to have Sarah all to himself and that he doesn't care it if would in the end not only kill Sarah but her weak and overly sensitive husband Henry ,who's life without her would be worthless.The ending is a bit too over dramatic even for this schmaltzy tear-jerker with Maurice almost on the brink of an emotional melt-down. He's****MAJOR SPOILER***told by the Miles family doctor that his beloved Sarah's, who at first was only suffering from a very bad cold, condition turned for the worse and with that she suddenly and unexpectedly passed away. It's the guilt of not leaving Maurice and getting on with her life with Henry that seemed to have driven Sarah, unconsciously not willfully, to kill herself! Even though it wouldn't conflict with her religious beliefs and in the end make everything turn out for the better in this three sided wild and forbidden love affair.Somewhat dated but still hits the spot with Deborah Kerr as both beautiful and sexy as ever, even with all her clothes on. Deborah or Sarah does her best and succeeds in showing how it's hard to overcome one's emotions when nature or what turned out to be the man of her dreams, Maurice, takes hold of them. You have to give both Deborah Kerr and her co-star Van Johnson credit in generating enough heat in the theater, or at home of those watching the movie, without having to turn to up the thermostat and thus saving a mint on the energy bill.

Previously he just had a kind of whiny snide voice (Best example of this is in the 1948? 49? film Battleground) I will always love Deborah Kerr, from my POV she can never do any wrong. It is all the better when she was handed a good script and a good director.I would classify this as one of the better scripts. This film is almost like a comedy of errors, instead it is a tragedy of errors. Actually it is quite a sad movie, I would have to read the original book that this was based upon.What attracted me to this film, are the spiritual aspects. If this film were to be remade today, and I see it was remade in 1999, I wonder how much of the spirituality would remain? I have yet to see the newer version. This film is a quest into the reason behind Faith. I can't explain it, but this film makes a lot of sense. Mrs Miles questions to the priest, to the atheist, and to God are all valid.Most people will see this film and will only consider the affair between Johnson's character and Kerr's... But that is not what this film is about at all The affair is just a device author Graham Greene used to tell a story about Faith What it means to have, and what is expected of us who have it.Of course this film has its melodramatic aspects. Also it has Peter Cushing, who is not chasing vampire Christopher Lee for once.The only weak things in this film are the confrontations between Van Johnson and Cushing- If I were Cushing and I had a wife that looked like Kerr I would have punched Johnson in the nose. But maybe the weakness of the encounters were to display that Cushing really did not care about his wife, being more interested in becoming a Lord or some important personage.

However Maurice is plagued with feelings of guilt and jealousy against Henry having Sarah, and bitterness that Sarah is being deceitful to her husband and perhaps, him too.  After a bombing falls near their love nest, Sarah leaves and Maurice assumes that she had wished him dead.  When Henry confides in him about his wife's possible infidelity, Maurice poses as her husband and hires a private detective to follow her and find out what she's doing.I have not seen the remake but was quite interested to see how a 1950's movie would manage to depict the illicit affair between Maurice and Sarah without breaking every moral code of the day.  The answer is &#150; with lots of talking.  The film is significantly shorter than the modern version and had less controversy (or at least, does now) but it still manages to bring things out.  The plot is pretty good but relies very heavily on the extended flashback/journal sequence to keep things going.  The talk heavy feel is a little tiring but does work well &#150; the characters' emotions are brought out well without profanity or nudity.I don't think Johnson fitted the role that well but he was still good.  His inner bitterness and guilt came out well at points and he brings his complex character out well.  Kerr is also good although her role is less difficult.  She does have to carry the whole journal sequence near the end and she doesn't let the film dip.  Cushing only has a few scenes but he is very good.  He gives an English gent performance but eventually you can see the cracks as he tries to hold his feelings together.Overall this is a solid adaptation of the book that manages to bring out the subject matter without the sexual excess of the modern version.  While it is a little heavy on dialogue at times, the emotions come out with all the stilted control of the period and it works quite well as a subversive melodrama.

Of all the Graham Greene work I've seen on the big and small screen this is the most overtly Catholic film I think was ever done.Kerr is married to dull and earnest Peter Cushing and one night at a party during World War II she meets American writer Johnson who after being invalided out of the service stayed on Great Britain. Johnson intrigues and excites Kerr and the two of them are soon in love. Then the guilt starts. Guilt on Kerr's part, jealousy on Johnson's. Poor Cushing for most of the film he hasn't a clue.After the beginning the two can never quite get together. Imagine Johnson who is the paramour hires a private detective to keep track of Kerr's movements to reassure Cushing. This is after things have cooled down. What a pair Johnson has. The detective is John Mills who I'm surprised is taking a small supporting role. He even takes along his young son Christopher Warbey for his surveillance work, the better that his subject doesn't think he's being followed. Besides he's breaking him into the business. The part must have intrigued Mills because he's the best one in the movie.I suppose being a Catholic really helps understand all the subtleties in the story. I much preferred that other affair film Johnson did with Jane Wyman, Miracle In The Rain. No guilt, just people in love.Cushing's character was odd. He was sweet but weak, the kind you feel sorry for. No grand passion was ever to be forthcoming with Kerr or anyone else he would have ever hooked up with.The End Of The Affair is all right. The remake done in 1999 with Ralph Fiennes in the Van Johnson role was more explicit. If you like Graham Greene you'll like both versions.

Still in effect at that time, this is certainly the most explicit treatment of the subject of adultery during the time of the code's strict enforcement from 1935-1955. (Baby Doll released in December, 1956 goes a bit further).While the movie should gets points for its explicit and adult treatment of the subject matter, the film does explicitly preach Catholicism which may be the reason that the theme was allowed. In the 1950's and early 1960's there was a Catholic anthology drama series on U.S. television which often dealt with serious issues like adultery, communism, abusive families, racism, incest, rape and abortion; issues that were almost never raised on television at the time. The show was apparently given a pass because it always ended with one character realizing the issues of his/her ways and having their soul redeemed by joining or rejoining the Catholic Church. This movie reminded me of that show.The movie does have terrific performances by Deborah Kerr, Van Johnson, and Peter Cushing. It should be watched just for the performances. They underplay their roles beautifully and hit emotional high points in just the scenes that need them.Graham Greene is an excellent writer and knows how to keep a plot moving and constantly surprises the audience.One can dismiss this movie as Catholic Propaganda, but the movie is touching, thoughtful and well done. The Catholic Propaganda only mars it slightly, a small price to pay for the pleasure it brings. It is a good affair between two handsome/beautiful people, even if it ends with a bit of repentance and feelings of guilt. "},{"Title":"Just not credible. Would have been better done by Disney.","Date":"11 September 2006","Score":"18 out of 33 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" I'm not sure if I'm writing a spoiler or not. The explanation is vague. I am going to say that the movie is poorly done, so if you don't want to be put off, don't read this critique. But I am not gong to reveal any secrets of the plot.It struck me immediately that Van Johnson was completely wrong for this role. It should have been someone British like Trevor Howard or James Mason or Dirk Bogarde or John Mills. Some actor who could portray completely different kinds of character. Van Johnson was always good old, baby face, Van Johnson. He got the role so as to have a Hollywood glamour boy to sell tickets. The whole beginning of the affair between Johnson's and Kerr's characters is too facile to believe for a second. Johnson meets Kerr only briefly at a large cocktail party where she is hostess flitting from guest to guest. I can't imagine him falling for her on the basis of a few sentences of (very) polite stilted conversation unless she were sensationally alluring which she most certainly was not. In addition, before he leaves the party, he sees her kiss another man (not her husband) through a partly open door. This would only make any normal man think she was a shameful tramp and want nothing to do with her. Who needs the hassle of an affair with a woman who already has a husband and a lover? Please take a number! In addition, if she were to kiss another man in her own home, she's hardly likely to do it in a room with the door open and visible to everyone who enters or leaves the house! But, despite this rapid sequence of most improbable events, lo! He has fallen for her.Then, when they meet in a restaurant, he tells her right away that he saw her kissing another man. Any normal woman would take great offence at being so rudely unmasked but no, Kerr doesn't bat an eyelid. During this very early part of the film Kerr is pretty much a cold fish. She portrays an icy, polite, upper middle class Englishwoman and no American is going to be tempted by a woman like that. Further, I don't see her having any reason to fall for Johnson. He neither says not does anything either intelligent or charming. Kerr and Johnson then proceed to spend lots of time together which is most unlikely to be achievable. Her husband would have to be a complete idiot not to wonder where on earth she was all the time. In addition Johnson is swanning in and out of Kerr's house, sometimes when the husband comes home. Again, in real life, any sane husband would smell a great big rat. When there's something going on between a spouse and another person, and they're in the same room with the other spouse, the other spouse can always tell. They know their spouse too well. The husband is a highly intelligent civil servant and yet is portrayed as a moron who hasn't a clue about what is going on.The story itself is interesting enough and improves as the movie progresses. It poses the usual well known conundrums about God. Having never been religious or Catholic in her life, Kerr, at a moment of crisis, walks in to a Catholic church. In real life that is just not going to happen. Unfortunately, for me, the so called affair is a structure built on sand. There was never any initial foundation of passion between a man and a woman and hence there was never any credible affair. The book is just a convenient vehicle for the stars and that will bring in the fans who want to see Van Johnson in a sob story. My tears are for Graham Greene.

JOHN MILLS does nicely as the detective hired by Johnson to spy on Kerr, adding a bit of much needed humor to the rather dour storyline.Downbeat romance with mismatched stars in the leading roles, it never amounts to much. Someone like DIRK BOGARDE might have been able to be create a more believable portrait than Johnson does and at least provide the missing chemistry with Kerr.

This original is in  the tradition of the time a filmed stage play overlain with noir features. Those noir  elements are humans trapped by fate and an intermediate position of the character (here  both main characters) between audience and character as off screen narrator. In this  original, the all-important diary is just part of that narration.The acting is also of the teapot variety, made obsolete several years before by  `Streetcar.' Johnson and Kerr's careers would plummet as a result.The 1999 remake is an entirely different beast, one more like what Greene intended. This  book was written during the filming of `Third Man.' That film's intent was changed by  Orson Welles and how he approached it. The discussions between Welles and Graham on  reflexive narrative were translated directly into this book.Where the first film is about people and issues of passion versus faith, the second is  about the fabrication of fiction. It is a story about a writer writing itself. Within that story is a woman writing her own  narrative (which Bendrix reads toward the end). Within THAT story is wonder about how  much of both stories are being written by the grand narrator, here played by God... the  well known narrative structure of the `rule of threes,' recreated best in film in `2001,'  which borrows from this.Inserted are shifting observers beyond the 3 writers as observers, again by the rule of  threes the priest, husband and detective. The detective references the original of this  type of literature with Lancelot, whose tale of the archetypical triangle is written -- and  possibly fabricated -- by the god-writer Merlin.You can't get a better concentrated lesson in modern film than seeing these back to  back.In the modern one, Julianne Moore supports the layering, just as she did in the `Psycho'  remake, and the famous layered `Vanya.' The modern one wisely combines the priest  and atheist and introduces the famous ashtray. Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.

It is based on the novel The End of the Affair by Graham Greene.Maurice Bendrix is the clandestine lover of married Briton Sarah Miles. When Maurice disappears during the London blitz, Sarah feels responsible. She thought that if she hadn't been cheating on her husband Henry, Maurice might never have been placed in harm's way. She gets down on her knees and prays, promising to return to her husband and give him up Maurice if her lover's life is spared. The movie is definitely dated by today's standards as it told routine love story wherein everything is clichéd,formulaic and predictable.The performances of the cast saved this from being an average film even during the time it was released.Aside from that,the theme that Greene is trying to convey about morality and his belief in a demanding Catholicism that is not worried about pleasing anyone but God makes this film's message applicable even by today's time.

It's true folks. This was one miserable film.In war ravaged England the two of them begin an affair only for Ms. Kerr to end it in thanks to the Lord when Maurice (Johnson) survives a bombing.The two of them engage in absolute endless talk. The film falls into a discussion regarding the lord and all other kinds of philosophy. Kerr gives an emotionally restrained performance in her usual sing-song diction.As Sarah in this film, there is no great chemical reaction between her and Maurice.As her suffering husband, an English civil servant, Peter Cushing is adequate but the dialogue is ridiculous.John Mills is real dead pan as an investigator.When a husband hires a detective to investigate a cheating wife, that can be believed. When a former lover does this, you have to wonder.Am wondering if Van Johnson was using this film as a pre-test to the much better Miracle in the Rain which occurred the following year. Two deaths coming during rainstorms is more than quite incidental.

The entire picture went around in complete circles along with bombs exploding in London during World War 11. The End of the Affair should have been over before it started, I doubt very much if this couple even enjoyed their so called sexual affair, the both acted way out of character and Van Johnson and Deborah Kerr were not suited for each other as actors in this film. It is a depressing horrible film and it really gave me a Headache to watch.

She is the reason for seeing many of her films. I just checked the IMDB archives, and noticed that she has been Oscar nominated 6 times,( not for  Affair) and has never won...She wasnt nominated for an Affair to Remember either..... somethings wrong....Oscar finally gave her an honorary award... but has never won in competition. Fortunately , The NYFCC, and British Oscars have honored Miss Kerr...and Sally Field has 2 oscars, Luise Rainer has 2, and Ms. Hepburn has 4 !!! I very often feel what a farce our Oscars have become... who's in wins, last yr. it was Julia Roberts, this yr,. i'll bet winner will be Nicole Kidman.. shes in,  shes hot  !!! Well God Bless you Ms. Kerr, wherever you may be hope you are well, and thanks for the many hours of captivating screen performances you have given to us.....  "}]
