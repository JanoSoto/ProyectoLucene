It certainly isn't the best movie ever, but Perry and Hayek both turn in wonderful performances. You can't help but like both of them. You care for the characters. And that is something that is becoming more and more rare in today's movies. The supporting cast does a great job as well, especially Perry's real father and Jill Clayburgh as his parents. It probably is the first time Hayek shows that she is a star and can carry a movie (or at least half of it) on her back. Perry brings a great sense of comedy to the movie. Some of his scenes and lines are laugh-out-loud funny. On top of that, the story is just quirky enough (based on a real-life romance) that the entire situation makes you chuckle.

Since I received it, I found that the overall theme of the movie is learning to love someone else more than yourself. Yes, there are elements of two cultures colliding (and that's not just the Mexican American culture colliding with the WASPs but also a strong theme of east coast versus west coast) but that simply allows the showcasing of some of the best (and funniest) aspects of each.In the end, it is the strong performances by Salma Hayek and Matthew Perry that make the movie so special. The scene where Salma is going to go to the bathroom and Matthew leaves (and is brought back by Salma with her underwear down around her knees) is particularly delightful. I laughed so hard at the scene where Matthew is brought home full of cactus and says Lucy you've got some explaining to do that my wife came in to see if I had hurt myself.All in all a very pleasant experience.

(Note the word 'trying' D ) I can honestly say I enjoyed this movie whole-heartedly, even though it had its not-so-shining moments. I actually decided to watch it because Matthew Perry was in it, but the movie really proved to be great all on its own.The storyline is a pure romantic comedy setup, as other reviewers have noted. It's not exactly the most original plot line. However, certain plot points put a slightly new and different spin on things, and I think these (along with some clever dialogue and great acting and chemistry) save the movie from being totally unoriginal. There were a couple times where I was thrown for a loop, but towards the end, I had pretty much figured out how the movie would end. Well, not EXACTLY how the movie would end, but I had the basic idea. However, the plot progressed in such a way that, even though I knew what was coming, I was still on edge.All in all, a good movie to watch, buy, or rent.

The beginning seems unreal and foolish (something like Britney Spears marrying her childhood sweetheart in Vegas only to annul it the next day). Basically, its boy meets girl in restaurant, both had a one night stand, girl disappeared next morning, only to come back to boy 3 months later to tell him that she is pregnant with his child. Girl brings boy back to meet her family, boy decided to marry her in Vegas with Elvis Presley as witness. I don't know if anyone would really do something like that in the real world, without making sure that the girl is really pregnant with your kid and not someone else's, or worse - marrying a total stranger. Story goes on with boy not telling his wife that he is from New York and will be moving back there when his construction project ends, and also lied to her about his parents being in Europe and therefore couldn't tell his folks that they got married. So the wife got upset and mad, pretended to have a miscarriage and left him to go back to Mexico. But the ending was really sweet and you'll wish your husband can be as sweet as Matthew Perry (who discovered he had married his wife not because she was pregnant but because he loved her, and had to navigate his way to central Mexico/Vegas/Hoover Dam to win his wife back).

This, obviously, has its setbacks. One night you are just not in the mood, and you write a film off as trash; another night, in a more favourable frame of mind, you lap up a film just loving it. This is of course pre-emptive and subjective but we are all human. We all have our foibles and manias. So if you forgive me for dismissing out of hand all those delightfully dreadful romantic comedies with Richard Gere or Hugh Grant, whoever the delicious young lady may be playing with them, without forgetting Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, as being pure unadulterated slush, we might meet on level terms and wade in where fools fear to tread.I just love Salma Hayek. She is not only superbly gorgeous to look at - those deep Mexican-Lebanese eyes just keep you enchanted throughout - but she is also pretty good at acting. That, together with a nicely-told story with intelligent directing and dialogues which do not fall flat on their face helps make `Fools Rush in' stand out above the rest of the ilk. Firstly the film does not try to be sickly funny. It does not make ireful bile rise into your throat. Perhaps Matthew Perry is not the exact partner for the role, but the chemistry between him and Salma Hayek seems to hold together fairly well. The story is also an indictment into situations which must be arising daily especially in the United States of America where racial intolerance can become highly murky. A white New-Yorker falls in love with a Mexican girl. Well, if they are all like Salma Hayek, I would not be at all surprised. I would, too. But sociological barriers - in the Mexican family also, with a wonderful interpretation here by Angelina Calderón Torres - produce the logical but hypocritical obstacles which still persist in what for me should be classified as erstwhile societies.A film I shall see again, which for me must be unique among films called romantic comedies. But there is just that something in the petite thirty-year-old Salma Hayek which lifts me heart and soul into clouds of surrealistic fantasy, that has me fascinated, enchanted.Therefore any objective commenting on this film is out of the question for me.

It's not exactly a new premise, but the chemistry, acting, and comedic talents of Salma Hayek, Matthew Perry, and a strong supporting cast make this among the better of romantic dramedies.Isabel (Hayek) is a working class Latin, Alex (Perry) is a rich New Yorker. They meet in Vegas, and as the title suggests, rush in to a Vegas quickie wedding complete with Elvis. Then the culture clash sparks begin.However, what could be a tiresome cliché-fest of stereotyping, quickly develops into a pleasing character study of the leads and their respective families. Isabel's father at first acts erratically, almost as a comic relief, but the story properly elevates him to be a very strong, sympathetic, and positive character. Many of the other supporting characters are very likable, as well. Alex's elitist parents are more of an obstacle, and provide some interesting conflict.It would be easy to dismiss this story as a typical love conquers all routine, but much more happens than that. I love the symbolism of such landmarks as the Grand Canyon, Hoover Dam (including the state line located there), New York, Las Vegas and how they are used in the story. In the case of Vegas, the music of entertainers associated with it is integrated well into the emotional moments. Isabel's flight to her grandmother's house is an endearing sequence, and the Donka Schoen scene was very touching. You really feel for the lover who gets rejected in the latter.Perfect date movie; highly recommended.

For example, when you meet the family it is not just three or four people it is half the town. Also when you sit in the sun all day, some people tend to melt (I do) and others do not. In the movie, I also found her father's line Presbyterian is not a religion a nice summary of why the parents didn't think the marriage could work.The movie has nice scenery of the grand canyon, the hoover dam, the desert and the great grandmother's Mexican casa. The surround sound is very enjoyable. It includes a great many songs all of which blend in nicely with the movie. The Elvis songs near the end of the movie are quite touching.Finally the two leads are sensational. Matthew Perry's body language is superb for the kind of light comedy role he plays. He also did the emotional stuff really well. Although not quite certain about his feelings, his heart pulled him head-first into marriage.Salma is very cute and her tan does her wonders.

That's what's going through Alex Whitman's (Matthew Perry) head when he has a one-night stand with a Spanish beauty (Salma Hayek) during a construction project in Sin City. Little does he know, his one wild night results in big consequences, something that only happens in a select few Hollywood movies. (Most illustrate only the pure fun and spontaneity of having sex with strangers.) Isabel Fuentes shows up on Alex's doorstep three months afterward and announces that she is pregnant. She doesn't insist on child support or that Alex even be a part of the child's life. She only wants Alex to know solely for knowing, since it is the right thing to do. But Alex has a different plan in mind. Shocked by the news, he follows Isabel and the two impulsively decide to get married. Cultures and ideas clash as they soon learn.Don't miss out on this great movie. It qualifies as a chick flick, but has genuine humor and beautiful people as well.

Fools Rush In, however, is anti-stereo- typical in a number of ways.The movie concerns a one-night stand between a beautiful Latina photographer and an upwardly mobile young businessman from New York.  They meet in Las Vegas, and the movie details the relationship that develops between them, since the one-night stand results in her pregnancy.On one level, this is the story of what happens when two individuals with scarcely an idea of serious love and commitment are confronted with a relationship, in the pregnancy, that is more than they bargained for.  That is not so unusual.  There are many unplanned pregnancies that occur in the world.  What is unusual is the way in which the movie handles this fairly conventional situation and the many unconventional issues it brings up.The reversal of stereotypes begins when Isabel arrives at Alex's house and tells him she plans to keep her baby.  This is after he tells her that he is pro-choice.  When most people today say pro-choice, they usually mean allowing for clinical abortion.  They don't mean I plan to keep this baby.  Yet, this latter choice is also pro-choice.  This is just one of the ways in which this movie challenges the conventional stereo- types of our time.There is another important way in which Fools Rush In challenges stereotypical thinking.  It presents, as a very serious and viable option, the possibility of an intercultural or even interracial marriage.  That isa topic which may still disturb some people, but which should becomemore accepted if we are really serious about welcoming a multicultural world and an end to racism.The movie uses the Grand Canyon and its environment as a metaphor for this and I believe that the attitudes of Isabel's and Alex's family to their budding relationship are exaggerated for this reason  a kind of culture shock.  I don't think the movie's director is interested in perpetuating conventional stereotypes.Fools Rush In is charming and truly romantic because it shows how Isabel and Alex--against long-standing cultural opposition and even their own expectations--are inexorably, metaphysically drawn to spend the rest of their lives in love together.This is an exceptionally strong role for Salma Hayek.  She displays a kind of relational integrity in the role of Isabel that is independent of her supposed sex symbol status.  She takes control in this movie.  Of course, the attitudes and reactions of the other characters are credible, even if slightly caricatured.In summary, Fools Rush In is nothing to rave about, but it is rare enough to award three stars.  It is well worth watching!

It is about not being truly happy with your life, and when you discover what you want, being willing to make the sacrifices necessary to keep it. One of these is overcoming your fears. This is what Alex Whitman (Matthew Perry), and photographer Isabel Fuentes (Salma Hayak), have to do throughout the film. One big issue is the families involved Alex's are blue blood WASP types, and Isabel's are very traditional Mexicans. It is also Alex's story (far more than Isabel's), and how he really does not like his life, he just does not know any other way. One thing he does, is instead of joining the Country Club set, is studying architecture, at Yale. While going to Yale, is expected for someone like him, taking a difficult major outside the family business was not. So was marrying Cathy Stewart (Suzanne Snyder), who to quote Alex Was pursuing me since the 3rd Grade. Since the Stewart's were good friends of his parent's (John Bennett Perry (Matthew's real life father) and Jill Clayburgh), it would have been the easy thing simply to marry her, and please them (Although he finds it difficult to stand up to them (Which will create problems later on)). Spoilers Ahead He and his best friend Jeff (Jon Tenny) are transferred From the New York office where they work, to Las Vegas for a construction project. He then meets Isabel in a Mexican Restaurant and lets her cut the line to the bathroom, and from there they have a one night stand, and then she disappears. Month's later, she shows up pregnant, and he offers to meet her family, so she would not be shamed into being pregnant with someone they never met. When he does, he really likes the big family environment and comments on how his family never eats together. He then offers to any marry her, and he is happy with her, until his parent's show up, and he cannot admit to them Isabel is his wife. From there, the relationship starts to sour, because of family issues, mistrust, lies (She told him she had an miscarriage), and their fears. In one scene Isabel goes to Mexico to visit her great grandmother, and admitted how much she loved Alex, but was afraid of being hurt. They finally agree to get a divorce, but Alex (Now back in New York) is miserable. He runs into a Priest, who tells him There are signs out there. Pictures of The Grand Canyon, a chihuahua, and a little girl named Isabel, remind him of her, and he does not want the divorce (Although time is running out). So he goes down to Mexico (Where he found out she was), and takes a cheap plane from Mexico City, an old bus, and a mule, to get to her great grandmother's only to find out she was heading back to Las Vegas (He had no idea it was to bear his child, since he did not speak or understand Spanish). He gets there first, and is standing on Hoover Dam, and a huge rainstorm happens and he gets drenched. Finally she is driving and sees him and almost causes an accident. She is mad at him (And more at herself because she lost hope (She broke up with a previous boy friend because a necklace broke which to her was a sign)), then he finds out she is still pregnant, and they both admit they were lying and afraid. Then her water broke, and she is going to have the baby right on the Dam. What really impresses her, is the fact that he would travel all the way to Mexico just for her (He had no idea she was still pregnant). When the baby comes (A girl), Isabel asks Do you think she will like living in New York City?' Alex says Not as much as camping in the desert. A key point, because one of Isabel's brother's explained, that her life is here, and she would not be happy anywhere else. Then Isabel said With a few Gray's Papaya hot dogs (A famous New York hot dog). Alex then says, Oh no. Isabel says' What? Alex says We're divorced. Of course, that will change when they are married again (This time in a traditional way at The Grand Canyon (Unlike the first time by an Elvis impersonator and without the families there)). I am a huge Salma fan, and she is at her best here. But this is Perry's film, and his scenes are the funny ones Getting cactus needles in his behind after going camping and landing in a pit of rattlesnakes, and the rain scene. But he is also the one who is willing to do whatever is necessary to have Isabel, and that means leaving his prior life behind, and not only accepting but embracing hers. This is one of my favorite films of all-time. 10/10 stars.

As the assignment will last a few months, Alex is less than enthusiastic but makes the trip. Things begin to look up, however, when he meets beautiful Isabel (Salma Hayek), a photographer, in a trendy bar. They are instantly smitten with one another and the result is a hot one night stand. In the morning, Isabel sneaks away with no forwarding address, perhaps because of a touch of shame. However, a month or so later, she comes once again to Alex's condo to announce that she is pregnant and that, yes, Alex is the father. Alex is thrown for a loop, especially since Isabel is adamant about having the baby. Casting caution to the wind, Alex decides to marry the lovely Isabel on the spot. But, there are complications. Isabel is a Mexican-American with a Catholic family who is terribly upset that the marriage did not take place at a church. As for Alex's parents, they are whitebread, uppercrust America and they are equally appalled at their son's choice. Then, too, Isabel loves the desert Southwest but Alex can only imagine living in the Big Apple for the rest of his life. Will they be able to survive their first year? This is a very funny, very romantic film about unlikely marriage partners. Perry is a talented comedian whose humorous delivery is priceless, especially in this movie. Hayek, although known more for more serious roles, does a nicely comic turn here, too, and she is utterly gorgeous. The rest of the cast, including Jill Clayburgh and Jon Tenney, are very good as well. Then, too, the scenery in Nevada is of the put-your-eye-out variety and the costumes, script, and production values are sharp, also. If you are a fan of romantic comedy, you should definitely rush out to see this one as soon as possible. It is worthy of many a top ten list. But, even if romcoms are not your cup of tea, this one will charm you with its funny situations and delivery. You will not be foolish at all to give it a try.

It has the heart that 'The Whole Nine Yards' lacked, and the seriousness that I felt oh-so-deprived of in 'Three to Tango'. And, you know, it wasn't 'Serving Sara' at all (thank God).This is your basic guy-meets-girl, she asks to go pee, they have a one night fling, she ends up pregnant, they get married by Elvis, you know...the whole shebang (and I promise I'll never say that again). But what I like about this film is that the characters aren't perfect. They aren't predictable, and they aren't wonderfully wholesome people.Isabel (Salma Hayek) is blindly led by her faith and nearly lets her almost God-fearing beliefs lead her life. Basically, if this chick got a sign that she should kill you, I'd be running.Alex (Matthew Perry) is almost the anti-Isabel, but not quite, for that would be clichéd, and this movie is anything but. Addicted to work, Alex cannot seem to comprehend that there might be something more to life.Towards the end of this film, Isabel, the once guiding force in their relationship, has given up on it, and Alex, the work-a-holic, is willing to throw the order of his life aside for the feisty Latina. Despite coming from different cultures and leading different lives, these two characters are made for each other.With some excellent dramatic acting from Perry (gasp) and Hayek, I think this film will leave you on edge, unless you've read this review, in which I tell you a very happy ending occurs.7, for being complicated, without losing its simplicity (which is the simple message that love conquers all.

Ms Hayek has never looked or sounded more sincere/stunning, pointedly revealing Ed Norton's silly peccadillo(s).For a movie about `rushing in where angels fear to tread' -marriage- to work, the leads needed chemistry. To this reviewer Perry&Hayek still smoulder after any number of viewings. Moreover, the supporting cast is a finely tuned ensemble who obviously workshopped the characters to give FRI(1997) a definite pilot feel.Perry's Alex Whitman is welcome as a more fleshed-out Chandler Bing; a Metrosexual New Yorker still looking for a `dare to be great' romantic situation, on location at Las Vegas for his nightclub-building firm. His best friend Jeff (Jon Tenney) is a professional sleazebag, and trying to weed out Alex's conscience. When the sleaze foists him onto their toy-boy-hungry colleague, Alex deflects her back with `-Well then, they should be looking into Jeff, because he heads up our..pants down..department..'He's equally perceptive but vulnerable after he hears from his beautiful one-night-stand that he's going to be a father. He realises that even though he seems like an upstanding guy to Isabel (Salma Hayek), her family will still hate him. To her credit, she instantly reassures him that she `won't let them', an expression of the torch she already carries for him. And although we don't see nearly enough of her inner turmoil, we can accept that by the time they steal that kiss, she pretty much loves him; otherwise she'd never let him talk her into a Vegas quickie.For his part, Alex argues with Jeff that `dating is stupid', justifying his sudden decision to marry `The Body'. He half-nails Jeff as being `just p!ssed that I won (the gamble of relationships) on the first pull instead of putting in quarters into the wrong machine for the last 5yrs' `You knocked her UP?!' goggles Jeff. `Well, YE-ES,..but that had nothing to DO with it!!'Romance notwithstanding, Alex is torn by reality checks over family and identity. He realises his sense of belonging has something to do with the rest of his life, but exacerbating his culture shock, his Mexican beauty comes with a Mexican family the size of a small village. She's got half a dozen burly brothers and a jilted fiancee called Chuy (`Choo-ee'). Upon their first tense meeting, Alex greets him with `Chewie! Hi! Luke Skywalker, how are 'ya?..sorry, you probably get..that a lot..'Although telegraphed, Alex's blossoming is handled very sensitively. The young couple observe each other probably for the first time at the Fuentes' dinner party, and their stolen kiss lends raw emotion to Perry's nervous reaction.Unfortunately, Alex proves to be immaturely squeamish about biology, and only mostly harmless. During their worst fight, his betrayal is devastating to the honestly trying Isabel `I've worked my entire life for an opportunity like this, and I'm not giving it up because one night I put a $5 ring on your finger in front of Elvis as a witness'! Yet to his credit, he's also been avoiding the matrimonial advances of a WASP acquaintance `since third grade'.Matthew `wrote the book' on the quipping fish-out-of-water-gentle/smart-guy; and were he to abandon the guise, we'd miss it terribly. Alex Whitman/ Chandler Bing are Perry's `I Am Spock' manifesto.Perry's physical comedy even gets Alex a buttful of cactus as the newlywed goes hunting with Isabel's brothers. He's carried home anaesthetised to the gills on tequila, and still requires an inflatable cushion when his parents show up unannounced. His squirming denials are deflated by his final introduction of his wife as `Mom, dad, I have some interesting and..exciting..news'.His fear of his alienated parents' reaction is symbolic of Alex's identity crisis. To our amusement, they turn out to be every bit the embarrassing stereotypes he had dreaded, although Jill Clayburgh pushes the mother's broadness past actual humour. Alex's dad is more believable in the hands of Matthew's actor father John Perry.More serious questions about carving out a life as it roars ahead with or without you, especially with a baby, are aptly levelled at the rat-race. We have to watch an otherwise happy marriage unravel as a husband compartmentalises his life/wife. Isabel correctly guesses he's keeping his business stress from her; while Alex begins to see her as an impediment to his brass ring--instead of its embodiment. It IS a question of identity and culture, but he's pegged himself to the wrong brass ring. He doesn't yet realise that in 10yrs he'll be asking himself if being at the top of his game is all there is, and in reply perhaps himself degenerate into `Jeff the Sleazebag'.FRI(1997) is therefore even more observant than Jerry Maguire(1996) or She's The One(1996), because it acknowledges the rich tapestry of family relationships and self-perception as a fundamental (but subconscious) motivator of mistakes.Perhaps that's what's debilitating Ed, too.Siobhan Fallon (from Men In Black(1997)) is wonderfully sardonic/trite in these small doses as Lainie, Isabel's roommate and Alex's only link to his wife during their many fights.However it's the romantic feistiness of Hayek's Isabel that really drives our commitment to the story. She is still naïve enough to reorganise her life for what she thought were `signs', but is as pragmatic about their future as Alex is terrified.The Vegas setting is gracefully enhanced by an economical indulgence of Elvis (`Jailhouse Rock', `It's Now Or Never', `I Can't Help Falling in Love With You'), Latin tunes, and strategic uses of Dean Martin's `Ain't That a Kick in the Head' and Wayne Newton's Ferris Bueller-reminiscent `Danke Schoen'.Full marks to Juel Bestrop for casting, writers Katherine Reback & Joan Taylor; Chuck Southcott for obtaining the rights to the soundtrack, and director Andy Tennant. There are `signs' of their consummate touches `everywhere'.FRI(1997) is as perceptive as Penny Serenade(1941) without the sentimentality. You pine for the final scene to come true, because it's Elvis singing it from the heart--and he's 2nd To None.(10/10) "},{"Title":"Suprisingly entertaining romance.","Date":"2 September 2003","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Whether or not you are a fan of Matthew Perry's schtick, a la Chandler from Friends, you can hardly help but empathize with his character Alex in this charming, romantic film.

The vehicle isn't for Perry, it's for Chandler, and in my opinion, he is the most annoying one from that series.So thank heavens for Hayek, who shows here that she isn't just beautiful, but she can carry a film and make it that little more interesting when shes on screen.The story is amiable enough and quite sweet, but it's nothing we haven't seen before, and we will see plenty of them again.It's pretty forgettable stuff, which is a shame, because Hayek is great..

In all fairness it was a pretty good genre movie that works on both its drama and comedy levels.It's a good genre movie, that is definitely better than your average romantic-comedy movie from the '90's and 2000's. Guess people's biggest beef with the movie is that it has Matthew Perry in it. People always have had a hard time seeing him in role different from his Chandler role in Friends. And in all fairness, yes Matthew Perry really wasn't this movie strongest point. He approaches the character from a comical interval pretty much in the same way as his Chandler. The way he delivers his dialog, the way he moves, the way he looks through his eyes. It shows how limited his qualities as a comical actor really are. Good enough for his Chandler role but not for much else really I'm afraid. On top of that, it's really hard to believe that a woman such as Salma Hayek would actually really fall for a this sort of guy. Not the greatest screen chemistry but the director did a good job at filming around this, to still make the movie believable and likable enough.Selma Hayek on the other hand was surprisingly great in her role. She normally doesn't do this romantic-comedy type of movies but I think this movie shows that she has got talent for it. As an actress she's perhaps a bit of an underrated and underrated person, though no people ever questioned her looks. She's so much more than just a great body and a pretty face. The movie further more also features a capable cast, that obviously feels at ease in the comedy genre.The directing is refreshing and provides the movie with its own unique look and identity and the right required pace. Seems like the movie-makers really didn't wanted this movie to be just another formulaic genre piece. Comicaly the movie also works out with some good moments but the movie is also a well balanced mix of its comedy and the more serious and dramatic approach of things.The story begins quite good and sweet but also definitely original. Too bad that in the last halve hour or so the movie still turns into a formulaic typical genre piece, when the movie starts to fall from the one cliché into another. The approach at first was good and the movie was mostly done in a non-formulaic way. It makes it all the more a shame that the last part of the movie somewhat downgrades the movie by its more predictable and generic elements and approach of it.

Matthew Perry is a very talented comic actor, and he's hysterical on Friends as the sarcastic Chandler Bing.  The movie was released shortly after he became popular on the show.  His sarcastic schtick works great in sitcoms, but in this movie it gets jarring at times.  There are some moments that don't require any comic relief, and he breaks the moment with his broad sarcasm.  The story is slightly predictable, with every mishap you would expect in a comedy of this type--the parents of each family dislike each other, the girls leaves him towards the end, we're faced with the typical climax of him chasing after her.  But I did enjoy the way the film used the theme of fate.  Though it may seem a little far-fetched that our main character meets his future love interest on the line to the bathroom in a Mexican restaurant and it's love at first sight, I'm sure many relationships do start out that way.  Fate works in mysterious ways.  Salma Hayek has never looked more beautiful, in her first starring role--her past roles being brief appearances in films like From Dusk Till Dawn and Fair Game--and she shows great charisma.  There are some funny moments, mostly due to Perry's routines--though he sometimes fails, assuming that he's still on a sitcom set.  It's pretty nifty that his real-life father, John Bennett Perry, is casted as his character's father.  There are too many films where the parents don't look a thing like their sons or daughters, and it wasn't the case this time around and naturally the chemistry was already there. Fools Rush In is a good film to watch on a lonely night, and it's bound to put a smile on your face.

The delightful script is an updated version of the ancient, classical comedy, which always ends in a marriage that unites and corrects the flaws and foolishness of intially, objecting families, and there by, nourishes society's perpetuation, through supportive and loving family. The hero, Alex, faces situations where he has been unsuccessfully pursued, first by the family approved, country club, American WASP princess, and later by the wicked adulteress, so we can see that his committment to Isabel, the Mexican American photographer, is sincere.  The genuineness of Alex character is clevely off set by his jaded pal, just as is Isable's in her parallel circumstance.  Equally, classically balanced situations exist with their families, who all fear for their respective cultures' survival, and even in the lovers' own blind insistence on career locations that prevent true marriage. As the lovers compromise and mature in their relationship, it grows from its initial, strong attraction, to where they finally embrace each other's interests and convictions.  They can then re-unite in a second marriage, surrounded and ensorsed by family and friends. The casting and performances are a 10, all around.  Hayek and Perry are so convincing as Isabel and Alex that they create the belief in their existence beyond the film's ending.  Tenney is especially effective as the cynical and necessary opposite of Perry's Alex.  Certainly, all of the cast is strong and a vital contribution to the success of the film.  On another note (ooh, pardon the pun,) the music is a fabulous aspect of the film.

It was different from many of it's peers in the romantic comedy genre, as its story-line was very original.  I enjoyed its multi-cultural themes and its homage to it's own filmatic heritage.  As a Rom-com buff, I would put it very high on my favorites list, as the acting is good, the plot plausible and the production is effective.  It's no Ingmar Bergman, but it holds its own in a medium dominated by no-brainer action films. Besides, an Ingmar Bergman film isn't what you watch for easy viewing!!!

This film is never going to be very popular with those non- Friends fans, but it does have a lot to offer everyone, with a clever and funny script, the scene between Perry and Hayek as she goes to the toilet is a gem, and wonderful performances from all concerned, especially the parents of the central characters (including Perry's real life father).

I will admit to being a viewer of Friends and therefore, because of so identifying Perry with the great Chandler Bing, did not expect too much from Matthew Perry in another role.  However, I was surprised by his charm, as Alex Whitman, a WASP stuffed shirt, even when obscured by his ambitiousness and awkwardness. Salma Hayek, as Isabel Fuentes, was terrific, too, and did not seem to fall into the stereotypes that actors of other nationalities are sometimes subjected to.  She was simply a Mexican American woman, complete with goals and ideals, like any person.  Alex and Isabel are sweet, even through the poignant middle of the movie, when culture clashes and the threat of what haste can bring, becomes sometimes depressing.  Okay, so it will never be When Harry Met Sally or any of the really successful romance films, but it was engaging.  The chemistry of both Perry and Hayek had much to do with it.

Matthew Perry and Salma Hayek meet on a job location and strike up a friendship that leads to a one night stand but she is gone by morning. He is from Manhattan but his job is in Vegas. Eventually she resurfaces with the news that she is pregnant. They decide to marry but they are from different cultures. It also doesn't help that her father takes an immediate dislike to him. Fine setup with realistic story structure but the religious elements are offensive. Hanging a cross in your home does not protect anyone from evil spirits. Directed by Andy Tennant who made the xeroxed Parent Trap crap fest It Takes Two so he couldn't do too much worse than that. Thankfully he improves and goes for intelligence. Perry fabulous as a confused guy who wishes to take responsibility. Hayek is terrific as a woman locked into particular values. We know where their relationship is headed and the supporting roles are no help. They are your usual brand of stereotypes who will be won over but not before they advertize lame religious beliefs.

Basically New York construction supervisor Alex Whitman (Matthew Perry) and Mexican photographer Isabel Fuentes (Salma Hayek) have a chance meeting while in a Las Vegas Mexican restaurant queue for the toilet. They find themselves in bed together, and they part ways without seeing or hearing from each other for three months, until Isabel comes to find Alex. She tells him that she is pregnant, even though it was a one night stand and he used a condom, which was ineffective, but she is and she wants to keep the baby. Isabel thinks it is a good idea for Alex to meet the family before she tells them the truth, so she invites Alex to a big family get together dinner, where father Tomas (Tomas Milian) is a little bit sniffy about her boyfriend. Together they decide that it is a good idea to stay together, so in a Vegas chapel, with an Elvis Presley impersonator they get married, and they do actually get on as a growing couple. Of course the whole relationship has its problems relating to living locations and clashing of cultures, so there is the point when they argue and part ways again. But don't worry, Alex and Isabel find each other again on a rainy night on the road, and that is where their baby girl is born, and in the end they have a real wedding on a canyon, with the Elvis song Can't Help Falling In Love playing, which features the lyric only fools rush in. Also starring Jon Tenney as Jeff, Carlos Gómez as Chuy, Men in Black's Siobhan Fallon as Lanie, John Bennett Perry (Matthew's real father) as Richard Whitman and Stanley DeSantis as Judd Marshall. Perry is actually quite appealing, less sarcastic than Chandler, and Hayek is sexy and fun, it may be predictable quite a lot of the time and questionable in logic, but not a bad romantic comedy. Worth watching!

Had it been released today in the year 2010 it may have been considered the savior of the rom-com genre. As bad as the movie is the ultimate fate of the romantic comedy was worse.The movie misses on almost every level- it was miscast, had few laughs and only paid lip service to the supposed underlying higher theme of the hand Fate has in our lives. Our female and male leads are pros and do what they can to rise above this mess but we can only expect so much. The movie has cute moments as well including a race relation analogy utilizing squirrels. Despite that and the charms of the individual leads there isn't enough chemistry present to make it work. It stays fairly true to established romcom blueprints, but the movie misses on some real opportunities like a scene featuring Matthew Perry's character finally getting the approval of the father.The real star of the movie is Las Vegas itself. Shown here is a softer, less known side of Vegas in breathtaking panoramic shots, far from the lights and showgirls, and if the film succeeds anywhere it's in it's ability to immerse and intoxicate the audience with the visuals. Against that backdrop we are treated to a glimpse of a Mexican American family that has a very genuine feel to it. If you mourn the death of the Romantic Comedy and you've exhausted the finer examples of the genre then maybe this one is worth a gamble. Oh yeah Salma Hayek is in it. =) "},{"Title":"Don't rush into watching","Date":"3 October 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" I caught this on television with my girlfriend, having no expectations coming in. In almost every aspect, this is a competent and well-made movie. However, nobody involved seems to have had much of an interest in making anything beyond a competent and well-made movie. It's essentially a paint-by-numbers entry into the romantic comedy genre that doesn't have enough blood in the comedy or in the romance to be very memorable or involving beyond casual TV viewing.Matthew Perry and Salma Hayek are the leads. I can understand why they were cast (Perry for his sitcom fame, Hayek for her good looks), but neither one really impresses me as a very good actor -- Perry mainly stand around looking helpless and conflicted and moves his arms in random directions when he speaks, and Hayek comes up with some line readings that make me wonder whether she bothered to read the script.The plot, which is a not-too-imaginative variation on a ubiquitous one that plays pretty heavily on stereotypes of Mexicans and rich people from Connecticut (a rich man from Connecticut gets a Mexican woman pregnant, then decides to marry her for love, but runs into complications with their respective goals, families, and customs), is time-tested, solid, and has a lot of opportunity for good drama, but that opportunity is mainly squandered -- we don't really get to follow HOW the two protagonists get over their differences and earn their happy ending.This movie seems to serve up its romance with a generous side of it's-good-to-believe-in-signs, which as a non-superstitious viewer I did not really buy, but it's easily ignored for the character device it is.That said, there are some amusing moments, and there are some sweet moments -- just fitting the requirements for the genre the film is a product of. It's a perfectly adequate date movie or television time-killer if you're in the mood for it (most movie viewers will be able to read a short description and know just what to expect), but don't go in looking for anything special.

There are a few things in it that I loved a lot, and a few others that I could not stand.This is what I loved1) Salma Hayek's physical presence. A guy wrote that she has the face of an angel and a body to kill for. I agree one hundred percent. In this movie, she is absolutely gorgeous, sweet, sensual, determined, and passionate at the same time. And guys, this is a devastating combination in a woman.2) A few scenes in the flick, especially the final wedding ceremony in the desert at the rhythm of Can't help falling in love by Elvis. I do not know exactly why, but I find it hopelessly sweet and romantic. It is only one minute, but I would recommend the movie for that scene alone. I also liked Salma Hayek's dance in the kitchen (how could I not?). Finally, I liked the scene when Matthew Perry holds the baby. The way Salma Hayek looks at Matthew Perry during those moments is so full of feminine romantic tension that it makes you understand the magic of marriage in less than five seconds.This is what I did not like1) Matthew Perry's character. Alex was a weak man; actually, he was still a boy, like those guys of Friends. He was too modernly confused a man for me to like him. Maybe the men of these two last decades are like that, but I do not like it. Yes, he was man enough to marry her when he found out she was pregnant, and he was a nice guy, but he was not a man. The way he lied to Isabel about his parents being in Europe, or the fact that he did not share his problems at work with her made me sick. All in all, I could not like the male character that much. In their marriage, Isabel was the one who wore the pants and worried about holding their relationship together (which is typical in   a catholic marriage). I simply could not stand that.2) The reason the brings Alex back to Isabel is stupid. The movie hits home by showing all the difficulties of a marriage between two people from different backgrounds, but at the end it screws up everything by having Alex go back to Isabel based on what? Signs!!! How can the guy hope to navigate through all the problems of a marriage if he bases his decision on a sign representing the Nevada desert, a dog, and a little girl named Isabel?

Their cultures collide, however when the parents meet each other.  I did not like Isabel's father because he seemed much too serious.  Her mother was no fun to be around either.  There is a scene where Isabel and two kids are speaking all Spanish.  Since I am in my third year of Spanish, I could probably pick up what they're saying, but they talk really fast.

It could ruin his career to stay in that character forever. I think he shouldn't follow David Schwimmer and Jennifer Aniston into a career of romantic comedies and instead take after Courteney Cox(scream), Lisa Kudrow(the opposite of sex) and Matt Le Blanc(lost in space) who all started to do something a little different away from their Friends persona. Having said that, Fools Rush In is tolerable. Salma Hayek is a talented actress who will go far if she stops clinging onto Robert Rodriguez(the faculty, desperado, from dusk til dawn). Perry is adequate, like I said, but should try to concentrate on a new image. Support comes from excellent Carlos Gomez(enemy of the state, desperado) as a relative of Hayek. The story is fine. Two star crossed lovers meet, get down to business, and get married. After the marriage, both realise that they've made a mistake, and try their hardest to move on from that mistake. For a nights entertainment, 'Fools' is fine. The performances are not oscar worthy, but at the same time, don't suck. If you love romantic comedies then this will go down well.

Cue emotions pulled apart, a hasty marriage, family strife and many stumbling blocks getting in the way of potential true love.Sound familiar? Not surprisingly this retread of a formula that is as old as the hills has very little originality. The script is desperately dull, the ending is exactly what the world expects and the leads have zero chemistry. That only Perry and Hayek are names in the film speaks volumes one feels. You get the sense that what budget there was went on getting the sexy Hayek and Perry riding on the crest of his Friends wave to appear. Little flashes of comedy do from time to time surface, and, yes, those who like a cheery cup of the love froth with their rom-coms will feel fuzzy come the end.

I would have liked to have seen more of the real beauty of the Southwest.Otherwise, this has the depth of a Harlequin romance. The acting around Ms. Hayek is okay, but pretty standard TV level acting. Both main characters seem overly arbitrary in their relations with each other. The complications that separate the two seems a bit overly long making one impatient since we all know everything will end up all right. Salma's lying about her pregnancy struck me as especially lame.

Whoever is responsible  for the story and screenplay--the producers Anna  Maria Davis and Doug Draizin (whose own romance was  seminal to this picture) or writers Joan Taylor and  Katherine Reback--should have started at that idyll  of Salma Hayek's in the Mexican backwater, because  they give her character Isabel Fuentes more color  and history than anything else in the movie.  She is  rooted in her regard for her fierce Hispanic  great-grandmother and her quasi-Catholic loyalties,  and it's her family that the movie should first  introduce to us.  Instead they start with workaholic WASP executive  Alex Whitman in New York celebrating a recent  success.  They should be telling us what it is about  the Big Apple that he likes so much that he'd have a  hard time parting with it and moving to Las Vegas to  please his determined wife, but it doesn't.  They  make Alex do it, because he believes it's the right  thing, but that leaves very little for him to do but  follow Isabel's lead.Matthew Perry seems whipped throughout, and the  comedy here is on a Grade-B sitcom level.  The  comedy should have been dropped for a treatment that  pointed to the tension between the two cultures  caused by them trying to peacefully co-exist.   Rather than hauling baseball bats and brandishing  firearms for laughs, seeing the two families  squirming to get along might have given this picture  more depth, something only Anne Betancourt as  Isabel's mother manages to provide.There are times when Isabel's choices call into  question her judgment, one of them being why she'd  pick Alex over her ex-boyfriend Chuy, when he is  being played by dark, confident Carlos Gomez.   Isabel is not submissive like her mother, so it's  logical that she'd pick a man whose fire doesn't  conflict with hers.  But can she really have much  respect for Alex, when she's leading him around like a puppy dog? I think not.  And by the time they  reunite in the pouring rain over Hoover Dam and  marry on some bluff overlooking a pale Grand Canyon, you wonder if this New Age version of happily  ever-after is just another divorce waiting to  happen.A young John Bennett Perry could have filled the  part of Alex amply, but at his present age, he is  relegated to playing Alex's dad, and his wife is  Jill Clayburgh who in the few minutes that she's on  looks like she's wondering what possessed her to say yes to this movie.

These last 11 years brought to a mass distribution many films from some Latin American cinema industries, and the lives depicted in those films proved films like this one ridiculous. There's more than coloured walls, Christian beliefs and certain paternal macho attitudes in Mexican culture, as in any culture.

However, it put its characters in relatively possible situations. Fools Rush In, on the other hand, makes justice to its title but the things the film's characters live are virtually impossible. Alex Whitman (Matthew Perry) and Isabel Fuentes (Salma Hayek) meet one night and they have sex in something three months later Alex calls one of those beautiful, spontaneous things of life, in one of Katherine Reback's only script's few well written scenes (no wonder she never worked again). But now Isabel is pregnant, and when the film married them very soon, I stayed quiet and waited, because 'fools rush in', you know, and maybe the best was about to come.In formulaic romantic comedies, you have two basic plot-lines 1)the couple meets but they are never really together until the final moments, whatever may happen in the middle; 2)they are well together (as in marriage or a nice relationship) and then something comes and screws things up and someone has to make them right.That second road is the one director Andy Tennant, from the also regular Sweet Home Alabama, takes with this piece. It's not a bad road to take, and the script's premise is not a poor one, but its development is. And you have to blame writer and director for turning something interesting into a bunch of stereotypes about culture and religion.During one scene, Alex's father and Isabel's discuss why their respective sons shouldn't be together. It's a ridiculous moment; they talk about black and white, about Christians and Presbyterians and other subjects the movie hadn't brought until that point? Why do it so late then? Both John Bennett Perry and Tomas Milian overact the scene completely and they should be embarrassed.Actually, there's a lot of overacting in Fools Rush In, and if it weren't for Hayek and Perry's chemistry it would be a bad film. They make it an enjoyable rush. Both look so young, Perry with all the success from Friends at the time, Hayek in her first romantic lead in Hollywood. Jon Tenney and Siobhan Fallon also help in their respective best friend character. But that's that, and sometimes it can be almost enough for a good film. I know I didn't explain the impossible situations, but it's something you should experience without me giving examples.

Of course they fall in love and get married and the movie is about to start. They are pretty different so a lot of problems come on their way.From the beginning you know how it is going to end and unfortunately the way to that ending is a little predictable as well. The performances make this movie a little better. Matthew Perry, who always is a little like his character in 'Friends', has some funny things although sometimes it seems he is trying to hard. Salma Hayek is very loveable and really makes something of her character. In the end I had a pretty good time watching the movie but I have to admit it was not very good.

The whole plot to the movie is bad and everything here is so boring. If the movie would of had a different actress playing the female role, instead of the awful Hayek, then maybe I would of enjoyed it more. This is not recommended, even if you're a Perry fan.

What i liked about this film was the fact that the ideas were original and not cliched.  If any one want a good script written contact meJawad "},{"Title":"chicken soup without the chicken","Date":"6 January 2000","Score":"2 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  I have been extremely surprised at the good reviews this movie has received at this site, given the high level of criticism that I have observed of other movies at this same site. I guess many people wouldn't even bother to say anything about this bland, unemotional,anticlimactic and pseudo sentimentalist film which would only please secretaries, school teachers, nurses, construction workers, college students studying business degrees and the so called nice people of this planet. Lack of substance, and predictable mannerisms make this film an event only greater than a fly landing on my popcorn. I will give this film 0.2 to counterbalance the other comments.  "}]
