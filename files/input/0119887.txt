[{"Title":"Another Movie You Either Like or Dislike","Date":"28 January 2004","Score":"26 out of 35 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  This is a comedy spoof of Van Damme's 'Hard Target' and Ice-T's 'Surviving The Game'.  It takes an ethnic con-artist and gives him a chance to win $50,000 if he makes it to the end of the race.  The twist the plot follows is someone is hunting him for sport.  Once this is realized by our main character, he's got to find a way to stop this and save his own life at the same time.Using John Leguizamo as the main character offers a bit of crude slapstick comedy that does present very funny episodes during the movie.  For some the plot slows down and the rugged humor is a little too childish.  What would you expect from a spoof?  We're not trying to recreate a cinematic masterpiece in all seriousness, but the point is well argued that there could have been more development in the script and screenplay. The cast was well chosen for the picture and this is definitely something for the college cult classic movie watchers to incorporate in to their stash as the years go by for good laughs and an occasional throw pillow moment.  The picture is truly not for those who don't enjoy simple humor antics that parody childish home behavior.This movie is definitely worth renting once or twice for viewing with a good crowd of friends.

Pest is desperate to raise $50,000 to stave off having his legs broken, Vargas takes an offer for a very high paying one day job from Gustav Shank (Jeffrey Jones), a German businessman visiting Florida. However, it's not until later that Vargas finds out what Shank has in mind. The lunatic white supremacist Shank transports Vargas to his island compound, Little Germany, and announces that he will hunt him as wild game. If Vargas can survive for 24 hours, he gets the cash; otherwise, his head will join the others stuffed and mounted on Shank's wall. I know this movie got bad rating, but you must understand its supposed to be funny and it is just stupid harmless fun.

Idiot plot has him picked for a manhunt to which if he survives he receives $50, 000, which is exactly what he owes the Scottish mob. Production is cheap with vulgar humour including a scene where Pest pukes in full view of the camera before his friend pukes in his face. Is this suppose to be funny? How about the scene where this idiot takes a dump while a deer observes from a distance. Stupidity hits its strongest once he is hunted back to the city where his girlfriend and family are kidnapped. Director Paul Miller displays little talent especially when opening the film like a music video with Pest making vulgar noises in the shower. John Leguizamo plays Pest as an idiot who mugs every scene shamelessly. His performance is so bad that it makes Jim Carrey's work in Ace Ventura Pet Detective look award worthy. Jeffrey Jones is every bit as bad as the man hunting Pest. Is this guy for real? Jones is at the mercy of material that presents him as the dumbest villain in film history. Thankfully Ferris Bueller's Day Off demonstrates what a terrific comedic villain he can portray.

With the right editing and focus, this could have been comparable to one of the early Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau movies. Here's an example of a cinematic half-measure John Leguizamo (playing the title character) slips all the way down a staircase and tries to be nonchalant about it. The scene is shot in such a way that you only see the upper part of his body. You don't see his feet slipping. You don't see his feet even begin to slip. It's clear the shot was set up either to avoid danger to the actor or to avoid the tedium of filming the slide down the stairs. If a slapstick movie is what this team wanted to make, they could have hired a stuntman or done some trick photography. Instead, the effect is that the viewer notices that nobody actually slid down a staircase. Because the song the Pest sings in the opening credits is filled with lines from old comedies and Warner Brothers cartoons, the viewer expects the Pest to be a combination of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and any number of other forcefully comic characters. On a stage, Leguizamo controls his game. But the director of THE PEST has no comic timing and scenes which should have had a real edge are dulled. The one standout performance is by Eduordo Ballerini in a thankless role. That his character seems to have a sense of conflict is entirely Ballerini's own doing; the script and the direction don't allow the extra dimension, but he found it. His performance is the reason to watch this movie.John Leguizamo is an actor who embraces the world, but he's playing to an audience he perceives as closed-minded. This must enrage him.

The Pest owes the scottish mafia (yes, the scottish mafia, complete with token kilts and hats on) $50.000, so he agrees to let some nazis (yes, some nazis) pay him $50.000 to try and kill him within 24 hours. As plots go, that's not the worst I've come across. Not the best, either, but it's not a total cliche. So far, so good.So, off we go, into a movie where the plot and the characters are completely secondary to scenes whos only merit is giving The Pest an opportunity to dress up as some hideous stereotype. Not one major ethnic group is left unscathed by The Pest's 'subtle-as-a-world-war' protrayals of them. These ingenious protrayals involve the Pest, dressed up to look like, say, a jewish rabbi, and acting like the Pest saying things like 'meshugginger'. The acting skills involved are not huge.When he is dressed as himself, he simply tries to steal the show by making mildly funny faces, saying extremely moronic things, grinning all the time and dancing for no reason.

What happens in the actual movie is about as puerile as it gets.Someone has told the script writer that the basic, human emotions are what makes a script great. This is true, but the writer seems to have misunderstood this and built the entire script around basic, human functions instead. In a harrowing 5-minute sequence, for instance, the 'laughs' involve farting in the forest, using a sock to wipe with, nazis sniffing said sock, overblown homosexual innuendo, vomiting in the face and finally bird doo on the face. This is of course all swamped in The Pest saying stupid things and acting stupidly.The bad guys, mainly the nazis, are of course also mindblowingly stupid, and the Pest is never really threatened by them. In the bleak moment near the end where it seems the bad guys have won, I was in fact relieved by the hope that I wouldn't see the Pest again. No such luck, of course.A good example of bad guy stupidity coupled with The Pest's pointless and irritating behaviour is found in the scene, where the Pest delivers chinese food to the bad guys. He walks in, observed by the bad guys, and immediately starts riding around the living room on an antique hellebarde wearing an antique helmet. Thus diverting attention from himself, he starts stealing stuff right under the nose of main nazi, who doesn't notice anything. Ah yes, how believable.The script supervisor also seems to have read through the script and saying No, no, there is a 2 minute window in the film where somebody's groin is not in the action or dialogue. Change that, so that The Pest's groin bursts into flames and he takes all his clothes off.This is a bad film. It tries to spoof itself by having the nazis laugh maniacally for about four hours (please let it be a spoof) but you just can't do it with such lousy base material. It diverts into momentary surrealism a la Zuckerman films once in a while, but it's pointless every time, so you just ignore it and chalk it up to The Pest acting so stupidly, that the natural laws of science have switched this turkey of a movie of the TV and gone to bed.

At the movie's start, as his family waits impatiently outside the bathroom door, Pest is rapping in the shower, imitating characters ranging from Ricky Ricardo to Jerry Lewis' Nutty Professor.Pest works as a delivery boy at Mr. Cheung's Chinese restaurant in Miami. But he seems to make most of his money from scams, as we see in the first few minutes after the shower concert.Pest owes $50,000 to Scottish mobster Angus. He needs a miracle, and he may have found one when Gustav offers him a chance at $50,000 if Pest will go on a hunting trip with Gustav, Leo and Gustav's son Himmel. Poor Himmel can't please his cruel father, who once locked him in a room with a snake. He finds enjoyment in 'Hogan's Heroes' reruns, which apparently remind him of his own life.Pest's best friends are Chubbs and Ninja. His girlfriend is Xantha Kent, whose best friend is Malaria. Pest's first meeting with Xantha's parents doesn't go well at all.I found John Leguizamo appealing and funny, but I can easily see how one might get annoyed with him. He pretended to be blind, Chinese, Japanese, German, and even Jewish. If you find 'Family Guy' offensive, you are advised to stay away from this movie, which relies heavily on stereotypes and politically incorrect humor. But 'Family Guy' is one of my favorite shows, even though it occasionally goes too far for my taste. This movie might have too, but it was cleaned up for TV.The movie got off track about halfway through, but it didn't continue with the same storyline for as long as I expected, which was a relief. The rest of the movie was much better.It's not a great comedy, but for some of us it is a good laugh.

It was a route I knew well, crappy road windy hills. Not a nice journey to experience whilst still in the depths of a Mastika hangover. Still these things have to be done.Any how this film just came up on our journey, and with a hangover it really was the funniest film I'd ever seen, although trying to watch it whilst trying not to be sick was something of a challenge. It had not helped that after a short pit stop on the way we got back on the bus last and had ended up on the worst seats, the one's at the back. So I might well just have been on a ferry crossing in rough seas. Going green doesn't't even describe it.Any back to the film, well this stupid idiotic film came on, and bizarrely enough it was excellent. Totally carried by the sharp intensity of lead actor, yes that guy that also did the voice over for the Ice Age Sloth. I felt like I was watching Jim Carrey before Jim Carriey's time.

However, while it is standard to list out other cast members, for this film there really is no need; The Pest is a John Leguizamo film through and through, mainly to its detriment. While the film contains the cult charm and wackiness that I can understand would appeal to others, I won't mince words by saying that whenever John Leguizamo was doing a racial impression or making a fart/dick/gay joke (an abundance of all are within this movie) I prayed that the villain would just shoot him in his annoying head. The worst part of the movie comes at the beginning, during an extremely bizarre rapping sequence with Leguizamo in the shower that made me chuckle approximately 0 times, and this is exemplary of the main problems with the film The Pest is not funny, he's annoying. I mean the character The Pest, specifically. Because, while the film is scatterbrained, nonsensical, and replete with logical errors and puzzling actions, I actually found myself laughing quite a bit at the performances of the other characters. With a change in writing and performance from the titular character, I might have actually enjoyed this film; just a typically clichéd 90s comedy but with a bizarre premise that could land in some very intriguing situations. I'm sure that the cast and crew all found Leguizamo very funny, an assumption that is pretty much verified by Jeffrey Jones clearly trying not to laugh during an early scene in the movie. This is probably why he was clearly allowed to ad-lib so much throughout. However, while I'm sure he's a nice guy, I really can't stand him, and the only reason I'm giving this film a 3 instead of below is due to the interesting premise, the occasional funny joke, and the fact that I'm sure that it's only really my sense of humor that prevented me from enjoying this film. If you find people like Carrot Top or Robin Williams or other energetic comedians funny, you'll probably like this.

The Plot and script for this movie are bad but this movie isnt about the plot or about anything at all! Thats what all you movie buffs out there that despise this movie have to realize. This is the kind of movie where you just sit back, clear your head and laugh your ass off at all kinds of dumb stuff. The movie is full of racial profiling of blacks, jews, gays and so on but John was only messing around with this movie and trying to get some laughs out of people. Now if your looking for a movie with a smart plot and great acting then this movie isn't for you but if your looking for a dumb movie that will make you laugh than I recommend that you rent The Pest. What I really enjoyed about this movie is that the director really tries to make The Pest annoying so that you yourself want to kill him and John Leguizamo pulls it off. To tell you the truth after watching the movie a couple of times I found myself with a bad headache but I still went back and watched it some more. Its one of those movies that you either love or hate or love and hate at the same time. I myself love and hate it at the same time, there are some pretty bad fart and poop jokes thrown in their that I'm not a big fan of and a lot of little parts that dont seem to go with the movie but you still gotta go with it and if you have a good sense of humor and like stuff like Ace Ventura Pet Detective and Beavis and Butthead or Southpark then you might end up liking this movie. Personally I am a big fan of John Leguizamo and think that he is a very talented actor and comedian but many people think otherwise and are entitle to their opinion. I think John Leguizamo was the perfect actor for The Pest and he did a great job being a pest, which was his role in the movie.

This movie is NOT an Academy Award winner but it certainly is not trying to be. I'd say a cross between The Mask and Deuce Bigalo with a big chunk of Happy Gilmor.

The plot is a copy of Hard Target (not a great movie itself) however this made me realise how much I enjoyed Woo's first US film.

His name, how known it was at the time or not, tried to sell it.I was pretty disappointed with the performance of Leguizamo. His days on House of Buggin' (an In Living Colour clone), were his tip-top. There is a fine line between wackiness and idiocy, and we'll just say that Leguizamo crossed it tenfold. He looked like he was trying to be too outrageous and crazy for the camera. As a matter of fact, I'll say that he tried too hard. Madcap humor spilled over into stupidity, and the film was spoiled. I can't say I blamed him, if you were given this opportunity, you'd try as hard if you could, right? Your eagerness cost you dearly though Mr. Leguizamo...The Pest follows in the tradition of any comedy film, and plays the race card, and more. No group is left out from being poked fun at. Blacks, Latinos, whites, Jews, Koreans, Germans, homosexuals, and the blind are among those singled out. Again here, things get too overboard, and too much tries to get spoofed in too little time. The resolution of the film takes all of five minutes to clear up and move back to normality.When you have a film, and you're going to bypass plot and reality for comedy's sake, just make sure it's funny, or all you have is 90 minutes of senseless film.

I was sitting in my living room and this movie came on one of the local channels. I made it about an hour through before I simply had enough. Curious to see what the general movie-opinionated public thought of this movie, I looked it up on this site. I was absolutely shocked to see that there were an overwhelming amount of people that thought it was great. I needed to have my say, and here it is This movie is absolute garbage. It was a chore to sit through. The jokes were uninspired rehashes from other, better shows and movies, and Leguizamo's manic portrayal of this obnoxious character should only appeal to age ten and below. That actually may be a stretch even for that age. I'm all for slapstick ridiculousness, but there isn't even the faintest hint of wit or cleverness. I have an idea, lets take bad uninspired obvious jokes and play them at twice the speed. Now that's funny. Ha. Ha.Movies that you should see that take silly humor and add comic timing and originality The Marx Brothers' A Night at the Opera, Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, South Park Bigger, Longer, and Uncut,...and the list goes on. Don't lose an hour and a half of your life on unmemorable crap.By the way, I can only assume that the reason that David Bar Katz (the other writer) did VERY little in film after this movie is because he was instantly blacklisted. I'm actually impressed that Leguizamo was able to recover after this mess.

I don't recall ever seeing a movie that's more insulting to the talented actors or the audience watching.  In my 30 years of watching movies, this is the only one I have ever walked out of.  Bad humor, bad jokes, bad gags, bad editing, bad plot, etc.  Note to producer  It's never funny to hunt humans based on race.  Great that you tried to be politically correct by incorporating all races, but you're still hunting humans based on race, and that's sickening.

The name of the movie is descriptive, he is the pest. This movie is a must miss.

It is without a doubt the WORST movie I have ever witnessed, the worst.I remember hearing about this movie from a friend, and decided to view it. If I could I could turn back time, I would. I will regret for as long as I live, the time I wasted watching this rubbish.The storyline is so insane; it just makes no-sense at all and leaves you confused. There is a Scottish mob and a German headhunter who are after Pestario 'Pest' Vargas (John Leguizamo), the Scottish mob after $50,000 dollars and the Germans after his head.In trying to escape The Pest, takes the form of many disguises. But in doing this we witness some of the most annoying, worst, mind numbing acting, dialogue and sounds in cinema history. This movie annoyed me so much; by the end I was full of aggression. I was so angry that I had wasted so much time watching a movie that would surely drive depressed people to almost certain suicide. I mean how can there be hope when a movie like this can be given permission to be made?I know people have their own opinions, but the most shocking thing about The Pest is that people actually like it. Why? What is funny about a man that is annoying from the very first second to the last? A man who cannot act? Who has an annoying voice and confusing face?I sat through it thinking the movie would get better, surely it would. It did not. Usually, you want the good guy to survive, but I wanted the Germans or the Scottish mob to find and kill The Pest, anything to put me out of my misery. There is nothing funny, interesting or normal that happens in this movie, its just plain annoying and confusing. The jokes are dead even before they are told. I feel sorry for the cameramen who have no say in how the movie is made, but actually have to film this drivel. I wouldn't be surprised if they are receiving counselling.If you want to remain sane and part of society, my advice is to never watch this movie. I'd rather lock myself in my room for 5 weeks and go without food and water than watch this movie again!I don't think I'll ever hate anything more than this.

It's a vehicle to showcase the dubious talents of John Leguizamo, apparently the world's most irritating and least entertaining man. Like a Latino Chris Rock but without the shyness and self effacing humility. I actually watched this having been taken in by the favourable comment then shown on this site without hitting search for other comments. In retrospect the reason for this individual's thorough enjoyment of The Pest is obvious from the terrible grammar, missing and multiple punctuation, and towards the end of the review, CAPITAL letters appearing in the MIDDLE of sentences for NO apparent REASON. An example of the film's humour The star does a rap in the shower over the opening credits, involving various impressions. The longest of these is The Count from Sesame Street, counting his farts which he calls stinkie pinkies and making mock disgusted faces.

I thought this movie was incredibly hilarious. It reminded me a lot of a story I read in high school called 'The Most Dangerous Game'John Leguizamo is wacky and crazy through the entire film.

If Pest survives for 24 hours, Gustav will give him $50,000. When Pest escapes the Island, Gustav and his homosexual son continue to hunt him down in the city.

John is a great comedy actor. I would watch this movie once a year, but I wouldn't say it's one of my favorites. If you want to see John in a more serious role. You can try Romeo+Juliet (1996) version. Most of the other actors in this movie I haven't seen in other roles. I wouldn't be able to recommend anything else.

That aside this is a great movie to sit down and watch on a late Friday night. I think that the characters are fantastic I love Himmle, Ninja, Pest, Chubs, Scotish Mob, and just about everybody else. At a few points in the movie I think it moves a little fast but it adds to the off the wall humor that I really enjoy. Some of Johns impressions are a little stupid but for the most part I actually enjoyed them such as The delivery boy at the beginning of the movie. Also how can you not like Chubs and Ninja? They are very lovable characters that really add to the story. Overall the story seems a little rushed sometimes and half the time I think that the characters should just pop in saying What the plot holes going on here!? But it's still a great movie and I think you can enjoy it lots if you just sit back get some snacks and hit play. "}]
