It's not intelligent, the acting isn't anything special and the plot is sub-par. But it's hilarious, and as a snowboarder wildly entertaining. I watch it in the summer when I miss the season, in the fall when I'm waiting for the season, in the winter when I'm NOT snowboarding, and in the spring when the season is ending. There is so much truth to the movie in some aspects that it just feels right. The movie is so funny in so many little ways, and if you open your mind and are willing to accept it for what it is, I think you'll love it as well. It has a great soundtrack featuring a LOT of Jack Johnson, some Weezer, Sum 41, other stuff, all of which is good. Jason London is great as Rick Rambis, Zach Galifinakis is hilarious as Luke and whoever plays Pigpen does a great job of acting dumber then you would think anyone could actually be. You'll either love it or hate it, but if you snowboard or like to have a good time, I think it will be the former.

The story is basically guy finds girl, girl dumps guy, guy can't get over girl, guy and girl run into each other again, girl explains why it will never work, guy must decide what he should do... Like I said, nothing profound, or original, but there's still fun stuff to be seen.The comedy in the film is what made the movie for me. Zack Galifianakis (Luke) is absolutely hilarious and plays a fantastic character. Jason London, David Denman and Derek Hamilton also have their share of comedic moments.I also feel very much obligated to mention the women in this film. This is reason enough to watch this film. Victoria Silvstedt (Inga) looks nothing less than perfect throughout the film. AJ Cook (Jenny) is also quite the looker and not a bad actress. The last woman I have to mention is Caroline Dhavernas (Anna), very nice!Normally I'm not one to pay too much attention to the music in a film (unless it's just atrocious), but anyhow, I thought the music choices are great in this film. The movie is packed full of great music (my favorites being Eve 6 - Anytime and Weezer - Island In The Sun).All in all, I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who likes snowboarding or just likes comedies. Just don't go in expecting the best movie you've ever seen, it's not the best, but it certainly was worth my money. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

I know it's something we have all seen a million times, but, darn it - we NEED this type of movie.Yeah, yeah, yeah&#133;the story line's predictable idyllic local winter ski haven (Bull Mountain) is under threat by a big-business tycoon's (Lee Majors) plans for turning it into a high rollers' resort town. And, yeah, yeah, yeah&#133;the subplot is equally original  boy loses girl, boy wants girl back, girl has fianc√©, boy must go through trials and tribulations to win girl back, etcetera, etcetera, ad nauseum. Add a few crass scenarios, a big-breasted beauty (Victoria Silvstedt), beer and you've got yourself another boring teen-sex comedy. Right? Not so fast, partner.Out Cold joins the ranks of other great teen comedies (Animal House, Better Off Dead, Caddyshack, and the hundreds of others) in its magical ability to stop time &#150; if just for a moment. Like its predecessors, Out Cold captures that youthful time when friends surround us, we are having the time of our lives and the party never seems like it is going to end. Those are our `rites of passage' years - generally, between the ages of 16-25 - nine very short years.Out Cold takes place in the fictional tiny-town of Bull Mountain, Colorado - elevation 10,000 feet &#150; a winter wonderland of snow, skiing and snowboarding. A place where there's always fluffy powder to plow through and a hilarious friend is at every corner you turn. There's always the local pub to chill in after a hard day of playing &#150; the characters in these movies all have jobs but no one seems to work. Loneliness is not an option. That's what makes this movie (these movies) great. Out Cold isn't just about gross-out gags with guys running around trying to get laid, it's about the escapism that these films offer. Even if you've never experienced the perfect winter or summer vacation &#150; even if you've never gone to that ivy-league school where no student has homework &#150; even if you've only dreamt about spending time at exotic locales with fun in the sun/snow &#150; this is the reason why we NEED this type of movie. If only for ninety minutes, these movies offer a fantasy or nice remembrances of times gone by (or, to come.) For all of you naysayers out there who pooh-pooh this film on the account of its wonderfully juvenile content, I say, `Go see Harry Potter, you bombastic moralist and leave me alone!'

It revolves around a town in Alaska, a ski town, that is about to encounter a shift from a peaceful, secluded atmosphere to a bustling, main stream atmosphere. Our heroes are the snowboard instructors who have to save the day from a irritating, stereotypical land developer. Putting aside the obvious overtones of similar movies of this genre, and dispelling some predictability you really can have a good time. The jokes are funny, the characters have some witty dialog and the story moves briskly. The only drawback for me was the inept love story, but that was balanced out with some good jokes derived from it.

After buying the movie on DVD (available now in all self-respecting stores) I have enjoyed it four more times, and I have to say that not only does this movie not deserve the current ranking in the 4's, but the movie is far better then it is being portrayed.  Out Cold is part teenage-gross-out laugh-fest, part Ode to Casablanca, part kick-ass snowboarding.    This movie is rich in a deep, philosophical plot, in which our protagonist Rick Rambis, is locked into a bitter war to keep his life and his town.  Bull Mountain has been his home forever, and when the departed owner's son decides to sell the mountain (to the Six-Million-Dollar-Man Lee Majors, playing John Majors-no relation) Rick and his n'er-do-well comrades must conform to the new ruler.  Majors foresees the Black Diamond in the Rough as the next Aspen, and begins to change the quaint heritage of the land to conform to his new vision, Snow Nook.  Rick and his friends decide to rebel and take back the mountain. And if the rich plot is not enough, it also has Victoria Silvstadt, former Playmate of the year, Zach Galifianakis, a great comedian who gets his helmut stuck in a hot tub, and a cast of tens of...well...tens of extras. The movie was unfortunately passed over at the Oscars for movies that did not have anyone having sex with a hot tub, that didn't have any playmates, that didn't have the Weezer song Island in the Sun, nor did it have the greatest words of wisdom ever in a movie, No regrets, that's my motte.

The plot focuses on a group of young twenty-something local residents who enjoy snowboarding, getting drunk, getting high, and playing practical jokes on each other. Leading this group of likable misfits is a man named Rick Rambis (played by Jason London), who is unable to form a relationship with attractive snowboarding instructor Jenny (played by A.J. Cook) because he is still pining over a girl he met during a drunken binge in Cancun, Mexico.When wealthy businessman John Majors (played by veteran actor Lee Majors) steps in with the intent of buying Bull Mountain and turning it into an Aspen-like espresso and tofu resort that caters to rich yuppies, the residents of Bull Mountain begin to fear that they will all be fired and forced to leave town. Adding to the turmoil is the arrival of Majors' two daughters Inga, (played by former Playboy Playmate of the Year Victoria Silvstedt) a gorgeous blonde bombshell, and Anna (played by Caroline Dhavernas), Rick's old flame from his Cancun vacation.What follows is a slobs versus snobs comedy in the tradition of Caddyshack and Animal House as the locals try to stop their town from being taken over by Majors and his cronies. The film also directly parodies Casablanca in several parts, with Rick finding himself in a situation similar to Humphrey Bogart's most famous character from his most famous film.The acting or script will never win any awards, but the film does provide enough humor to make it worth a rental. It also features some truly impressive snowboarding footage performed by some of the top snowboarders in the world. I also feel the need to mention David Koechner, who provides a hilarious performance as Stumpy, a hard-drinking, tall-tale telling local who is probably insane.One complaint I have about the movie is that it feels like several scenes were edited or removed entirely so that it would be given a PG-13 rating rather than an R rating. Hopefully someday an unrated DVD will be released.I give this film a 7 out of 10. It's not a classic comedy, but it's entertaining enough to be worth a rental.

It's easily one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. But unlike the critics and a majority of the other people who have commented on this movie, I think that's a good thing.I like stupid movies. Dumb & Dumber, Dude Where's My Car, Naked Gun 33 1/3, BASEketball, A Night At The Roxbury, Tommy Boy, Big Daddy, and Mallrats are examples of irreverent comedies that have received an IMDB rating of 8 or higher from me. I've recently added Out Cold to that list. If you enjoyed any of the above-mentioned films, then you'll probably like this one too.The story is pretty simple; Anthony lives in a small Alaskan town and spends most of his time snowboarding with his friends on the neighboring mountain. A big city businessman comes to town, buys the mountain, and quickly turns the town into a ski resort. His daughter is actually Anthony's long lost girlfriend, so Anthony must choose between winning her back and getting a secure job at the new resort, or keeping the traditions of the mountain (freedom and fun) alive with his friends.Of course, the plot isn't important. What is important are the humor and the characters. Personally, I thought this was a very funny film. It isn't as funny as many of the movies I listed above, but it's better than many other comedies I've seen (BLACK KNIGHT, ME MYSELF & IRENE, and BILLY MADISON for example). I was laughing fairly consistently throughout the entire film. Once or twice there was a joke that fell flat, but overall it delivered. The characters were very fun too. Anthony's friends include a pothead, a crazy guy, a cool ex-girlfriend, an in-the-closet gay man, and more.I don't snowboard or watch snowboarding on TV, but I've been playing SSX on my PS2 a lot lately. If you want to see this movie because you want to see boarding action, then you should probably find something else. The film starts off with two really cool snowboarding sequences and from there it's pretty much snowboard free until near the end. In-between we get the above-mentioned plot and several funny gags, many reminiscent of American Pie.Parents should be warned. This film is rated PG-13, but it's pretty close to an R. Almost all of the jokes are Sex/Drug related and this film contains a surprising amount of nudity. The nudity consists of women taking their tops off, and we can clearly see their breasts, but their nipples are blocked from view. There is also a shot of a man's butt and a lot of scenes contain a statue of this bare-assed man.8/10  "},{"Title":"Out to Lunch.","Date":"4 February 2016","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Sport","Review":" Out Cold (2001) Dir Brendan Malloy, Emmett Malloy / Cast Jason London, Lee Majors, Derek Hamilton, A.

It just came out and I bought it.  Nothing beats snowboarding and beer and racing down a hill with a cup of beer. I love Jason London and Aj.Cook. They were very cute I wish they kissed though that would have made it better. They had a dope relationship but he was not aggressive. Right in front of him he had this beautiful snowboard chick in love with him. I just wish there was a little bit more on them and less on Rick and Ana. She bothered me because she was not for Rick yet he loved her. It should have been all about Jenny and Rick. The other characters just help set up a town that is unique. It shows how people live in little towns and they make it look like the best place in the world. For the people who don't like the plotline or the stupidity....look beyond that and see the relationships and the feel it gives you about culture etc. The town is theirs and see when Ana came for example she ruined the purity of it and Rick. Ignore the imperfections for it is only a movie. Again at the last scene Jenny and Rick should have had a moment on top of Hangmans peak rather than having the narrator tell what happened between them.

I think this movie does exactly what it sets out to do, entertain & take your mind out of the real world. Its a senseless comedy with a loosely planned story around it that which is good, if thats what you plan to see. If you are going to see tonnes of snowboarding trick & special stunts, find something else to watch. If you want to spend an hour & half just watching a goof ball movie that you will laugh at occasionally this will be exactly what you want.

His chiseled facial features and rippling biceps provide a good case against anyone who thinks that Michaelangelo stopped carving fine marble. And his hauntingly beautiful voice is one for the ages, one that plummets deep into the soul of man like some sonic Magic School Bus and penetrates your soul like only Dirk Diggler (and the man himself) could. His presence on the screen is not just magnetic; it causes you to re-evaluate your life. I am of course talking about the one, the only, Derek Hamilton.After seeing this movie, I went to my doctor. He informed me I have 7 broken ribs due to intense laughing, and occasional guffawing. He informed me that if I watched the movie again, I may quite possibly die. But I did not care. I watched it again that very night. I woke up in the intensive care ward of the hospital. The doctor told me I would never walk again. Reader...it was worth it.But there was something else, something deeper than spine-shattering laughter present. It seemed that any time that Derek was not on screen, I fell into a deep depression. My doctor prescribed me zoloft, paxil, but it was no use. There seemed something humanely wrong with not putting this man-- nay, God-- in every single frame of film, and it is the only reason the film is not receiving a 10 out of 10 rating. There is no conceivable reason the credits did not consist of him sitting in a chair reading out names. He could be sitting on the can and it would still be more riveting than the Cuban missile crisis.His portrayal of Pig Pen is the most accurate performance I have ever seen. It has been reported that Marlon Brando died of pulmonary fibrosis. In actuality, he saw Out Cold, and after witnessing the incomparable majesty of Derek's performance, realized that all his method acting training was a gargantuan waste of time, because nothing he had even done had ever caused such cinematic exuberance. He died of a broken heart.I could go on...but I will not. Because every second you spend reading this is a minute that could be spent witnessing the single greatest performance in the history of celluloid. It is said that Stephen Hawking created a time machine, and traveled through wormhole in time when he was 21. When he arrived in the future of 2001, the first thing he saw was a movie theatre that was playing Out Cold. He watched the film, and after doing so, decided to scrap all of his projects, and devote his time to figuring out how Derek Hamilton's performance was so magnificent. He soon lost the use of his arms and legs. You do the math.

Out Cold.First of all, I was expecting a horrible mix of horndog humor, drugs, and sports bloopers.  Well I got that and more.  Sometimes this could have been a bad mix, this time...it was worse.Although I can appreciate gratuitous nudity, humorous injuries, clique'd plots, and other facets of the teen movie,  I have no capacity for bad acting, and even less for annoying characters.  This movie had that and more. (Spoilers) The main character was whinny, and boring.  For whatever reason, Lee Majors thought he was the best worker at the lodge, and promotes him.  We've only really seen Jenny working, barely, but thats not important.  His character lacks any depth other than he hates a song, and he can't get over a girl. Whatever.  He's not nearly annoying as his friends.The acting of his friends seems to be their ability to laugh and scream, and mutter a few words like testicle once and a while.  Hell I can do that, and I'd do it for half the amount of money these idiots probably got, Hollywood take note, I can say five words and laugh very easily.The only other problem I had was with the character Lance.  Why oh why is there a gay character in every movie lately, especially stupid movies? I'm not homophobic, in fact i'm bisexual.  I just don't think that gay characters add anything to films, unless the plot hangs on this somehow. For example lance could have found out that Majors was gay also and embarass him with photos of their steamy love session.

And all those kooky, sex drenched comedies like Hot Dog The Movie and Better Off Dead?  Well imagine if those two films bred and had a child today.  That would be this movie, a pale imitator to the crown of crass taste.The plot &#150; such as it is &#150; concerns the Alaskan ski hamlet inhabited by a ragtag gang of drinking buddies who &#145;work' for the local ski resort that is on the skids no thanks to the inheritor of the lodge Muntz (Garson) whose late dad was the inspiration of debauchery intermingled with extreme sports (skiing downhill with his pants down) that the aforementioned rogues gallery of misfits take to heart especially when magnate cum cowboy John Majors (The Artist-Formerly-Known-As-Steve Austin The Six Million Dollar Man, Majors looking surprisingly out-of-shape) decides to sink his claws into the struggling business to make it his own (namely a corporate funless spa for the nouveau riche). That won't do for Rick (London, best known as Pink in Dazed and Confused), the good-looking, likable slacker whose comrades including idiot siblings Pig Pen and Luke (Hamilton and Galifanakis), token black guy Anthony (Alexander) who has issues skiing down steep mountains, closeted flamer Lance (Denman) and tomboy hottie Jenny (Cook).  To make matters worse Rick's old girlfriend Anna (Dhavernas) arrives and turns out to be Majors' daughter.  Anna hurt Rick real bad (think another Rick, Blaine of Casablanca  and how he hurt bad when he found out his true love came back in all the gin joints in all the world&#133;)  Faced with unemployment and a lack of a life without the snowboarding shenanigans for these buds they decide to fight back. The usual pedestrian, sophomoric hi-jinks ensue largely thanks to the diminutive, scruffy Galifanakis &#150; i.e. having sex with a Jacuzzi; his frequent drunken passing-outs; etc.  And add to the mix former Playboy Playmate (1997) sex kitten Silvstedt, an Anna Nicole Smith clone, who quite frankly doesn't even get naked (!)  Toothless sex comedy should be more accurate. The snowboarding/skiing stunts are the true stars of the film but even that is a stretch.  Too bad in these politically correct times; snobs vs. slobs is always a welcome even if it is going through the motions.

It tries hard to give the audience a graceful combination of physical humor, sexual slap-stick, classic Hollywood references, and X-treme sport clips, but in the end it face plants hard into the cinematic pavement. While I will not be generous to this film, I will begin this review by mentioning how proud I am of Out Cold. Again, this was nowhere near a good film, but as a person that watches films on a consistent basis, I saw Out Cold as a film that tried really hard to be humorous, original, and creative, but just failed miserably. One must give credit to those films that fail while trying, because so many films today just, honestly, fail to try. Unoriginality seems to be a common theme among these tween films, as big boobs, beer drinking, and clich√© characters invade the screen more often than humorous dialogue that invades your mind and into modern culture. Out Cold aims towards a general audience that I despise. That audience is one that will pay top dollar for stupid humor that demonstrates no talent and a considerable lack of creativity. Why do we, as audience members, do that? Is it that difficult for us to laugh at intelligent humor? While Out Cold did not begin the trend in Hollywood, it did contribute to it, and thus continuing films like Date Movie, American Wedding, and Dude, Where's My Car to plague our theaters.I think I have spoken enough about my personal belief on why this film was a wart on the back of Hollywood, so let's look at actual reasons why this film tried and failed. I have to get this first one out in the open. Why, painfully I ask this question, did the filmmakers see the quality in combining tween humor, snowboarding, and Casablanca together in one film? The first two matched, but the last was just pure rubbish. Outside of an adult audience, not many children or teens would catch the classic Hollywood film reference, thus completely ruining the remains of a dying film genre. Now, when the audience of Out Cold actually connect Casablanca to Out Cold, they will say lines like This movie is just like Out Cold. This makes me so angry. If parents would raise their children correctly in film most will say, Out Cold took quite a bit from Casablanca, instead of the other way around. Casablanca needs to come first. With that said, our biggest pitfall to this film was the characters. Were there any? Great question! I didn't see any. Instead, I saw actors reacting to certain situations. There were no definitions to anyone. Sure, one could argue that there were some characters with Pig Pen and Inga, but when I see these moments, I see clich√©s, not characters. Anyone can play a druggie, stoner, big-breasted woman, town idiot, and so forth, but it is how that actor chooses to redefine that overused character that really sets a film apart from the rest. Nothing of the sort happened here. Jason London was horrid as the title character, and his supposed girlfriend was as bland as Illinois. Jason's friends were obnoxiously unexciting and Lee Majors walked on set, said his lines, and walked off. Again, there was nothing of value. Nobody went beyond the lines on their script, which ultimately hurt the overall viewing experience of this film.If I were to pick one element that kept this film from completely drowning would be the use of David Koechner, of whom I cannot help but laugh at whenever he opens his mouth. He is the prime example of what I was hoping the direction would be for these filmmakers. He was a unique character for Bull Mountain and thus created some of the better lines for the film, if only the rest of the cast would have taken his lead. Yet, I do not blame the cast for it all, the filmmakers (the Malloy brothers) had to make the underlying decision to either make another tween film, or sharpen the humor and aim towards a smarter audience. As you may or may not have noticed, they went with the latter. The entire King of the Mountain bit was horrendous, not because of the storyline element, but the fact that everyone's beer was flying, nobody recognized anyone, and only the characters we were familiar with were winners. Just disrespectful to the rest of those that inhabits Bull Mountain. The funniest bit that I think the Malloys were able to pull off were the brotherly pranks pulled when one was too drunk. The first one with the polar bear was not funny (rather juvenile), but the one with the car continues to put a smile on my face. It was this type of humor that I was expecting the entire film, but overall continued to keep falling short.Overall, Out Cold felt like your last pick to be your date for prom. Sure, there were some elements that were decent enough to smile at, but most of the time you were embarrassed to be seen with her in public. I am tired of this tween genre of film, and while I know that due to an increasing decline in intelligence in our theaters we will only continue to see more of this type of movie, I am still tired of it. It is as if most directors are just using the cut & paste feature on their editing machines bringing us the same jokes that have been told once with success, but over time, they just become boring. Again, I will say that of most of the films in this genre, Out Cold did try a bit harder to be beyond the mold, but in the end it was nothing spectacular.Grade ** out of ***** "},{"Title":"Very boring, uneventful film.

But why go to all the trouble of having the main character be Rick and the lost love interest have a European accent?  And lines like I told you never to play that song, You're getting on that plane, We'd lost that until you came here, and so forth are just so blatant if you're a fan of Casablanca.  Of course what are the odds that viewers of this movie have even seen Casablanca? Which leads me to two possible reasons for ripping off a 50+ year old movie1. It was meant to be some sort of funny inside joke (b/c obviously most under 20 snowboard heads aren't going to be amused)2.

It is a sex comedy, but not nearly as clever as `Old School' or `There's Something About Mary.' Normally I would say that this is because of the PG-13 rating, holding back the film, but in this case not so If I took a guess, I'd say this movie is rated R. It's full of crude sexual humor, not to mention nudity.  No, what really makes this film disturbing is its pride; it thinks it is the next `Animal House,' but it isn't. It's full of clich√©s The token black guy, the big-busted blonde, the druggie, the fat slob, and the good guy who is falling in love with the already-taken girl. A film like `Old School,' though visibly stupid, is smart enough to know its place `Out Cold' is just a big havoc, filled with bad jokes and stupid sex gags.Forgive my ignorance, but I didn't pay much attention to the plot - because there isn't a very deep one here. It's about a band of snowboarders, led by `Dazed and Confused' star Jason London, who try to keep their run-down, Alaskan `Bull Mountain' from being turned into a commercial resort attraction by Mr. Majors (Lee Major's, from TV's `The Six Million Dollar Man'). Stupidity follows, hilarity does not.The plot comes in half way through the movie. It is as if the filmmakers just needed to have an excuse for dropping a bunch of snowboarders on us, so they came up with something ridiculous to introduce their characters to an audience. That ridiculous something was the plot of this film.I must say that after a while, one of the characters started to grow on me. The Fat Slob of this movie was actually obnoxiously funny. It's obvious the directors of the movie thought they could dupe the audience into mistaking him for John Belushi. It didn't work, but when The Fat Slob was on screen I had an OK time. That was about it - the rest of the movie left a dry mouth in my taste. Among many sex gags is this Two men going into a lesbian chat room and flirting with each other, both pretending they are women and both men thinking they are talking to another woman; a man getting his testicles stuck in a Jacuzzi when he puts it on `suck'; a woman riding a mechanical bull sensuously (wasn't that done in `Charlie's Angels 2' and just about every other movie ever made that involves blondes in bars?).the list goes on. It's just not funny, it's a bunch of dumb gags.This brings me to my conclusion The PG-13 rating is a disgrace. I was astonished to find nudity in this film. Not just once or twice, but numerous shots of the sides of bare female breasts. This movie flopped at the box office, and it appears that it was so small a film that it even slipped by the rating system. It pains me to know that a film like About Schmidt, a moving film anyone 13 or over should see, gets tagged with an R-rating, yet a stupid, sex-comedy like this breezes by.

The have succeeded in some cases (American Pie), but most of time they fall flat on their face.  The ideal of putting them in a ski lodge, like this movie did, has been done several times before in movies like Hot DogThe Movie, Ski School, and Ski Patrol.

There is a lot of implied sex and nudity, but not a lot shown.  There isn't even much swearing in this movie.  This is probably because the studio required them to get a PG-13 rating for the movie.       Besides the teen sex comedy theme, there is no reason to come see this movie.  There are a couple of good skiing/snowboarding shots but they are pretty brief and infrequent, the acting is suitable but not great, and the storylines are fragmented and sometimes confusing.  For example, there is a scene (shown in the commercial for the movie) where a guy says I need some paint, a bucket, and a pound of salt.  Later you see him with the paint, bucket, and salt but you never really find out what he needs it for.  There are a lot of scenes like that.
