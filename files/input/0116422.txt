I bought it after getting my hands on the soundtrack, which is also awesome, and it really hit the spot. Like many people have said before, if you've ever been in a similar situation, this film will resonate deeply! It really is intriguing to read reviews from people who hated it. Obviously that makes just as much sense as people who loved it, not everyone can relate to the story or understand the journey, but i wouldn't want people to be put off from seeing it purely on the strength of the negative reviews. Great performances from the whole cast, perfectly balanced with a brilliant punk soundtrack. A real gem.

Their stories intertwine, and involve each other in some way. All of the plots involved in Glory Daze are simple, but flow smoothly and steadily in the backdrop of campus parties and bonfires. The acting is superb and the cast is simply perfect(of course it's better to watch the movie now when most of the actors (Ben Affleck, Sam Rockwell, and French Stewart) all become more well known names. All of them are perfect in their roles as bewildered college students. I love the end of the movie (but I won't spoil anything). I recommend this movie to anyone, especially teenagers, who just want to watch a movie about the fun and anxiety of the last days of real youth. 9/10. I also recommend Dazed And Confused, a great teen movie.

Without close examination of this movie's characters and their development, your average watcher would write this movie off as standard party movie genre with no heart or empathy. But, as a fan of this film, I've grown to see it for what it most likely was intended to be...a pleasant, relatable buddy flick whose characters could have only been based almost entirely on personal relationships. Questions we've all asked ourselves, and conversations we've all had exist in this film, in a non-figurative way. Growing up, and out of your comfort zone is all too common of a post adolescent's defining hour and that is exactly what this movie explores.The music and sense of humor in Glory Daze are proof of a personal reliance towards the materiel and not just some A-hole producer/director trying to cash in on the maturing sentiment. Some might not be able to relate to it because of its seemingly personal aim, have you a too serious metal dude or...well, a girl, but I think that for your average free thinker, its an easy to connect with.I'll keep it short. I'm gonna end with Kevin Smith on this one, I like Affleck, cause he's just a good dude, and so it seems are the rest of the cast and those involved in the creation of Glory Daze.

Everyone extols the virtues of Animal House, calling it the greatest college comedy ever, but for my generation of college students, I bet Glory Daze would be seen as a far better film (if only people would SEE it).Ben Affleck is great in his portrayal of Jack, the ultimate purveyor of suburban angst.  His scene with the jokester passing out graduation gowns is priceless, as is the confrontation on the bus with Brendan Fraser and Leah Remini.  He gives a most memorable performance.The best thing about Glory Daze is its honesty; even the tough, angry Jack breaks down when it comes to love. even he still seeks his funny s**t.

It has just really helped me (nearly 10 years later) to find a bit of closure with what the heck happened back then during the greatest time of my life! I feel the acting was genuinely good. Ben really made the best out of this role. I can tell that the writer/director banged out enough background info. for the actors, so that they could know exactly how their characters should act. I love the scenes of Santa Cruz and especially liked the bus scene between Ben Affleck, Lhea Remini, and Brendan Frasier. Not only was Brendan dressed like I was back then, but I swear, I think, I had a convo. on the bus with a girlfriend while waiting for the damn train to pass, too. Yeah, every bus ride was an adventure! There is a strong moral in the movie, it's hard to find but it can be gleaned from any college graduate. Freedom from Fear leads to a Fear from Freedom. As for any banana slugs out there, save this movie when your thirty and you'll completely realize why you did what you did, and how Santa Cruz will always be on your mind. That's a good thing I believe, because we lived in a very special place that seems to create amazingly talented and successful people. John Garcia -Class of '95 U.C.

Well, yes, they are all in this movie, but no. They are both now famous, respected actors, and movies like 'Glory Daze' helped shape their careers. The movie, set in the 90â€²s, follows a group of college students that just might not be ready to let go of the party life. Angst filled, angry, generation xers souped up on pizza and beer that just do not know where to go in life. I mean we can all relate to that right? Admittedly, when these Hollywood superstars made this movie they certainly weren't at their acting peak, but they held their own. Ben Affleck conveys the perfect combination of anger and uncertainty in life, and when you throw in relationship issues he becomes a pretty evolved character. Rockwell, the one with the girlfriend in the movie, faces an issue of every graduating guy in his position, do I stick with her and get serious, or do I go get some strange? His struggle is uncomfortable to watch, in a good way, especially when Matthew McConaughey makes a cameo showing him what his life could be if it goes terribly wrong. To avoid forming a list here I will just say the others also did a great job playing their parts, especially Slosh (Vien Hong), the former computer geek, current party animal.Unlike some college movies that play off of pretty much every college stereotype, 'Glory Daze' seems more realistic and genuine. I actually found myself believing that these actors could be college students. They looked a bit old, but it was a far cry from the thirty year olds playing high schoolers on 90210.Writer Director Rich Wilkes (Airheads) does an admirable creating believable characters, but does have some trouble with the flow of the story. I did find that I started to lose focus and become bored at times. A movie like this should be almost like the perfect mix tape, you start of strong, drop it down a notch, then right back up. Instead we start of with Thunderstruck and get twenty minutes of Coldplay, and no one wants that Speaking of mix tapes, 'Glory Daze' has a soundtrack that is filled with that 90â€²s music that is sure to ignite that nostalgic feeling of oh yeah, I remember that  so sit back, enjoy the ride, and remember how much better things were the 90â€²s.

At the time they were marked as new talent to be watched; before they became stars.College comedies tend to be crude and downright stupid. While Glory Daze does have it's moments of such things it is redeemed by some good ensemble playing. Being the story of a bunch of guys renting a house it's crucial that the bond between the characters of this disparate group be palpable. In this, director Rich Wilkes has succeeded. While dealing with the serious issue of making decisions which will affect the rest of one's life, Glory Daze remains light, never losing sight of what it set out to be; a fun movie. While it's not a whole lot of fun, it is watchable. Ben Affleck is surprisingly good in this early role, but that in itself is a back handed compliment, since it also indicates how little he's developed with his elevation to big star status. Sam Rockwell's humor and reticent charm never fails to work, though he's not called upon to do much.
