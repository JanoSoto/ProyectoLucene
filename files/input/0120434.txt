Chevy Chase and cast are very funny in this movie. The Wayne Newton bit was great. I love going to Vegas, and I love this movie. When my wife and I fly to Vegas, we always kid about going to the bathroom to join the club like Clark and Ellen.

Yet, if you can ignore its many irksome qualities, the latest outing with the Griswalds is simply an outrageous, hilarious, and pleasurable romp of a movie. If you laugh at something senseless and absurd, such as Cousing Eddie babbling on about his worthless, pathetic existence, or Clark Griswald finding himself at the edge of the Hoover Dam, or even a busload of tourists crashing into the estate of Mr. Las Vegas, Wayne Newton, so what? Where logic and reasoning are scarce behind the odds of the scenarios the Griswalds encounter, laughs are aplenty to make this one gleeful, jovial outing full of some really effective comedy. The idea of the dysfunctional Griswalds venturing to Vegas for yet another family vacation and finding themselves experiencing the whims of the city of entertainment in their own individual ways, with Clark being a hapless, compulsive gambler, Ellen having somewhat of an affair with Wayne Newton, Rusty hitting it rich at the casinos and masquerading as a playboy, and Audrey aspiring to be an exotic dancer, how hilarious can it get? Couple this with the outrageous imbecilic likes of Cousin Eddie continuing to plague Clark's existence, and Vegas Vacation succeeds in delivering a royal flush of laughs. If it's silly and inane, if scenarios are too illogical for words, and if not everything really comes together by the end, at least you have plenty of funny material to laugh away at, and that makes for a jolly good outing, when you find yourself laughing consistently throughout the film, which warrants a solid recommendation for Vegas Vacation.

Then, in 1997, almost a decade later, another `Vacation' film churned out. The fourth in the series. `Vegas Vacation.' Clark Griswold has finally gotten his break. His food preservatives have been approved, and he has gotten a bonus. Now, what to do with the money? He has an idea. Take the wife and kids to.(big surprise) Vegas! But soon after the ordeal of arriving in Vegas is over, Clark finds himself wasting away his money gambling; especially playing craps! Now, with the help of Uncle> Eddie, he must regain his money, and regain his wife from the grasp of Wayne Newton! Chevy Chase returns to the role of Clark Griswold, he gets these crazy notions and perfect ideas built up in his head, and as we have learned in the other films, they always disintegrate one at a time until he blows his top. Beverly D'Angelo returns to the character of Ellen Griswold, she pulls off the housewife/mother role quite believably; she is not nearly as bad as anyone would expect. Many people say she was in the first movie just to flash the screen a few times, but that's just from the mouths of people who dislike the movies; I think her role is important, and D'Angelo carries it well. The only other person I can think of that fits the Ellen character is Goldie Hawn, but that's probably because she acts a bit like D'Angelo so it is easier to imagine her as Ellen. The kids in this `Vacation' film are (finally!) older; Rusty is on the verge of manhood, and Audrey has matured as well. The things they get themselves into during the film are quite funny. Audrey becomes a Vegas dancer, and Rusty becomes a rich tycoon with the help from some `friends.' We splice back and forth to their predicaments during the film. One hilarious segment includes a bit where the Griswold family visits Uncle Eddie (a returning Randy Quaid) out in the middle of nowhere; he says that he got his land for free from the government because it used to be a nuclear test site (`I got tomatoes growing this big!'). Uncle Eddie is more disgusting than ever; he lives in a small trailer with about forty-something kids, all of which have strange deformations. In `Vegas Vacation,' Randy Quaid has the longest screen time that Eddie's ever had before, and I think this is a good thing. Perhaps some people thought it went a bit over the top with Eddie, but I say, `The more Eddie, the better!' Wallace Shawn makes a rather long cameo as the craps dealer; Clark has a vengeance built up against Shawn's character. He MUST beat him. However, Clark always loses and that is how he loses all his money. Wayne Newton takes a rather big role as well. He pretends to be in love with Ellen Griswold (`It's a lock of my hair.') in the film; he tries to steal her from Clark, who forgets to pay attention to his wife while he blows his money away like it's just paper and nothing more. John Hughes, writer of `Vacation' and `Christmas Vacation,' did NOT return to the keyboard for this one; someone else wrote it. I think, however, that the writer of `Vegas Vacation' wrote the script well; the jokes are plentiful and enjoyable. It's nowhere near as bad as some comedy sequels get (i.e. `Police Academy' sequels).Many people really hated `Vegas Vacation,' saying that is was just not funny. But no one can tell me they didn't laugh - or even chuckle - at this film. I understand that it is not as good as the first film, but to tell you the truth, I used to have a hard time choosing a favorite - the three films (`Vegas,' `Christmas,' and the original - NOT counting the `European' sequel) are so different and funny that it really is hard to choose. However, `Vegas' is more familiar to the first film than the sequel(s), and it's a bit easier to compare. When I look closely at them, I decide (a) the first film was a first, and no one had ever experienced Clark Griswold before; (b) the jokes are a bit better and (c) the cast was a bit younger back then and could go for more physical gags. In the new film, Clark swings over the Hoover Dam, and it looks like Chevy really strained himself doing some of the physical stuff (even if it means dangling over a green screen). All in all, I feel that `Vegas Vacation' is a very underrated comedy. I really, really enjoyed it, and had a fun time watching it. It's always nice to take another visit to the Griswold family, and I'm up for another sequel (perhaps John Hughes should write the next one?). 3.5/5 stars - "},{"Title":"Lots of FUN!!!","Date":"13 August 1999","Score":"11 out of 17 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  I thought that this one was the one of the best movies from the Vacation series.

Well , at least until the new remake of Vacation doesn't show up. It doesn't have the National Lampoons title , but it is the sequel to previous three movies. It was directed by Stephen Kessler. What is more important is that John Hughes (writer of all three movies) isn't the writer of this one. Vegas vacation was written by Elisa Bell and Bob Ducsay.It's hard to find a good third movie in the series , much less forth. It's also a risk to make a sequel to an 80's movie . Many of the sequels to 80's movies fails , because they aren't able to capture that specific 80's magic of the original (Another 48 hours , Beverly Hills cop 3, Blues brothers 2000 for example). Griswalds didn't really needed another sequel , since the third one was really good . So who needed it ? Chevy Chase . After the 1989 he wasn't able to make a successful movie and this was his last attempt to become a major star once more .In the end it's a movie that should have been made as straight to video flick . It is so bad , that it's worse than European vacation . At least I had few laughs with that bad movie , with this one I had none.Vegas lacks freshness . The writers tried to keep Vegas vacation in style of previous movies , but failed terribly. None of the usual Griswald charm is here . The jokes fell incredibly forced and don't work. Only SOME of the jokes with cousin Eddie APPROACH being funny (which doesn't mean they are , mind you). The franchise had simple , but funny , slightly raunchy sense of humor . This one is boring and bland like most of US sitcoms. It feels more like a commercial for Las Vegas than a comedy.The old cast is back &#x96; Chevy Chase , Beverly D'Angelo and Randy Quaid. The kids has been recast again . Ethan Embry plays Rusty and Marisol Nichols plays Audrey. I have to say they are my least favorite couple from the whole series. They give very flat performances.National Lampoon took their name off the title of this film. It's hard not to understand why. Surprisingly, Vegas Vacation was fairly successful at the box office, taking in almost $40 million (the budget mus have been low for this movie) Which meant there was yet another chapter in the saga, the even worse than this National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation 2- Cousin Eddie's Island Adventure.

The laughs are gut- bursting, and the hot Nevada desert is the perfect resort to capture just how zany and outrageous the Griswalds can be. Sure it's good to watch one in a blue moon, after seeing the same gags over and over again, it does loses its flavour like a piece of chewing gum and you can easily become bored after a while. The film is truly a follow-up to Christmas Vacation as Clark finally got his big bonus from his marketing business after his newly invented cereal bars are a success and decides to use his money to his advantage and brings his wife and kids with him where they'll go on a frenzy gambling and living the life on Easy Street. During their stay, the Griswalds venture on their own to see what fortune comes their way. Such scenes involves legendary crooner Wayne Newton trying to get it on with Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo). Clark and the kids have their moments as well. Sure the Griswald family follow the same path as the other three installments, but that's because of their inept ways of life, they have managed to make us laugh. We all come to see them struggle, fail and try to move up only to still remain left behind, but we love them for that and that is what keeps their fans from coming into theatres for. We were all shocked to see Clark as he dangles off Hoover Dam and crashing through Wayne Newton's house with the van.The movie is very rich because the film is unpredictable. You think that they slowed the tempo down in Christmas Vacation, but think again, the falls, the slapstick humour is still effective as we await for every gag to takes its shape and every way for the Griswalds to bend it. The laughs continue and never gets bored the first time seeing it at least, but after multiple viewing it loses its flavour like chewing gum. Clark and the gang had their moments of laugh-till-your-stomach- bursts moments, however, the funniest scenes will involve the funniest supporting player to the Griswold clan. I'm talking about Randy Quaid's Cousin Eddie. From the first and third installments (he wasn't in European Vacation), he was always a dynamic character and the reason why is that even though he's dumber than rocks, his heart is in the right place and looks out for Clark even in the the most dire situations. But his redneck ways and caring charm puts a light touch to someone's heart. This film isn't without its weaknesses. For one thing if you seen the other three Griswald adventures you seen them all. The madcap over- the-top slapstick humour has been done many times before and many times better. Even the dialogue and the facial expressions have all been executed in the very same pattern. But hey, what do I expect this film was going to be, a life-changing drama? Hell, no this is National Lampoon baby, so the film should be about overdosing in slapstick comedy so why spoil a good thing.Another fault is why was Wayne Newton playing a pivotal part in the film. Sure he's a respective singer and I would have been okay if he played a cameo role in the film. But as a supporting character, he was just plain awful. He was just playing himself, a sleazy Vegas singer who had the hots for Ellen.Usually in the other three films I laughed with the family, but in Vegas Vacation, I couldn't help but feel sorry for them, especially from the kids (who looked too old to play the parts of Audrey and Rusty). The lack of chemistry is missing in this film because the kids and the parents seem to go their own separate ways. I thought it angered me that Clark kept forgetting his daughter's name most of the time (making her feel like the black sheep of the family a la Meg Griffin from Family Guy). I also felt that there was a lot of parental negligence as the kids Audrey and Rusty found themselves in dangerous predicaments. It was also very angering that Clark spent over $23,000 of his bonus money on gambling when he should have done as he promised in Christmas Vacation was to install a swimming pool. It made me think where's social services when you need them feeling I got. Surely a family could not have been this dysfunctional. But though it all it still succeeds in providing you with non-stop gags and having you laughing the whole way through. Overall this movie is by far a terrible movie. The laughs are plentiful and you'll surely have a good time and Randy Quaid was wonderful as Cousin Eddie. I would recommend it as a comedy and really nothing more than that.

His wife, Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) and two kids, Audrey (Marisol Nichols) and Rusty (Ethan Embry) are called to a family meeting. In short order, Clark announces that his new formula for food preservation has garnered a big bonus and he is taking them all to Las Vegas. No one is very excited but they have little choice but to go along. When they arrive in town, the Griswolds take a limo to their hotel, although poor Audrey gets stuck in the moonroof, thanks to her dad. Before long, cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) shows up, for Ellen has called her cousin, Eddie's wife Catherine, to announce their visit. Eddie promptly watches Clark lose a whopping $300 bucks at the blackjack table, much to the joy of the sadistic dealer, Marty (Wallace Shawn). After the loss, Eddie invites everyone to his house north of Vegas, where the government has given him some lovely, parched, radioactive land. From there, its on to Hoover Dam and to a bunch of shows, including Sigfried & Roy and Wayne Newton. Newton, in fact, makes a play for Ellen in front of the audience, although Clark thinks its part of the act. While Ellen gets invited to have cocktails with Wayne, Clark goes on gambling and the kids, under age, get fake identifications so they can likewise play the tables (Rusty) and try out exotic dancing (Audrey). They even have an encounter with an old, old gambler (Sid Caesar). How will their great adventure end? This is the best of the vacation films, my opinion, even though all are enjoyable. The script is lively and inventive and so, so funny. The cast, too, is excellent, with the main folks reprising their long established roles, and Newton, Embry, Nichols, Shawn, and especially Caesar, adding greatly to the merriment. The scenery is the best of the strip, Eddie's abode notwithstanding, and the costumes and direction are topnotch, also. Do you, personally, need a vacation from the norm? VV is the cure for the anytime blues.

Las Vegas is a place that is already weirdly funny and crazy itself, so the fact that so few movies have been able to use Vegas to the best of its comedic potential is somewhat surprising. Out of all the Vegas comedies, Vegas Vacation is the strongest and most re-watchable. It's not even close to a perfect movie by any means, but it is quite enjoyable and a lot of fun to watch.As with all the other films in the 'Vacation' series, the biggest strength of Vegas Vacation is Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo. The two have always seemed like an unlikely couple, but they always have great chemistry together, and it's stronger here than in any of the other Vacation sequels. Chase is a master of broad, physical comedy and D'Angelo plays off his goofiness nicely. D'Angelo has always had the tougher role of the two; she has to balance showing her love for her husband while often being annoyed or angry at his shenanigans. This is a part that could have been portrayed as the nagging wife stereotype that's prevalent in so many comedies, though D'Angelo never even comes close to falling into the category with her performance in any of the movies. Vegas Vacation is probably her best overall performance in the franchise, as she is given much more to do and has one of the better subplots of the movie.One of the trademarks of the series is that Russ and Audrey are portrayed by different cast members in each film. Vegas Vacation is helped enormously by the fact Ethan Embry as Rusty and Marisol Nichols as Audrey are the most likable and natural of those who have played the characters. They seem like real kids here, which makes the film seem like a lot less cartoonish and stupid than it might have with lesser performers. Their reaction to Clark's kids, remember when you were babies? cracks me up every time. In a movie filled with memorable quotes, that line and Uncle Eddie's (Randy Quaid)where can I get some damn bait? line are the two best moments of the whole film.As much as I like Vegas Vacation, I'll be the first to admit it has a fair amount of scenes that just don't work. Clark swinging across the Hoover Dam remains not only the worst, most desperately unfunny scene of the 'Vacation' franchise, but maybe one of the worst out of any 90s comedy. It looks terrible, and is too dumb even in a franchise known for having a fair amount of stupidity. Additionally, the Siegfried & Roy scene has never been particularly funny either, though it's not painful to sit through.Vegas Vacation is the most family-friendly of the series (it's the only one to be rated PG), and while there are times when it seems like the filmmakers are actively trying to leave out the seedier elements of Vegas, it seems appropriate given that those elements would have clashed with the light-hearted tone the film has. Despite being a PG-rated sequel to the R-rated National Lampoon's Vacation and its PG-13 sequels, the film has the same overall feeling of the other films. The film doesn't really suffer from not being as raunchy as its predecessors.Vegas Vacation isn't the best 'Vacation' movie, or even the best 'Vacation ' sequel. It is, however, better than any almost any fourth installment in any franchise has any right to be. Though it's not an absolute classic like National Lampoon's Vacation, it is a very good comedy about Las Vegas, as well one of the more memorable comedies from the 1990s.

Heck, one of my friend's girlfriends was actually hit on and picked up by Wayne Newton. Yes you can cook meat on a rock on a hot day and every day in the Summer is a hot day. Rattle snakes radioactivity its all part of Las Vegas fun. This movie hits all of the highlights. Think of it as a travel log with attitude. Loved it.Cast is perfect. Chevy is the unflappable fool tourist who flops around as a fish out of water. Randy Quaid is the kind of guy who is right at home in Las Vegas and proud that his daughter is an entertainer But the person who makes it all work is Beverly who takes all the abuse and slyly sticks in her comments.

In this installment, Clark Griswold (Chase) takes his wife, Ellen (D'Angelo) and 2 kids, Rusty (Embry) and Audrey (Nichols) to Las Vegas, Nevada for a family trip. Clark runs into cousin Eddie (Quaid) while getting there and has bad luck. Newton plays himself who falls in love with Ellen and Clark starts getting himself addicted to gambling causing him to lose most of his money and his family starts going their separate ways. Soon, Clark tries to redeem himself and get his family back together. This is a pretty good, but long-waited sequel, Chevy is great as usual and I recommend this.

That couldn't be further from the truth. This is my second favorite in the entire franchise next to the original film. Vegas Vacation was watched by me countless times in the late nineties when I was very young, and really didn't know what the characters were discussing, or even saying for that matter. Along with Fools Rush In, this was my favorite film in my childhood.I recently ran into the National Lampoon's Vacation Collection on Amazon for about $25. What the hell? I'll pay that. I had already watched the first two, and really wanted to dive into the third and rewatch this (keep in mind, at the time, it had been around nine years since I had seen the film). I recently ran into it on Comedy Central, and there was the question again; what the hell? The Griswold Family returns to the screen, this time taking a family vacation to Las Vegas. While it isn't much of a family-friendly place, Clark (Chase) and Rusty (Embry) are more than happy to head there and have a damn good time. They even stop at Cousin Eddie's house (Quaid) for more fun, but soon enough, they wind up taking him to Vegas unexpectedly. Let the crazy, nonstop, unrealistic, comedy antics begin. Clark gambles away their money, the wife Ellen (D'Angelo) falls in love with Wayne Newton, Rusty gets a fake ID and wins big, and Audrey (played by the stunning and gorgeous Marisol Nichols) loosens up to become a dancer.It's nothing special, but back in the day, to a five year old, it was colorful, vibrant, jumpy, loud, and off it's own medicine. I loved it. I saw love at first sight when I saw Marisol Nichols play Audrey. Then when I grew older, I questioned if continuity was even brought up when making this sequel. The children look nothing like they did in the first three films. Rusty was an average looking guy, but in this one his a very handsome, grown individual. Audrey has the biggest change of all. She was the homely child in the first three, but in this one she's got black hair and is amazingly gorgeous. Puberty did her well.But who cares? The jokes are somewhat fresh, the scenes are classic (my favorite being the dam boring tour), and the characters return to give it their all once more. Hard to believe that this would be the last time we see these characters in the flesh until thirteen years later when Chevy and Beverly would appear in the short Hotel Hell Vacation. I suspected something like National Lampoon's Australian Vacation, But it was still nice to see them back at it one more time.Vegas Vacation isn't perfect. You could almost think of it has a hopelessly lost spin off that doesn't take too many new routes, or even has appropriately placed characters. It doesn't even have the National Lampoon's name in the title. My only theory is that Warner Bros. (the company that distributed every other Vacation film) wanted to make another film in the franchise. They probably suggested the idea of Vegas with high hopes, National Lampoon maybe scrapped it, and WB went on to do it by themselves with no endorsement of National Lampoon. After all, they do own a part of the name, might as well milk it.No matter, Vegas Vacation is a film I'm proud to call one of my favorite comedies, and my second favorite in the Vacation franchise.Starring Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, Ethan Embry, Marisol Nichols, and Randy Quaid. Directed by Stephen Kessler.

This time, the Griswolds again head west, but this time to Las Vegas, because Chevy Chase (who returns as Clark Griswold, alongside Beverly D'Angelo as his wife Ellen and Randy Quaid as Uncle Eddie) gets a bonus for developing a food preservative. Also, another funny tradition that is passed on from the previous movies is yet again new actors portraying the Griswold kids, Russ and Audrey.

What made this film great is the Las Vegas setting. The entire film was shot on location throughout Vegas in selected casinos, streets and surrounding locales. The authentic setting made this film extremely unique since most Vegas-related films are shot on soundstages.I have held this film in a high regard for its everlasting entertainment with the familiar trials and tribulations of the Griswold family. A confidant of mine pointed out a difference of this film that separates it from the preceding three. The difference being that the situations in `Vegas Vacation' are not typical of what a regular family could relate to.  His basis was that in the prior films, one could relate to an overcrowded house for Christmas, a ruined vacation overseas and making a cross-country trip to find your destination to be closed. The contrast to `Vegas Vacation' is the uncharacteristic occurrences of someone climbing the Hoover Dam wall, winning four cars from slot winnings and being wooed by a famous Vegas personality. Although those were the wordings of a close friend, and to be objective in my review, it does not sway my dedication and admiration of this `National Lampoons' classic.The cast compilation is excellent. Beverly D'Angelo and Chevy Chase obviously made their return along with their character-changing children (this time played by Ethan Embry and Marisol Nichols). Embry played a naïve and juvenile 'Rusty Griswold' while Nichols played a cute and sexy 'Audrey'. Randy Quaid and Miriam Flynn return as 'Cousin Eddie' and 'Cousin Catherine' whom, this time, just happen to live out in the middle of the desert-- just outside of Vegas. There are many small-part actors who made memorable appearances. Wendy Kaufman ('The Snapple Lady') played a jovial casino dealer while Wallace Shawn was the nemesis blackjack dealer to 'Clark Griswold'. Sid Caesar, Julia Sweeney, Christie Brinkley were some of the others who appeared while Wayne Newton, Siegfried and Roy portrayed themselves. A bit of unknown trivia is that the character, 'Jilly from Philly,' who took 'Rusty' under his wing, was played by Jerry Weintraub--- one of the film's producers.From the looks of the last five years, this may just be the last `Vacation' film. If Warner Bros. does happen to make another installment, hopefully it will be an exceptional film to end the series. One idea of mine for a storyline could be that the Griswold's take one last vacation as a family before 'Rusty' and 'Audrey' get married off.In closing, this 95-minute classic is a sure bet to win audiences over, especially the dedicated `Vacation' film followers. This is one film to own on DVD to keep in your collection.

The second film, Nation Lampoon's European Vacation, overdid it, and became crass and boorish. Christmas Vacation had hints of raunchiness mixed with holiday cheer in its winter blunderland, and pulled it off wonderfully, without going over the deep end. This installment eliminates any offensive material, and ends up being a diluted and watered down, PG- rated kiddie movie- but its setting in Vegas is completely alien to any kids who may watch this one, and its bland material will quickly bore the adults in the audience. Chevy Chase, who is said to be one of the biggest tossers in Hollywood (when he was still in Hollywood, anyway) takes the fourth incarnation of his family to Vegas, where the predictable low-jinks follows. His character slowly went off the deep end in Vacation, and Christmas Vacation, but here, it seems like he could hardly be bothered to do much of anything, other than stand around with a befuddled expression on his blubbery face. He seems to think nothing of swinging to his possible death on a broken power cable at Hoover Dam, in a ludicrously contrived vignette. At the end of that scene, everybody laughs, and they all just go along their merry way, as though nothing ever happened. The preceding monologue about the Hoover Dam will doubtlessly amuse those in the audience with an IQ of 6, but all others won't even crack a smile. Randy Quaid's funny character is brought back from Christmas Vacation, but is saddled with uninspired and unfunny material, as a desert- dwelling hick, and Christie Brinkley's cameo was far too self aware (are we really supposed to believe they would cross paths again, 14 years later, and remember each other?) Wayne Newton's cameo adds nothing but his name value; Marisol Nichols is cute, but neither she (as Audrey) nor the guy (as Rusty) have anything to work with either, and both seem a bit too old for their characters.

Randy Quaid tags along again this time as Cousin Eddie, but why the same kids as in the first movie couldn't be used here is beyond me! It seems like keeping the same cast together would help the film. However, it is good enough. Wallace Shawn as a Vegas dealer is as funny as always. Sid Caesar has a great cameo at the end as a Mr. Ellis, who gives the Griswolds his winning lottery ticket. Ironically, in the first film, Imogene Coca (Caesar's partner in his SHOW OF SHOWS back in the late 40's and early 50's) was cast as Aunt Edna. Here's Sid Caesar this time, and it's a pity he couldn't have lent his talents more to the rest of the film.This is one of those films that, despite its flaws, it seems to have a certain touch that makes it funny. It's a pleasure watching. And the whole thing was shot on location, so you get some great glimpses of Vegas throughout the film.Highlights include the Hoover Dam sequence, and the scene at Cousin Eddie's house.See this one when you get a chance. Don't expect quite the same as VACATION, but this really does come pretty close. A bit less offensive than the first film-it's rated PG instead of R, so it might be better for the family.

(Just so you're not mad, I said lesser, which means they were both laugh out loud funny, but not as hysterical as the first) The plot is non-existent, so there's no point in displaying it. Just know this, Clark (Chase) takes his beautiful wife Ellen(Beverly D'Angelo) and children to Las Vegas (surprise!!) to renew their wedding vows.  From there, things get messed up... I didn't laugh enough in this film, (if I laughed at all), but Randy Quaid did supply all of the chuckles. He's still a hoot as Clark's cousin Eddie.

But just hear me out, the best material they could come up with was Clark scaling the Hoover Dam...And what's with the PG rating? The first one was R and sequels PG-13.

Clark W. Griswold (Chevy Chase) got a big bonus for his long-life food preserver and decides to take his family, which includes his wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo, still looking hot after all these years), son Rusty (Ethan Embry), and daughter Audrey (Marisol Nichols), to fantastic Las Vegas! As one may think from a screwball movie, everything doesn't go as planned. In fact, it seems like this Vacation has the most mishaps out of any of them (maybe because it's situated in one place?).Clark develops a serious gambling problem, spending every last penny at the games, mainly at a blackjack table dealt by Marty (Wallace Shawn) who seems to connive to win the game. Wayne Newton, the popular entertainer, falls in love with Ellen (and she's a big fan of his). Rusty becomes an underage gambler and wins big. And Audrey becomes involved with the ways of her whorish cousin Vicki (Shae D'Lyn).But that's not all! Clark's (or Ellen's) cousins Eddie (Randy Quaid) and Catherine (Miriam Flynn) now live by Vegas, and no family member is going to not say hi. Actually, they get involved in all sort of crazy plots, most which don't seem plausible yet still crack me up.The outlandish scenarios seem to be what cause laughs. Who can't chuckle as Clark gets lost in Hoover Dam? I doubt anyone can keep a smile in when Clark and Eddie go to that `specialty' casino. All of them are quite hilarious, but still don't provide the caliber laughs that seem to come from the first Vacation. This has a fine cast, which also includes Sid Caesar, Julia Sweeny, Siegfried and Roy with `guest appearances'.Chase still seems to come out as Clark, taking all of the past jokes (forgetting about Audrey, yelling to Rusty when he's right there) and reusing them. They also get in a `good talk, son', even though that's not really as funny. The kids aren't the same throughout the four Vacations, even though Clark and Ellen stay the same. As said in the movie, `And you kids are growing up so fast, I hardly recognize you anymore!' I think I saw this one before any of the other three, so these images of the kids stay in my mind.Again, Quaid is down-and-out hilarious as the hick cousin. Wearing snorkels into a casino, asking a guy behind a buffet counter that he'd like `some of the yellow', and asking tour guides where he can get bait, Quaid has great comedic timing and seems to really enjoy doing these types of movies. Flynn underplays her role (and so does the script), and she should be better known. I really liked Sweeny in her role, albeit a small one. Caesar is great, too.Vegas Vacation is second best in the four movies (next to Vacation), and is should be seen by all, or at least most.My rating 7/10Rated PG for sensuality, language and thematic elements.

His last good movie was 1989's Christmas Vacation, which has more laughs in the first ten minutes than the entire duration of this film.

In each case, there was no compelling reason for the movie to have been made in the first place, and in each case, the final product ends up looking and sounding like exactly that, a product. Films such as these are not only awful, they are hard to concentrate on. There is the feeling when watching them that talented people should have known better, rather than signing away their reputations for a paycheck. Here, we get Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, and Randy Quaid, the principal stars of the hitherto entertaining 'Vacation' series reprising their roles for said paycheck. The film gets off to a good, fastpaced start, with things happening so quickly that we almost don't realize the movie has run out of gags and ideas by the time the Griswolds get to Las Vegas. Which is maybe ten minutes into the movie. From there, 'Vegas Vacation' becomes nothing more than a glorified travelogue for the famed gambling city. I honestly asked myself at one point, as Chevy Chase pops up during a performance by Siegfield & Roy in one of many laughless sequences, who produced this movie? The Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce? It's hard not to get that impression as the characters wander through the various hotels, show venues, casinos, and other touristy sites to no apparent good purpose, other than to showcase, well, Las Vegas. The scene at Hoover Dam is another prime example. It is an interminable scene with no laughs. Throughout the movie, Chevy Chase is given nothing funny to do, and he reciprocates by appearing to show up for his parts between holes of golf. (And he looks nothing like the trim, tuxedoed pic on the movie poster. They must have airbrushed forty pounds off him.) Beverly D'Angelo comes off best in her dalliances with Wayne Newton. The movie plods along, each scene as depressingly unfunny as the one preceding it. Surprisingly, 'Vegas Vacation' was fairly successful at the box office, taking in almost $40 million (it COULDN'T have cost much to make.) Which meant there was yet another chapter in the saga, the Chase-less, awkwardly titled, 'National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation 2- Cousin Eddie's Island Adventure.'

They should have left it there cos this belated sequel is a big step back in quality in both production values and script etc, but has none of the low budget appeal of the first films and is disappointing and embarrassing viewing. The formula is tired and Chevy Chase is looking a bit too old for this, and its the usual series of misadventures, but without any really good jokes. The first 'big laugh' is Clark trying to give his wife one in the airplane toilet and getting his foot stuck and getting the blue toilet water all over himself which makes you look at whoever you're watching it with and exchange a look which says this is going to be crap.  . It goes downhill from there, with bad set pieces such as Clark causing a leak on the Hoover Dam and swinging on a wire across it after getting somehow getting stuck outside on the face the dam. The only good bit is Randy Quaid as redneck cousin, which again is a poorer version of the jokes from previous films. It becomes clear that they had no budget for this when Wayne Newton who I assume is some big name Vegas singer gets to promote himself along with plenty of other crappy Vegas locations/shows. The low point is the result of some deal that the producers obviously cut with cheesy Vegas stage magicians Seigfried and Roy where they let them film a scene at their show in return of having a good few minutes of their stage show in the film. Recently Roy was mauled by one of the tigers and you wonder if it was in revenge for being forced to be in Vegas Vacation.

With the original writer gone (though at this point of the 90s he had lost his touch) all they could muster was this crapola script.  Basically this is a tour guide of Vegas attractions, as we see Siegfried and Roy, Wayne Newton, and the Hoover Dam instead of laughs. And Chases age is showing, with the worn face and gray hair, he's approaching a grandfather status if there is a fifth movie.  D'Angelo still looks pretty good, and Quaid has retained his goofy appearance. Theres bad humor attempts all the way, as  they try to get smiles from Audreys gut squeezed in a sunroof, or Rustys winning ways on the casino circuit.  The actors selected this time to play the kids are decent, as we get wide-eyed Embry and easily influenced Nichols.  The best casting desicion was to bring back Quaid, as he's the only one who supplies any smiles.  Only real strong gag is the one involving Brinkley, but otherwise avoid this tired flick.

Somewhere along the line, Mr. Chase stopped caring, and it shows.  That's what makes it so sad to see him waddle through this total crap-shoot of a sequel, the 4th in the Vacation series, and by far the worst.  Chevy doesn't have the spark that he was once so aptly nick-named for in the first film (the good one in the series). I once believed that we'd never see worse than the ultra-horrible European Vacation fiasco, but Vegas Vacation sinks to a new low.  A meandering, pointless, and all-around predictable plot-line all centered around Clark (Chevy Chase) and Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) getting themselves in and out of Clark's idiotic mishaps.  In some instances, including complete dialogue lifts, the film recycles  many of the jokes from the first film (for me the best part of the movie was the scene in which Christie Brinkley cameo's her character from the original Vacation film, in the same outfit, car and with the same music playing!).  Whereas Chevy used to play Clark as a somewhat clumsy wise- ass, now he is just plain stupid, and it's really sad to see; although not near as sad as Chevy's sleep-walking through the role completely.  And despite the fact that there is no plausible reason for perennial favourite Cousin Eddie to show up in the film, his character is the only one that really provides any laughs at all; sparse as they might be.  Everyone else is adequate, although their characters really aren't important to the story over-all.  (And however nice it was to see the cameo by Sid Caesar, it didn't work.)4/10.  I can only hope that going to Vegas was the last Vacation the Griswold's will ever take.

I love Chevy Chase, and this entire movie series is always a riot if you ask me.   In this movie--Clark Griswold has made some extra cash at work, and he decides to take his family to Vegas.  The laughs begin even before they arrive in the city, with Clark and Ellen getting totally drenched with blue toilet water on the plane...at the hotel when the receptionist tells Clark they have a wonderful dry cleaning service, he replies with-'oh, it's just a birthmark.  This starts the fun, and it never really stops until near the end of the film, which I think could have been done a lot better.  This movie has an awesome cast, with the guy--I forget his name--from Can't Hardly Wait, and the gorgeous Marisol Nichols as Audrey--who happens to be one of my favorite actresses (she's also on Showtime's original series, Resurrection Blvd.)  The movie brings back Quaid as cousin Eddy, and his crazy family, which includes his daughter who is a stripper.  It's a great movie, and a perfect addition to the Vacation series.  It might not be as funny as the others in the series, but it's worth a watch.

First, as of April 1999, IMDB says it rates a 5.7.  The original Vacation flick rates a 7.0.  Trust me when I say that this ratings difference does not nearly describe the difference in entertainment value.  Second, I was quite surprised that anyone would want to do yet another Vacation movie.  How long will this series drag out?  I suppose we should expect a weekly syndicated sitcom soon. I had the pleasure of catching this movie on a cable movie channel.  The only reason it keeps your attention is because you can't believe how lame it is.  Only the scenes with Randy Quaid approach funny.  The scene with Christie Brinkley is cute, but how many people will get the reference outside of the hardcore Vacation fans (if there is such a group). Do you remember when the USA network alternated Gilbert Gottfried and Rhonda (?) on Up All Night?  This movie is not good enough to be shown in that format. The only reason that I can imagine someone watching this movie is because it is being broadcast on television, and you like to have some noise in the room.

I could barely finish watching it. It was painful to watch this movie, especially for me since I'm a fan of the 'Vacation' series. This -- I am sorry to say -- made into my list of the top ten worst comedies.Same characters, same actors (except the kids) but a horrible result. I wonder why that is? The direction? Probably. The only funny character was Uncle Eddie, although he's not AS funny as in the past Vacation movies, he still lifts this disaster off the ground.There were many scenes that didn't make sense. Overall the acting was really bad (and I mean really really bad -again, comparing to the other Vacation movies)! It was just a big disaster. Some situations reminded me of a Bugs Bunny cartoon, although this seemed to luck the humor a cartoon has.I think I laughed no more than 2 times throughout the whole thing. Stephen Kessler made a disaster of what could have been another good addition to the Vacation series.

The real reason i sat down and watched this film is that i am off to Vegas myself in june , so i thought i would get a little taste of what was to come and in that respect this film was ok. it showed lots of Vegas sights and it did give me some idea of what to expect from the black jack tables. The film itself was poor, it tried to be funny and a couple of times i nearly smiled at a couple of the jokes. I have seen National Lampoons European Vacation and that was funny but you can't compare the two films , Chevy Chase should have stopped after the first couple of vacation comedies but as like a lot of comedies that have sequels ,Police Acadamy being the prime example,they dont know when to stop. 4 out of 10.

This flick comes nowhere near it's original best (Wally World) Vacation, but has it's moments like all movies.

I've never seen a Chevy Chase movie in which I hated his character more than in this one. Not only is he greedy, but he's downright ignorant, mulish and just plain stupid. Okay, okay, he is stupid in most of his movies, but this one is the topper. Clark W. Griswold deserves to be divorced, taken to the cleaners and left standing in the middle of the desert with no means of escape, and no hope of rescue. Ever.Again, totally NEW Rusty and Audrey. Though the original oldest female cousin (Eddie's daughter) is back, and she's the biggest whore in Vegas. Suspension of reality has to take place in all of the Vacation movies, but this one really pushes it. Shoves reality right off the highest roof of the highest building on the Vegas strip.I hated this latest installment of the Vacation series. Audrey becomes a wanton slut, Rusty becomes a ...well, Rusty was always like that. Ellen is now a wanna be slut and Clark loses any and all traces of lovability.Avoid it at all costs, if you are a fan of these movies.

It may be because the movie doesn't really have an idea what to do with the Griswold's in this location. (The original idea for this sequel was to have the Griswold's stranded on a desert island - an idea that has more comic potential.) And it's not just Chase who is lost - the actors playing the kids look attractive and seem to have talent, but with nothing to do, they give horrible performances.The main sin Vegas Vacation commits is that it's simply not funny. Not only do most of the gags fall flat, there aren't many of them in the first place - minutes go by without an attempt at humor.Randy Quaid and Wallace Shawn bring the only amusing parts to the movie. The movie is also the most colorful-looking of the four - the colors are very warm and attractive - but the movie has a look one usually associates with TV productions. "}]
