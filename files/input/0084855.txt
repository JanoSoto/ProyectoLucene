[{"Title":"Newman amazing as drunken lawyer in story of redemption...","Date":"10 March 1999","Score":"82 out of 92 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  The title of this movie is deceiving.  THE VERDICT suggests a courtroom drama, something like TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, or INHERIT THE WIND.  It does have some riveting court scenes, but what happens outside of court and to Paul Newman is the real attraction here.  The title not only refers to the inevitable decision of the important case of the film, but also to how the Newman character is going to live the rest of his life. Should he sell out and take the easy settlement, or take the highly regarded archdiocese of Boston to court for real justice.  These are the questions Newman must face in this profound drama that seems more like a picture of the 70's than an 80's film.Director Sidney Lumet has dealt with the legal system before in his first film, 12 ANGRY MEN.  He takes it to a more personal level and Paul Newman, one of the finest actors of the past 40 years, is the person to do it.  He is a legend and he bares his soul as attorney Frank Galvin, a lonely, corrupt drunk whose license to practice law is hanging by a thread.  Jack Warden plays his trusty assistant who gets him a case that could help Frank change his life.  Warden, however, has had enough.Newman plays an excellent drunk, even cracking an egg into an 8am beer to start his day.  This is a dim looking movie, shot during a cold winter in Boston.  There are no great shots, or even any emotionally-rousing speeches, but this is Lumet's style.  It is plodding and we see into the life of a lawyer on the ropes.  James Mason is perfect as the slimy defense lawyer. Newman is constantly underestimated because of past failures. He is a drunk, but he still has some tricks up his sleeve.NOTE Look closely at the closing argument given by Newman.  In the background, you can glimpse a then-unknown Bruce Willis.

Of course much of what happens in the movie is unrealistic and wouldn't happen in a real case but the movie isn't a study in courtroom procedure (watch the fantastic Anatomy of a Murder for that) it is a study about redemption and in that respect it excels.This movie captures Paul Newman's finest screen performance and that alone makes it an important movie. The scenes where Newman hardly says anything show how great an actor he is---his look of self-loathing when he's thrown out of the funeral home, his palsied hand and lost look when he's trying to drink his whiskey, his panic when Charlotte Rampling lambastes him for being a failure. Then throw into that his terrific courtroom scenes, his arguments with the judge in chambers, it is just a sensational performance all around.The level of acting is high all around in this movie. James Mason was Oscar nominated for playing the silky smooth, totally corrupt defense attorney. Jack Warden shines as Frank Galvin's world-weary former law partner. Lindsey Crouse has a small role as a nurse but is given the most powerful and dramatic moment in the entire movie. Her cross-examination by James Mason is where the movie really shines and shows that Paul Newman can keep his ego in check. How many movies give the most powerful and dramatic moment of the film to one of the secondary players? How many lead actors would be willing to just sit there quiet in a chair while a bit player and the second male lead share the big moment? It was a bold decision by both Newman, director Sidney Lumet and writer David Mamet and it is unforgettable.The movie shows the two extremes of the practice of law. James Mason's win-at-all-costs cheating and Paul Newman getting so emotionally wrapped up in the case that he is no longer protecting his client's interests and instead is out to settle his own personal scores. A great, great movie.

Each time, it gets better.   This is no doubt the best acting by Paul Newman in his career.   Why he didn't get the Oscar for this role, but instead got it for the lackluster The Color of Money, is beyond me.  The movie is actually about redemption, or the attempt to be redeemed.His interpretation of Frank Galvin, a desperate, conniving, down-to-the-last-case attorney, is fascinating and totally convincing.   And he has a fantastic supporting cast -- from Jack Warden as his partner, Charlotte Rampling as his chance for romantic redemption, Milo O'Shea as the corrupt judge, Lindsay Crouse as his surprising ace-up-his-sleeve, and most of all, in a landmark supporting actor role, James Mason as the seemingly distinguished and respected defense attorney.And I found the direction by Sidney Lumet to be, once again, outstanding.   Lumet has such a long list of great movies that you wonder why he has never won an Oscar or been given an AFI Lifetime Achievement award.  This is a riveting movie -- about the law, but mainly about the flawed nature of the human beings who are entrusted with it.   Please hear Newman, as Frank Galvin, on his last, crippled, despairing leg, give the summation to the case.   It needs to be carved in marble somewhere. David Mamet, who wrote the screenplay, deserves accolades for how he was able to hand Paul Newman such a moving summation.  The summation is about life, not just the law.  It is a masterpiece, worth seeing the entire movie for.Most of all, it is Newman's Finest Hour.

It is amazing what of the film I retained in memory. Most of what I remembered was the sheer brilliance of Paul Newman. In seeing it the second time, I'm 24 years older, I've worked for attorneys, I've had an experience with the justice system. And still, what I take away from The Verdict is the sheer brilliance of Paul Newman. After Matthew McConnaughey made A Time to Kill, he asked his agents if he could meet Paul Newman. I guess someone told him they were similar. Newman said to him, This is a time to not take yourself seriously and your work very seriously. When Matthew McConnaughey has a 50+ year career, you'll talk (I'll be gone) - but it's evident that Paul Newman takes his work very seriously indeed.The Verdict is an old story - the drunken attorney who takes a case -think The People Against O'Hara for one - but this one has a stunning cast which includes Jack Warden, James Mason, Charlotte Rampling and Lindsay Crouse. And it asks one of life's great questions - what do you do when losing is just not an option? Drunken, disillusioned, ambulance-chasing Frank Galvin takes a slam-dunk hospital negligence case thrown to him by an investigator friend (Warden). His expert witness tells him he can win. So Galvin doesn't tell his client about a lowball offer, takes the thing to trial, loses his star witness, hires a pathetic expert, is reported by his client for failing to give them the offer they would have happily taken - simply put, there's no paddle but if he doesn't get down the river, any hope of reconstituting his life is over. Gone. David Mamet's script stacks everything against Frank but when you're fighting for your life, failure is not an option.Newman is a wonder with his loser posture and hyperventilation and his desperateness. It's in his voice, it's on his face, it's in his smile, it's in his shaking hands. He's up against James Mason and his huge law firm, a smug, well-dressed bunch who will stop at nothing to win. One might think this type of firm is a clich√©; it isn't. One of the characters says it best - You have no loyalty to anyone, you don't care who you hurt. You're all whores. Unfortunately in real life, all attorneys are pretty much the same, but at least in film we occasionally are shown a decent one. When this film was made, the public had not yet been subjected to the Dream Team, the Robert Blake Case, the Menendez Brothers. But even today, knowing better, you can't help but buy into Newman's frantic sincerity.The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent, with top honors going to Mason's smooth Concannon and Lindsay Crouse, who gives us the most powerful five minutes of the film with her magnificent performance as the admission nurse.Is it a manipulative film? As hell. Is it feel good? You betcha. But take it from someone who knows an unfortunate truth - that justice is for the rich who pull in favors and have the money to fight, everyone lies their teeth off, and the jury system is sad - if I can be swept away by The Verdict and by Paul Newman's performance (another Oscar he was cheated out of) - you're gonna eat it up.

His Frank Galvin is not the noblest of creatures, he's a once promising attorney now an alcoholic ambulance chaser. But the skills are still there and he shows them battling tremendous odds. Thirty years earlier Frank Capra could easily have made this the subject of one of his populist dramas.Newman gets great support from an outstanding cast. James Mason, Jack Warden, Charlotte Rampling, Joe Seneca deliver some outstanding performances. The one I particularly liked here was Milo O'Shea as the corrupt and biased judge. Most of the great courtroom dramas have been about criminal cases.

I think the Academy realized their error and Newman's win for The Color of Money was really for his portrayal of Frank Galvin, in this well-done tale of moral decrepitude and ultimate redemption.  Writer Mamet and Director Lumet are into heavy symbolism throughout, with the scene of the developing Poloroids of the victim (the case becomes clear in Galvin's mind), to Galvin's pilfering of a woman's mail to run down a lead on a potential witness. The closing statement of Newman's character to the jury is powerful.

It's hard to pick a best work from Sidney Lumet, Paul Newman or David Mamet, but this film ranks up there for all three.   And really, when you say those three names on one film, that says it all, doesn't it?Newman plays a down and out lawyer, a drunk ambulance chaser whose life changes when he turns down a pultry settlement offer to try a case that he can't possibly win.  There are so many great scenes in this film, it's hard to pick a favorite. Possibly, the very end, the ringing phone Paul Newman ignores as he sips on some coffee, rather than whiskey, might be one of the all time greats.  The scene sums up the movie so well. My other favorite is a long, single shot where Newman is on the phone trying to get another doctor to testify and Jack Warden paces the room. The camera is at the other end of the room, on the floor and the scene is about five or six minutes long, one continuous shot, beautifully done.I read a book a couple years ago that covered blunders in film regarding court cases and apparently there were a couple in this one.  But this is a film that is so great, so well done, I think Godzilla could have trampled part of Boston and Lumet could have made it believable. Although Cool Hand Luke is my favorite film of all time, The Verdict is my second favorite Newman film. See it if you can.

The acting. Well, first of all, nobody is bad. The most nearly negligible performance is by Wesley Addy, who at least looks the part of the elegant doctor and who is a competent actor. The other principals are outstanding. Charlotte Rampling with that odd face -- sultriness imposed kicking and screaming upon boniness -- is unusually good and even manages to project a kind of believable guilty remorse, which has never been her strong suit. James Mason is (almost)unflappable as Concannon, attorney for the defense. Marvelous, the way he puts quotation marks around the word expert while questioning the plaintiff's witness. Edward Binns is stolid as the savvy but moral bishop who wants to wrap things up without making waves. What is the truth?, he asks Newman. Jack Warden is plumply likable, as always. He's seems to have aged more than Binns, with whom he'd worked a quarter of a century earlier in Twelve Angry Men. Lindsay Crouse in a small but crucial role is appealingly Irish. Milo O'Shea is sliminess itself. I don't know why, perhaps his impish accent, but there is always something amusing about him, as if unable to quite shake what Erving Goffman called role distance, the knowledge that he's playing a part accompanied by an awareness of the absurdity of doing so. Even Bruce Willis is in this, playing a visitor to the courtroom. I was an atmosphere person in a Boston courtroom too, in From the Hip -- a far superior movie. (Ask anybody. Ask my mother.) And Paul Newman is flawless. Robert Redford was supposed to play Frankie Galvin, but he wouldn't have been up to the part. The role requires the compelling anguish that Newman brings to it, and he does it perfectly. Redford is much too cool for that. I will mention just one scene of Newman's that is emblematic. He stands in his darkened office -- Warden watching soundlessly from the background -- and calls the defendants' law firm about a settlement they have already withdrawn. He paces around talking into the phone, hardly able to breathe, congested with not just mucous but self hatred, cajoling them, pounding on the desk with his knuckles, filled with an empty bravado. Redford couldn't do it. Practically nobody could do it.Almost everything fits together perfectly in this film. Sidney Lumet opens with a shot of Newman alone in silhouette playing a pinball machine in a Boston bar, drinking beer. The pinball game serves as a token for the trajectory of his life during the course of the film. Wardrobe first-rate. How New England. Multi-layered dark clothing, (in Newman's case black), woolly and fussy. Sound excellent. Little noises, hardly noticeable, form almost a background score. The old wooden floors creak when people step on them. An example of one or two good creaks the scene in Concannon's office when he is welcoming Laura back to the law. Twirled-up telephone lines squeak when someone pulls on them. The tinkling of ice cubes in liquor glasses. The heavy breathing of nervous or defeated people. The slamming of ancient desk drawers. Garbage trucks groaning and whining in the city streets at dawn. Production design as good as it gets. Everything looks old, as if it has been used and lived in for years, not shabby but burnished with age, all mahogany wood and scarlet carpets. Lighting and photography up there with the best. Most scenes are dark -- it's midwinter in Boston -- but not too dark, cleverly lighted. The snow in the streets is literally blue, as if it had just leaped out of an impressionist landscape. Tree branches glisten with moisture on slick night-time streets. Tinsel draped along a bar ceiling twinkles with fraudulent joy. The weakness? The movie is so good I hate to mention it, but the script leaves something to be desired. It almost betrays the characters. I don't mind the legal absurdities so much. Okay, so things would never really happen this way. The judge would have to grant a continuance and so forth. It's not so much that as the motivation and the set speeches that are bothersome, especially Newman's, and they're critical. The banter and small talk are fine. But Newman's conversion from a drunken, cynical ambulance chaser to a principled attorney of reawakened morals in the course of two-minute photo session with a comatose patient is patently unbelievable. Where did all that conscience (if that's what it is?) suddenly come from? He flops backwards as if stunned. Why? The script does its best to back up his epiphany. The images of his patient develop as a real person, not just a dollar sign, on the Polaroid photos, a mirror image of what's going on in his mind. But as Warden repeatedly points out, his job is to win some money for his clients so they can leave their comatose sister in good care and get on with their lives in Tucson. Instead he turns down the church's offer because he sees a trial as a challenge to his personal pride, as a means of redemption. (Is that kind of pride a mortal or a venial sin?) He loses sight of what the whole legal process is about because of this self-involvement. It wouldn't be so bad if he realized this but in fact he never gives it a thought.Finally, Newman's summation it sounds as if it had been put together by some high school kid whose homework assignment was to write an essay (of at least two hundred words) about what life means to me. I believe there is justice in our hearts, says Newman, more to himself than to the jury. No kidding.None of this criticism can subtract from all the other virtues of the film. It's among the best of its kind.

One might almost think the way he keeps the camera on a character or goes for the shots keeping the characters far away (long-shots) or in dark spaces (when not in the courtroom) or seemingly small in the scope of the areas around then, as detached. It is, but there-in lies his talents as a director, by letting the acting- slow but very sturdy and all based on David Mamet's script (also not one of his very best, but then again different from his plays). It's not a great film by the director as some have gone to lengths to write about, but it is one that is resonating further as I write this, and does successfully dig into further what it means to be a lawyer, or just trying to live, when odds are stacked against you. I'm almost reminded of a European director here, searching under the obvious in the story- points of which in the case that could just as well be on an OK episode of Law & Order- doing more of a character study than a full-on courtroom drama.It helps, however, that Paul Newman is at the top of his game here, giving a performance that is textured, if that's a word to use as well, and kind of sad. He's playing Frank Gavin as much of a tragic figure as a real human being here, and there's a scene where he is in his office at a big moment of doubt there is no other case, there is no other case. Newman is able to tap into what Lumet and Mamet have in the material superlatively, as if he knows how this character thinks. The early scenes show him as a low-level guy, ambulance chaser, who gets a case of a malpractice of a woman. In one of the most crucial and successful scenes in the film (for both director, writer and star), Gavin takes a couple of Polaroids of the girl in the hospital, seemingly just doing his work, but then has a pause, and the photos come into focus. This kind of change-of-thought has been done in other dramas to be sure, but here it really clicks with the pace, the mood and timing from Newman, and how this situation is given room to breathe.If the rest of the film doesn't follow this same pattern it's not necessarily a full-on crutch. The courtroom scenes themselves are very good, with James Mason (among other British character actors) convincing in their roles of the more 'weighty' side of the court. Jack Warden adds some presence too as Gavin's partner (and adds a memory of Lumet's own classic 12 Angry Men). Only the sub-plot between Newman and Rampling seems just slightly off. Her character is necessary for the film, and there are one or two excellent scenes with her in it (particularly the one with him feeling most shaky before the trial). But her part is that of a more conventional picture, and her motivations are only made so clear as to not be totally believable. The final scene between her and Newman is maybe the best out of all of them, but it goes without saying that it's mainly a credit to him and Lumet, a kind of catharsis that is laid on that does add a fine point.The Verdict is not really one of those films that is over-rated in the scope of things, and it's possibly more of the deserved Oscar nominated turns for Newman when compared to The Color of Money (good, not great there). It's worth seeing again, even as it is a different kind of courtroom picture, where the good and evil in man is not as revealed as in Lumet's first feature, but there are some poignant scenes of the need of redemption for a broken person.

The man himself doesn't do too much wrong giving one of his better performances as a lawyer on his way spiraling down clinging on to the one case that drains his moral conscience.Frank Galvin (Paul Newman) a lawyer on the verge of financial and career crisis latches on to a case of medical malpractice against a prestigious hospital and rejects an offer for settlement though he doesn't have enough firepower to go for a trial against the will of the kin to the victim. He befriends Laura (Charlotte Rampling) who is budding a budding legal counselor and finds some hard truths.Paul Newman portrays a man in depression who sees no way up from the position he is in but wants to stick by some ideology he never followed through his career. So the basic character structure is quite inconsistent which is why I couldn't relate to it in the first place. Sidney Lumet is a master of screenplay with his superior '12 Angry Men' and 'Dog Day Afternoon', but never really gets going here with uneven pacing and misdirected direction occasionally. Performances are top-notch throughout.Uneven pacing and unrelatable protagonist didn't work for me, but features an excellent performance by Paul Newman.

The movie succeeds despite its slightly worn story line--the down and out lawyer with an alcohol problem takes on the case of his life against all the odds. But it's a story where you know whose side you have to be on. The well-financed opposing lawyer is a brilliant James Mason. And there is Charlotte Rampling, sharp and stoic, on the fringes, a bit mysterious and maybe underused, but a key player in one way that can't be talked about until you've seen it.You might say this is an old-fashioned film. It's methodical, building up our sympathy, making the characters believable. It's not filmed with any real panache, but visually the job gets done, and so we focus on the events, and the acting. Indeed, we often focus just on Newman, who is intense without overdoing it, pulling out some of his best subtle, moody brooding and even angst. Boston, as the backdrop, is refreshing. You end up just enjoying getting sucked into the scenes and watching as the courtroom battle gets under way, with its inevitable twists.

Lumet does the same thing he does with 12 Angry Men in this film, he simply, without any tricks or fancy work expose us to the flaws of the law and justice, and how the rich nearly always gain the upper hand, but not always as this film shows. As Frank Galvin (Newman) says the court gives the poor and powerless a chance and sometimes they can walk out with something.Paul Newman proves in 'The Verdict' why his name stands amongst the Hollywood elite; his performance is truly magnificent. He plays a drunk, divorced, washed up Boston lawyer with a losing streak who gets a second chance to redeem himself. His boss/partner brings him a case so easy to settle out of court that he could make a bunch of money and not worry about a thing; about a Boston Catholic Hospital who administered the wrong anaesthetic to a young woman and destroyed her life; she is in a coma; deprived of speech, sound and vision. Galvin visits the Catholic bishop in relation to St. Catherine's hospital for a quick settlement, but on his way there he goes to see the girl; he sees the pain, destruction of a life... Galvin rejects $210,000 ($70,000) which would go straight in his pockets. Why? He can't be paid off to look the other way while a girl is paralysed and dying on a hospital bed. He takes them to court, despite disbelief from both the opposition and the judge himself.The story follows, as the powerful, defence attorney team rattle Newman's cage, through a variety of ways, leaving him with no ideas; but he fights, he does not surrender, he has a truth to fight for, he wants real justice, he wants redemption, and he gets it eventually... He wins the case not on masterful inquisitiveness of the law, but working as a decent human being relying on the humanity of the jurors to see beyond all the smoke and mirrors of the defence...The Verdict has great qualities; its the kind of film that is cathartic, satisfying while entertaining and superbly acted.9/10 "}{"Title":"By today's standards this is a MASTERPIECE OF FILM-MAKING -- and it's good too!","Date":"23 January 2009","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" By today's standards this is a truly GREAT FILM!

Forgetting the problemmatical legal inconsistencies (of which I had to be told and really don't care) the film succeeds on the levels it is supposed to, namely, characters, actors, and compelling nature of the drama (as if one can be separated from the other!) Jack Warden, brilliant in whatever he touches, may be America's most under-rated actor, is his usual brilliant here. His timing, his humor, his natural, easy manner make his character riveting and always interesting; he dominates every scene he is in, even with Newman. You can't take your eyes or ears off him.But when he's not there, there's still plenty. Like Newman's finest screen role. There are times when an actor is given the opportunity to do a role that is perfect for his age and experience, and this seems to be one. Frank Galvin has suffered, has loved and lost, and now, has stood for something and been beaten up for it, and is ready to be somehow, miraculously, redeemed. Newman, drawing on whatever life lessons he has experienced, and his innate acting skills, paints Galvin perfectly--you cannot help but love, pity, and root like hell for the poor guy. You can smell the alcohol on his breath. You can feel the discomfort of his clothes that he has not changed in weeks, and you experience the pain of his losses. But, when he wins, you win. More accurately, when he wins, the world wins.James Mason...enough said. Thank God for actors like this.Charlotte Rampling didn't know she had this in her.

We are surprised by how strict he can be in his behavior and belief systems during the case he takes. He is intently alert, always putting his own needs ahead of any responsibility to others. A lonely man, he stays far from the maddening crowd. For him, life is a burdened practice, not to be wasted away idly, which is precisely what is happening to his life as the film opens, finding him going from funeral to funeral attempting to con the bereaved into believing that he knew the deceased loved ones and wants to make sure they're represented by someone who cares. Every day he gropes drunkenly to apprehend it and wring as much profit as he can.The reason such a premise works so well is because of the wisdom and mechanics of David Mamet's writing. The internal problem that begins the story, which is an adaptation of a bestselling novel by American trial lawyer Barry Reed, Newman's hopelessness, is succeeded by the external predicament, the highly lucrative case which embodies all the murky details of medical, clerical and legal procedure. Jack Warden, Charlotte Rampling and James Mason are introduced, and our hero Paul Newman finds himself with the decision to fight all- encompassing immorality, for which he is no match, or to accept it, which screams with the practical leverage he needs to get his life back together. He rejects to take the juicy settlement, which compels us into the upsetting second section of the film.Like many traditional stories after the turning point, this one splits into two parts, the arrangement and the decisive moment at which the outcome seems to be clear. Mamet constructs his scenes so that they correspond to the arrangements for the trial, juxtaposing the enormous legal cart James Mason is mounting, under whose wheels devotees would throw themselves to be smashed, counter to the disorganized, hit or miss undertaking Galvin's running. Characteristically, the stronger the opponent and the weaker the hero, the more pungent the drama and the more severe the ascending friction.At the point at which things are at their lowest, the scenes have amassed in a callous, inescapable direction. The only element that seems to come from left field is the signature Mamet revelation, which is held back from Newman but not from the audience. It's delicate letting the audience ahead of the hero, because it takes the big chance of making the hero out to be misunderstood by us as stupid, but Mamet had no other place to set the scene, one that if you are familiar enough with his work can clearly see that he could not help but use, and skillfully uses it to make things seem even gloomier to us than they do to the protagonist. It generates sympathy for him, not condescension.The Verdict is a tribute to classic structure, which determines that character is plot. Ideally, if you're going to have a character arrive on the scene in a story long enough to tell someone how to go to the bathroom, this individual had better be full enough that we can almost assume where they were before the story happened upon them.Not one scene is needless or redundant. It is film composition at its most succinct, with each scene leading crisply and unavoidably into the next with a story development that is hardnosed in its importance. Sidney Lumet's old-fashioned sense of being a movie director has served him well, especially early in his career, as he hides the presence behind the camera and manipulates what is in front of it and how long it takes to show it. He leaves the gist of things to the screenwriter. His masterpiece Network was one of the few films one can truly say was a writer's movie. Frankly, I think The Verdict is also a writer's movie, because Lumet's perspective of film direction is letting the writer create the story so that the director can tell it.A true testament to this is that Lumet conserves the essential task of a movie, a succession of images contrasting so that the difference between them triggers the story to broaden within the position of the viewer. Once we get the point of a scene, whether the action within it is finished or not, the film moves on. This is precisely what Mamet would come to do when he began directing his own films.

Frank Galvin, played by Paul Newman, is an alcoholic, and not an anonymous one at all. He nearly was debarred for it. He has a case that has all characteristics of a lost case. It is against well considered doctors, even authorities in their field, working for a Catholic hospital and ruining the life of a pregnant poor woman by sheer negligence, and then trying to cover it up by making the admitting nurse in the delivery room perjure herself and falsify the admittance document. The point is that this nurse is covered by the other nurse in the operating room and the first nurse has been forced to resign from her position and even her profession, then move out of the state of Massachusetts to get another job. The trick in this court case is that the judge is hostile to Frank Galvin and yet somewhere in his mind he has some kind of sense of justice. He will emphasize the testimony of that fired nurse when accepting the objection of the defense counselor and having the testimony struck off the record. And the jury will of course have heard and will of course keep in mind that testimony and the defense will lose their case, and the doctors will be found guilty of negligence and Frank Galvin will win the case for the sister of the wasted patient and that sister's husband. We should rethink jury justice because there are too many cases where the jury is not just at all and then there are enormous numbers of appeals, and even some executions of innocent people. Some may say that jury justice is the least bad system, and we should consider that is not good enough. The appeal procedures should be reexamined and no irreversible sentence, like the death penalty, should be allowed of any crime at all. Better have a criminal rot in jail than an innocent person executed. All documents whatsoever have to be admissible in court, especially since if a testimony is refused in one court it can never be used again in any other court. Then we have to find procedures to verify and validate testimonies or documents, but they must not be crossed out, especially by one single judge on the basis of eventually one other anterior judge's decision. Jurisprudence is also fine and dandy but there too there should be some fair and just procedures to assess such elements and their validity in any posterior case. This film is a great film that shows all the short comings of jury justice even if the outcome is positive. It is rarely so, or it is too often the reverse.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr√©teil, CEGID "},{"Title":"One of the Best; A Classic.

Now it's time to share a few thoughts. First, Newman is always good...but this is different. This is no Slap Shot or The Sting Newman; he is perfect in his role as Galvin, and deserved the Oscar. I really can't think of a bad performance, or scene, in this film. If I had to pick one, I'd single out Lindsay Crouse...she always seems to come across as wooden...here she shows some emotion, but her timing and delivery take away from it. So, Paul Newman is at his best here, as is James Mason (a devilish best). The movie is about redemption, reward, conscience, power, money, The Church, the system...and how a hopeless lawyer somehow has his lightbulb moment...and against all odds does the right thing. That Lumet went with the original script/screenplay makes one wonder what the OTHERS were like, but everything in this film, the story, the characters, the lighting, the underlying plot(s) come together to make one of those perfect movies. After 17 viewings the only bad thing I can say is that I felt the titling (though perfect in its sense of movement and delivery) could have been better (the Old English Script seems over-the-top). But even the TITLES demand watching...Newman nursing a beer, playing pinball, dark lighting, all we see and hear is Newman and the sound of the pinball machine as the opening credits roll...then we fade into the film. You've got to see this movie at least once; go back again and catch some of the other things going on. This is what film-making is all about; an excellent cast, script, and situation. They don't make them like this anymore (although The Shawshank Redemption comes close). I give this one 10 stars; it should be required viewing for aspiring attorneys so that they never lose the human side of things.

You lose your job, your wife leaves you, you start drinking, you can't have another job back and like that, you're labeled as a failure, a loser. Frank Galvin, played by Paul Newman, is one of them. A loser. A Boston lawyer, he became what they call an ambulance chaser. A man who gives you a card during your father's funeral to tell you he was a friend of him. The first scenes of Lumet's The Verdict clearly announces the character as a man who's not your typical Paul Newman's character, he's no Hud, no Cool Hand Luke, no Eddie Felson, yet it's one of the most brilliant and masterful performances from the late actor.Frank Galvin hasn't solved a case in years. He hasn't won anything. He developed a 'brilliant' reputation that totally discredited him in the profession. Obviously, something must change in his life and Galvin, although not much appreciated, has one true friend  Mick, played by the late Jack Warden, who manages to get him a golden case to get back on the rails. A guaranteed win if Galvin accepts. He does, but for selfish reasons, at least at first. He cares for people, he cares for the case, but something is burning inside him he cares for himself. There is a profound desire of redemption calling from the bottom of his soul, he tries to find the right way and this case is the promised land for him. A young mother condemned to coma for the rest of her life, for what appears to be a medical error. Obviously, Galvin can't fail.BUT. What is failure? and what is success? That's the genius of the film. When Galvin takes snapshots of the poor victim, he realizes one thing he didn't quite get at the beginning. She's a victim of a criminal injustice. It's clear. Any other thing is a lie, any other attempt to silence the truth is criminal, and anyone who accepts that is accomplice. Anyone who accepts anything he believes against, whether because it is untrue or unjust, is a weak. The weak is the one who doesn't believe in his own principles, by not following them. The weak can win if he joins the liars, the cheaters, the winners, to win by default, but he'll always be weak, because he doesn't believe in himself, and will forever live with that. There's no salvation for the weak even if he wins. Galvin might be a loser, but he's not weak. Galvin is flawed, indeed. He has many weaknesses, alcohol being the biggest one, but his evolution all through the movie is a great example of an inspiring character study, from the brilliant director, Sidney Lumet (who, in 1982, had an already impressive and qualitative filmography). Galvin shows how justice is an abstract but powerful idea that can only live through our deep faith in our success in the quest for truth, because what is true, implies justice. Justice's blindness is a noble concept except when the blindness is deliberate. That is corruption, blinding justice, disguising it, using influence to silence it. Galvin despises this kind of corruption, refuses the generous offer from the opposite side, who like the people he defends, doesn't want a trial and prefers an out-of-court settlement. But HIS mission is personal, though he doesn't fight for selfish reasons anymore, but for his idea of justice. And hell yes, they'll go to trial.It's quite ironic that the movie lost the Best Picture Award to Gandhi, when Galvin is almost a Gandhi-like figure when you examine his ideas and beliefs. Everything is against him, yet he believes he's right. Gandhi said Even if you are a minority of one, the truth is the truth, this is Galvin's spirit. He believes in himself, he's given a mission that will redeem him, by bringing justice to the unfortunate couple, to a family devastated by the loss of a young woman. In this case, the opposite side is defended by the powerful, suave, charmingly villainous, Ed Concannon, brilliantly portrayed by James Mason. Concannon practices law with such perfectionism and obedience, the case is like David vs. Goliath. Evertyhing seems lost, everyone is against Galvin, including a memorable one-sided judge. But he goes on, despite his fears, his mistakes, his clumsiness, the way he seems so unsure of his words ... Frank Galvin doesn't have the phlegm of Atticus Finch, nor the flamboyance of Hans Rolfe, or the charisma of Arthur Kirkland, but his weaknesses make him 'strong' and the case 'personal' in the noblest sense of the word. This movie is probably one of the greatest courtroom dramas ever directed, because it gives its true meaning to the word 'justice'. Justice is not about values, it's about faith, it's a blind faith which makes us take all the risks, because ironically, justice can only be accomplished through 'illegal' ways when the opposite side buries important elements under obscure judiciary concepts and in these cases, when the system is against Justice. Frank Galvin was against the system, and believed in Justice. He's a hero. Frank Galvin fought for an idea of Justice threatened by the system, men like the judge or Concannon, who make justice, sometimes, unfair. The Verdict is the greatest courtroom drama because it is the one that gives you the greatest faith in justice ...

Starring Paul Newman in a performance best described as straight from the core, the film flips the idea of justice on its head and reveals the enduring human spirit that lies within the tireless pursuit of it.Frank Galvin (Newman) is a lawyer and alcoholic resigned to checking the obituaries for possible cases and dropping his card off at wakes. When a colleague hands him a medical malpractice case that's a shoo-in for a lucrative settlement outside of court, Galvin decides that there's a good chance to win the case before a jury and decides to take on the hospital's crack legal team (led by James Mason) without his client's permission in attempt to seek true justice and resurrect his career.Lumet's film is the opposite of melodramatic, something to which a courtroom movie is quite susceptible. There's barely a single bit of scoring and the characters express intense emotions with a respectable amount of reservation. One might think this undermines the impact of the David Mamet's thought-provoking script, but in an unexpected way it really grounds the film. It's not an emotional crusade against injustice or your typical underdog story. Instead, it's about the harsh realities of the justice system despite our every effort to believe in a higher moral authority by which all men and women are bound, one that will right all wrongs.Newman's Oscar-nominated performance owes a lot to Lumet, the master of wide shots, long takes and careful zooms and pans. Without a heightened sense of drama and suspense from the camera-work, Newman would be hung out to dry. So much of his acting is occurring below the skin and inside the mind that only a top-notch director could show the audience inside of it. The single take starting with a wide courtroom shot during Frank's closing statement and ending with him sitting down as if there was nothing else he could do might be the best example of Lumet and Newman working in incredible harmony.Lumet gets that caliber of performance out of everyone from co-star Charlotte Rampling to James Mason's unbreakable defense attorney. It says so much more about a film when it's as effective without dialogue as it is with it. The quiet opening shot of Frank with a beer and cigarette playing his favorite pub pinball machine sets the tone right away that the audience is to infer mostly from this film.

What he wants in the beginning is just that he should go the dependent, settle for a certain amount of money and take his share but when he visits his client in the hospital in her vegetative state he can't just take the money because if he takes the money he will be a lost, rich,ambulance chaser so he goes to court which is not easy at all because he has not a decent witness and the only good witness he has, a doctor whose opinion counts is 'got to' by the defendant's side. All his hope lies in his determination and a nurse who does not testify for the doctors.The acting of Paul Newman is just impressive. When one sees his acting in the movie, one can't help saying such players should just live longer. Charlotte Rampling as the cold Laura Fischer seems pretty sensual for a femme fatale.There are those who compares the movie with 'Twelve Angry Men' which is another great Sidney Lumet movie.The comparison is not fair to me because 12 Angry Man never enters a court room at all. It takes the system of justice through a jury's deliberations but The Verdict is not about discussing a concept like 'presumption of innocence'.It is about the struggle of a man who takes aside a book,the lawyers or a a marble statue which are the trappings of the court but have faith in the justice.The Verdict has its minor flaws for me too. First, a doctor named Gruber who is supposed to give corroborating testimony, who can afford to say 'I have an interest in hospitals. I don't want those bozos in the same profession as me' is easily bought off by the defendant maybe that makes the movie more believable in this wicked world but it did not sound OK to me.Second, though the two lawyers are out of time and they have been doing the legwork for the last eighteen months(which is only mentioned in the movie)it sounds like they have enough time to pick up a surprise witness, for instance. Still that does not make the movie a bad one. This is a treat for those who love the trial movies.

Paul Newman is considered one of the finest actors that Hollywood has ever produced, his long career producing a great abundance of terrific films and stunning performances. And now for the confession 'The Verdict (1982)' is the earliest film in which I've seen Paul Newman. Having seen his solid performances in 'The Hudsucker Proxy (1994)' and especially 'Road to Perdition (2002),' I already have great respect for his talents, but it'd be ignorant to deny that I'm still yet to experience his finest hours. In Sidney Lumet's 1982 courtroom drama, Newman plays Frank Galvin an aging, alcoholic lawyer who, a long time ago, lost whatever confidence and self-respect he once had. The film also boasts an impressive supporting cast, including James Mason, Jack Warden and Charlotte Rampling.Newman really is superb in the film's main role. His Frank Galvin is a tortured character once an honest and successful lawyer, Frank's career and marriage were ruined after his employers framed him for jury-tampering, reducing him to a disheartened, immoral ambulance-chaser in order to survive. His good friend and colleague, Mickey Morrissey (Jack Warden), is dismayed at his deterioration, but nonetheless agrees to offer Frank one final case, which is sure to be settled easily outside court. However, after visiting his comatose client &#150; her life forever destroyed by the negligence of the hospital doctors &#150; Frank spies redemption within his grasp, and so resolves to achieve justice at any cost. Rounding off the perfect triangle of veteran performers (each of whom had worked with director Sidney Lumet previously) is Jason Mason, who plays respected lawyer Ed Concannon with such composure and acumen that you're almost willing to declare him the winner of the case.When it comes to discussing 'The Verdict,' Lumet's cinematic debut '12 Angry Men (1957)' seems the natural comparison, though that's yet another classic that I haven't seen Sidney Lumet has recently become my director-to-watch, after producing one of the most thrilling movies ever made, 'Fail-Safe (1964)'. Lumet gives the entire film a wintry, coldly-detached tone, with the camera often settled in the distance and making effective use of long shots. The script was penned by David Mamet from a novel by Barry Reed, cruelly placing obstacle after obstacle on Frank Galvin's path to redemption, until his self-esteem is all but destroyed. It is only through the encouragement of Mickey Morrissey and recent-girlfriend Laura Fischer (Charlotte Rampling) that Frank can find the strength to continue the trial, though the latter also plays a more sinister role in the unfolding of the case.'The Verdict' is certainly one of the top ten most compelling legal dramas I've come across. Though Newman's final address to the jury is not quite as rousing as the equivalents in 'To Kill a Mockingbird (1962)' or 'Breaker Morant (1980),' for example, the film is held aloft by three superb veteran performances and its admirable sense of moral justice. Though the infinitely-shrewd Ed Concannon manages to convince the biased judge (Milo O'Shea) to completely disregard the damning testimony of the admitting nurse, Kaitlin Costello (Lindsay Crouse), he can't convince the honest jurors to forget what they have heard. In strict legal terms, Ed Concannon mounted the perfect case, but simple human decency directed the jury to reach a verdict that was morally just.

I think the most surprising in this picture is The Verdict is much more than a conventional courtroom drama it's about a character's spiritual resurrection, or at least, the chance of the resurrection. From this view, Frank Galvin's final success is much more he could reach as a lawyer it is the success of a man, who had to face with his past and, of course, his present which seemed hopeless. The Verdict's most powerful element is naturally Paul Newman's performance - maybe this role is the peak of his career and talent. His partners are excellent too, Charlotte Rampling, Jack Warden and James Mason. I like very much the works of Sidney Lumet, but sometimes irritates me, how much the characters speak in his films - namely this produces a little theatrical feeling what can be the disadvantage of films (for example, in an otherwise very good movie, Lumet's The Network). Well, in The Verdict the characters don't speak a lot, moreover there are a plenty of moments when they silence. This fact leads to beautiful pictorial compositions. I mentioned this film as an autumn portray, however The Verdict plays in winter. I know, but the whole world of this drama is much more has an autumn character - with a lot of orange, red Lumet and his talented photographer, Andrzej Bartkowiak consciously produced this feeling, they wanted to follow the style of Caravaggio's pictures. In the camera-work as well they had an artistic work when Mickey (Jack Warden) tells Frank, what he knows about Laura's betrayal, we see this scene from long shot, without words, only the sounds of the street and the traffic - this is brilliant. But the final shot - when Frank is behind his table, and we don't know whether he will answer the phone or not - is simply unforgettable. To sum up, The Verdict is one of the most beautiful and artistic mainstream Hollywood movies very highly recommended.

This is the case. Sidney Lumet's beautiful shot direction allow you to share the pain with Mickey (Newman), and Andrzej Bartkowiak lights these shots accordingly.

Either the version I saw recently was a 'director's cut' with new scenes inserted, or the movie is more watchable on TV than in the theater. When I saw it recently on the tube I caught backstory and sideplots I'd missed before. For example Frank Galvin (Paul Newman) started out working for courthouse hack Mickey Morrisey (Jack Warden), landed a job with a white-shoe firm that exploited his naivete and ruined his career, and then finally Mickey Morrisey took him back. Frank Galvin still naively loves his ex-wife, daughter of the white-shoe firm's senior partner, even though she assisted in Frank's betrayal. The Charlotte Rampling temptress is hired partly because of a fleeting resemblance to Frank's ex-wife.The David Mamet script is a gem, relentlessly plotted, but its depiction of Boston is pure science-fiction and fantasy. Mamet offers the peculiar notion that everybody in Boston, with the exception of one Jewish doctor, is an Irish Catholic; moreover at least half of them are Irish-born and speak in rich brogues. So here we have the half-Jewish Newman and the half-Jewish Warden both playing Boston-Irish lawyers, though without any Boston intonation or accent, and the Irish-Irish veteran actor Milo O'Shea playing the capricious judge while looking like the late Tom Snyder in a pageboy haircut, and talking like a bookie from Cork City. Then we get English actor James Mason as Concannon, attorney for the defense ('Prince-of-F**ing-Darkness,' according to Jack Warden's Mickey Morrisey), and he talks just like...James Mason! And not James Mason in Odd Man Out, either. An upper-class Dubliner, perhaps. Are you licensed to practice here, Mr. Concannon?All-American actress and theater royalty Lindsay Crouse would be a perfectly believable Irish colleen, were it not for the broad stage-Irish that she speaks for no discernible reason.Nobody, but nobody, talks with any sort of Boston accent. Even straightforward American accents are thin on the ground. Charlotte Rampling makes a good try but comes across as an English girl who did part of her growing up in Connecticut.As if to emphasize the strange version of Irishry imposed on the production by Mamet--a brilliantly imaginative East-European Jew who is more at home writing scripts about grunting, potty-mouthed Hollywood agents than he is trying to conjure up a sense of old-line Americana--the movie set is a dank procession of dark-wood pubs, frosted-glass partitions, and elegant but dimly lit Beacon Hill townhouses a set that could serve equally well for James Joyce's Dublin or A. Conan Doyle's London. I applaud this brilliant fantasy as an aesthetic experiment, but I found it extremely distracting when I first saw the film in its theatrical release. It is as though you go to see a film set in Manhattan, and a parade of cowboys and indians periodically streams down Fifth Avenue, and no one ever explains why.

Sidney Lumet, who made such masterpieces as 12 Angry Men, Long Day's Journey Into Night, The Pawnbroker, Dog Day Afternoon, Prince of the City and Running on Empty, creates a gripping atmosphere and very fine courtroom images.Some critics have called The Verdict one of Lumet's masterpieces. I'm not sure about it. The plot seems somewhat constructed sometimes, especially towards the end. There are also some errors in legal details, as others have indicated.It has also been said that the behaviour of Newman, Mason and O'Shea wasn't credible, since it wasn't always ethical and since they risked their licenses. I disagree with this kind of criticism, since it completely misses the point of the picture. In Lumet's pictures you seldom find characters without human flaws. Newman's character should certainly have consulted his clients and should have asked them whether they wanted to accept the hospital's offer or not. That he hasn't consulted them shows his complete obsession to win this one case to restore his self-esteem. It shows a human flaw in Newman's character. He makes a mistake. This is made pretty clear in the picture! But it's an understandable mistake. He also beats Rampling, which is also morally wrong. But that's what makes the movie so interesting. Its hero is a three-dimensional one, a character with both good and bad aspects. The behaviour of O'Shea's and especially Mason's characters isn't ethical of course. But people who criticize this as incredible don't see that there is corruption among lawyers and judges as there is corruption in most professions. Those who think that this is false or that the corruption is always revealed and punished are a bit naive. The movie has been misunderstood by some as a criticism of defense lawyers and judges in general. This is wrong. Lumet's works often deal with problems in the society and with corruption. But as his famous films about police corruption (Serpico, Prince of the City) don't claim that ALL cops are corrupt, The Verdict doesn't make such generalizations about the legal profession. Mason and O'Shea are NOT supposed to represent the majority of people who work as lawyers and judges (as Rampling's character isn't supposed to represent all women). You wouldn't think that L. Olivier's character in Marathon Man represents all dentists, would you? -)This is not the best courtroom drama ever made. I prefer Lumet's own 12 Angry Men, Preminger's Anatomy of a Murder, or Wilder's Witness for the Prosecution for instance. But The Verdict is in one league with a flawed, but admirable film like, say, Inherit the Wind.9/10 (**** out of *****) "},{"Title":"A bit of a drag","Date":"5 June 2008","Score":"10 out of 19 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" For a film lasting 129 minutes, I would say that there are about sixty minutes of prime material.

And the performance from Paul Newman is top notch maybe one of his best. All legal dramas are always interesting with the usual twist and turns of a case and the drama on the courtroom witness stand is always revealing and compelling and this 1982 film has all of those moments to occur.Set in Boston Paul Newman is Frankie Galvin an ambulance chasing lawyer who's on the downside of his work and his life. Frankie has lost three or four cases in a row, and he's divorced and he's became an alcoholic as his battle with the bottle is now a daily obsession in the form of many shots and glasses of whiskey. And much of Frankie's time in the free is conducted with him playing pinball at the local bar. Really a sad life for a lawyer it's like a midlife crisis. Only all of a sudden dumped in Frankie's lap is a dream case a medical malpractice case that seems impossible to win, yet Frankie is determined to fight the hospital and doctor's who negligence put a young woman in a coma for the rest of her life. As Frankie owes answers and money and justice to the family of this young lady. And you guessed it the determined Frankie wants to get his game back as he refuses settlement and instead takes the case to court.And in somewhat of a subplot Frankie has a fling somewhat of a one night stand with a divorced lady(played clever and elegantly by Charlotte Rampling)as with life the case has ups and downs still the film becomes a powerful drama as the entire legal system seems like it's put on trial in the courtroom. The Verdict is a film that searches for answers and it finds the truth leading to justice and most of all it's a moral and life and job awakening of a man named Frankie Galvin.

To me, this is just about a perfect movie, achieving exactly what it sets out to do, with everything in it and about it insuring the perfection of that achievement. Some say it is too slow, but this is the kind of story that has to be told slowly, as its main subject is not so much the legal case involved, but the step-by-step reemergence of a conscience that may lead to the reclamation of a human life and career from a decade or more of sheer mediocrity-cum-failure. The screenplay and direction are all of a piece, and they never veer off into cheap emotion, theatrics, violence, hyped-up speed or whatever. Lumet's direction is perfect, but it always is, and David Mamet's screenplay is a marvel of slow and painstaking discovery, both of salient story facts and of the characters' own strengths, weaknesses, fears and even concealed self-loathing (one gets the last not only in Newman's performance, but even in the short speech James Mason's character makes when justifying his and his firm's slimy methods). Which brings us to the acting, and this is really the primary reason to see this film, maybe even over and over again (I've seen it about 7 or 8 times since it first came out in 1982, each time with even more enjoyment and appreciation). Although the characters are just disparate enough to not rise to the level of an ensemble, this is film ensemble acting at its best. There is not a performance in the film that is not a stand-out. Others have already called this Newman's greatest film performance, and it well may be, but given so many superb acting jobs over almost 50 years, it may be hard to segregate any one of them as his best. But it is quietly yet grandly superb throughout. Mason's upper class but still somewhat seedy opposing attorney is as fine a thing as he ever did on screen, yet again, he did so much that even a thing as fine as this is simply running against self-competition! Jack Warden, among the most underrated actors of his time, equals them in his own way, even if in the kind of typically gruff and rough-and-ready role that was his trademark. The enigmatic performance of Charlotte Rampling as Newman's new - and maybe first in many years - love interest, comes into its own when certain hidden plot elements emerge towards the end of the film. Milo O'Shea is hatefully magnificent as the Judge, an almost too realistic near-parody of the kind of Boston Irish semi-political hack who does mean and nasty things and probably hits the Confessional once a month to be absolved of having done them. Binns is on the fence as the head of the Archdiocese, a Cardinal who seems to want to act justly, yet is willing to accede to what he intuits are some pretty unsavory methods used by his defense team, this in order to protect the reputation of the Archdiocese. Arguably the two best performances in the film are in minor roles, with Julie Bavasso (God, what an underrated actress for decades) as an older nurse who seems frightened to death of what she has witnessed in her job, and is now unwilling to speak of it to anyone, most particularly to Newman's plaintiff's attorney, finally breaking her reserve only to call him and all other members of the legal profession whores. (In this story, it's hard to disagree with her.) And finally there is a gorgeous near-cameo appearance by Lindsay Crouse (Mamet's wife) as the missing operating room witness, whose life and career have been substantially ruined by the combined medical establishment, hospital and Archdiocese. For all practical purposes, her five minutes or so on the witness stand practically steals the acting honors in this film, a feat that would seem manifestly impossible given what I have written to this point. I would also call your attention to Mamet's incredibly well-written circumlocutionary closing argument for the plaintiffs, even more incredibly delivered by Newman in a long one-shot camera take that starts to the right of the judge's bench and behind the jury with Newman sitting silently in the distance, takes in the entire slow and deliberate speech as he makes his way up to face the jury, stays on him throughout, and then follows him over the jury's heads as he returns to his seat, now in close-up as the scene fades out. It doesn't call attention to itself, but it is in the realm of what we might expect from Welles or Hitchcock in their very best innovative moments. A wonderful film in every conceivable way!

I will even add more praise in saying that it contains perhaps the greatest ensemble acting that you're ever going to witness. Is all of this too much praise to throw on a film? No when it's for a film like THE VERDICT.Obviously everything here begins and ends with Newman who gives one of the greatest performances that you're ever going to witness. I always said that Marlon Brando's performance in LAST TANGO IN Paris is the greatest performance i have ever seen but this one by Newman is close. Just take a look at the sequence before the trial where his character has a panic attack. Just see the fear in eyes, his movement and the fear in his voice. Watch his final speech to the jury. Check out a twist, which I won't ruin, but deals with him being betrayed. A lot of times a music score and editing help make a performance but in all of these scenes there are none of that. Instead it's just Newman delivering a performance and often it's shown in one take.Not only is the lead terrific but so are all the supporting players. Jack Warden is terrific in his role as the assistant. Charlotte Rampling is as calm and cold as you can get. As for Mason, did you ever doubt that you were watching a brilliant lawyer work his magic? Milo O'Shea will have your blood boiling in the role of the judge. All of the important characters are brought to life through terrific performances but even the small roles are flawlessly acted. Edward Binns as the Bishop.

His direction throughout is flawless. The film is slow-paced but it's done for a reason and it's impact is certainly felt in the end.

With his client in a coma and little hope of ever recovering, Galvin decides to reject a sizable payout from the Catholic Hospital that put her there and takes them to court in a high profile malpractice case.The 57-year-old Newman looks a far cry from his typical on screen self. His ratty suit and near constant stubble fit the hard-drinking Galvin, who frequently stumbles to the bar before lunch for a quick hangover cure. While his actions spiral him deeper and deeper out of control, the actor's steely blue eyes pierce through the character's rough exterior giving the audience hope for his redemption.As Galvin turns from the bottle and throws himself into the case, he begins to see the client as a person instead of a payday. Even as every tactic he throws at the jury is shot down by the Hospital's high powered attorney (Mason), he never loses hope. While the Catholic Church is at times depicted as the villain or at least a corporate entity, faith becomes the overwhelming theme of the film.The Verdict garnered five Oscar nominations, including only the second in Newman's long career. Though he would again lose out on the award, he would reinvent himself by proving he could still step out of his comfort zone as an actor.There is no real hero in this courtroom drama that relies more on emotional draw than actual evidence. Even though sometimes the leaps of the faith the plot takes are a little hard to believe, any fan of Newman will be a fan of The Verdict.

I didn't get to see it then, but remembered it as a film dramatically lost so many of its Oscar nominations to Richard Attenborough's Gandhi, especially the ones for Best Actor-Paul Newman and Best Director-Sidney Lumet. I still remember the face filled with painful disappointment of James Mason, the film's nominee for Best Supporting Actor, who died shortly after the film's great success. Thirty-three years passed, and I finally got to see this film, if you can believe it. Lumet, Newman, and Mason are all dead. The mysteriously beautiful Charlotte Rampling has become an old lady, still carrying with her some mystique. Bruce Willis and Tobin Bell, who were extras in the courtroom with no dialogue, have become a major and minor great stars respectively. This Lumet's film still holds. The power and the intent are still there with little to no blemish. Even the images of outdated phones, furniture, cars, and all the rest have failed to discredit the film. We know it is an old film, but we cannot care less. The story of the verdict of a man fallen out of the main road and trying to get back, professionally and morally, is timeless. It is not as cheesy as Rocky and not as flashy as The Wrestler. It is calm, serene, constantly moving, even without one single reason why the main character should have bothered continuing. It is a very exciting non-action film. This is a life you can find around you almost on daily basis, a totally failed drunken loser, yet watching it is freshly breathtaking, like discovering something new. The Verdict was purposely made in the stage style rehearsal after rehearsal, long takes and dialogues one after another, plus the virtually motionless cinematography. Brown tone of color all through the screen. All this should have bored and tired the audience to the bone. Yet we find two hours and 9 minutes of this film seamless and rather short. This is what a classic does.

The Verdict features Paul Newman and was written by David Mamet. This film has a medical context and a nursing role.A word about Sidney Lumet. Lumet directs quality movies about medico-legal, substance abuse and cultural issues. For instance, in Equus the plot is about a psychiatrist treating a boy who blinds a stable full of horses. Lumet also directed Long Day's Journey into the Night which is Eugene O'Neill's autobiographical account of his explosive home life, fueled by a substance abusing mother, an alcoholic father and a mentally ill brother. Dog Day Afternoon is about a gay man who robs a bank to pay for his lover's sex change operation. The simple robbery turns in to a hostage situation and a media circus. Critical Care, a medical comedy, is about a young hospital resident embroiled in a legal battle with siblings over the care of their rich, comatose father. The resident has a supervisor who insists that he only care for patients with full insurance. Finally, 12 Angry Men, another courtroom drama is about a young Hispanic male who is accused of murdering his father but the story really is about jurors' prejudices about the trial, their biases about the accused and each other.The Verdict depicts a once successful, now down-and-out lawyer who sees his career turning around when he accepts a medical malpractice case and refuses to settle rather than going to trial.Kaitlin Costello Price, Mamet's wife in real life by Lindsay Crouse, is a nurse who was involved in the pre-surgical care of the comatose patient. The long and short of her story is that she had to leave nursing because the surgeons told her to change a patient's record who had eaten an hour before the operation so they could use general anesthesia. If she did not falsify the record, she would never work as a nurse again. She doesn't.Her words echo in my mind to this day Who were these men? Who were these men? I wanted to be a nurse!Some racial profiling and sexual bias goes on here. A black doctor is brought in to testify and Newman treats him shabbily.Jack Warden called him a witch doctor. Additionally, there was a seen where Newman punched his girlfriend for lying to him and she thinks she deserves it.

"},{"Title":"Tedious in Places, but Newman is Great","Date":"28 January 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Probably the best way to describe The Verdict is as a character exploration which uses a courtroom drama/thriller as its vehicle. It's the story about the struggles of an alcoholic who is trying to redeem himself as a person, and sees this one case as an opportunity..maybe his last..to do it. The alcoholic in question is an ambulance chasing lawyer named Frank Galvin (played with understated brilliance by the great Paul Newman), and he's up against a lot more than just his own demons. He has to deal with a high profile defense lawyer who's not above playing dirty, a biased politician of a judge, and at times his own clients, who are angry when he turns down a large settlement offer. Galvin's clients are suing the Arch Diocese and Catholic hospital over a botched baby delivery where the child is killed and the mother is effectively turned into a vegetable.I understand that director Sidney Lumet was doing a character study first and a courtroom suspense a distant second here, but the pacing in some parts of the movie was slower than it needed to be. You see example after example of Galvin's drunkenness and how it affects his daily life, to the point where you're thinking, Enough already! I get it! It's not that those types of scenes aren't important. They're essential to tell the story. But some of them didn't need to be dragged out for so long, and it makes the whole movie feel like it's crawling at a snail's pace.The strength of this movie is its realistic approach to examining an all-too human problem that affects nearly all of us at one time or another in our lives, directly or indirectly, along with a great cast and fine performances, not only by Newman, but also by Jack Warden as his only real friend, Charlotte Rampling as the girl he gets involved with, James Mason as the shrewd and not always ethical defense lawyer, and Edward Binns as the Catholic Bishop. But ultimately, the one reason I have for seeing a movie as depressing and slow as this one is to watch Paul Newman, a true master of his craft, at work. Watching Newman act is like watching Randy Johnson pitch, Frank Lloyd Wright draft, or Da Vinci paint. Yeah, as an actor Newman really was that damned good.

Why? This is a film that earned five Oscar nominations, including for best actor. What was Redford afraid of? Apparently the scene where Frank strikes Laura with a full punch... but is that not the challenge of acting? Playing a role that is not your natural type? Did he really think that the audience would think he was a real-life woman-beater? I absolutely love where the defense team is coaching the doctor on how to answer questions. Is it realistic? I do not know. But it shows the finely-oiled machine that Frank is up against. A whole team of well-paid attorneys who know how to win a case... versus an old man who drinks too much. Quite an underdog story.Bonus very early roles for Tobin Bell and Bruce Willis (if you blink, you will miss them).

This is no doubt the best acting by Paul Newman in his career. Why he didn't get the Oscar for this role, but instead got it for the lackluster The Color of Money, is beyond me. The movie is actually about redemption, or the attempt to be redeemed.His interpretation of Frank Galvin, a desperate, conniving, down-to-the-last-case attorney, is fascinating and totally convincing. And he has a fantastic supporting cast -- from Jack Warden as his partner, Charlotte Rampling as his chance for romantic redemption, Milo O'Shea as the corrupt judge, Lindsay Crouse as his surprising ace-up-his-sleeve, and most of all, in a landmark supporting actor role, James Mason as the seemingly distinguished and respected defense attorney.And I found the direction by Sidney Lumet to be, once again, outstanding. Lumet has such a long list of great movies that you wonder why he has never won an Oscar or been given an AFI Lifetime Achievement award.This is a riveting movie -- about the law, but mainly about the flawed nature of the human beings who are entrusted with it. Please hear Newman, as Frank Galvin, on his last, crippled, despairing leg, give the summation to the case. It needs to be carved in marble somewhere. David Mamet, who wrote the screenplay, deserves accolades for how he was able to hand Paul Newman such a moving summation. The summation is about life, not just the law. It is a masterpiece, worth seeing the entire movie for.Most of all, it is Newman's Finest Hour.

They're usually more about being detectives (which is why I kinda like them) and having an impassioned closing argument than actually trying a case.

Since the lawsuit involves a woman in a persistent vegetative state, the movie is cast in the shadow of the Karen Ann Quinlan case. The movie stars Paul Newman, Charlotte Rampling, Jack Warden, James Mason, Milo O'Shea, and Lindsay Crouse.It was directed by by Sidney Lumet.The film was adapted by David Mamet from the novel by Barry Reed.In this courtroom drama The Verdict,Paul Newman portrays Frank Galvin, an alcoholic Boston lawyer who tries to redeem his personal and professional reputation by winning a difficult medical malpractice case. Frank, down on his luck, is presented with the case of his life when he is approached by the family of a woman who has been left in a coma following an operation in a large Catholic hospital. Helped by his assistant Mickey (Jack Warden), he agrees to take the case, hoping for a fast settlement. When he visits the victim in the hospital, he becomes emotionally involved, turns down a sizable settlement offer made by the hospital, and decides to bring the case to trial despite the formidable opposition of the Church and its lawyer,Ed Concannon (James Mason).He is also assisted by his new girlfriend, Laura (Charlotte Rampling),a woman who turns out to have an unusual past. Paul Newman is one unbelievable actor.The Verdict proves just that.It is an excellent movie that proves his acting capabilities.He was at his best in this film.He definitely should have won the Oscar if he wasn't up against Ben Kingsley of the movie,Gandhi that same year.Apart from Newman,James Mason also gives a fine, Oscar-nominated performance as Frank Galvin's opponent,Ed Concannon.Other worthy performance in the film is that from Charlotte Rampling as the deceitful Laura, who never seems to turn down a drink.I consider this also one of Sidney Lumet's best films aside from Serpico and Dog Day Afternoon.The Verdict works flawlessly from the story,the stellar performances of the cast and the cinematography of Edward Pisoni in presenting the emotions and moods especially that of the characters particularly Frank Galvin.Overall,it truly deserves its Academy Award nominations for Best Picture,Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Director.The Verdict is one excellent film.Although there are some legal inaccuracies in the story,it still remains one excellent courtroom drama movies ever done.The theme is powerful especially when it presents corruption in the legal system and certain institutions,how money overcomes the implementation of justice and the issue of medical malpractice.

Just watch The Verdict and you will understand. Paul Newman stars as Frank Galvin, a down on his luck lawyer who is desperate for a big case to get him back on his feet and move his failing career along. He sees this potential in a case involving a woman who was allegedly put into a coma by the doctors at the hospital she was staying at. Galvin becomes obsessively determined to win this case at any cost, even with all the hurdles and obstacles that come his way while he gets closer and closer to court. It's an exciting film with a great storyline and incredible performances from all, especially the great Paul Newman.Sidney Lumet has a way of filmmaking that is so subtly excellent, and subsequently so under-appreciated. In some ways The Verdict is just a standard courtroom drama, but in other ways it's not. Lumet employs a grittier and darker style of filmmaking that sets The Verdict apart and puts it way ahead of its time. It has that subtle effect of not being a loud or obvious film. It's not one that you are blown away by or absolutely astounded by, but the level of appreciation one has to possess towards this film is insurmountable. It is that brand of high quality filmmaking that one just doesn't see every day.The Verdict has the kind of raw finesse that can only be picked up by those with an astute appreciation for this kind of subtle filmmaking. This quality lies in the direction of the film, but also in the script. The always incredible David Mamet is the screenwriter for this film, and it's very easy to tell. Mamet does with words what action films do with explosions. He creates a riveting and enthralling experience just through the fancy wordplay and the sophisticated dialect all of the characters flaunt. It is a script that never gets unbearably dull and the dialogue never fall short of genius. Whether you like the movie or not there's no denying that it is of a truly profound quality.The Verdict is a quintessential court room drama film that you would be foolish not to see. It's got all the star power you could ask for from a dramatic exposition like this. Sidney Lumet, David Mamet, and Paul Newman all come together to make this is great film that my admiration for goes on for a long, long time. It might be a little slow and moments and it is certainly a very high brow film, but my respect for the quality of this film knows no boundaries.

Great director, amazing cast, but zero acting and no character development. So many things happen without reason - Newman's character's unexplained epiphany leading to moral redemption being just one. Similarly, one of the film's most dramatic courtroom moments - the jury's decision - makes absolutely no sense, at least given the scanty trial information the film provides. As courtroom drama it is shockingly unconvincing. Thus, when the judge breaks into Newman's character's cross examination of his expert witness to do the work of the defense attorney, supposedly a world-renowned attorney played by the ever urbane James Mason, it is simply not credible. Newman's character's entire case hinges on a single witness, who conveniently disappears on the eve of the trial, leaving him depressed and self-pitying. He is given no solace by the mysterious and beautiful woman who turns out to be complicated and may actually have something to do with the movie, though it isn't ever made clear. Jack Warden plays his friend and partner in the fateful case and is totally wasted, as is Mason and everyone else in this bad film. Sorry, I really expected much better.

Was it elective? She would have known to wait 8 hours before coming in for surgery. Besides, even at this time most C-Sections were being done under Spinal or Epidural and aspiration would not be an issue.

Paul Newman, in one of his best performances, plays Frank Galvin, a middle age alcoholic lawyer who is down, way down, on his luck. Opening scenes often set the tone for a movie, and that is the case here. Frank is seen glumly playing a pinball machine and drinking a beer. The camera slowly zooms in on Frank's profile where you can read dejection and weariness. That one scene tells us a lot of what we need to know about Frank.Frank's friend, and sometimes associate, Mickey refers a medical malpractice case to Frank that looks like it would be a slam dunk for a quick settlement. And that is what develops initially, but in a well scripted and filmed transformation Frank comes to see the case as an injustice that should be righted with more than a pro forma settlement. The case is also probably Frank's last chance to redeem his career as well his sense of self worth.The ever intriguing Charlotte Rampling is perfectly cast as a woman who takes up with Frank. My early reaction to Rampling, and the way she was filmed, was to agree with Frank when he said to her, My god, you are some beautiful woman. James Mason is superb as Ed Concannon, a cynical head of a top flight Boston law firm; Ed leavens his killer instinct with a sharp wit. Jack Warden shines as Mickey and Milo O'Shea is positively chilling as a powerful and politically connected judge you don't want to cross. Clearly a lot of work went into designing the sets. Frank's office looks out into an archway that always seems to be cloudy--it provides a perfect backdrop for the grayness of Frank's life. It's an achievement that such a small space as Frank's office is made to accommodate many camera angles. One intense scene is made powerful by having the camera appear to be mounted on the floor looking up to Frank on one side of his desk and Mickey on the other. The scenes filmed in the courtroom and courthouse accentuate the formality of such venues and make the people and their cares seem small.Director Lumet uses closeups to great effect, particularly by the way they are lighted. Light often strikes a face at an angle, creating a contrast of light and shadow that almost achieves the effectiveness of black and white portrait photography. Scenes in the courtroom that appear to be lighted by natural light are also effective. The final scene left me wondering about Frank's future. Too late now for a follow-up in the way that The Color of Money updated The Hustler.

Although the movie follows regular movie rules and has a very little original content it does offer good insight on the politics of law. There seems to be a sort of cynical tone somewhere in the writer's head, trying to show how justice does not always have its way, especially when a competitive corporation is up against a small group. There is a monologue I particularly liked, one about the firm paying employees to win and not to do their best, otherwise their existence would just fade, there seems to be a dichotomy between survival and justice depicted which is done in a very effective manner.

But though some of the particulars may be a bit dated, there's nothing that can take away from Paul Newman's performance as one of the great characters in movie history.Frank Galvin (Paul Newman) is a middle aged attorney who would technically be called an ambulance chaser, except Frank isn't even good enough to chase ambulances. He actually scams his way into funeral visitations and gives his card to grieving family members, passing himself off as an old friend of the deceased. Frank drinks a lot, but it's still not enough to completely drown his own self-loathing. He works out of a tiny office with no secretary and barely manages to get into court. Frank Galvin is pretty much the last person you'd want arguing your case.But Frank still has friends who remember him from better days and one of them, Mickey (Jack Warden), has thrown a case Frank's way. It's about a young woman who went into a Catholic hospital with nausea, was given the wrong anesthetic and wound up a vegetable. Her closest family wants some money to take care of her and maybe help get themselves started on a new life. At first Frank is thrilled with the case. He's got a great expert witness on his side and he can smell the retainer he'll collect from the Church's settlement offer. But then Frank goes to see the young woman lying comatose in her hospital bed. He wants to take pictures of her he can wave in front of the Bishop to try and get them to raise their offer. But something happens to Frank when he looks at that young woman. He actually sees her. He doesn't see a settlement check. He doesn't see his retainer. He sees a ruined human being and he just can't let this case go away for money.Frank rejects the settlement offer, without checking with the woman's family, and heads into court against the Church's army of lawyers, led by Ed Concannon (James Mason), a professorial yet utterly ruthless attorney. Frank wants this trial to redeem himself, but that's an easy thing to want when you think you're going to win. When Frank's expert witness disappears, his cross examinations fall apart and the judge openly sides with the defense&#x85;Frank stops thinking he can win. But even with defeat weighing him down like a suit of armor, Frank manages to find one witness, one shred of evidence that might save the day. That is, if it doesn't get thrown out of court on a technicality.As I mentioned before, the desperate tactics, underhanded maneuvering and seemingly unfair and arbitrary nature of the legal system may have been quite a shock to folks with a Perry Mason view of the law. But whether you've watched L.A. Law, Law and Order or O.J. Simpson's murder trial, you've probably seen a lot worse and a lot more twisted stuff than you'll find in The Verdict.That doesn't detract much from the greatness of this movie because the heart of the story remains Newman's outstanding performance as Frank Galvin. This is a deeply flawed man. A broken man who in a crisis of conscience clutches to what he thinks may be his last chance to save himself. But what truly sets Frank Galvin apart as one of the great characters of American cinema is that he remains flawed, even on his road back to redemption. When the case turns against him, Frank frantically tries to weasel his way out and runs to his girlfriend for sympathy. Even his desire to take the case to trial is fundamentally a selfish one. He's willing to risk the welfare of a comatose young woman and the future of her family for his shot at redemption. But Newman totally succeeds in making us care about Frank's struggle for his soul, even while showing us that Frank will never be perfect.Aside from the reason why Frank's new girlfriend (Charlotte Rampling) takes up with him just before trial not making a lot of sense when you think about it, the plot of this film is very solid with very powerful, though perhaps not that memorable, dialog. There are two points where the judge (Milo O'Shea) acts in service of the Almighty Plot Hammer, but that's largely forgivable.Courtroom dramas, especially on TV, have long since outpaced what you'll see in The Verdict but there hasn't been much to compare to Frank Galvin, and one of the greatest movie stars in one of his best roles is more than enough reason to watch this film.

What is touching about this masterpiece is it talks about a morale side and about how humans treat and deal with each others. Sidney Lumet directs this movie cleverly , its one of his best movies ever. One of the best courtroom dramas, with profound medical error case that should be going for a publicity trial. We have to be responsible about our acts, jobs and professions .

The whole idea here is redemption, and once we see his character, Frank Galvin, making a stab at it, well, he's got us. If the film wasn't so skillfully put together, so well acted and directed, one might consider the ending a cheat. But it doesn't feel that way. It feels like justice. At the beginning, the boozy Galvin is shown going from funeral to funeral passing out business cards, always hurrying to his local watering hole at the end of the day to swap stories and jokes with the regulars there. He actually does have a case, one he doesn't pay much attention to until it's almost too late. A young woman is in a coma after a difficult childbirth, and her sister has sued the hospital and its doctors for not preventing it. When Galvin finally gets around to checking into it, something stirs inside him. He sees a chance to do something right again. He's not even sure why he's doing it and he wavers often. His mentor, Mickey Morrissey (Jack Warden, in a great, gruff performance), is really Frank's strength, helping him, encouraging him, criticizing him. Galvin turns down a substantial offer from the hospital's sponsor, the local Catholic diocese, to settle out of court and proclaims his intention to try the case. Everyone, including Mickey, thinks he's crazy. James Mason plays Ed Concannon, the hospital's attorney, and he is smooth and cunning as we would expect. He has a battery of lawyers to assist him and all the money and resources one could wish for. Concannon is supremely confidant and it isn't until the final few moments that he has any reason not to be. He hires a woman, Laura Fischer (Charlotte Rampling), to befriend and seduce Galvin, so that he'll know exactly what the other side is doing at any given moment. David Mamet's screenplay is near-perfect, displaying that great writer's brilliance with dialogue, relationships, and situations once again. Sidney Lumet's direction is sombre without being stodgy, deliberately paced but always moving the story forward, letting us see it from all the characters' perspectives. Even with a wonderfully varied cast of supporting actors, this is another latter-day showcase for Paul Newman, reminding one in many ways of 'Absence of Malice.' His characters in these films are not dissimilar; down-on-their-luck through much of the film but always ultimately rising to the occasion. And the ending of 'The Verdict' is every bit as satisfying to us as it is to Frank Galvin, sitting in his office and refusing to answer Laura Fischer's phone call.

It's one reason this film resonates with so many people. It's a common experience that brings out different emotions in different people. The remake, although not as effective because of the lack of originality, is also good and brings in other points of view, including racial issues. Both lack one thing--a female's point of view!

The presiding judge and defense attorney for the accused doctors seem to be in bed with each other. A doctor, who was going to testify for the comatose victim is bought off, and Newman's new love interest is working secretly for the defense team as well. In addition, Galvin is screamed at by the brother-in-law of the victim. The former wanted Galvin to take the money that was being offered to settle the case.What makes this movie so memorable is that it deals with our court system and seeming injustices. The church, which ran the hospital, does not come out looking too well at all.

This is probably Sidney Lumet's last great film after such classics as 12 Angry Men, Serpico, Fail Safe, Murder on the Orient Express, Dog Day Afternoon, et al. Paul Newman was robbed, this is one of his best performances, and that's saying a lot. I love the little nuances of his performance, like when he greets the witch doctor at the railroad station, he feels the material of his overcoat as Galvin is sizing up his expert witness. I've always thought Newman had a great comic sense, which can be seen in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, for example.This is my 2nd favorite film of all time with deep personal meaning. No I am not an alcoholic, but most of us have been underdogs at sometime in our lives. We've all had people doubting our capabilities, just as James Mason's team of lawyers discount Galvin's competence. This film is about personal redemption. Further, I admire Frank's strength in not going back to Laura after she betrayed him. We've all known a woman like that in our lives...The cast is outstanding James Mason, Milo O'Shea, Charlotte Rampling, along with perennial Lumet actors Jack Warden and Edward Binns. The script is by the best American Playwrite, David Mamet, who doesn't require an introduction.As I stated, Newman should have won the Best Actor Oscar. It was a tough year, against the great Peter O'Toole and Ben Kingsley. I always thought his first and only Oscar for The Color of Money was out of sympathy for losing in 1982, but he gave a great performance in that film as well. Still and all, this film is timeless, important, and motivating to all of us who have faced a personal crisis.

After almost being disbarred for being too honest Frank's career as an attorney had gone straight down the toilet with him handling four cases in the last three years losing all of them. Unable to get over his drinking problems Frank spends his time in Boston bars playing pin-pall machines and telling corny jokes to the patron's, just so someone would buy him a drink. Frank is now down to attending funerals where he hands out his business card to the outrage of grieving family members.Mickey Morrissey an old and good friend of Frank's hands him a case that he feel Frank can handle involving a malpractice case against a Boston Catholic hospital St. Catherine's. Debroah Ann Kaye, Susan Benenson, had been admitted to the hospital to give birth and after being treated with amnesia fell into a coma after her brain was kept, as a result of her treatment, for getting oxygen for as much as 10 minutes.The Catholic Archdiocese that the hospital is part of offers an out of court settlement for $210,000.00 to Frank's clients Sally, Roxanne Hart, Deborah's sister and her husband Kevin Doneghy, James Handy, who are caring for the comatose Deborah. Frank balks on the deal and decides, against Mickey's strong objection's, to take the case before a jury. Frank also very unprofessionally, to the point of again being disbarred, keeps the news of the settlement offer from his clients which can also get him fired as their lawyer. On top of all that Frank foolishly falls in love with a woman Laura Fisher, Charlotte Rampling, that he meets while he's getting smashed in one of the many bars he drinks at who's working for the enemy, the defense, who he confides his most personal feelings about the case and how he plans to handle it in court!Great courtroom drama in and out of court with Frank Galvin, who never seemed to give up drinking during the movie, using his sense of justice and bulldog determination more then his knowledge of the law to overcome a battery of lawyers from a multi-million dollar law firm. The firm is headed by defense attorney Ed Concannor, James Mason, and his very good friend, who seemed to be working for Concannor in every decision he made on he case, Judge Hoyle (Milo O'Shea).Frank goes as far as breaking the law, by breaking into a mailbox, to get a very important witness who can break the case wide open former St. Catherine's nurse Kaitlin Costello Price (Lindsey Crouse) to testify. Kaitlin's appearance and explosive cross-examination testimony about how the hospital mishandled Deborah's operation had the smug and so-sure of himself Concannor almost get a heart attack and run, with his tail between his legs, to his very good friend and secret tag-team partner in the case Judge Hoyle. Concannor wants the Judge to strike all of Kaitlin's damaging testimony against his client from he record which a very willing helpful Judge Hoyle did.Touching yet simple closing statement by Frank will have you like it did the jury and all those in the courtroom, and even I suspect Judge Hoyle, almost in tears that went right to the heart of the matter. Frank appealed to the jury's sense of of real justice not the justice that those in power always get with their money and influence and, in case that doesn't work, by intimidating, persons like nurse Kaitlin Costello Price and ambushing and defaming defense lawyers like attorney Frank Garvin. P.S That big sneak Laura who worked her way into Frank's heart and apartment and was sandbagging his case from day one got her share of justice as well; a solid right-cross straight POW in the kisser from Frank.

Watching him here in The Verdict, therefore, is nothing short of a revelation. Where a lot of actors would need a couple of paragraphs of dialogue to give you an idea of what is going through their minds, Newman tells you with just a look. The broken nature of the court scenes (abruptly leaving during the middle of Newman's opening argument, never hearing Mason's closing one) may be a bit much for some to take, but as the rest of the movie makes clear, the case is only part of the story. The behind-the-scenes manuevers, the strategy sessions at the firm of Newman's opponents, Newman's scrambling for any solid straw in the wind--due credit goes to one of my favorite screenwriters, David Mamet, as well as Newman for making these just as, if not more, important than anything that we missed in the courtroom.The images, I think, that will stay the most in my mind are the opening scene at the pinball machine and the unanswered call at the office at film's end. It struck me how much the sounds of the pinball machine ringing and the phone ringing were so much alike. But maybe Mamet was going for symbolism; the pinball machine representing randomness, chaos, luck of the draw and the phone as direction, purpose, focus. Regardless of such speculation, it helps to make the same point that High Noon made three decades before doing the right thing is never easy...and sometimes, the price is VERY high.

John Grisham has become the popular voice for pitting lawyers up against the most intricate cases and nearly always having their client come out winning in the end. The Verdict, unlike others of its genre, refuses to be mired down by the standard conventions, preferring to look beyond the courtroom into what makes an attorney tick, the stress they are under to succeed, and the myth that they are all out to make a fast buck. Paul Newman has one of his best and most interesting character portrayals here as Frank Galvin, an admitted ambulance chaser who has a sudden attack of conscience during a medical malpractice suit. A heavy drinker and deeply fearful of entering the courtroom again, Frank refuses to accept an offer from the church and the hospital to let the case go away easy.  Justice is what he is after, even if the odds are dreadfully against him. Especially when he is against James Mason as the prosecuting attorney does he have reason to be anxious. You get to see behind-the-scenes what an attorney is all about, combatting the stereotype that lawyers are whores without a sense of loyalty or esteem. This is one of many Newman characters who is not ashamed to show weakness and vulnerability, but still fights for what is right and just in society. It's not surprising to discover David Mamet wrote the screenplay; each line is soaked with meaning and truth. The final summation by Newman is beautifully delivered without excessive theatrics. It is a beautiful pairing of a fine actor with a juicy script. Sidney Lumet, the director, keeps the atmosphere dark as always, but preserves the necessary realism to make this law drama shine like few others have done before or since. Every case a lawyer faces must be treated as if it were their last, and Newman is put through the ringer like nobody else. The conclusion (which I won't reveal) makes you stand up and cheer for its vindication and glory, not only for Newman but for the belief that justice can triumph in the face of a sometimes corrupt legal system.

My background is in anesthesiology and I can say that the aspects regarding the profession were given taking very little in the way of literary license. These aspects are very close to how things really can happen. This is not a Friday night movie meant to let you sit back and be entertained. This is a Saturday night movie when you've gathered your wits after a long week and you're prepared to watch a dramatic endeavor that challenges you to think about what you would do if you found yourself in a similar situation.

Even if there existed a darker side to his jovial laughter, Newman's characters always had a clear sense of who they were. From pool sharks to train robbers to grifters, Newman's characters were always likable, even if they were not always completely comprehensible. Interestingly, Newman was nominated seven times for acting without winning until he snatched the Oscar for The Color of Money, reprising his Academy-nominated role from The Hustler, Fast Eddie Felson. Some Hollywood insiders viewed the win more as recognition for Newman's career than a truly outstanding performance as the other nominees seemed to have offered far more powerful performances. However, some critics regard his performance in The Verdict, for which he was nominated but lost to Ben Kingsley (Gandhi), as quite possibly his best.Newman plays Frank Galvin, a character who is not the typical Newman self-assured role. Galvin is a nearly washed-out civil-suit attorney who is in the twilight of his career. Having once, we learn, been part of a prestigious law firm until he's forced to play fall guy for the firm's scandalous behavior, and is fired, Galvin is a depressed barfly sporting hard drinks and frequent turns at the pinball machine. And he seems lost in a world where he doesn't know where he fits in. His law practice is dismal, and he's resorted to attending post-funeral wakes hoping the family of the deceased might retain him for services provided the death seems wrongful. At one such wake, he's thrown out when he lies to the family, claiming he knew the deceased. He's not just an ambulance chaser, but a hearse chaser in some sense.Mickey Morrissey (Jack Warden), a colleague and former teacher, brings him just the case he's been looking for a young woman who fell into a coma during a failed childbirth at a Roman Catholic hospital in Boston. The family of the comatose victim desires to sue for malpractice. He meets a prestigious anesthesiologist who is willing to support the case, possibly testify at trial. At first Galvin is convinced the hospital and diocese will settle out of court, but then Galvin has a change of heart. He is technically not the attorney of the family members. His client is the comatose victim. He decides to take the case to trial despite a relatively large settlement offered by the Diocese. As a result, the surviving family, the victim's sister and her husband are incensed.A sub-story develops when Frank meets an attractive young woman at the bar he frequents, Laura Fischer, who we learn was once married to an attorney. The story moves on both fronts, in which Frank pursues the case and simultaneously engages in a relationship with Laura. Several stumbling blocks occur in the wake of declining the settlement, including the sudden unavailability of his star witness. Galvin then must pursue other witnesses, some of whom don't wish to testify, while also pursuing another medical expert willing to testify. And then his colleague Mickey stumbles upon something which could put the entire plaintiff's case in jeopardy. The final summation at the conclusion of the trial may be the best courtroom speech of its type since Atticus Finch's summation in To Kill a Mockingbird, as realized by Gregory Peck. The Verdict is an outstanding character-driven story which has as its theme the idea of second chances. As the story unfolds, we learn several characters were compelled onto undesirable paths which were not of their own making, Galvin being the obvious example along with his comatose client. Others are also in similar situations, but more subtly. Larger forces were at work which drove these characters out of their desired situations and into mediocre existences. In this story, there is the possibility for another chance to achieve their desires and reclaim their paths. Some characters succeed while others are denied this second chance at fulfillment and/or redemption.

Some of the best performances are the ones that aren't well-known to the Academy. In addition, an performance must convince the audience and insure us that the actor is willing to expand his or her character to desperate measures. Paul Newman is one of those actors who doesn't take any chances when it comes to acting out his roles. And in The Verdict, his performance is outstanding.Newman plays Frank Galvin, a once-promising Boston lawyer who just lost four cases in the last three years. His addiction to alcohol has increase over the years. He tries to make amends to clients that he doesn't know and his best friend, Mickey (Jack Warden), is just had enough of his losing streak. All of a sudden, Galvin is given a last chance at a big moneymaker case. The case is a malpractice one and the client want to take the case to trial. With the help of Mickey, Galvin manages to put together the trial. But, another lawyer, (James Mason), is willing to take part in the trial, too. With the two opposing sides working their way toward the trial, an woman, (Charlotte Rampling), falls in love with Galvin. To matters worse, Galvin's star witness disappeared before the trial and the doctor that Galvin appointed to doesn't have any prior knowledge of the case. As soon the problems start to mound on Frank's shoulders, it soon becomes clear that the odds are stack against him. The question will be Can Galvin pull himself together to make things right for himself and for the people around him?Paul Newman has never given a better performance than this. In my opinion, I wish that the Academy would give him the Oscar for his performance in this movie. He really convince me to believe that his character is not going to win the case. But yet, the people want him to do the right thing. His character is on the cuff of self- destruction. Basically, he is surrounded by a world that's filled with manipulation. Not only to himself, but to his peers. When the movie creates several drawbacks on the case, I started to realize more often that the movie is going to pull a fast one on me. What's surprising is that the movie pulls a fast one on it's itself when it does the reaches the climax.The supporting cast is absolutely wonderful. Jack Warden should've been nominated for a Oscar for his portrayal of Mickey. He is the last person that Newman wants to deal with. James Mason is also excellent as Newman's opponent. His character along with the others are strong in appeal because we, as the audience get a sense that Mason is going to win this case because he has a bigger team than Newman and Warden. Just as I mention above, the movie pulls a fast one on itself once again.David Mamet, who is a playwright author have written a brilliant screenplay. The dialogue is sharp, crisp, and explicit with meaning. When the characters begin to talk in the court and outside the court, you can hear these people talk the way they are meant to talk. The language is striking with the characters judging each with knowledge. Mamet's script is read like a book. Each scene is like a page in a book, with new and rich dialogue. These characters are believable and plausible because they are city-people with city lives. There's a lot to be said about the themes in The Verdict. One of those significant themes is redemption and manipulation. Throughout the entire movie, Galvin is trying to rebuild his reputation as a good lawyer. Meanwhile, Mason's character is also trying to rebuild the case on his terms. The end product is something extraordinary. There's are several moments when Galvin trembles in fear because he dreads for the worst to come. His anxiety gets the worst because he fears for his identity as a lawyer. Toward the end of the movie, Newman give a beautiful written speech toward the court and jury about having justice in their hearts. That's the one thing I'll never forget that scene. Newman doesn't play out his character. He acts it out. That's why I think his performance is award-winning. He acts in desperation as the character. You see it in his face that's he's acting as Frank Galvin. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ 4 stars.

He's all washed up and dejected, and is an alcoholic to boot, reduced to handing out his card at funeral services. His good friend Mickey Morrissey (Jack Warden) has thrown him a bone, however a possible medical negligence case that an expert witness has told Frank should be a slam dunk. This motivates Frank to lift himself out of his personal abyss and fight for the kind of justice that he still cares about, while restoring his self respect in the process. He decides that instead of settling, he will take the case to trial, which will prove to be a challenge.It's been said that the late, great director Sidney Lumet was particularly strong when it came to working with actors, and he gets a wonderful performance out of Newman, one of the actor's all time best. The story (adapted for the screen by David Mamet, based on the novel by Barry Reed) may not always be credible, but it's utterly compelling and is extremely well told. If nothing else, the film does score on an emotional level, without ever going overboard into melodrama. Music (by Johnny Mandel), editing (by Peter C. Frank), and cinematography (by Andrzej Bartkowiak) are all first rate.In addition to the excellent Warden, the supporting cast is full of fine actors who bring their A game Charlotte Rampling as Laura Fischer, the new acquaintance in Frank's life, James Mason as the smart and crafty attorney Ed Concannon, Milo O'Shea as the judge, Lindsay Crouse as former admitting nurse Kaitlin Costello Price, Edward Binns as the bishop, Julie Bovasso as nurse Maureen Rooney, Roxanne Hart and James Handy as the victims' sister and brother-in- law, and Wesley Addy and Joe Seneca as doctors. Mason is great fun to watch and Crouse has a powerful scene where she gives some revelatory testimony. Be sure to try and spot Bruce Willis and Tobin Bell as courtroom spectators.Newman, whose final speech to the jury is particularly well done, absolutely shines.

The man who persuades him to take the case is a fellow associate named Mickey Morrisey (played by Jack Warden in a great supporting performance).This was to me one of Newman's top performances of his career in a captivating portrayal. Director Sidney Lumet has crafted a courtroom drama masterpiece that to me came out to be one of his greatest films, and his best courtroom drama film since his first movie that came out in 1957 12 Angry Men.This movie compares to courtroom movie classics like To Kill a Mockingbird, A Few Good Men, Amistad, A Time to Kill, and many more.

Another is his and Lindsay Crouse's touching looks when they are speaking in the children's playground. I truly love this movie, and supporting efforts of Jack Warden, Charlotte Rampling, Joe Seneca, and the not liked judge marvel to this day. Much of the beauty I believe is in the understated performances and subtlety of the delivery. That the Oscar's snubbed this makes me only respect the actors and director more. And since 1982/1983 I have never looked at the Oscars given since with much measure. I was glad to see it again recently and smiled humbly when it was given a 4 of 4 stars by the showing carrier. It is truly deserving of that rating. Another good piece of Newman's work that is often underrated is Nobody's Fool. "},{"Title":"There are no other cases.

You can doubt me on this but you can check it, Newman was knocking down a case of beer a day whether he was working or not. However shortly before making this film, Newman found a new energy by getting involved in car racing, and he brought a renewed sense of enthusiasm and spirit to his acting. Director Sidney Lumet challenged Newman to really let go and find himself in the character of Frank Galvin, and the result was outstanding.As far as courtroom drama goes, there's not much of it in a film with a title like The Verdict. It's more about the story of one man's attempt at finding redemption after being set up for failure a few years earlier. Newman is at his finest as he wrestles his inner demons trying to do 'the right thing' by his client. Moments of doubt enter, and it's the see-saw swings in Newman's performance that make this one of his finest roles.Of course the movie takes liberties in the writing department; it seemed unbelievable to me that the judge (Milo O'Shea) would interject himself into the proceedings the way he did by coming out against Newman's character. I guess that's why you have to watch these pictures as entertainment rather than a representation of real life drama. Still, the story will have you rooting for the underdog attorney who rises to the occasion to make good on his promise - The weak have gotta have somebody fight for 'em.

As anyone who is familiar with the pattern of an underdog's courtroom victory, THE VERDICT is strictly following the procedure, Newman plays Frank Galvin, a washed-out ambulance chaser who receives a wake-up call in his fifties, stands up for his client just for once, for justice. Needless to say it is a lopsided trial, Frank and his aid-cum-mentor Mickey (Warden), whose plaintiff is a woman in a vegetative state, versus two cocky defendants (both well-respected doctors) and their stellar defense team, led by a top-notch attorney Ed Concannon (Mason). Apart from his omni-competent opponent, Frank has to endured&#x8;&#x8; a worst-case scenario during his rushed preparation for the trial, the disappearance of a key witness, an uncooperative insider, a maledictory judge (O'Shea), a questionable deponent (Seneca), a hostile client (the plaintiff's brother in law) who takes umbrage at Frank's arbitrary turn-down of a handsome settlement from the defendant for their medical negligence. And it is a miracle he could still squeeze some time to have a fling with a mysterious divorc√©e Laura (Rampling). Things will nonetheless turns to a rosy side for Frank, as his trials and tribulations will eventually pay off, which doesn't prevent one from sensing frustration to witness all the paddings before a bleak light of hope comes to the rescue, a dogged Frank fortuitously grabs a clue lead to a game-changer in the accident, but meanwhile an unexpected betrayal is the last blow to complicate the case. And the ending with an prolonged and irritating ringing of the telephone, does certify a stark love-or-hate stance for its audiences. However, Newman is impeccable here, he is a pampered child living in an adult's body, strives for his last chance to revive his life, a salvation of his ill-fated past, during the taxing process, he also begins to examine himself, to overcome his weakness (a terrific rendition of a panic attack) and reflect his goodness from the pestilent barriers around him and around us too, one long- take of him making a phone call with his adversary manifests Newman's top-tier stretch in bringing authentic force of emerging into his character. Preciously, the film is not an outward feel-good film, Rampling's stern-cum-icy presence and Laura's underdeveloped storyline mars the narrative but at the same time mirrors Frank's own rite-of-passage, so we might not feel much relieved when at the end of the day he won the case, it intrigues us more after the victory, what is next for Frank? James Mason is Oscar-nominated along with Newman and the film in toto seized five nominations (including BEST PICTURE and DIRECTOR), his malevolent silver-tongue and smug sanctimony is spot-on, a paradigm of the miasma of our legal system. But Warden in my opinion is also Oscar-worthy, restrained yet faithfully being a helping hand and a firm buttress for both Frank and the spectators!

He falls in love with a woman (Charlotte Rampling) who turns out to be not all that she appears, and receives counsel from his long-time friend and partner (Jack Warden). Meanwhile, the defense attorney (James Mason) prepares to decimate Newman in what seems to be an open-and-shut case.I called this film a courtroom thriller, but that's actually misleading. The Verdict is much more a character study of middle age male desperation than it is a legal suspense film. There are many scenes of Newman poring over details of the case and gathering evidence, but all of these do more to develop his character than keep us engaged in the trial itself. The actual trial is dealt with in a couple of dismissive scenes, and the outcome, when it arrives, feels anticlimactic. That is until the final scene of the movie, when we realize that the verdict of the film's title is referring to something completely different than what we thought it was for most of the film's running time.It's certainly a very accomplished movie, but it is slow, talky and a bit too gloomy for its own good.

This more conventional courtroom drama is consistently solid throughout, but it lacks a punch that could've made it even better. It's essentially a classic redemption story, but it's dealt with such subtlety that it's incredibly hard to emotionally connect with, though easy to empathise. While it handles the material strongly, the case itself feels interchangeable with any other case as it lacks political or personal significance to society or the protagonist.Granted, Paul Newman gives a strong performance as always, even if it does lack identifiable moments. It has impressive production value with a lush colour palette especially in the wide angles but it doesn't use them often enough. Mamet's script spends too much time dodging sentiment, exposition and clich√©s (if hitting conventions) and neglects to fill the gap with some unique charm to make it special. It's certainly not unsatisfying and it's definitely engaging, but it is underwhelming.

Poignant performance by Paul Newman, absolutely deserving of the Best Actor Oscar. Particularly notable supporting performances by James Mason, Jack Warden, and Miles O'Shea. The rest of the cast deserve honorable mentions all around. In general, a very strong cast.The brilliance of this movie is how well Frank Galvin's despair and desperation are conveyed by Newman.Another reviewer commented that it was unrealistic for Galvin to grow a conscience in the short time he visits his client in the nursing home. This is pivotal point in the plot and worthy of some analysis. What that reviewer fails to account for is that we're told (by Jack Warden, in a monologue about Frank's life to Charlotte Rampling) that Frank was idealistic before he sank into a bottle and began malfunctioning as a lawyer and a human being. In the nursing home scene, he wasn't growing a conscience. He was unearthing the one he'd buried under years of boozing and self-loathing.I actually think it's one of the most powerful scenes in the movie, and Newman does a great job, with single line (I'm her attorney) and body language to communicate the waning excitement of a fat payday, to one of profound sadness about her and his own failings as he was preparing to exploit her destroyed life for a profit.The movie has a period-look to it that is very late 70s. The winter landscape of the Boston neighborhoods is depressing. The smokey clubs, bars, dark paneled law chambers, Frank's threadbare office and apartment, all have a feeling of darkness that reflects the cynicism of the era. It's ugly scenery, beautifully captured and perfect for the movie's context.This is a dialog heavy, character-driven movie that many moviegoers will reject for slow pace and lack of action.

In the case of The Verdict, it goes even further into the realms of friendship and faith and redemption. For me, it is the friendship between Mick and Frank as played by my favorite character actor, Jack Warden, and Paul Newman respectively that is at the heart of the film.

Newman makes a few misfires in the courtroom that embarrass him and it becomes apparent that his own reputation is a drag on him, with even the judge showing little respect. The courtroom eventually comes to grips with the truth. Frank's summation is restrained but heartfelt. I found the movie riveting and had great respect for what the justice system can achieve even when obstructed by those who would rather not shake that system when justice is crying to be heard.

This is a well done courtroom drama, even if it is one that had the potential to be better. There are a few more things that could be picked on - the occasional lack of realism and the abrupt ending in particular. Even so, this is solid stuff, with quality acting and the skills that Lumet possesses as a director to carry it through.

What is so good about The Verdict however, is the film is not really about the morality and the out come of the case per s√© but rather the evolution of Paul Newman's troubled character Frank Galvin against that backdrop. Newman in a very moving and convincing performance takes us on the journey of his triumphs, trials and tribulations. His summation speech is particularly memorable. Jack Warden as always plays an excellent mentor and the consistently great James Mason (The Boys From Brazil) is also very good as the trial lawyer opposing Galvin. Highly recommended for the performances of all three principal actors.

And what a good choice it was. First, I want to say, although it appears to be a courtroom drama movie..it's not. It's a movie about a man's character with the use of a courtroom and a lawyer to show it. It's definitely quite different from Newman's typical movies. This movie is about the character development of Francis and his descent and ascent in his personal and professional life, how the former affects the latter. It's quite introspective, which I believe he quoted in the featurette on the DVD. We see a man struggling with his sense of self worth and hit rock bottom with the typical use of alcohol as a means to get there. Newman is fabulous in this movie, we see him raw and vulnerable, his acting is remarkable. His mentor, played by Jack Warden, is also worth noting. Although their relationship is one that is typical for any movie of this kind, Warden is extremely believable.. Of course, it's a dated movie (1982) but for its time, it's worth watching, or even purchasing if you can get it for a discount. My rating 7/10 stars...

Is the movie too long, yes. Are there a few scenes that could have been cut, yes. Yet, in my opinion, it has a place in my library for the key scene that is my header. Concannon has just used his superior legal skills to disallow the eyewitness nurse testimony that would have won the case for Galvin. Galvin's case now collapses, realistically, Concannon annihilates Galvin due to his huge staff and frankly his mole inside Galvin's office Rampling. Galvin's closing statement speaks for all the people watching; how tired we are of the minutia of legal rulings being used to protect evil people, in this case, the Archdiocese and their dangerously incompetent doctor. The summation points out what many people forget the law is the bastard child of philosophy. Ethics were the sub discipline of philosophy that laws were drawn from. Here Galvin uses ethical principles to ask the jury to, implicitly, supersede the legalities that shield a crippling, negligent doctor and the powerful Church standing behind him. When you re-watch it listen to his argument Ethics over the Law. How tired we all are of the law being subverted to protect the rich and the powerful. The best part of the movie and frankly, friends, why I am a philosopher and not a lawyer.The movie is one long existential path back for Galvin. When we meet him, he is a drunken ambulance chaser being ejected out of a funeral where he is trying to shake down the grieving family for business. Warden throws him this bone of a case that is sure to be settled out of court. When he thinks he has a good expert doctor witness, the decision point ensues, take the money or fight? The poor vegetable's family, put into a coma by an idiot doctor who operated not reading her chart that she'd eaten just before, is livid and attacks Galvin. I admired the move though everyone, including Warden, think Galvin has flipped out. Concannon, played brilliantly by James Mason, has a whole team of lawyers and unbeknownst to Galvin has planted a spy in his office as an assistant. The film's bravery to defy expectations and have Concannon kick Galvin's butt destroying witness after witness, scaring his expert doctor away and secreting the eyewitness nurse who falsified the patient chart, at the doctor's behest, is stunningly one of a kind for a legal movie. The movie shows the triumph of the parent over the wayward son. Ethics, that is the core of Galvin's summation; ignore what the legal rigmarole orders you to do, apply ethical law inside of you for the irreparably injured vegetable in the bed and her grieving family. The movie is the best delineation of how lawyers often are lost within the minutia of rulings and precedents forgetting the ethical code that these decisions were putatively predicated upon. Watch the movie for excellent acting, the brave walk back into life by Galvin and for the triumph of God given ethical principles inside everyone of us over ciphers lost within their law books never to return who personify losing the forest for the trees. When the precedents take you to evil, they are wrong end of discussion. The reason the film resonates is this ethical conquering of greed and power by their using the laws' esoteric rules to cover their collective butts. He finds his way back, they reward his faith in their ability to transcend the corruption that is human law and government. An existential redemption with a glorious crescendo of a burst of pure spiritual Light. The relationship between Right and the law has always been tenuous, at best, given the rampant corruption. These are the geniuses who gave us the Dredd Scott decision that said black people were worth a fraction of white people. Take it from a philosopher, don't set your moral compasses by them.

Although I was too young to grasp the legal technicalities and complications that the plot involved, I was still deeply touched by the simple yet powerful story Frank Galvin (Newman), a lawyer who is on the brink of alcoholism and professional bankruptcy, takes a case involving a medical malpractice in which a young woman who was about to give birth has fallen in a terminal coma. Although the defendants are prepared to offer a good amount of money to the victim's family as an out-of-court-settlement, Galvin refuses to accept it, going for a trial instead; this is done against the advice of everybody, including his partner, the presiding judge, and even the plaintiffs themselves. Galvin sees this case as both an opportunity to show his capabilities again after many years of idleness, as well as a rightful struggle to punish those responsible for committing a shameful act who are now trying to get away with it lightly. Against him stands the formidable defense lawer E.J. Concannon (Mason) and his well-organised team, and Galvin's chances to win get bleaker day after day... Amidst all this, Galvin bumps onto an attractive woman (Rampling) who complicates his already complex life further.Viewing the film again now with the mind and experience of someone in his early 30s, I can make a more balanced, thorough, and accurate review. However, it is astonishing that my conclusion is the same as it was more than 20 years ago The film is superb, and Paul Newman definitely gives an amazing performance. Not that the remaining cast is not good Everybody does a great job, with Mason being first among equals. Yet, Newman is simply unforgettable, as he does an excellent job in portraying this lawyer who manages to get back from the brink of disaster, and show his true form-no matter what.Some might say that the plot is simplistic.

None of the principal players in the legal system is portrayed as a real character. They just do not act like real lawyers and Judges would act.Paul Newman plays a down-and-out lawyer who takes on a malpractice case against a big Catholic hospital. James Mason plays the defense lawyer who is willing to stoop to anything to oppose Newman's effort to obtain justice for his clients. SPOILERS The problem is that the filmmakers have these lawyers and the Judge in the case do things which real lawyers or Judges would never do. For example, when Newman receives a generous settlement offer from the hospital, he turns it down without even consulting his clients. This is such a blatant ethical violation that the film loses credibility already at this point. Any attorney practicing in this fashion would be severely sanctioned.The defense lawyer marshals all the people in his large firm to work on this one case. He asks them to drop everything else they are doing, including canceling planned vacations, to concentrate on this one case. This is ludicrous; no big firm could stay in business by ignoring all its other clients to concentrate on one case. Granted, it is an important case, but it is still only one case. More realistically, in an important case the lead attorney would typically have an attorney helping him as second chair, and perhaps a para-legal to run errands as needed, but to pull every single attorney in the firm off their other work defies credulity.And then there is the business of planting a spy in the defense camp. Of course this is beyond the pale ethically. Mason is such a sleazy character here that he is unpleasant to watch on the screen. This would have been a much better movie if Mason had been portrayed realistically, doing whatever he could within the law and Newman then has to surmount these obstacles.Worst of all is the unholy alliance entered into between the Judge and the defense team. The Judge's ire is raised when Newman turns down the settlement offer. Now, it is certainly not unusual for Judges to encourage parties to settle. But when Newman wants a trial, the Judge should allow him to have it. Instead, he does whatever he can to thwart Newman's efforts to present his case. When Newman unexpectedly comes up with the witness who can help his case, the defense attorney vociferously objects. He is silenced by a stern glance from the Judge, and the viewer is led to believe that the Judge is now going to allow the truth to come out. How disappointing, then, when we discover that the Judge actually silences Mason so as not to draw undue attention to the witness, and he then goes on to rule the testimony inadmissible.The sad thing is that there are issues here which need to be aired. We have seen in the sexual abuse scandals that have recently come to light that the Catholic Church has indeed been guilty of covering up misconduct of its Priests. So it is not surprising that it would also cover up misconduct by its doctors. Further, I am told by a leading malpractice lawyer that these days the hospitals will, in more cases than not, attempt to falsify evidence. What they do is substitute another patient's records for the plaintiff's records, and submit it as the plaintiff's own records to show that nothing improper was done. The thinking seems to be that they are going to lose anyway if they present the actual records, so why not take a chance and hope they won't be caught?So the problem with the film is not that the hospital is crooked, but rather that it portrays the defense lawyer as being part and parcel of the chicanery. No lawyer would keep his license to practice law after something like this. In actuality, the client submits the doctored evidence as real and the lawyer is kept in the dark.If you want to see a good film about the legal system, there are many to choose from. A short list includes `Inherit the Wind', `To Kill a Mockingbird', `Anatomy of a Murder', `Witness for the Prosecution', `Judgment at Nuremberg', `Breaker Morant', `My Cousin Vinny', and `Amistad'.

The supporting characters are mostly good as well, and director Sidney Lumet handles the material very smoothly. However, I felt that David Mamet's screenplay was only ordinary in its approach to the way Newman's character gets this chance at redemption in the form of an easy case. To me, nothing inventive really occurs or for that matter, nothing too dramatic that sucked me in and kept me riveting the entire time. I must admit, some of the twists Mamet injects into the story were good, but we've seen them before in other dramas just like this in a very tired, bloated genre. I don't want to take anything from Newman's fine performance, but The Verdict feels only like a two hour version of Law and Order; and I can watch that for free. This movie is simply average, nothing more and nothing less. And while it is far from a poor film, I just had so much more expectations from a director like Lumet and a writer like Mamet.

He might not be the best of lawyers and always say 'yes' to a drink, or two, or three. He has come to crossroads. This is something very important.It's an alright flick with Paul Newman. A nice story really and very interesting. It's not a rarity all these lawyers, their lawsuits and the big name companies but it's some nice entertainment. Newman as handsome as ever and acting as well as ever too.Downside is that you've seen it all before. All this. It's not something new. I don't know what it was like when it was released and was screened on cinemas, but it's just not that special, except for Newman of course. Brilliant actor. He is this film's difference between bad and alright.

Charlotte Rampling is stunning as Paul Newman's seedy girlfriend. James Mason is James Mason Templar. The judge is your worst nightmare. The young couple with the vegetative state on their hands is you and me wanting to split town with some sense of having tried. Our only hope is lawyer Newman, and he looks okay to us, in his trench coat and silver hair, his file cabinet and desk and old archy office. But we are small folk easily swayed. Unbeknownst to us, our guy plays pinball for breakfast and drinks eggs in his beer. Our guy skips business meetings for happy hour. Our guy is a drunk.Nothing good can come of this....

James Mason, as the defence attorney, also does well in what is at times actually a weak script.The thing is about these kinds of trial films is that, once you know who the good guys and the bad guys are, you can predict the ending.  In this case it wasn't as predictable, but I guess when you have a black and white trial verdict, there's not much else you can do.This does look a little dated now, but is still worth seeing.

I would not say it is the best courtroom drama of all time as others have said (see A Few Good Men with Tom Cruise).  Nor would I say that it is Newman's best film - it doesn't have that upbeat, cool, comic quality that characterizes many of his films such as Cool Hand Luke, Butch Cassidy... and more recently, Where the Money Is,  Overall it is a pretty good film - 6/10.The one major error in the plot of the film that I noticed was the timing of the incident that the trial was all about.  In Kaitlin Costello's testimony she states that she was the admitting nurse in 1976.  The check that Laura Fischer receives from Edward J. Concannon is dated February, 1982 (same as the release year of the movie).  That would make the operation six years earlier.  However, several times in the film it is mentioned that the operation took place four years ago.  So within the film, there is a discrepancy of two years from the operation to the trial.

It feels like Newman plays his character as either depressed or hyperventilating -- nothing else (bi-polar?). I only see one moment, when he asks Kaitlin help me?, where he significantly breaks out of this pattern. We haven't seen Newman in this mold before, but that doesn't make it less monotonous. Mason plays Mason and Warden plays Warden as always. Laura Fischer doesn't have much of a role, and plays it correctly as not much. Milo O'Shea plays the judge ambiguously as cute but mean. Only Lindsay Crouse does a really good job as Kaitlin. If I were on the jury, I would believe her absolutely too.Now for the plot *** Major spoilers *** In refusing the $210,000,Frank is clearly putting his own redemption (as a lawyer) above that of his client. Only way too late does he try to correct this.The love interest, Charlotte, secretly works for defense attorney Ed Concannon (James Mason), but stops being a spy before telling Ed about Kaitlin. You see her staring at a phone, but not calling him. Indeed, she secretly gives Frank the letter that allowed him to trace Kaitlin. Because of this, the jury was able to hear the other side - that the doctors had changed the one hour to nine hours. Yet at the very end, Frank refuses to answer Charlotte's phone calls and listen to her side - that she stopped spying in time. This verdict of Frank against even listening to Charlotte belies Franks closing argument about a prayer for justice. So I don't see that Frank is redeemed at all. "}]
