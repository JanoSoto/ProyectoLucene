Having said that, the whole cast look to be having a ball and it really comes across on-screen. Rose-tinted views of Paris, alongside near slapstick sketches in the States, makes for a fast-paced tale that you can just sit back and enjoy.Mickey (Crystal) travels to France to bury his father, only to find that the airline has accidentally sent the body to the wrong airport. Ellen (Winger) is the airline official sent to assure Mickey that everything possible is being done. Despite meeting under such an awkward situation, soon enough they are walking the streets of Paris together and romance blossoms. But with lives on different sides of the Atlantic, there are going to be a lot sacrifices...And if the movie ever begins to feel as though it might be getting bogged down in the romance, it steps out to the present day restaurant scene where friends are sharing the story, each telling a different part and eager to find out what happened in the end.An entertaining, funny and above all, charming story.

This time, though, it is Debra Winger rather than Meg Ryan who is opposite him. But Winger does nicely in the Ryan part and Crystal does nicely too.Crystal is a basketball referee who is accompanying his father's dead body to Normandy for burial. The airline sends the body to Switzerland accidentally, and Winger is the airline official who smooths Crystal's ruffled feathers. She even attends the funeral, and soon the two of them are exploring the sites of Paris together. They get on well, but Crystal has to return to the U.S. But he returns and proposes marriage. After an initial delay, Winger accepts the proposal, and we watch the resulting marriage.It is an intensely felt love affair, but it isn't smooth. She does not like losing her high paying job in Paris to return to the U.S., nor that he is going around the country most of the time as a referee at games. He tries to work at a different job, and finds her father (William Hickey) driving him batty with his senility (he keeps repeating the Toyota automobile slogan from the 1990s). And there are more serious problems about infertility, including a funny routine when Crystal is repeatedly delayed running to a fertility clinic.The story of their love affair and marriage is related by Joe Mantegna, Richard Masur, Julie Kavner, and John Spencer, at a dinner party in an Italian restaurant. The personalities and marriage situations of the friends of our hero and heroine get exposed too during the dinner. All of the friends give good performances as does Hickey and Robert Constanza as the world's most philosophically charming waiter. Listen to him describing various drinks.The film is a feel good movie, and does well as such.

However alone the way the casket is lost and he's stuck in Paris, where he meets another single woman (Debra Winger) who's under similarly unfortunate circumstances.They go out, have a fun time, and then resume their normal lives. Crystal goes back to basketball in the US but soon finds he can't concentrate and keeps thinking about his relationship.Eventually they reunite and get married but it's an uphill struggle.The movie kind of reminded me of GoodFellas (!) due to its structure and how it focused on the downfall of the marriage. Like Ray Liotta's marriage in GoodFellas it's not all peachy like most Hollywood films portray them as being.My favorite sequence is when Crystal is transporting his semen to a hospital and gets stopped by a traffic cop. Some very funny moments like this, as well as good chemistry between the stars and an interesting narrative structure, make it a worthwhile - if not particularly memorable - romantic comedy, better than many others in its genre. At least it's entertaining and believable.

It has some great comic scenes, however, I would never call this movie a Romantic Comedy. If you are expecting a real comedy, then you are likely to be disappointed, because it doesn't play strictly for laughs. To me this movie seems more like a lighthearted version of An Affair to Remember (or its superior predecessor, Love Affair). I watched it with my wife, and I held her hand and wanted to hold her in my arms while we watched the movie. During an argument scene, I remarked, This is real, and my wife readily agreed. Admittedly, we both laughed hysterically at the pigeon sequence!I confess that I am a romantic. I hoped that Mickey and Ellen would get together, but I was not certain they would. That lack of certainty was maintained until the end for me. Even so, I have nothing against predictable movies. In film, as in life, it is the journey that is important, not the arrival at your destination. This movie provides a journey that is creative in the device it uses to convey the story, as well as in the unexpected plot twists. Is the climactic scene a little fairy-tale like? Maybe, but so what? I liked it, especially when the basketball reunion scene is followed by the arrival of Mickey and Ellen at the restaurant. The final scene is funny, clever, poignant, and romantic. It brings this delightful tale to a well-deserved and equally delightful end.

Liz comments that how she and Andy met must be the oddest ever (a fax had one digit off in the fax number and went to Andy by mistake). Andy says no, how Mickey met Ellen is the weirdest. They met because she helped him bury his father. That starts the friends telling the story of Mickey and Ellen.Some critics consider this way of telling the story and the plot stale and schmaltzy; but it is so well done that I could care less.The film genre is romantic comedy; this film's strength is the comedy part of that term. I could give examples but comedy is best when the punchline (or its visual equivalent) is unexpected. Let me just say that one of my favorite bits starts with the focus on an organist going through the motions of preparing to play serious music.Billy Crystal is known to be a serious basketball fan and in part the film is like a documentary about refereeing NBA games, with a huge number of basketball stars playing themselves. I was bemused at the end of the credits when the standard disclaimer came up saying that all the characters and names in the film were fictitious. Not hardly in this film.I should mention that Cynthia Stevenson's hysterically tearful performance as Liz listening to Mickey's and Ellen's highs and lows was great.I also loved the sound track. Ella Fitzgerald singing April in Paris is so great; also, Billy Holiday doing the opening Our Love Is Here To Stay. David Sanborn's saxophone version of the Star Spangled Banner is also particularly great.My one quibble is that I found Debra Winger's voice very sexy in 1982's Officer and a Gentleman and she didn't sound the same in 1995's Forget Paris. I probably don't sound the same as I did 13 years ago either.

It does not shirk from showing the real difficulties marriage has - or the anti-climax marriage can prove after the romance of courtship. I also applaud its realism - many matters don't prove right in the end in real life - nor in this movie - no matter how much they try. Reconciliations fade in light of fundamental issues that exist from the beginning of the marriage. However, as comedy, the movie usually seemed lame - it had its moments but they were too few. And as drama, there weren't enough moments of real suspense. As a romance, it fails - it's too realistic and I never felt any magic in Debra Winger's character. She was fairly nice, fairly attractive, but rather humdrum in personality. We are taken down a lane familiar to married couples - with all the aggravations real life produces and an occasional chuckle. The movie is the rather tedious alternative to happily ever after - and though the movie rings more truly than happily ever after,it's not as satisfying. Very little would be needed to darken this movie into An Unmarried Woman. I preferred Mr. Saturday Night for its dark look at the life of a Milton Berle sort of character - at least it was unfamiliar and interesting territory - this isn't. I do wish I could say otherwise and again think well of Crystal in one respect he doesn't sugarcoat his tale.

Things don't work out between Crystal's Mickey Gordon- and Debra Winger's Ellen and many of the scenes with them arguing are not fun to watch. It fact, some are downright uncomfortable. I'm not a fan of Winger's low and raspy voice, nor seeing marriages crumble.Thus, my favorite parts of this film were all in the beginning, especially when Mickey was an NBA referee. A few basketball stars got a chance to act, too, showing they should stick with sports.

The humor does have a few gross moments, however, apart from that, it's all hilarious, if you're into the sarcastic, at times cynical, type of material. Hardly any gags or jokes fall flat, throughout it. It's well-acted, and the characters are good. In addition, it's highly involving, and you find yourself caring, not just laughing, during this. Part of the emotion comes from the honesty of this, that it isn't your usual romantic comedy of boy who looks like a male model meets female lead who appears to have stepped right off the train from Glamourville, and so on and so forth. This has ups *and* downs, and goes beyond the superficial level of the Hollywood pap that we all know, without forgetting what genre of film it is. The story is imaginative and holds surprises.

Here is an accomplished actress who seizes roles with a palpable life force when she is in the right vehicle. However, Winger seems lost playing against the stand-up shenanigans of Billy Crystal, and consequently they never really connect in any believable way. Much of the blame has to be placed on Crystal, who not only starred but also directed and co-wrote the film with Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel. He seems intent on doing a retread of When Harry Met Sally but this time following a seemingly incompatible couple through marital discord.Crystal plays Mickey Gordon, an NBA referee who tries to abide by his estranged father's wishes to be buried in France. The airline has unfortunately lost the casket, and their Paris-based customer relations executive Ellen Andrews tries to correct things for Mickey. Of course, they fall in love since it is Paris, and they get married almost immediately. Complications ensue with Mickey on the road and Ellen unable to conceive a baby. The central conceit of the film is its framing device, a dinner where a group of their friends congregate and share their remembrances of Mickey and Ellen's courtship and marital problems. How they are able to relay such intimate details is never really addressed since it's a plotting contrivance we are supposed to accept.The other problem is that Crystal is not really acting here but performing his comedy routine as Mickey. Many of his lines sound overly familiar with many of the jokes having a forced feeling, and the role is virtually interchangeable with his Harry from the earlier film. Nevertheless, there are some truly funny bits, such as the running gag with Ellen's senile father (played by a befuddled William Hickey) repeating road signs in the car and the scene with the pigeon getting stuck to the side of Ellen's head. But it's not nearly enough. A solid supporting cast has been assembled as the friends - Joe Mantegna, Julie Kavner (particularly funny), Richard Masur, Cathy Moriarty, John Spencer, Cynthia Stevenson - though they act more like a chorus to the proceedings. The inevitable ending feels hollow since the relationship never felt that resonant. Despite some attempts at serious moments during the second half, this is the type of lightweight film that doesn't linger too long in one's memory. The 2000 DVD has no extras.

It exposes all the warts & blemishes & dirty socks that plague an average dysfunctional couple but does it in a funny way that never feels upsetting, disturbing or depressing. Still, don't see it with anyone you're remotely romantic with because it will certainly dispel the charm.On the other hand, if you are already in a dysfunctional relationship, maybe on the verge of a divorce or breakup, then definitely SEE THIS MOVIE. It can be cathartic, better than any $200/hr marriage therapist. After all, what do you have to lose, you miserable schlep?Told in an interesting, non-linear, Citizen Kane way (i.e. told in flashback through the subjective interpretations of different characters), it carries a mounting sense of mystery and suspense that keeps you guessing until the very end. That's what separates it from the standard dysfunctional rom-com (romance on the Orient Express?). Agatha Christie would be proud.Where this movie falls slightly short, and the reason why I'm docking it a few stars, is the chemistry between Billy Crystal and Debra Winger. Though both fine actors, I never found them convincing as a couple, not the way we saw with Billy Crystal & Meg Ryan a few years earlier in When Harry Met Sally. But sheesh, nothing will ever touch that movie, it was so perfect.Forget Paris is a great movie to watch and remind yourself that love isn't always Valentine's Day & rose-covered mattresses. But love can still be an interesting ride. It's hard to think of many other films that achieve this.

It works on all levels.  It's basically a flashback film as told by the participants, but you don't feel like you're flashing back all the time; in fact, you are just as captivated as the character to whom the story is being told, and you can't wait for the next flashback, but you don't feel stuck in it.  This one works a lot like Fried Green Tomatoes in that respect, except that there's more suspense in the flashbacks here.  Also, using a cast of storytellers really helps keep it fresh throughout.Debra Winger does a great job, and Billy Crystal was his usual charming and funny self, and there really wasn't a weak link in the entire movie.  The ending was excellent.  The comedy was very sharp and the drama was heavy when needed.  I rate this one above When Harry Met Sally, but don't compare the two as this is a story of two people in love who have obstacles to overcome, and the storyline is nothing like WHMS at all.  The only similarity is Billy Crystal in a romantic comedy, and the comedy is better here and the romance is much better.  Kudos to the late William Hickey (who was also a famous acting coach) for his funny portrayal of Winger's feeble-minded dad and also Cynthia Stevenson who played the woman that's being told the story. Buy it --- you'll want to watch it more than once.  Helluva ending also.

After a romance in Paris they marry, the story follows their ups and their downs.Billy Crystal is effortlessly funny when he has good material and a good vehicle.  He shows this most years recently by towering over the Oscars with his jokes and one liners.  However he cannot totally make an average film worth watching, even if he can make it better.  Here the plot is interesting &#150; it strays away from a normal romantic film by following Mickey and Ellen through the bad times and good times in their relationship.  However it suffers from a lack of energy &#150; at times it almost feels ponderous.  The restaurant interludes help keep it moving but it doesn't quite have the spark that `When Harry Met Sally' had.Crystal tries hard and has plenty of clever material and witty remarks to mark.  However it's not as sharp as you'd hope it to be &#150; some of it feels like the man has mellowed with age.  Happily he does bring the laughs regularly.  Winger isn't as good and the chemistry between her and crystal just isn't there to the extent it needed to be.  Mantegna is solid, as are Spencer, Moriarty and Kavner (Marge!).  Costanzo has only a few lines but is very funny as the waiter (`it's like me&#133;etc').  The array of basketball stars is fun to watch and makes Crystal seem more relaxed and funnier.Overall this is quite witty and fans of Crystal's style will enjoy it, however it lacks energy and spark for most of the film.

Billy Crystal does his usual schtick as he romances Debra Winger, though the structure is pure Woody Allen - the whole film told by a group of friends at a party - and the foreign funeral set-up half-inched somewhat obviously from Billy Wilder's underrated Avanti!. The result is somewhat unsatisfactory. It's certainly no Moonstruck or Broadway Danny Rose, but it's not even When Harry Met Sally - and the Paris-set sections were disappointingly brief considering I'd just returned from my travels and was secretly hankering for a glossily-photographed sight-seeing tour. There are comic compensations, though. Playing a basketball referee, Crystal's meltdown on the court is the obvious highlight - along with his senile father-in-law's fondness for regurgitating ad slogans. You asked for it... you got it.

Mickey and Ellen both love each other more than anyone in the world, only they are selfish and allow their career status to provide their happiness. Like many people today. And when one is up the other is miserable.Of course there are moments when the couple is happy in marriage. But the path keeps getting rough around each corner. But this movie never forgets what it is and that is a comedy. So it features a great moment, involving a bird, glue, and Ellen in an SUV. Absolutely priceless scene.But in between the laughter we really are waiting to see the make up, the happily ever after. But this movie never settles for the easy way out. It never allows us to buy that it is just this one thing that is causing these problems.But knows it is just that in life and in every turn we have to conform to it or just abandon the path. Whether or not Mickey and Ellen both learn and mature you'll have to rent it to see. But this one of the best romantic comedies I have ever seen.

It is unusual in focusing not on the courtship but on the course of the couple's early married life. I guess I objected to the fact that separation seems such an easy option for this couple when they aren't feeling self fulfilled. Plenty enough of that, alas, in real life. The method of story telling is certainly unique, and somewhat effective, as it's done in flashback at an Italian restaurant by their friends, each supplying a part of the tale as they wait for the couple (who may or may not be together) to join them. The couple meet in Paris when Ellen, an airline official, helps Mickey, a basketball referee, sort out the airline's error in sending his father's body to the wrong destination. They have a romantic whirlwind courtship, seeing all the sights. However, marriage of course proves a big adjustment back in the States, as Ellen misses her successful airline career. Also, Ellen's father, who's a bit senile, comes to live with the newlyweds in their apartment, driving Mickey crazy.Nothing the matter with the cast. Billy Crystal is okay here, though I prefer When Harry Met Sally (not my favorite romantic comedy either). He seems to have a consistent persona of crazy yappiness. As a rule, I really like Debra Winger, but this simply isn't her best role.The movie has some laughs certainly (Mickey's veal ordering rut, for example) and a few good points, such as the father-in-law issue and the fact that the pair do honestly attempt to compromise and make it work, with Mickey for a time sacrificing his travels as referee to be at home with his wife. However, all in all, it's just too contrived and deliberately modern. The young wife who wants her own career fulfillment. Ho, hum. Naturally, the couple has fertility problems. The wild drive where Mickey is racing his semen sample to the fertility clinic is supposedly hilarious but failed to amuse me much. It seemed with its sexual implications such a calculated attempt to elicit a guaranteed laugh. Sort of like the restaurant faked orgasm scene in When Harry Met Sally. The old romantic comedies used to manage quite nicely without this sort of thing. They just don't make them like they used to.At least the film does make the point that marriage isn't just about romance (hence the phrase, forget Paris) but about sacrifice and commitment. So I suppose in a sense, something of a good message. "},{"Title":"Marriage is about both people being equally miserable","Date":"23 October 2007","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" Forget Paris is on some ways reminiscent of the work of Woody Allen. Billy Crystal is, like Allen, a diminutive New Yorker who started as a stand-up comic before moving into acting, and his character in this film, Mickey Gordon, has something in common with Woody's self-deprecating creations. The story of Mickey and his wife, Ellen, is told in a series of flashbacks by a group of acquaintances over a meal in a restaurant; Allen had used a similar technique in his Broadway Danny Rose and was to do so again in Melinda and Melinda, although in that film the stories told were invented ones.Mickey meets Ellen when he flies to France to bury his father, who has expressed the wish to be buried with his old Army comrades who were killed during the war. On arrival in Paris, however, Mickey finds that his father's coffin has been lost. Ellen is the airline official responsible for helping him find it. That sounds like the opening for a zany, screwball-type comedy or a macabre black comedy, but Forget Paris is neither. It is rather a romantic comedy with a difference. Most rom-coms are about courtship, and end with the marriage or engagement of the couple concerned. This one is as much about what comes after marriage as with what leads up to it; the marriage of Mickey and Ellen comes less than halfway through.After the missing coffin is found, Mickey and Ellen have a whirlwind romance in Paris, leading to their marriage and to her leaving her job in Paris to return with him to America. Paris in American films is typically the city of love and romance; one of these, An American in Paris, is referred to a number of times. Mickey even sings one of the songs from that film, Our Love is Here to Stay. The title, Forget Paris, a phrase used a number of times in the course of their marriage, therefore becomes shorthand for We've got to put the courtship phase of our relationship behind us and move on to dealing with the problems of married life together.And Mickey and Ellen have plenty of problems. They are unable to have children, and their relationship is put under stress by their contrasting lifestyles. Ellen, cultured and sophisticated, would prefer to live in Paris, but reluctantly agrees to return to America. Mickey is a basketball referee, which means that he spends much of the time travelling around America, leaving Ellen at home. She tries to persuade him to quit his job so that they can spend more time together, and this leads to quarrels between them. Further strain is caused by the arrival of Ellen's irritating elderly father Arthur. Eventually they separate, and Ellen returns to Paris. The title therefore takes on added significance; can Ellen forget Paris, or will she end up forgetting Mickey? Some reviewers have taken exception to the happy ending, such as James Berardinelli, who accused it of lacking emotional honesty. Of course, it would have been quite possible to turn the story of Mickey and Ellen into a serious study of a failing marriage, but Forget Paris was never intended to be a film of that sort. In my view, a happy ending is the only one possible; an unhappy ending to a romantic comedy would be about as appropriate as a series of strident dissonances at the end of a Mozart symphony. And Forget Paris is clearly designed to be comic, not tragic.The two leading actors are very different in their styles of acting. As I stated, Billy Crystal started as a stand-up comedian, and specialises in comedies. (I would find it difficult to imagine him in a serious film). He was, of course, the star of When Harry Met Sally, one of the best romantic comedies of the eighties. Debra Winger, on the other hand, is not an actress I would normally have associated with comedy. In early films such as Cannery Row or An Officer and a Gentleman she played attractive, vivacious characters, but she later became a rather intense actress, at her best in serious dramas like Betrayed, Shadowlands, Black Widow or A Dangerous Woman. I never cared for that lugubrious romantic tragedy Terms of Endearment, but the fact that Winger won a Best Actress Oscar suggests that a lot of other people liked it.The point of casting two such dissimilar actors may have been to emphasise the contrast in character between Mickey and Ellen, a contrast that would have been lessened if Ellen had been played by an experienced romantic comedy actress such as Meg Ryan, Crystal's co-star in When Harry Met Sally. Winger's performance here suggests that she is not perhaps the world's most naturally gifted comedienne, but she still makes an endearing, if rather earnest, heroine. The difficulties in the Gordons' marriage may stem from the fact that Ellen is a fundamentally more serious person than Mickey, except perhaps where basketball is concerned. (Even the name Mickey, with its associations with Mickey Mouse and taking the mickey, suggests someone less serious than a Michael or even a Mike). Crystal is very funny in this film, and most of the best lines go to him, although there are also some good contributions from the assembled diners. (Marriages don't work when one partner is happy and the other is miserable. Marriage is about both people being equally miserable- that one could be straight out of Woody Allen). There are also some great set pieces, such as the scene in the fertility clinic and the one where Ellen gets a pigeon stuck to her head. Overall, this is an amusing and likable romantic comedy. 7/10 "},{"Title":"forget about a basketball movie","Date":"14 July 2003","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  I thought Forget Paris was going to be more about basketball, but it turned out to be a pretty good movie though as forty something couple Andy (Joe Mantegna) and Liz (Cynthia Stevenson) are about to be married, and as they gather with their friends for dinner not long before the wedding, they are told the story of their mutual friends Mickey (Billy Crystal) and Ellen (Debra Winger) as a cautionary tale of where a relationship can go wrong.
