Witty, acerbic and thoroughly scurrulous. A titled brat with no brains and a very canny artisan who are both wanted by the law reluctantly join forces as highwaymen. Historically only as accurate as it suits the story at the time, it has a surreal quality that is enchanting. If you like intelligent, funny movies with a twist, this one's worth a look. A bit graphic in places, both sexually and in terms of violence, but what's a bit of the clap between friends!? I don't understand how this movie made so little impact on the movie going public but it deserves cult status as far as I am concerned.

This is the story of downtrodden highwayman Plunkett (Robert Carlisle) and Gentleman-fallen-on-hard-times Captain Macleane (Jonny Lee Miller), and how they get together and rob the aristo pigs. Plunkett is a hard nut, but MaCleane is far too polite for that, and thus becomes 'the gentleman highwayman'. He falls in love with Lady Rebecca (Liv Tyler), (who to be frank is the only weak part of the whole shebang) and wants to impress her. The costumes are fantastic. Big, colourful, historically innacurate beautiful togs. Alan Cummings gets all the best threads, and the best lines as Lord Rochester, sporting a very non-18th century eyebrow piercing. The music shifts between swooping glorious choirs and thumping bass-laden techno, which doesn't jarr as you think it should do in a historical film. The script is fast-moving and peppered with modern-day colloquialisms; Merchant Ivory, this is not. There are hilarious parts, disgusting parts, sit-on-the-edge-of-your-seat-and-nibble-your-fingernails parts, but the whole thing chugs along and is wonderfully entertaining throughout.

Unfortunately they are caught as grave robbers and sent to jail, but not until Plunkett has swallowed the ruby. The ruby is their key to freedom, and once they're free, they form a partnership in robbery. Macleane is to pose as a gentleman and find out who is worth robbing, and then simply they rob him (and rob them in style). But Macleane falls in love with the niece/daughter (?) of their first victim, lady Rebecca Gibson (Tyler). And a Mr Chance (Stott) is out to catch them, and his methods are not very nice...Comments A good action flavoured by comedy and adventure. Carlyle and Miller form a good team, with a lot of friction and friendship. And then there is the relationship between Macleane and Rebecca Gibson.

The rich were all made up to the eyeballs with ludicrous hair and cuffs you could hide a poodle in.  They did, however smell a little better than the poor, who were lucky if they made it through the day without a vital appendage falling off in the street.It is to this world that the audience watching Plunkett and Macleane are introduced.  It's not pretty, but it's very believable and prepares you to accept the lengths to which people will go to clamber from the muck to a better life.Thrown together through circumstance, Macleane, a semi-respectable gentleman who spends too much on women and gambling and Plunkett, a common criminal with more than a few tricks up his sleeve, find that they can rob together successfully as partners.  So they do.  A lot.There's a lot of good ideas in the film, primarily the concept of turning the idea of 18th Century English nobility on its head and making it seem little more than an excuse to wear wigs and lipstick.  A refreshing change in these days of Merchant Ivory productions and hey-nonny snooze.Then there's the obligatory love interest, Lady Rebecca (Liv Tyler) and the vicious baddie, in the form of the Thief Taker General Chance, played with sadistic relish by Ken Stott.  Both perform well, but it's up to the two leads, and the chemistry that worked well in Trainspotting to steal the show.  Being Highwaymen, they steal it with ease, commanding each scene with humour and grit in equal proportions.  Some moments of the film are laugh out loud funny, while others border on the disgusting.  Always funny and compelling as an action movie, (the love story is left firmly in second place) Plunkett & Macleane is great fun.  Though the efforts of the excellent cast and director Jake Scott, we have another British hit on our hands.All in all, to blatantly rip off a line from the filmIt was fantastic and I had a bloody good laugh!

However, it very quickly became apparent that this film was trying to be more.Normally, I don't approve of films that try to entertain in as many ways possible. For instance, this film tries to mix action with comedy, romance, lightheartedness and gritty seriousness all at once. Most of the time this sort of approach doesn't work in films (just look at Batman Forever) but I was was pleasantly surprised to see that in this case, they pulled it off.The end result is a highly entertaining film that should appeal to most mature cinemagoers. (However, the weak of stomach should really be warned of one or two scenes.) Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller pull of a brilliant double act and Ken Stott does a excellent villain. This mixed in with superb costumes and a few decent action scenes makes for a very enjoyable watch.However, the big let-down here for me is that in having 'The Gentleman Highwayman' there was a real opportunity for some good dialogue but the script was definitely lacking in punchiness and there were few belly laughs. Okay, so the lines weren't terrible but to me it does highlight a problem with recent British films; ignoring a few notable exceptions the screenplays being written today are still relatively mediocre when compared to some of Hollywood's efforts.

The acting is excellent all round, and Liv Tyler's luscious Rebecca is fun and interesting in herself. One of my very few disappointments was that the last ten or fifteen minutes seemed to be rushed, giving me a slight feeling of, Huh? Is it finished? when the titles rolled. Overall, excellent.

That was a little annoying, but for some reason I wanted to see this movie so I managed to talk my friend into it and we went to see it and in the end I really enjoyed it.This movie is about a couple of highwaymen, Plunkett and Maclaine. Plunkett was once an alchemist but after is business failed and his wife died, he took up highway robbery to earn enough money to sail to America. Things were going slow until he ran into Captain Maclaine, a noble who loved to drink, wrench, and gamble - and because of this he had thrown away all of his money and was now in debtor's gaol. Maclaine doesn't want anything to do with Plunkett at first because Maclaine is a noble and Plunkett is a commoner, but reality comes home when Maclaine falls over in front of some nobles and is scorned by them. It is then that he realises that he is no longer in their midsts and is determined to claw his way back.There is also a character named Chance. He is a brutal man whose job is to enforce the law, and he does this by any means possible. At this time there is debate over whether to enact a police force or not - the argument is that a police force will take freedom away from the people - but at this time the people are so poor that they have little freedom anyway; and now the rich are being targeted by Plunkett and Maclaine and none feel safe.Yet they have earned the name of the Gentlemen Highwaymen namely because Maclaine is so nice to the ladies when he robs them. At first he robs the girl that he has fallen for and apologises as he is robbing her, but he has such a smooth mouth that he takes the title with glee and begins to play upon it inciting the imaginations of the noble and the commoners alike. The women swoon over them but the men hate them. Maclaine milks it for all its worth, because he is a man that loves fame, women, and people taking notice of him. Plunkett simply wants to get to America and plans on quitting when he has enough money. Unfortunately that is never going to happen because Maclaine is too interested in stealing Plunkett's money and wasting it. As it is said, there is no honour among thieves.Maclaine does nothing to deserve Plunkett's mercy. At first he manages to get them out of gaol, but as Maclaine becomes more obsessed with his partying, the original goal vanishes. Anyway, Maclaine has no intention of going to America - all of the fun is in England. The women, his legend, and the parties. Plunkett wants a new life while Maclaine simply wants to continue living the life he has. He can't afford it, but that does not matter because he will simply steal more.One final character that I must discuss is Rochester - he is a very quirky character. It is implied, but never stated, that he is bi-sexual. The quote is do you still swing both ways?; No, I swing all ways! There are numerous suggestions to homosexuality but it is never stated - this is left for our imagination. What we are given though is a class of debaucherers. The nobles live a life far above their means and enjoy it at other people's expense. We see a society here where the poor live in the mud - and this is not hidden as we see Maclaine go from the very poor to the very rich, but even so there is still a dirty feel to the movie - as if the nobles, even though they live is luxury, are still incredibly dirty on the inside.The interesting thing about this movie is that it is set in the 18th century, but the soundtrack is very modern - almost 90's. I can't offer any real explanation except that it worked very well. I really liked this movie, and is one of the best I have seen so far.

Some of the dialog transcends pleasing to brilliant, the plot is interesting, the characters - while SLIGHTLY anacronistic - are anacronistic not due to their intrinsic nature (there WERE flamboyantly gay people in the 18th century, contrary to a previous reviewer's remarks) but just in a bit of the language they used.  The anachronisms made it fun, though, and NOT cheesy and easily dismissed.If you've ever read any Simon R. Green, or Gleen Cook's Garrett series, you know EXACTLY what this movie is.  Check it out.

Liv Tyler plays her role as the rebellious stuck up love interest to perfection and her British accent is 100% accurate.  She is so beautiful and so talented, I've never imagined her in a role like this, but she always ceases to amaze me. Alan Cumming probably steals the show as an over the top bisexual, and you will laugh at his clever and witty one-liners. Plunkett and MaCleane is a highly enjoyable British romp with gorgeous actors and costumes.  As soon as you walk out of the theatre you will just want to get right back in there and see it again.

The tone is lighthearted, with a touch of social commentary, but nothing too heavy. One could almost see Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone in this.It starts out in low gear, with the introduction of the characters and the establishing of the themes of social inequality and rebellion; but, it kicks into high gear once the boys hit the highways. The robberies are grand and stylish, with romantic touches that are the bread and butter of swashbucklers. The actors are engaging and help elevate the material a bit, which is fairly hollow. There's not much depth to the figures, but they are played with such charm and skill that it doesn't matter.Muh has been said about the modern music. Period music tended to the more serene, which seems out of place. A classical score with Celtic rhythms for the action pieces could work, but the more modern, rebellious rock and techno music seemed to add an edge to the action. Since the characters are more legend than reality, accuracy in the music seems pointless. The pieces tend to fit the mood of the aired scenes, so it mostly works well. I just wonder how they missed Adam Ant's Stand and Deliver. Make no mistake, this is not a serious film. It's pure escapism and a wonderful lark. Tony Scott shows some of the visual flair of his father, but I don't think we are going to see many Oscar nods in his career just yet. He seems to understand the material here and pulls off a fine film. With time he may prove to be a name to reckon with. His father took a while to mature beyond visual stylization and become a more rounded director. This is definitely one to watch for an entertaining evening or for a swashbuckling film fest.

The trailer opened with typical period drama pretentiousness before turning into a punkish, rebellious wild ride. When I went to see it at the cinema (during its extremely limited theatrical run) I hadn't even planned on it that day. I just turned up in time and decided to take a chance. A wise choice indeed, as I was in a bad mood that day and this movie really cheered me up.It's London, it's 1748, Robert Carlisle and Johnny Lee Miller play the titular highwaymen from opposite ends of the social spectrum. Will Plunkett brings the highway know-how while Captain James Macleane makes the connections to high society. Lord Gibson takes personal offence to their antics after being robbed, but her Niece Lady Rebecca (the lovely Liv Tyler) falls in love with Macleane, and his unusual gentlemanly ways. Ken Stott plays the truly vile Chance, the police inspector determined to see the men hang at any cost, and one of the nastiest villains in recent film history.Jake Scott (son of Ridley, nephew of Tony) directs with a style that fuses Gothic tones with post-modernism. This is no Pride and Prejudice. Plunkett & Macleane is glam rock on acid while retaining all of the usual gritty, earthy production designs of previous Ridley/Tony films. Amazingly, Jake Scott would not direct another film until 11 years after this got released.There is a strange rumor persistent on the Internet that Plunkett & Macleane (inspired by true story, don't you know) began life as a completely different film. I recall seeing production stills in magazines in 1996 (three years before its release), and there have been suggestions that it was originally called 'The Lady Highwayman' with Liv Tyler as the lead and Carlisle and Miller merely as supporting characters. The original screenplay by Selwyn Roberts apparently featured bizarre mathematical subtext before being heavily re-written by Bond-scribes Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. I'm not sure if any of the original material made it into the final, 99-minute, cut of the film.A score by Trevor Jones was also apparently rejected in favor of Craig Armstrong. While I have no idea what Jones may or may not have recorded for this film, there is no doubt that Armstrong's work is utterly amazing, probably his career best.Plunkett & Macleane seems to have fallen into obscurity since its release. Don't let it pass you by though, it's loads of fun and deserved a wider audience.

"},{"Title":"Wonderful!","Date":"30 March 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Crime","Review":" When this film was released in 1999 I remember thinking that I wouldn't mind seeing it. I never got around to it at the time and I'd forgotten about it until I saw that it was available on Netflix a couple of days ago. My wife was away so I gave it a go, thinking it was a bit of a lads' shoot 'em up adventure, which on one level it is, but it's so much more than that and it's gone straight into my all-time top 5 films. I enjoyed it so much that I watched it again the next day when my wife had returned as I thought she'd also love it, which she did (though not quite as much as me). I've never watched a film twice in two days before but I could watch it again right now as there are details that I missed each time (e.g. Armstrong & Miller's characters, Winterburn and Dixon, being named after two of Arsenal's defenders in the 1980s/90s). The attention to detail in the film added so much for me, such as in the scene where Gibson (Michael Gambon) has a chat with Mr Chance (Ken Stott) in a circular, domed room. The dialogue is wonderful, with Gibson witheringly cutting Chance down to size by reminding him of his rise to power from a lowly start in life - What's it feel like to look down on your humble origins from the dizzy heights? Does it make you giddy? The location, music, lighting and camera angles make the scene highly atmospheric but what struck me in particular was the sight of the three dogs that ran through the room and then back again during the conversation. There was no apparent reason for them to be in the scene but it was a lovely addition to it. The big set pieces, such as the ball and the wedding party, again beautifully shot and lit, were sumptuous visual extravaganzas that also contained wonderful witty dialogue. The use of the contemporary techno music during the Baroque dance scene worked fabulously well, as did the stylised dancing itself. Craig Armstrong's score in general was superb and the Tiger Lillies' falsetto-voiced music hall songs suited the era perfectly. The film is also a celebration of British acting talent, with character actors, both dramatic and comic, from the main leads to the briefest, blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo role, reveling in the opportunity to camp it up and mug the camera. Robert Carlyle and Johnny Lee Miller play off each other to hilarious and touching effect in the title roles. Liv Tyler plays the sparky love interest nicely and, unlike some reviewers, I didn't have any problem with her British accent. Michael Gambon is peerless as always - that man could make a Tesco shopping list seem profound - and Ken Stott creates one of cinema's most memorable villains. Of the lesser roles, Terence Rigby's humane gaoler is a lovely touch and Claire Rushbrook is great as the pox- ridden Lady Estelle. The comedy pairings of Armstrong & Miller and Lucas & Walliams (in a precursor of his 'I'm a lady' Little Britain shtick) bring short but welcome bursts of pantomime to the proceedings. Have I forgotten anyone? Ah yes, Alan Cumming. Rochester is the role of a lifetime for him and, as many other reviewers have pointed out, he steals the film from the moment he appears in his purple hat. All of the other actors are also excellent but a special mention must go to Nichola McAuliffe as Lady Crombie. I'm amazed that no-one else has mentioned her as what she delivers in the three or four lines that she's given is pure perfection - When a brave new gentleman comes upon the scene&#x85;we ladies are quite aflutter. She hardly moves a facial muscle and her voice is almost a monotone but the effect is extraordinary. Her brief appearance really jumped out at me and I had to replay her scene a few times just to wallow in her skill. So, all in all, a fun, dark, atmospheric, anachronistic historical romp in which the bad guys get their comeuppance and the 'good' guys live to fight another day. Terrific and highly recommended.

And it reunites Trainspotting stars Johnny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle in the title roles, plus adds Liv Tyler as a bit of 'love interest.' It's one of those rare films which mixes action, adventure and adult humour extremely well and pulls everything off. There's very little not to like about the film. However, every time I read something negative about it, it's someone always slagging off the music. Yes, the film uses highly modern dance music for a film set hundreds of years ago. Some people seem to find that very difficult to take. Personally, I thought it worked a treat.Whether you like action or black humour, you have to watch this film.

The characters are based on two genuine highwaymen of the eighteenth century.Plunkett And Macleane was filmed at the height of the early popularity of Carlyle he'd made an impression as Begbie in Trainspotting and followed that with the hit movie The Full Monty. Lee Miller hadn't followed up his role as Sick Boy in Trainspotting with such roles, but for some reason he was still popular. So re teaming probably seemed like a good idea. Sadly some parts of Plunkett And Macleane are so ludicrous I wondered whether it was originally conceived as a spoof comedy, much like the Carry On movie Don't Lose Your Head staring Sid James. Alan Cummings certainly seems like he stepped straight out of that movie. Of the two lead actors Carlyle is by far the best actor of the two, and his roguish character Plunkett is the more likable of the two. He gets the best lines and scenes (including a duel) As for Lee Miller's Macleane I'm not sure his character is meant to be as funny as he seems. What makes it more amazing is the dapper dan thief, who fancied himself as a gentleman is based on a real life person. Liv Tyler turns up as a love interest for Lee Miller and to put it bluntly she is a waste of a corset! She is dull bland and lifeless. There are worse ways to spend 90 minutes, but I doubt I'll ever feel the need to revisit this.

Liv Tyler is an asset to any movie but, through no fault of hers, her character was equally unconvincing. Robert Carlyle was much better as Plunkett, but Robert Stott's performance is the best thing in the movie.Possible spoilers 1)The Robert Stott character really would not have fought a dual with a lower-class person like Plunkett. 2)Why would the movie-makers imagine that wanted criminals could easily escape to the British-controlled American colonies and be safe there?

And there is little or no real character development.  But for Jake (son of Ridley) Scott's first attempt, it's well worth the ticket price.Captain James MaCleane (Jonny Lee Miller looking as good as ever) may be a gentleman, but he hasn't got the money or the clothes to prove it. Plunkett (Robert Carlyle with all his clothes on) is an apothecary-turned-outlaw. The circumstances of their strange meeting involve a dead body, a ruby, and eventually a partnership as the Gentlemen Highwaymen.  As the tag line says, they rob the rich... and that's it.  There isn't really much background, or even in-depth development, but the object seems to be to relieve the aristocracy of enough money and jewels to pay for the two Highwaymen's passage to America.  One small problem MaCleane falls in love.  With the Chief Justice's ward, Rebecca (Liv Tyler).  Who happens to also have caught the eye of the Thief Taker General.The plot is original enough, the casting is excellent (especially Alan Cumming as the drag-queenish Lord Rochester, Carlyle and Miller--also together in Trainspotting, they haven't lost their dynamic), the costuming is fantastic, the makeup is outrageous, and the music is hard-edged techno with a strangely classical undertone.  Jake Scott has an eye for light and shadow, a good sense of balance between spectacle and plot, and he isn't squeamish about showing the more unpleasant side of 17th century London. And lucky for us, he likes close-ups of faces, especially eyes.  Jonny Lee Miller's eyes.  And Liv Tyler's, too, but hey, who is this movie about? Rebecca?  No.  Plunkett and MaCleane.  But there's more to this movie than just pretty faces.  At the risk of sounding cliche, it's a fast, furious, and sometimes frustrating ride with the most noble highwaymen since Robin Hood.

Perhaps it is the whole period/costume drama, because their plots are entirely different.Plunkett and Macleane is about two men named Plunkett and Macleane. Plunkett is the all wise rugged thief who is played by Robert Carlyle and Macleane is a gentleman, a captain to be exact, who has gambled his good name away. He is played by Johnny Lee Miller.******SPOILERS********** The story has the two heroes meeting while a burglary goes wrong for Plunkett and his former partner. They are robbing a coach and crash into the prison Macleane is being held in. Plunkett and his partner are being chased by the evil and ugly Chance, who has a superiority complex and a thing for gouging out eyeballs.His partner is injured seriously and swallows a ruby that comes in handy for both parties. Chance kills the poor robber and is on a quest to capture Plunkett. Macleane is of course a silent witness to all of this, and along with a sudden entrance to freedom he now knows a ruby is lodged in the insides of a man and will go to the cemetery to find it.Plunkett has the same idea and the two men meet again.They are caught and are imprisoned for robbing from the grave, the stolen ruby turns out to be their saving grace. The two men strike a deal and a friendship as bandits. With Macleanes access to high society and Plunketts mischievous demeanor they form a perfect team of flamboyant gentlemen highwaymen. They encounter rich and rob as one nobleman puts it with style. The two seem to be on a great path heading for the Americas with their acquired riches, until Macleane falls in love with the lovely Lady Rebecca Gibson(Liv Tyler).This movie works because of the humor and acting. British movies in particular seem to have a seriousness to them that can be depressing. This movie is both funny and depressing, this is not a pretty time to be in England ( though Liv Tyler's Rebecca Gibson surely thinks so). It has wonderful quirky characters such as Rochester( Alan Cumming).I loved all the characters and some particularly favorite scenes which I enjoyed. 1. Rochester is just great as the 18th century flamboyant bisexual. He of course swings every way though his preference is clearly male and all scenes involving Lord Rochester are great, since he parades around like a queen he so wishes he could be.2. The sex scene between Macleane and the richest woman in England Estell is just funny. Here Macleane is trying to be all romantic and charming to a woman old enough to be his mother. Estell annoyed at his pretty words simply says oh shut up and f*** me! Hilarious!3. The robbery at Estells engagement party where the stylish Macleane (masked of course) not only robs the guests, but treats them to some entertainment. He disgustingly reveals to her guests that this woman is infected with the pox! (something Macleane caught by his poetic hook up). Being a Lady, Estell is embarrassed and destroyed as fireworks ablaze and Macleane succeeds in shaming her.4. The ball scene. Great music. It is worth just looking at. Liv Tyler looks absolutely beautiful with a Marie Antoinette style hair and haughty attitude. Great.5. Macleanes ongoing anguish over his love for Rebecca is quite endearing. Plunkett is positively annoyed, but Macleane is truly distraught. Even while pleasuring prostitutes he is in a complex about the lady Rebecca and when he is infected with the pox (thanks to Estell) he is disgusted and tells Plunkett How am I to make love to Rebecca?. 6. The hanging scene. Again another scene where the music plays a role. Macleane is caught and is to be put to death by hanging. It is a sad scene watching both Rochester and Rebeccas broken faces while Chance is grinning like an idiot and forcing Rebecca to watch her beloved die....but than in grand fashion Plunkett arrives to save the day!!!!!!!!!!7. The friendship between the two men is really my favorite as friendship seems to lack so much with movies and if two characters of the same sex are good friends they are immediately labeled homosexuals. I do not think this is a borderline homosexual friendship. It is one that came out of convenience, but turned genuine. As is stated above one is a rugged thief the other a gentlemen. When Macleane is caught and is being tried he shouts in his final words to a room full of nobility that the only thing he is sorry for is the hurt he caused his friend Plunkett. He continues to state that while Plunkett is not of noble blood he is more of a gentlemen than any man in the room. A nice touch in my opinion.This movie is one of the better period films in that it has some pretty funny scenes and it has a modern twist. A movie that if disgustingly great.

It is, however, eminently watchable. It's a fantastic spectacle that doesn't take itself too seriously, and so, whilst it might not be up there with the all time greats I would never be annoyed to walk into a room and find it showing...

Just to prove he doesn't need to copy his dad entirely - I must say that unfortunately the film reeks of Ridley Scott'ish type touches -though that's in no way detracting from it - it's simply a bit odd.Musically you can't flaw it and swearing is ten a penny in any modern film, not everybody spoke perfect English until the 1970's and Punk you know. There are some complaints at the 'anachronistic' ballroom music (Track 7 on the Soundtrack - simply called Ball) but the fact is it's in the background and hardly important.  The main crux of the entire tune is the simple violin arrangement with a bit of drum and bass behind it and they're talking over pretty much 99% of what you hear anyhow.  What it does succeed in doing is highlighting the fact that society in the 1700's was no less debauched or less crude than the 1990's or at any other time in history. You can basically just imagine the film in one of two ways - as a period piece incorporating the present, or a modern film in period dress.Surprisingly - the soundtrack is still used to this day in innumerable commercials on TV (it was actually being played in the background at todays 6 Nations match between England + France).  So if it's so bloody horrendous, then it's a minority who think so.It's ropey, it's naff and the dialogue is pants.  But it's funny if you watch it as it is and stop being pretentious overbearing snobs for a few moments to let its rather coarse working class humour work its way into you.The acting is nothing special, but I didn't pay to watch Olivier, and dodgy acting has never held back some of the better names (and films) of the last 50 years.Oh and they're all insufferably richer than us, so I doubt they much care.It's fun, worth renting if only to prove one side or the other right/wrong.

I expected it to be the period adventure-comedy advertised on the video; however, the film turned out to be much darker and much more interesting than I expected.  It's basically the story of two losers who team up out of mutual need.  Macleane is the poor, vain aristocrat who finds the loot and Plunkett is the criminal who masterminds the thieving.  The film is very dark, offering a surprisingly realistic view of 18th century England, filled with bloody eye-gouging, lewd brothels and excrement raining down from windows onto the streets.  The characters of Plunkett and Macleane progress from the motives of greed and vainity to becoming true partners and friends.  Plunkett learns to trust and reveal his past, while Macleane learns to value friendship and love over wealth etc. (Sounds a bit corny, but it's not that bad) The supporting characters vary.  Liv Tyler, as the love interest Rebecca, and the villan Mr. Chance are both underdevloped; although, Mr. Chance has some interestingly violent tendencies for such a small man, including the ability to gouge out a man's eye with his bare hands. Alan Cummings is entertaining as always as Macleane's foppish friend Rodchester.  He manages to bring emotion to the seemingly silly character.  A previous comment said they were disappointed with the film's ending.  Without giving it away, I have to say that I enjoyed it.  It was very suspenseful and dark.

Liv Tyler is great as Lady Rebecca, but her part takes a back-seat.  My favorite character (and actor) was Lord Rochester, played by Alan Cumming.

It's been my observation that supremely hyped, music video movies tend to be all surface and very little depth. Because the director of Plunkett & Macleane (Jake Scott) is the son of Ridley Scott, I expected even more surface than usual (the movie visually reminds me of a 1980 Ridley Scott film, Legend, in its cluttered, almost shimmering food and jewels). The movie didn't prove me wrong. Its surface is beautifully crafted and eye-catching (mud-caked coats, dust coated food, foppish lords and ladies, decadence around every corner), but there's very little depth.To be fair to the movie, there -are- small, almost throw-away moments of characterization Plunkett gazing at his map of America and later telling Macleane that he's never loved anyone, Macleane admiring his new, dashing figure as a highwayman in the mirror, Rochester's eyes closing as Macleane is sentenced to hang. But these small touches remain mostly superficial as well. They work because they are archetypes. The viewers expect Plunkett to have a painful past (no decent highwayman mentor would be without one) and Macleane to suddenly feel proud of being a highwayman (it's supposed to be a buddy/surrogate son movie, right?). Still, if you don't ask much from the movie, these small moments do work, in their simple formula.I think it is to Robert Carlyle's and Ken Stott's credit that despite the lack of depth given to their characters (Plunkett and Mr. chance, respectively) they can still manage to pull a somewhat haunted past behind their character's eyes. Too bad the movie never devotes the time to bringing these (mostly) implied pasts to the forefront. As it is, Plunkett & Macleane is the promise of a much better movie that never unfolds.

Tagline for the film says 'They rob the rich...and that's it', which pretty much sums up the film - and its gung-ho, tongue-in-cheek attitude.Anyway, Robert Carlyle is Plunkett - a poor thief, who has now developed into something of an expert highwayman. Jonny Lee Miller is Macleane - an upper-class socialite who has now been castigated from the elite. Their paths cross one night when they end up in prison for grave digging, resulting in a new found partnership-in-crime. With the use of Plunkett's criminal know how, and Macleane's links with the rich and famous, a profitable future can be made in robbing the rich and having a good laugh while doing so. Plunkett's poor background means the money is going towards a ticket and a way out to America, while Macleane sees it as one long adventure.Along the way, a little romance is added to the melting pot when Macleane falls in love with Lady Rebecca (Liv Tyler) whose family is under threat from tough law enforcer Ken Stott, a kind of thief-finder general who is also hunting the illustrious P&M. Flashy and stylish it may be, the film doesn't grab much attention, even with dazzling shots of people running through blazing fireworks while shooting off flintlocks. Not being able to generate any excitement from the hold-ups, the film constantly resorts to using crass jokes about certain parts of the body and how they are affected by disease. On the up-side, performances are good - including Tyler, but it's Alan Cumming who gets all the best lines as a gay aristocrat, camping it up big time.

The opening section is very dark and sets the scene well, but drags on too much. The middle part is perhaps the best, with some great set piece scenes - an extravagant ballroom dancing scene played out like a Friday nightclub, the raid on the dinner party. Then the final part falls into the usual hackneyed formulaic conclusion.It's a pity because there are a lot of things I do like about the film. The use of music (by Craig Armstrong, strings arranger to the stars) is extremely good and the support lent by Alan Cumming and Alan Stott as, respectively an over-the-top dandy and a dour thief-taker rounds out the film a bit more.Unfortunately, Liv Tyler, as the love interest (who actually gets to wield some guns), has a pretty underwritten part. The locations are suitably dirty but I can't help feeling I've seen it before. And despite their best efforts Carlyle and Miller never quite lift the script above the mildly engrossing level.Basically, for a film which advertises itself as being about action and characters, it doesn't have enough of either. All it has is the promise of a better movie, and a catchy tagline They rob the rich - and that's it. Director Jake Scott will probably do a lot better in the future.Plunkett & Macleane is ultimately a film that, despite trying its hardest, fails to deliver the goods. And that's it.

It would appear that some bright spark thought it would be a great idea to create a period caper movie in a modern style and then developed a story to fit. Unfortunately it would appear that this bright spark thought the originality of the initial concept was enough to carry the movie...it wasn't. The basic synopsis of the film is fairly promising - a common criminal teams up with a more gentlemanly rogue to form a highway robbery partnership in 18th Century England. The reasoning for this collaboration is that the gentleman, Maclean (Jonny Lee Miller), can use his more aristicratic demeanor to target rich victims and the more experienced thief Plunkett (Robert Carlyle) can lead the robberies. Of course, at the start of the film, Plunkett is the more hardened criminal with little morality and little care for anyone but himself, whilst Maclean is the aristocrat who more than likes a drink and a healthier diet of gambling and women. That is pretty much were the characterisation begins and ends for the leads and despite the inevitable shift in their attitudes during the film they both remain fairly one-dimensional.  Carlyle and Miller perform about as well as can be expected with the script they have been given and at times lift the film above its shortcomings. The supporting cast also outperform the script, particularly Alan Cumming as the foppish Rochester, who despite being a bit of a stereotype provides some well-needed entertainment. Liv Tyler does not have a massive amount to do in the film, but what she does do is passable, if a little lazy. The bad guy, Mr Chance, is played by Ken Stott and although his acting is fine, I never really took him that seriously...he seemed to have something missing.This film manages to waste almost all of the potential of the basic storyline and fails to develop the characters in an interesting way. Plunkett and Maclean begin by disliking each other and only team up for mutual benefit. Inevitably however, the begin to warm to each other, but the viewer is not really given a solid reason why this is the case. The dialogue is extremely limited and the effing and blinding that appears rife in British films post 'Lock Stock...' is present. As for the production design, its an admirable attempt to bring a period film into the 21st Century and at least it is not another tired period drama. The costume and set design works quite well, if a little artificial and although it is hardly realistic to 18th Century London, its certainly refreshing. On the other hand, the musical style does not appear to work - somehow the MTV score appears disjointed against the action and will probably date extremely quickly.In summary, this is not an appalling film. It lacks depth, but there is enough action to prevent you nodding off, and its sufficiently different to warrant a viewing when you have little else to do. If you do not expect too much you will not be disappointed.

It was neither. The plot was dull, the performances were uninspired and flat and even Robert Carlyle couldn't save the script.Basically the film is about two highwaymen, who steal stuff and try not to get caught. I'd like to be able to say there was more to it but there wasn't. There is the obligatory love interest (Liv Tyler) but her part seems to have been crow-barred in at the last minute with no consideration as to where or how it integrates into the film as a whole.The 1000 word limit on reviews prevents me from listing the grotesque historical inaccuracies of the film but I will mention that it revived the old Hollywood beliefs that flint-locks and muskets were accurate at any distance, had automatic mechanisms and reloaded in seconds not minutes. This was certainly not the only daft idea in the film but it was one of the most annoying.In it's favour I would say that the sets were well made, if often inappropriate, and that the production quality was above average.This however did not change the fact that the film as a whole was dire, as demonstrated by the outbreaks of laughter in the theatre during some of the supposedly serious scenes.In short my advice to anyone who is thinking about seeing this film is don't, go and see Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

It stars Robert Carlyle Plunkett, Jonny Lee Miller Macleane, Liv Tyler, Ken Stott, Michael Gambon & Alan Cumming. The thinly written story concerns our two Highwaymen protagonists who although at different ends of the social spectrum, team up to rob the rich, and that's it! It's a odd film in many ways, with Scott and his team trying to keep an old fashioned value whilst giving it a modern day MTV make over. The result of which is a choppy picture that none the less is just about fun enough for the undemanding viewer.The piece had a number of producers involved in it, one of whom was Gary Oldman, so it's probably no surprise that it feels that it's been cut, re-shot and tampered with. There's no discernible flow to the movie, in fact it actually could be classed as one long MTV video. Crash follows wallop as techno modern beats blend uneasily with dandy dalliances. It's testament to Carlyle & Miller that they manage to rise above it and generate a believable bond that holds court and stops the viewers from pondering about the weak excuse of a plot on offer. There's also enough good to be had in the comedy moments and one or two of the set-pieces. Notably in the smoke bombed finale. In support, Ken Stott, a fine television actor, does a nice line in malicious, weasel villainy, and Alan Cumming is a pure delight as the camp swinger of all ways, Lord Rochester. Gambon isn't given much to do, while Tyler is effectively asked to look pretty and fill out her period costume to the max.It's full of spirit and it has some nice technical touches, but it remains an awkward film that is quickly forgotten once the ringing in your ears has stopped. 5/10 "}{"Title":"Could have been better...","Date":"31 January 2005","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Crime","Review":" The big-screen debut of director Scott, whose only other directorial credit is the short-lived television series The Hunger, is the son of the sometimes-brilliant Ridley Scott. Reuniting Carlyle (who charmed the world in *The Full Monty*) and Miller, who appeared together in *Trainspotting*, it is a somewhat disjointed affair that can be a pleasure to watch, nonetheless. With spectacular art direction, and some dazzling effects, the camera-work can be dizzying as well as captivating. Scott interjects certain modern elements of music and cinematic that can have a jarring effect in this period piece. Aside from a deplorable title (the name sounds too much like *Tango and Cash* or *Turner and Hooch*), this tale of an ill-matched pair of highwaymen, as lush and romantic as it is, leaves something to be desired. With elements of *Robin Hood*, *Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid*, as well as *Batman*, it is an ambitious undertaking.The leads seem to do their best, and are engaging as the rogues, but the story rapidly becomes preposterous and you often find yourself wondering if you missed something. Then there's Liv Tyler. What can we say about Liv? That she's very good for her age? That someday she may be a fine actress? The truth of the matter is, that except for her lineage (such as it is), she is only one of the flood of lovely and somewhat inept starlets that have had a brief moment of attention lately. Always a pleasure to look at, she would do well to introduce a new facial expression (or two) into her repertoire. Alan Cumming, who won the Tony for his portrayal of the emcee in *Cabaret*, is flamboyantly superb as Lord Rochester, Claire Rushbrook has a gem of a role as the wealthy and syphilitic Lady Estelle, and Ken Stott is despicable as the sadistic chief of police. Shot in Prague, Spain and London, the locations serve the film perfectly, but the pop-synth music is at odds with the period, and even though it occasionally adds excitement, overall, it's distracting. Not a bad debut, overall, and a hint of the surprises Scott has in store for us.

Sent to jail, the two buy their freedom and set about getting enough money to go to the then-colony of North America, with Macleane (the former) as the Gentleman Highwayman (Men and women tremble when they see me, but for very different reasons!) and Plunkett (the latter) working beside him.This being the movies, there are complications - some nice, like Macleane falling in love with the Chief Justice's daughter; some not so nice, like Plunkett making a mortal enemy of the Thief Taker General. But what reads like an exhiliarating movie plays as something less; the movie isn't as deliberately anachronistic as A Knight's Tale or your average Desperate Dan comic strip, but with characters calling each other geezer and wanker, action scenes filmed like music videos, and a Craig Armstrong score that suffers from Ladyhawke Syndrome (the tendency to set scenes set in the distant past to unashamedly modern music), you know you're not dealing with Kenneth Clark here.Not that I would have minded if there had been a stronger story; director Jake Scott (and yes, he is related to Tony and Ridley) and writers Robert Wade, Neal Purvis and Charles McKeown come up with some bright spots, but they never really go for broke - the film could have been a complete blast but doesn't really manage it, and as a result a few too many scenes which could have worked don't (like the attack on the French Ambassador, who even after being shot takes time out to finish his drink before dying). And in spite of Miller and Carlyle's best efforts, they're both upstaged by Alan Cumming as the last word in camp (I swing EVERY way). But then, anyone who didn't see that coming was lying.It's still watchable, but never as much fun as it could have been. And though I can (and often do) watch anything with Liv Tyler in it, a note to the casting directors of British movies if you're going to cast well-known American actresses for them, bringing them over to play the lead or a major ensemble role makes sense. Bringing them over to play The Girl doesn't (as the Chief Justice's daughter, La Tyler is so underused that PolyGram may as well have cast Natalie Casey from Two Pints Of Lager And A Packet Of Crisps for all the difference it makes). Only ITV has been known to waste US imports more thoroughly.

Scott Jnr has a footing in musical videos and his use of very quick editing gave me the impression I was watching a film by Michael Bay . Very soon I was expecting something to turn in to a giant robot or some American pretty boy scream  Get me in to a god damn stagecoach  . I don't know if it's because I watched this movie on television but half the time when an action sequence happened the elliptical editing meant it was difficult to make out what was happening , but before long I stopped caring what was happening on screen When this was released in 1999 Robert Carlyle was just about the coolest actor in Britain as well as one of the most prolific . The problem was at this stage he was concentrating on quantity rather quality and his performance as a southern geezer is rather dreadful with his mockney accent which is even more annoying than David Tennant's one in DOCTOR WHO . Note to directors - stop hiring Scottish actors playing Londoners . Oh and if you're hiring directors to make historical action adventures make sure you get the right one with a surname of Scott "},{"Title":"Really really really bad","Date":"10 October 1999","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Crime","Review":"  I gave this movie a 1, because I couldn't give it a 0.

This is a genuinely awful film, with nothing good going for it whatsoever. Directed by the son of Ridley Scott, it is a lifeless, inept, insulting, patronising, implausible, pointless, witless disaster.  With a truly horrible soundtrack. About which more later.  First though, we must address just why this film is a failure on every level.  Johnny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle (talented performers, I'm sure you'll agree) are Plunkett and Macleane (though not necessarily in that order).  One of them is a gentlemen and the other is a low-life scumbag.  They join forces to rob people and live it up.  Great. Except, it's not.  It's just dull.  Their relationship is implausible and uninteresting.  You simply could not care less what happens to them; you know, for instance,  that Carlyle will end up saving Miller at some point, because he spends the whole film hating him.  The dead predictability of the entire enterprise is depressing in the extreme.  Liv Tyler turns up, fancies Miller, and gets embroiled in some ridiculous plot.  Various British actors wander through, half-asleep, faxing in their performances and collecting their cheques.  Dialogue that is, I think, intended to be witty, falls like bricks from the actors' mouths.  This is no Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.  In place of snappy one-liners, we get such aphorisms as, W*nker and F**k off.  Alan Cumming plays the oh-so-hilarious bisexual fop, and looks so ashamed to be wasting his talent in this tripe that it makes your heart bleed for him. The production design and lighting contrive to make outdoor scenes look like film sets, and indoor scenes look like film studios. Which I'm pretty certain was not the intention.  The entire film looks more like a making-of documentary than the finished product.  Extras mill about like extras.  Fake sets resolutely fail to convince you of anything other than their fakeness.  Performers flounder around, desperately wondering how they got involved in this, and how quickly they can get out again. And, finally, the soundtrack.  Veering from tepid chill-out techno horror to full-on awful songs, the soundtrack is guaranteed to set your teeth on edge.  Words cannot describe the dreadfulness of one song in particular that is played at least twice, and seems to feature a vocal performance from a fox in its death throes, accompanied by a backing band made up of four-year-old cretins banging pots and pans together, and trying to pretend they haven't got learning difficulties. How films like this can get made is a mystery.  How talented people can get involved in them is a mystery.  Why films like this flop resoundingly at the box office is, however, no mystery at all.

My problem is that they've dumbed down this tale for the modern audience. Highwaymen are already sexy, exciting characters. They don;t need the techno soundtrack and snappy dialogue. "}]
