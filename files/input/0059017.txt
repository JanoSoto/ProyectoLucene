[{"Title":"Great western spoof, and Lee Marvin steals the film!","Date":"15 January 2005","Score":"55 out of 58 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Western","Review":" Cat Ballou is a movie spoof unlike any other, and a great parody of the Western film genre. Jane Fonda appears in one of her most playful film roles (Barbarella is another light and funny Fonda classic), and Lee Marvin gives one of his finest film performances (he won his Oscar for his dual roles). Add to this mix a wondrous soundtrack, with Nat King Cole and Stubby Kaye as minstrels of sorts who stroll and sing throughout, making the film almost seem like a musical; an outstanding supporting cast including Michael Callan (who later appeared on TV's One Life to Live), and Dwayne Hickman (TV's Dobie Gillis), and the result is this hilarious, thoroughly entertaining film that was nominated for five Academy Awards (Marvin was the sole winner). Catherine Ballou (Fonda)is a recently graduated-from-school schoolteacher returning home to live with her father on his ranch, but he is gunned down upon her arrival. She enlists the help of a loyal ranch-hand, a couple of outlaws, and most notably, a has-been gunman by the name of Kid Sheleen (Marvin) to help her get revenge. The result is a thoroughly enjoyable film that still stands up today, and Lee Marvin stealing the entire film in his amazing dual role performance as both Tim Strong and Kid Sheleen. Lee Marvin alone makes the film well worth seeing.The dialogue is great. Take this exchange as an exampleJackson Two-Bears Kid, Kid, what a time to fall off the wagon. Look at your eyes. Kid Sheleen What's wrong with my eyes? Jackson Two-Bears Well they're red; bloodshot. Kid Sheleen You ought to see 'em from my side.I was thrilled when the widescreen special edition of this long-time favorite of mine came out in 2003, and on DVD. I have the soundtrack on vinyl, but I have always wished that it would come out on CD; Nat King Cole is one of my all-time favorite singers, and his rendition of They'll Never Make Me Cry always makes me...anyway. This film still hasn't lost any of its humor or fun with the passing of time, and stays on of my personal top ten list of comedy.

A spoof western, definitely. That Lee Marvin should not have won the Oscar? No way. It is far more difficult to carry off a role in what is obviously a pastiche than to excel in a serious dramatic part. Lee Marvin plays it to perfection. Watch his face in the bar scene in the hole in the wall, desperately trying to catch the moment to propose a toast - I'll drink to that!. It's brilliant. This film has to be watched in the context of its time. It is no good trying to compare it to today's special effects dominated blockbusters or Pixar animations. The semi-musical format was innovative, and remains so today. Cat Ballou is a perfect example of 60's cool.

Her outlawing is beautifully justified as the evil town members plot to take over her father's spread and finally have him killed.  All are in on the plot/take, including the sheriff, a ne'er do well planted in the job.  There are many similarities to 'Silverado', an equally well acted ensemble tour de force. Whoever did Lee Marvin's drunken riding, mostly out of the saddle, close to the ground, did a superior riding job. And if it was Lee himself, more credit to him.  He got the Oscar and justifiably so.  Under the comedy was the message concerning the sheep-like behavior of 'respectable, middle-class people', the wicked townfolk, bankrolled by the Wolf Company (love these names).  Katherine Ballou, the respectable lovely schoolmistress, goes bad as the 'nice' people show themselves to be worse than the outlaws.  Hole-in-the-Wall outlaws are allowed to live there undisturbed because the scion of the Wolfe company (who is responsible for having Jane's father shot and whom Jane shoots) lets them alone.  They existed safely 'under the radar', but they want to put Jane et al out, because her gang's actions make them visible.  Reminds me of many Massachusetts politicians, as well as Whitey Bulger.  The 'Indian's' comments are hilarious, expecially about Custer, spoken as he is surrounded by neatly dressed town thugs. It's an up-to-date funny tale with a social morale.  You get the lesson without the moralizing.  I loved it, and so glad I bought it.

Jane Fonda is great as the schoolmarm-turned-outlaw Cat Ballou.  When she begins to seek vengeance against the railroad for her father's death, you believe she's really going to get them.I don't have to say much about Lee Marvin's performance; it's perfect all the way.  His dual role, where he plays Kid Shelleen and his evil brother, Tim Strawn, gives him the chance to really stretch his acting talents.  When Marvin plays the drunken Shelleen, he's a comic delight.  Even his horse looks drunk.  When he plays Strawn, the screen sizzles. If you need a reason to see this movie, Lee Marvin should be the reason.Michael Callan is fine as Jane Fonda's love interest, and Dwayne Hickman steals the scenes he's in as Callan's uncle; he's really good in this film.  John Marley is pretty funny, also, and Cat's father; his views on the Indian nation are revolutionary, to say the least.  Tom Nardini is wonderful as the hired hand who goes along on Cat's quest, none too willingly.All in all, this is a tour-de-force of acting and writing.  Sharp, witty, warm and action-packed, this is a film everyone should see at least once. I've seen it many times, and it's never lost its luster for me.

While it presents a definite Apple Dumpling Gang atmosphere, it still retains its gritty and resolute (...they'll never make her cry...) feeling. One of the best American Western comedies.Fonda is compelling as Catherine Cat Ballou, the schoolmarm-gone-bad. Her performance in this movie is among the best performances of her career.Lee Marvin's acting abilities really reach out and grab you with his dual role as Kid Shelleen and brother-gone-horribly-wrong Tim Strawn. As Shelleen, you get to experience his comedic genius (this movie has a classic comedy scene that most of us never forget, featuring Marvin as Shelleen sitting on his horse, and he AND the horse are leaning drunkenly against a building), and as Tim Strawn, the tension POPS out at you.Michael Callan plays Clay Boone, Cat's would-be love interest. Michael Callan, also known as Mickey Calin, has done tons of movies starting with They Came to Cordure in 1959. In Cat Ballou, his honest face and earnest smile captivate you right away, and his performance as Boone, holds you there. Although he's had loads of roles, most Americans will probably remember him from his stint on One Life to Live, a popular American soap opera. (He played Jack Simmons.)Frankie Ballou (Cat's Father) is played extremely well by John Marley; a curmudgeonly rancher who has definite views (however odd they may be) on the true origins of the Native American.This movie has it all! Action, suspense, comedy and heart. It also boasts some of the greatest stars of its time Jane Fonda, Lee Marvin, Dwayne Hickman, Stubby Kaye (!!) (Marvin Acme in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Ellis Island *1984,* Taxi *1953,* Guys and Dolls *1955,* and Lil Abner *1959* among many more), Reginald Denny and Bruce Cabot!The story is narrated in song by Nat King Cole, playing professor Sam The Shade AS Nat King Cole. This movie whisks you from your seat, carries you down the river, and plunges you over the waterfall. Hang on and enjoy the ride.It easily rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend .

Add to that his second role as as the noseless Tim Strawn.  Toss in the matter-of-fact way the Kid reveals that he and Tim had been brothers.And leave us not forget my favorite scene -- the suiting up of the Kid prior to the ultimate showdown.  It's almost like the investiture of an ancient high priest, down to the acolyte-like functioning of Jackson Two-Bears (played to perfection by Tom Nardini).  Absolutely no dialogue, and set, as I recall, to music reminiscent of the Spanish corridas.If anyone draws up a list of Lee Marvin's best films, they'd have to be nuts to not put this in the top three.  His Best Actor Oscar for this film was well-deserved.And equally high marks to whomever did the stunt work for Marvin.  The antics on horseback during the last scenes, with a drunken Kid Shelleen in the saddle, have to be seen to be believed.By all means, see this movie.  Be ready to cheer for the bad guys as they seek revenge against the badder guys.  But do NOT, under any circumstances, think for a minute that the movie as shown on TNT is complete.  The last time they aired it, they actually CUT part of the above-mentioned dressing scene -- an unforgivable sin of omission, in my book.  Rent (or buy) the video or DVD instead.

Along for the ride are Clay Boone (Michael Callan), a handsome young felon who is sheltered by Cat and falls in love with her; Jed (Dwayne Hickman), Clay's Bible-thumping uncle, and Jackson Two-Bears (Tom Nardini, who is hilarious), the Ballou's hired hand who philosophically comments on the treatment of Native Americans.  Nat King Cole and Stubby Kaye are enjoyable as troubadours who sing the plot of the movie as it moves along.  Fonda never looked more beautiful, Marvin is a hoot (as Shelleen and his twin brother, the silver-nosed Tim Strawn), and the screenplay (by Walter Newman, Frank R.

Yep, it's a sex Western, one that gives us the one-of-a-kind performances of Fonda and of Lee Marvin, who has two roles - an alcoholic gunslinger who's supposed to be Cat's saving and a mean, dastardly hit man with a prosthetic nose - and who won himself an Oscar for his delightful work. But it's not just the lighthearted performances of the actors that floats this film, it's also the riveting, uproarious script. The pace is never dull - there are some Westerns that'll slow things down to kind of add mood to a story, but not this one. This would make a nice double-bill with another of Fonda's sexy early roles, Barbarella. "},{"Title":"What's the Matter?

What she did not know is that Marvin is way past his prime and has turned into little more than an alcoholic lush. An assassin (Marvin again) with a fake nose does eventually get to Marley and now it is up to Fonda, Marvin and company to bring the men who killed her father to justice. Oh did I mention that the story is told via musical interludes by Nat King Cole and Stubby Kaye? Cat Ballou is a wild and uproarious movie that works really well due to its creative ideas. Part Western, part musical, part comedy and part drama, the movie creates a large jumble that actually works amazingly well.

It's because it vaulted Lee Marvin up from the ranks of featured players and made him a star with an hysterical Oscar winning performance.It's also the only time in film history that anyone won an Oscar for a dual role. Marvin is featured as deadly contract killer, Jack Strawn and as his alcoholic brother Kid Shelleen.The brothers get into a range feud and opposite sides. An eastern conglomerate headed by Reginald Denny is putting the squeeze on John Marley right at the same time as his daughter Jane Fonda in the title role is coming back from eastern finishing school. Marley and Fonda have a hired killer strong arming them, so at the suggestion of a curious gang of friends she's developed, Michael Callan, Dwayne Hickman, and Tom Nardini, she goes and gets her own outlaw. Of course the dueling Marvins do have it out and I think you can guess who won.Sometimes it's easy to forget about some of the others in Cat Ballou because of Marvin's Oscar. Jane Fonda looks like she's having a great old time, satirizing certain themes that are sacred in Hollywood westerns. She plays her role as the budding Calamity Jane absolutely straight and lets the comedy fall around her.One favorite I have from the film is Hollywood veteran Reginald Denny. In the old days he was usually a rival or best friend to various leading men in the Hollywood English colony. He looks like he's having one grand old time playing the rakish Harry Percival the chief villain of Cat Ballou.The film is helped along with those singing narrations by Nat King Cole and Stubby Kaye. At one time Cole and Kaye are in a bordello and he's both singing and playing the honky tonk piano. Since Cole's velvet syrupy singing is what most remember him for, it's good to remember that in the beginning Cole was a jazz pianist and his original records were with the Nat King Cole Trio as a pianist. His singing was something added and then took over his career. Cole was one of the great and most unique voices of the last century, he left us way too soon.Four years later John Wayne won his Oscar for the boozy Rooster Cogburn in True Grit. What I would have loved to have seen is Wayne and Marvin playing their Oscar winning characters in a dual venture. That would have been a movie to remember.As is the funny and touching Cat Ballou.

When they get him sobered up enough to show his skill and in a demonstration of shooting, he misses the barn. He and his horse leaning against a building, both of them apparently drunk. Kid's rendition of Happy Birthday at the funeral of Cat's father. The ongoing chorus of The Ballad of Cat Ballou with Stubby Kaye and Nat King Cole.

It is side-splittingly hilarious,well-acted, anti-Establishment, borders on parody and has a storyline that belongs in a dramatic film. And it is a western comedy, another scarce category. Any account of this film must begin with its story, an unusual one as noted. Cakthrine Ballou meets several strangers on her way west, by train, to rejoin her father Frankie. Soon after her arrival, he is murdered. The authorities refuse to do anything. What happens next is, Cat Ballou and her friends, who happen to be he outlaws she had met, join with her Indian hired hand have already sent for a gunfighter--Kid Shellene who was supposed to protect her father. Falling in love with her, the Kid sobers up, dispatches, his own brother; then the gang ride off to new adventures, with the Kid drinking again because she's refused him for another of her henchman and they're wanted for having helped hasten the demise of the man who had had her father killed. Th settings and locales in the film are standard western ones, and very fine; the film is well-made without ever appearing to be slick. So is the music by Frank de Vol and unusual songs scattered throughout. The piece's able director Elliot Silverstein has coaxed some of their best work ever from Jane Fonda as Cat, Michael Callan as her outlaw fiancée, Dwayne Hickman as a bogus preacher, John Marley as her father, Reginald Denny, J.C. Flippen and Bruce Cabot as the criminal element and Lee Marvin as the besotted gunfighter and his killer brother. There is an unusual narration, sung expertly and winningly Subby Kaye and Nat King Cole. The costumes by Bill Thomas are wonderful, and there is a rough-and-ready style about the work that millions have found engaging. The dialogue from a novel is well-above average also. This is a film that bears more than one viewing; it is clever, intentionally funny and quire well-constructed. Recommended to anyone who resents bullies or simply enjoys a well-earned laugh twelve.

(Think of the singers who open and close There's Something About Mary.) Unfortunately Nat Cole was already fighting lung cancer while the film was being made and he died before it opened.Leaves you wondering why Hollywood just doesn't make films like this anymore. No special effects, no obscenity and no gratuitous sex. Humor arises from the characters and from the screenplay.

I thought Lee Marvin was quite creative in this role, but I don't really know why he won an Oscar.  However I do think it's good that the Academy actually gave out Oscars for comedies, something they seem to do very little these days, fearing appearing too light-hearted.  Anyway, Fonda does fine, although I found Stubby Kaye and Nat King Cole a bit offputting with their narration.  Perhaps it was meant to be a nice diversion, but, perhaps given my more ironic viewpoint of this day and age, I thought that it seemed out of place in the film.  It seemed counter to the tone of the movie and intrusive.  It worked in There's Something About Mary, but not here-though they both have great voices.

It stars Jane Fonda, Lee Marvin, Michael Callan, Dwayne Hickman, Tom Nardini, John Marley, Nat King Cole and Stubby Kaye. Catherine Ballou (Fonda), a prim and proper school teacher wannabe, returns home to Wolf City to find her father at loggerheads with the local development corporation. When things get dreadfully serious, she decides to do something about it, putting herself at the head of a nutty gang, which brings her into contact with famed boozy gunfighter Kid Shelleen (Marvin).It's a quirky comedy Western, spoofing the Wild West while still containing some respect of the era. The tonal flows are patchy, as are the gags - both visually and orally, but it always entertains with honesty and ebullience. Fonda is simply beautiful and adorable, making Cat vulnerable but stoic as well, her waspish tongue delivering some great dialogue. Nardini as Indian Jackson Two-Bears also shines bright with some great comedy moments.Marvin owns the film though, in what was an Oscar winning performance, he plays a dual role, where the prominent character is a riotous booze hound, so something about life imitating art there! The locations are gorgeous and beautifully photographed, and the musical links to the story segments provided by Cole (sadly to pass away before the pic was released) and Kaye as wandering minstrels, prove to be jolly and nifty in equal measure.Throw in some gun play, a fun horse and a rollicking train robbery and you are good to go.

Lee Marvin co-starred with her in a dual role as the ruthless killer Tim Strawn and the alcoholic gunslinger Kid Shelleen whose life has been immortalized in dime novels. Cat's father Frankie (John Marley) owns land that the Wolf City Development Company wants. When conventional methods such as stuffing manure down his well doesn't work to force Frankie to sell, the Wolf City bunch dispatches Tim Strawn. Strawn is an evil looking gunman who wears a tin nose over his nose that was bitten off in a fight. Before Frankie dies, Cat summons Kid Shelleen for $50 to help them. Frankie is astonished to learn that Shelleen is an alcoholic. As it turns out, Shelleen shoots well when he is boozed up. He can strike a tin can flying through the air with a single shot. After Frankie dies, Shelleen takes the outcast Cat and her companions, Clay Boone (Michael Callen) and Jed (Dwayne Hickman), and her Native American pal Jackson Two-Bears (Tom Nardini) to the infamous Hole-in-the-Wall hideout. Our heroine plans to rob a train. As it turns out, the man who owns the train is an Englishman, Sir Harry Percival (the ever dependable Reginald Denny), who is the man behind the Wolf City dastards. Our heroine kills Sir Harry by accident when she brandishes a pistol and they struggle over it. During their scuffle, the gun discharges and kills Sir Harry. Cat is imprisoned in the Wolf City jail and sentenced to hang on the gallows. Naturally, our heroes arrange to rescue our heroine. The scene when the drunken Shelleen is sitting astraddle his horse that is leaning against the wall of a store with its fore hoofs crossed is very funny. Lee Marvin won an Academy Award for her performance. Stubby Kaye and Nate King Cole play a charismatic pair of balladeers who appear at intervals to warble and strum the ballad of Cat Ballou. This film bears striking resemblance to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid in certain parts. Jane Fonda is gorgeous as usual and endearing as the heroine.

It was before Butch and Sundance, before the US saw Fistful. Before even Bonny and Clyde.It is, I think our first mainstream Hollywood movie influenced by the (French) new wave. You might not see because it is buried under the reinvention of the Western, a lather of comedy and the greetings of sex, such as they were for the era. And of course, you might not see it because of the roles taken by the two main actors since; she as a lighting rod for upset over social failure, he as target for girlfriend's extortionist lawyer.But there's value in here. Oh, the movie is entertaining enough in its own way, but you never watch these old important things without revisiting its place in the genealogy of mind. Books, its all about the word. We have a virginal schoolmarm turned outlaw. We have a book about a gunslinger turned (reluctantly) into a human rendition of the same (in the process, killing his other self). In an unrelated scene, we literally have a gun come out of a book. We have the words of a ballad become the movie, at the same time we see the movie begin as a hand turning pages in a book (that a geezer reads).Its Titian brought to the west on a train. Its notions of self-reference made tame and in the service of embedded story. Its odd how much more deft these were than their French counterparts.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3 Worth watching.

Most of the film is an extended backstory telling us how she got there. The backstory starts with Ballou headed back home to Wolf City, Wyoming. It seems that her father, Frankie (John Marley), is having problems with the city, which wants to take over the water rights on his land, and which is prepared to do anything necessary to get it. On the way, Ballou meets and enlists the aid of two crooks, Clay Boone (Michael Callan) and Jed (Dwayne Hickman). Even with the additional aid of Frankie's ranch-hand, Jackson Two-Bears (Tom Nardini), they're not enough, so she also sends for famed gunfighter Kid Shelleen (Lee Marvin).Cat Ballou is a good example of comedy in the classic literary sense. Comedy doesn't mean a work that is funny, just like horror doesn't mean a work that is scary. Genre terms do not imply particular emotions. Rather, they're about content and how content is handled. So comedies need not make you laugh, as this one did not make me laugh very frequently, even though some other people found it very funny. That might be one key to enjoying the film, especially for younger or newer audiences--do not watch it expecting to laugh until you cry, or even necessarily laugh at all.Cat Ballou is worth watching, but it's not excellent, at least not until Marvin makes his appearance, and that doesn't occur until about 40 minutes into the film. If Cat Ballou were primarily Marvin's performance, it would be at least a 9. The other material is at best a 6, and dominates enough to bring my overall score down to a 7 out of 10.The problem, for me, is that the other performances are just serviceable. To an extent, most of the actors do not seem to know what to do with the material. The story is much more serious than you'd expect--the same plot could be lifted wholesale and put into a non-comedy western. It wouldn't likely be a very good serious western, though, as the plot is also formulaic and uninspired. None of the characters, with the exception of Ballou, are established very well, and I never really cared what happened to any of them. On the other hand, as a comedy, that might not be so important, and the comic approach somewhat saves the otherwise generic story.Director Elliot Silverstein's pacing tends to be off, and even after Marvin appears, the film occasionally seems to drag. This is one of those films that's just barely over 90 minutes, but it seems like it's three hours long. That's not always a bad thing (I like long films), but in a lighthearted satire, it may not be the best quality.Cole and Kaye are promising when we first see them, but the intermittent songs tend to go on too long, and most of them are the same song with different lyrics. I enjoyed them quite a bit at first, but after I while, my reaction to them was more, Oy, now the film is going to stop for five minutes while they sing over and over about plot points that we've just been shown.However, as I mentioned above, Marvin's performance is excellent (the discussion about whether he should have won the Oscar he did for this role is inconsequential to me--I strongly dislike the Oscars, never watch them (I dislike awards shows in general), and think that they routinely acknowledge poor films and ignore good ones; I have no respect for the Academy). He is amusing as an alcoholic gunfighter. I wanted to know more about his character, to follow him instead of Ballou. He brought depth to the role, easily implying a character with a complex backstory. The scene where we're introduced to Shelleen is easily the best in the film. The only really captivating scene where Shelleen is not the primary focus is the extended scene on the train.Again, Cat Ballou is worth watching, but lower your expectations and have patience. It gets better once Marvin shows up. "}{"Title":"They got a gunfighter.

His competition that year were Richard Burton, Laurence Olivier, Rod Steiger and Oskar Werner. I've seen none of the nominated pictures those actors appeared in so I'm in no position to judge, but come on. How does a drunken gunslinger out-shoot those other big names on reputation alone? Well I see this Western has it's following based on some of the other reviews on this board, but a lot of the film didn't resonate with this viewer. It was OK as far as it goes, but some of it was a little too slapstick for my liking. And I couldn't connect with characters Clay Boone (Michael Callan), Uncle Jed (Dwayne Hickman) or even Jackson Two-Bears (Tom Nardini), even though he offered promise as a Ballou ranch hand. Say, I wonder if the horse's head in the 'Godfather' movie came from the Ballou Ranch. That was John Marley as the principal in both situations, wouldn't that have been something? One thing I did like about the picture was the reference to Hole in the Wall and the depiction of Butch Cassidy (Arthur Hunnicutt) as a washed up gunfighter running a general store. That was kind of clever, even if totally devoid of historical accuracy. There was also that very well choreographed square dance number with performers hooking up with each other out of nowhere, surprisingly well done if you ask me.And oh yes, can't forget to mention Reginald Denny in his role as Sir Harry Percival. He caught my eye as butler Algy Longworth in the Bulldog Drummond flicks of the 1930's with an understated sardonic wit that made me a fan. He took that tumble out of the bathtub on the train about the same way he would have three decades earlier if he had ever gotten the chance. It was cool to see him here.Overall though this was kind of a take it or leave it picture for me. It had some pretty good press back in the day, so maybe getting around to it a half century later isn't the worst thing I could do with my time. At least the march of time brought some recognition to the minstrel characters in the story; Nat King Cole was listed as Sam the Shade and Stubby Kaye went by Sunrise Kid in captioning when I watched it on Encore Westerns.

Riding into history with Cat are legendary drunken gunslinger Kid Shelleen (Lee Marvin), loyal injun ranch-hand Jackson Two-Bears (Tom Nardini), and a pair of wanted cattle rustlers, Clay Boone (Michael Callan) and his Uncle Jed (Dwayne Hickman).Cat Ballou trades heavily on Fonda's sex kitten appeal, but there's much more to the film than its coquettish star and her heavenly cleavage the film also benefits from a wonderfully witty screenplay, superb direction from Elliot Silverstein, the amazing vocal talents of Cole and Kaye, and lively performances from all involved, most notably Marvin, who not only plays Kid Shelleen with impeccable comic timing, but also his wicked brother Strawn, a hired killer with a silver nose.There are plenty of memorable moments throughout this enjoyable comedy/western romp, but for my money the standout scenes are a lively barn-dance scene (executed with a single shot!), Kid Shelleen's training montage and his transformation from drunken bum to slick gunslinger, and Cat posing as a Mae West style vamp named Trixie, star Fonda simply oozing va-va-voom in a sexy, spangled dress designed to thrill.

Jane Fonda is sweet and very pretty in the title role, and the entire cast, particularly Dwayne Hickman and Tom Nardini in supporting roles, is likable and a pleasure to watch.

Ms. Fonda comes home from school to find her father killed by a corrupt town. Fonda's gang assembles - Michael Callan, whom she meets in bed, Tom Nardini, an Indian ranchman, and Dwayne Hickman, a young uncle. Since none of them can shoot, they hire gunslinger Lee Marvin for $50.00. Sadly, Mr. Marvin is delivered in a drunken stupor; he can hardly stand up, let alone defend Jane.Director Elliot Silverstein keeps the pace very lively; there is always something going on, or about to happen - most of it funny. The movie is a spoof of the western. If you can't stomach western spoofery, you may not enjoy the film, which could be your loss. The scene I found funniest (but not the laugh out loud funniest) was when Mr. Nardini was preparing Mr. Marvin for the big confrontation. Nardini takes out a girdle to squeeze on Marvin's body - you can picture dozens of aging western actors going through the same thing just to appear in front of the movie camera! I imagine there were a lot of long faces on western actors, while watching Cat Ballou (if they dared). Jay C Flippen and some western regulars give the movie some authenticity - they must have seen their share of drunken western actors. Nardini is also an Indian who does NOT ACT LIKE A WESTERN MOVIE Indian. He corrects educated Fonda's grammar (Whom). Watch how he scalps someone in the early brawl&#x85; watch his salute to the prepared-to-fight Marvin.

You can easily tell it made money because of the number of sequels it spawned -- Support Your Local Sheriff, Waterhole Number 3, -- and the many others it undoubtedly influenced. There had been comic Westerns before, but few major productions ever took the conventions and deliberately stood them on their heads just for laughs.Lee Marvin certainly earned his Academy Award. It's easy to play a stumbling drunk, but Marvin did it most creatively. He doesn't only fumble around and bang into objects and knock things over -- he kind of begins a movement and then stops in the middle of it, like a statue or a tableau, his arms and legs at odd angles, staring in some completely irrelevant direction, a flashbulb photo of someone caught in the throes of Paul Taylor's choreography. Wardrobe and makeup outdid themselves. Marvin isn't simply disheveled. He's filthy, a tattered rag upon a stick.The director doesn't seem to have realized what a treasure he had in Lee Marvin's performance and in the value of the dialog Marvin is given (I'll drink to THAT!). Unnecessary slapstick crops up from time to time. A stunt man rides a horse pretending to be drunk, half falling off, whirling in circles. So what? It's the WAY Marvin puts his character across that works, not scenes that could have been shot 50 years earlier.Actually, Lee Marvin isn't alone in hefting this slight story over the bar. Jane Fonda helps. Yes, okay, she sounds like she just left Vassar -- but, wow, the abundance of her pulchritude. I don't care if she sounds like Queen Elizabeth as long as she looks and acts like the 27-year-old Jane Fonda that she in fact was.The rest of the cast varies from professionally competent to barely passable. Stubby Kaye and Nat King Cole provide a kind of Greek chorus that's playful but sad too, reminding a viewer of Cole's uniquely satisfying vernacular singing voice. And, in truth, the dialog doesn't really sparkle. But it hardly matters when Marvin in a gunfighter so dissolute that when he shoots at a target tacked on the barn wall, he misses the broad side of the barn.

The supporting characters, including the amazing Lee Marvin are unforgettable. Lee Marvin, in dual roles of Kid Sheelan and the baddie Tim Strawn leaves a lasting impression. His drunken gunslinger steals every scene he is in bar none. He plays the part with hilarious conviction and Jane Fonda plays her role with just the right amount of innocence, anger and sexiness. Always worth watching. John Marley plays Cat's father. He is hilarious as the rancher who refues to cooperate with the local authorities.

I give this movie a 5 rating and I'll break it down why.2 Stars for Lee Marvins performance. Everyone else is pretty much off in their performance and that's due also to bad pacing, directing and a poor script. But Marvin saves the movie in some sense. Lee Marvin has one of the best scenes in the movie where he goes to confront his brother, but the scene is so out of context, it belongs in a completely different movie. I think Marvin should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor and maybe won in that category, but winning for Best Actor? He's not the lead by far in this movie.I give 3 stars for just looking at Jane Fonda. Her legs and buttocks are to die for, she was always a workout fiend on her legs and it shows in this movie. They talk about how J-Lo started the big booty craze, but really Jane Fonda did in some way, she has a huge booty for a white woman, one with muscle and definition too. So I give 3 stars just for drooling over her body in this one. And she's always nice to look at in the face too.Other than that, this one isn't worth much of a look.

The film opens with Catherine 'Cat' Ballou (Golden Globe nominated Jane Fonda) who is behind bars awaiting hanging, then it goes into flashback to see why. Basically Catherine and her family were being threatened by th Rail Road, and when her father Frankie (John Marley) is killed the gunman with no nose (a metal) one to replace), Tim Strawn (quick glimpses of the leading man), the psychopathic brother of the leading male hero. Catherine sends for Kid Shelleen (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Lee Marvin) who is meant to have great shooting skills, but and the others, including Jackson Two-Bears (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated newcomer Tom Nardini) weren't expecting a drunk. But he proves himself a good shot even taking a swig of alcohol, and he helps a vengeful and now outlaw Cat succeed in a train robbery, and more importantly kill Kid's evil brother. She is jailed by the way for (accidently) killing Sir Harry Percival (Reginald Denny), but Kid, Jackson and Clay Boone (Michael Callan) save her from hanging, and they all ride off into the distance. Between scenes, the story is told in the Oscar and Golden Globe nominated The Ballad of Cat Ballou by the singers Nat 'King' Cole (who I know best for The Christmas Song (Merry Christmas To You)) and Stubby Kaye. Also starring Dwayne Hickman as Jed, Jay C. Flippen as Sheriff Cardigan, Arthur Hunnicutt as Butch Cassidy and Bruce Cabot as Sheriff Maledon. Marvin of course is fantastic as a drunk character, and Fonda has her moments too. The highlight for me is Jackson dressing Kid in his new black and silver suit and hat when he has for a while sobered up, and the moments that did make me giggle is Marvin singing Happy Birthday in front of the Menorah candle and blowing it out, and him opening the doors to hear screaming women. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Music for Frank De Vol and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, and it was nominated Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy. Jane Fonda was number 98 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and the film was number 50 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!

Still, it was only now – on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of Lee Marvin’s death – that I finally sat down to watch CAT BALLOU! A fairly original Western premise – not least because of its outlaw heroine – is played out in comedy vein though not a spoof per se, the film does put down the myth of the Western gunfighter by having Marvin’s Kid Shellene as an amiable but useless drunk (until he gets his act together, that is – leading to what’s probably the first instance of a character’s quasi-fetishistic preparation before engaging in some bout of action).In itself, the film is quite good and certainly very enjoyable (also due to the presence of Nat King Cole and Stubby Kaye as a couple of minstrels who act as Chorus to the main plot) – but that’s it I wouldn’t call it a great Western and its classic status, basically, relies solely on the fact that the picture landed Marvin a rather surprising Oscar! In fact, too often he’s made to play second-fiddle to the young folk – though Jane Fonda is, of course, spirited and gorgeous. She’s romantically pursued throughout by no less than four men Marvin himself, two outlaw relatives (one of whom has a penchant of dressing up as a priest, usually to get the other out of a jam!) and her father’s Indian farmhand. Still, Marvin’s undeniably superb playing two parts – the second, appearing only intermittently, as the film’s menacing ‘silver-nosed’ villain (is his the only dual role to win an Oscar, I wonder?).The supporting cast also features John Marley – uncharacteristically droll as Fonda’s father, whose stubbornness rubs everybody the wrong way (a soused Marvin, then, hilariously mistakes a stack of candles placed in front of Marley’s coffin as a birthday arrangement…and promptly puts them out!) – and veteran character actor Reginald Denny as the stereotypical English twit (his attempts at taking a bath during a train robbery are priceless) – who, eventually, turns out to be the unscrupulous developer who hired the thuggish Marvin to dispose of the opposition! I’ve a number of other Lee Marvin films in my collection which I’ve never watched or have just one viewing to their name but, as I’ve said on other occasions, this month’s been really crowded with tributes – so I’ve had to narrow it down to just one title for the moment, and what better choice than the film for which his unique talents were recognized by his peers...

The film incorporates many of the clichés of westerns including a corrupt sheriff that fails to prevent illegal activities and typical revenge story, but succeeds by taking a humorous approach to the material.Jane Fonda leads the cast with a solid performance as Cat Ballou. Lee Marvin is famous for playing two roles in this movie, that of Kid Shelleen, a hired gunslinger, and Tim Strawn, the film's chief villain. His performance as Kid Shelleen is the more notable of the two since it gets a lot more screen time. Lee Marvin gives a skilled and hilarious performance in the role. The supporting cast was notable, particularly Tom Nardini, who had some memorable lines as Jackson (particularly when he corrects Cat's grammar), John Marley as Cat's father Frank and Michael Callan as Clay Boone.The film's story is well-placed with consistent humor punctuated with some dramatic moments. Also notable is the inclusion of intermittent segments of catchy banjo music and songs performed by Nat King Cole and Stubby Kale. The best of these performances was the song The Ballad of Cat Ballou that introduces the film. Cat Ballou is an amusing version of the typical western story.

They gave her a very wholesome look, with her hair especially youthful looking. Pretty much all the guys in the baby boomer generation fell in love with her when they saw this film in 1965, whether they were five or 25. And pretty much all the characters in the film fall in love with her as well. This was her first film targeted at the boomer demographic and her young appearance and relative obscurity were deceptive to her new fans. Six years later when Klute was released folks were staggered by how used up she looked, generally because everyone had just assumed that she was younger. In 1965 it was revolutionary for to see a film with such a strong, determined, brave, and resourceful young woman, especially for a western. Although Joan Crawford, Shelley Winters, and Peggy Castle had previously played tough saloon owners, there had never been anyone quite like Fonda's character. The times were a changin or at least beginning to change and this film both reflected and contributed to these changes.If you are thinking of watching Cat Ballou for the first time be aware that it has the standard 1960's western production design. Things are very studio back lot, very clean, and extremely orderly (insert not authentic here). And although classified as a comedy it is as much action/adventure as comedy. The humorous elements are mostly supplied by Lee Marvin doing a parody of the heavy roles he usually played. Stubby Kaye and Nat King Cole bookend the film as banjo playing western minstrels and also function as musical narrators who pop up within scenes throughout the movie, singing the story as it unfolds. This really complicates the staging of these scenes and it is worth just paying attention to the clever ways they are worked into the scenes.After an introduction the story flashes back and then proceeds linearly forward, by the end they are back to the time of the introduction. The flashback first finds Catherine (Cat) Ballou boarding a train after completing finishing school. She is returning to her father's Wyoming ranch. On the trip she is reading a pulp western about a gunfighter named Kid Shelleen (Marvin). She meets escaping rustler Clay Boone (Michael Callan) and his drunk Uncle Jed (Dwayne Hickman) who is dressed as a preacher. She arrives home to find her father's ranch in bad shape. Her father is being pressured to sell out to a British railroad baron. Cat Ballou is a fun film with a nice soundtrack. Fonda and Marvin are especially good. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

From that point on, until the last few minutes, the movie is a flashback, explaining to the viewer the series of misadventures Cat experienced as she set out to avenge her father's murder, finally getting herself into the mess she was in. In all honesty, I didn't care much for this movie. Fonda's performance as Cat (evolving from a naive young schoolteacher into the leader of an outlaw gang) was pretty good, but beyond that I didn't find much to get excited about, and I cannot for the life of me figure out what it was about Lee Marvin's performance as both Kid Shelleen and Tim Strawn that won him an Oscar as Best Lead Actor for 1965. It's not that he did a bad job, but I certainly wouldn't have thought of it as Oscar-worthy. A dozen other actors could probably have taken the role and done just as well with it. The repeated cuts to Nat King Cole and Stubby Kaye singing about Cat's experiences also threw me off, especially when it was so obvious that they weren't even playing the banjos they were holding (they'd be plucking them while there was no sound, then when there was sound they wouldn't be plucking.) Basically, this was nothing more than a series of at best mildly amusing misadventures, with some tired slapstick humour thrown in (especially by Marvin when playing the drunken gunfighter Shelleen) and a weak attempt at developing a romance between Cat and Clay (Michael Callan). Overall, I'd say this was a huge disappointment - which is perhaps explained by the fact that the novel on which it was based was a serious Western that was turned into a comedy for the big screen. It didn't work - at least, not in my opinion.

The opening song pretty much warns you that what you're about to witness is going to be total cheese. Along with the total disbelief that's actually Nat King Cole singing it as a duet with some unknown ugly fat guy.But it gets worse. The first step down is during the opening credits, when you see somebody actually thought it would be a good idea to cast Jane Fonda in a Western, even worse, a Western Comedy (and I use that term loosely in this case). Seriously, Jane Fonda in a Western Comedy???After a few minutes of poor acting, unbelievably bad dialog, out of no where, Nat and the unknown ugly fat guy suddenly appear and lay the same painfully long opening theme song on you again. Why? Maybe in case some people were out getting popcorn during the first time they played it?I guess the best way to describe this comedy is that it seems like it was written and directed by the same people that plagued the earth with the Monkees TV show back in the 60's. Same poor script, cheesy acting, lame sight gags, sound effects and twangy background music... that apparently is supposed to make the funny antics and double-takes seem funnier. But it greatly fails.Finally, if you loved the Monkees, found that style of comedy enjoyable, can suspend disbelief long enough to actually buy Jane Fonda as a comedian in a Western, you'll love this film.

He had a point. Marvin manages to play funny better than you expect from his stone-cold screen image, but there's nothing in Cat Ballou that makes you think legend, even if the film itself tackles that very subject.Marvin plays Kid Shaleen, some 20 years ago a legendary terrorizer of the Old West. Now he's just a sad old drunk whose stories inspire prim young maiden Catherine Ballou (Jane Fonda) to seek his help when it comes to protecting - and later avenging, her father against the nasty town of Wolf City, Wyoming. Shaleen may only be a legend in Catherine's mind, but she inspires him to pick up his six-shooters, and he inspires her to join him as desperada Cat Ballou.I'm gonna make Sherman's March to the Sea look like a bird walk, she vows, enlisting some others along the way to her train-robbing band.Fonda is fetching, which means she wears a lot of tight clothes well enough for me to almost ignore her overly correct diction. Supporting players Michael Callan and Dwayne Hickman as a goofy pair of outlaws eat up more screen time than they deserve - a romance between Cat and Callan's character chewing up long sections of pointless dialogue. Stubby Kaye and Nat King Cole perform musical interludes, a concept borrowed to better effect in There's Something About Mary. Apparently the filmmakers thought they had a hit song with The Ballad Of Cat Ballou, but it's like gum on a car seat for me.But when Marvin is at the center, the film plays rather well, even with him wearing a silly George Washington wig and even when Marvin himself is subbed on the horse-riding stunts by another Hollywood legend, Yakima Canutt. The first time we see Marvin as Shaleen (he appears first in his other role, that of the ruthless bad man Tim Strawn), he expertly works the comedy by playing the pathos. Just the way he turns around, eyes tunnels of bottomless pain, when Catherine calls him a drunk, is worth the DVD price for me.Shaleen rallies with a belt of whiskey in his gut, but soon he's out of gas again, and falling out of his pants. I've never seen a man go through a day so fast, Callan's character remarks, his best line.Director Elliot Silverstein didn't seem to do comedy too well; he overplays the dramatic elements too much and switches inexpertly between broad farce and action slapstick. He does shoot one nifty sequence, the Fall Harvest Day dance, centered by a single running camera shot. Even with some unnecessary inserts, the sequence develops a special rhythm in simultaneously establishing multiple story points, and ends with a satisfying if goofy fight.Goofy is a good word for Cat Ballou, in all kinds of ways. They didn't make Cat cry, as the song goes, and they didn't make me laugh much, either. But at least I got to enjoy Marvin try.

My world doesn't revolve around Dark Knight and Avatar.To give you an idea of where my tastes lie at the moment, my wife and I have spent the summer THRILLED that we finally have a DVR attached to TCM.So maybe you think we're not big on Westerns. Nope. Having moved out West from America's East years ago, we've finally embraced the genre. In fact, we're seeing and enjoying a lot of Westerns from this period. Finally saw HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER and BIG COUNTRY and adored both.I'm a child of 70's cinema, and so your next natural presumption is that I adored BLAZING SADDLES and can't give BALLOU a fair shake. Wrong yet again. I think Blazing is a desperate and stupid TV movie, where Young Frank is genius.Am I conservative with something against Jane Fonda? Nope. I'm a screaming liberal who must confess a downright carnal worship and Fondaness for this lifelong beauty.And so why HISS at CAT BALLOU? The movie opens with Stubby and Nat playing banjos. Something about Nat in a bright western get up playing a banjo feels like Elvis Presley dressed up like Liberace and affecting effeminate chords under a chandelier. It's not funny HA-HA but funny BAD.And it doesn't help that we meet him while walking under a stage for an intended hanging. Umm, call me racially sensitive, but 1965 wasn't a cultural kosher time to send a black man strolling underneath a gallows just as a trapdoor drops and a noose nearly bounces off his head.Reviewers on IMDb state with great joy how HILARIOUS Stubby and Nat are in these sequences. Forgive me, but these songs are repetitive, overlong, and typically as funny as a jammed office printer. The frequency with which these crooners come and go -- doing nearly the same thing -- indicates a screenplay utterly bereft of pages and story.The thing is Stubby isn't needed. Nat King Cole could sing circles around Sinatra, and if you have Nat -- that's all you need. If included at all, Nat should have been a singing gunslinger type who tipped up his hat once in a while -- revealing his presence -- to croon a quick tune -- and then back under the hat. Anymore time than this and it RIPS the viewer clear out of the story, which it did EVERY time. In SOMETHING ABOUT MARY this peculiar device worked, but here it was painful -- except for the sunset ballad Nat did around midpoint.Jane Fonda. Beauty and chops. All they needed to start the story on her and stay there. Transition from gal to gunslinger. Great idea, and so what went wrong? The film starts at the end. Giving away her what would have been her otherwise fun and fascinating transition. Hell, the animation of the Columbia Pictures chick gives it away even. For the life of me, I don't see how showing and singing about what a bad@$$ she becomes will helps the story. Now we're just sitting around waiting for it to happen instead of going delighting in her transformation. Sigh.What's worse is the transition SUCKS. Her Dad gets killed in a way befitting a drama, not a comedy. So she rides off all mad and learns that local Sheriff is going to do nothing about it. Okay, and so seemingly ten minutes later, Little Miss Emily Post decides to rob a train. Huh? Why? Does it matter? This chick robbing a train is as believable as Hannibal Lector being hired as a wedding consultant.So when she picks up the newspaper and announces her train robbery dreams, the house of cards is almost ready to collapse. But something must have been working better up to this point, right? Yes. Lee Marvin. His drunken gunslinger is funny. Please note not HILARIOUS, but funny in a promising way. In this nearly pathetic movie, of course he steals the show. Something or somebody needed to, and Marvin had the luck of the draw. But like the rest of the film, his bits were milked silly, overlong, repetitive, and... confusing.His bit was that he was a hungover alcoholic DISASTER of a gunslinger until he had enough to drink to see and shoot clearly. Okay, I love that. But then these fools RUINED it by making his window of clarity only good for a minute or two before his continued boozing ruined him again. That's not as funny an idea as -- -- having the booze make clean him up so good that he became the love interest to Fonda. That is, lose characters 'sex addict' and 'Uncle' and just have Marvin do his alcoholic Jeckyl and Hyde bit. If Fonda was becoming a boozer to get him to help her, her metamorphosis from Cute to Clint would have worked perfectly.But no, we had to watch Marvin stumble and stare off into nothing a few too many times. I'll be honest, a little past the midpoint, where the film became so desperate as to speed everything up in a Benny Hill bit that wasn't even funny... I definitely ditched. It was simply too painful a film to watch any longer. And I seldom ditch anything.CAT BALLOU was that bad. So bad... I joined IMDb to say something about it.

And Cole is never actually funny, just charming here and there. The speediest of three melodies they weave through the piece is enjoyable.I don't like Fonda in much, and it has nothing to do with politics (Give em hell, Jane!). She just always seems completely uptight. And her character has very little to do. Nothing she is given to do merits or matches the enjoyable singing setup. The plot is extremely flimsy. The humor is so broad as to make me feel I was watching a children's film. The tone is a lot like an episode of the Monkees. And when it reached it's climax, I was asking Oh, that's an ending? Though everyone raves about Lee Marvin here, he barely registered for me, as giving either a bad or a good performance.

Today, it wouldn't be made for the wide screen, and it is questionable whether it could even find financial backing for TNT or HBO.It was released in 1965, and those of us who were in our teens, or twenties, or thirties at that time will remember that it was an era of cute movies. Does the name Tom Jones mean anything to you?  Or, It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World?  Or, What's New, Pussycat??  Or, Those Magnificent Men and Their Flying Machines?  Or, God forbid, the Beatles' Help!?  Remember? Ugh.I can honestly say that, if it weren't for American International's biker flicks, I would have stopped watching movies for about five years.But, I digress.  It is astonishing that Lee Marvin won the Oscar for Best Actor.  His part is too small, and he played himself.  Contrast the demands of his role to the demands placed on any of this year's nominees for Best Actor.  Do you see what I mean about movies in the mid-60's?  The story, itself, could have been told in a one-hour segment of the TV show, Bonanza, when the Adam, Hoss, and Little Joe needed a humorous episode.On a brighter note, Jane Fonda is very attractive, and does very well despite the silly lines she is made to say and the non-entities who are on site to provide support.  One has to wonder why she ever submitted to Barbarella three years later.This is a pleasant, yet silly, movie made in the mid-60's, when viewers had too few diversions and too much time on their hands.

We ask only that it be funny.*Cat Ballou,* I care not what others may say, is not funny.The lack of laughs in this alleged comedy is rivaled by the lack of romantic chemistry between Jane Fonda and her small-time-crook boyfriend. Will he run off to St. Louis? Will he talk her into joining him? Does anyone care?Jane Fonda could *never* act. Her movie stardom was based entirely on her (admittedly stunning) looks and her family connections to Hollywood.Lee Marvin turns in a characteristically solid performance as Kid Chelleen, but even he can't carry this movie.I really tried to like the shouters (Nat King Cole and Stubby Kaye) but their main contribution to this film is to bring to it the unavoidable absurdity of the musical, without the excuse of the movie being a musical. And the Cat Ballou song is just annoying.WARNING It's the next paragraph that contains the spoilers. Well, sort of. Anyone with three brain cells will see these particular plot developments coming a mile away anyway, but still....And I don't even understand the whole Tim Strawn thing. First, they have Lee Marvin play Strawn and Chelleen, even though the fact that they are brothers is apparently supposed to be a surprise...I think. And why make them brothers? The film gets precisely zero dramatic mileage out of this relationship. A perfunctory and unconvincing You killed your own brother? reaction from Fonda, and Strawn is forgotten. And all this is done for a character who does nothing which could not be as easily handled by a nameless thug with a bandanna over his face. And why the prosthetic nose? The only thing I can think is that they did all these things simply to set up the lame surprise where Chelleen, wearing the nose, jokingly pretends to be Strawn.This is one of those movies whose popularity among both audiences and critics I find simply astonishing.

Slightly. Or as another reviewer on this site put it forgettable, if in some respects funny. Sort of. And all the more forgettable in that it features some highly talented actors and one genius singer. All of whose performances are mediocre because the play itself is so mediocre. A film which would by now be entirely forgotten if it had not, by some evil miracle, won a Best Actor Oscar. And thereby hangs a tale, because that Oscar will be remembered for eternity as by far the most undeserved Oscar ever awarded.The other nominees for Best Actor were Rod Steiger in The Pawnbroker, Richard Burton in The Spy Who Came In From the Cold, Laurence Olivier in Othello, and Oscar Werner in Ship of Fools. I challenge anyone of sound mind to see any of those films and then disagree that all four were stellar performances by transcendently talented actors. (Even if I believe, as I do, that Olivier's Othello was an indefensible interpretation of what Shakespeare wrote, it was a hell of a job of acting.) If you imagine that Lee Marvin's performance in Cat Ballou touches any of its four competitors with a ten-foot pole, you could imagine anything.True, film producers can be stupid. They can come up with sticks like Heaven's Gate, Dune, and the Branagh Frankenstein, and promote them as classics for the ages. They can fail to cast Angela Lansbury as the title character in Mame, or Jason Robards as Hickey in The Iceman Cometh, or Julie Andrews in My Fair Lady, even when each is available to reprise the stage role. They can conceive the idiotic idea of metamorphosing great TV series into so-so films by kidding themselves that someone other than David Janssen or Phil Silvers or Peter Graves(respectively) can play Richard Kimble or Sergeant Bilko or Phelps. They can and did do all these things. Why, one year they even nominated the title number from What's New Pussycat for Best Song!But the nominating committee that put this perfectly average (if that) B-grade film in the running with five such classics deserves the fate of Ixion. You can quote me.

Sure, he's amusing as a whisky guzzling gunman (and his evil brother in a few abrupt scenes)--but this was a year in which other performances were more impressive, including Rod Steiger in THE PAWNBROKER who was expected to win.This is the sort of fluffy western that passes the time quickly but is easily forgotten and not as hilarious as it was obviously intended to be. The songs sung by Nat King Cole and Stubby Kaye are not top caliber and not really necessary in keeping the mood of the film non-serious. The script and acting makes it obvious that we're not supposed to take any of this seriously.My only complaint as far as the acting goes is that Dwayne Hickman overacts his role to the nth degree--and makes his part more irritating than it ought to be. Jane Fonda looks in her prime (and the camera clearly loves her) and Michael Callan does nicely as the guy who is smitten with her. Whatever happened to him, by the way?? Never made too many films.Some of the sight gags are funny and everyone seems to be in on the humorous aspects of the story. Especially good is Tom Nardini as Jackson Two-Bears. Jane shows that she always had a flair for this kind of comedy romp--tomboyish and charming all the way. Too bad she got so mixed up in her leftist political leanings not long afterwards.

True, he's only disguised as a man of the cloth, but the visual-association is something filmmakers love to do because it gets their bias across and they can always use the cop-out, Well, he wasn't really a minster. All of this is just in the beginning. With Fonda starring in the movie, what did I expect? Along the way, we also get the typical Liberal messages about middle-America folks being phonies, etc. The other star of the movie, Lee Marvin, plays a drunken cowboy (Kid Shelleen) most of the time, someone who can barely stay on his horse. Okay, maybe I'm alone in this but I never found sloppy, pathetic drunks or Bible-bashing people funny, but I know Hollywood sure does.Revenge is the main theme of this comedy-western, and revenge movies almost always do well.

The film is also well made, well directed, and well shot. And, damn, Jane Fonda has the cinema's nicest behind, I think. I was also particularly disappointed in Lee Marvin. I love him as an actor, and his role here won him his only Academy Award nomination, and he won. It's quite obvious that he won the award for his collected earlier works, for which the Academy was far too cowardly to give him. Let's face it drunks aren't funny. I did giggle a bit at the shot of him and his horse sleeping against a wall, but that's about all. He also plays the evil gunslinger, as well, but this dual role is nothing but a gimmick. The man in the black hat is barely in the film. The film gets no mileage out of him, and the most he can do is impersonate Jack Palance from Shane.
