Its gaggle of actresses are second to none and turn out excellant performance, Joan Plowright in particular brings an irresistable sweetness to the role. People who have commented on the film so far seem to have neglected to mention the soundtrack which is beautiful and inspiring with a wonderful piano piece. Criticism that the film is too old fashioned or that the characters are unappealing and pompous seems to miss the point, the very charm of Hester (Maggie Smith in particular)is how she overcomes her snobbery at the end and realises how much Elsa (Cher, who in any other film would doubtless be misplaced but in this case fits the role like a glove) has done for the Scorpioni. In short the film is a relic of a gentler age and is simultaniously uplifting, upsetting and relaxing. I implore everyone to hunt down the soundtrack on CD to the ends of the earth if necissary.

A young, illegitimate boy who is rejected by hisfather (who is married to another) is raised by his secretary (JoanPlowright).  She is part of a group of English ex-pats living in life onvery fixed incomes in Florence on the eve of WWII.  Plowright'sother peers include Maggie Smith as the insufferably snobbishwidow of a consulate, who never  lets anyone forget her status. There's also Judi Dench, an artist, who is a gentle soul and an animal lover.  Lily Tomlin is an American who keeps a watchful eyeon the ladies at the danger comes closer to engulfing them all. And then there's Cher, the widow of a rich man who comes andgoes throughout Europe in search of good art and a good time.  Allthese women have come to love the young boy who is now about14 when the movie begins.  Cher, whose character is  Jewish isdamn near ruined by a scheming lover, and her life is in danger. The British contingent has been sent to close quarters in Siennawhere they are forced to live in close proximity to each other, asprisoners of war.  The war is nearly over with the Americansadvancing on Sienna.  The young man helps to arrange Cher'sescape and the woman stop bickering long enough to help theAmericans liberate Sienna and all ends happily.  Some have complained that Cher is terrible in this movie. Nonsense.  She's playing a head-strong, independent womanwho is in charge of her own life.  This is a variation of the sametheme she has worked as an actress, entertainer and personalityfor more than 40 years.  The final parting with the young boy istear-inducing.  Cher looks sensational and gives a heart-feltperformance.  The ladies--Dames Joan, Maggie and Judi areadorable and winning as expected with Lily Tomlin offering awonderful portrait of a tough journalist who comes to their supportwhen the going gets rough.  The young boy as Zeffirelli is alsoterrific.  The scenery is gorgeous, and you can't see too manystories about interesting, off-beat characters on the loose in Italyas far as I'm concerned.

It tells you that the greatest evil is the work of humans, and that the potential for evil lurks in the human soul. But, and here is the movie greatest strength, it shows you that humans possess the capacity to be human and to act human, when they heed Shakespeare's advice Love thyself last.

It is probably the best performance I have seen by Maggie Smith, who often seems to be playing the same character actually. But this is her best since Miss Jean Brodie, and Joan Plowright, Judi Dench, Lily Tomlin and Cher are all equally impressive.The settings are skilfully designed to draw the viewer in, and when you are setting your movie in Florence and its environs you can't go wrong anyway. The ongoing clash between two worlds i.e. Lady Hester Random (Maggie Smith) versus Elsa (Cher) reaches a satisfying resolution which it would be unfair to reveal.There are splendid comic vignettes mixed into the overall drama. Judi Dench and her dog being thrown out of the cathedral, sharply contrasts with the chilling moment when the Jewish arts professor is taken away by the Gestapo. Understated but none the less effective, probably more so, because of it.If you haven't seen this film, see it as soon as you can.

Even presuming this is just a riff off an incident in his life, that he had some contact with memorable English ladies, it's clearly his tribute to where his love of English literature comes from, particularly Shakespeare. He's done several Shakespeare interpretations-- movies, opera and play directing. The film has a lovely scene of him being first introduced to acting out Romeo & Juliet with puppets, as well as constant quotes from Shakespeare throughout about war and his situation. I was surprised how good the movie was - I was in tears several times, especially with visuals that bring up the same comparisons as The Train did, with art vs. war, humanity's heights of creativity vs. its lows of prejudice and violence.These Oscar-winning ladies are absolutely terrific, yes including Cher. One elderly gentleman behind me complained that Maggie Smith basically always plays the same character but I thought her character does change towards the end. The others were certainly not their usual on-screen personas, Judi Dench as a free-spirited artist, Joan Plowright as a quite warm-hearted grandmotherly type, and Lily Tomlin a hoot as a butch archaeologist.But why choose bland Italian actors for them to play off of? To make the Scorpioni, as they are called, stand out more? The Italians seemed stereotyped to me, Latin lover, ignorant peasants not appreciating their ancient artistic heritage.What the movie also brought to mind is how few Italian movies have dealt with their fascist past as much as the French have been exploring their consciences of collaboration in film. Sure Garden of Finzi Continis, Two Women and Life Is Beautiful show arrests, etc. but I don't get the sense of soul searching as to how did this happen here and could it again? Just because they didn't have Shakespeare and appreciate the treasures of the Uffizi as this film implies?

However, true in part, true completely, in the end it doesn't really matter. What matters is the amazing ensemble acting by Maggie Smith, Cher, Joan Plowwright, Judi Dench and Lily Tomlin (listing them in the order of significance to the story) and the stunning beauty of Florence where the film is set. The director and photographer plainly love the city, matching the love for it of the characters. Maggie Smith as the widow of a former British ambassador, the character that actually has tea with Mussolini, is the dominant figure in the film. However, Cher, playing a wealthy American -- vulgar in the eyes of he British ladies -- who turns out to be a complex, philanthropic Jew who must be smuggled out of the country in the end; Joan Plowwright as a kind lady who takes in the bastard son of an Italian businessman and teaches him to be an English gentleman; Judi Dench as an eccentric artist whose passion is to preserve a renaissance fresco from the Nazis during the war, and Lily Tomlin as a lesbian American archaeologist all deliver sterling performances. Cher's performance is the most amazing -- she holds her own in formidable company -- but one expects, of course, to be dazzled by Maggie Smith, Joan Plowwright, Judi Dench and even by Lily Tomlin. It's a sentimental, even melodramatic, tale, but see it for the ensemble acting. I can't think of another film that equals Tea with Mussolini in that respect.

The second question is that the women in the film chose to ignore the reality of the brutality and evil of the regime of Hitler and Mussolini in favour of what they wanted to believe and to do.

In 1999 she made a tremendous comeback with a multimillion selling CD Believe(Warner Bros, 1998) and most impressively returned to the big screen with a luminous performance in Franco Zefferelli's Tea With Mussolini(MGM,1999). Reviews were mixed but after I saw this in the movie theater, I felt the film was rather good. Based on an autobiography by Zefferelli recounting his early years trying to survive the Nazi-Mussolini atrocities of WWII. During this dangerous time Zefferelli was protected by a coterie of socialite dowagers played splendidly by Maggie Smith, Judi Dench, Joan Plowright, Lily Tomlin and of course Cher who was perfectly cast as a gorgeous Jewish chanteuse. The story has some holes and the film was probably edited down too much for its US release that cause some continuity issues but this is overall a charming, thoughtful period piece highlighted by Cher at her latter day peak. Shame this success did not resuscitate her dormant film career. She has made nothing of note since. "}{"Title":"I love this movie.

World War II's effects on those lucky enough to be outside the camps of Germany, Russia, etc., were not as tragic, but poignant, nonetheless.

"},{"Title":"Tea with Charm, Elegance, Nostalgia, Affection and Decent Entertainment","Date":"7 October 2007","Score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Comedy, War","Review":" Tuscany, 1935, a group of ladies walk along the streets of the city deservedly considered one of the world's art pearls, Florence. We don't know the ladies at first but, in time, we find them intelligent women who perfectly understand English but hardly understand orders. These are Scorpioni, elderly English women who will play a decisive role in the story as well as in the life of a young boy, Luca, strikingly similar to the director himself in his youthful years, Franco Zeffirelli...Zeffirelli's autobiographical movie TEA WITH MUSSOLINI is a charming sentimental piece of work the action of which takes place in the Italy of the 1930s and 1940s the hardest period not only in the lives of those many who were living then but for the entire 20th century history, when, as many readers will probably agree with me, humanity seemed to be conquered by infernal ideologies and bestial hatred. Yet, according to what Zeffirelli shows us in the movie, even in those darkest days, there was also room for beauty protection, care, art admiration and mutual help. As a Zeffirelli's fan, I consider TEA WITH MUSSOLINI one of the director's best films. But not because it only shows how bad war was. That is something most of us already know well. I love the film for other reasons. I like it because......there are moments when you will cry, when you will think and when you will genuinely laugh. A proper balance of emotions supplied by the director makes the movie a very decent entertainment filled with affection, sorrow, even nostalgia but also fun, charm and comfort. Who can possibly skip the scene of football match, for instance? I also laughed openly at the moment the ladies teach the soldiers saying Good night. Isn't that a useful way to teach good manners and a foreign language at the same time? The moving moment in the orphanage will leave your eyes teary and the words of Ms Wallace about our contact with dead people may put you to nostalgia. But not for long. This fact of the film's heart goes in pairs with brilliant musical score Zeffirelli is famous for in his movies galore. What depth is there in this music and what supply of positive emotions! ...there are, except for variety of moments, beautiful Tuscan landscapes which make the movie a true postcard from Florence, San Gimignano and a true promotion of the Florentine art. This is also in accordance with the soul that Zeffirelli is so deeply attached to. The colorful hills around San Gimignano and the unique flowers under the Tuscany's sun leave hardly anyone indifferent. Consider, for instance, Luca's introduction of San Gimignano while he follows the bus with the ladies....there are foremost genuinely flawless performances that have to be linked to the deep development of characters. That is the aspect I'd like to pay more attention to in my comment. The ladies who occur to be at the focus are unforgettable. They supply the partly Italian movie with the truly English spirit. Maggie Smith does a wonderful job as Lady Hester elegant, well mannered but also naive in her confidence in Mussolini and reluctant of Americans, the lady who drinks the spectacular but tragic tea with the duce. Judi Dench is memorable as Arabella who has drunk the wine of Florence, warmed her hands with the fire of Boticelli and Michelangelo and wants to share this inner experience with other people. Joan Plowright is, as usual, genuine and unforgettable. She fits to particular roles and although she has carried some other brilliant roles in latest Zeffirelli movies, Ms Mary Wallace seems to be the character for her. Joan portrays a warm hearted lady who is not only a good cook introducing Luca to bacon with eggs but also a great intellectual so much in love with Shakespeare. Cher representing the American side is also very appealing as Elsa - a luxurious woman with a flair for paintings, a Picasso connoisseur whose cup of tea is not only modern art but also good heart. She once helped Luca and the time will come for her to be helped in the spirit of Shakespeare Love thyself less... Through these different characters, Zeffirelli appears to present the wonder of diversity in human beings. The two seemingly contradictory characters, Elsa and Lady Hester, seem to be of totally opposite natures. Yet, even they turn out to have something in common... Finally a mention must be made of Baird Wallace who perfectly portrays Luca as a youngster and Charlie Lucas as Luca a little boy. Great young talents! There is, finally, a great message of the film that war cannot ruin the world, that the power of spirit is endless, that real art is born in the deep of one's heart. The final scene when Arabella says at the remained fresco of Santa Fina Funeral Let Her sleep seems to symbolize an eternal human quest for the sublime and the mysterious presence. If the presence is there, we shouldn't have anything to worry about. The horror of war is ceased and the historic sounds of San Gimignano bells ringing out joyfully together with the director's message proclaim the reconciliation and peace. The twin towers stand as silent witnesses...Franco Zeffirelli, we should indeed appreciate art since it is the art that may bring out the genius of mankind.

Whereas Hollywood overstates, Europe understates. The story is based on the autobiography of Franco Zeffirelli, born in 1922, who became a prominent Italian stage director and achieved world fame as a director of filmed stage pieces such as Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, and La Traviata. The film deals with the years 1935-44. After the death of his mother Zeffirelli, or Luca in the film, an illegitimate child more or less rejected by his father, was looked after by a group of eccentric art-loving English ladies who had made Florence their home - on their terms. The locals call them the Scorpioni - a tribute to their acid tongues. When Mussolini declared war on Britain in 1940, the ladies were interned in a beautiful mountaintop village near Florence, guarded by a couple of long-suffering policeman, their lifestyle of sketching, painting, art appreciation and fine dining scarcely changing.The setting is the Florentine treasure troves of Tuscan art, the Uffizi, Il Duomo and the Academy. The English are led by three grand dames of the theatre, Joan Plowright as Arabella, Luca's chief protector, Maggie Smith, and Judy Dench (with her real life husband Michael Williams in a supporting role as the British consul.). Then there are two equally larger than life Americans, a retired but still glamorous movie star played by Cher, and a bike-riding lesbian  archaeologist played by Lily Tomlin. Most of the Italian characters are overshadowed by all this Anglo ego. (Or maybe it's just poor dubbing, or John Mortimer's part in the scriptwriting). The two boys playing Luca  at different ages are good looking but the older one in particular is a bit vacuous, and Cher's impossibly handsome Italian boyfriend puts in a wooden performance.There are a couple of plot-lines (will Cher escape the Jewish round-up, will the ladies make it through the war OK) and the occasional funny scene but the interest is really in the characters. Not that all of them are particularly attractive people. Maggie Smith's Lady Hester, widow of a former British Ambassador to Italy, is a dreadful old snob with hardly any brains who likes the fascists and has scarcely a good word for anybody else except her late husband. She engineers the tea party with Il Duce, fondly imagining that Mussolini himself will ensure the ladies' safety in Florence. A few days later the local fascists tip them out of the Uffizi gallery where they were accustomed to take tea while they sketched the old masters. Yet at the end she does show a little genuine good grace when she intervenes to help Cher.It's a curious piece, reminiscent of Life is Beautiful - a light comedy with a deadly serious titanic struggle between good and evil going on in the background, a background which seems altogether too gorgeous to accommodate such evil. Good, represented by a Scottish major, triumphs in the end, only to be put in his place by the Scorpioni. Zeffirelli here pays his artistic and personal debt to them. Wacky though they were, the Scorpioni did know the difference between good and evil, or at least the difference between good art and bad art, and they taught Zeffirelli well.

He co-wrote it with the English writer John Mortimer. It begins in Italy in 1935 at Elizabeth Barret Browning's grave - a symbol which bonds England and Italy. The English expatriates are represented by Judi Dench, Joan Plowright and a compelling Maggie Smith (winning the 1999 Bafta for Best Supporting Actress). Plowright is secretary to an Italian businessman who wants his young son Lucca to grow up to be a proper English gent - so Plowright teaches him Shakespeare and feeds him bacon and eggs. Then the rise of fascism means Lucca must be sent off to Austria. There follows a quite touching scene where the English ladies say goodbye by reciting the St Crispin Day's speech from Henry V at the railway station.The remainder of the drama follows the ladies' fortunes under the dictatorship of Mussolini. Smith's character, Lady Hester, is the widow of a former British ambassador, and does indeed take afternoon tea with Il Duce. The English ladies end up being in-turned but their Englishness remains defiant. During the Allied invasion of Italy, they are liberated by a Scottish regiment. Lady Hester declares The Germans and the Italians couldn't get rid of us, so there's no reason why we should surrender to the Scots.

Franco Zeffirelli's autobiographical film of his youth spent amongst the English Scorpioni in Florence before and during WWII is a very heartfelt piece of work. In the hands of three British ex-pats (Maggie Smith, Judi Dench, and Joan Plowright), young Luca is raised to appreciate art and life...and to tolerate A LOT! Also in the mix is Cher, as an American showgirl/benefactor with the exhaustive name of Elsa Morganthal Strauss-Armistan, and Lily Tomlin as a free-spirited archaeologist. The acting by all is exceptional, with Plowright a real standout as the Earth mother of the group. Cher has the longest name, but the briefest role. It does, however, turn out to be very pivotal. Dench is very funny as a ditsy culture vulture and Smith is perfect as the uptight (self appointed) leader of the den. Zeffirelli's script (co-written by John Mortimer) is funny (is there really a tea with Il Duce?), suspenseful, and even a little scary. This is the director's finest film in years.

In Tea with Mussolini, not only does he present his genius at directing, but he manages to use a score of what must have been a maven of egos with the assembled cast. Apparently he's good at this as well. This ensemble of actors would make ANY film worth seeing. Set in Italy (primarily in Florence), this bio-pic captures the eternal beauty of the country yet at the same time presents the macabre, the unacceptable, the dis-ingenuousness of the political system (Mussolini--what more needs to be said in terms of relegating him to ogre status, the little creep!).It is 1935 when we meet the ladies (the Scorpioni, they're called, because they bit, Lily Tomlin says.

I have to agree on many of those weaknesses, although I have a talent for suspending my disbelief in order to appreciate some finer qualities of a movie.  This didn't receive a very high rating from me, however, I have stringent guidelines.  I do think it is worth seeing merely because it does a good job of showing us a different perspective.  For our generation to look back into history and judge those who were naive as doing nothing to stop the atrocities...  I do not make excuses for those who saw the horror with their own eyes and turned away, or worse, gave up their neighbors...  But for example, in this movie, when the local military knocks the town around a bit, some of the fine British believed it to be an isolated incident and just didn't believe that Jews were really being rounded up and carted away like livestock elsewhere.  They trusted the word of Mussolini and believed in the greater good of the governments and aristocracy of the time.This is a touchy subject, but in our age of media coverage, even I doubted the stories I read in the paper of the atrocities in eastern Europe and thought it may be propaganda and overblown.  I just couldn't believe it what was happening in our modern times and in Europe.  This disbelief was coming from an educated person (in political science, no less) who knows a bit of history.  I still could not believe that was happening, until I saw the pictures of the refugee camps and the burned out homes with my own eyes, and finally, until I shared a flat with a man whose parents and child were driven from their homes.  I can fully believe that some Europeans at that time, would not see the big picture to stop Hitler and his cronies until it was all too late.  It frightens me, even to see how easy it happened. It is worth seeing this movie just to understand the perspective of how quietly and quickly the Nazi/fascists did what they did.

Tea With Mussolini is one such effort.Set in Florence during the second world war, the story revolves around an Italian orphan named Luca who is taken in by a a group of elderly British ladies.  Complete with their homespun customs which includes high tea and staunch manners, these ladies set about instilling in Luca the passion that they have for his art-filled city.  They remain oblivious to the war that is brewing around them, and in fact the ring leader of the group, Lady Chester (played wonderfully by Maggie Smith) has tea with the dictator, getting his assurances that these British nobles will remain safe. Cher plays the much despised American, Elsa, who spends her rich husband's money on art and other lavish objects.  Her personal connection to Luca, (his mother made clothes for her) creates a connection to her and the others.  The women are eventually interned and this becomes a coming of age story for Luca as well as for the women.  Ignore the fact that the story tends to drag just a tad.  Tea With Mussolini is a period piece, complete with gorgeous settings and great costumes.  Furthermore, it is an opportunity to see several actresses strut their stuff with a script filled with some brilliant lines.  Maggie Smith stands out, flaunting her British airs at every opportunity.  All the great people have empires these days.  Her visit with Mussolini is a classic scene and she milks it for all its worth.  In fact this is Smith's best work in several years.  Cher over does her part as the flamboyant rich girl.  She sports some great outfits but its sometimes hard to believe that she  is the spoiled American princess with a heart of gold that Elsa is supposed to be.  Cher does sing at one point (and what a campy moment that was) and of course she does look the part.Judi Dench was a bit of a let down playing the sentimental artist.  She wasn't bad in the role, but after seeing her play some tough queens in her recent past, seeing her here playing a wimp is a bit of a challenge.  Joan Plowright and Lily Tomlin are both passable in their roles, but again, I felt their talents a little wasted here.  Tea With Mussolini is worth at least one viewing.  Fans of Cher and Maggie Smith will not be disappointed. The city of Florence is certainly showcased well, as are the actresses.  Perhaps the thin plot line was a result of someone trying to find something for all of these women to do.     "},{"Title":"Heartwarming!

I enjoyed Lily Tomlin's performance very much and Cher didn't ruin the movie for me (she did for my husband) though I couldn't help noticing how much less expressive her nipped & tucked features were, compared to the beauty of Judi, Joan & Maggie.

No, this isn't the Saving Private Ryan look at WWII, but surely there's room for different perspectives & I don't think looking at them - and laughing at them - in ANY way diminishes the importance of the lives sacrificed in a war. On the contrary, it enriches our understanding of the horrors of war to see the power of the human spirit, like we also saw in Life is Beautiful, and to get a glimpse of some of the ways of life that the war threatened to or did destroy - however trivial they may seem.It's sad to read how many users seemed to be saying Why should we care what happens to a bunch of snotty old ladies. I'd suggest that they do a little research and stick to the plethora of movies about over-sexed 17-year-olds. God knows, there are enough of them.

At first you think another CINEMA PARADISO or LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL as we enter the eyes of a young boy, Luca, in the sweet serenity of Florence from 1934 to 1945. Surrounding him are a bunch of some eccentric and snobbish elderly women from England. To add further spice we have two Yankee women, the loud obnoxious and very rich Elsa, (Cher hamming it up) and the lesbian Georgi, (another fine performance from Lily). They claim Florence as their home and who wouldn't with an overabundance of romance, art and pasta. But along come the Fascist Black Shirts as they disrupt the tea party for our ladies and round them up as prisoners of war. To the rescue comes Luca, now grown up with testosterone levels to burn. All this, believe it or not, is based on director Zeffirelli's memoirs. I wonder if back then he had an orchestra following him around playing the emotional manipulative music? When Zeffirelli goes for the wide shots he is safe because of the beautiful scenery and set designs. It is when he orchestrates a dialogue driven scene that he falls flat on his face, giving us disjointed cuts and too much time on the leadi ng actresses, (mostly Cher), instead of telling a story in where the emotions are aimed. Working your way through this film gets a little clumsy but emotionally you understand where its heart lays.

The interiors too really sparkle - a great compliment to the art director.  The superb cast ( mainly women ) give wonderful individual performances as Britishers uprooted from their beloved homeland, annoyed and irritated by the upheaval of war in Mussolini's Italy.  Lady Hester Random (Maggie Smith) and Arabella (Judi Dench) portray English aristocratic snobs completely out of their depth in their alien surroundings, ever critical of the rich and beautiful Elsa (played by Cher to perfection) and everything else American.  One of them remarks about Americans in general They even vulgarize ice-cream. (This I think is one of the funniest lines in the script).  Mary Wallace (Joan Plowright) is a warm-hearted woman who befriends and cares for Luca the child of a broken Italian marriage. Their love and respect for each other is beautifully portrayed.  Mussolini (Claudio Spadano) is unmistakeably the fascist leader who fails to keep his promise to protect the ladies and struts about in typical fashion. Despite the foregoing, the remarkable performances add up to something less than perfect. The film just misses out somewhere. Is it the script? Luca delivering messages on his bicycle in the dead of night and the screaming British women running riot and struggling with the army offices for the most part are unconvincing.  But this is a comedy drama and should not be taken too seriously.  Quite good as light entertainment.

The filmmaker has chosen for his subject a rather unique social milieu - a group of staid elderly British women living in relative luxury in pre-war Florence who suffer mild persecution at the hands of the Fascists when all English citizens are officially declared enemies of the Italian people.  The key phrase here is mild persecution, for one of the weaknesses of the film is that it establishes too genteel a tone for the subject matter. Such a tone may be befitting, a group of snooty British dames, but the suggestion of good old stiff-upper-lipped British stalwartness triumphing over Fascist brutality seems a bit contrary to the history of the times. These women seem rarely to be in any real personal danger at the hands of the rather mildmannered fascists who guard them and even the hairbreadth escapes some of them must undergo are achieved with surprising ease and very little strain or difficulty.Zeffirelli's multi-character canvas provides a rich opportunity for a number of fine actresses to shine.  Maggie Smith invests the stereotypical role of elite British snob with her usual subtlety and humanity.  As the wife of a late British ambassador to Italy, she spearheads this group of rootless English ladies, maintaining all the stuffy rituals of high class British manners in the face of not only Fascist hooligans bent on routing them from their Italian soil but a couple of gauche Americans who invade the ladies' realm.  These include Cher as a flighty art patron and Lily Tomlin as a lesbian archaeologist, two performers whose aggressive acting styles and overstated Americanisms provide far too incongruous an image in the context of this film.  Zeffirelli draws the Anglo/American distinction in such a heavyhanded fashion that the film often seems to come apart at the seams. In addition, the narrative spins off into so many different directions at times that it dilutes its own power and effectiveness.  The boy, modeled after Zeffirelli himself, who is raised by a kind member of the group, fails to register as an engaging, fully developed character in his own right.  In the beginning, his plight as an unwanted bastard and Joan Plowright's compassionate adoption of him register deeply with the viewer on a strong emotional level.  However, as the child grows up, he becomes essentially a blank as a character and his puppy love crush on Cher functions as more of a distraction than anything else.   Plowright, however, provides the real human focus of the story, and it is the utter selflessness and strongwilled righteousness of her character that makes the deepest mark on the viewer.Tea With Mussolini deserves credit for portraying a world not often seen in the movies and the film is not without its moments of poignancy, facscination and even occasional humor.  Somehow, though, the film seems to endorse many of the stuffy values and naive ideals that the very concept of taking tea with Mussolini seems to embody - a view of the world and of history that sugarcoats their most decidedly unpleasant aspects and allows us to pretend that real world brutality can be overcome by the sheer force of good manners. "},{"Title":"A Good Movie With Just a Little Bit Missing. *** out of ****","Date":"14 June 1999","Score":"7 out of 13 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Comedy, War","Review":"  Tea With Mussolini is a good movie with just a little bit missing. There isn't a major flaw present, nor is there any outright bad filmmaking. The film itself has a lot of colorful characters, gentle subplots, twisted dialogue and emotional depth. What it is lacking is just about everything else. The story is said to be a nugget out of the life of writer director FrancoZeffirelli, who in the mid 1930s and the early 1940s in Florence, is replaced with a young boy named Luca who is being raised in as an orphan. He doesn't know, but his mother is dead, and his father is married to another woman and doesn't give a bag of bones about his rightful him.There we have it, the first act of the movie. Just a few scenes. Just a few minutes. We meet the characters and discover the problem Luca has no one. The message so simple and sweet, thus it is almost a shame that the second act begins immediately with the solution The boy's father's secretary, Mary Wallace, decides to adopt him. She is part of an eccentric community of British refugees called the Scorpioni, who sip tea and take part in Italy's wonders. The team includes Arabella (Judi Dench), Georgie (Lily Tomlin), Mary (Joan Plowright) and is led by the snotty Hester (Maggie Smith), whose late husband was England's ambassador to Italy, working with the dictator Mussolini. The boy becomes indulged into the group making many life long friends.A subplot in the film deals with Hester's hostility against Elsa (Cher), a rich American art collected providing help for the Scorpioni and Luca's future, sharing the same interests as the ladies.As the war grows more and more powerful, and when Italy enters the side of Germany,  the English are classified as enemies who must be strung together into a small shelter to be held for the duration of the war.The plot gets more and more complicated, to the point of feeling a sense of a false second act. But after analyzing the movie a little more in depth, I observe it's structure is nothing more than the cunningly common three act formula. There are several stories in one here, making the movie's structure deceiving.The performances are pretty good. Cher especially does well with another perfectly casted character worthy of a nomination for best supporting actress. Judi Dench, Joan Plowright, Maggie Smith and Lily Tomlin form the perfect team the old ladies' club, all delivering top notch performances. A further nice touch to the film's credit goes to the amazingly realistic aging process of Luca, from young boy to teenager, the resemblance of the actors (Charlie Lucas and Baird Wallace)make this an emotional journey easy to buy into.I suppose that within the boundaries the filmmakers do a good job of giving us variety, but the boundaries are too strict here. I felt like that seeing the glamorous Italian scenery and a bunch of elders enjoying life wasn't exactly enough to hold interest for the running length, which is almost two hours. True, the characters provided an interesting prospective of life in Italy in the 1930s, but even they couldn't hold the movie together for two hours.I liked Tea With Mussolini, but I am sure many audiences will not. The movie is soapy and historical (one of the better period film's to come down the road in some time, may I add), the thematic elements may though some off, and there isn't a whole lot of relevance in the film either. Not a great production by any means, but Tea With Mussolini does end up coming off as a marginally passable journey into the heart of Italy in the 1930s.

Even the men of Mussolini's fascist Italy find this out as they try to toss the English out on their ear and find that, like France's Madame DeFarge did with England's Miss Pross, that I am an English woman! I am your match!.It all begins in peacetime as a British ambassador's widow (Smith) holds court while subtle hints of fascism are rising around them. The snooty dowager has no place at her society teas for Cher, but she's going to have to change her mind as the world begins to crash around them and the British society she has known refuses to stand up and leave even though their lives are at stake. More gentle are Ms. Dench and Ms. Plowright, artistic types who take interest in a young orphan, a bastard not wanted by his biological father, and publicly humiliated by the father's wife. Cher, a friend of his mother's, arranges for him to get a trust fund, and after his father sends him off to Germany for a fascist education, the English women return to their lives as they prepare to fight their own battle with Mussolini. Dame Maggie is the one of the group who has Tea With Mussolini, promised peace and protection by him, a promise he surely won't keep.The episodic feel of the film shows up as the years flash by on screen, and the boy returns as a young man with the intentions of helping the women survive their imprisonment in an abandoned Italian castle. He discovers that Cher has been betrayed by her lover, and with the help of Smith's grandson (whom she has been disguising in women's clothes for years), arranges to help Cher escape. A lot happens in two hours, but with these divas, it speeds by, especially with Smith's dry sarcasm, Dench and Plowright's warmth, Tomlin's masculine energy, and Cher's Auntie Mame like diva. Cher is the only one who seems (only slightly) out of her comfort zone. Period pieces don't seem to suit her, and when she breaks into a chorus of Smoke Gets In Your Eyes, it seems like a moment of desperation.In spite of all that, this is a very likable film, and there are some light-hearted moments included inside one of the most tragic times in our recent history where freedom was threatened on every level. Thanks to a fast-paced direction and lavish sets and beautiful countrysides, Tea With Mussolini is a winning drama that might not be perfect but one that its audience will find things to admire. In the end, this is more about the women who really have nothing at all in common but the need to survive and the realization that they cannot do it alone.

Director Franco Zeffirelli (Brother Sun, Sister Moon 1972) was at his twilight time when shot this film (he was 76 then), which undeniably means there is scare chance that any director could launch another career apex (late bloomers are not included). Firstly for any film aficionados, the vintage cast consists of Cher, Maggie, Judi, Joan and Lily has an irresistible allure which only indicates that it will not dash my hope of an enchanting 2-hour stretch. The film gets Cher plays herself, divine and vulnerable at the same time, although I don't buy it when she would make such a rash and unexplained mistake in the latter story, maybe Paolo Seganti is too hot to resist (who knows, he is killingly delicious here). My favorite performance here is Dame Maggie Smith, whose acute spinster character is again fun to watch, alongside her old confidante Dame Judi Dench, a more vivacious image as Arabella, the art guardian. Joan Plowright's part is a heartrending one and Lily Tomlin's lesbian fashion could never be better for her. After all, this is a biographic story of Zeffirelli himself and our protagonist is Luca, whose adolescent ceremony co-occurs with WWII, which profoundly affects those expatriate ladies. This is a substantially feel-good film, and I must say I did enjoy the film, Zeffirelli failed to keep the balance to not reveal his conspicuous contrivances of bolstering the emotional momentum, so it leaves me some artificial impulse to discern some biased point-of-view about British chauvinism and American flattery, anyway, nothing to do with Italians, eventually.

The message of this movie, it seems to me, is far from trite or cliched, far from popular or instantly acceptable, whether we apply it to pre-WWII Italy or the present day.  The young boy, Luca, has the misfortune to lose his father, the fortune to gain a gaggle of fairy godmothers who inculcate the virtues of civility, humaneness, love of literature and art, tolerance of what's now called diversity (and might then have been called eccentricity), and above all, the notion of fidelity in love.  As Thomas Mann (among others) recognized, the education of the artist requires the coaxing forth of the feminine side of oneself, whether one is male or female.  The object (as in the case of the young man Wilfrid) is not to submerge one's masculinity, but to bring it into balance or alignment with the feminine virtues, for the highest, most fully human art must by definition be androgynous.  All this is communicated with the lightest possible touch by Franco Zeffirelli, who acknowledges at the end that young Luca's story is based on his own.

It essentially charts the nobility of character and strength of will of a group of British and American ladies in both pre-war and wartime Italy, their interaction with one another and with the society in which they find themselves. The potential for the film to be either dull or over-dramatic is consistently thwarted by the tight hold on emotions exhibited by the British women in particular and by the pervasive humour of the script. My two difficulties with the movie are firstly, its uncertain point of view. At times the point of view seems clearly to be that of the Italian boy 'adopted' by this community of gentlewomen - but then for periods this is clearly not the case. Finally, I felt that the 'what they did next' endlines were totally inconsistent with the movie and it would have been far more effective to leave this to the viewer's imagination.

The child, Luca, is Zeffirelli. Luca is being raised by an English lady, Mary Wallace (Lady Joan Plowright) who teaches him Shakespeare and right from wrong. Luca's mother, a dressmaker, has died and his 'illegitimate father' is married and wants little to do with Luca. Mary is one of a group of five foreigh ladies living permanently in Florence, Italy. Lady Hester Ransom (Dame Maggie Smith) is the widow of a former British ambassador to Italy. She is extremely self-centred and haughty and is a great admirer of Mussolini, who is the same. When the fascists start taking their nationalism into the streets, she visits Mussolini and is assured that they will all be safe; she is naúve enough to believe him. Arabella (Dame Judi Dench) is a flighty saviour of Italian art, which she feels is being neglected. These three are English but there are two Americans Georgie Rockwell (Lily Tomlin) an archaeologist and Elsa Morgenthal (Cher) a wealthy Jewish art collector. The film takes them through their halcyon days and their imprisonment as enemy aliens. Luca, being Italian, is free and is able to assist them from the outside. Elsa, being very wealthy is able to ameliorate their incarceration. The film tells an interesting story about interesting people. The dialogue appears a little trite at times but perhaps that is simply how we feel, nowadays, about the speech and thoughts of the 1930s.

When dealing with such a subject, a film-maker has a duty to history be truthful. He may choose to focus on a small part of that history, and this Zeferelli does, but he is nevertheless required to be honest. As I watched this story develop, I became increasingly to feel that history was being re-written.The yarn concerns a gaggle of middle-aged British women, lost in the art and poetry of Florence as Mussonlini's fascists herald in a new era for Europe. An adopted Italian boy and obligatory feisty Yanks are stirred into the mix, for colour, presumably. The war kicks in and the ladies are interned. Not for them, fortunately, the real horrors of fascist detention - they find themselves in a splendid Tuscan village with plenty of frescoes to restore.In describing the ladies' predicament as the war develops, the film tells an interesting story. However, where I found it to be dishonest was in its peripheral sub-plots. In one such story, a young British lad has been living under the pretence of being a girl so he can remain with his grand-mother. He finally cracks, strips off his clothes and rushes outside screaming, I am a man!. In reality, he would have been summarily shot by the guards. Instead, he immediately meets a group of partisans and very soon, has become a resistance fighter.In another scene, the Germans are threatening to dynamite an ancient tower for no obvious military purpose. The ladies tie themselves to the building in defiance. Are they shot? do the Germans blow the building anyway? Of course not, exasperated, they retreat.Yet again, Cher's character is being rescued by the partisans and is led the the shore where a fishing boat will take you to safety. How is this supposed to be? All land for a thousand miles is occupied Nazi territory.The final irony comes at the end of the movie as victorious Brits enter the town atop their tanks. The Italian crowd rejoice waving flags and generally behaving like liberated French.This portrayal of Italy as somehow similar to occupied France is very worrying. Italy was a willing member of the Axis powers and as such must accept responsibility for the terrors inflicted by those powers. As for the partisans, whatever anti-fascists there were, they were ineffectual and prevalent only in the South of Italy. And why are only German troops opposing the advancing Allies? In the whole movie, the Italian army is never seen to fight anyone.I would have appreciated a more adult movie, which accepted Italy's fascist past and let us all, Italians included, muse on how a people that have brought us the wonders of the Renaissance could also produce the nightmare of Nazism.

If you want to see a star there is Cher in her inimitable style. If you want to see a fine cast of well-honed real actors and actresses you have a fine selection of British stage and screen talent of many years standing. If you want a bit of comedy, Lily Tomlin hams it up relentlessly. If you want a gentle and well-humoured tale of eccentrics in their own little world that only occasionally stretches your credulity, it's there for the taking. And a dozen little strands and subplots and messages. And beautiful cinematography, almost to the point of being a travelogue.If you want an endlessly convoluted plot or lots of action; look elsewhere. And that perhaps is the point; this is a restrained film. There is nothing done to excess (although I would have cheerfully shot Maggie Smith's insufferable character!)

It's happy to meander through one of the most intense times of the twentieth century, and for the most part fails to summon up much passion -- positive or negative.If the story is pointless, the focus on the characters is, for better or worse, much sharper. The main character is Luca (Baird Wallace), a semi-autobiographical figure for Zeffirelli. The illegitimate son of a vain, promiscuous businessman, Luca is befriended by a group of haughty English ladies whilst growing up in Florence in the 1930s and 40s. When World War Two breaks out, all stay in Italy -- some unable to leave, but the leader of the pack simply steadfast in a nonsensical determination that because she once drank tea with Mussolini, and her husband was a diplomat, no harm can come to any elderly Englishwomen.Upstaging the action at every turn is beautiful photography by David Watkin (Out of Africa), and good period re-creation, in the authentic costume design and well-chosen locations. Most of the time, that action isn't bad, merely uninteresting. If the film -- sunny and innocuous -- were intended as comedy, maybe I would have enjoyed it more, but in the way it's made, and at the pace to which the story unfolds, it comes across as a static drama with infrequent, spasmodic flashes of wit.The wit sometimes works -- the best moment in the film comes when a character sees a Knickerbocker Glory, only to say of Americans It's amazing... they can even vulgarise ice cream! The early drama plays well, too, with touching illustration of Luca's hard times as a child. Occasionally, however, I became very annoyed. Zeffirelli's deception and narcissism has real gall, in that a key plot point is Luca's active participation in the resistance movement, when the real Zeffirelli was never involved in any such thing. Nor did I particularly care for the old dears. Mary, the woman who takes young Luca under her wing, is written with depth and kindness, but played as weirdly and annoyingly as possible by Joan Plowright, who ruins yet another good role. Judi Dench's character is a mad scruff, whose short, quiet moments are always followed up by interminable fits of hysterical crying. Lady Hester (Maggie Smith) is a character of such idiocy and arrogance that I view her as simply evil.Outside this circle is a more refreshing female presence, flamboyant American playgirl Esta, portrayed in Oscar-worthy fashion by Cher. But she too is surrounded by irritating morons. One is a crass layabout, Georgie (Lily Tomlin), whose lesbianism is constantly being pointed out for no reason, and who dresses like no real human being I've ever seen. Another, the ineptly conceived reporter Connie (Tessa Pritchard), is a walking bag of ridiculous clichés from 30s screwball comedies.Most of these women are morally bankrupt snobs oblivious to their surroundings, and this is shown without apology. When the biddies cook up a storm at having to share a house together, or at enemy soldiers not saying Goodnight, ladies, the film seems to be on their side, unaware of the ludicrous audacity. This becomes most sickening when brave British soldiers travel from the front line to valiantly offer the women a safe haven, and are met with bitchy impudence. Some members of the audience laughed with pride -- I sank in my seat and thought how grateful the poor young lads in Saving Private Ryan would have been for such an offer.So unlike Chariots of Fire, which got me emotionally involved with people I'd normally run a mile from, Tea With Mussolini fails to humanise its priggish characters. And unlike the recent Oscar-winner Life is Beautiful, Zeffirelli's film does not carry much power in showing how spirits can be kept up even when the world seems to collapse. I'm aware that there are people like this. I don't want to spend two hours watching them.

These films always concern themselves over spilled milk and late tea service. These films also are incredibly frail.  While the cast is filled to brim with proven talent, Academy Award winners, and the reigning pop music diva, Zeffirelli cannot make the film resound with the audience at all. Like the current Midsummer Night's Dream, Tea is also set in the lush landscape of Italy.  Zeffirelli uses the vista well to amp the feeling of a fallen land as World War II creeps into the social fabric of the country.  When the film begins, it's a wonderful story about an abandoned boy who is taken in by a group of older women who decide to raise him together. As the film lumbers on, the war story begins to seep in and the film unravels at an alarming rate.  The aforementioned cast of legends seem very much in place as stuffy old English ladies.  Joan Plowright has an adorable face, but the film soon forgets her after she is introduced as the main character. Dame Judi Dench is given a paper thin role.  Lily Tomlin is actually acting again, but the lesbian overtones are a bit much. Maggie Smith takes the cake in a role she seems born to play, that of a frosty woman who constantly complains and demands the world.  And in a bit of old Hollywood star power, Cher delights in the role of the lone brash American - not a big stretch. It's the script that eventually undoes Tea.  It's a piece that's just too schizophrenic for it to be entertaining, and yet not informative enough to be educational. Zeffirelli clumsily handles the Mussolini scenes.  He makes the moments with the Italian dictator feel like the old Gerald Ford bits on Saturday Night Live. And coming after such films as Saving Private Ryan and Life Is Beautiful, the WWII story in Tea is way too mild and impersonal by comparison.----------- 4 "},{"Title":"Amusing at times, but not really well-done.","Date":"17 May 1999","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Comedy, War","Review":"  The performances by the actors in this film are outstanding, but it's just not complete.

And I have to say that perhaps this just isn't a film for my age bracket.  That may be a little unfair, but at the age of 27, I was easily the youngest in the theater.  And the older people seemed to be enjoying it just fine.  And I guess that's who the film is garnered towards.  I really hate to say this in a review of a film but to be quite honest, it was a bore.  To me there was nothing happening.  And at times I felt like I have seen this Cher movie before.  A foreign country has their own ways and traditions and they seem proper and stuffy and then the brash American woman comes onto the scene and turns everyones world upside down.  This seems to be the same character that Cher plays in every film.  Moonstruck, Mermaids and even Suspect.  Does this make her a good actress or is she just playing herself?  I'm not sure but I get tired of seeing her in the same role with a different name.  But like I said, that is just me.  Even the Forest Gumpization of it where it puts these ladies in a situation to talk to a famous world leader is quite silly and not as funny or insightful as it could have been.

The tone is affectionate, and the ladies are all played by leading British character actresses who give enthusiastic performances, although it's more fun to see Judi Dench cast against type as a free spirit than to watch Maggie Smith playing yet another harridan, however well she does it. But there's no especial subtlety in this movie, and some minor parts are played quite woodenly, especially both the young actors cast as Luca (the thinly disguised Zeffireli character, who the women bring up). And whereas the start of the film (set in the 1930s) is gripping because something terrible is about to happen, and no-one realises it (or chooses to realise it), the war scenes themselves come as something an an anti-climax these women are just too good at disregarding reality when it suits them to be at true risk of exposure to the wider horror. This obstinate insularity could be cast as a kind of moral blindness, but the film chooses not to explore such idea. Political comment is restricted to Smith's character's admiration for Mussolini; but as this character is not (in the beginning) sympathetic, this is an easy sacrifice for the film to make. The fascist cause managed to attract the support of many ordinary people; and also foreign politicians (even Churchill at one time applauded Il Duce); but one will not understand how that came to pass by watching this film.In the globalised modern world, the life of the expat takes on a different meaning, and what's best about 'Tea with Mussolini' is the charming way it portrays an obsolete mode of life. But it does so almost too successfully to capture the sense of a Europe first approaching, and then engaged in, the dreadful business of war.

It is supposedly from this period that Zeffirelli's love of Shakespeare stems.Whereas nothing much can be said against any of the fine dames - Mss. Judi Dench, Joan Plowright and Maggie Smith - leading the cast, one did not feel that there playing anything more than tongue-in-cheek bravado aplomb, which Cher's participation only served to accentuate or exaggerate. Such that one felt somewhat at a loss as to the sincerity of the whole operation, especially in the latter stages of the film's development. Most certainly the first half is better and with a more cohesive continuity, but this in the second half begins to break up, even fragment, into rather haphazard disjointed story-telling spread over lengthy periods of time clumsily strung together. It was certainly nice seeing those fine old actresses again, or even the oft surgically operated Cher, and indeed they afforded several interesting moments; but on the whole neither their efforts nor those of Zeffirelli himself add up to very much. The film left me wondering whether Zeffirelli was unsure as to his film being an all-out comedy or as to it trying to be a more serious drama. In the end it is not really one or the other but almost a pastiche of both without much conviction.

The screen buzzes into life as a group of eccentric English grandes dames under the leadership of the redoubtable Maggie Smith gather in a cemetery to celebrate the work of Elizabeth Browning.  A few minutes further on and it gets even better as that wonderful actress Joan Plowright explains her photos to a small Italian boy whom she has taken under her wing.  I choked back a tear at this point and settled down full of expectations of a good wallow in one of those great feel-good films such as Cinema Paradiso.  Some twenty minutes in the doubts began.  Where is this film going and why aren't the characters developing?  The answer to the first is that it doesn't know where, as Zeffirelli and his script writer, John Mortimer, cannot decide whether this is a wry look at stiff upperlip British eccentricity , an action film or a reconstruction of a small chapter of modern history.  The characters are unable to develop as, with the exception of Joan Plowright, the central group of women are treated as caricatures, none more so than the woefully miscast Judi Dench who runs all over the place gererally slobbering over her precious dog.  The English group number several more but we never get to know them as they are made to contribute little more than a chorus of assents when one of the grandes dames speaks.  Sometimes they raise their arms and look worried or bewildered.  They reminded me at times of the Townswomen's Guild's re-enactment of the Battle of Pearl Harbour of Monty Python fame.  Think of the depth with which Cynthia Scott invested every one of a similar group of elderly women in a similarly extreme situation in the Canadian The Company of Strangers and you realise how shallow Tea With Mussolini is. The arrival of a gatecrasher in the form of a wealthy younger American woman played by Cher is intended to add a degree of tension but it does little other than reinforce Maggie Smith's xenophobic prejudices.  The film attempts to say something about misguided trust, Maggie Smith's in Mussolini and Cher's in her Italian beau but by the end it has become too messy and unfocussed to say anything clearly.  The final shot of a religious painting in a church that has been saved from destruction is held for what seems like an eternity before the credits roll.  If this is an attempt to conclude the film significantly as Tarkovsky did in Andrei Rublev it fails miserably as, unlike the Russian masterwork it bears no relationship to what has gone before.

At this point the story focuses on a young boy named Luca who is abandoned by his only parent, a careless and inconsiderate father and is now an orphan. He is taken into custody by one of the English women, Ms. Wallace. Later the boy is sent to school in Austria which was provided by a close friend of his deceased mother, a wealthy American, Elsa Morganthal. During that time the general atmosphere is getting more and more intense and insecure. Specifically for these women for whom it is no longer safe to dwell in Italy, for they become so-called 'enemy aliens'. The story is quite diverse and it never becomes too messed up. Most of the characters are represented in a fair amount of time. Despite the unkind environment, the only grumbler here turns out to be one of the English women, Lady Hester Random. The one that had tea with Mussolini. It is funny how the film is titled, because the tea part is the least important event in the movie. What seems important here is how these women will get around their disagreements. The war really isn't that important because nobody actually loses anything that would have great value. No, they actually gain a few things, reunite and widen their friendships. What I like about the film is the smooth narrative style, which isn't the least gushy. Nothing special but it evolves the characters in a surprisingly even tempo.But the movie just isn't centered on something specific. You feel as if there isn't even a central character in the story. First I thought the main character would be Luca or Ms. Wallace. The movie isn't even that strong in describing the wartime atmosphere. The best part of it is the optimistic and kind look on life that these women seem to have.

The movie features beautiful Tuscan scenery, a background steeped in Florentine art treasures, appropriate period costumes, a dramatic wartime Italian setting, competent acting, and a sentimental personal story. However, for some reason it failed to live up to my expectations when I tuned in.The film depicts the semi biographical childhood tale of Italian director Franco Zeffirelli. Luca, the illegitimate son of a businessman disinterested in his offspring, is raised by his father's secretary and a group of British expatriot ladies living in pre fascist World War II Italy. These ladies enjoy idle days chit chatting, admiring the art of the old masters, and taking their four o'clock high tea at the Uffizzi, oblivious to the political and military storms brewing all around them. The women, all well past their prime, have come to genuinely love Luca, who progresses from a young boy to a teenager during the story. The Scorpionini, as these ladies come to be called for their biting tongues, prove to be quite naive, believing their safety to be guaranteed after tea is arranged with dictator Benito Mussolini. However, the British are eventually sent to Siena where they must live in close quarters and are more or less held as prisoners of war. These dames all have very disparate personalities, well portrayed by competent actresses. The group's leader is Lady Hester, Maggie Smith in her typical role as an insufferably snobbish English aristocrat. She constantly reminds the others that she is the wife of the former British ambassador to Italy, and she's the one who has in fact orchestrated the tea party with Il Duce hoping to ensure protection for these Britsh expatriots. Joan Plowright is Luca's chief guardian, Mary Wallace, the kind, grandmotherly secretary who has taken the young boy under her wing. Judi Dench portrays a free spirited artist (Arabella) and Lily Tomlin an American archaeologist (Georgie). As another noted, unnecessarily much is made of the fact that Georgie is a lesbian. For me, the star actress may actually be Cher, who plays a rich, independent, strong willed American Jewish widow named Elsa, who befriends these Britiah ladies while traveling about Europe seeking fine art and good times. Unfortunately this flamboyant character has a handsome but conniving Italian lover who ends up placing her in danger of execution.The women's bond with the orphaned Luca proves the most touching aspect of this tale. The movie does also depict how the genteel English ladies band with a pair of independent, modern American women to solve their wartime dilemmas. However, much of the time the dames are bickering and often seem just plain silly. I suppose that's intended as the point of the movie but a little of it went a long way, leaving me with something of a sense of disappointment in a story I had expected to love. It just wasn't quite the refreshing cup of tea I had anticipated.

Basically this is a semi-autobiographical tale based on the early experiences of director Zeffirelli, seeing the life of an Italian businessman's son. Luca (Charlie Lucas) grows up raised by Englishwoman Mary Wallace (Joan Plowright) after his mother dies, and they are living in Fascist Italy in Florence on the eve of World War II, along with other Englishwomen living sheltered in the country. These other women include Lady Hester Random (Dame Maggie Smith) and Arabella (Dame Judi Dench) who are hoping for assured protection after a tea reception with Mussolini (Claudio Spadaro), but the war breaks out and this does not happen. Luca (Baird Wallace) grows up, and occasionally visiting the women in the English colony is American wealthy socialite Elsa Morganthal Strauss-Armistan (Cher), and when they are low on luck and stuck in a bad living environment she secretly pays for their stay in a hotel. Lady Random, the ambassador's widow, dislikes Elsa, but she is part of the story too when America enters the war two years later, and there is some plot about signing over for modern art or something, and Georgie Rockwell (Lily Tomlin) gets involved too. Okay, I will be honest I did not understand much of the plot at all. Also starring Massimo Ghini as Paolo.

Her little scene with Maggie Smith is the best scene in this flick. But for the rest, my opinion remains the same. 'Tea with Mussolini' is a glossy, shallow, manipulative and empty movie with hollow pretensions about art. Judi Dench's artsy character is completely ridiculous and even that great actress can do little to make her character believable. I liked her dog though, a fine actress in her own right.

The actors all put in excellent individual perfomances (except Cher, who seems peculiarly out of place in 30's Italy), but the script is so wooden that even twelve coats of varnish followed by a sound waxing would not bring a dull shine.In summary, Mills and Boon with none of the excitement.  The only way I managed to keep awake was by guesing the next line or plot twist (I say twist, but arrow straight is more like it).  No cliche goes unturned in this movie, no heart string unjerked, no lovingly photographed element undeveloped.An enormous TURKEY.

There are a dozen different story lines and they go nowhere. A particular source of aggravation was the actor who played the young Italian boy as a teenager. To call him wooden would be an injustice.  He just wasn't there. Unbelievable, considering all the good young actors who are available.  The various actresses were fine. Cher was good, despite the criticism and the other ladies were too. But the script was embarassing.

The screenplay any less engaging? And what was up with the sound track carrying scenes because the dialog and actors couldn't?  I would recommend this movie to insomniacs as an instant cure.This movie is best left on the video shelf.

It's been a couple of years since I rented this, but I still remember this as one of the worst movies I've seen. I am not sure about the relation of the film makers to A Bridge Too Far, but I was surprised to see footage from that film included in Tea With Mussolini. The flawed illogical plot seems to repeatedly and frustratingly focus on the trivial background issues. Using WWII fascist Italy as a setting, every scene seemed to be a contrived set up for a melodramatic acting exercise. Assessing the acting performances separately and objectively from the ham-handed dialog and plot, most of it was unremarkable IMO, yes, even Cher. Perhaps this movie was based on a true story, but I felt it even mildly offensive to use the tragedy of WWII like this.

So I must say I was a little prejudiced. But I was right. The start of the movie showed a black and white still of Florence, and that was where the nice things stopped. The next 45 minutes mainly boring conversations followed in a movie that was totally without a direction. In the cinema itself, the oh no words were said frequently when Cher appeared. Why her? Why here? I want to go home. Seen it, didn't believe it, hated it.

It is difficult to unwittingly make a film which instantly qualifies as one of the 100 or so worst ones ever made. Tea With Mussolini manages to make a very good case for qualification in this category. It is simply dreadful, mawkish, unreal, manipulative hogwash.

But I have a feeling that the sea monsters who dwell in that dark part of the ocean (and will eat anything) will reject them too.It's a typical British snob movie. The women putter around with their giant handbags, squawking and walking like penguins while lambasting the Italian men for not acting like proper British gentlemen. (How DARE they not speak English?!) Reminds me of the term Pepperpot that the Monty Pythons coined for these Brit women.And all they gripe about is not having enough tea or scones or crumpets to stuff into their putrid gobs.I wish Mussolini's Black Shirts had bayonetted all of them.
