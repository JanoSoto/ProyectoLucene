It is surprisingly clean. No foul language whatsoever and it is soooo rare to find a PG movie that isn't targeting young kids/families (for those sensitive to this or can appreciate this element).2. There is a very significant secondary plot about music. In fact, I have this movie to thank for introducing me to the music of Al Green (I also own the soundtrack). The end's a little cheesy, but for someone who also played open mic's at one point, it's nice to indulge a fantasy now and then.3. Dave Foley's character has some truly funny moments. His stand up roots really shine through.4. It's not a teeny bopper. Lance Bass and his friends are past their college years, and Lance's love interest just finished grad school.So with that, it is difficult to predict who the movie was targeting, but it certainly got my attention.

However, his personal life is more of a shambles as he is painfully shy around women.  One day on a train in Chicago, he meets pretty Abbey (Emmanuelle Chriqui), who strikes his interest immediately. They both love Al Green, the Cubs, and history.  However, Kevin clams up at the end of the conversation and fails to acquire her name and telephone number.  He regrets his lack of fortitude soon after and decides to put up posters around the city in an effort to find her.  The local newspaper, spotting one of the signs, even features an article on Kevin's plight. Yet, Abbey fails to appear.  Will Kevin connect again with Abbey, even as he's fighting off the attentions of other women?With NSync member Bass as the star of the show, one would expect a movie only tweens would appreciate.  Not so.  Bass and Chriqui are winsome and winning as they seek to find each other again.  The scenes in and around Chicago are engaging.  The supporting cast is a bit goofy and grating at times (especially Kevin's friends) but, overall, the presentation of the movie is upbeat and humorous.  Fans of light-hearted romantic films would be savvy to seek out this little sleeper. A happy feeling will permeate the viewer's heart for a long time.

The film was directed by Eric Bross and was written by Eric Aronson and Paul Stanton, based upon their short film of the same title.On the Line tells a story of a shy Kevin Gibbons, an advertising executive in Chicago who's notoriously maladroit at dealing with the opposite sex. After a chance encounter with his dream girl aboard the El train, Kevin forgets to ask for her name and phone number and plasters the Windy City with posters seeking his lost love connection. Kevin's quest to find the mystery girl soon attracts the attention of a newspaper reporter and he becomes a media darling, while his roommates Rod,Randy, and Eric take full advantage of the amorous response by Chicago's female population to their friend's heartbroken search.On the Line has some clumsy dialogue and awkward turns.Also,it has a lot of thing unpleasant such as non-actors involved in the movie with clich√©d,formulaic,implausible and predictable story.Overall,On The Line provides nothing but entertainment for 'Nsync fans.

I figured that the story would be guy loses and then finds girl.  Which don't get me wrong it is, but it was more developed than that.  Now most would automatically shrug the movie off because two Nsyncers star in it, but you should never judge a book by it's cover or in this case a movie by its actors.  Lance Bass did a great job, and well the sense was given that Joey was practically playing himself.  The movie does have some crude humor, but the average child would not understand, and there is one curse word but you have to pay close attention to catch it.

While FJtK came out afterwards, this concept isn't anything new. Both used it, but unbelievably, this *Nsync Nightmare is actually, albeit slightly, better.What On the Line is, on the surface, mind you, is a romantic comedy of a love-lost boy trying to track down his soul-mate in the most ancient of ways in 2001 after one encounter during his commute. I bring up the year because this movie might have worked in 1981, but not in the internet-booming new millennium.Basically, Lance Bass' Kevin uses everything but what he needs, i.e. the net, to find the girl of his dreams. And we, the viewer, have to suffer through 85 minutes of his journey to know exactly how it will turn out. Even with a movie this short, it feels three times as long.So, beyond the sadly ironic title of On the Line because he doesn't know how to log online, the real tragedy here is Bass was never believable. Not for a moment. Granted it would be about half a decade later when he came out of the closet, you can absolutely tell throughout this movie that he is gay and he was not into women whatsoever. Obviously, watching this movie today we have the knowledge he's homosexual, but I believe if I saw this in 2001, I would know (no pun) straight-up he was gay.Just listen to how he talks about baseball, his character's passion, or how he looks and talks about women. There was zero chemistry between him and any of the opposite sex. And unfortunately for the movie, the secondary characters were just horrible individuals that spend most of the movie doing terrible things until they finally do the right thing. So, there were really no one to grasp or root for.The movie's only, and I mean ONLY, saving grace was the end credits. Again, even at very short 85 minutes, I was so frustrated with the film, I turned it off immediately as the credits rolled only to have to turn it back on then as I write this thanks to a certain podcast that told me about the additional irony in this film. Justin Timberlake and his other *Nsync co-boy-wonder pretend to be gay for a fake making of makeup scene. Actually, it's a wonder if they were trying to help their friend come out sooner or if they even knew about Bass. Most likely they did know about Bass being gay, but it didn't work as Bass wouldn't enter the real world for years later.Either way, it's not worth watching the whole movie for. Even though I liked some of the music, just stream the tracks ON(the)LINE and save another 70-80 minutes you'll never get back.* * *Final thoughts The podcast I referred to was the fantastic How Did This Get Made? I love listening to them, but you really have to see the movies first to fully enjoy their critique of the films they cover. So, yeah, they did, indirectly, make me watch two movies I had hoped never to see On the Line and the (lesser remake) From Justin to Kelly. At very least, I was entertained when I listened to their take.

With that aside...I was pretty impressed with the movie.It had a great story and actors to portray it.  Lance Bass is great as the hopeless romantic and Joey Fatone as the hilarious wanna-be rocker.  In my opinion both actors have a great start at what should be a long successful career if or when NSync comes to an end.  Emmanuelle Chriqui was just as impressive in her part as the sought after perfect girl and GQ is absolutely hilarious as Kevin's smart-allick friend.As for the movie itself, it was maybe a little too pre-teenly geared for me, but that is easily overlooked when considering the other adult-related content.  But I really think it has something that all ages and genders (yeah YOU guys) can appreciate.It is really disappointing if anyone casts this movie aside just because it is The NSync movie, because that isn't it at all.  15 minutes into the movie you don't even think about Kevin and Rod being in...what's the group's name again?However, I was very disappointed that Jerry Stiller didn't have a bigger part and with all the not-so-hidden advertisements (hello Pepsi and Frosted Flakes).But all in all I really think this is a great start for Lance as an actor and movie producer.

I'll be the first N*Sync fan to admit that I disliked their style but found Lance incredibly attractive, so much so that later I grew to like their music! ANYWAY, I think the movie was great, but that Joey Fatone's character was a little annoying, and he farted a lot of the time.. CQ's character was a little too hyper, and could have fit into the movie Half Baked as well as On the Line.. And the third friend, Randy (I forgot the actor's name) was a pure copy of Finch from American Pie (the one with the obsession of Stifler's mom).. But other than that, (oh, and if you ignore the heavy rock songs by Joey Fatone) it's a good movie.Still, I think someone should e-mail Justin and tell him he didn't belong in the movie, although I *DO* enjoy the gay hair stylist scene at the end... That's an Oscar nomination-worthy performance, if you ask me! That goes for Chris, too. And no one missed the Non-N*Syncer, J.C. No one even noticed he was missing until I realized that I'd only seen four of the boys.

"},{"Title":"On the Line may not be the 'N Synch movie, but we know what audience it caters to.","Date":"23 October 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Romance","Review":"  On the Line is the greatest film to star a musician since Blue Hawaii. Don't remember Blue Hawaii? Exactly. This film may not revolve around the music of the insanely popular boy band, but it caters to the same audience. In this story, Lance Bass (of 'N Synch) is Kevin Gibbons, the chronically date-impaired ex-rocker turned corporate adman. Kevin is now mocked daily by his friends for being the guy who blew it with his dream girl back in high school. Kevin, now 27, is about to get another chance. Kevin meets Abbey (Emmanuelle Chriqui, Detroit Rock City) on the `L' train in Chicago, and they mesh like... two cute people meshing. Kevin, the dweeb, fails to get her name and number before they part. It's an abused plot of boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy comes up with ludicrous way of winning girl back.After Kevin's slip-up on the L, he decides to flyer the city of Chicago. A newspaper gets a hold of Kevin's story, and takes an active role in spreading to the city just how pathetic Kevin is. It works magnificently and, soon enough, Kevin is inundated by calls from girls claiming to be `the one.' Meanwhile, at work, Kevin is under the gun for a Reebok ad that his partner steals the credit for. A slip-up leads to a tongue lashing from his boss Higgins (Dave Foley, News Radio). While responding to Higgins' rant, Kevin accidentally gives his friends the go ahead to turn his love life into a dating game. Kevin's friends Rod (Joey Fatone), Eric and Randy proceed to take the impostor L train girls out on dates, most of which end catastrophically.New acting talents Gregory Qaiyum and James Bulliard play Eric and Randy, the ghetto boy and the preppy kid. Qaiyum (who prefers to be called GQ), gives the most enthusiastic performance of the crew, but loses points for interrupting Al Green in the credits. Bulliard, who looks like James Spader's younger Swiss brother, loses no points for not singing, but fails to make anything of his deadpan dialogue. Joey Fatone lends a strong comedic presence to the film, and sings some decent rock covers too. Bass' character doesn't have the slapstick to fall back on, and the character of Kevin often falls flat. It's the willingness of the 'N Synch boys to poke fun at themselves that makes On the Line bearable to watch. Rod falls a lot, and Kevin leads such an embarrassing life that you can't help but smile. If they had been playing athletes or Casanovas, they would have seemed laughably out of place.With a PG rating, we know what kind of crowd this film was written for. When asked about his predictions for the public's response Bass states, `oh yeah, this is going to be known as the 'N Synch movie,' but he feels that it's not just for the fans. In fact, 'N Synch fans may be disappointed to discover that only two songs on the soundtrack are by the boy band. Relief may come from the other contributing musicians, which include BBMak, Vitamin C, Al Green, and Richie Sambora. A new solo song by Fatone, Ready to Fall, is also on the soundtrack. On the Line is a film starring musicians, who play characters that used to be musicians. While this may have been a safe play for the singers' movie debut, they didn't try very hard to avoid being typecast. This movie was built around the music.You've got to give Bass and Fatone a hand for their diligence. On the Line was filmed in both Chicago and Toronto, during the recording of their platinum album Celebrity. And it only took 32 days, which is the sign of a truly efficient filmmaker. As a producer, Bass roped in a few special guests. And yes, in case you were wondering, Chris and Justin have a cameo. Their ability to portray effeminate hairdressers is uncanny. As for JC, he must have been busy working on a solo album. That's not inside news, just wishful thinking. Directed by Eric Bross. Rated PG for fart jokes and beer.

The TV news had a huge MSN logo, the payphones had massive Verizon logos (even though Verizon isn't the phone company in Chicago...SBC/Ameritech is)2) The girl had a boyfriend who mysteriously disappeared. Did she break up with him? Did he fall on the L tracks? Is he still in that meeting days after the last mention of him? He seemed to be a pointless character. When she described him to her roommate, it sufficed. There was no need for him to be in the movie.3) What about the guy who wrote the article in the paper?

Too much fluff is bad.  Kevin lacks the un nice undertones to be believable-- even the best among us have some real flaws, not just a pseudo flaw of choking when dealing with the opposite sex.  Kevin is 99% pure fluff, and the attempt to make the character into a creative person fails because a creative person is more multi dimensional than pretty boy Kevin.  His friends are also painted in one or two dimensional strokes, and the Abbey role winds up painted so shallowly that it is difficult to conceive of why someone, even those as shallow as her fiancee and Kevin, would pursue her.Their instant connection soul mate behavior simply does not have enough questioning, enough basis for existing.  Even a child's balloon has more substance than what they created in their first meeting.  There has to be more than a smile, a list of presidents, or a love for a baseball team to make a connection.When it is finally revealed to him that he was betrayed, Kevin becomes violent toward a friend-- without really exhibiting anger, a perfunctory physical attack coming short of a playground fight.  The entire movie was surface gloss and fluff, but with the promise of meat and potatoes.I wanted to believe.Wish I could have.

Geez, I'm embarrassed to admit it, but I was sucked in and watched the entire movie.  I mercilessly mocked the concept of this movie when it first came out, but to my horror, I actually enjoyed many of its comedic moments.  I think it was refreshing because the young guys in this movie are not your standard, Hollywood sex fiends.  In fact, they managed to focus much of their entire lives on girls without even making any sexual innuendoes.  I think the lack of misogyny is what is immediately ingratiating about this movie.  I actually am blown away at Fatone's comedic ability, as I found myself cracking up many times at his oblivion.  Basically cliche is piled on top of cliche in this movie, but there are some surprisingly good comedic moments in the movie.  The pace is excellent, and in my opinion, the comedy way outshines the sappy romance.

If it weren't for the fact that I had laryngitis, I probably would have still been speechless.The twists and turns that this movie takes just left me on the edge of the aisle. (I sat on the aisle because the movie was packed with little girls who wanted to see Bill Cosby, but found out that this wasn't his movie...wow, they must have been disappointed due to the fact that Bill Cosby is in the Cosby family, and Lance Bass is in the Bass family...and last I checked, those are two different families, though I could, and probably am not, not incorrect.) But this movie was very gripping from the beginning, all the way to the end of the opening credits. I then had to go to the bathroom for the duration of the movie, but I could imagine it being the greatest movie in the history of the era of journalism meeting cavemen in a sea of rabid tigers.In terms of the acting, Lance Bass was very antidisestablishmentarianism, if that is a word. If it isn't, I would say that he was good. However, even though I am a huge fan of his, I would say that the good was not the good that you would say to a kid who cleaned up his room. But rather a good that you would say to a kid after he threw away your Mickey Mantle rookie card, in which case your good really meant bad. Thus, Lance Bass was basically a bass player for a bass farming fishery.In conclusion, this movie ranks up there with the all-time great movies, such as Fried Green Tomatoes, I Married an Axe Murderer, School Daze, and of course Lorenzo's Oil.If I had to watch this movie again, I would...and I did.

Reviewer A viewer from Dana Point, CA United States Lance Bass makes a stunningly awful debut in this stupefying waste of celluloid and is thoroughly unconvincing as a human being. His character is a virtual protozoa whose mindless pitch (Girlz on the Move) for Reebok is stolen by Bee Autch (Tamala Jones). Joey Fatone, on the other hand, is completely convincing as an A-hole who can't sing, likes to pick the underwear out of his ass hole and screws over his friends whenever he feels like it. Lance's sub-friends include a character only worth calling Tourette (he APPEARS to have the disease but is basically ugly and unshaven) and an unsurprisingly out-of-place preppie (or, if you prefer, Abercrombie & Fitch catalog model reject). We're unsure who portrays Abbey because she looks different in every scene. Sometimes she's Asian, sometimes Hispanic, sometimes Australian, sometimes Canadian (!)...well, MOSTLY Canadian, anyway. Sometimes she has a boyfriend, sometimes a lesbian roommate, sometimes her boyfriend is played by different actors in the same scene! Anyway, she looks like a sexually frustrated streetwalker waiting for a cigarette (preferably filterless) and her payment to be laid before her on the Ikea dresser. Speaking of which, incredibly, there is more product placement in this film than MR DEEDS or MAC & ME (classic '80s kiddie pic, if you're a MST3K fan, anyway). Pepsi, McDonalds, beer (too many kinds to name)...you'll have to suffer through the film if you want to hunt for them all! We now must mention the strange inclusion of Jerry Stiller as a gay copy room assistant and the poorly dubbed-over profanities, which is sometimes done by non-English speaking actors! Lance is at his best during a scene where the director instructed him to use the copy machine and WITHOUT closing the lid! We can see only his hairline and forehead, which convey emotion much better than anything below that. We can't neglect to mention the lone moment of indie cinematography where it appears that human emotion is conveyed through the chain-link fence but then the moment fades and we're saddled with Lance's expressionless face once again. We liken it to being on the cusp of the Big O and then denied the opportunity to realize it. In all fairness, this movie provided more unintetional laughs than GLITTER and CROSSROADS combined.(Note how Maraih's hairstyle conveys mood, tone, feeling, and conflict)Anywhoo, writing this review has been intensley cathartic for me and mine. Much love to the many actresses who played abbey P.S. Notice how on the blurb on the the back the intro says He met Abby (the love of his live) but didn't hear her name- Hello her name is abbey you just said it. I have a creeping suspicion that LAnce is responsible for this tag line and I also suspect he is illiterate. My favorite moment however is when highschool Lance hallucinates and his shirt flies off and we hear his inner monologue describe how his armpits are sweating(yet another example of ON THER LINEs Oscar quality writing). In close second for my favorite moment is the inspired scene where Kevin/Lance(the script used both names Lance got confused and tried to hide from the cameras)puts himself on the line to find his girl.

Emanuelle Chiriqui seemed charismatic enough in the small part made possible for her and it foreshadowed her prominent role in HBO's Entourage. Some of the most cringe-inducing bits were the supposed enthusiasm of Chicagoans for the successful resolution of Kevin (Lance Bass)'s search for the girl (Chiriqui) who he had seen on the train but whose contact information he had not got. Having lived in big cities most of my life, I know that people would sooner stick a dull stake through their hearts than betray even the slightest emotion or make eye contact with someone on public transportation and yet when Kevin's attempt to connect with the girl who he had let get away becomes public, it is as though West Side Story or Oklahoma or some energetic musical has broken out in the movie and tired commuters all of a sudden have a deep passion for the success of a romance between two people they know nothing about. The speech by two of Kevin's friends in an attempt to gussy up interest for finding the One Who Got Away, on a subway train, which is half-hearted and hoaky anyway, and which receives applause runs counter to everything I have ever found taking public transportation in a large city. One would sooner walk to work on one's hands than give even the slightest recognition to someone who attempts to elicit public interest in anything, on public transportation. The goofy love-story, sure, some girls (and maybe some gay men who would looooove to meet Lance Bass) may enjoy and it is harmless, if hoaky. It was the depiction of public environments made to appear as carnival spaces which was the funniest and most implausible aspect of the film, for me.

The Village People have Can't Stop the Music. Britney Spears has Crossroads. Jennifer Lopez has The Wedding Planner, Enough, Gigli...you get the idea. I think it's become an inescapable law of physics that when any singer decides that they have the chops to become an actor, what results is an evil hybrid of inflated egos and Satanic afterbirth. Want more proof? Presenting On The Line, starring both Lance Bass and Joey Fatone. This is one of the most ridiculous movies I've ever seen, mostly because it assumes that these two boy band rejects can act in front of a camera. Joey's actually supposed to be a decent thespian, but you would have no idea just from watching this piece of filth. He just comes off as loud, annoying, and patently stupid. As for Bass, while a cute guy, he's not exactly Lawrence Olivier. He just looks uncomfortable throughout the entire film and it made me feel likewise. Then there's the incomprehensible story, which defies common sense and the idea that God loves his children. Yeah, the entire city just STOPS to read about pathetic Lance and his search for a girl he barely talked to for less then five minutes. And why is his story on the front page of every newspaper? Is it a slow news day EVERY DAY in this city??? I laughed out loud when the front page of one paper featured a huge color photo of Lance and his gal and at the bottom was a much smaller headline about the economy. Yeah, that's realistic. Oh, why am I even wasting my breath? This movie sucks hard, and no one should watch it unless they enjoy getting their brains damaged. 0/4 stars (P.S. Dave Foley, what are you doing here?!?!?!

It's like they look in the mirror and they see Marlon Brando staring back at them (because we're all drama kings and queens on the inside anyway), and since they have the money and influence, they decide to give acting a shot. So, parts that could have gone to rising stars go to singers with enough star power to attempt a shot at the Hollywood spotlight. A good idea? From what I have seen of singers-turned-actors, with the exception of Will Smith, the late Frank Sinatra, Jon Bon Jovi, and Kevin Max (of dc Talk), no singer has the business of trying to be an actor. Period. Bass and Fatone, AKA Lance and Joey, as they have been dubbed by all the users here writing about how amazing this film is (who, apparently, are on a first-name basis with NSync) fall into that category. Fatone mistakes characterization for making loud, obnoxious fart-noises, and Bass thinks that raising those big, bushy eyebrows and looking wide-eyed substitutes for boyish-charms. No, actually...there's no charm there. It's just boyish, Lance.Granted, if the movie had been any good, we could forgive Bass and Fatone's horrid performances (and Richie Sambora for that matter--a brillaint guitarist who needs to stick to the guitar) and focus on the intelligence of the script. Unfortunately, there's nothing here we haven't already seen before. The keeps missing each other by a split second plot is played up to the max (and I do mean MAX! Not one cliche is left unturned), as is the Hey, you're my best friend and you betrayed me by dating my girl! misunderstanding, which would, I am convinced, never be a subplot in a movie ever again if either party would just stick around and explain themselves. If my negative review isn't clear enough, that doesn't happen in this movie.It's a sad thing when you can watch a trailer to a film and have the movie figured out, down to the very t, before you walk into a movie. I'm one of those guys who likes to insist that films aren't cheap entertainment, but rather, an overlooked expression of art. Make a mental note Anyone who would ever attempt to prove my claim wrong could reference this film, and I would be helpless to reply. As far as the chick-flick genre goes, this one is near the bottom (Pearl Harbor being the VERY bottom of the list). As far as movies in general go, this one is beyond the bottom of the list, and is dangling somewhere in bad-movie hell, wondering what went wrong. Ironically, the same can be said for NSync's career about now, too.I can't help it....I'm going to say it...Forgive me, but I cannot resist To On the Line I say....BYE BYE BYE!!!!Sorry.1/2 out of **** "},{"Title":"The Worst Movie of this year","Date":"11 November 2001","Score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Romance","Review":"  On the Line, where do I begin. This film is horrible, unappealing, dog s*** tripe.  How's that as a start?In the beginning of October a movie called Serendipity came out that had a concept like this, with a guy who looses a girl when he really liked her and isn't able to find her, but not in the way you think, I mean more intentionally.  On the Line is like that.  Remember when in the days of Ed Wood when his movies were shown in theaters and when people saw them they threw things at the screen and yelled at it and cursed at it and such, I felt like doing that while watching On the Line.Because while watching this movie I realized that romantic comedies should be buried, or maybe even cremated, without a wake or funeral.  Or, at least these type of romantic comedies, the types where beautiful people (they chock a lot of them in this movie) keep on being apart from one another, not because they want to be apart, but because of scripts that smell like they came out of the dumpster in the poor section of town in Calcutta (and have been written by the elite screenwriters of Hollywood).  The plot is something that I'll try to go through here- Lance Bass (ughh) of NSync (double Uggh from the guys) is an ad exec who meets a girl on a train (Emmanuele Chriqui who is actually rather admirable) and then just as they seem like they like each other a lot, Bass breaks it off and retreats back to his lair with his miscreant roommates- one of them another Nsync guy Joey (the fat guy to all you guys).I felt like screaming after seeing this movie, as I'm sure some of the smart people who wander into this drek will feel like doing, and even bad movie buff fans will want to hurl during the scenes that are meant to be cute and funny.

The cellioud itself is iconoclast, redefining itself and the genre as a whole. In film we have a man who is seperated from his would be lover via the manical train (representative of man's conflict with nature and his own increasing modernaization in the late capitalist model). In turn Fatone's character must search to  reclaim his lost love, but just as they appear to be reunited larger symbollic structures will keep them apart. For instance a large glass pane, (a nod to Freuds Id, and dismantling of the mirror stage, for through this glass, Fatone sees not himself but his lover, an analysis of both the social construction of self, and the dialouge of co-dependency). Will they end up in passionate union? Rent it and get TURNED ON THE LINE A brilliant piece of Shaduenfrueden.

This movie is unoriginal and obviously made for the pre-teens since the 2 leads are from NSYNC.  And the product placement just made a bad film awful. From the first 5 minutes when I saw the kid holding McDonald's french fries, I knew this was going no where fast.  I kept looking for Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks to show up since this is basically Sleepless in Seattle/You've Got Mail.  The only character that shows promise is Joey Fatone's, which is hard for me to believe since I don't really think he's got anything in NSYNC.  And Abby and Kevin never had enough screen time together to see if they had any chemistry. Not to mention, we never find out what happened to her boyfriend. Did she ever dump him?FINAL VERDICT  If you are looking for a cheesy pre-teen romance, then this is right up your alley.

I did not expect much but was still disappointed.The romance part does not work because you don't care for the characters. They are flat and off the rack. After an initial buildup with a bare minimum of depth everything is cut loose to advance the story with what should be perceived as comedy but fails.After recently seeing Serendipity (which is by no means great but has a heart and you actually care about the characters) which also features the romantic quest about destiny and finding the right girl after a chance meeting, this one is a sure looser in every aspect.I hoped for Emmanuelle Chriqui to be in a better movie, 100 Girls featured her in a much more interesting role but I think at least for her there is hope for a better future - for this movie the only hope is to be soon forgotten.

Well anyway, as for the movie, On The Line is a boring and predictable romantic comedy aimed right at the pre-teen crowd. Does it succeed as a film on that level? Kind of. On any other level? Not at all.     But I will say this I've seen films that were much worse than this, but I'll name some of those in a bit, first here's a brief review of the film.    Lance Bass is not too bad, and Joey Fatone is passable, the rest of the cast is not all that good though no one is overally irritating. The story and plot are simple yet full of holes, but at least the film goes by quick. But those who don't care for N*Sync, will likely be lulled into a deep sleep.    Now for the most part though it is a bad film, but now I'm going to list some that are much worse. Now in no particular order, they are, The One, 3000 Miles To Graceland, Just Visiting, Original Sin, Rat Race, Freddy Got Fingered, Monkeybone, Scary Movie 2, Domestic Disturbance, 13 Ghosts, Exit Wounds, Ghosts of Mars, The Fast And The Furious, Tomb Raider, Glitter, The Musketeer, Megiddo Omega Code 2 and Soul Survivors.  There that's a good amount of films that are worse than On The Line. Mind you it's still a bad movie, but not nearly as bad, as those listed above. * out of 4 stars.
