[{"Title":"Interesting & Nostalgic...","Date":"26 April 2003","Score":"30 out of 30 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Music","Review":" Grace Of My Heart is similar to Valley Of The Dolls because the characters, in both films, are loosely based on actual people showing their rise & fall in show business. Illeana Douglas plays singer/songwriter Edna Buxton who becomes Denise Waverly. She's based on Carol Klein who became Carole King. A New Yorker who churned out hit after hit in the famous Brill Building. Where some of the action in Grace Of My Heart also takes place. John Turturro is based on record producer Phil Spector (complete with bad toupee & the wearing of sunglasses indoors). Matt Dillon fronts The Riptides (The Beach Boys). The Luminaires are based on girl groups like The Shirelles & The Chiffons. Bridget Fonda portrays teenaged angst-ridden, big-haired, bubblegum idol & lesbian Kelly Porter. There's no question that she's based on Lesley Gore. Interestingly, Lesley Gore wrote the tune Bridget lip synch's in the film, My Secret Love (which is a homage to Lesley's You Don't Own Me). The music in this movie is very good & has that 60's, 70's feel to it. I just wish the soundtrack album had included the tunes Hey There & Grace Of My Heart by Kristen Vigard who did the vocals for Illeana Douglas. If you like nostalgic movies about pop music like The Idolmaker, Grease, That Thing You Do & Hairspray you'll like this too.

But this movie goes straight to my heart and puts a squeeze on it through the wonderful music, the sweet nostalgia and what a cast!Illeana Douglas is beautiful and she really plays her character with great talent. She's supported by a strong cast and how can you go wrong with Turturro playing Phil Specter? The first time I saw this there was something familiar about the music; the songs, like God give me Strength. As much as I like Elvis Costello, that scene of Illeana performing it for Matt (Brian Wilson) Dillon was such a unique delivery of a pure and powerful vocal. I later found that the 'familiarity' is Burt Bacharach and the 'voice' is Kristin Vigard Wow! Back in those days there was such an explosion of music and creativity and Burt Bacharach was truly a pop force.I loved the Brill Building scenes, especially when they were working on the songs. I thought the movie lost something when it moved west to California but was deeply moved by Douglas and Turturro 'having it out' at the empty poolside. The final song with the flashbacks and her crowning achievement of recording that one great album had me weeping again. I really like this movie so I ordered the DVD online.

Learning under the expert tutelage of cranky, eccentric, misanthropic Brill Building impresario Joel Millner (a fabulously freaky John Turturro) and enduring a steady succession of unsuccessful romantic relationships with footloose, insecure, insensitive bohemian songwriter Howard Castatt (a perfectly jerky Eric Stoltz), conventional married disc jockey John Murray (a typically fine Bruce Davison), and brilliantly innovative, but paranoid and temperamental surf-rock composer Jay Phillips (a splendidly spaced-out Matt Dillon), the extremely intelligent and resilient Denise uses her bittersweet life experiences as prime fodder for her ever evolving and emotionally charged songs.Flavorfully documenting rock music's growth from effervescent girl group pop to trippy psychedelic experimentation to intensely personal singer/songwriter confessional tunes, Allison Anders' simply sensational feature, loosely based on the real-life exploits of Carole King (besides the obviously King-influenced Denise, most of the other characters are clearly composites of various actual rock people as well) and executive produced by Martin Scorsesse, crackles with all the joyous vibrancy and infectious exuberance of the marvelously dynamic and exciting music scene its set in. Anders' deft, assured direction and sharply perceptive script, both keenly tuned in to the mercurial zeitgeist of the 60's and the then burgeoning women's right movement, works as both invigorating rock music history and inspirational pro-feminist tract alike. The splendidly catchy and melodious Larry Klein-produced soundtrack, Jean Yves Escoffier's smooth, agile, gliding cinematography, a story which manages to be genuinely touching without ever lapsing into mawkishly contrived sentiment, an absorbing, minutely detailed backstage glimpse at the pop music songwriting and recording process, and the uniformly superlative acting -- Patsy Kensit as Denise's longtime songwriting partner and loyal gal pal Cheryl Steed, Bridget Fonda as awkward closeted lesbian pop singer Kelly Porter, and David Clennon as a flaky hippie shrink are especially terrific -- round out this positively radiant and utterly delightful gem.

I thought the movie was very authentic in its presentation of the artists' struggles with becoming a singer in his or her own right, as well as a writer. It was not a popular position to be in in the 50's and 60's. I love Ms. Douglas. I thought she did an exceptional job with the material and the singing. John Tuturro was great as the manager and provided great comedic relief. Since his performance, I have gone out of my way to see everything he has performed in. He is an awesome actor! Most importantly, I enjoyed the music of Burt Bacharach. There is none other to compare. His songs are historic! My only concerns are these 1) I would have appreciated the female vocalist, Kristin Vigard recording the hit God Give Me Strength. I thought her voice was much more haunting and convincing. 2) Where can I purchase the Song Book for the sound track? I am now a teacher of middle school students in the arts program, and there are several clips from the movie that I have been able to show my students - and they love this movie!

In a thinly-disguised biography of Carole King, Douglas plays a singer-turned-songwriter in the early-'60s who feels the pressure of being a female under the thumb of powerful males in the music-biz but makes no major decisions about it; she's a strong woman, but also a go-alonger, and eventually she gets her chance to shine. The movie has some great scenes, but they aren't strung together smoothly, and the narrative keeps getting interrupted by half-comic bits of romantic confusion. Eric Stoltz (filling in for Gerry Goffin) cuts a nice figure in his shades and suits, but he has no personality; when he treats Douglas cruelly, there seems to be nothing at stake for her beyond raising their child alone (certainly she could do better). Several key supporting roles are wonderfully filled, particularly by John Turturro as a record producer and Bruce Davison as a radio-host (both are charming). Much of the music is dead-on in its nostalgia, the production values are fine, and Douglas is simply terrific (her toothy smile and wide eyes are endearing); yet the film hits a bump just before the final act and never recovers. Interest wanes, and that's too bad because Douglas works engagingly hard at creating a character we should care more about. **1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"Wonderful movie and amazing soundtrack...","Date":"11 April 2013","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Music","Review":" I love this movie and watch it EVERY time it comes on TV, even better when it's on a premium movie channel and you don't have to put up with ridiculous commercials.

She portrays a woman struggling (as we women always seem to have to do) in a mans world to be a music writer. With a bad marriage under her skirt and several other issues, she knows pain and heartache all too well which gives her the ammo she needs. Not doing too well with recording her own music she needs a little more courage to put herself out there. Well, it's a great portrayal of a woman who can't seem to get a break in her personal life but flourishes as a song writer. The music is great, going from the 60's to the 70's and for someone like me who was born in '59, appreciates when music was music and you could actually stand to even listen to a little pop music. Sure, there are a few comparisons to real musicians, writers and producers like Jay (Brian Wilson), Denise/Edna (Carole King), Joel (Phil Spector)but it takes on it's own story line and you just to have to come to your own conclusion.

You may be put off at first by the efficient TV movie opening which quickly and perhaps a bit glibly sums up the relationship of a domineering, aristocratic mother and quirky daughter who yearns to break free of her privileged suburban upbringing to become a pop music singer. But hang in there. A few scenes later you realize the rapid pacing and concise storytelling is the director's unusual and apparently risky choice of creating a film in the manner of it's subject the breezy and innocently naive world of pop music of the late 1950s and early 60s. You will soon become captivated by the plucky That Girl adventures of the heiress turned streetwise bubble gum songstress (played to perfection by the creamy, otherworldly Illeana Douglas) as she defers her dreams of pop stardom to write some of the biggest hits of the girl (and boy) group era. The ensemble is brilliant, including the lovably domineering John Tuturro as the Svengali-like visionary producer and the pouty, preening ego-maniacal boyfriend and writing partner (Eric Stolz). The rest of the characters are amalgams of many of the legends of 60s pop music our heroine meets on the journey toward finding her own voice. And if any of this seems too familiar, it is loosely based on the amazing life and career of Carole King. In some ways, this is the female bookend to another great, under appreciated movie about pop music of this era, The Idolmaker. But don't go dismissing this as a girl's movie, just because it's director Allison Anders is perhaps the finest female auteur in the business. This is a story that crosses sex, age and all other boundaries. For anyone who has ever felt they didn't fit in, who tried to please everyone and played it safe, waiting to follow their own dreams until the time was right, and then woke up afraid that it was too late ... this is a story for you. And the soundtrack. My God, the soundtrack. Far from parody, slavish recreation or disco-influenced revisionism, Ms. Anders has wisely chosen some of the heavyweights of the era to create pop hits that easily could have been hits on their own merits. The film is chock full of wondrous, alternate universe creations by such composers as Burt Bacharach and King's real-life partner Gerry Goffin, and even one by her daughter Lousie Goffin. This film is a joy from the first frame to the last. More than an homage to an era, it is an important addition to its story. But what if I can't just write another song?

She becomes successful as a songwriter renamed as Denise Waverly. She later marries songwriter Howard Caszatt (Eric Stoltz) and they have a girl together. Joel hires brit songwriter Cheryl Steed (Patsy Kensit) who would become her friend. More personal and professional challenges follow. She divorces Howard. She follows Jay Phillips (Matt Dillon) to California.There are some good moments but the movie is trying to cover too much of this character's life. For example, I like the fluffy pop singer played by Bridget Fonda who turns out to be gay struggling in her private life as she hides it in her public life. Of course, she comes in and then fairly quickly, she's gone. It becomes like a long string of random fictional events happening to a character that isn't particularly compelling. I do like Illeana Douglas but she's not really the lead actress type. She's a great character actress but she can't anchor a movie like this. She and she alone has to lead the audience through the various characters that come in and out of her life. She needs to be a bigger actress. Allison Anders has written a lot of things for Waverly to deal with but as a director, she doesn't have the style (or the money) to make this cinematic. The music isn't particularly memorable but they fit the era. Certainly this movie could use some great songs.

After 3 and a half hours of Bob Dylan, I was enchanted by the songs here. The soundtrack is a real tribute to love in all it's forms and fashions.Writer/Director Allison Anders, who started accumulating award nominations from her first movies (Border Radio; Sugar Town; Gas, Food Lodging) gives us a beautifully flowing story of a singer trying to break into the business, but settling for a career as a songwriter. It featured a lot of singers from the era, including one inspired by Lesley Gore, a favorite of mine, and who helped write songs for the movie.Illeana Douglas (Stir of Echoes, Happy, Texas, Cape Fear) was magnificent as the Carol King-inspired lead, as was John Turturro (The Big Lebowski, Fear X) as her manager.If you like the music of the sixties, and you want to see the first time a woman's water breaks on film, then this is it. A good use of your time.

I saw it today and it's still okay. Personally I think it could have benefited from some editing. The main character,played by Ileana Douglas wasn't strong enough to carry the movie. She was mousy, and if it were not for the extremely talented supporting cast, it would have been a total snooze. I lived through the 50's and 60's. I loved the way the film showed the the evolution of rock and roll. I was disappointed not in the music, which was spot on, but Edna's role. John Tuturro was magnificent as always. Although Eric Stolz was good, if I was editing, I would have cut most of his scenes. Fast forward to the caught in bed with another woman scene. The script really was totally predictable. The affair with the married man; Matt Dillon's suicide, no surprise there. But the most disappointing was Ileana Douglas. A better actor could have carried the movie. She is not star material. The 4 stars were for John Tuturro and the song, God Give Me Strength.

It is easy to see that the people that made it cared about the subject matter. But the awkward line that the film walks between fact and fiction never allowed me to sink into the story. I was always trying to pin down the characters (Don Kirshner? Leslie Gore? Cindy Weil?) instead of being engrossed in the story. And while the music tries to capture the magic, (Goffin even penned a few tunes) it ain't the original. No song in the film comes close to King/Goffin's `Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?'Illeana Douglas does a credible turn in the title role, John Turturro struggles a little with the schizophrenic record-producer, cut-throat businessman, creative visionary, but-friend-in-the-end role he's tasked with. I would have rather seen a film that was free enough to be pure fiction, or honest enough to be more factual.

I've read that Bridget Fonda's closeted lesbian teen character Kelly Porter was based at least partially on you.Leslie Gore Well, I think that's what they were trying to intimate. Was it true? I don't know, everyone seemed to be based on somebody and yet the stories weren't absolutely carved in stone. There was sort of a Carole King character, sort of a Brian Wilson character. So I think that was their intent.Interviewer Did you have any input when they were developing that character? Leslie Gore You know, I really didn't. They called me up to write one of the songs and I felt good that they called me, and then the next thing I knew, I received a song in the mail written by two guys, whose names I can't even remember, and I was so disappointed that I wasn't brought in on the ground level.And basically when I heard the song, I thought it was kind of terrible, so what I wound up doing is what I call doctoring, which is making some changes to make it a little more palatable. There were things that were totally unmelodic, and there were some lyrics that were just horrible, and I wound up making it, to my mind, a little bit better, and then I got a third writer's credit. And then they had the nerve never even to invite me to the opening when it premiered in New York. So I say screw them. So if it was meant to be me, they didn't handle it very well. There may have been some exploitative motive there--I won't second guess it--but that's what I suspect.

The acting does not get a chance to blossom regrettably as this could have been an interesting realisation on the ups and downs of one section of the music business.The story dwells a little too much on the cop-out soap opera angle while simultaneously trying to reveal an unconventional life. Sure, people are pretty much the same no matter what their experience but it rests far too heavily upon this one thing we, in my view, see far too much of in films. The life and loves of a musician is not a good enough reason to make a film.It also appears that the director was trying a little too hard to make a film that would be different. I would say that films such as Stardust or That'll Be The Day conveyed the life of the music business successfully; and I do not consider those films 'great'. So, I give this film a humble 5 out of 10 solely for its value in offering something to watch on television on a slow night. A great cure for insomnia.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.Weak directing and poor acting start to finish - I never thought John Turturro was capable of this bad a performance - he seems to know that the project is ludicrous and so camps it up way beyond what the shallow character created for him can sustain.Just about every scene in this film rings completely false; each scene seems painfully contrived to hit us over the head with some supposed step in the main character's development (or lack thereof).  And while these concocted scenarios are supposed to place us in a particular situation in a particular era, they all seem to point to a sloppy and badly distorted cultural chronology; this is the music industry and pop-culture-in- general regurgitated as if by some cheesy television production.The film is very obviously about Carole King - except when it finds it convenient to be completely off-the wall fictional.  In this story she marries an undisguised Brian Wilson - or maybe it's not Brian Wilson because this bad actor walks into the ocean and drowns. (Oh the obvious/odious Good Vibrations recording session - it's by the Riptides! - get it?  That's the sad level of half-baked analogy this film resorts to throughout.  Ugh!)And then there's the beatnik stuff, the hippie commune, the Brian Wilson guru character - I could go on and on... but I'd rather start trying to forget this cinematic bludgeoning I experienced last night.  (I still shudder to this day when my brain, against my will, brings back to mind George Burns bursting forth with  For the Benefit of Mr.Kite in that other, above-mentioned, waste of film.)P.S. Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach should have kept their amazing God Give Me Strength away from this shallow project. "},{"Title":"What exactly did you like about my record?","Date":"4 May 2005","Score":"1 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Music","Review":" Shooting at just under two hours, this is one of those films where you nearly feel winded after watching it in its entirety. Not that it is a bad thing to have so much happening in just a short amount of time, but with Grace of My Heart it felt like a solid blow to the gut. The lack of air, the whoosh of intense pain, and the increased blurred vision due to the excitement of the punch were all experiences that I had while watching this film. For those that can sit here and claim that this was a perfect film, I really beg to differ, but I will be a very brave advocate towards the originally average. This means that there were elements that I completely loved, followed in suit by elements that made me awaken at night in a pool of my own sweat. Grace of My Heart was one of those classic cinematic tug-o-wars that ultimately ended in a stalemate, but had fans on either side waiting for the final results.Beyond the cryptic comparisons that I make above, there were moments of honesty, especially when I was thinking about the elements that worked and those that did not. You cannot talk about this film without giving Anders the credit that she deserves for the music. This film could not have survived without the talent that was behind the musical moments. The energy, emotion, and cultural independence were ravishing. Literally, it could take your breath away and you wouldn't have even realized it. It set the tone and created the atmosphere for this film. As a viewer, you could close your eyes, ignore the spoken words of this film, and get completely lost in the music. The way that Anders incorporated established, modern singers to bring this era of the 50s, 60s, and 70s to life were brilliant. She deserved the accolades that followed the musical footsteps of this film, sadly &#133; I don't think she quite had a firm grip on the rest of the story.What I mean by this is that while the songs established the film, the story and characters hurt it. Illeana Douglas does exceptionally well with the material presented to her, but she just doesn't quite drag you into her life. You never quite feel as if you are right there with her experiencing her sorrows, excitements, and pain as she trudges through this man-infested life of hers. You watch her go through the motions, but you never feel that tear erupt or couch-excitement brew. It just doesn't happen, and why &#133; because 1) she never ages throughout the course of 20ish years (only gets thinner and thinner) 2) her voice is semi-whiney through the entire film causing us to feel like she was a bit sour and finally, 3) her consistent need for a man in her life. This latter I blame Anders. She never defines Waverly's character throughout the film. Is she a feminist? Is she as independent as we all thought? Does she create or simply steal from other's misfortunes? These are simple questions that should have been answered throughout the film, but instead we are nearly forced to explode (as stated before) as more and more information is jammed down our vision. It is nearly sickening. While Illeana doesn't carry the weight of disaster completely on her own shoulders, there are other characters that just didn't seem to fit the mold of the film. Bruce Davison and Matt Dillon seemed to be completely miscast in their respective roles, again constantly reminding us that we were watching a film, not immersing ourselves in a vivid story.The only character that I can give credit towards is John Turturro's Joel Millner. Turturro took his bit part to a new level always giving enough so that we constantly waited for him to reappear on screen. He was like an animated cartoon that brought more to the screen than any of the other characters mentioned above. That is sad to see for a film of this caliber, but it is what occurred. So, you take the grandiose excitement of the music and couple it with some sub-par acting and what do you get? Grace of My Heart in its purest form.Overall, it is never good to use more than one Fonda in your film. If you find yourself going with more than one, you should really be reconsidering your options. Matt Dillon completely ruined this film for me, while my keen eye had a blast picking out today's artists in this film. I just wish more was developed with Douglas' character. Why did she continually fall into love with the wrong men? Did anyone else catch that her creative songs were developed from the suffering of others? Finally, why did we bring up her family's fortune if it was never used throughout the film? I kept waiting for her to use her family money to build upon the climax of the film, but it never happened. I felt cheated, as I did several times during this film. It wasn't a bad movie by any means, but it just wouldn't stand out in a crowd. Grace of My Heart is the wallflower of the cinematic world.Grade ** out of ***** "},{"Title":"Didn't they find anybody else?","Date":"3 August 2001","Score":"0 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Music","Review":"  A few musicians' biography. Quite nice, yet nothing new &#150; the usual artist problems drugs, death and flops. The songs fantastic! But Illeana Douglas, that woman in the leading part &#150; what does she do in this movie? She destroys everything. She can't act. Actually, the role of Denise Waverly is not so difficult to play. I don't believe they couldn't have found other, better actresses. Publicity was not the reason &#150; nobody knows Illeana Douglas. Her voice was not the reason &#150; she doesn't sing her songs herself. Maybe she was the producer's girlfriend?The other acting performances, especially Matt Dillon's and surprisingly John Turturro's save the movie. Usually, his characters (even the one in `Barton Fink') are rather flat and one-sided. His crazy costume and toupée may be the reason why he does such a good job here.Only 6 points out of 10, thanks to Miss Douglas.

Phony sixties atitudes, phony sixties songs, phony story, phony phony phony.I mean, I think it's great that all the top movie stars are not stunning beauties, there should be ugly movie stars just as there are ugly people in real life, the only trouble is Carol King was actually quite a good-looker, so the point in having her played by such a dog is a little beyond me. Why no Carol King songs?  Did the makers think that, hey, anyone can write sixties type hits, that doesn't matter, we'll work those out as an afterthought.The whole point about Carol King's and Goffin-King's success is that they wrote some really - I mean really - great songs.So a Carol King biopic without any Carol King songs is kind of like a godfather movie without any bullets - it just doesn't workYeah, that's my summing up of this load of phony rubbish - it just doesn't work "}]
