Q. again tonight and had forgotten how much I love this movie.  It is wonderfully entertaining and leaves you feeling that all is right with the world.  I love the allusions to Mozart all throughout from the opening with Einstein playing Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star on the violin to him humming Eine Kleine Nachtmusik during the IQ testing of the Ed Walters.  I love that a woman is portrayed as intelligent and encouraged to have a career, an especially unique situation for the 1950's, the time in which this movie is set.  (I myself have been a teacher but stayed at home to raise my children, so please don't think I am some staunch women's libber.) It's wonderful how a man who is only a grease monkey is finally seen to be just as important and worthy as Catherine's fiance, a clinical behavioral researcher.  The message to me is that we are not what we do, but who we are is defined by so much more - no labels.  There are so many little gags and one-liners that are almost throwaways if you don't watch and listen carefully.I did catch a few things in the movie that are not listed on the goofs page. In the scene when Ed Walters is to speak at symposium, there are 3 instruments (protractor, ruler, etc.) hanging on the right from the chalk ledge.  In the next camera shot, there only 2.  In the credits on our video, it lists Tony Shaloub's character as Bob Watters, not Bob Rosetti as he introduces himself in the movie and is listed here on Imdb.I highly recommend this movie.  It may be a piece of fluff in some estimations, but has lots more substance than many give it credit for. Not only that, what a great cast is assembled here.  Watch it and enjoy!

Meg Ryan was at her peak in this frothy throwback to the golden slapstick days of Hollywood. The seven dwarves concept (actually four elderly university professors, one of whom just happens to be Albert Einstein) works just as well here as it did in the two old Hollywood movies this film liberally lifts from. You know the films I mean a gang moll moves in with a bunch of bachelor professors and falls in love with one of them while the others do everything they can to advance the romance. The first version starred Gary Cooper, if I am not mistaken, and the second, a musical remake, starred Danny Kaye.

You cannot go wrong with Meg Ryan's cute perkiness combined with Albert Einstein's genius. Normally, I'm not a fan of completely fabricated fictional tales about actual people, now deceased and not able to defend themselves, but I think the late Einstein might himself have gotten a chuckle out of this one.It's the 1950's...Princeton, New Jersey in the spring. The story revolves around a pretty, young, scatter brained mathematician, Catherine (Meg Ryan), who is all set to marry a stuffy jerk, a behavioral researcher named James, merely because he has the brains she's looking for in the father of her future children. However, it's love at first sight when her car breaks and she meets an auto mechanic named Ed (Tim Robbins). As she doesn't think Ed is intelligent enough, her uncle, none other than Albert Einstein, plays match maker, assisted in his endeavors by three mischievous cronies, all theoretical physicists. Uncle Albert must make Ed appear suitably smart, so concocts a charade portraying him as a physicist...naturally with amusing results.Walter Matthau is his usual hilarious self, and pulls off the character of Einstein quite effectively. With his three professorial buddies, Kurt, Nathan, and Boris, a lot of laughs ensue. The real Einstein had a genuine human side and this film just takes it one (outrageous) step further. If you suspend all logic, you can almost imagine this silly story happening!It might not be rocket science (despite its main character) but it is a wonderful sweet, refreshing movie.

For that matter, it is equally rare that I am gasping for breath through the laughter during several scenes. The love story is a little thin on the ground, but I'd say that's probably for the best, as this romantic comedy has the emphasis firmly on comedy, and in any case it stretches the bounds of credibility just a little more than I like most rom com's to do.  The four scientists provided some of the funniest moments not just in this film, but in any film I've seen in a long while.  I hesitated for the briefest of moments before finally choosing a 10 over a 9 as a rating, as I believe that far too many people use it indiscriminately, and therefore the maximum rating loses some of its impact. I'm also a big Meg Ryan fan, which helps, but this is one of the few films I've seen in which I'd say she is comprehensively overshadowed.  She and Tim Robbins are cast as the leads, but for me play second fiddle to the antics of the bumbling intellectuals.  A genuine laugh-out-loud type film.

The end result is a fun movie with surprises throughout.

Tim Robbins (Edward) had Meg Ryan (Catherine) in the palm of his hand when he was convinced to lie to her about who he is as a human being. They were obviously love-struck at first sight (excellent acting by both, but particularly by Tim Robbins), and the story took a sick twist when Edward begins his ruse. I went from liking Edward, to dis-liking him, in one short minute. How can I root for someone whom I distrust?I almost turned the film off, because this kind of deception and manipulation really makes me angry (even in a movie). When Edward begins having half-hearted reservations about his deceit, it was enough for me to hang on and watch the movie till its end.As I've noted, Tim Robbins' acting in this movie is excellent, as he plays a somewhat suave, sexy character, entranced by Catherine. Ryan does a great job playing the part of a woman star-struck by Edward.

This romantic comedy directed by Fred Schepisi is a very charming film. The film is about friendly garage mechanic, Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) who is trying to impress a smart Princeton University mathematician, Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan) by acting a newly discovery genius with some help with Catherine's Uncle, Albert Einstein (Walter Matthau) and his buddies, fellow scientists Nathan Liebknecht (Joseph Maher), Kurt Gödel (Lou Jacobi), and Boris Podolsky (Gene Saks). The casting for Albert Einstein's friends almost were originally going to be Peter Ustinov, Barry Humphries and John Cleese. No matter who was cast, they see Edward as someone who would be better suited for Catherine, rather than her stiff and fussy English fiancé, experimental psychology professor James Moreland (Stephen Fry). Things get heat up, when the science community heard about this 'wunderkind' genius work on Cold Fusion power rockets, and seek Edward to help the American take back, the space race from the Russians. I have to say, everybody is just charming. Tim Robbins is a fine actor who is believable, but he was a bit difficult during filming I heard. He said in the '90s nobody would like a character who has a woman fall in love with him because of a lie. That's the whole premise of the film. In my opinion, I didn't mind it, but I think Tim Robbins was right, because not a lot of people end up going to see this movie. Meg Ryan is a hot smart woman who looks wonderful in the poodle skirts. She looks really young in this role. Stephen Fry was pretty good, and at less, the filmmakers didn't make his character too unlikable. Last, I have to say Walter Matthau fit the part. He did a great job to the point that it seem like Albert Einstein was playing himself. For dramatic reasons, I.Q. fictionalizes the lives of certain real people. Albert Einstein did not have a niece by the name of Catherine Boyd. Kurt Gödel was famously shy and reclusive, so he probably wouldn't be hanging out with Einstein and Boris Podolsky. I like how the movie didn't play it safe, by over explaining the calculations of the physics theories. If you don't get the jokes. It's alright. I didn't get some of the things, they were saying, too. Plus, I study physics before, coming into this film. I love to do my research, and I think I learn a lot from this film. I never heard of Hamiltonians, iambic pentameter, zeno paradox and others. The odd humor might leave some people scratching their heads, but overall, most of it was pretty simple to understand. The comedy works as well. I love the debate scene about if time exist or not. The whole I.Q test was funny, but a bit unrealistic. The Spike Jones music scene was pretty odd. The Marlon Brando impression was great. By the way, people, the impression was from 1953's Wild Ones and 1954's On the Waterfront, not 1972's the Godfather. I love the movie soundtrack very much from Jerry Goldsmith. The violin melody of Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star was amazing to hear. Other songs heard was the Alphabet song, and some classical music from Wolfgang Mozart, and Joseph Haydn. Some critics didn't find the movie great, because Einstein in their eyes seem too silly or dumb. I doubt Einstein was such a hard head scientist. Einstein reportedly was playful and fond of jokes that could be seen by some as childish, but in the movie, he was indeed sound smart with all the terminology. I love how they got away with the PG rating with all the sexual innuendos, down speaks, and euphemism. There was a lot of dark humor as well like example, the man stuck in a box without a sense of time. Minus, the historic accuracies, this film is fun to watch. This romantic comedy is full of wahoo!

For some reason the greatest scientific mind of the 20th Century had never been the central figure in a movie*. The closest I can think of as films with Einstein in them are CHAMPAIGN FOR CAESAR, where (like a deus ex ma-china) the great man is heard clarifying a point on a radio quiz show, so that Ronald Colman is proved to have given the correct answer after all, and in BULLSHOT where the great Albert is one of a dozen leading physicists and scientists who are drugged with cannabis by the villain, intent on stealing some machines of theirs. It is notable that in those two cases, and in IQ, we are dealing with comedies. So far nobody has tried to do a serious film about the life of Einstein, like John Huston's attempt to do one on FREUD with Montgomery Cliff. I guess it is just too hard to get the world of mathematical equations or the secrets of electro-magnetic field theory into exciting dialog. But then, only three years ago Russell Crowe and Christopher Plummer did A BEAUTIFUL MIND. Maybe nobody really has tried.(*Subsequently, after writing this, I remembered the successful comedy YOUNG EINSTEIN with Yahoo Serious about ten years ago. But that is an exception and it was a spoof.)The other surprise was the actor playing the great Albert. It was Walter Matthau, here taking time away from the series of films he did with Jack Lemmon in that last decade of their careers. Matthau was a highly capable and gifted character actor, in both comedy and drama, but normally his comic personas were variants of his Whiplash Willie Gingrich from THE FORTUNE COOKIE. They were connivers and gonifs. Later they would shed their criminal propensities because we had grown to like them, but they remained grumpy types. But his Albert Einstein happens to be genuinely sweet. More like his Kotch than like Willie Clarke.He plays Albert as good old uncle Albert. It seems that Matthau's Einstein is living in Princeton with his niece Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan), and she is seeing a stuffy professor named James Morland (Stephen Fry). But Fry's car needs repairs, and they take it to the auto shop where Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) works. Robbins falls for Ryan, who is attracted to him - but finds that he lacks the mental equipment that she admires. Good old uncle Albert, aided by his three friends (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher, and Gene Saks) decide to give their assistance to Robbins and make him an apparently unrecognized physics genius. This will open the doors of romance between him and Ryan, provided Ryan is impressed and Fry does not spoil things (as he hopes to do).The atmosphere is sweet, as when Matthau and his chums rig up a super physics quiz that they help Robbins cheat on (by switching the positions of their bodies). The plot eventually leads to the outright lie that the brilliant Robbins has constructed an atomic powered rocket ship - which brings in the interests of the nation in the figure of President Eisenhower (Keene Curtis).It was a charming comedy, and an interesting stretch for Matthau in that he was not as hyper as normal, but far more subdued.

Einstein is brilliantly acted by Walter Matthau, while Meg Ryan's Catherine is unforgettable &#150; better than I have seen her in those films opposite Tom Hanks &#150; as the young mathematician struggling to be recognized.You don't need to be a young woman to understand Catherine's struggle and feel sympathetic for her immediately, and as a young man it's easy to understand what must have gone through Ed's (Tim Robbins) mind in pursuing his true love. There's universal appeal in these emotions, even if I.Q. keeps it all light, fun and tied up nicely.Sure it's not heavy, but if you look there are some subtexts. People remember Albert Einstein as a scientist yet he was a great spiritualist; his sayings such as something along the lines of, 'If it is not impossible, then why do it?' suggest he is a believer in fulfilling higher goals beyond one's immediate grasp. In this film, there are questions of what an accident really is &#150; such as whether Albert and his whacky sidekicks' intervention in prying Catherine away from stiff-upper-lip, loveless James (Stephen Fry &#150; who gives this otherwise cardboard character life and you cannot help but feel for his lack of feeling) counts. How much intervention happens in our lives that we do not see, and comes across as serendipitous?And of course, we'd like to think in real life, despite what we often observe of the people we know, that we Edwards get the Catherines and Jameses have to learn how to defrost the icewater in their veins.

Walter Matthau gives a humorous and warm portrayal of Albert Einstein. Einstein was known to have a sense of humor and wit that complimented his scientific genius. Here are some of his clever and funny quotes. Gravitation cannot be held responsible for people falling in love. Two things are infinite the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe. Reality is merely an illusion, but a very persistent one. Education is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned in school. It's too bad the screenwriters couldn't write in some of Einstein's quips in the script. At least, I didn't see or hear anything that might have been his. But, the situational humor and fun lines they put in work fine. And, Matthau is perfect as the physics genius in his last years. The time of the film would have been the early 1950s since Einstein died in 1955. But the coterie of cronies around him aren't historically placed by age. The script conveniently plucks them from their locations around the U.S. to be residing with Einstein in his New England home. These characters all add to the humor and fun of the film. Lou Jacobi plays Kurt Gödel (1906-1978), Austrian born and later American mathematician and logician. Gene Saks plays Boris Podolsky (1896-1966), Russian-born physicist who taught at the University of Cincinnati and then Xavier University in Ohio. Joseph Maher plays Nathan Liebknecht, a fictitious character possibly based on Karl Liebknecht (1871-1919), a German Socialist. Meg Ryan is Catherine Boyd, Einstein's niece, who seems to have inherited his genes for genius. Her nose is buried in mathematical theories, and she plays a sometimes flighty character very well. Catherine is engaged to an English psychologist researcher, James Moreland. Stephen Fry plays the stuffy, snobby Moreland very well. Tim Robbins has a blue-collar job. He works in a service garage, but besides his brawn, he's something of an automotive engineering whiz without a diploma. His Ed Walters falls for Catherine the first time he sees her. The rest of the story is how Uncle Albert and his cohorts can manipulate things so that Ed can replace James as a match for Catherine. It's not a complex plot or very deep story. But it's fun and innocent. And, worth the time just to watch Matthau bring his wry manner to Albert Einstein's witty and personable character. Einstein wasn't just a physics genius and witty professor. He also was a provocative thinker who challenged modernist trends. Here are a few of his pearls of profound wisdom. Science without religion is lame; religion without science is blind. Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds. Weakness of attitude becomes weakness of character. There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle. Peace cannot be kept by force. It can only be achieved by understanding.

I.Q. has a lot in common with Roxanne, probably Schepisi's best-known comic movie made several years earlier. Both films are romantic comedies based upon a love- triangle with two men in love with the same woman. In both films the woman is a highly-educated intellectual, and in both one of the men tries to impress her by pretending to be more intelligent or more educated than he really is. In Roxanne the woman is an astronomer; here she is a mathematician, but we learn that her father was an astronomer and the appearance of comet plays an important role in both films. The action takes place in New Jersey in the 1950s. If you want to be precise, both Dwight D. Eisenhower (as President) and Albert Einstein appear as characters, so the action must take place between Ike's inauguration in January 1953 and Einstein's death in April 1955, but as the film takes a number of liberties with historical fact that sort of precision is not really necessary. (For example, Einstein is seen listening to Little Richard's Tutti-Frutti, which was not released until after his death). The heroine is Catherine Boyd, Albert Einstein's (fictional) niece, who has obviously inherited her famous uncle's brains as she is a brilliant mathematics student at Princeton University. Her two admirers are Ed Walters, a garage mechanic, and her British fiancé James Moreland, a university lecturer in experimental psychology. As is normal in two-boys-in-love-with-one-girl type rom-coms, the two have very different personalities. Although Ed has good general intelligence he has little formal education, but is amiable and caring. James is academically brilliant but a pompous stuffed shirt who treats Catherine with patronising condescension, believing that her main function in life will be as mother to the brilliant children to be fathered by himself. Catherine's uncle Albert realises that James, for all his academic prowess, is a complete prat, so tries to persuade her that Ed would be much better suited to her. To this end he and three friends, the scientists and mathematicians Nathan Liebknecht, Kurt Gödel and Boris Podolsky, come up with a scheme to convince Catherine (and the world) that Ed is a scientific genius. The weak link as far as the acting was concerned was, in my view, Tim Robbins as Ed; l felt that the role needed someone more relaxed, less serious and younger. (The age difference between Robbins and Meg Ryan is only three years, but here it seems much greater). According to Schepisi, Robbins was unhappy with the way his character was written, feeling that nobody would like a man who has a woman fall in love with him because of a lie, and it seems as if some of this uneasiness comes across in his performance. (There is a difference in this respect between IQ and Roxanne, where it is the unsympathetic, and ultimately unsuccessful, suitor, who pretends to a level of education which he does not possess). Ryan herself, however, makes a sweet and appealing heroine. In the nineties she (along with Julia Roberts) was Hollywood's official Queen of Romantic Comedy and here she achieves the feat (as did Daryl Hannah in Roxanne) of playing a woman who is not only attractive but also educated and intelligent without resorting to that old bespectacled bluestocking cliché. Walter Matthau was one of those actors who never seemed to retire, or even to fade away, but carried on taking leading roles in major feature films throughout the eighth, and final, decade of his life. Perhaps his best-known role from this period was in Grumpy Old Men, but his Albert Einstein, portrayed as loveably mischievous, kindly and fun-loving, is far from being a grumpy old man. His three colleagues are all played in much the same way, and as being around the same age as Einstein, although historically this is not accurate. (Kurt Gödel, for example, would only have been in his forties at the time the film is set; Lou Jacobi, who plays him here, was 81 when the film was made). I wouldn't rate IQ quite as highly as Roxanne, one of the best romantic comedies of the eighties, although with a stronger male lead it might have fall into the same category. Steve Martin, the male lead in Roxanne, is one of that film's great strengths, much better than Tim Robbins is here, although on the feminine side Meg Ryan is just as good as Daryl Hannah. Overall, however, IQ is a highly enjoyable comedy, warm and human with its central theme that life is as much about the heart as about the mind. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Excellent Jewish Comedy","Date":"21 December 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" A comedy of sorts, and yet a dream more than a real story.

The rest is Jewish antics and humor about life and death, love and the unknowable, the mind, the spirit, the soul, the brain, or whatever is residing up there in the skull. Some say love is not always on time, and they are wrong because love is always on time for those who believe time does not exist, and they are numerous since time, you know, hours, minutes, seconds and weeks and months are nothing but a human intellectual construction on the basis of the experience of the duration of things that cannot be measured and is absolutely as regular as a clock that is speeding up going up and slowing down going down, or vice versa.

And did he wear socks in one scene...reportedly, the professor never wore socks! (Two new entries for the IMDb goofs section.) Historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies aside, this was a great movie to watch with a great cast. I give it an 8!

Walter Matthau plays Albert Einstein, trying to help mechanic Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) fall in love with Princeton mathematics doctoral candidate Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan). Probably the funniest scene is when Dr. Frizzyhead and friends (Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks and Joseph Maher) try to make Ed look like a scientist he ends up looking like a French impressionist.Obviously little of the movie is historically accurate, but that's not the point. It's not intended as anything except a light comedy, quite the opposite of Robbins's most famous movie from 1994 (The Shawshank Redemption). A movie about Einstein's whole life would have to focus not only on his scientific achievements, but also his political activism, namely how he wrote a letter on behalf of the Scottsboro Nine and came out against nuclear weapons (it got to the point where the FBI kept a file on him).So anyway, this one is acceptable. Also starring Stephen Fry, Tony Shalhoub, Frank Whaley, Charles Durning and Keene Curtis.

Einstein has always been one of my heroes and the image of him as the kindly, playful, slightly mad genius was enough to get me to see the film. The added spice of Matthau as Einstein made it even better.The story is pure fantasy, but a delightful one. An auto mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman, who happens to be Einstein's niece. With the help of four Fairy Godfathers of Physics, Ed embarks on a quest to win Catherine's heart. Throw a jealous fiancé (who exemplifies the worst of experimental psychology) and Eisenhower into the mix, and you have pure fun.The film is filled with great character actors and delightfully sweet and daffy performances. Walter Matthau play Einstein as a mischievous imp; cupid with a slide rule. Tim Robbins is wonderfully endearing as Ed and Meg Ryan plays a step above her normal rom-com level. Stephen fry is a joy as the RRRatman and Ryan's fiancé; who lacks a single romantic bone in his body.The film fell below most radars, but is a delightful treasure that does not grow stale with repeated viewings. It features first-rate writing and performances and is a gentle treat in a less than gentle world.

I.Q. owes a sizable debt to these great films, yet does no harm in emulating them. And the reference to Minnie Driver was a mistake on my part. I meant Sandra Bullock, in WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING. In that very funny movie, Bullock does a hilarious pratfall with Bill Pullman on the lawn of her apartment complex that looks an awful lot like the pratfall Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins take on the lawn of a public park in I.Q.

It was sort of a guilty pleasure to watch. Meg Ryan seems to be able to pull off roles in this kind of film (another example is Joe vs. the Volcano). That's what makes her a star, in part. Walter Matthau, of course, had that ability, too, and he really puts himself into the role, making an amusing, good-hearted Einstein. I suppose you could say they're both good at portraying loveable characters, though loveable in different ways (loveable young women vs. loveable curmudgeon).

It has its funny moments as well i did like meg ryan but unfortunately Meg Ryan always plays that same sort of part so she did well but its time for a change of role for her. Tim Robbins of course this is only the second movie i have seen him in so he to me is an OK actor IMO he is a good B grade actor to me. As for Walter matthau he to me was the star of the show and even though he has passed on he will always be an A grade star in my books. This is good but at times be a bit silly and most of all repeat itself but as like i said it was original and funny in parts. So what are waiting for have some fun rent it out.

It could have been better, it could have been worse.The best thing about the movie is Walter Mattheau, several great lines, and the cute Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins.Great bit parts too by Tony Shaloub (the future Monk).The writing could have been a lot smoother. The moment that Catherine figures out she love Ed, was very very jerky. There should be better revelation, or some key piece of information, thought or action before she figures this out. She's letting him down one second, and without so much the blink of an eye, she's saying I love you. No hesitation, no thought, no decision made.. just... boom! However, fun fluff calls for a bit more susspended disbelief than most movies and it was a cute movie. Definite chick flick.. but if you want something more thought provoking, more deep, try Sliding Doors, or Amelie.

And that wasn't the only reason for me to have my doubts about this movie. I.Q. is yet another romantic comedy. Hollywood's streets seem to be paved with scripts for these movies and if we are honest, than everybody will agree with me that the most of them aren't exactly exceptional. Still, despite all these drawbacks I gave this movie a try and the only reason for that was because this movie had a more 'daring' and original approach.Edward Walters is just an ordinary auto mechanic when he meets the intelligent and beautiful Catherine Boyd. It's love at first sight, but there is one problem that will keep him from marrying her James Moreland, a brilliant scientist with who she is engaged. But Walters might have the luck of his life when Catherine's uncle, Albert Einstein, likes him and will do everything to make Catherine see what a great husband Edward would be for her.As I said, this movie had a more or less original approach. I don't think there have ever been other romantic movies with Albert Einstein in it. And it has to be said, it worked. Seeing Einstein as the fun loving genius is perhaps a bit weird, but it also offers the best humor in this movie. Everything else in this movie is decent, but not exceptional. The performances are OK, as is the story, the humor could have been a lot worse and overall this certainly isn't the worst movie in the genre. If it hadn't been for Einstein and the other scientists in it, this would probably have gone by me unnoticed, but now I give it a 7/10 "}{"Title":"Everything works so well together!!","Date":"18 August 2001","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  When I first watched I.Q. I was in America and was instantly captured by its amusing charm and a 'starry' cast! I really liked Walter Matthau's character as Einstein. He was both funny and serious, which is exactly the mood of the film. Although it always has a funny bit in it, it also retains its serious mood, which when blended together produce something which is watchable and easy to chuckle at time after time!!      Tim Robbins and Meg Ryan also played their roles beautifully and put as much feeling and action into their work as was needed, and even more!! Great to watch f you like funny films that make you chuckle!!I gave it a well deserved 9/10!!

Trying to impress the girl of your dreams by showing high intelligence?  At the moment I can only think of the Cyrano story as having a similar motive (which is actually a very depressing fact).Matthau is very good as Einstein and the make-up department worked hard to make him look like the real thing.  Sadly, no such effort has gone into his friends Lou Jacobi looks nothing like Kurt Goedel, presumably because the film-makers thought that hardly anybody knows what Goedel looks like (or who he is, for that matter).The one thing that I find annoying about the film is that the scientists are given the 'Ball of Fire' treatment - and that film was modeled after Snow White! They appear more cute than bright. Generally, their discussions are kept in too general terms - they just would not conduct their scientific discussions in such a broad and non-technical way it just is not productive. Still, Stephen Fry makes a fine excremental psychologist.
