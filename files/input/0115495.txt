There are the movies that are made because someone believed they would and they held out long enough to get them made. Then there are the actor's movies, the ones any actor worth his/her salt would love to make themselves. This is Kevin Spacey's actor's movie. That's not a bad term in the least. The majority of the movie is set inside a New Orleans bar, but the scenery doesn't get tiresome. This is due to the fantastic performances of the cast. I love it when I can watch a movie and forget that the person I'm watching is otherwise known as Gary Sinise, Faye Dunaway, or Viggo Mortenson.The film is also a classic tale of inhumanity, on how far people need to or will go to save their own skin, on choices. It sounds clich√©, but the movie doesn't come across that way in the least. Overall, I recommend the film for a lazy Saturday afternoon, like it was for me.

On second viewing, recently, it still is an interesting film   to watch, but it basically left a lot of questions unanswered because   of the screen play Christian Forte wrote.    One can see what attracted Albino Alligator to Mr. Spacey. It's a   film where the situation that is created at the beginning of the film   allows for intense performances by the first rate cast the director was   able to put together. There are holes in the plot, like the enigmatic   presence of Guy, the Canadian man one sees sitting at Dino's but whose   role in the whole thing is not well explained by the screen play.    Matt Dillon, as the man in charge of the bandits makes a good   contribution. Faye Dunaway is excellent as Janet, the bar maid that   must make tough decisions at the end of the film. William Fichtner is   at his most intense playing Law, the loose cannon. Gary Sinise doesn't   have much to do. The ensemble cast is good under Mr. Spacey's   direction. John Spencer, Skeet Ulrich, M Emmet Walsh, Joe Mantegna,   Melinda McGraw and Frankie Faison are effective in their roles.

Also, he's good with his actors, especially Dillon, Dunaway, and Sinise.But the movie suggests Spacey should learn about reading scripts next time. The movie harks back to films like PETRIFIED FOREST, but is little more than a clone of them, and writer Christian Forte often falls back on obscenities to substitute for character development and plot.

Kevin Spacey shows some promise as a director, but the script sometimes let's him down. Even so it's pretty entertaining, and the best thing about it is the outstanding cast. You might think Spacey would call upon his Usual Suspects buddies but instead we have Matt Dillon, Gary Sinise and William Fichtner as criminals on the run, Faye Dunaway, M. Emmett Walsh, Skeet Ulrich, John Spencer and Viggo Mortensen as the occupants of an after hours bar they hold hostage, and Joe Mantegna as the cop on the scene. All the actors performances are good, but I especially enjoyed Fichtner's redneck sociopath and Mortensen's mysterious French Canadian who may not be the average joe he appears to be. Both actors have been favourites of mine for some time.

The perfect plan. It all goes wrong. They're in trouble. The police are outside. They're cornered. What are they gonna do now?Sound familiar?The movie seems like it's trying to be a combination of the acting workshop, the indie film and the theater.It's the kind of things that actors love--it's kind of like a workshop or a play because it mostly consists of tight focusing on the actors acting... acting angry, tense, scared, conversing, scheming, planning--giving the performers a lot of free range to really ham it all up.A trio of crooks, one leader, one goon, one brother, come up with a big heist scheme... and a monkey wrench is thrown into the works. To top things off, there's a bit of a fender-bender and one of the crooks in flung through the back of the windshield.The cops are on their tail and they stumble into a bar named poetically (and leadenly) Dino's Last Chance.Spacey, as a director, tries to keep the focus on the actors' performances and delivery of dialouge. He pans over to a bright passion-red cigarette ad of a smoking and smoldering Bogart. And he keeps all the violence off-screen, really.I think that was a mistake. Focusing on the intensity and gruesome violent scenes would have given the movie some edge.The problem with the movie is that it moves too slow and suffers from miscasting in almost every role. Matt Dillon (Drugstore Cowboy and Wild Things) seems too young and too idealistic to be the leader of this gang.Gary Sinese seems to brooding and deep in thought to be a spineless tag-along with these guys and Joe Mantaga is effective as the traditional routine foul-swearing mad-dog police lieutenant who's all thumbs, but he isn't given anything to really do here.William Fischter is the only actor who is believable in his role as a brainless grunt who just wants to spill blood.And the crooks are in a tense situation where they either go to jail or they try to think of some way out of this.Spacey lacks the ability to create a lot of tension and keep it going. The characters are mostly chatting away, trying to think of a plan... and they're to calm and too articulate. There's even a scene where the crooks are playing pool with a whole swarm of armed cops right outside, ready to strike. At one point, one of the crooks even call the police who are right outside the bar. Oh brother. Oh bother.These cops are going to either blow them away or going to lock them up. Shouldn't the holed-up crooks be a little scared, a little uneasy? Meanwhile, all the real action is happening inside.Someone whips out a gun, a baseball bat, which leads to an ugly confrontation off-screen and there's one more casualty that happens that's... well, kinda sad. But...Faye Dunaway also should have spent more time with a dialect coach, improving on her New Orleans accent. Skeet Ullrich is fine in a smaller part.A cop listening in reaches for a pack of matches at the absolute worst time is a nice look. And so is a scene where someone goes right through the rear windshield. The dialouge is obviously trying to go for a David Mamet approach and it's as profane, but never as realistic or as insightful. I'm guessing Christian Forte is a fan Mamet fan. The movie feels like too much of what it really is... a really low-budget movie with an actor behind the camera for the first time directing other actors from a script that's not bad, but needs a few more re-writes. Spacey shows he's not a terrible director, but he lacks a sort of feel for shaping a movie and it feels like he's just filming actors act.These actors are all talented and could work with the material, but they all feel out of place. As I said before, the movie really suffers from miscasting. I don't mean that the wrong actors were cast. I think they found just the right cast, but placed them in all the wrong roles. I think switching some of the roles would've helped immensely.Having veteran mob actor Joe Mantagna play the leader of the pack, Gary Sinese as the angry police lieutenant outside on his bullhorn giving orders and barking at his troops, keeping Fischter in his bloodthirsty goon part and Matt Dillion as the sacrificial lamb. That would have been a big improvement.When some actors direct, it works. They can even win Oscars for it. But a lot of the time, when actors direct, they have a tendency to just focus on the performances. Just shoot the actors acting.Sometimes it works... but they need a good showcase for it. An excuse for it.Hostage situations are all pretty much the same in real life just like coming-of-age stories so it's only natural that movies about them will go from point A to point B as well.There are a few really great entries into this genre.' Spacey himself appeared in a similar movie about hostage situations The Negotiator.This certainly won't become a cult classic, let alone one of AFI's 100. Still, it does have a few nice moments and personal touches, but in the end, it's instantly forgettable and the kind of movie that would play best on regular TV. It's just not worth going out of your way to see.I give a 3 out of 10. Spacey's other directorial credit, Beyond The Sea was reportedly a better effort. Hmmm... maybe it's true.

Dillon & Sinise play thieves who hold the bar and its few inhabitants (two men drinking and a young man playing pool) hostage late one cold morning along with their psycho accomplice (played by the versatile William Fichtner) after a shootout with police.  It rolls along at a leisurely pace and reminds me of a filmed play, not unlike The Petrified Forest but with less ham & almost zero humor.  One of the hostages is brutally beaten to death and Dunaway reacts beautifully; the tension-breakers are few and far between.  Loads of foul language including the one hilarious moment involving the lead cop (Joe Mantegna) and a nosy reporter, the only time obscenity is really crucial to the plot.

That it's not is due to an unsure screenplay, lacking in credibility, though not lacking in promise. The story in itself, if tightened up, could have been riveting. But despite the actor's efforts, Albino Alligator fails to deliver the goods. By the end (which in itself is powerful), one has become a bit tired of it all.Spacey was obviously drawn to the clear theatricality of much of the action taking place on one set, in effect on one stage. It's hence very talky and stagy, though Spacey is careful to keep the camera moving in interesting ways. The few outdoors scenes too are shot with great visual style. Combining a keen eye, together with his understanding of actors and acting, Spacey will probably at some point bring his directorial talents to fruition. Hopefully he will be more fortunate as far as a suitable screenplay is concerned.Matt Dillon in the lead does a fair job. As is often the case with him, he manages some moments of excellence, but on the whole is capable rather than brilliant. (He sustained an exceptional performance is the Saint of Fort Washington and surprised many with Drugstore Cowboy.). It's as if there is a depth to him which he seems to have a lot of trouble reaching. There is a brief scene in Albino Alligator in which he talks to himself in a facing mirror. It's a moment which reveals those depths which so often seem to elude him.The other players do as well as one would expect. Gary Sinise is superb as Dillon's elder brother, William Fichtner is truly edgy and sinister and Faye Dunaway's bartender has a ring of truth to it.Despite all this talent and a story with possibilities, this is not one to seek out.

It has a talented cast ,with Matt Dillon, Gary Sinise, Viggo Mortensen, E. Emmet Walsh, Joe Mantegna, Faye Dunaway and William Fichtner. The film asks the dramatic question Would you kill an innocent person to save your life? It's an intriguing question that deserves a much better screenplay. It also deserves a much better answer than offered by the filmmakers. The screenplay is a mess. What should be a character-driven story seems largely driven by unlikely coincidences.Much of the action occurs off screen. A burglar alarm is tripped, a character commits suicide and a character commits murder &#x96; all off screen. These are three points that alter the course of the plot, but the audience doesn't quite know why they happened. The burglars seem to have tripped the alarm trying to gain access. If so, the police wouldn't be able to charge them with much, unless they have prior warrants. They could have simply split up and walked away in separate directions. They might have dropped their weapons and lock picks down a sewer grating. Instead, they call attention to themselves by speeding away in a stolen car. The character motivations are unclear. An international criminal arranges a meeting at closing time in a basement bar with no back exit. The person he is supposed to meet never shows. A possible exit has been covered over with cinder blocks. Unless the cores are filled with concrete and steel bars (which is uncommon), cinder blocks are fairly easy to break with a sledgehammer, claw hammer or anything reasonably hard. With enough shells, they could break through with the shotgun. But they don't even try. The police procedures make no sense at all. The plan for escape made sense in the Bill Murray comedy Quick Change, but not in a serious drama, although the trope worked reasonably well in 16 Blocks. The least sensible and least satisfying part is the answer to the dramatic question. One character commits suicide, presumably because he's been betrayed and he refuses to kill innocent people. One person is a sociopath, so doesn't face a moral dilemma. One character is given a revolver and given a choice between killing an innocent victim and going free, or dying. But one would think holding a loaded weapon would offer a third option. This is the climatic moment, but it occurs off screen. The characters who choose to kill an innocent person do survive, while those who do not die. Buried was produced four years later with a much smaller budget of $3MM. It was gritty, compelling and effective. AA is not nearly as effective. The difference is primarily due to the caliber of the scripts. The film looks more like a stage play than a feature film. Most of the exterior shots could be eliminated without severely damaging the story. Since the exteriors really show the budgetary limitations, the film might actually have been improved. The movie has a good cast. It's not sufficiently compelling to engage the audience, but neither is it sufficiently egregious to completely alienate.

In a film where there is not much action and most of the scenes are shot in a couple of locations, it is imperative that suspense and continuity are provided by the director. Not so here, the great cast is horribly under-used, none more so than the great, late John Spencer, the plot is so run of the mill and nothing you haven't seen in a hundred other TV movies.

All of this contributes to making a film great. You failed in all these areas, Kevin.The film did begin with a bang. The action scenes were terrific. But the drama inside the bar soon becomes uninteresting due to bad direction. And the actors mumbled too much at times. The scenes outside the bar with the police officers and the news reporters were not particularly well written. I am not saying it was utter crap. It was interesting for a while.

It's in all the confusion that resulted in a deadly car chase where three cops & FBI Agents were killed that the gun smuggler found his way to Dino's Bar! That was just minutes before it was raided by the trio of petty crooks that the police were chasing thinking that their part of the gun smuggling operation. That trio consisted of the brothers Dova & Milo, Matt Dillon & Gary Sinise, and their partner the psychotic Law & Disorder or just plain Law for short, William Fichtner.With Dova Milo & Law not knowing exactly what their wanted for and with the cops and FBI Agents not realizing whom those in the bar are, hostages and hostage takers, the tense stand off lasts for hours into the morning. That's when the police under the command of FBI Agent G.D Browning, Joe Mantegna, plan to raid the place at exactly 700 AM with the help of a SWAT team. As the minutes tick away the usual level headed Dova starts to lose it who against his brother Milo's, who was badly injured during the car chase, sound advice plans not to off the hostages plans to blow them all away if the cops make a move on the besieged bar. As for bar owner Dino, Emmet Walsh,who tried to be a hero and take on the trio of bandits he sadly ended up getting killed with his head bashed in, by Law, for his efforts.***SPOILERS*** It's hostage Janet Boudreaux, Faye Dunaway,the waitress at Dino's Bar who does her best to keep the tension from boiling over and becoming deadly. That's by her advising the leader of the trio Dova that she and the rest of the hostages in the bar won't point him and his motley crew out after the police raid the joint! By her telling the police that the hostage takers escaped thus,in mistaking them as hostages, giving the three a free ride home. What Janet kept from Dova up until the very last moment is that her son like the person whom the police and FBI are really after is one of the hostages! Kevin Spacey directed film that comes across much like the Humphrey Bogart & Bette Davis 1936 crime classic The Petrified Forest with a lot more meat or story to it. With a totally unexpected and heart dropping ending that would not have been possible back then in 1936 due to the prudish and My way or the highway moral constraints of the then powerful Hollywood Hayes Commission.

Unfortunately, he didn't get it right the first time. The visuals work well, the acting is tolerable.  However, even though the story provided some good ideas, these ideas were not fleshed out in characterization or action.  It is a simple story with a few twists that could have been done more convincingly in another writer's hands.  Also, I believe that a different edit of the film would have created a more boxed-in, no escape, hopelessness feel that was missing in this film. watching this film, it looks as if Dunaway wants to do so much more, but is stifled by the script.  Dillon is unconvincing in his role.  I wish he could look back to his earlier roles for some inspiration (drugstore cowboy, rumble fish, even my bodyguard).  However I think this is only a stumble for him, not a downfall.  And worst of all sins, Joe Mantegna is wasted in this film.  Again, mostly I blame the script, which almost seems like a ripoff of dog day afternoon, including the reference to media intervention.  To assemble this crew of actors and use them so inefficiently is not good filmmaking. This film should be looked at by those interested in making a film, because it has the potential to be a lot more than it is.  An admirable effort, but misses the mark. "},{"Title":"Not entertaining and no substance","Date":"19 March 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" Albino Alligator saw Kevin Spacey play director for the first time. The film is your every day story of a bunch of criminals holding a bunch of people against their will. It's not very original; and it's not very good either, as while Spacey was casting the film, he seems to have forgotten to think of a point for it. Albino Alligator features a rather impressive cast list, which includes the likes of Faye Dunaway, Matt Dillon, Gary Sinise, Skeet Ulrich, Viggo Mortensen, William Fichtner and M. Emmet Walsh; but no Kevin Spacey himself, who spends the entire duration behind the camera. In fairness, Spacey's direction is assured enough, and he ensures that the film runs at a smooth pace all the way through. The majority of the film focuses on what is going on inside the bar that the thieves have hijacked, and this is offset by the police and media presence outside of it. However, rather than going down the road of Dog Day Afternoon, Albino Alligator keeps both of these sides of the story separate...and the result is a film that is more boring than it could have been.The acting is your typical 'heavyweight' stuff, but I can't say that it impressed me much. I was a bigger fan of Matt Damon before his role in the cheesy flick 'Crash'; but this is one of his 'miss' films. Faye Dunaway enjoys herself in her role, but doesn't impress with it. Gary Sinise and William Fichtner aren't given a lot to do, despite appearing for most of the running time. I liked Skeet Ulrich in Scream, but roles in films like this have ensured that he doesn't get noticed. Viggo Mortensen proved himself recently with an excellent performance in A History of Violence - but here he's simply in the movie and the only actor here that I like is The Simpsons' Fat Tony, M. Emmet Walsh, who is entertaining as a copper outside. He is rewarded in this respect with the film's best scene, which sees him swearing to a press reporter. It would seem that writer Christian Forte tried to fill in the gap where the point should be with an anecdote about albino alligators; but quite how this really figures in the plot is anyone's guess. The film doesn't even capitalise on the fact that it has a load of different characters stuck in a space together. On the whole; there is nothing to recommend this for.

A man who has played in movies like Glengarry Glen Ross, The Usual Suspects, Se7en and L.A. Confidential needs no more recommendations because his outstanding record already speaks for itself. But being a good actor who played in several excellent movies doesn't make you a good director yet. Both jobs are completely different and not everybody who can act is able to direct. With Albino Alligator, Kevin Spacey made his debut and he certainly had some good actors to work with. But good actors aren't enough, what you need is a strong story.Albino Alligator has nothing to do with a white reptile with red eyes. It tells the story of three petty thieves who are chased by the police after the alarm went of at the place where they wanted to break in. Because one of them gets wounded during the chase, they decide to flee into a basement bar where they take five hostages including all of the bar's employees. But what they don't know is that the police isn't looking for them, but for one of the hostages who is actually a Canadian criminal. They see no other option to get out of their but by using a trick called the Albino Alligator, they will have to sacrifice a couple of their hostages to get out of there alive and stay out of the hands of the police...As a debut this isn't a bad movie, but it never reaches to a high level. The main reason for that is because the story isn't all that good. It uses too many clich√©s and doesn't offer any exceptional material for the director and his actors to work with. In fact, I might even say that it is thanks to the professionalism of actors like Matt Dillon, Faye Dunaway, Gary Sinise,... and the good direction of Spacey that this movie is still worth a watch. It's obvious that the movie has been made with a small budget and it certainly didn't have the best script ever, but it is good enough to be entertaining on a rainy afternoon during the summer time (that's when I saw it) and I must admit that I've seen worse debuts than this one.

Now I know.Albino Alligator centers on three men. Dova (Matt Dillon), Milo (Gary Sinise) and Law (William Fichtner). Besides having very unique names... they get themselves into the 'ol situation of digging the hole deeper and deeper taking an admittedly bad situation and making it even worse. The men are nothing more than petty criminals, who find themselves camping out at a local bar after a job goes wrong. It's not long before the police show up and naturally they believe they are there for them. Nervous and somewhat edgy, they take the few bar patrons hostage. Then they do what people do they panic, they become unpredictable. Things progressively deteriorating as they overplay the situation and dive deeper into a mess they've gotten themselves into.The only real answer is to walk out of the bar, but desperate men don't act rationally in movies because if they did the whole thing would be over. So they sit there flipping off dialog and things get progressively worse while the bar as the backdrop for the majority of the story serves as both a blessing and a horrible limitation. While it creates some much needed tension and paranoia for a tightly knit boxed in story of this sort - it doesn't add up to much scenic variety or any real excitement.Which leads me to wonder why there are so many people involved in this film. The story seems so low budget minded that I believe it could have easily have been done with a no-name cast and director to a possible better result. Never less having a crowd of recognizable faces in a film is always helpful when the character's aren't really fleshed out. At a certain point, I believe it was only the recognizable cast keeping me watching. Matt Dillon is easily convincing as the ringleader of the trio who slowly loses control of the situation and Sinise gets to carry out in vain the role of the wounded puppy dog who has to be put down. Everyone is playing a turn on a character we've seen before. The guy who wants to do what's right, but loses control in the end, the man who knows things aren't going to turn out right etc etc.In the end, Spacey breaks no new grounds with his directorial debut. It's soundly made both in front and behind the camera, but lacks any real distinction. The whole production is handled adequately, but it never gets creative within the scope of the story it's trying to tell. It's a tale that we know won't have a happy ending and while it does not, it's at least unpredictable... and it's here that I find the finale to Albino Alligator more worthy than the sum of the movie.

The only thing that impressed me about this film was the one shot of the car wreck from above.  The center line of the road was perfectly centered and the camera moved on along the line and past the wreck. However, that shot was very Usual Suspectsish and my guess is Spacey got the idea from that earlier film of his (which is very good mind you). If you want to see a fabulous film that takes place in one small setting, watch Hitchcock's Lifeboat.  Maybe Spacey should have watched it before filming this. "}{"Title":"Excellent Movie!!!

Director Kevin Spacey, working from a tight and gripping script by Christian Forte, relates the riveting story at a smooth pace, milks plenty of nerve-rattling claustrophobic tension from the premise, maintains a tough no-nonsense tone throughout, delivers several startling moments of abrupt'n'brutal violence (a car crash that sends a man flying out of a windshield at the start stands out as an especially impressive set piece), and pulls off a fairly surprising ending. The sturdy acting from the fine cast keeps the whole thing humming Faye Dunaway brings her redoubtable A game to the role of sassy and cynical barmaid Janet Boudreaux, Viggo Mortensen likewise excels as the quiet and mysterious Guy Foucard, Skeet Ulrich is solid and likable as the naive Danny, Joe Mantegna huffs and puffs with rip-snorting √©lan as the hard-nosed Agent G.D. Browning, and M. Emmet Walsh is a total rascally treat in his regrettably smallish part as crusty old bar owner Dino.

Albino Alligator does an interesting job looking at everything the people in the bar trying to maintain their composure and sanity, while the cops try to figure out what to do.Maybe this is a look at our lives in general (the way that we find out some things about the characters), or maybe it was made so that Spacey could call himself a director, I don't know for certain. It's not a great movie, but interesting. Matt Dillon, Faye Dunaway, Gary Sinise, William Fichtner, Viggo Mortensen, John Spencer, Skeet Ulrich, M. Emmet Walsh and Joe Mantegna all do as good a job as we can expect from them (don't let anyone tell you that Faye Dunaway has outlived her usefulness; trust me, she still has what it takes).

It seemed to be a safe option for Kevin Spacey's directorial debut. He managed to assemble a fantastic cast for not very fantastic roles. The cast all do well without anyone really excelling. To be honest I thought Matt Dillon was a bit over the top with his hard man role which I dont think he really pulled off, on the other hand Fichtner was suitably scary as the cliched nutter. There are some nice touches in this film as well as a great scene where the policeman is interviewed by the nosy reporter.Overall a good film but Spacey must take more risks as a director if he is to carve out as good a directing career as his acting one.

Mistaken for the target they hole up in a bar to find themselves surrounded by police.  With no way out the three are forced to take the bar hostage as they work on an escape plan.Kevin Spacey's directorial debut is an understated little thriller that is a little stagy but still enjoyable.  The plot is simple and the twists are a mix of predictable and silly &#150; however the slow pace makes it easy to accept.  The drama is mainly in the bar and is mostly dialogue &#150; this makes any action seem even more sudden, although the end happens very quickly and is a bit of a letdown.The director uses the one room well and has plenty of nice visual touches.  The rest is down to a good cast who all give strong performances.  And what a name list it is &#150; Dillon, Dunaway, Sinise, Mortensen, Ulrich, Walsh, Mantegna &#150; even an actor as good as Spencer only gets a few lines.Overall, despite the star laden cast this is an unassuming thriller that is slow but still enjoyable.

What seemed to be an ordinary rough bit of film-making suggested that it definitely was not worth while sitting down and typing out any kind of commentary, and so, in these cases, I consulted some of the comments from other contributors to IMDb about this film. Which I do not do when I am going to write a comment I read other contributions after sending mine.With the result that Kevin Spacey behind the camera is much better (or at least probably will be) than in front of it. A little in the style of Robert Redford who took up directing to give us some excellent films such as Ordinary People, A River Runs Through it, and even The Horse Whisperer (albeit in this last case with a Redford dutifully sleeked out to appear much younger and thus more desirable&#133;&#133;..), Spacey has tried his hand at directing nothing less than a character-driven drama.And the end result is not at all bad. A couple of scenes of violence I personally could have done without, perhaps, but given the entire value of the film I should not quibble. The directing was pretty good, the acting was not at all bad in the most part, and the story-line had enough twists to keep it interesting right up to the closing scene. Michael Brooks' music was spot on, as it had that evanescence which never intruded, but you felt it was there; imaginitive composing.As far as theatre drama goes, Albino Alligator had a few failings in interpretation, perhaps, as, for example, one could expect something a bit more convincing from Faye Dunaway, but certainly the other main actors played their parts rather well. There was enough credibility in the production which makes me think it is going to be worthwhile waiting for Spacey's next film as director; and I've never really had any great taste for him as an actor. And if he chooses Christian Forte for the script again he could well be on course for another film worthy of comment.On the high side of 7 out of 10 for this one.

A holdup where the police surround our criminals and they are forced to make hostages of the customers inside. No movie will ever do it better than Dog Day Afternoon, but Albino Alligator gives it a nice try. The criminals seem like decent characters and their mission is to find a way out of the mess they're in. There are three major surprises that are discovered one by one. One of these shockers changes the entire outcome of their plan. The movie is well written and always keeps you focused and interested. There is no waisting time in this one and everything that happens is important. The surprises are thrown in to make sure the audience will not get bored with the story which takes place almost entirely in the same room. The movie was never boring to begin with and the surprises just make it even better. The movie is good fun.

So I really 'enjoyed' this one, especially William Fichter's performance. Now I'll have to have a Fichter Festival!But here are my questions How can Matt get away with his crime, with his brother being carted off to the morgue? Does he just walk away? Can he? Why was the gun runner from Montreal, who they were really looking for, in that particular bar? too much deaux ex machina, if you ask me. They all had a thing for mothers, which was very good but probably wouldn't ring true today. Sinise gives himself up as the albino alligator, but why does Faye shoot the bar fly. Why didn't she just shoot Matt? After all, she had the gun with one bullet in it. Of course, they wouldn't have been motivated to cover for one another if that had been true. Good acting, lots of suspense. And there was quite a few funny lines, for a murder/robbery movie. Matt does really well playing a slightly dense criminal. And have you noticed At least 5 of his movies feature his relationship with an older brother Outsiders, Rumble Fish, Tex, and this one, not to mention 'Over There'. Why they didn't blow open the front of the building to begin with, I don't understand, but i loved the duplicitous media woman, so realistic, so true for our time of propaganda bull hockey media, who care nothing about the truth.

An oblique tribute to Bogart is made as the bar in which most of the movie takes place has an old Bogart cinema poster on its wall which features Key Largo (not The Petrified Forest).If there is any similarity between the two movies separated by sixty years it is mostly at the beginning and the bar-hostage situation which occupies about four-fifths of the film. However, Albino Alligator is not a remake of The Petrified Forest. In the Bogart film escaped convicts end up in a bar and terrorise its denizens. In Albino Alligator (referring to a type of pool shot derived from a legend about the alleged habit of alligators to sacrifice weaker members of their own group in order to trap and destroy their rivals) three men are running from the police after a botched warehouse burglary and end up in a basement dive in a pre-Diluvium New Orleans named Dino's Last Chance Bar; a one time basement speak easy which is just about to close for the night. They terrorise the barman , the middle-aged waitress-come do-it-all and the three customers though it is fairly apparent that they are amateur villains but for the one dangerous self-acknowledged sociopath.The Petrified Forest was criticised for being a bit too theatrical, not surprising as it was taken from a stage production. And that may also be true of Albino Alligator but one could say the same of the highly acclaimed Bus Stop starring Marilyn Monroe, in which all the action takes place at a Bus Stop-Coffee bar in Montana.The first ten minutes or so of Albino Alligator -where the burglary is botched in the most amateur way by setting of the warehouse alarms and the escape from the chasing police cars takes place - are basically irrelevant accept to explain why the men are forced to find refuge in the bar. The movie is mainly about the interaction among the burglars and between them and the bar denizens and outside between the local police chief , the FBI and an investigative woman TV reporter. Every character has a vital part to play in the unravelling tale. Nobody is quite what they seem at first sight.There are a few twists, quite well done, and it would be unfair to reveal them. Inevitably the cops arrive as unnoticed the barman has pressed a below counter alarm. But it is never explained how the cops knew exactly who they were seeking in the bar- the film's only flaw. Some of the best film actors alive today comprise the cast and perform wonderfully. The film has been criticised for its profuse use of foul language and violence by those who would prefer to watch Walt Disney movies but such criticism is laughable.This is the sort of film you either detest or love. I loved it. It was never destined to be a blockbuster. It seems the producer and actors didn't expect it to be one. It is the kind of movie actors love to be in and producers die to make but this what those brought up on Hollywood mush don't seem to understand. Some admiring American reviewers would describe it as a European style film .But few European films ever get this good. The whole setting and characters are purely American proving that America can make really good movies if the desire is there.

Despite the talent of a host of great actors, Dillon's weak performance led to this movie only showing in a few theaters before being put out to video in my opinion. Kevin Spacey's other big mistake, besides casting Dillon, made to avoid looking vain, is not casting himself as one of the two brothers. On the positive side, Faye Dunaway is outstanding. The fast-paced opening, however, slows to a crawl after the set-up, which put the audience to sleep. The twists and turns inside the bar, and the character's reactions to them, don't seem like how real people would react. For a young writer that doesn't read the how-to books on screen writing, however, Forte wrote a well-structured, derivative, but innovative thriller. I was one of the few people that saw this movie in the theater, and the light was too dark. Best wishes to Christian and his new wife, from the uncle of his old girlfriend from CAL BERKELEY.
