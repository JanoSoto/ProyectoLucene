It was exaggerated, of course, but still interesting to see and in many respects good to see because of the onslaught of tabloid-mentality journalism that seems to have taken over the media in recent years. That kind of reporting should be exposed and ridiculed.Whatever, you can enjoy this film for the acting alone with Dustin Hoffman, John Travolta, Alan Alda, Robert Prosky, Mia Kirschner and Ted Levine. These actors, and some good dialog, make the film move along at a good clip despite the absence of much happening on screen.The story gets you involved and reminds me of the famous 70s film, Dog Day Afternoon, in which much of the film takes place in a bank. Here, it's a museum, and a man is in a predicament something like Al Pacino was in that film except Travolta's character here is totally innocent.The screenwriters added bit of humor to this involving story and that made it even better. It's very good entertainment and certainly recommended.

However, it IS a brilliant, scathing satire of the media's true power in modern-day society.  Instead of going for overkill like the pathetic Natural Born Killers, this movie uses dark comedy, brilliant performances, and genuine thrills to create one of the most clever and powerful social commentaries to be seen in film in years.  If you're expecting a typical Hollywood thriller with a formula plot and a nice, neat ending then you'll be disappointed, but if you're looking for a smart, powerful film with brilliant performances by Dustin Hoffman and John Travolta, then I would recommend this movie.  In a time when events like the O.J. Simpson trial make the media's influence in our society more than apparent, it's refreshing to see a movie willing to stare this issue right in the face.

Upset and defeated, DUSTIN HOFFMAN's character goes there and has the chance of running into what will prove to be the story of his life a guy enters the museum and takes everyone inside hostage.  It's a smart movie, just because it debates themes that can only lead to smart scenes. Probably the best thing about MAD CITY are the actors Travolta and Hoffman are great in their roles and they add an extra-value to the movie by the way they act.What if you really need money to support your family and you just got fired? How far are you able to go to get your job back? Far enough to enter a museum and threat the owner with a gun? Surely. But what if by mistake you do something that you can't get out from? That's Travolta's situation.What if all your life you aimed for a great story that will totally change everything about you? How far are you able to go? Far enough to play the victim's life in your hands an organise a live show from which you practically doom him to death? That's Hoffman's situation.The plot grows rapidly and it's very convincing. And the ending is the only one possible.Costa-Gavras does a great job with this movie and manages to mantain balance between the characters and the action. Good job. Vote 8 out of 10.

Costa-Gavras has things to say and he does not mince up his message. In `Missing' he succeeded in getting Jack Lemmon to play a convincing role, and in `Mad City' he managed to get John Travolta to carry out the best role I have seen him in his playing of a deranged simple worker real mad at having lost his job is truly memorable. Dustin Hoffman ably supports but without exceeding himself overly.However, rather than the actors in themselves, it is the story itself which is more important and its message getting the story on your TV news programme before your competitors is much more important than any other considerations &#150; such as in this case, a group of schoolchildren held hostage with a shotgun aimed at them. But do not worry about them &#150; get the story live on TV at any price, what a scoop! what a sensation!And thus we live at the dictates of that ogre of communications called TV whether wars in Rwanda or Afghanistan or Palestinians blowing themselves up in Israeli caf√©s or airliners crashing into the WTC, the most important thing is to get it live on screen for the hungry masses. We are at the mercy of papirazzi, that merciless squad of camera-toting fame-seekers, who have no scruples at getting their story first or even inventing it.Thanks for the message, Costa-Gavras I learnt it long ago, but you tell it well.

The media has become an out-of-control circus, I thought to myself. Certainly not an original thought or insight, and not extremely different from many other movies and stories out there with a similar message. The difference with Mad City, though, was that it didn't play this insight for satire or sly comedy. There's an anger and a sadness that runs through the entire movie - a burning regret that this is the way things have to be. The filmmakers could have easily reached for humor or gaudy overstatement to make their points (as was done, say, in Network or Natural Born Killers) but instead they keep most everything at the human level, and that makes all the difference. We come to feel really bad for the Travolta character; the screenwriters' making him such a simpleton is, I'll admit, a bit manipulative, but as manipulations go it's a good one and a smart one - it lets us see the toll in human terms of the media frenzy. Dustin Hoffman and particularly Alan Alda are expert in their roles as media sharks, and the sort of Mutt and Jeff (or perhaps George and Lenny) relationship which Hoffman and Travolta get into here is really marvelous. It has beats of comedy to it, while never being anything less than totally serious (kind of like Hoffman and Cruise in Rain Man - though the film never strains for that connection).I think of this movie often in conjunction with Wag the Dog, Hoffman's other movie that year and for me it's no comparison Wag the Dog is gleefully cynical, seems to take real joy in the media being so ever-present and the audience being so easily conned. For me, that rings as hollow satire; Mad City by truly trying to examine and get us to think about (not just laugh at) the media's power is miles away the better film.

To be honest it doesn't build much suspense. It does, however, have a message about modern society. People have a fascination with crisis situations and media personalities feed on that fact like sharks in a frenzy. That can lead situations to escalate out of control.Dustin Hoffman stole the show as Max Brackett. A fellow viewer couldn't believe that he was the same man that had played in Rainman. He delivers a standout performance as TV news reporter Max Brackett who is looking to inject life back into his career but at the same time retains some sense of compassion and justice. The forces battle inside him through out the film.John Travolta was on the money but not stellar as Sam Bailey, a recently unemployed security guard on the cusp of losing everything that he owns. Sam is a bit of low watt bulb, but he is basically a good person caught up in a very bad choice and situation that runs awry of his plans. He is very distraught about his situation and popping caffiene pills to stay awake doesn't help his state of mind much either. Not one of Travolta's best but it is still good.What a pleasure to watch Alan Alda in front of the camera again. As Kevin Hollander he is the guy that you love to hate. Hollander is Max Brackett's nemesis and antagonist. Alda easily departs from his compassionate portrayal of Dr. Haweye Pierce on TV's MASH for this one.This isn't a perfect film but it is a good one. It will leave you thinking about the message that it has. The acting is good to great.

The Kirk Douglas part has shifted to a television reporter and it's played with relish by Dustin Hoffman. By sheer chance Hoffman is in the Museum Of Natural History when a security guard who's been laid off due to budget cuts, pulls a shotgun out of canvas bag and holds museum director Blythe Danner, a school teacher and her class who were out on a field trip just as the museum is closing. Oh and he accidentally shoots his former co-worker security guard Bill Nunn as well. That kind of seals his fate.As good as Dustin Hoffman is the film really belongs to John Travolta as the desperate security guard, a slow witted kind of man who really hasn't thought through what he's doing. Hoffman realizing he's got an exclusive story becomes Travolta's media adviser, stringing it out for all it's worth. Travolta has to walk a fine line in this film, balancing his character's situation in his portrayal. We empathize with him, many of us who have ever been desperate and without a paycheck, but we can't sympathize with a man who's holding a whole bunch of grade school kids hostage. Sam Bailey ranks as one of the two or three best pieces of work John Travolta has ever done. In the meantime Hoffman who is also mentoring young reporter Mia Kirshner, too well as it turns out, has also got a rivalry with network anchor Alan Alda. One thing I've noticed about Alan Alda, since he's left MASH, he's gone out of his way to take roles that are the farthest thing from good guy Hawkeye Pierce. He and Hoffman hate each other and Alda's attempts to spin the story his way and Hoffman's countermoves are what really set up the inevitable climax.Mad City is not very nice look at the news business and what people will do to get a story. The film has its roots not only in Ace In The Hole and Network, but you could make a case going all the way back to Five Star Final and other films showing the darker side of reporting and the agenda driven people in that business.Sad to say is that the news is business, show business in fact. In the end poor Travolta had to get off the stage.

This film is a biting indictment of the media circus that we look upon as Network and Cable news, and it shows how one story, the story of a simple yet complex man can be manipulated to fit the needs of those manipulating the supposedly objective nature of the news. Mad City shows that there is no such thing as objective reporting, or even loyalty amongst reporters, and that integrity rests with the subjective individualists such as Max Bracket who seem to have the bottom line of a scoop in their best interest, but whose humanness and ethicality cause them to care and empathize with their subjects.

In that sense it is a true satire. Keeping that in mind, the movie is pretty good for a few chuckles. It's certainly a funny movie, but it's not something you can expect huge laughs from.On that note though, it does make you wonder if the events portrayed are really the way things usually go down. The irony is that there are a few big names in the movie who probably get harassed by the same media, possibly in a very similar way.

After all, it features a great direction by Costa-Gavras, good performances (especially from the lead actors), and an interesting plot. So why did it not get something like an 8.0, the grade I voted for the film? It occurs to me that a possible reason for a restrained vote might be that many people are perhaps not ready to admit that what is shown in the film is the naked reality In other words, it is difficult for some to swallow that today the events are not simply portrayed, but are actually shaped by the media, and especially the TV; the news people can make someone a hero, and at the next moment make him a hated man; they can produce a big story out of nothing, and they can sweep a significant event under the carpet without anyone noticing.Costa-Gavras illustrates this vividly in Mad City. Sam (Travolta) has been fired from his job as a security guard in a museum. In desperation, he goes to his employer armed with a gun and explosives, trying to make a pointless request to have his job back. However, things get out of hand as he accidentally shoots a former colleague, and he decides to take some kids hostage. The above events unfold in front of the eyes of Max (Hoffman), a TV reporter whose career has flopped, who happens to be there. Max immediately takes advantage of his golden opportunity, and gets the scoop. Sam follows Max's directions, and the media industry gradually shapes the developments of the saga, with the authorities mainly watching rather than influencing the events.It may sound exaggerated, but sadly this is how things work today. Publicity is everything, and criminals of all stripes, from naive types such as Sam, to sinister ones, want to use media to convey their message through their deplorable acts; media people, from their side, mainly care to get high ratings, and hence try to exploit such situations towards their own advantage, not the advantage of the general public. The result is ugly, and the few exceptions simply confirm the rule.Costa-Gavras has done a great job in portraying this problem through this fictional, yet interesting story. Both Hoffman and Travolta are very convincing in their roles, the first as the ruthless journalist who starts to see the light, and the second as the confused, victim-cum-criminal.I believe Mad City is a movie that one has to view with an open mind. If this happens, you will never watch the 8 o' clock news in the same angle as before... 8/10.

It could put him back with big runners, where years prior, he had a falling out with big wig reporter (Alda) who returns, stealing the story, and manipulating the truth.

It's such a tired and real tale, and makes this film more potent. Hoffman is in top form, where I'm really glad he did it, where him and J.T. make a great team, and I really liked the friendship that formed here. It really added something special to this film. Performances are good all around, Danner especially, as the bitter old museum director. Although Mad City missed a cinema release, where the poster was put up, it's one I'm glad I caught.

Hoffman is as reliable as you'd expect as the reporter who manipulates the situation up help revive his career. But Travolta is the star here, his likable, every man who is down on his luck has you rooting for him, despite the fact that he is holding children hostage at gunpoint. Given the talent on show I'm surprised this failed to find an audience.

It's a social satire about the media's role in the death of a museum security guard (John Travolta). He just wants his job back after being fired, but is quickly turned into a love/hate figure by the TV and radio stations. What he thought was going to be a simple case of threatening his old boss with a gun to achieve his aims, quickly escalates into a hostage situation... As he unwittingly takes a party of children prisoner and the cameras and police cars end up parked outside. Because of the guy's lack of intelligence, he doesn't have a clue what he's doing, or how to get out of it.Fear ye not though, as a fallen reporter (Dustin Hoffman) happened to be in the museum bathroom at the time, and becomes part of the crisis. Seeing this as a chance to get back into the big leagues, he manipulates Travolta into maximising his own publicity... and this average Joe starts striking a chord with the American public everywhere when he start broadcasting his tales of woe. However, the audience's affections are notoriously fickle, and further revelations could jeopardise his newfound fame...You have vendors outside selling commemorative T-shirts, and the cops refusing to charge in until they see the latest opinion polls for this dude. Hence the title, Mad City. Even the sanest lose their head in such heated circumstances, and fanned by the flames of saturation coverage, EVERYONE has an opinion. But I seem to remember this type of story being done with a lot more authenticity and panache in Dog Day Afternoon. That movie explored issues which Mad City wouldn't even touch, and a much more credible set-up too.This one starts off well, but becomes more cartoon-like as it goes along. Travolta and Hoffman's partnership never really gels, and the latter's heel face-turn two thirds of the way through with little provocation seems implausible to say the least. It's a very basic, bare-bones version of a fascinating concept, and can only be recommended to those who couldn't deal with the complexities that are apparent in features of a similar ilk.One of which is apparently called Ace In The Hole. Guess what I'll be watching next... 5/10 "},{"Title":"excellent media frenzy film","Date":"22 September 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" The thought of prison terrifies him, give him some television it'll calm him down.This brilliant film took me by surprise in many ways. First and foremost is John Travolta's excellent against-type performance as Sam, a simple, impulsive security guard who makes the stupid mistake of trying to get his job back with a shotgun. What is his plan? God knows. But he quickly becomes part of the plan of a disgraced reporter (Dustin Hoffman; excellent) to get back on top with a great story. Unfortunately for Sam there's a school trip arranged for the day he decides to wave a shotgun around to get his job back, and he accidentally shoots his fellow security guard Cliff when he jerks the gun to the side, creating a hostage situation. This man could not possibly be more unfortunate, and that gives Max Brackett a window of opportunity to play to the public and tell the story to make his career. So he manipulates Sam into playing for the public and gaining sympathy, and Sam becomes a symbol of the everyman in the eyes of the public. This film is both blackly funny and deeply disturbing, not least in it's portrayal of the intrusiveness of news people and widespread effect of the media and how it sways and is swayed by public opinion. As the film progresses it all starts to look like some vicious gamble that can backfire on it's players and leave people destroyed. It becomes nothing more than a hopeless situation, and the final crane shot at the end of Max Brackett bloodied and being swarmed by reporters almost reminds of that shot in The Wild Bunch of the red ants swarming the scorpions.So I was really impressed with this film. The message is obvious but it never gets annoying. The ensemble cast is excellent all round, Hoffman goes from cunning and arrogant to disillusioned and finally helpless, Alan Alda, that guy from M.A.S.H. is excellent and convincing as a popular news anchor, and Mia Kirshner turns quickly from being a naive intern reporter to a parasite. But it's Travolta that really steals this show. I'd forgotten just how good of an actor he is. Despite his distinct and recognisable appearance, he played completely against type and totally inhabited the character.This film really hit me, I'd highly recommend it.

The situation that is presented in the film is intense and quite fascinating, although it does turn a bit too much towards spectacle in the final third of the film. The politics - the ethics and rivalry for ratings - at hand are very interesting, and the film raises a number of thought provoking ideas. Hoffman is superb as the news reporter struggling for a good story, and Alda plays his rival with the exact amount of cynicism required for the part. It is a bit hectic, and the directing work tends to rely on clich√©s, plus the messages are ultimately pushed a little far in that they becoming numbing, but there are quite a few virtues to make up for possible shortcomings. The editing, with transitions between television sets, provides an interesting feel, and Thomas Newman has composed some interesting music for the material. While not the best film out there, nor even the best media satire, it is surprising that this film has not received a warmer reception. It might not be perfect, but it certainly deserves some attention.

John Travolta plays a fired security who held several kids and a museum director (Blythe Danner) as hostages simply because he wanted his job back. Max Brackett, the reporter, was there doing a small report about the place when everything started right on his front. Here stars the story of Mad City and some ponderations on the media role and the ones who watch it, which means, us!Wisely translated in Portuguese as The Fourth Power the film directed by Costa Gavras (Missing, Z) is satirical without being extremely funny or ridiculous; dramatical without becoming melodramatic; and controversial without being too shocking; criticizes but not that much, pointing its fingers on the media blaming it for being irresponsible and unethical, but where's the criticism towards audiences of this fourth power? Everybody (or almost everybody because every unanimity is dumb) loves sensationalistic journalism and its wide coverage of pointless subjects, sometimes very relevant news. People are very hunger for that and most of the time they don't even care if a sensational news story is true or false. And the media, in countries where it is the fourth power (behind the legislative, executive and judiciary) takes advantage of that, fooling people (but only the ones who want to be fooled or are too ignorant to have a better perspective). So in the film Brackett gets his lesson at the end, but what about the viewers? Most of them didn't get it all, that's why this film is bad criticized and barely heard. And how come a movie that attacks the whole media and press can be well judged or be a box-office hit? People are blind to these things. But when you have masterpieces like Network or Ace in the Hole this film pales a little in comparison.It might not have the same ferocity and originality as his works but it is a great work directed by Costa Gavras, with a great screenplay, nice music and fine acting by Hoffman (who now disowned the film in interviews calling of something I can post here referring to the word City, yes, he does that with what he calls his bad films, go figure!), Travolta, Blythe Danner, Alan Alda, Ted Levine, Raymond J. Barry, William Atherton, Robert Prosky, Mia Kershner and Bill Nunn. I like this film a lot, it should have a larger audience to it, but it looks like it will be almost impossible to bring more attention to it, or a reevaluation by film buff's, critics and others.

Then, as one gets older, re-watching the movie isn't quite the same if it isn't, well, very good. And yet even as Mad City isn't something I'd say to a friend watch this right away, it'll change your life (that, of course, from Costa-Gravas, would be Z), it's definitely a good view for something on a lazy day or night, or for a minor Dustin Hoffman or (yes) John Travolta craving. It does happen from time to time.The two stars are in very fine shape here- as far as the script can let them be- as a clear-headed but desperate reporter and a security guard with a heap of bad trouble respectively, who are put into an unintentional hostage situation after Travolta's recently fired museum security guard accidentally shoots a fellow guard and has to hold up a bunch of kids who are in the museum (plus Hoffman, in the bathroom after a boring interview while this happens), and then it turns into a media blitz. When these two actors interact the way they do, or even go through their somewhat predictable motions, it works at the least because we get to see Hoffman and Travolta as characters they've worked out and almost perfected in their own way. We believe them in this situation, and that should be enough to make it at least compelling viewing....Except, unfortunately, for a preachy screenplay, which half the time is simplistic tabloid entertainment and the other half dogmatic about the nature of the media. Costa-Gravas tries for moments that go for the satirical (one of my favorite bits is when we see the shot security guard recovering in his hospital room, waking up the first time to see a giant camera crane rising outside of his window to get his reaction to seeing a giant camera crane from a news group). It's definitely 20 years too late Network got their first, quicker, brighter, funnier, and even with some better action. Perhaps there would have been more possibilities if the movie had been made today, when cable news is even more saturated with BS filler, one analysis to the next taking up time from actual other news that could be reported.But, for complaints that can be had with Mad City, and there are more than a few, it's surely watchable Hollywood stuff, and this is thanks to the direction (I really liked the tension when Travolta is telling the kids the Indian ghost story in front of the display in the museum), and a nice roster of supporting/character actors. If you've never seen a Dustin Hoffman or John Travolta movie before, by all means look elsewhere. But if you got nothing better to do, it isn't bad.

Sam Baily is an uneducated man whose goals have been frustrated due to the lack of a post-high school education.

First there's Travolta's performance. He played his character way too dumb. I bet he wishes he could take this one back. There are the idiotic lines of dialogue sprinkled throughout the film. For example, when Travolta's wife is watching the reporters outside her own house right after finding out about her husband holding hostages, she says, Look, now they're standing in my flower bed! That's it! She's more upset about her flowers than about her husband holding hostages. And when Travolta is giving his first TV interview and says something about going to church, one of the kids he's holding hostages say, I go to church too, with my family. What's the point of that, except to hit us over the heads with how Travolta is an 'ordinary guy' and is getting people's sympathy through the interview. The worst thing of all however is how utterly stupid the story is. First, the kids who are being held hostage over several days act more like their at summer camp then being kidnapped by a gun-wielding nut. They laugh and play with Travolta, they listen to him tell stories, and when he once in a while goes nuts and starts firing his gun out the window, they forget all about it when he opens up the candy machine for them. Real kids in a situation like this would be terrified. Then there are the people outside who start calling him a hero and printing up T-shirts with his face on it after his interview. Sympathy is one thing, that's understandable, but is anyone actually going to call a guy holding kids hostage a hero? And then there's the media. Everytime someone walks out the front door of the museum, whether its Hoffman or one of the kids, they get rushed by this media mob. The police would've barricaded the place, and the reporter's wouldn't be able to get within a hundred yards of that door. This movie is bad, some of it laughably bad, but mostly just plain bad.

The news story? A recently laid-off security guard returns to the museum at which he worked in an attempt to get his job back. When his former boss (the unsubtly named Mrs Banks) refuses his demands, the security guard goes berserk and holds the entire museum, which is filled with school children, hostage. The film is derivative of Lumet's Dog Day Afternoon and Network, Billy Wilder's Ace in the Hole and William Wellman's Magic Town, but nevertheless goes in some interesting directions. For example, the film uses the Natural History Museum in an ironic fashion, the world of history bulldozed by media, America a soul deadened prison reliant on sensationalized news stories and a constant trickle of crass reports to drum up excitement. The kids held hostage are themselves unfazed, their lives a gun filled television show even before the news vans pulled up.6.5/10 &#x96; All of Costa Gavras' Hollywood films are weaker than his foreign language films, but this one is the weakest. Overlong, and badly acted, Mad City nevertheless manages to be at once dumber and more complex than its generally given credit. I attribute this paradox to magic.

Every role is well-cast, and neither lead outshine their character(rather, they disappear nicely into the roles). It's engaging, and it comes across rather credible and psychologically accurate. The production is not flashy, nor does this feel thrown together. Editing and cinematography are good. It's genuinely funny, here and there. The pacing is great, and this doesn't really lose your interest, as such. Heck, the children aren't even particularly irritating. So why do I give it that relatively low of a vote? Well, frankly, it seems to put forth all it really has to say within the first fifteen to twenty minutes, and after that, it simply keeps restating it, occasionally in a different way than earlier in the movie. The one message that this contains is that the press can and will blow things out of proportion, and manipulate facts as well as those who follow them in order to stay informed. As admirable as it is to make an effort to ensure that everyone is aware of that sad truth, don't we all already know that? If this would at least explore it, go into what has led to it, and what makes people go along with it, it would quite possibly make for excellent cinema. As it is, this honestly winds up being a one-sided attempt at convincing its audience that things are a certain way, no matter what else they might believe, which is, ironically, exactly like the type of news-reporting that it is trying to decry. While 15 Minutes wasn't a masterpiece, it at least had satire, and was more entertaining than this. There is some violence and brief language in this. I recommend this to the biggest fans of those who made it. 6/10 "},{"Title":"thank God that we live in a country where one can use the media to do anything","Date":"16 April 2006","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" Taking a break from handsome roles, John Travolta plays Sam Baily, hijacking a museum to demand his job back.

Yes, that's what I've been talking all the time! But, retrospectively, it still isn't something very new. We've seen it very long ago, Kirk Douglas opened our eyes is Ace in the Hole, Cary Grant made us laugh even before in His girl Friday, Walter Matthau & Jack Lemmon repeated it decades later in The Front Page. But for most of us the lesson hasn't been learned. We had to be punched in our heads by washing our brains by soap operas and soap news. We had to see billions of people losing attitudes (if ever had any) and accepting as truth whatever the Holy Box in living-room said the truth was. We had to see wars starting and finishing when the Holy Box told its believers to go to the war or to press the government to stop it. We had to see president elections (or nominations) lost because some camera happened to be on a wrong or (right?) place. We had to see politicians', actors', musicians', army officers' careers end because their words were taken from the interviews just to sound sensational (oh, yes, the law gave them a chance to correct, but if anybody read it later, nobody believed it). We had to see instant stars (musicians, politicians...) raise from TV shows becoming as successful as the TV marketing wanted them to be, and lasting as long as TV wanted. One wrong sentence said, one wrong person talking to, one wrong place to spend a night at, one drink to much, there's always a camera to record it and make it a line on the bottom of a page or a top sensation, depending on the ranking of the person caught. Throughout the history power changed its owner magicians, kings, priests, generals... Now it's definitely press (mostly TV) holding it. Even bigger power than ever they don't only control the present, they change history and make future (read Orwell). And as they control the informations, they can prevent any different opinions to be publicly spoken (how long will these web forums exist?). Even if you're one of them, you'll be stopped (by the way, would Hoffmann in the last scene shout so loudly if he wasn't pushed out of the system?)Few decades ago Gavras was a socialist regimes pet. His movies were praised and repeatedly shown in cinemas and on TV. His criticism was usually against rightists and USA, so it was politically correct to watch his movies, which always had wide open message. In this movie a message is here, but almost eaten by two fantastic actors in one of their best roles. Travolta looks only few I.Q.s over Forrest Gump? Yes, if not so, would he take a bag of dynamite without a plan? Hoffmann looks sleepy and slow? Yes, his career is in a dead end street on the start, and he is physically exhausted at the end (Travolta takes pills, and Hoffmann is awaken all the time trying to control people and events as he is used to being a reporter - how should he look like?). But it's Alda who saves the movie not to become a two actors competition (like The Sleuth - but that magnificent movie was meant to be a actors-movie, and Mad City is supposed to be a message-movie).Now we have someone to hate. But I still feel uncomfortable it looks like we have to like the man who walks with gun and explosives. Is he a good guy for today standards? Or a relict from Gavras' early days (the lefts he glorified were also the Red brigades and R.A.F.)? Or, maybe Gavras, leaving Europe to make Hollywood movies, accepted US free arms for everybody standards? Any of that correct, he lost a credibility to judge anyone (even TV). Let's repeat the lessons Douglas and Grant tried to teach us!

The basic premise of the film was conceptualized during the zenith of the mass media's coverage of the O.J. Simpson trial. It provides a nice critique of the media's agenda in covering the news. Travolta's character provides the dramatic impetus to advance the critique. While promoting another film in later years, Hoffman conceded that in his opinion Mad City was a bomb.

The story is way too blatant and extreme; Costa-Gavras apparently decided to make his point, if it can be said there is one, with the bludgeon, not the rapier. The film is technically well put together, but that does not save it or even capture one's interest.  It is up to the performers to do that, and here again, the film fails.  Travolta, who we know is capable of better, is neither engaging or believable (he comes off as almost retarded).  The role was done much better by Denzel Washington in John Q.Faring a bit better is Alan Alda, playing Hawkeye Pierce all grown up and jaded.Hoffman is masterful and is the only reason I rated this a 2 instead of a 1 (awful).  He is smooth and professional and almost makes you want to try to like the movie.  But, alas, he cannot do it alone.  The casting of the featured players in roles we have seen them in before is just more evidence that Costa-Gavras slept through this one. You would do better to sleep through it, also.

Each of these political hot potatoes start with a worthwhile cause, but ineptitude in writing and direction ruins all 3 pictures. Medical bureaucracy and the death penalty were the subjects of 'John Q' and 'The Life Of David Gale', respectively. Since the issues of the blood-thirsty media and the plight of the blue-collar workforce are not quite as pressing as saving lives OR taking lives, 'Mad City' starts out a notch below right out of the gate. Truly, the notion that television stations will crush anybody for ratings (including inflating an event into a circus) is old, old news. Less than an hour into this movie, my eyes were starting to roll.Director Costa-Gavras must be the chief culprit for this mess. I kept thinking that it would only take a gentle nudge to turn this into a parody. There's a real problem with tone, and that can only be blamed on the director. Why did he and John Travolta think it was a good idea to make Travolta's character such an idiot? The man is just a few IQ points above Forrest Gump. I would have preferred if he had played it the way he played George in 'Phenomenon'. Instead, he's too much of an unprepared fool to be capable of holding a museum full of kids hostage for days on end. He may be likable, but he's still a criminal.Dustin Hoffman plays the one-time superstar reporter who stumbles upon this story and proceeds to gain Travolta's confidence---even managing to leave the secured museum whenever he pleases. Even though he has several opportunities to end the siege (including 2 or 3 chances to grab the shotgun), he would rather keep the story going and pretend to be trying to help Travolta. Scenes like these come within an eyelash of a Marx Brothers routine, so how can anybody take the movie seriously? The two superstars work together about as well as they can, although Hoffman's manipulative monotone grows tiresome quickly.I always have a hard time excusing a character who victimizes innocent people and creates a dangerous mess just because he's lost his job or because he's hurting. The middle and lower classes ARE being creamed by the rich and thoughtless (and it's often the media who swoop in to profit from the misery), but these films I've mentioned make me want to root against the underdog. Blowing up buildings and taking hostages is a terrorist act. Cripes, 'Mad City' has probably got most viewers on its side right from the start. Most of us think the media are scumbags and many of us can relate to losing the only crummy job we could get. Squandering my good will with bad direction, weak writing, and insufficient performances is what's maddening about this dud called 'Mad City'.
