This is not the comic food we have grown up on. It is a different cuisine that tastes strange at first, but if given a chance, rewards with fresh, delicious sensations at every bite.Early in this movie our actor heros take turns mugging an emotion on command. I think this moment is the key to understanding the entire film. Almost every scene is painted by facial expressions and body language. The editing lingers to give us time to enjoy each portrait, then cuts a bit further along in the story than we are used to.  This unfamiliar timing gives the strong cast a chance to act rather than react.  The story is about actors, but the movie is a tribute to comedic acting.If you want a formula comedy, rent something else. If you want movie that is funny, warm, original, and brilliant and are willing to give its different pace a chance, put this film at the top of your list and plan to view it twice.

I once heard someone say that door-slamming farcical comedy never works on film; and I think this is one of the movies that proves them wrong. It reminded me of the brilliant stage farce Noises Off (which was also turned into a movie with fairly successful results).I thought the opening title gags were brilliant, especially Oliver Platt. I loved Billy Connolly as a camp tennis player and Allison Janney as a gangster's moll. I also thought Alfred Molina, Tony Shalhoub, Campbell Scott, Steve Buscemi and Matt McGrath were brilliant as well. The pastry shop scene and Tucci crying poor were also outstanding highlights.My only slight criticism with this film is that the pacing seemed a tiny bit slow at times, but otherwise this is an exceptional storyline. This is definitely the sort of movie I'd like to see a lot more of. It also proves that they CAN make 'em like they used to.

This rollicking screwball comedy follows two dedicated but starving actor pals (Tucci and Oliver Platt) on their increasingly nutty adventures in 1930s NYC and aboard an ocean liner. The all-star indie film cast includes many of Tucci's co-stars from BIG NIGHT (including BN co-director Campbell Scott as the cruise's officious German director), many of them in change-of-pace roles. For example, it was a delight to see Lili Taylor get to exercise her flair for comedy as the pretty, plucky activities director being romantically pursued by both Scott and Matt McGrath.  Although many have compared THE IMPOSTORS to Laurel and Hardy, I think its sophisticated air and sly playfulness make it more like Woody Allen meets The Marx Brothers.

Stanley Tucci directs the new comedy, who is one of the creators of the 1995 drama-comedy Big Night. The film is certainly not for everyone. It will satisfy fans of screwball comedies, and perhaps fans of someone in the cast-they may enjoy it. However, I only liked The Impostors because of the laughs it brought along with its well-written script. It is not your typical comedy. Now, I'm not saying that this movie is great. I am saying, however, that this movie satisfied me to the point of a recommendation.  	The Impostors opens with a hilarious sequence in which the two main stars, Tucci and Platt, play two out of work actors, Maurice & Arthur, who play on a silent stage who have serious and comical problems with women, coffee, and each other. Maurice & Arthur get in to trouble and escape from the police in a boarding box. However, while they were sleeping, the box was loaded onto a ship carrying an assortment of bizarre passengers that provoke even more laughs. They include a Nazi steward with tight lips, Lily, the social director who helps Maurice & Arthur, a First Mate who is a mad bomber, a tennis pro who is aggressively gay, an ex-queen  in despair entertainer who wants to commit suicide, and many more. 	The films casting was more to my liking than any other movie I have seen this year. The characters fit the actors so perfectly and realistically that I could have been fooled that these people were actually victims of a secret tapping of  Candid Camera. Each of them bring a story to themselves outside the plot. No one character is at the mercy of the script.As for the script itself, it kept its cool even as it organized its own extremely complicated chaos. There are many laughs that evolve from hyperactive activity from the assortment of characters because there is such a variety, everything feels so fresh in this movie. The Impostors is an opinion based movie. Certain film's don't carry massive plot holes, obvious flaws, or any other structural or character problem, but they don't necessarily bring anything overwhelmingly powerful to the big screen either. The Impostors is this kind of comedy. Whether you find it to your liking or not will totally depend on your taste in comic material in film. I was amused by the picture. Many filmgoers will differ on my opinion though. The individual I screened the film longed for its conclusion and declared this was the worst movie she had seen in her life. I recommend the film, but take into account your personal feelings on my review before you make a judgment call. The Impostors might make you laugh uncontrollably, but it also may cause you  to turn your head in pitiful despise. Brought to you by Fox Searchlight Pictures.

Its theatrical hammery can be absurdly precious, its attempts at slapstick bungled, its comic situations tortuously contrived.  The film proclaims itself as a farce, and yet the mechanics aren't tight enough (a hint of studio interference?); too many characters and situations are introduced at convenient moments to sustain farce's exquisite suspense, surprise and inevitability.  An air of complacent superiority breezes through the whole thing.I loved it.  The film it most reminded me of, despite its echoes of Beckett, silent comedy and 'Bullets over Broadway', was 'Topsy-Turvy'.  There is the same fruity dialogue and opportunity for ostentatious thesping.  The theatrical milieu allows for a suspension of realism - like Leigh's film, there is no attempt to faithfully recreate the period; rather 'The Impostors' is like a play of the period, filmed against a flat background with appropriate signifiers (clothes, music etc.).  This idea that the narrative is not 'real' (ie as a narrative) is suggested by the closing revelation of the movie set, removing a plot full of people playing other people to another level.Of course, this kind of closing self-reflexivity, this shattering of illusions, is pure Fellini, and the ship setting reminds us surely of 'Ship Of Fools', that ironically melancholy portrait of a doomed society. 'Impostors', despite the final burst of the carnivalesque, is too controlled to be a Felliniesque extravaganza; too in thrall to the idea of plot, and the way plot reflects the metaphysics of action; but there is a variety of character; an impulse towards mocking melodrama and the picaresque; a feel for the grotesque and chaotic, a sheer love of role-playing and transformation, that Il Maestro would possibly have enjoyed.It would be reading too much into 'Impostors' to see the ship and its passengers, travelling from Prohibition America to Paris as in any way allegorical - the characters and situations are pure stage types - the impoverished gold-digging mother, the suicidal divorcee, the deposed Ruritanian queen, the Teutonic manager, the kamikaze revolutionary, the lovesick captain.  I don't think they are used to explore a particular political viewpoint or historical interpretation - rather, they allow for a wide-ranging analysis of the conflict between acting and role.The film's impulse is to mock even it's own plot, so that resolution is hardly a morally satisfactory dividing of the spoils.  The impostors are shown to reveal the wider imposture going on in all levels of society - acting can both expose the fraudulence and help the miserable and betrayed. They move from being outsiders desperate for recognition from society to critics and exposers of society - typically, they save it and are absorbed by it.  The film begins with them disrupting reality with their false cafe melodramatics; it ends with them saving marriages, foiling revolution. Acting, once it's recognised as acting, is neutered.There are three great pleasures in 'Impostors'.  First is the acting. Stanley Tucci and Oliver Platt are an adorable couple, part Vladimir and Estragon, part Laurel and Hardy (and Beckett was profoundly influenced by silent comedy) - their attempts at acting only further revealing their characters.  The post-theory sexualising of the likes of Laurel and Hardy is intimated here - the impostors share a bedroom; they are constantly confronted with aggressive male sexuality; they are never considered as a heterosexual threat - but, appropriately to the period, this is never brought to the surface.They have some great set-pieces, particularly in the first half (the cakeshop; the denunciation of Jeremy in the pub); their wordy dialogue is deliciously appropriate; their mixture of deadpan and ham a treat.  Not all of the cameos come off, but Campbell Scott's absurd manager and Alfred Molina's blustery bad actor are a hoot (is the Hamlet he plays a defining spirit of the film, the anguish over whether to act and be appropriated or interpret and remain free (and hungry)?).Secondly, the filming.  Although most of 'Impostors' is pure farce (and there is far too little of THAT in the cinema nowadays), there is nothing stagy about it.  The prologue is shot as delightful silent slapstick, and the smooth shooting is often broken by moments of disruptive handheld immediacy which provide some lovely epiphanies.  The repetition of key scenes and moments (eg all the characters staring into the round, porthole -like mirrors) are expertly done.Best of all is the insanely inventive score, beautifully appropriate to the period, a pastiche of salon, jazz and tango that is witty but also emotionally revealing, creating a real sense of romance and nostalgia, while silly post-modern things are going on on screen.

They're accused of assaulting a snobbish Ham actor, and after finding a place to hide they discover they're actually on a ship with him. At this point the blandness comes to a halt, and resumes to inanity and effortless skits.

Bertrom immediately inflates the episode as an attempt on his life, initiating a chase by the authorities, the unfortunate pair ultimately hiding in a crate on a dock. They fall asleep, finding the next morning that they have been loaded aboard a luxury liner, making them inadvertent stowaways. As luck, and admittedly ham-handed writing would have it, Bertrom has booked passage on the same ship, where he hopes that The salt air will heal my wounds, and the motion of the cool, green sea will soothe my tortured soul.Arthur and Maurice's presence on the ship is soon found out, and with the help of sympathetic cruise director Lily, played by Lili Taylor, disguise themselves as stewards and manage through luck and mayhem to stay just ahead of Bertrom, Meistrich, the severely Prussian head steward, hysterically played by Campbell Scott, and the gentle, mild mannered Marco who is charged by Meistrich to apprehend the stowaways. In the process, the duo learn that the first mate, played by Tony Shalhoub, is in fact a terrorist cum freedom fighter of an obscure and unnamed country who plans to blow up the ship, and that an American couple, Johnny and Maxine, thieves masquerading as Parisians, are planning to seduce and murder a wealthy widow and an Arab Sheik, respectively.Set sometime in the 1930's, the tone feels decidedly European, with European sensibilities. There is elegance here, within the confines of a limited budget. There are tuxes and flower arrangements galore, but this ain't Titanic. That said, the production design pokes fun at itself in that the bulk of the movie is shot on a static ship-board set that does not resort to the use of fancy lighting, gimbals, or even water, and in place of a green screen uses a cheap, to hell with 'em if they can't take a joke painted backdrop. The pace is quick and frenetic, energized by the extensive use of hand-held camera work. The acting, for its part, is poured not into characters per se but joyfully and unabashedly into cartoon-like characterizations. And this is not the hallmark of bad acting as some would suggest, for the writing allows the actors free rein to deliver in places great monologues, in the way jazz artists are given, each in turn, an opportunity to display their virtuosity in their solo performances. I would suggest that it takes great skill to flesh out such vivid and flamboyant personages.This movie would best be described as a gag movie, in that it has the appearance of a string of set-piece gags that are carefully set up and sprung on the viewer. And, if the art of humor lies with the delivery, than the delivery here is top-notch, with great lines joyfully delivered by over-the-top characters. It should be noted that in the hands of lesser talent, lines such as Meistrich The danger of the chase has made you perspire. It has made me also&#x85;moist. Maxine What are we gonna do with all that cash, Johnny? Johnny What do you think, baby? Maxine Take it on the lam and scram to some far-off land and lead a life of bliss, Johnny? Would fall flat and strike the ear as crushingly hokey. It takes real chops to make material like this work.And the delivery isn't made up just in the acting. The camera has an active part in selling the lines, also. To illustrate, Marco and Lili are romantically involved, but Meistrich, who is infatuated with Lili, repeatedly tries to insinuate himself in every private moment the couple manages together, the camera drawing away abruptly and without warning at such times from an intimate two shot to a three shot, revealing the intruder Meistrich. The music helps establish the mindset in the viewer also, alternating between delightfully continental Tango music to breezy and raucous Dixieland.And though this is most assuredly a gag movie, the bits are not just strewn helter-skelter against a vapid storyline. All the jokes become glittering sequins on a lovingly woven and coherent fabric of plot. It hangs together very nicely, thank you. However, it should be noted that not all the gags work, however. The sheer volume of them and the variability of taste in movie-goers would decree that at least some fall flat, and for this reviewer that is the case, but many more are delightful, and more than make up for the klunkers. So why didn't this do better at the box office? And why does it have a ranking of 6.0 on IMDb? It isn't for the craftsmanship; technically, the directing is first-rate, the writing also, the acting top-notch, and the soundtrack is superb. So the problem is that of taste. For any one individual, that person's taste will decree that they are either going to like this movie or they won't. I know folks who, to their credit, have tried to watch Monty Python and the Holy Grail several times and still can't see the funny in it that tickles others. For myself, this one is a gentle, joyful froth that does not concern itself with heady examinations of the human condition or the subconscious. Rather, it is cinematic playfulness, perfect for distracting me at least temporarily from the burden of seriousness that life imposes.

We watch them slip in and out of a panoply of roles.  Yes, the film spoofs various other films, and yes, the plot is simple and annoyingly hurried near the end, but it all serves as a set-up for the actors to test their hand at what appear to be impromptu role changes, some of which (above all the death scenes) they practice a variety of times before perfecting.  I won't attempt to count the number of impostors in this film - any more than I would think to count the number of acts in a variety show.I have watched this film three times and find myself liking it more each time.  Again, my enjoyment derives not from the story, or dramatic tension, but from sharing what must have been exhilarating moments for all the actor-impostors in the cast.Note that much - if not all - of the story plays out on sets, most of all an ocean liner with beautifully painted sea and cloudscape behind.  Indeed, throughout there is a curious interplay between the theater stage feel of certain scenes (above all those outdoors) and the comparative trompe l'oeil of the interiors.Again and again, the main characters need introduce themselves to others and do so in confused, embarrassed and somewhat defeatist fashion, explaining, No, no, you wouldn't have seen us in any films...  We're sort of in the theater, you see... but it's very difficult, you know, with the cards stacked against us... - accenting the intent of this film.  It's a stage actors' romp, and, as said, I like it more and more.  I also enjoy the handling of sex in this film - much as treated under the Bros. Marx or Charlie Chaplin - more truly adult than what's typical for Hollywood's often juvenile or pathetic, show-all personality cult figures.

The writing and direction are reminiscent of a continental movie, with the director (Tucci) owing a debt more to films like Waking Ned and other similar 'gentle' films than the zany antics of Airplane or The Naked Gun. Yet there is a lot of original and self-referential humour in here, too, with one of the best moments a scene where one of the characters finds out what a foreign character is saying by reading the subtitles! The setting, apparently the 1920s or 30s, is perfectly captured, yet when the two leads are on board the ship there is little attempt made to disguise the fact that this is a movie set. This is taken to the extreme during the closing credits&#133; A real diamond of a movie that stands out from the crowd - but lovers of fast-paced action/sex comedies may be advised to rent There's Something About Mary again&#133; (Personally, I'm going to track down a copy of Tucci's first film as writer/director, Big Night).

It's an ensemble comedy, an homage of sorts to the screwball comedy of the 20's and 30's, but intelligent and accessible and above all, great loads of fun.  All the faces are familiar and all the performances are great.  The  best part is the palpable sense of fun that all the actors exude as they work.

The production design by Andrew Jackness and the costumes by Juliet Polcsa are delicious.  I did spend too much time trying to figure out approximately what year the film is set in (and settled on the late 20's right before Prohibition) but maybe that is just my problem.  Interestingly, a man named Andrei Belgrader is credited as artistic consultant. The 20's, 30's, and 40's are sort of back in the public eye again with the resurgence of swing and the accompanying dropped hems and dropped stocks, but this production is more concerned with the graceful beauty and naivete of the times rather than the fashion and the politics.  The cartoonish situations that comedic leads found themselves in at that point in cinema are revisited and I am afraid that people will fail to recognize that, instead watching the movie in a modern context. As with Big Night, the music is constant and mood-enhancing (maybe not at the ball...) and I must find the soundtrack!  It's broad, it's a little theatrical, but it's also very tight and very high energy.  Almost nothing is sacrificed to low or cheap humor.  Scott is particularly cast against type (and maybe channeling the glorious character actors from back in the day) and a wild giggle.  Platt and Tucci make a surprising pair on screen. The silent movie style opening sequence is just as natural as their possible siblinghood.

For those who stick with it, the finale is admittedly terrific. ** from **** "},{"Title":"One of the best!","Date":"30 June 2005","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" I thought that the movie was fantastic .

The characters and plot both exist for one reason to make the audience laugh. Films like The Naked Gun and Austin Powers were of this genre, and worked for one reason they delivered the laughs. Plot development and sophisticated dialogue play no part in this type of comedy, so if the film isn't funny, there is nothing to fall back on. In this way, a movie like The Impostors must be funny throughout in order to distract the viewer from the silliness of the plot and characters.The Impostors both fails and succeeds in this way; some parts are as hilarious as they are meant to be, while other parts leave the audience shifting in their seats. The unfunny scenes seem to carry on and on, giving the viewer time notice just how silly the film really is. This turns out to be one of the movies biggest problems.Other films of this nature combat this problem by firing the jokes off one after another, so that if one joke bombs there is another to take its place. The Impostors needed to utilize this technique more. This is not to say that the film was a dud.  Many scenes and characters are very funny, but the bad ones tended to be very noticeable.The Impostors revolves around Maurice and Arthur, two veteran actors in Depression-era New York, trying to earn a living through acting. Parts are scarce though, and the two spend their days honing their skills by acting out 'scenes' with made up characters on the unsuspecting public. After a wild chain of events, Maurice and Arthur end up as hunted stowaways on an ocean liner headed to Paris, where they become entangled in the lives of the other quirky passengers.The Impostors has the feel of a silent movie; every gesture, facial expression, and action seems to be exaggerated for comedic effect.  Many of the scenes would be funny even without the dialogue. Slapstick humour runs throughout the movie creating that silent movie feel. The Impostors plays out like Saturday Night Live sketches pieced together to form a plot. This method has funny results, but when one 'sketch' fails the whole movie suffers.Maurice and Arthur are played wonderfully by Oliver Platt and Stanley Tucci, respectively. The two characters weasel their way into the hearts of the viewers from the very beginning, just as characters in a good buddy movie should. Platt and Tucci's relationship is based on a Laurel and Hardy model, or for a modern reference, David Spade and Chris Farley. There are other great performances from characters on the ship. The Impostors has a good cast with Woody Allen, Steve Buscemi, Lili Taylor, and Isabella Rossellini in small, one dimensional roles. The funniest performance by far is Campbell Scott in his role as Meistrich, the German ship director. Meistrich comes complete with a monocle, a scar, a thick German accent and the attitude of World War Two General. When he is not hunting down the stowaways (Maurice and Arthur) his is trying to win over Lili Taylor's character, Lilly, with hilarious results.The Impostors concludes with the cast suddenly dancing joyously off the set and around the studio where the filming took place. Obviously the actors enjoyed making the movie; the performances during the film and the dancing afterward attest to this. In fact, it seems they had more fun making the movie than audiences will have watching it. The Impostors makes a good effort, but in the end it isn't quite funny enough to pull the whole thing off.

Isn't that a little slow? the band leader asks.That scene pretty much sums up this movie Great performers get on screen and you expect a fast-paced, fun time, but instead get a slow, slow movie.Who to blame? I'm going to have to go with Stanley Tucci. I like Stanley Tucci, but I don't think he's very funny. He plays half of the the film's title duo, and he's teamed with the hilarious Oliver Platt. Platt is great, likable, and funny. Tucci is not. His character has no sense of comic timing, and apparently neither does Tucci, as he wrote and directed this movie. It doesn't have the right pace for a comedy- it takes about half an hour to get them to the boat and have the plot start, and the things that happen before that aren't very interesting (save for a hilarious cameo by the great Woody Allen). Once they get to the boat and the story begins, the movie picks up considerably. The cast in this movie is fantastic- Steve Buscemi, Billy Connoly, Tony Shalhoub, Lili Taylor, Alfred Molina, Dana Ivey, Hope Davis, Allison Janey, Isabella Rosselini- even the usually stodgy Campbell Scott is great in this. They are all fun to watch, even if they're not doing anything terribly exciting.I want to like this movie, I do, but it's like watching an improvisational comedy class that goes nowhere. All the scenes that would be great in a Deleted scenes section on a DVD were never deleted. It's best when it's madcap and crazy like a Marx Brothers movie, but it's just not funny enough to be recommended.

That much I can say confidently and without a doubt, though sadly, it remains overlooked by some film patrons.

The two try some schemes involving acting but these go to pot. One day, the two make it aboard a ship in order to hide from a blow-hard actor and hilarity ensues as various characters, each with their own troubles or situations to deal with, interact and otherwise run into this comedic pair. All of these, however, seem to tie in with Arthur and Maurice's plight. The humor is reminiscent of Laurel and Hardy comedies, and has its slapstick edge which gives the film a great boost.

It is a comedy of manners and situations, which grabs you attention straight away and holds it right until the end when you sigh with relief that good comedy is still being made.

Two actors, Aurthur (Stanley Tucci) and his tall, chubby companion Maurice (Oliver Platt), are hard up for work, but they always seem to have an opportunity to use their acting talents, even if not working onstage. During a plan to weasle some food from an unsuspecting baker, the actors outwit themselves, fumbling their plan. Instead of the starving pair getting free food, they get tickets to a Shakespeare show. After watching the dreadful Bernardo (William Hill) butcher 'Hamlet', they insult the actor and get into a scuffle, forcing Maurice and Aurthur to hideout. Consequently, their choice of hiding places was not great, since they become stowaways on a ship. The same ship that the trashtalking-Bernado was travelling on. Things become a mess as Maurice and Aurthur scurry around the ship, pretending to be everything from bellhops to a British gentleman and his lady, in an effort to avoid Bernardo and several other extremely weirdo passengers, including Happy Franks (Steve Buscemi) as the horribly depressed singer who fumbles every suicide attempt; a couple disguised as French tourists (Alison Janney and Richard Jenkins); a furiously gay Scotsman (Billy Connoly); a Russian Communist disguised as an easy-going shipmate (Tony Shaloub); an annoyingly hypocritical German (Campbell Scott); and many others to make it a furiously hilarious odd assortment of characters. These secondary characters are really the ones who make the film so funny whereas Aurthur and Maurice are more like mild mannered guys who just found themselves in a bad situation, but seem to take it rather well. And again, as the introduction indicates, styled along the lines of silent-film comedy, that is the kind of comedy this film goes for--the slapstick/misconception comedy of Vaudville, matched with overdramatic movements and chases and whatnot of early silent film comedies and dramas. It is not blatant stupid-comedy Carl Reiner films (such as the Cheap Detective), because it doesn't drive the whole movie (there is more attention paid to the story), nor is it overdone. Best of all, the humor is delivered at great moments. For example, the Captain, looking for his long lost lover, seeks out a woman at the bar who veils her face as much as she can from him. He seems to anxious to know if this is the same woman he has searched for for so many years. He approaches her, Are you you? It certainly isn't the kind of thing you expect a guy to ask if he think he's just found the woman he's been searching for that long. It's really good stuff if this is the kind of comedy you enjoy.

From its opening scene homage to the silent-movie, this film characterizes itself as a vehicle which takes chances Tucci and Platt engage in staged battle at an unsuspecting street-side café, Platt opting to be killed by Tucci, even though - we are to learn in the successive scene - that it was, in fact, Tucci's turn to die. One twitch on the side of non-conviction and this delicately-humorous tableau would have fallen flat. Tucci pulls it off directorially *and* comedically.Ultimately, chance-taking is a double-edged sword, and teetering on that blade will either get you lauded as a genius or slice your bollacks off.Tucci's film is Damoclean in that the blade grimly alerts us to its presence many times, but is ultimately stayed by Tucci's deft comedic hand. For instance, editing seemed strained in a sequence which saw Tucci and Platt seeking a room on an ocean liner to conceal themselves - yet through this device, new characters were introduced to the mélange; then too, certain characters are colorfully realized whilst others float wraith-like through the script &#150; until Tucci's clever storytelling unites all these disparate strands at the Captain's Ball, when a character bellows Impostor! and we see how each of the varied players may be guilty of that accusation, all of whom flee at the indictment, which is, of course, not even remotely aimed at them.Alfred Molina, scenery-chewing like Tim Roth on crank, is that bellowing character, his dexterity at mutton-headed slapstick a revelation; Billy Connolly shines as the aggressively-gay tennis pro; Tony Shalhoub is overboard as the ambiguously-foreign, terrorist First Mate, but no one can upstage the singularly uproarious performance by Campbell Scott, opting to veer off the grid completely in his rendition of Nazi purser, Meistrich.Though Tucci's script stoops to Stooge-like pratfalls at times, he stays ahead of the Great Unwashed's pedestrian sensibilities by embellishing it with brilliant minutiae, sprinkled liberally - the bedraggled shot of Molina during an intermission of his Hamlet and his melodramatic apology to the theatre audience, replete with crooked wig and burp; Platt's mindless, drunken soliloquy, including dialog which seems to be way off-script (Boozy boozy boy! &#150; sucky farty boy! - I poke you I poke you I poke you!) &#150; and then there's Campbell Scott, who arguably steals the movie, whether entering the frame and making the soundtrack skip off-record, or propositioning the Social Director (a beautifully Brick House Lili Taylor), or impassively telling the ship's discomfited detective (played with witless Euro abandon by Matt McGrath), that learning how to kill people, is not that hard; Shalhoub's passionate radio call to his lover, including more seemingly off-script entreaties (Touch me pure! Touch me good! Touch me hard!); Connolly's man-wooing of Platt with seductive scenarios of wrestling naked on the steps of the Acropolis, that's where we'll wrestle, my semi-Grecian lad &#150; that's where I'll make a man of ye! And the *joie de vivre* of the last dance sequence is an utterly contagious masterpiece of the director's self-awareness, which could have easily gone awry. These are not unknowns peopling this film &#150; any one of these well-respected actors could have mutinied Stanley's decision to unify them in this last, ridiculously-genius dance number. Instead, they joyously partake of the bunny-hopping and arm-waving like a naive coterie of first-year acting students who have nothing to lose; in doing so, beautifully rounding off a superbly-entertaining film. This dance sequence, which takes them outside the set, through the crew, across the camera tracks and ultimately out of the studio building, is Stanley's knowing nudge to movie viewers on many levels and seals his brilliance as a director willing to take those offbeat chances. One of those rare Gee-I-wish-I'd-thought-of-that moments in film. Here too, we are indulged with the prominent soundtrack, which lent itself perfectly to complementing the film's action with its noticeably-distinct, recurring themes to signify melodrama, suspense, romance and slapstick.Is it just me, or has everyone already pegged that Tucci and Platt's first names echo those of a past generation's legendary comedy team? Stanley tips his glass at Oliver to utter the film's last lines To life, and its many deaths.

I was thoroughly entertained throughout the whole film and it became an instant favorite. However, this comment is not about the story of my life and passion, it's about this fantabulous film, so I'll shut up and discuss how great this movie is.I'd like to state that this is the definition of slapstick comedy. Stanley Tucci and Oliver Platt team up in this brilliantly funny film. They have so much chemistry on screen together. They need to collaborate more!First off, Stanley Tucci's writing and direction are genius. What a comedian in front of the camera, behind the camera, and in front of a computer writing a script like this one. Each character you start to love no matter who they are. The character development is also superb. After watching this incredibly intelligent and comic film, I now have a new respect for Tucci. I loved him in Big Trouble, but The Impostors is simply his best ever.Oliver Platt and Lili Taylor are also the shining jewels of this film. For the past couple of years it seems as if Oliver Platt has sort of disappeared from the silver screen and as much as I hate to admit this, I sort of forgot above my fondness of him. When I decided to take a trip down memory lane and rent Impostors my love for this talented comedian resurfaced. He's an amazing man. Such a clown. Such a hilarious cuddly bear. I've never been too familiar with Lili Taylor. I'd always find myself mixing her name up with another one of my favorite actors, Jennifer Tily. Now I feel that I can tell the difference. I've found a new respect for her. She's the cute, normal, down to earth girl who may not win the heart of the popular sex good, but the heart of an intellectual guy who cares about her and also will save the day. She's so amazing and clever, and I seem to be unable to articulate my new love. Ahh..the power of love.This comment could go on forever. I'd love to explain each character and why I've become to attached and fond of them. Not only are the characters brilliant but the actors who play them are more so. The Oscars should invent a nomination for the Casting Director because this films casting director (sorry I can't remember their name) cast every role correctly. In conclusion, I feel that this film will always remain an unearthed gem. It's so clever, comic, quircky, and entertaining. It is the king of slapstick comedy. Each time I watch this film (I now own the VHS and DVD) and I watch it twice. It will never get old for me. It's become a classic in my life and has a special place on my DVD/VHS shelf. I swear to everyone reading this comment that when I become a famous director, I'll remake this. Unfortunately, I'm afraid I'll never be able to top Tucci and everyone who worked on this project's genius.  "},{"Title":"Awful.

Maybe that is why I was so disappointed.  This a terrible movie.  There is absolutely no chemistry or viable comedic timing between the protagonists, Tucci and Platt. The rest of the cast is even worse, with one shining exmple, Campbell Scott as Meistrich.  Every joke and attempt at humor, save for a couple of sight gags, was forced to the point of embarrassment.The Imposters has a nice premise, but it looks to me, like Stanley Tucci, who I admire as an actor and director, has personally proven the old truism that comedy is the most difficult thing to do.

I was expecting a comedy, not a talent-less imitation of Stan & Laurel or french film. OK, 30 minutes, but still not smiling!This turned out to be the most awful film in the comedy genre, I have ever seen.Woody Allen appearing in this film should give me a clue, but apparently his appearance was uncredited. It may have scared me off on beforehand, or at least lowered to my expectations for entertainment. Probably some of his wives are in the film too.At least now I know, that Stanley Tucci has no comic talent whatsoever. If he is ever on a cast for a supposed comedy, I will know to avoid it. Well, more than 40 minutes wasted on this film. "}]
