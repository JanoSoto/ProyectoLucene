Want to see her before? Watch THE STRANGE LOVE OF MARTHA IVERS and other great performances. Young actors, this could happen to you if you do not save your money. I bet England called and wanted her title back. Do you blame them? How would you like to be enveloped in smoke bombs, surrounded by bald people in bathrobes with big triangles on them? Hey, seriously, I felt really bad for her. A great actress and this is what people under 40 will remember her for. If you like bald people milling about doing some kind of hokey pokey smoke bomb ceremony for twenty minutes; this is the movie for you. Before this, Kirk brought the parts to Vulcan for reassembly, his Katra or some mumbo jumbo, hey I was asleep at this point, who gives a crap? I love the rescue of Bones, the worst shot action scene in film history. The big guy begins his roll before Sulu throws him, now that is strength, must be his Katra. In the same scene, the big guy is shown blocking the wall ram with his arm, Nimoy was not exactly Michael Bay. If you ran the space station and Kirk, after you turned him down for using the Enterprise, says I will hire a ship, I'll get a ship! Would you raise the security around the Enterprise say a wee bit? Yes, you can just walk right in, he never would have anticipated that, great writing. See, they call it a space station because they have more than one ship there. They would not just send Excelsior, maybe like six other ships? The Genesis planet ages in wonderful consanguinity with the script, slow until the Enterprise is blown up then it goes like lightning. I love when humanists do ethics, see axioms have consequences; the needs of the one outweigh the needs of the many whose axiom was that, let me think, I know; Adolph Hitler. Yes, that was the rule he lived by, how'd that work out? It is the exact opposite of Spock's axiom in the WRATH OF KHAN. See, put down the comic books and think about what words mean when you say them. Why are we living on the Klingon ship? Why do I know all about Kruge's, cabbage head, little dogie? Why would I give a poop? The film has to be seen to be believed; you will see why Kirstie Alley declined to reprise her role as Saavik, do you blame her? Would you like to do some kinky, creepy scene with her fingers and Spock the disassembled, kiddie years? Talk about making your skin crawl scene, please we are eating out here. GROSS OUT. The film is surpassed only by STAR TREK 5 God Wants Out Of The Picture as the absolute nadir of the original cast movies. The acting is terrible; it is boring, stupid and as believable as your flying through the air. Some scenes evoked laughter when I saw this with 500 other people. The kinky finger mating scene had non stop giggling by the audience all through it. Kirstie, you made the right decision, you saved yourself eternal humiliation. Please, get a room; the movie is bad even for Star Trek and that is saying something.

They usually pan Star Trek III and label it a disappointing follow-up to the classic Wrath of Khan. But I just don't see anything wrong here. The Klingons are delightfully over-the-top villains, the effects and spaceship models are great (arguably the best in the series), and the theft of the Enterprise is a wonderful sequence loaded with humor and tension. DeForest Kelley gets some great material as the possessed McCoy, and Shatner's performance - slightly more understated than in the last film - is again rock solid.So what's the problem? I suppose this movie has difficulties standing on its own; it relies heavily on knowledge of Khan. But, such issues inevitably crop up when you're dealing with a long-running series of interconnected movies, and they don't matter much in terms of raw entertainment value. Some fans complain that nothing really happens in this film - it's just about getting Spock back and nothing else - but the death of David and the destruction of the Enterprise load it up with more than enough dramatic punch for me. And, can you possibly imagine Picard stealing the Enterprise to go on a rescue mission? I can't. This movie's storyline captures exactly what makes the original crew so warm, funny, and rebellious...and so it's a good Trek movie, despite what the fans will tell you.

Even the movie's key scene, the destruction of the Enterprise, is delivered in ho-hum fashion.It turns out Spock is still alive, mind-melded into the doctor's body while his own physical state is currently regenerating on the planet Genesis (why Spock would do this without knowing his body would be regenerated is pretty harsh, considering the schizoid mental problems McCoy begins to suffer from).  Thus, Kirk disobeys his superiors, hijacks the Enterprise, and goes on a quest to mend Spock's body and mind together.    Highlighting the movie's biggest flaw is the horribly unconvincing soundstage that represents Genesis.  Most of the visual effects are quite good, but any scene set on that planet's surface throws all reality out the window.  The film also moves at a painfully slow pace, never delivering much in the way of taut suspense, and the plot fails to conjure up any intriguing ideas or surprises.  This Trek was a necessary installment, and at least the follow-up, The Voyage was superior, but this is one movie that's hard to plod through, and I'm a Trek fan.

That would be 'Amok Time' which examined Vulcan rituals and customs, and interestingly, pitted Spock (Leonard Nimoy) against his captain and best friend, James T. Kirk (William Shatner) in a battle to the death. The return to Spock's home planet in this film was a cool way to bring the story back around to his Vulcan roots and add to the mythology of Star Trek by introducing such concepts as the Fal-tor-pan (the refusion of Vulcan legend), and the soul essence of Vulcans called the 'katra'.With the Genesis planet at the heart of a galactic controversy, and Admiral Kirk confronted by the possibility that he might have betrayed Spock, he has no alternative but to hijack the dry docked Enterprise and proceed on a mission that turns the original theme of 'Wrath of Khan' on it's head. In other words, the mission to bring Spock back to Mt. Seleya on planet Vulcan is one in which the needs of the one outweigh the needs of the many. The Star Trek core group is at the ready for this rescue mission, with Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelley) in particular an indispensable part of the group - he has inadvertently become the keeper of the katra so to speak. Spock transferred the essence of his soul into McCoy with a version of a mind meld before making the ultimate sacrifice in the prior movie.Now if you're a Christopher Lloyd fan but only know him form the 'Taxi' TV series or the 'Back to the Future' flicks, his role here elevates him to the status of one of Star Trek's top villains. I've read that portraying Klingon Commander Kruge was one of his favorite movie roles, and one can readily see why. He plays the part with a vile malevolence that's quite extraordinary. I'd like to say the same for his canine companion, but that was one sorry looking mutt, wasn't it?.The battle of wits between Kirk and Kruge brought to mind another favorite TV episode, 'The Corbomite Maneuver', a story in which Captain Kirk seemingly made up all that business about a destruct sequence to thwart an overpowering enemy. Apparently it was a good enough idea to incorporate into Star Trek lore as a legitimate way of dealing with an enemy who got the upper hand. Or in McCoy's words, a way of turning death into a fighting chance to live. A brilliant strategy on Kirk's part as it turned out, as the Enterprise was headed for the scrap heap anyway.I could probably go on with more positives for the story, but I think you get my drift. Rewatching the Star Trek movies in order once again is like reuniting with old friends, an exercise that never seems to grow old, even if the players do. In some ways, Star Trek is a lot like life, the stories come and go, ...and the adventure continues...

It just does not work, and for the most part neither did the movie for me. It is better than the first Star Trek movie, but it shares some of its problems. Also, it really is a bummer they could not get Kristie Alley back for this one as she is missed here too. You also do not get Lenard Nimoy for almost all the movie, granted if he was in it a lot the movie would have to have an entirely different title now wouldn't it? I am not the biggest Star Trek fan though so it is surprising how much I did enjoy the previous one. After that one, watching this one is a bit of a bore and a let down. Still, there are some good things, the finale is rather good, and it is nice to see a movie's sequel progress from one storyline to another with the previous movie not being ignored. It was also nice to see the Genesis planet up close. Still, give me a few more aerial battles.

The conclusion to STAR TREK II THE WRATH OF KHAN was a tear-jerking scorcher... But now we find out it needn't have been so overwrought...You see, in this sequel, STAR TREK III THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK, we see that just before his death, Spock (Leonard Nimoy), had mind-melded his essence, his Katra, into Dr. Bones McCoy (DeForest Kelley) with what could have been construed a sexual harassment touch and a single word Remember! Would it have been too much to ask that Spock MENTION THAT FACT to Kirk, who thought he was gone forever and therefore shot his corpse at the Genesis Planet, instead of keeping his body and rushing him to Vulcan General Hospital? Enticed back into the fold by being offered the director's chair, Leonard Nimoy helms a story by Harve Bennett, that picks up where TREK II left off...Back on Earth, Kirk (William Shatner) is confronted by Spock's father, Sarek (Mark Lenard), seeking Spock's Katra in the lifelong friend whom we believe Spock would have left it in. Tragically, it is not there. But Bones starts acting weirdly Spocky - and everyone realizes Spock's body must be retrieved from Genesis, to download it with Bones.Bones-as-Spock tries to hire a black market ship to Genesis, in a cantina sequence that reeks of cheap masks and flimsy plastic sets. Bones is arrested. Kirk, Chekov and Sulu pull a wild west rescue, steal the Enterprise with Scotty and Uhura, and head for Genesis.Meanwhile, on the science vessel orbiting Genesis, Vulcan Saavik (now Robin Curtis, warp-factor-two hotter than Kirstie Alley) and Kirk's son, David (Merritt Butrick, warp-factor-three feyer than Richard Simmons), discover some terraforming element of Genesis has affected Spock's man-corpse and rejuvenated it as a boy, who is aging in years by the minute. (I dare any Trekker to explain it scientifically.) Actually, the script makes no sense at all. But we'll continue anyway, just like the filmmakers.As Kirk's Enterprise wings its warp way to Genesis, so does a Bird of Prey - a Klingon warship of ferocious design, helmed by Captain Kruge (Christopher Lloyd, chewing plastic scenery like Juicy Fruit), the Klingons seeking the Genesis Device. Don't know how they plan to use it for ultimate domination - but it should be great for growing a nice terrarium on their Bird of Prey patio.Spock continues his growth at an alarming rate, so he goes through his seven-year jones for pointy-eared pussy every few minutes. Saavik does a sensually-charged finger dance with the teenaged Spock, which should outrage a few puritanical thumpers - if they had the wherewithal to apprehend sensuality rather than blatant humping as more conducive to causing social disharmony.The technical prowess of this production is once again light years ahead of its predecessors, and Nimoy proves himself a good director. Unfortunately, the story is simple in a bad way. And knowing Nimoy is pouting there behind the camera kinda gives the game away, dunnit? And Saavik finding young Spock early in the piece seals the deal that our pointy-eared playmate will soon come out and play with us again. So... what now?...Let's kill something.In this TREK, two more Grand Deaths - that of the Enterprise and Kirk's son one poignant, one very, very fey. Kirk dupes Kruge's Klingon Krew onto the Enterprise, then self-destructs it, as he and his man-crew beam down to Genesis's surface to watch the fireball which used to be their party bus flame into the atmosphere - a heart-wrenching moment for fan boys, almost as bad as the cancellation of the Scott Bakula line of action figures.David's death is a little funnier in a callous gesture, Kruge orders a henchman to kill either young Spock, Saavik or David, which prompts David to jump their would-be Klingon assassin, only to get knifed by the Klingon. (Must've gotten that weak fighter gene from his mother's side...) For tampering in god's domain (trying to create life with Genesis) David was punished with death - at least, that's what the filmmakers say, to tenuously connect the neck-sweater-wearing David with the brooding genius of Victor Frankenstein) - but I think they just didn't want someone around that fey to tamper with the masculinity of the Kirk legacy.The dramatic climax involves Kirk fisticuffing Kruge on the Genesis Planet - two middle-aged hammies throwing movie punches on a cardboard set.Then it's all aboard the Bird of Prey to Vulcan, where Bones is thrown on the op table and mind-melded back into Spock, Teen Spock very conveniently having grown to the age of Leonard Nimoy.Revived Spock, disoriented, asks of Kirk, Why did you do this? Kirk replies, Because the needs of the one outweigh the needs of the many. But I'm not buying it. You mean after all that turmoil in the last movie to illustrate sacrifice, you've just gone through the same amount of turmoil to prove the opposite? What if Chekov or Uhura had died on the Genesis Planet? Think Kirk would have wasted the fuel to go back? There would have been ten irate fan letters and the series would have green-lit production on STAR TREK IV with one less above-the-line paycheck to worry about.Because the needs of the many (the fans) outweigh the needs of the few (one minor bad actor).

This one was.*** Here be spoilers *** The Search For Spock was boring most of the time. Merrit Buttrick was boring. Where was his brilliant mother, Bibi Besch? Robin Curtis was boring. Why in all heavens did they let Kirstie Alley go? These boring persons were walking trough a planet which was instable. We knew that from the beginning, and were just waiting for the thing to explode. It took way to long. The film did not make us fear and mourn one second for the dying planet and the failing project which should have brought life to desert planets.Yes, and they had Spock with them. A kid at the beginning, rapidly aging but never showing any interesting feature. Not only because Spock's soul was elsewhere, but because the script had no ideas for him. He was played by four actors other than Nimoy himself, none of which did anything interesting.Boy, was that boring.The better parts of this movie were Kirk and his crew stealing the Enterprise, but Scotty sabotaging the Excelsior seems rather unbelievable. I wish they had escaped because they are the better sailors. Then they have a confrontation with some Klingons. I always like space battles. But this one was disappointing. It started promising. Kirk's and the Klingon ships both damaged, both captains thinking the other was in the better position, and both bluffing. But then intelligence left the Klingon when he sent all his men into Kirk's simple trap. No comparison to Khan. Overall, these Klingons were far worse than the ones of ST V. The Klingon Captain running around only screaming for the Genesis device became boring fast. Fortunately, he killed one of the other bores.Since the plot was not really interesting, something exciting had to happen. Let's blow up the Enterprise and swap ships, the writers thought. So Kirk blows up the Enterprise to get rid of a dozen Klingons whom he had lured on board. These dozen Klingons had come, by the way, to take over a ship of 400 crewmen. Wow. And then they went into a trap. And there was no way to fill the bridge with narcotic gas to knock them out? It had to be self-destruction? At the end, we have to force ourselves through the Vulcan ritual of transferring a soul from one body to the other. We knew it would succeed. Why was it taking so long then, and why did everybody say it wasn't done forever, and only in legends ? It was plain boring.Finally, Spock was back, and the film started to be interesting, trek-like - five minutes before it ended. Maybe we had to go through this to get Spock back. The price was not too high, thinking e.g. of his brilliant role in ST VI. But hey, hadn't the crew left Spock on Genesis, they could have spared themselves from becoming criminals, destroying the Enterprise, and boring the fans with this superfluous film where only the music is remarkable.

But on looking back in hindsight, this IS a huge movie for any 1st time director.On the plus side, the acting by Bill Shatner ranks right up there amoung his best in the series, with hardly a false note (especially when he receives the bad news). The other regulars all have their moments, some are a little over the top...but ALL of them are better in #4 (and perfect in #6, just like they were perfect in #2). The non-series supporting roles are a little spotty, Kristie Alley is sorely missed (a tough act for any actress to follow). And Spock's clumsy metamorphosis was a story snag that was deemed necessary because 'learning while directing' AND acting in a larger role would have been too much for any performer. Too many closeups that was so 'in your face' on the big theater screen (did we really need to be so close to Sarek's upper lip? good thing the guy flossed); but it was a lesson Nimoy obviously learned because those distracting TV style closeups are absent from 'The Voyage Home'.The music by the returning James Horner elevates the film to a grand type space opera that contain alot of epic set pieces (and explosions) and tries to camouflage some of the sillier moments. Too bad he didn't return for one or two more installments for continuity's sake because his music is phenomenal.After #4 came out, I re-saw #3 and appreciated the movie's finer moments (there are many). At the very least the story actually MOVES (unlike #1 'The Motionless Picture'). And #3 prep'ed director Nimoy to free himself from the studio shackles and make the next installment his more personal film; and accomplish what many thought would never happen to bring the Trekkers and general public together in an audience pleasing 'laugh out loud' adventure; #4 is a fond memory of one of the best times I ever had at the movies.6 out of 10Note And lucky Spock even gets to break his cherry!

Picking up immediately where the last film ended, it seems as if Star Trek III is an essential second act.  Many of the plot points and themes that were introduced in its predecessor become fleshed out further, and secondary characters develop into primary players.  Still, the crew of the Enterprise are at the center, and many of the film's best moments arise from the banter-like dialogue that displays their relationships to one another.Star Trek III tries to emulate the formula of Star Trek II by introducing a scenery-chewing villain.  This time around, this role is filled by Christopher Lloyd as the Klingon commander Kruge.  Lloyd seems to have fun with the role, and he does make a formidable foil to Shatner's Kirk, but he lacks the class and psychological depth of Montalban's Khan.  Still, the formula pays off, and Kruge's actions show that there are genuine consequences and dangers that our heroes must face.The visual effects in Star Trek III leave much to be desired, but do not detract from the characters or the story.  There is a relatively spectacular effect that is pulled of rather well, and provides one of the more satisfying moments of the film, both spelling a victory over the villains and a loss for the crew of the Enterprise.  The final action set piece is poorly done, but provides some entertaining moments, and does not lessen the quality of the story telling.In the final analysis, Star Trek III builds upon the successful elements of The Wrath of Khan in a way that creates continuity and unity in this fictional universe, while also providing more of the positive aspects of any Star Trek adventure.  It is true that without its characters, Star Trek would be mediocre science fiction.  But because the individuals that are created by this set of actors are so likeable and compelling, the franchise transcends mediocrity, and manages to engage on a human level.

I think what I like best about this film is that it's a movie about friendship and the sacrifices for the people we truly care about. The acting is first-rate all around. William Shatner, who I've always felt is underrated, gives one of his best performances as Kirk in this film. Ditto for the rest of the cast. Nichelle Nichols finally a chance to shine in the series as Uhura when she turns a phaser on Mr. Adventure. George Takei has one of the best classic Trek moments when he easily dispatches a Federation security guard. And DeForest Kelley has a chance to show his stuff.Although I'm sure a lot of people don't realize it, this is also one of the most influential Trek films of the series. It was in this film where we first got to see the Klingons as we know them today. We didn't see them in Wrath of Khan, and we really didn't get a good look at them in The Motion Picture. ST III establishes the Klingons as the race we know them to be today with their forehead ridges, uniform and all.An all around great film with a wonderful blend of action, drama, and a healthy sprinkle of humor. I highly recommend it.

The performances are top notch, the special effects look pretty good even now, and the score was magnificent.Several people have complained that this movie did not have enough adventure.  I admit there was not as much action as The Wrath of Khan or The Undiscovered COuntry, but this film shines because we get to see Kirk and the others interacting differently than usual.  Usually, they are doing they jobs, and are always addressing each other by rank.  But here, we see them as friends, even wearing normal clothes for once.The moral implications of this film are great, as Kirk defies Starfleet orders and returns to Genesis to rescue Spock, whose mind is inside McCoy. (I found this to be the only loophole in the plot. Nothing involving Spock in this movie really made any sense and was kind of distracting, but everything else was so well done it hardly mattered.)The performances were perhaps some of the finest ever in a Trek film. Shatner was actually good for once.  One of my favorite scenes in the movie was when Kirk's son, David, was killed, and Kirk hears the news.  He appears stunned, and falls back in his chair. (I think he fell out of it, but I don't really remember.) You actually believe that his son has just been killed, and he is feeling the grief.Christopher Lloyd, a very fine actor in his own, turned out a great performance as Klingon Kruge.  Although his character was very one-dimensional, he did great things with it.But one of the best things about the movie is its score.  James Horner, who supplied the music for Wrath of Khan is back.  Although it's basically the same thing as in Wrath of Khan, it works wonders for the film.  Just try to imagine the Spacedock scenes (in which the effects were top notch, I might add)without the great music.All in all, Star Trek III is a real cinema gem, probably one of the best movies of the 80's.  I would give it **** stars. Definitely worth a rental.But before I go, I want to say one thing I don't want to ruin the grand finale (Even though every one else reviewing this movie already has.), but I want to point out that it is very similar to the ending of the 1981 Peter MacNichol vehicle Dragonslayer. I think its because both movies had the same ILM special effects coordinator, Ken Ralston.  Just watch them both and you'll see what I mean.

Unlike the previous film, Star Trek III has a more mystical mood and is less action-oriented.  While this film is one of the weaker films in the Star Trek universe, it serves as a good connecting film between Star Treks II and IV.The movie starts with the triumphant return of Enterprise crew to Earth after their arduous battle with Khan, Kirk's greatest nemesis.  Despite their relief of their victory, they each have paid heavy prices.  Spock is dead, and McCoy has become inexplicably insane.  The Genesis planet has become an immense galactic controversy, and the Enterprise is facing an eminent decommissioning by Starfleet.The Enterprise crew is reckoning with their losses when Admiral Kirk receives an unexpected visit from Sarek, Spock's father.  Admiral Kirk is surprised at Sarek's revelation that Spock's Katra, his living essence, is still alive!  He then learns that Spock imparted his Katra, through a mind-meld, to Dr. McCoy just prior to his death.  Sarek then charges Kirk with the sobering task of bring Spock's body and Dr. McCoy to Vulcan to perform a Vulcan reunification ritual that could effectively resurrect Spock!After much contemplation, Kirk realizes that the only way to accomplish this task is to return to Genesis to reclaim Spock's body.  When he is unable to get approval through proper Starfleet channels to return to Genesis, he and his crew risk their careers by stealing the Enterprise, sabotaging its pursuing Starfleet vessel, and setting a course for the Genesis planet.In the meantime, David, Kirk's son, and Saavak have been aboard a research vessel at planet Genesis.  They are scanning the planets surface when they discover an animal life form on the planet's surface!  They beam down to find Spock's empty casket and a baby boy.  They then realize the obvious ... the Genesis planet, a planet created by a life-generating experiment, has somehow regenerated Spock's DNA as a young child!In addition, the Klignons have received information about the Gensis planet.  They perceive the Genesis experiment as a threat to the livelihood of their nation and set a course for Genesis.  When they arrive there, they manage to destroy David and Saavak's research vessel, take David and Saavak prisoners, and engage the Enterprise in an intense confrontation.Meanwhile, the Genesis experiment has shown its critical flaw ... the probe was designed with protomatter, a highly unstable substance.  The Genesis planet begins to age quickly.  The quick aging promotes quick aging in Spock and various meteorological and seismic disturbances.So, Kirk and his crew must figure out a way to defeat the Klignons and remove Spock from the planet before he and the planet suffer a tumultuous death.Like the other Star Trek films, this one raises several philosophical questions.  First, it asks the question, Do we have the right to create life, or is this power reserved only to the divine?  Also, it retorts the question posed at the end of Star Trek II with the counter-questions, Is the good of the many greater than the good of the one in ALL cases? and Are there things worth risking your life and livelihood for?Overall, this is a pretty good film that serves as a good connecter between Star Treks II and IV.  It has a satisfying ending that leaves you longing for Star Trek IV.

Spock's body has been interred on the Genesis Planet, a planet created of space debris by the explosion of the Genesis Device in the previous film.  Could Spock's mortal body have been regenerated by the life-giving powers of the device?  Could his spirit, safely stored in a now-unbalanced McCoy, be reunited with that regenerated body?  Starfleet, the Naval institution which pays Kirk's salary and plans to scrap the Enterprise, refuses to allow Kirk access to the Enterprise to find out.  Genesis has caused an intergalactic controversy, and has been militaristically quarantined.The only option remaining for Kirk is to hijack the Enterprise and put his career on the line for one last chance to save his old friend.William Shatner, yet again cast in the lead role, is not yet the characature he would become, and DeForest Kelly makes the most of his role as McCoy. The special effects are up to par, as usual, as is the by-play between the regulars.  Newcomers to the series, Christopher Lloyd, John Laroquette, and Robin Curtis, do little to deminish themselves, and also turn in solid performances.As director, Nimoy uses standard camara angles and largely uninspired technique, perhaps erring on the side of caution (as one might suspect his alter ego also would), but sets a nice tone of action, dramatic dialog, and humor.  To be able to coax actors into not sounding like ten year olds play acting in a garage while uttering the technobabble the script calls for, says something about the director's skill.Star Trek III, while not nearly as dynamic as the second film, is nonetheless a progressive piece for this series, and an open-ended continuation of a storyline that would cover the remainder of this team's films.*** (Very Good) "},{"Title":"The Needs of the One","Date":"1 March 2016","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" Star Trek has always been about the great adventures of the Starship Enterprise, but I think as this film quite clearly addresses, it's also about two unlikely friends, who are always there for each other even in the most dangerous of times. The Search for Spock does for Spock what Episode 7 did for Luke Skywalker. It's the search for Spock but it's also the search for Kirk's soul as the guilt of Spock's death weighs over him throughout the film. The whole film we are impatiently waiting for the inevitable, but luckily, the rest of the story is interesting enough to delay the revelations for just the right amount of time to give us the satisfaction we wanted.Leonard Nimoy directs and rightfully so, as it's largely his story, even without a ton of screen time. The story follows the Enterprise team journey to go back to Genesis, the planet created in the last film, to find and hopefully revive Spock. I think what I and most people will appreciate most about this entry in the long running franchise is the sense of togetherness that the previous two were missing. There is an emotional backbone to the team that perhaps even Wrath of Khan was missing.Of course, there are the inevitable villains who show and try to ruin the mission, this time led by Commander Kruge, played by Christopher Lloyd. All of the questionable campy elements to the villains are back and you never truly get a sense of where these people come from and why they are doing it. To be fair, it would be difficult for any villain to follow up Khan.The pacing is once again improved as it moves even faster than Wrath of Khan. James Horner is also back from the previous installment to keep us humming that glorious Star Trek theme even after the movie is done. Horner's music proves to be just as important to the emotionally layered moments as it was for the previous entry. With that said, I can't help but think this film is hindered by its tonal issues. We go from having a deeply emotional moment to a campy scene of Kruge doing weird things to slimy worm-like creatures.So in what is one of the darker entries to the Star Trek series, there's plenty to like. Kirk goes to some dark places that I'm not sure we really get to see in other films. We also get a satisfying conclusion to some of the cliffhangers the previous film left up for question.

Sulu has a funny scene knocking around a Starfleet guard who called him 'tiny.' Scotty and Uhura also have big moments. Sadly, Uhura is then sidelined instead of being allowed to go on the adventure with the boys. Returning as Kirk's son David is a permless Merritt Butrick. Robin Curtis replaces Kirstie Alley as Saavik and brings nothing to the role but a blank stare. From this point on the Trek movies were aimed exclusively at fans, with no real effort made to bring in a new audience.

COMMENT For a 1984 film I admit that the Genesis Planet sets aren't the greatest, but they get the job done. Besides, if you're used to watching the TV episodes they're fantastic. Star Trek was never about outstanding special effects anyway (with the exception of the unique and brilliant Star Trek The Motion Picture); no, Star Trek is about people, their joy of living and their grand spirit of adventure and exploration. GREAT LINE Witnessing the emblazed ship go down on the apocalyptic horizon of the Genesis Plane, Kirk asks My God, Bones, what have I done? McCoy responds What you HAD to do, Jim, what you ALWAYS do -- turn death into a fighting chance to live. QUESTION Just how far does the Saavik (Robin Curtis) go in helping the teenage Spock get through his first Vulcan pon farr on the Genesis Planet? The film itself doesn't concretely answer, it simply shows Saavik holding Spock's hand and comforting him. However, since early drafts of Star Trek IV featured Saavik remaining on Vulcan because she was pregnant with Spock's child, we can assume that Saavik went ALL THE WAY in helping young Spock (!). Okay, so now the question is Did she do this out of a sense of Vulcan duty or simply to get her jollies with a young Vulcan stud? Speaking of Robin Curtis, she plays Saavik much more Vulcan-like (i.e. better) than Kirstie Alley in The Wrath of Khan (I never bought Alley as a Vulcan). In truth, Curtis in nothing less than exceptional in this film. COMMENT Although early in the story Sarek describes Spock's 'katra' as his living spirit and later Kirk refers to it as his soul, it's clear in the the film that the katra does not refer to spirit or soul in the traditional sense, i.e. one's non-physical life-essence. We know this because, while McCoy possesses Spock's katra, the Vulan's actual consciousness or life-essence is simultaneously within his rapidly-aging regenerating body on the Genesis Planet. Hence, the katra could be accurately described as an incorporeal file of a Vulcan's knowledge and life, which is why Sarek described it as everything (Spock) knew, everything he was. FYI I never bought Merritt Butrick as Kirk's son, David, but he's serviceable. He died of AIDS in 1989 at the young age of 29. ANALYSIS The Search for Spock is a great Star Trek picture embellished by the welcome return of Trek's quirky brand of humor. The story expertly meshes comedic touches with dead-serious tragedy. It's also thoroughly enjoyable and compelling to see Kirk & crew in the wry and unexpected role of Starfleet rebels, risking everything to honor their fallen comrade. Another highlight is the return of Klingons as major villains, with upgraded make-up no less. The only problem with this Trek installment is revealed in the title -- there's no Spock, at least as we know him, but the film does a fabulous job of instilling a sense of the Vulcan's lingering presence. The story climaxes with the powerful image of Spock's mates warmly gathering together. This scene is worth the wait where a simple raised eyebrow fills the viewer with incredible warmth and joy (not to mention the shedding of a few tears). Also, I gotta hand it to the creators for coming up with an inspired and (seemingly) credible way of resurrecting Spock; the Genesis Project was, by happenstance, the perfect catalyst. FINAL WORD Star Trek III is inexplicably condemned by fundamentalist trekkers as a failure or, at best, mediocre. They're wrong.

Did it fill said shoes? Well... not quite. Star Trek III The Search for Spock is much different from the previous two films, and something feels a bit off. It takes place exactly where Wrath of Khan left off. Mr. Spock is dead and his coffin has landed on the Genesis planet created in a matter of seconds during the previous film. When Captain Kirk and the rest of the Enterprise crew return to Starfleet, Enterprise is ordered to be decommissioned. Kirk won't have it though, and he risks his entire career to steal the Enterprise and go search for Spock, who he still believes to be alive, just not in physical form yet. The Search for Spock also introduces the Klingon's into the films for the first time. It marked the first time Klingons had been spoken of since the original series. This film is undoubtedly a Trek film, but it lacks a certain something that prevents it from being very memorable.I say this film is undoubtedly a Star Trek film, but that is really only at face value. The Search for Spock has all the right characters and they're all a lot of fun. It also looks great for a 1980's sci-fi film. The interior of the Enterprise is as familiar and memorable as always, and there is also the introduction of the sinister looking Klingon battleship that really stands out. But there's a subtlety and a quiet brilliance that is missing from this film, and that it something that any good Star Trek film has to have. I think of it this way. For this film, the Star Trek slate was wiped clean. Some necessary elements were put back such as the characters and locations, but the filmmakers forgot to put the intellectual spirit that makes Star Trek what it is back where it belongs. It isn't like Star Trek The Motion Picture where everything bad about Star Trek was horribly exemplified and drove the film into the ground, leaving out the brilliance and depth of the original series' subtext. Instead, The Search for Spock just turns Star Trek into a shallow but fun sci-fi film.The story in The Search for Spock isn't poorly written, and overall there isn't a whole lot that is truly bad about this film. It's just when you boil it down this story doesn't mean much and it really only serves as a segway into the next film. The Search for Spock is notably more light hearted than most Trek films or TV episodes. This could have been caused from various factors. One such is Christopher Lloyd's awkward role as Klingon Commander Kruge. At first I really liked it simply because I love Christopher Lloyd. But after a while I realized just how non-threatening the Klingons were in this film. Lloyd has a lot of fun in his role, but it just doesn't feel quite right. There's also a severe lack of Spock in this film since everybody else is searching for him... obviously. Leonard Nimoy's cold yet intuitive portrayal of Mr. Spock always added a certain ingenuity to Star Trek, and without him for the majority of the film there is a strange empty void.I had fun with The Search for Spock simply because it is Star Trek, and I love Star Trek. But overall this film pales in comparison to it's predecessor, The Wrath of Khan, and it doesn't capture everything that Star Trek was about, only some of it. As a sci-fi film it is decent, but as a Trek film its issues are disappointing. There isn't a whole lot truly bad about this film, but there just isn't a lot about it that is good either. It has those moments that remind us why we love Star Trek, but those moments also remind us why we'd rather go watch the original series or The Wrath of Khan before this film.

If you are like me, you know beyond all doubt that Spock (Leonard Nimoy) would once again join the living. After he paid the ultimate sacrifice to save the Enterprise from the Genesis explosion, it was obvious that everybody's favorite Vulcan could not stay dead. After all, Star Treks IV, V and VI were yet to come, and Nimoy is the director.The crew of the USS Enterprise arrives at Earth to learn that their 20-year-old vessel is to be decommissioned. Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelley) inexplicably breaks into Spock's sealed quarters and speaks in his voice. Spock's father, Sarek (Mark Lenard) arrives and informs Admiral Kirk (William Shatner) that McCoy is carrying Spock's catra, everything that is not of the body, and both host and spirit are suffering. Only by bringing them to Mt Salaya on Vulcan can the torture be ended. Spock's body must be retrieved from the Genesis planet, but a peremptory edict has been issued that prohibits all travel there. Only by violating their orders and stealing the Enterprise can Spock's friends complete their mission.Genesis, if you remember, is a torpedo that can reorganize matter with the intent of transforming dead space bodies into habitable planets. The planet was created when Khan detonated the weapon in an attempt to kill Kirk. There is a science team on the planet led by Kirk's son, Dr. David Marcus (Merritt Butrick) and Lt. Saavik (Robin Curtis). Further complicating the situation is a rouge Klingon ship whose commander, Kruge (Christopher Lloyd) believes that Genesis was intended to be a weapon and flies to the planet to steal it.The inclusion of these three plots and all of the characters in them holds the movie together in its extended setup, which occupies more than half the runtime. The crew is also better utilized than it was in The Motion Picture or The Wrath of Khan. The Enterprise is only manned by five people, and Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) has probably her best scene in the series.Writer and producer Harve Bennett hired linguist Marc Okrand to create the Klingon language. Okrand painstakingly formed as alien a tongue as he could, even choosing the least common subject-verb-object relationship in the world. His rules were the groundwork for all future movies and television shows and the language has become so prevalent that google.com can now be viewed in Klingon. Look for the intriguing feature in the special edition DVD.The regulars' acting is all up to standard, but it is the performances of the supporting actors that are the most pleasant. Robert Hooks is both firm and sympathetic as the commander of Starfleet. Even though he is an obstacle to Kirk, we genuinely like him. Phillip R. Allen, good voice casting, does well as the regulation bound captain of the science vessel. James B. Sikking is even better as the haughty, scepter-bearing captain of Starfleet's newest flagship.The best performance, however, is reserved for Christopher Lloyd, who is at his quirky best. His voice is gravelly, as if a sheet of sandpaper is rubbing up and down on his vocal box with every syllable. It also possesses an unusual timbre and helps make the character more imposing. Lloyd was so demonstrative that in one scene where he says, bring me up, to his communicator, he spread his arms and yelled to the sky in several takes. Kruge is not as good a villain as Khan, no Trek villain is, but Lloyd helped set the trend of great ones in the series.The special effects are better than they were in Khan. Although the battle scenes are not nearly as extensive (the condition of the Enterprise prohibits it), our views of space are more elaborate and the vessels move more fluidly. There is one shot where the Klingon ship swoops past an exploding spacecraft with power and grace not seen since Return of the Jedi. The fistfights are like most of those in the original series slow and soft. The climactic one has the spice of taking place over volcanic holes in the ground, thankfully.In the end, however, it is Kruge that makes the movie work. Without him, the movie would be too weak and boring to hold its own. When he exits the movie, it suffers greatly. No guest role is more essential to the success of its product as Kruge is to The Search for Spock. Without Lloyd and his character, it would be bad and not come close to earning a recommendation.

Looking at The Next Generation (1987 - 1994), arguably the finest episode was the Third and Forth Season two part episode Best Of Both Worlds. With an extended plot time frame, the episode was marvellous. In a similar vein, the entire final season of Deep Space Nine (1993 - 1999) was superb because it contained ongoing plot lines and stories. Therefore it feels appropriate that two of the finest films created in the ongoing process, were Star Trek II The Wrath Of Khan (1982) and Star Trek III The Search For Spock (1984).Continuing almost straight after the conclusion of the previous film, this third outing for the crew of the Starship Enterprise begins with a crew in mourning. With the death of Spock at the end of The Wrath Of Khan, Kirk remarks that the ship now has an empty feel to it. Returning to space-dock, the crew are informed that the Enterprise is to be decommissioned and never sent back into space. Combining their mourning for the loss of their friend with the loss of their ship, things seem hopeless when Spock's father, Ambassador Sarek (Mark Lenard), appears and convinces Captain Kirk that Spock has in fact been reborn on the now off-limits Genesis Planet. Placing everything on the line for their friend, Kirk and his crew begin to plan a rescue mission.One of the most popular characters in the Star Trek universe, it no doubt affected a lot of fans when Leonard Nimoy's character was killed at the end of the second film. The eulogy given for Spock at the end of that feature was touching and was beautifully done. As a result, it must have been an awkward task reintroducing him in this follow up. It's always awkward to kill off a main character in an ongoing series, but all too often the death (or the subsequent rebirth) can be done badly and without any real emotion. It comes as a relief therefore that in Star Trek III The Search for Spock, the rebirth of this wonderful character is obviously written with a great deal of thought. Explaining Spock's return from the grave is slotted in well with the on running stories of the Genesis Project and with Kirk's love for his son David (Merritt Butrick). With all three stories mentioned to one degree or another in the superb previous adventure, The Search for Spock is not afraid to give us another wonderful chapter in this ongoing saga.Ultimately however, Star Trek III is not perfect. Whilst a lot of it's plot is well written and explained, parts of it feel rushed and irrelevant. The film feels like the writers (Harve Bennett and Leonard Nimoy) decided they wanted to bring Spock back using Genesis, have David's character die and blow up the Enterprise like so many have wanted to do in their lifetimes. Whilst the Spock story was organised properly and worked well, to kill David and to destroy the Enterprise, the script gives the impression that they jokingly created the Klingon involvement for this very reason. The Klingons, who had not made any sort of appearance since a brief guest slot in Star Trek The Motion Picture (1979), appear at the start and plod around with relatively little menace before finally dying and giving their ship to Kirk in return for the destroyed Enterprise. With an attempt to replicate Khan's menace, the casting crew gave the role of Commander Kruge to Christopher Lloyd, an actor most recognised at the time for a spell as a character in American sitcom Taxi (1978 - 1983). Whilst Lloyd would eventually go on to be more famous for a trilogy of movies about a mad professor and his time travelling DeLoren, as the Klingon leader he doesn't really do himself any favours. The Klingons have never really managed to inspire fear in any viewer of the films, but in the sixth film a few years later, Christopher Plummer at least gave us a Klingon enemy who we actually enjoyed viewing. Sadly in comparison this earlier attempt by Lloyd is more of a weak point in an otherwise decent movie.Finally, it's worth talking about one moment of this movie which has to go down as one of the most beautiful moments in the entire series' history. Whilst Spock's death in film number two is brilliantly acted and written, it is the destruction of the Enterprise in this film, which gives us the most poignant image. As the ship explodes and begins to crash towards the planet's surface, it's crew stands on a cliff on the planet watching it fall. Looking like a beautiful falling star on an orange sky, Kirk watches and states My God, Bones, what have I done?. What you did Kirk is you created an image which remains in the mind long after the credits have run.Star Trek III The Search for Spock is a brilliant film. It's arguably one of the best in the entire series. It's far from perfect, with one or two plot elements looking rushed and irrelevant, but it still possesses enough thought and love, for it to be a quality piece of entertainment. As the middle part of an ongoing trilogy, it deals with the rebirth of Spock and it allows us to say goodbye to another old friend, that being the original USS Enterprise NCC 1701. It also leads on brilliantly to 1986's forth instalment of the series, the sillier, more easygoing, time travel story Star Trek IV The Voyage Home.

The best description of Harve Bennett's script is serviceable, quite a letdown from the literary allusions and dramatic spark of II's scenario (by Nicholas Meyer and Jack Sowards).  In equal measure Nimoy's direction is competent, yet too stolid to rev up the plot or inspire standout performances from any of the regular cast.  The Genesis planet sets are sadly reminiscent of the original TV series in their lack of verisimilitude, probably due to similar budgetary constraints.  A stiff Robin Curtis makes a poor substitute for sexy Kirstie Alley in the role of Saavik.

Still, though, its numerous weaknesses are enough to keep it from being as good as its predecessor.First I'll go over the flawsIt had a good story, but I was extremely disappointed that Kirstie Alley wasn't back. This new replacement for her was nowhere near as good as Alley was, and she gave a very poor performance. I never really liked David in Star Trek II, but he didn't have much screen time in that movie (thankfully). Unfortunately, in this movie, we see him a lot more, which really bogs down this movie. Good thing the Klingons kill him later on.How did Spock revert back to being a young boy? It's never really explained in the movie (David said something about the Genesis wave affecting Spock, but I still don't buy it). And why couldn't he speak?The beginning of this movie is pretty slow and even boring. It's not until the crew of the Enterprise begins their mission to retrieve Spock that the fun really begins. But for over forty-five minutes, I was bored out of my mind, waiting for something to happen.Uhura and Nimoy are horribly underused in this movie, reduced to only small roles. The sets of the planet Genesis looked really fake, especially when its being destroyed at the end. The special effects are inferior to those in Wrath of Khan, but not nearly as bad as those in Trek V. And what's up with that ugly little dog the Klingons had on their ship? Stupid and unnecessary. The whole resurrection scene on Vulcan was a little dull (and even confusing).But enough of the flaws. Let's go over the many positives of this movieGood performances from Shatner, Nimoy (although he only has a cameo appearance), and especially Christopher Lloyd as Kruge. I never thought in a million years that he would make a good Klingon, and he proved me wrong. The Mr. Adventure scene with Uhura was hilarious, and I laughed when the Excelsior started to go after the Enterprise, only to stop in its tracks because Scotty sabotaged the engineering room. So much for that trans-warp drive!This movie didn't have as much action scenes as the others, but the destruction of the original Enterprise was a truly moving scene. It was very sad to see the ship go up in flames, and Kirk's silent mourning was very well done.McCoy's suffering from Spock's mind meld was inspired. Kirk's determination to save his friend was admirable, as was the crew's devotion to Kirk.So, overall, a pretty decent entry into the series. It is inferior to II and VI, but much better than The Motion Picture, V, and Insurrection. I still like watching this movie from time to time. A lot of people thought that Spock's return was a cheat that lessened the impact of what happened in Khan.

Oddly enough for a movie called The Search for Spock, one of the film's biggest problems is a distinct lack of Spock. Without him the chemistry of the TOS crew is hurt quite a bit.Also, the film does lack its own identity a bit, feeling most often like the direct sequel to The Wrath of Khan which it is. This isn't really a problem, it just means that the film holds almost no appeal to those who haven't seen The Wrath of Khan, and to those of us who have seen The Wrath of Khan (and many times), the choice between the two if we only have time to sit down and watch one of them is painfully obvious. It really is mostly a sort of bridge between The Wrath of Khan and The Voyage Home.The film's greatest flaw is the entire Klingon plot. I was never a big fan of the Klingons which I know I'm in a minority on but here they seemed especially annoying because they are thrown into the mix basically to add conflict and action to something which could have been just a straight character piece. Indeed, the only aspect of The Search for Spock aside from reliably good performances from the original cast which is more than merely competent (a description which applies to Nimoy's direction, most of the effects work considering when it was made and the budget, all the supporting cast, the overall story, and several other aspects of the film) is the screenwriter Harve Benett's excellent characterization and the several good character moments sprinkled throughout the film, my favorite being Bones telling a not-yet-fully-restored Spock that he misses him. The film could have been great if it had stuck to a simple character-based story. Instead the film aims to be, in its relatively short running time, a full-on space opera. The stuff on Genesis and with the Klingons is not really as good as it could've been and the Klingons should probably have been left out altogether but overall the film is a competent, and occasionally excellent, follow-up to The Wrath of Khan, but it lacks individual identity a bit.

STAR TREK III THE SEARCH OF SPOCK probably shouldn't have worked since if you've seen the second film then you know what happens to Spock. In order for this trick to work the producers and writers really needed to come up with something good and thankfully they did that. I won't ruin what this trick is in the search for Spock but I thought it was a rather smart move and it helped make the film a lot more believable. Leonard Nimoy steps into the director's chair here and it's obvious he's very comfortable there as he delivers a good looking film with a good pace and of course the main people back in action. Once again we've got Shatner turning in a good performance as Spock and there's no question that he helps keep the film moving.

Regulars like DeForrest Kelley, James Doohan and George Takei are also good in their roles. It seems a lot of people are split on Lloyd but I thought he was pretty good here. I liked seeing him under all the make-up and thought he did a good job even if the role itself wasn't the greatest. The special effects here are certainly a step up from the previous movie and I'd also say that battle sequences are much better directed. Overall this film doesn't quite reach the levels as the second but it's certainly a worthy sequel.

Not helped by Leonard Nimoy's flat direction either, it has an unfortunate TV movie feel about it, with cheap-looking rubbery puppets and rather paltry econo-explosions. Even Genesis somehow manages to be a little less impressive this time around despite the time we spend exploring it.While its predecessor had a rich vein of wry humour running throughout the entire script, this tends to rely more on (albeit successful) comedy moments and consequently a lot of the warmth is lost. It's still got heart, just not as much.It's not a bad film by any means. There's fun to be had most of the time, it's just a shame that so little of the sparkle remains.

Planet Genesis has become a political hot-potato and access is banned to all but one Federation scientific mission led by Dr Marcus. Back at star base, Bones starts playing up and Kirk learns that he is suffering from a mind-meld from Spock &#150; a process that must be concluded on Spock's home planet to continue Spock's life force and save Bones. Refused leave to return to Genesis, Kirk and a handful of his crew steal Enterprise and make trails back to recover Spock's body. Meanwhile Klingon Commander Kruge learns the secrets of Project Genesis and sets out to use it against the Federation.If you believe what you read on the internet then Spock's death at the end of the first Star Trek sequel was because Nimoy wanted to avoid a revamp of the TV show that was rumoured to be in the pipeline. So making the third film a way back from this plot development was perhaps an indication that this wouldn't be so much of a film as a two hour exercise in getting Spock back into the film series. This is reflected in the start of the film and the end &#150; both of which are a bit stiff, clunky and, well, lame. However in the middle (which is the majority) it is actually quite enjoyable and has many of the strengths of II in how it is fun and has a solid story with some action. It is not brilliant though and more could have made of the action &#150; in a way the whole Klingon plot does feel a bit like filler at times, even if it does produce the most engaging moments. As director Nimoy does well enough with the action and the air of the TV show but he is struggling with a script that was written to get his character back to life, as opposed to it being the best story in the film series at the time.The cast mostly deliver at the level we expect. Shatner does cheeky heroism well enough but doesn't convince with the emotional scenes involving Spock and David. Kelley enjoys a more varied role than normal and is OK with it. Doohan, Takei, Koenig and others all do what is required while Lloyd tries to repeat the villainy presence of Khan in the last film &#150; he is up to it but the material isn't there for him. Curtis and Butrick are both fairly weak and their sections with the aging Spock are pretty lacklustre.Overall then, an intermittently enjoyable film but one that does very much feel like it is a link in a film series rather than a film in its own right. Fans will like it but it is best taken as a link between the superior second and fourth Star Trek films.

Hip! Hip! Hooray! Why did the 2 worst actors in the movie, Kirk's son and Alley's replacement, get so much screen time? Perhaps they just seemed worse than they actually were because they were surrounded by upstanding actors like Chris Llyod.  Perhaps not. One of the problems with this movie is that I am not able to justify a technical error in a Star Trek movie for the first time.  I don't ever delve into minor plot flaws, but I am going to in order to prove my point. SPOILER After Kirk kills Klingon Commander Kruge and barks into the Klingon communicator,Beam me up,odd Klingon name, he is beamed aboard.  The Klingon sensors randomnly were not able to decipher the difference between a Klingon and a human anymore, but that's fine because I can justify that by saying, The writers just did not point out that sub-space interference suddenly engulfed the planet or The Klingon transporter officer got caught in the heat of the moment and turned into an idiot. But the fact that Lt. Saavik was replaced by another actress cannot and shall not ever be justified.  Okay, fine, I guess I could say that Lt. Saavik got plastic surgery for no apparent reason between missions and also had her voice box altered.  But outside of that, that plot flaw cannot be explained. It would have been easier and just better to cut Saavik from the movie and have her plot role replaced by Lt. Uhura.  Ofcourse, Uhura had so many lines in the movie, so I could see why the writers would not want to do that (sarcasm).  Like most--but not all--Star Trek movies, the other characters were just thrown in because they had to be, and that's a problem for a literary critic.  What plot significance did Checkov have? Oh, none as usual.  Like every Star Trek movie, good or bad, one or more lines always stand out that mark the movie.  Some have multiple ones like VI; some have just one, such as V that only had Kirk's, Excuse me, but what would God need with a starship? Even Insurrection had....alright fine Insurrection had zero memorable lines. The Search for Spock had just two. They were the following 1.) Spock's Jim, your name is Jim.  and 2.) Bones' You did what you had to do.  You gave death a fighting chance to live.Well, I say bring the old characters back for just one more movie!  Nothing can tarnish their legacy.  Look, Kirk survived mediocre lines and a disturbing exit in Generations.  In this new movie with the old cast, Bones--now deceased--can appear via computer generated images with the help of a person who can impeccably imitate his voice.

So when 'Spock', himself, Leonard Nimoy, expressed a desire to direct it, Bennett was more than pleased. Nimoy was not a complete novice, having directed for television (including an episode of William Shatner's 'T.J. Hooker'), his understanding of his fellow crewmates and Vulcan ritual was unimpeachable, and he had little 'ego', making the working experience with him a joy for everyone involved.As was the case with STTWOK, THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK was filmed primarily on sound stages, due to budget restraints, utilizing existing sets, when possible (which was why the Genesis Planet sequences appeared so claustrophobic). The film begins with a flashback from the previous film, concluding with Spock's coffin on the Genesis Planet. As the Enterprise returns to Earth to be decommissioned, strange things are happening to Dr. McCoy (the always reliable DeForest Kelley). He is hanging out in Spock's darkened quarters, and Spock's voice can be heard, coming from him. Admiral Kirk (William Shatner) chalks it up to depression, something the entire crew is experiencing, and sympathizes with him. Meanwhile, Kirk's son, David Marcus (Merritt Butrick), and Lt. Saavik (Robin Curtis, replacing Kirstie Alley, who had joined the cast of 'Cheers'), are on a science ship investigating the Genesis Planet (why David's mother, Carol Marcus, isn't involved, or even mentioned, is left unexplained), and they are detecting a lifeform reading that shouldn't be there. Faster than you can say Spock!, the pair beam down to investigate. Also investigating the planet is a Klingon Bird-of-Prey, helmed by the ruthless Commander Kruge (Christopher Lloyd), who hopes that any technology powerful enough to 'remake' a planet might provide a weapon against the Federation. Destroying the science ship, he and a party beam down to the surface to capture it's 'creator', Marcus.Back on Earth, Kirk is visited by Spock's father, Sarek (Mark Lenard), who is stunned to discover that Kirk had 'dumped' his son's body on the planet, and didn't possess the Vulcan's 'soul'. Unknown to Kirk, Vulcan ritual required a melding of both body and mind, with resurrection as the end result. Kirk quickly deduces that McCoy possesses the 'soul', (explaining his 'lapses' into Spock's personality) and finds him in a padded cell, after the good doctor, trying to hire a ship to go to the Genesis Planet, attempted to fight off Federation security using a Vulcan nerve pinch. Despite the warnings of the Federation, Kirk, after 'springing' McCoy, and the original crew hijack the Enterprise, and are soon on their way to recover Spock's body, and return it to Vulcan.Saavik and Marcus find a rejuvenated and rapidly maturing Spock, and the female Vulcan introduces him to sex, when the youth experiences Pon Farr for the first time (one wishes Alley had been playing Saavik during THIS scene!) Soon after, the Klingons capture the trio, and threaten torture to learn Genesis' secret. Learning that the Enterprise is en route, young Marcus sacrifices himself to save the others (Kirk's stunned reaction to the death of his son would color his opinion of Klingons, ever afterward). With the planet self-destructing, Kirk would have to defeat his son's killer, and rescue Spock and Saavik, returning them immediately to Vulcan, or risk losing his friend, forever. The climax, featuring the destruction of the Enterprise, and re-emergence of Leonard Nimoy, as Spock, make STTSFS a memorable experience.While the film lacked the electricity of STTWOK, it is a moving, powerful film in it's own right, with a haunting variation of the earlier film's music, by James Horner, and a cameo by legendary Dame Judith Anderson. Nimoy's direction was strong and cinematic, assuring him the directorial duties for the next Trek, THE VOYAGE HOME.No matter what 'tradition' says about 'odd' and 'even'-numbered 'Star Trek' films, STTSFS is not a 'loser', in any sense of the word. It provided Scotty, Uhura, Chekov, and Sulu (James Doohan, Nichelle Nichols, Walter Koenig, and George Takei) their best big-screen appearances, gave Kelley an opportunity to play 'dual' roles, and reaffirmed what STTWOK had demonstrated about William Shatner; that after his fiasco in STAR TREK THE MOTION PICTURE, the Canadian actor had truly reclaimed the role of Kirk.Definitely worth watching!

Kirk then finds out from Sarek (Mark Lenard, who had a brief, unrecognizable role in the opening of Star Trek The Motion Picture as an ill fated Klingon Commander and played a Romulan before playing Spock's dad) catches up with Kirk and tells him that there's a chance at resurrecting Spock, who's mind and spirit are housed in McCoy's brain while his body is on Genesis. Feeling obligated to return the favor for saving them all at the end of #2, Kirk and the gang hijack the Enterprise and rush towards the Genesis planet to rescue Spock in whatever form he may still be alive. Meanwhile, a bodily resurrected and rapidly re-aging Spock has been found by Saavik and David and they are stranded on Genesis after their ship is destroyed by Klingon Commander Kruge (Christopher Lloyd) and he comes looking for them in hopes of unlocking the secrets of the Genesis project, which he thinks could be used as a weapon against his people. Who will survive?Considered by some to be trash and by others to be the only good odd numbered Star Trek film, this is a sufficiently entertaining bit of science fiction yarn that continues following the theme of what happens when you mess with mother nature. Good performances as usual, with Lloyd giving one of his best as the Klingon Commander Kruge, who becomes oddly sympathetic in light of his blood thirsty actions when you consider that he was just looking out for his own brood and was willing to spare the crew of the USS Grissom. Shatner's brawl with Lloyd is also fun to watch, and the film still has that great James Horner music. Don't miss Shatner kicking Lloyd in the face shouting I... have HAD... enough of... YOU!Robin Curtis is a capable Saavik. As a bit of trivia, Saavik apparently engaged in sexual intercourse with Spock while he was going through his aging phases and, as part of an idea never utilized in the films or even in the spin off series, Saavik became pregnant with Spock's child, which was originally why she was supposed to stay on Vulcan in Star Trek 4 The Voyage Home.

An excellent example of this can be seen whenever Saavik is on the screen. Kirstie Alley may not be the greatest actor in the world, but Robin Curtis succeeds in making her look like Anna Paquin or Sigourney Weaver by comparison. The strange thing is that Merritt Butrick seems to suffer a decline in performance whenever he is in the same frame with her.Let's face it, any dialogue heavy film was going to be a letdown after the epic battles in Star Trek II. A very personal battle between two enemies that have been festering in one another's minds for years is always going to make a brief fight with a crew of Klingons seem pretty restrained by comparison. A lot of the film's plot elements also come second-hand from the previous film, so it isn't as if much is done to separate it.The spaceship sequences also look far less realistic in this film than is the case in the past two films. It seems that Paramount hired another effects house to simulate these moments, and the result is that the ships look as if they are under a constant invisible spotlight, rather than the realistic tones that were evident in the previous two films. The combat doesn't seem nearly as realistic, either. After the massive tradings of torpedoes and phaser energy in the previous film, expecting us to believe the Enterprise can be disabled by a single torpedo is a bit much.The dynamic between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy was always a big part of what made the original series work, so it's not surprising that an entire film be dedicated to restoring this dynamic. To the credit of the screenwriters, it works. The fights on the surface of Genesis, and some of the dialogues, give the whole film a connection with the audience that later films in the franchise particularly lack. Everyone certainly has a friend that they'd do things like this for if they had to, so it's hard not to get behind the Enterprise crew as they battle for one of their most prominent members.I would have appreciated more footage to show how Uhura arrives on Vulcan, and what the Federation does when they learn that the crew is on Vulcan. Still, the film is much more tightly paced than some give it credit for, so we can let that one slide. It is, however, interesting to note how little internal security the Starfleet orbital station has. I would have thought that the Starfleet version of the drunk tank would have more than just two security guards, given the wide variation in alien races that make up the organisation.In all, I gave Star Trek III a six out of ten. Most sequels try to be bigger and bolder than the previous episode. Star Trek III is an exception, but it certainly is a worthwhile viewing if you like a bit of science fiction.

Star Trek III The Search for Spock is, in my opinion, the best odd numbered movie in the series to date. If you recall at the end of Star Trek II, Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) gave his life to save his friends. His coffin was shipped off to the Genesis Planet, an experiment co-created by Kirk's son David. Star Trek III opens with some of this footage from the previous film. As the new scenes begin, the Enterprise crew is on their way home. But weird things start happening. Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelley) begins to act strange, and a lifeform has been discovered on the Genesis Planet. Is Spock really dead? Is Dr. McCoy going insane? Admiral Kirk (William Shatner) discovers that before his demise Mr. Spock implanted some of his mind into Dr. McCoy, which explains why he's been acting unusual. Spock's father Sarek tells Kirk that he must find Spock's body in whatever condition it's in if there's any chance for Spock and McCoy to have peace. And what follows is a very exciting adventure. In addition to finding Spock, the Enterprise crew must do battle with their most lethal enemy, the Klingons, who's leader (Christopher Lloyd) wants the secrets to the Genesis Project. As far as how good this film is, Star Trek III The Search for Spock is just a few notches below Star Trek II. The story could have used a little tightening and it's a little slow in the first half. But then the film picks up the pace with a thrilling second half. Will Spock be rescued? By now I think everybody knows the answer to this question. Leonard Nimoy made his directorial debut with Star Trek III The Search for Spock and did a very good job (he did an even better job on the next film Star Trek IV The Voyage Home). Star Trek III has all the other elements as well action, special effects, and performances, all above average. The cast does a good job as usual. Shatner, Kelley, and the rest of the Enterprise crew are back in good form. Lloyd is an exceptional villain here. Look for a pre-Night Court John Larroquette as a Klingon.

There's a little wrinkle in that theory though, and it's called 'The Search For Spock'.It's a sequel in the truest sense of the word, picking up basically right where 'Khan' left off. Leonard Nimoy steps behind the camera and does a nice job, delivering two knock-out sequences in the stealing of the Enterprise and the subsequent destruction of the Enterprise. The former is a really fun heist bit with some outstanding model work and the latter is another in a long line of great Kirk escapes, but this one comes at a terrible cost.Speaking of Kirk, I think Shatner's best performance as the character comes in 'Khan', but he's also quite good here, giving the Kirk a rare vulnerability; first in dealing with the grief over the loss of his best friend, and then the murder of his Son. The rest of the crew get a few moments, which I credit to Nimoy, who I'm sure was keen to give them more to do than spout bridge gibberish. Not faring so well is Christopher Lloyd as the Klingon villain. He certainly goes for it, and he has some really nice moments, but he often comes across like Reverend Jim doing Trek cosplay.The mechanics of bringing Spock back from the dead are a bunch of hogwash, but you just go with it because you want to see Spock back. Does it cheapen his death/sacrifice in 'Wrath Of Khan' ex post facto? Maybe a little, but it's one I'm willing to swallow to have him around for the next two flicks.While not in the same league as 'Wrath Of Khan', nor perhaps as clever and thoughtful as 'Undiscovered Country', 'Search For Spock' both advances the ball from part II and stands on its own, putting friendship and camaraderie front and center and delivering a reasonably fun and occasionally moving film.

From here on Captain Kirk sacrifices both his career, his son, and his ship in order to rescue his old friend.Christopher Lloyd pops up as a murderous Klingon intent on stealing the secret of Genesis, thinking it a weapon of immense power. To be honest the Klingons feel a little tacked on in this entry to provide some antagonists for our heroes; and Kruge is too much of a caricature cartoon Klingon to be effective. Nevertheless the movie does manage to be consistently interesting and Director Leonard Nimoy displays a fine visual sense - Trek III is gorgeous to look at.The Katra thing, while initially seeming hokey when I first saw the film in the cinema, has grown on me to some extent - after all the original series episode RETURN TO TOMORROW featured mind-exchange, so it fits well overall. But really, compared to its predecessor the plot is a fairly simple A+B=C affair. David's death feels like a bit of a throwaway, though William Shatner's reaction is justly celebrated.Perhaps the most annoying plot device is the use of Proto-matter to make Genesis worthless. Would Carol Marcus have not discovered this? I did not like it on first viewing and I don't care for it now. I have some sympathy with Robin Curtis who takes over from the popular Kirsty Ally when she demanded too much to continue her role as Saavik.

This third entry into the series directly follows on from the excellent second film The Wrath Of Khan and I'm afraid, it can't quite match that film's quality. But it's not a complete bust - a decent story and memorable baddie make up for dodgy effects and inexperienced direction from Leonard Nimoy. The beauty of Star Trek is that because we're so familiar with the characters that the film can dispense with time-consuming scene-setting and get straight into the story. The problems stem from the fact that few things Trek are as cool as light-sabres, Darth Vader or the Millennium Falcon.Returning to Starfleet to repair the damage incurred against the vengeful Khan, Kirk (William Shatner) and the crew of the Enterprise are still mourning the passing of Spock (Nimoy). But they don't exactly get a hero's welcome - the Enterprise itself is to be decommissioned while the newly formed Genesis planet is strictly off-limits to all. To make things worse, McCoy (DeForest Kelley) is acting strangely and Spock's father Sarek (Mark Lenard) admonishes Kirk for abandoning Spock's body on Genesis. He tells him that Spock's spirit is still alive and was transferred to another body where it waits to be reunited. Meanwhile, on Genesis itself, Kirk's son David Marcus (Merritt Butrick) and Lt. Saavik (Robin Curtis) discover a Vulcan child on the supposedly lifeless Genesis and try to rescue him from the murderous intentions of Klingon warlord Kruge (Christopher Lloyd).Star Trek III The Search For Spock is a curiously half-hearted effort, considering the fact a cast member was directing the project. The story feels much grander than Wrath Of Khan (the discovery of Spock's empty burial robe felt like the Apostles discovering Jesus' empty tomb!) but little seems to be at stake. We're told of terrible consequences if Kirk disobeys orders but we never see them. You never doubt that all will be well by the end which does mean the picture lacks a certain degree of interest. Another issue I have is with the performances by the cast. Lloyd easily outshines any of the regular cast as Kruge who has quite a few lines in Klingon but nobody else can hold a candle to him. Shatner and Kelley have one or two moments but the supporting cast mainly disappear into the scenery - I can barely recall any lines by Chekov (Walter Koenig) or Uhuru (Nichelle Nichols). There is also some half-hearted efforts with the effects. The model shots of the Enterprise, the Starfleet space station and the Klingon Bird Of Prey are very good but the surface of Genesis feels very much like a TV back-lot. They could have gone and filmed anywhere in the world for a planet supposedly terraforming before our eyes so why stay at home, other than to keep costs down? It's still enjoyable if you're of a certain mind-set but Star Trek III The Search For Spock is mildly disappointing after the great Wrath Of Khan. The story may flirt with bigger issues, the sort that Trek always did but in truth, this felt like an experiment to see if Nimoy could handle the task of directing a Trek movie. He passes the test but the movie needed better performances from the cast, better effects and a tighter script that offered more than a single-minded quest to bring one character back from the dead. I wanted a sense of danger but instead, I felt that it was a long winded ret-con of the events of the previous film. It's better than the first movie but a definite step back from the second (and the sixth, which was probably the best of the lot).

Star Trek II ends with the heroic sacrifice of Spock's life. This one aims to bring him back to life. The franchise needs Spock. So even if this is a bad movie, it's justifiable as long as Spock returns.The Genesis device has caused great consternation with the Klingons who see the device as a dangerous weapon. Klingon commander Kruge (Christopher Lloyd) is seeking the device at the newly created planet. Saavik and David are there to research the planet, but they find a Vulcan boy near Spock's final resting place.Meanwhile the Enterprise crew returns to base to find that they have lost their ship. Spock has transferred his mind into McCoy. Now the crew must steal the Enterprise and return to the Genesis planet so that Spock's mind could be reunited with his body. The whole story of Spock's resurrection is completely hokey and clunky. I guess it's hard to avoid. Bringing back a major character from the dead will do that sometimes. But the cost is small compare to the rewards. Even the final ceremony is hokey and unbearable.There are plenty of other problems. Not having Kirstie Alley return as Saavik is a minor disappointment. Robin Curtis is way too stiff. She's only half Vulcan after all. On the other hand, Christopher Lloyd is a great actor. The problem with his storyline is that he's so weak. His battles with Kirk are pathetic. The action is lukewarm. Stealing the Enterprise turns out to be the only fun part.

Where Wrath of Khan had all the original ideas, this film fills in where new idea's could have been with incredibly long winded fight scenes or large patches of dialogue. Don't get me wrong, it's by no means a bad film, but it is rather tedious to watch, although it does continue to contain many of the aspects that Wrath of Khan had including good special effects and enjoyable acting, although the Soundtrack and Storyline have suffered.The Story begins following the events of Star Trek II, Spock died to save his friends and was blasted onto the Genisis planet, the Enterprise returns home for repairs and Kirk takes a well deserved break, but this is interrupted by his father, who is angered by the fact that Kirk fired Spock's body onto Genisis when his father would have wanted Spock returned home in order to carry out a ritual to bring him back to life. Meanwhile, Dr McCoy has been acting strangely, and believes himself to be Spock after Spock transferred his mind into McCoy just before sacrificing himself in the reactor. Dr McCoy now wants to return to Genisis in order to return Spock's mind to his body, but he is not allowed to as Genisis has been cordoned off by the Starfleet until it has been fully examined by, Lt. Saavik, Dr Marcus and her son. As the pair go down to examine the planet, their ship is destroyed by a renegade Clingon Commander, played by Christopher Lloyd. Now stranded on Genisis, their party decides to look around where they find a young Vulcan child, who is in fact Spock, who has been reborn by the growing life of Genisis. Meanwhile, Kirk and crew break Dr McCoy out of the Brig (he was arrested for trying to get to Genisis illegally) and they hijack the Enterprise. After a pretty slow chase scene, the Enterprise blasts off into Warp Speed whilst pursuing ships break down rather pathetically after Scotty had a bit of One-to-One time with their internal working parts. Meanwhile on Genisis, Spock (who is now grown to the age of a teenager) and Saavik, attempt to carry out a Vulcan Bondage ritual as part of Spock's growth from child to man. However, the Clingons find the group and take them prisoner. In space, the Enterprise arrives only to be confronted by the Klingon vessel. After a short fight, the two ships are left disabled and without shields. Back on the planet, Kirk's son attempts to break free from his Clingon Captors but is brutally stabbed to death. With Clingon's now preparing to board their ship, Kirk and the crew beam down onto the planet's surface and a Self-Destruct sequence blows the Enterprise to pieces, killing the Clingons aboard and sending the burning hull crashing down to the planet. Not long after though, the planet begins to become unstable and starts to fall apart. With this now happening, Kirk makes a desperate plea to the Clingon Commander for him to beam down and face Kirk in single combat whilst the other's are beamed aboard his ship. The Commander agrees and the pair do battle above large flowing streams of molten lava. Kirk eventually gets the upper hand and sends the Commander into the burning hell below before being beamed back aboard the Clingon ship. After escaping the destruction of Genisis, the pair return to the Vulcan Homeworld where Spock's father attempts to carry out the ritual which will reunite Spock's body with his mind which is still inside McCoy. The ritual works and Spock is returned to his normal self, ready to rejoin his crew-members...Like I said, it's an OK film in terms of special effects, an understandable story and OK acting, but apart from that it's nothing special compared to the previous film. Christopher Lloyd plays a rather wooden bad guy whereas Richardo Montalban played the often flamboyant and psychotically menacing Khan. Like the film though, Lloyd's character is rarely remembered amongst most avid Star Trek fans. I'd recommend watching this film just so you can get a better understanding, but it's not one you'd want to see that often, only when you really start to forget the story.

On the whole, the trilogy was a good idea, following up a somewhat sub-par return to the screen for Star Trek with The Motion Picture that sold itself on the basis of nostalgia rather than story with a relatively entertaining series of three movies, which flowed seamlessly as the story continued on from one to the next. The Search For Spock is probably the weakest of the three - perhaps understandably since (sandwiched between the other two segments of the story) it neither sets the stage nor offers the climax. And yet, while it lacks the sustained excitement of The Wrath Of Khan and the enjoyably whimsical sense of The Voyage Home it works fairly well in its own right, and accomplishes what had to be accomplished for the Star Trek franchise to continue.The movie picks up where Star Trek II left off - with the death of Spock. His casket, though - having been ejected from the Enterprise - lands on the Genesis Planet, where life is constantly being reborn. Thus, the potential. Led, of course, by Kirk (William Shatner) and with McCoy (DeForest Kelley) holding Spock's memories in his mind as the result of a Vulcan mind meld Spock accomplished with him shortly before his death, the crew has to find a way to get back to Genesis to see if, indeed, Spock might be alive. To do that they have to overcome opposition from the Federation, which has declared Genesis off-limits and has de-commissioned the Enterprise as well as from the Klingons, who want to get the secret of Genesis for themselves.The movie suffers a bit from the lack of Spock, quite frankly. Star Trek (at least in its original incarnation) without Spock just seems a bit un-Star Trek-like. Mind you, Spock's presence in one way or another fills this movie - from his memories in McCoy, to the appearance of his father Sarek (played as in the TV series by Mark Lenard), to the title of the movie that clearly tells us what the point of the movie is, to the fact that Leonard Nimoy was the director. Still, Spock's absence was noticed.Still, though, this was an enjoyable movie. Even the secondary figures in the series (James Doohan, George Takei, Nichelle Nichols and Walter Koenig) seemed to play larger than usual roles - perhaps compensating for Nimoy's absence. It's definitely a worthy member of the Star Trek series of movies, and a very effective link between Star Trek II and Star Trek IV.

Aside from being doomed as one of the odd numbered Trek cursed features, 'III' still contained the humor as 'II' and introduced the common themes amongst most of the original crew's adventures a defiant/cowboy with-a-heart Kirk and incredibly stupid, alone & rogue Klingons bent on rebuilding their name/empire. Thankfully, though 'II' was far superior to 'III,' they made the correct decision in replacing Kristie Alley with Robin Curtis. Though neither great, Alley's interpretation of a Vulcan was like watching Pizza the Hutt imitate Jabba. And sadly, my favorite of the originals always will be Spock (with Kirk and Bones tying a close second) and despite the title of this film and the fact the characters (no real spoiler) spend very little time finding him, you really don't get to enjoy the character on screen as the genuine Spock. But, still Kirk and especially Bones greatly hold the screen until the finale. That was probably the weakest element of the film the over-long, snail-moving climax. Obviously, they made parts 2-4 to be a trilogy (thankfully advising us to forget 'I,' as we should, and basically pronounced 2-4 as what should have been the original trilogy) leaving clues at the end of 'II' and 'III' wide-wide open. Basic synopsis with Spock's body left on the newly born Genesis planet, Kirk is faced with a soon-to-be decommissioned Enterprise, Spock's father who wants the body back on Vulcan and orders to stay away. Even with stolen scenes from 'Star Wars,' I would recommend this entry, though cautiously. It needs just to serve as the gap/bridge between the far-better 'II' and the laugh-out loud comedy 'IV' is.

Life signs on a planet affected by the Genesis Device seem to be those of Spock and a crew is sent to recover him. But it's not the Spock they know, it's a baby. Meanwhile, the Klingons hear about the Genesis Device and want to get their hands on it. Khan wasn't able to do it, but the Klingons think they're better than Khan.While I think this film is not as good as Wrath of Khan, it's still an enjoyable romp that all Trek fans can appreciate. This is considered the funny one in the series. It was funny if you mean strange, but not laugh-out-loud funny. A Klingon, played by Christopher Lloyd, has a Klingon dog (which seemed a bit silly) and for a while McCoy thinks he is Spock and does a really queer Leonard Nimoy impression.The action was moderate, nothing special. The best part was Kirk and the Klingon fighting with fisticuffs. It's not the best fight I ever saw, but pretty decent by Star Trek standards.There was a plot hole. For some reason the Genesis Device causes life to be born on a planet and then speeds up and the planet dies. In the case of the baby, it knows exactly at which age to stop growing. A little odd, no?

What have I done?Yes. III suffers from some plot contrivances (protomatter! ponn farr!) but it's not the hokey New Age snoozer of The Motion Picture; neither is it the Shatnerian misfire of V, the ludicrous Generations, or the TV-quality Insurrection.But all these other movies lack the inspiration, ambition and gutsiness of III, a Cold War thriller which has Kirk putting everything on the line to rescue his friend. Unlike later movies, the consequences here are dire, real and heavy. This isn't the Enterprise casually crashing in Generations, or Picard's cavalier to hell with orders! in First Contact.No, when Kirk steals the Enterprise, we're seeing a man ready never to sit in the Captain's chair again...fighting the very real forces of Starfleet's creeping mediocrity, defiant with a spirit we'd never see again in Trek...and all with that Horner score -- smokin'.I dare you not to feel a pang of bittersweet hope at that moment when Kirk's gay son, about to be killed by the Klingons, hears a crackle of hope from the Klingon communicator Enterprise, this is Grissom calling, and Horner swells it up...

There is much humour to enjoy as well, but the prevailing tone of the film is sombre, the film dealing with the themes of grief and sacrifice throughout. The destruction of the Enterprise is profoundly moving, although one wonders at how quickly and easily Kirk makes the decision to self-destruct the ship. Technically the film is good.

The original cast was given a run of 6 feature films, all long after the show had gone off the air. For the most part, these films stand on their own merits, but began the odd-equals-bad rumor. By this standard, Star Trek III The Search for Spock, will likely be on few people's must-watch list.After a first attempt which was an extended episode with dire pacing problems, and a follow-up now considered the pinnacle of the series, Star Trek is back in a direct sequel to part II. As disclosed by the title, this is all about finding Spock, and making the core trio whole again. In passing Kirk has to face some serious personal issues and confront a psychotic antagonist in the person of Klingon warlord Kruge (an unrecognizable Christopher Lloyd having the time of his life).Star Trek III was inevitable, and for such an obligation it transcends its limited purpose by taking the characters out of their comfort zones. Kirk is psychologically stripped bare, first of rank, then of legitimacy and finally of his ship, made to take difficult decisions to save one of his dearest friends. Novice director Leonard Nimoy rises to the challenge, guiding his tight-knit cast to perfection in the character scenes and delivering some of the saga's most exciting set-pieces along the way, namely the theft of the Enterprise.Before the Trek films became solidly anchored in an odd/even cycle of varying quality, reinforced by the dreadful parts V and VII, part III managed the impossible feat of reviving the franchise and delivering a very solid film in the process, leading straight into the beloved part IV (again with Nimoy at the helm) and forming a very cool trilogy with The Wrath of Khan.Those who would give Trek films little thought would be wise to reconsider, and for any avowed fan who would overlook this entry, time to reconsider.A strangely underrated piece of entertainment.

And Everyone else enjoyed the Voyage Home, but for some reason the bridging chapter in the series is always unfairly maligned as first evidence of the 'even numbers good, odd numbers bad' myth that was genuinely disproved by Nemesis in 2002. The Search for Spock has an emotional core a great deal more robust than the one that forms the centre of the Genesis Planet. Spock's death is more than the structuring absence of the film, its tests the resolve and the loyalty of the characters and forces them to make serious choices about their lives. This is the stuff that good drama is made of and the script, by producer Harve Bennett, balances pathos with wit and imagination.McCoy, so frustrated by Spock in life finds himself unable to cope without 'the green blooded son of a bitch', and we are left to reflect on the irony that his former sparing partner has to carry his soul, becoming a space bound schizophrenic. However it isn't just Spock's soul thats at stake in this film, its Kirk's, and the reluctant Admiral finds that more sacrifice will be needed if he's to undo Khan's legacy. TSFS is where Kirk loses the things he holds the most dear including his beloved Enterprise and the son he'd only recently begun to have a relationship with. Nick pickers may wonder why Sarek expresses regret for those two losses in that order but everyone knows that the Enterprise is the major fatality in this one - an sci-fi icon burnt to buggery.The story is serious certainly, but balances the epic and minor plot to great effect. Christopher Lloyd's Kruge manages to transcend one note villainy in favour of something more menacing and dangerous, particularly in his contempt for life and his minor megalomania. He drives Kirk to new extremes including the terrific sequence in which Kirk turns the Enterprise into floating bomb for his would be Klingon captors. This is the movie in the series that shows you how far these characters will go for each other and how high a price they must pay for Spock's Return.Nimoy's direction is restrained and personal, James Horner's score bombastic and touching.

Ironic, because of course the film is largely _about_ Spock, but to set up this premise it was necessary to remove Spock, a vital element of the ST cast's chemistry, from the movie. Contrast this with Star Trek IV - easily the best of the The Original Cast movies - in which Spock's screen presence is so magnetic.In any case I didn't really wish to start on a sour note, because, on the whole. I think Star Trek III deserves more plaudits than it generally gets. Virtually the second half of a giant two-part episode along with ST II, The Search for Spock is less gung-ho and action oriented than its predecessor (this is why I suspect Wrath of Kahn rates so well it was a relatively unambitious action movie which fulfilled its modest ambitions well). Search for Spock is more cerebral and spiritual, with the emphasis more on an heroic quest than testosterone-driven action. Nevertheless for the most part there is a good balance between action and drama, and it is hard to put your finger on what it is absent from this movie, whch prevents it from rising to classic status. The storyline is very good, as is the acting. I suspect in the final analysis it may just be a little too sedate, perhaps lacking a traditional action-driven climax, and, as I mentioned, lacking Spock.There are some other problems with it, but these are standard for all the early ST movies (in fact virtually all SF of this vintage, period.) The special effects, inevitably, are dated, though only glaringly so when the ships are shown against other structures such as spaceports, or  when we get to see the 1984 vision of 23rd century computer graphics, which would have looked laughable a few years later to anyone with an Amiga 500 (note to myself if I ever make a SF film for God's sake, try not to show too much in the way of computers and computer graphics. No matter how state of the art it looks today, it's probably going to look lame in 10 years.

(MINIMAL SPOILER ALERT) We see in Into Darkness Scott in a pub/night-club, and we see here scott going in a such place, and we realize how details of the original series affected the new films. This thing could be noticed well also on Star Trek IV, less in Star Trek The Motion Picture.Back to the future fans like me will notice the presence of Christopher Lloyd in a somewhat both similar both opposed role to his role in the Sci-fi Comedy Trilogy.

The general excitement and humanity of that second film are replicated here in the third installment, and this time it is Spock himself, Nimoy, in front of the camera as the director.With numerous members of its crew dead in the wake of the Genesis detonation, the heavily damaged Enterprise returns to Earth to a hero's welcome&#x85;and the unfortunate realization, handed down by Starfleet Commander Harry Morrow (Robert Hooks) that it is to be dismantled and decommissioned. Complicating matters for Kirk are the revelation by Spock's father Sarek (Mark Lenard) that Spock may in fact still be alive on the Genesis planet, and the fact that Spock had given the Enterprise's Doctor McCoy (DeForest Kelley) a Vulcan mind meld to ensure that his soul wouldn't be lost. Torn between being an obedient veteran of Starfleet and the duty he feels to Spock, Kirk chooses the latter; but he faces, among other things, the megalomaniacal ambitions of a Klingon commander (Christopher Lloyd) who wants the Genesis device for his own people.With a fairly robust, humor-filled screenplay by producer Harve Bennett, special effects work by the Industrial Light & Magic team, and another fine James Horner score, STAR TREK III proved to be probably the best of the sequels to the 1979 original (which, unlike many IMDb viewers, I like an immense deal). Lloyd, who had been on the TV sitcom Taxi and who would go on to portray Dr. Emmitt Brown in the BACK TO THE FUTURE films, makes for a hugely menacing Klingon heavy, underneath all of that make-up; and Dame Judith Anderson, who had not been in many films for quite a while, is also quite good as the Vulcan high priestess at the end, presiding over what is essentially Spock's resurrection, as it were. Nimoy does a good job of directing his fellow Star Trek cast here, making a fairly impressive mid-1980s sci-fi adventure film, even apart from its Trek connections.

Although the movie stands on its own (if you're familiar with Star Trek of course) the viewer is recommended to watch them in that order. After thirty years the effects show their age, but it should be remembered that ILM (still one of the best in special effects) were behind this movie, so this was not a second level house making FX as in Star Trek V.Even though the movie is called The Search for Spock, this movie is more an exploration of Kirk search for sense in life and grief facing after the Enterprise crew struggles with Khan. As such the movie does not deal too much with new discovery adventures.Gone are under the sleeve tricks that always saved the day; something that the original series always presented successfully. This is something that furious fans decry, but the movie should be seen for what really is, an exploration of friendship and decision making under extreme circumstances.Nimoy pays good tribute to the series and respects the series canon. Star Trek III gives good time to other Starfleet crews showing the regular decision making of Starfleet. The pace slowly growths to present the final encounter between Kirk and his Klingon nemesis. Christopher Lloyd cast seemed odd, but his characterization of Kruge as a nationalistic and radical Klingon is fair. The familiar characters of the Enterprise crew return to this movie, and the actors characterization is more mature but they do not add new information to characters lives.Shatner is at his best here and he convincingly depicts the involved drama and his will to not surrender after all seems lost. Kirk has always been depicted as someone who is always cheating, but Kirk does not have many cards to play and the third act of the movie presents a losing situation where the cost to pay will be high no matter the chosen option. Therefore, the movie is sad and dramatic, and in spite of the hopeful ending this was new territory to traditional Trekkies.

They are ordered not to talk about the events involving Khan and the creation of the Genius plane. But Spock's father, Sarek (Mark Lenard) demands hi s son's body be returned to Vulcan and Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelley) has Spock's spirit in his head. On Genius, Lt. Saavik (Robin Curtis) and Kirk's son David Marcus (Merritt Butrick) investigate the planet for signs of life as a Klingon Commander (Christopher Lloyd) sees the Genius Device as a power shifting weapon.In comparison to Wrath of Khan, The Search for Spock is not as strong on a thematic level or with its sets/special effects but makes for it by simply being a fun adventure. The Search for Spock has a lighter tone to Khan, being a little more humour and Leonard Nimoy keeps a fast pace. Nimoy finely balances the three stories and linking them together.Despite the lighter tone, there are some moments of darkness and emotion, giving the film some heart and more emotional pull, especially for long time fans.In the realms of special effects Search for Spock does have some excellent model work, showing the scale of the ships and giving them a sense of physicality. But the internal settings do sadly look cheap and outdated, such as the guard station to McCoy's cell.The other major criticism is the actor, but acting has never been Star Trek's start suit. But we still get to see the strength of the characters relationship, their bond together and Shatner gets some emotional moments with his showing of pain. Whilst Lloyd did play a one note villain, he still injected character in the ruthless Klingon and he is a better actor then Richardo Montalban who was a hammy actor as Khan.The Search for Spock is a solid follow-up to Wrath of Khan, successfully continuing the story and not being too bound by overly complex technobabble.

In fact I even prefer The Search for Spock to the superior (so the majority says) Wrath of Khan. Following on from its predecessor, the film constantly references to events from it. While doing this it uses great footage and piles on Kirk's emotional baggage from Spock's 'death' scene. I put death in commas because as the film suggests and his actor's name in the cast list, Spock isn't actually dead. He mind-melted with Kelley's Dr. McCoy and left his body on Genesis. This film follows Kirk and his crew in their recovery of the body and their fight to stop the evil Klingons form inhabiting the planet. This revelation that Spock isn't dead, although fine as a plot element, sort of takes away the effect the final scene of Wrath of Khan has on you. The Search for Spock actually has a much clearer plot than the previous films and although it might be a tiny bit predictable at times, at least it is easier to follow than past Star Trek ventures.The way the film weaves between three groups of people (Kirk and his crew, The Klingons and Saavik and David) keeps the film very interesting and engaging throughout and almost makes it feel like an ensemble piece. The film has both improved special effects and space battles and the acting is very good throughout. William Shatner leads the front-line once again and also tops his performance from Star Trek II. And Christopher Lloyd's Klingon, despite not looking very convincing, plays it pretty scary. The scene in which Kirk and the crew steal The Enterprise is highly amusing and is great tongue-in-cheek humour. Leonard Nimoy, although consistently good as Spock, really finds his speciality in directing. His direction of all the actors really makes you care about their characters and he achieves something that, yet again, the previous two films couldn't do; he kept the audience interested. The film ends on a fitting high note and makes you feel very satisfied. And although Kirk seems to think so, I haven't had enough of this film and wish every Trek could be like this.

The problem is, with the way the last film ended, Spock couldn't be in the actual film. It was only natural that the next step in the series was to bring Spock back; hence, the search.The Search for Spock starts off a bit brooding, but quickly taps into the right adventurous spirit as the Enterprise crew becomes renegades and gives the Federation a hilarious slip. From then on, with bad run-ins with Klingons, the stakes are raised very high, and the struggle becomes quite epic. A few scenes stand out as being fairly epic and jaw-dropping. It is an entertaining thrill ride overall.My only beef with the film is that it still feels very small-scale. A lot of it might be because pitting the Enterprise crew against one small greedy band of Klingon rogues, led by a rather flat one-dimensional villain, just doesn't compare to everything we've already seen in The Wrath of Khan. Let's face it, Khan was too good of a villain, and nothing Captain Kruge does can outstage that. Not even the constant raising of the stakes, and confrontations with death, are able to elevate the film above and beyond the limited confines of its own plot.Despite those quibbles, the film still does the best it can to one-up most things, and still deliver the best story it can. The classic Trek crew remains a fun, endearing, and well-rounded group of characters, and their adventure follows a solid plot structure. Themes of rebirth, initially introduced in the last film, are reinforced here.This film boasts solid, steady photography and editing. Acting is not bad William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, and the other classic Trek cast members reprise their roles with good nuance, and with a little more tongue-in-cheek attitude. Christopher Lloyd plays the villain quite memorably, even if the character is a two-bit scumbag. This production has some really good-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. The music score has more of the same from the last film, and that's not bad.On its own, this film is fun and satisfying, but understanding its story may rely pretty heavily on seeing The Wrath of Khan first. As such, it's best recommended as an immediate follow-up.4/5 (Entertainment Very Good | Story Pretty Good | Film Very Good) "},{"Title":"I'm still searching for answers","Date":"24 March 2013","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" This movie didn't answer much. Search for Spock has some aspect of the Star Trek theme, but it is very poorly handled. Still, not bad for Leonard Nimoy's first directed film. This one isn't as bad as the other odd numbered installments, especially if you factor in the fact that it ties what happen in the events of the previous Star Trek movie 'Wrath of Khan' so well. If you are a first time viewer of this movie, I wouldn't watch this movie until you watch Wrath of Khan first. It's very important to watch that movie before this. Yes, Star Trek III The Search for Spock came after that movie, and being after such a masterpiece, people going to look at it being worst compare to that film. No, Star Trek film can live up to that film. Still the movie has some OK action scenes and interesting story. The movie starts out with recaps of the last few minutes of Wrath of Khan and then the movie officially begins. A spy has deliver some information about the Genesis program that Klingon commander Kruge (Christopher Lloyd) needs to hear. It seems like Genesis does, what Nintendo don't. What I meant by that is that Genesis has create life on a planet. The Klingons see this as a weapon to have. The Klingons were always Russian allegory in these films. So hearing this, must have been the same feeling when the Soviets heard about the Atom Bomb. Still, I cannot get over the fact that Christopher Lloyd is playing a Klingon, here. I was expecting him to shout Great Scott! or something. His character is quite stupid and silly at times. Just watch the killer plant scene, you can't help laughing at him. He's just not that menacing enough and not epic to the likes of Khan. Well, the Klingons are not the only ones hearing voices, but Dr. McCoy (De Forest Kelly) is talking all crazy about a certain Vulcan name Spock and that Captain Kirk (William Shatner) and the crew should go to Genesis to search for him. Now it's a quest between the crew of the Enterprise to rescue Spock before the Klingons get a hold of the planet. This movie suffers from the typical middle child syndrome of being a 2nd movie in a trilogy's story arc. Star Trek III The Search For Spock is the second chapter of what is called by some fans the Star Trek Trilogy, yes it is the third film of the series, but it's the second act in what is indeed a three parter. The first act is in Wrath of Khan, concerning its events leading up to somebody's death. The second act is in Search for Spock where somebody soul and body have to be re united and the third is in Voyage Home where somebody fully regains himself. My biggest problem with Start Trek 3 is that I feel it takes away from the impact of 2. The whole idea of life and death at the end of the 2nd one regarding a death of a character and the birth of a new planet is breath taking. Then this movie has Genesis's kind of break that apart! Breaking apart is a theme here. This film shows that Kirk ends up losing so much more than a friend. He sacrifices his ship, loses a family member and hope. The scene where Kirk is forced to relive his friend's death when he does the mind meld is a wonderful scene. The problem is when you look at how strong, 2 is with its story and themes and how this one causes those scenes to be all for nothing. It's disappointing. I think the worst idea is bringing back a character back after such a heroic death. The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. Captain Kirk's friend is noted to say for the reasons and justifying about his sacrifice. I believe that if you kill a character, then that character should stays dead. It does no favors for somebody to kill a character, only to bring them back in a later movie. Its movies like this, that started the 'resurrection of Jesus' concept of bringing dead characters back to live. A good example is Ellen Ripley who dies in Alien 3 only to be given an awful new spin in Alien Resurrection. It's like Nimoy woke up and realize how much money he can make, if he brings back a beloved character back to life. At less, this character got a good story on how he came back, so I can't complain too loudly. Still, it makes you wonders if Genesis was aging faster and faster; how come Kirk's friend didn't aged out as well. Wouldn't he die again by old age? Also how comes, nobody else aged on the planet if Genesis does that to life forms? Wouldn't they also grow older as long as they stay on the planet? The science is baffling. Also what's baffling is how Kristie Alley regenerated to Robin Curtis. It's seem like Alley didn't want to return, so the character was rewritten as a new character as Savvik. I find the Pon-Farr scene, stupid as hell. And where was David Marcus's mother, Carol? It would've been interesting to have her in Saavik's place down on Genesis and it would make more sense. The movie's over all is that it's works to a level, but compare to others. It's not that awesome. Still, it's worth the watch, so check it out. So start trekking.

I had heard a lot of criticism about this movie calling it a cheap business trick.'Star Trek III The Search for Spock' basically follows the story of Admiral Kirk who has a tough time getting over the loss of his Vulcan friend, Spock. When Bones begins to act strangely, acting as if he is Spock, Kirk begins to realize, with the help of Spock's father, that maybe Spock can be brought back to life if his body and his mind (in this case Bones) are re-united and a spell cast to re-join the two however Klingon Commander, Kruge, played by Christopher Llyod turns out to be the only obstacle as he is in pursuit for the secrets to Genesis.There were quite a few things I really liked about this movie. Much like Star Trek II, I really liked the villain here played brilliantly by Christopher Llyod, who honestly feels the scene stealer in this film. I do love much of the story and I do not believe that this feels like a cash grab, unlike movies such as the Star Wars prequels which were made entirely for merchandising rights and not for story. The story was handled well and it wasn't anything like Spock never died but much more deep. Also the adventure that this movie has is great and I loved all the movie until the last half hour where much of the film becomes rather silly and could easily have been cut down or it could've been directed much better than it was.**SPOILERS AHEAD*** Of course, I am referring to when Kirk attempts to lure Kruge back to the now destructing Genesis and the two fight. Obviously, this fight looks terrible. I am not after any choreographed fight sequence that goes on neither is the fight the big mistake here. It is how this fight ends and Kruge is killed in an extremely silly and childish manner, with Kirk remarking I have had enough of you! This is literally the end of the majority of the story until the film truly needs to wrap up.**END OF SPOILERS** Now the film does need a good 20 minutes to truly wrap up and it does get slow and the greatness of the most of the rest of the film truly drops for me here. I am sick of people bashing the multiple endings to 'The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King' stating that the endings were too many and too long. In that case, people do not realize that the Lord of the Rings is ranked 'Massive' on a scale. It needs those endings to wrap up a 12 hour trilogy...This film doesn't need 20 minutes to wrap up. This ending could've been 10 minutes and would've been perfect or the last 10 minutes or so could've been cut and as a cliffhanger, be added into the beginning of the next Star Trek film and I'm guessing it would work, considering the movie ends with 'The adventure continues...' The special effects were truly sloppy in this movie and such moments like when the Enterprise is destroyed and Genesis is being destroyed certainly do look bad.The acting is mostly good by the crew and was quite a pity to see a re-cast for Saavik...I truly loved the one from Star Trek II and yet, despite this new one being good, the Saavik from Wrath of Khan was superior.In the end, I can say that 'Star Trek III The Search for Spock' is a good movie and would be considerably better had that 20 minute ending to a 1 hr 45 minute movie not got in the way. That being said, this movie is still fun and has considerable entertainment and displays such adventurous quality to a fun Sci Fi movie and a rather good and worthy addition to Star Trek.

There are far too many slow moments and not enough action or adventure and all of the characters are too well mannered/friendly and lack good personalities or a decent enough background story. Not that I hate watching the movies but it aren't being ones that I'm likely to ever revisit. This movie however might be an exception of this. It's surprisingly good and perfectly watchable and I'm not ashamed to say that I liked this movie better than either one of its two predecessors; Star Trek The Wrath of Khan and Star Trek The Motion Picture The foremost reason why this movie never was liked and received that well is because it focuses on brining Spock back to life, while many thought that the movie by doing this sort of betrayed what the much liked and appreciated Star Trek The Wrath of Khan all did previously and this movie was just being a cheap way to continue the series, with Spock as a character and Leonard Nimoy as an actor involved again. But seriously I don't mind this at all. Spock always had been a far better and more fascinating character than Kirk for instance and the dynamic between him and the Kirk character always had been something the series relied and thrived on, so I'm glad they decided to bring him back.Besides, it also works out well, within the realms of this movie and its story. It actually has a pretty decent story in it, with more adventure and excitement than any of two previous Star Trek movies, in my opinion. Perhaps the movie feels more fun and adventurous because it isn't constantly just set aboard the Enterprise and it's a traveling movie, in which the characters are constantly movie forward, toward its goal. It also causes the movie to not really feature any distracting slower moments in it.It's not like everything works out well though. It still has some needless distractions in it, such as a bunch of plot lines and characters that easily could had been left out, or they should had developed them better, to make them more interesting. The whole Klingon thing for example. It would had been interesting for the movie to make Kruge (played by an unrecognizable Christopher Lloyd) and his gang the big evil villains of the movie but they hardly have an impact on the story and are just thrown in for the movie to have a couple of fight scenes. Things like this all prevent this movie from being a truly great movie but it still doesn't prevent it from being a pretty good and entertaining movie!An underrated and under-appreciated Star Trek movie, in my opinion.7/10 http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"On par with Wrath of Khan in my opinion.

After the Enterprise reaches the space station, the only establishing shot we get is of Kirk's house in San Fransisco. For years I've assumed that every other scene -- a bar, a restaurant, a jail, and a transporter room -- are all on Spacedock. (Or maybe next door to Kirk's condo). I guess someone decided that it would be easier and safer to make Trek movies as if they were making a TV show, and the result is a very small, claustrophobic film with no sense of scale.For all that, Leonard Nimoy's direction is not awful. It's competent, but never exciting. This is the one where Kirk and Co. steal the Enterprise to go on a dangerous mission to rescue Spock's body, but the hijacking and escape from Starfleet is simply not the fun caper it should have been. Trek movies are always so frustratingly modest.The trend of Klingon villains starts here, but Christopher Lloyd makes for a pretty dull baddie, missing a golden opportunity to ham it up. Incompetent Starfleet captains in stuffy uniforms show up to impede the proceedings a couple times. The Genesis planet -- like the rest of the film -- is shot entirely in-studio, rather than on location. Some new ships are introduced, which finally broadens the scope of the universe a teeny bit.The plot basically tries to make up for killing off Spock at the end of the previous film, The Wrath of Khan. (In fact, most of this movie's plot is basically an extended way of saying Never mind...) The Genesis device fulfills its MacGuffin role once more, and there are some impressive pyrotechnics near the end, but the climax is weighed down by some indulgent Vulcan mysticism. It's a touching story of timeless friendship, or something, with plenty of shooting and fisticuffs thrown in, but not really anything to write home about.

This doesn't mean it bad, rather it just means that the film isn't quite as rousing as the previous entry.Blame that on the fact that the film is also really the tying up of the Wrath of Khan's loose ends so the film doesn't stand up alone that well. It also means that the production feels a bit pauper-ish since the execs at the studio really didn't pump that much money into it.Worth a look, especially if you're a Trek fan, more so if you've seen Khan.

Just because it is danger and doesn't have humour throughout it doesn't make it a bad film.I thought it was brilliant in the plot that because Spock was nearest to McCoy in Wrath of Khan, he had given his essence to McCoy which is very funny considering the difference of opinions the two men had in the series and films, it is very ironic for McCoy as he is battling his own thoughts and experiences while having to deal with Spock's thoughts and experiences.There are some very good scenes in this, I like when they damage the faster ship to escape the spaceport, when Kirk gives the command to blow up the ship, the fight between Kirk and Kruge (Christopher Lloyd). The special effects were amazing as ever, the ones that really impressed me was when the ship was blown up and when the planet was breaking up around Kirk and Kruge while they were fighting.The only downsides is you don't see much of Uhura in this film and Leonard Nimoy as Spock doesn't appear till the end but I find it really interesting that they have Spock born again and having to go through the difficulties of growing up with his Vulcan and Human side fighting more ferociously and uncontrolled without his peace of mind that McCoy has in his head. It was a brilliant way of getting around the fact that Spock had died in the Wrath of Khan.On the whole, this is not a bad film and shouldn't be classed as one.

Finally we have a group of Klingons's menacing Kirk's son David and Lt Saavic as they survey the Genesis planet.This chapter in the Star Trek story offers good human drama, which while not as powerful or exciting as its immediate predecessor still provides some very memorable moments and considerable humor.The Klingon protagonist's may come off as a little bit cartoonish in their portrayals, although they certainly have some sinister moments. Definitely intriguing is Christopher Lloyd as the Klingon commander. Seeing limited screen time as one of the Klingon officers is John Larroquette.Leonard Nimoy is fairly impressive in his debut as a film director; one of his greatest limitations here appears to have been his budget. One of the more obvious weaknesses of the film is the fairly obvious sound-stage location for the extended scenes on the unstable Genesis planet. If the DVD commentary is to be believed this was a result of the budget limitations. The special effects here while fairly impressive for what they are do alter the level of believability for some.Robin Curtis takes over the role of Lieutenant Saavic originated by Kirstie Alley. While she does an acceptable job she isn't nearly as engaging or interesting as Alley, subsequently her career wasn't nearly as successful as Alley's.One minor aspect worth watching for is Chekov's atrocious costume when he re-boards the Enterprise, it soon disappears.

When the crew discover what has occurred they are determined to return Spock, both his body and his spirit to Vulcan, but after being caught in the Genesis wave, the planet has re-energised Spock's body.Add to this a renegade Klingon who sees the Genesis device as a powerful weapon and you have in the mix one of the most under-rated Star Trek films of the lot. The script barely allows one to settle in the seat as the Klingons arrive with a sense of destructive menace rarely seen in Star Trek villains, the script is first rate star trek story telling and the direction by Nimoy is absolutely excellent, the scene with Shatner falling over the chair after his son is killed is particularly poignant, and performed so well, you can barely believe that it is Shatner whose doing it, but I guess such direction and acting can only be achieved when it involves two people who have worked together so closely over the years, and this is Shatner's film, he is excellent in this one. The score by James Horner is magnificent and easily rivals the work done in Star Trek II and when the film concludes it does so with a genuine sense of How are they going to get out of this one? So why does it get so bad-mouthed. Well I can think of two reasons, the first being that it would be difficult for many people to accept this could be as good as the much-loved Star Trek II. Also I think that many people found it hard to accept Spock coming back as he had been killed off in the previous film. I have no such problems and see this as the middle part of the great Star Trek Kobyoshi Maru trilogy, that starts with II, sees III as the middle part and concludes with IV. The last thing that makes this special, for me, is the scene in the bar with the admiral who tells Kirk his career stands for rationality and not intellectual chaos. Since when? Kirk always picked the most unpredictable irrational plan, that's why Spock was there, to be the rational one. Clearly this guy has got the wrong file and Kirk looking into space reflects that.

This is about the characters, they are the main drive, and one or two get their moments this time around. The addition of Lloyd was a marvelous idea, and he performs his role well. The acting is effective. The direction is interesting, and this was the beginning of the trend of letting the players have a sit in that chair. This has several nice references to the show that don't require you to have watched it. There is wit in this, and it's great. It doesn't take over either, and on the subject of such, the effects must be mentioned... they're magnificent, convincing and, frankly, cool. The action is last-mentioned, too(almost invariably), and well-done, including the fights and the climactic battle. This is fun, entertaining, without being less than what Star Trek is... think of it as one of the less intellectual(and, thankfully, less so than the first movie) episodes of TOS. I guess that's why it's been panned, that, and the one immediately preceding it(lest it be forgotten, that effort was the earliest that didn't appeal to the lowest common denominator).

Later, I also saw several of the movies while growing up, and The Search for Spock was one of them. After many years, I have watched it again, not long after watching the first two ST movies, both of which I had never seen before this year. Like many others, I was not pleased with The Motion Picture, but was with The Wrath of Khan. For me, I think The Search for Spock came somewhere in between, but closer to TWOK, fortunately.After the Enterprise is mostly repaired from the damages caused by the last battle, the crew returns to Earth. Once there, they learn that the ship is to be retired. When Dr. McCoy starts acting mysteriously, Spock's father, Sarek, informs Kirk that Spock's soul is inside McCoy, and in order to save both of his friends, he must go to Genesis! Kirk then asks Admiral Morrow if he can return to this planet, but permission is denied. Still determined to save Spock and McCoy, he and his crew risk their careers by stealing the Enterprise and heading for Genesis! Unfortunately, the Klingons discover the secrets of Project Genesis, and Kirk and his crew have another battle to face on their way to the planet! This third installment in the Star Trek movie franchise may have a rather lacklustre beginning, but it soon improves. It's not always consistent, and the script is not absolutely perfect, sometimes faltering, but the movie is rarely dull, with a good amount of excitement, along with a bit of humour, including the part where McCoy tries to do the Vulcan neck pinch, and some impressive effects as well. Towards the end of the movie, it may lag a bit, and the story may seem just a tad too long (even though the movie is shorter than its two predecessors), but I certainly can't say I was displeased by the end.The ratings for The Wrath of Khan and The Search for Spock suggest that the former is far superior to the latter. It has been several months since I last saw the 1982 film, but in my opinion, I think it's probably slightly superior to this 1984 follow-up. I gave TWOK an 8/10, and as you can see, I have given TSFS a 7/10. I'm not sure whether I could give this film an 8/10 or not.

This is also akin to lending itself to a lot of comedy too, both unintentional and on the fly with levels of known goofiness, and it was in Star Treks 2, 3 and 4 that the franchise hit its richest stride to date. This third film, according to some fans, is actually one of the weaker of the series. I'd disagree, though it's not simply for the reason that Spock's cool (though, in his Mr. Know-it-all way and super Vulcan ways subdued completely by Nimoy, he is). The Search for Spock contains some very keen special effects, per usual, not least of which the dying planet Genesis, which before it does goes through some climate changes, like jungle, arctic region, and finally total decay, or the ships themselves and the green Klingon ship. Shatner, for his occasional hamming-up with the frozen looks via dramatic pauses, does reach into some good acting here, primarily due to Kirk having to be forced with real dire conflicts in this episode that make him lose many important things to him (or rather, a thing and a person, as he tries to get back his friend). Christopher Lloyd is a wonderfully two-dimensional Klingon (or maybe one and a half dimensional, if there's something like that) who surprises in being a sturdy villain through his make-up and equal hamboning. Moments of light absurdity flare up, like McCoy's unnerving sense in trying to grasp the mind-meld Spock laid on him in the previous entry, or just the way Kirk says Klingon bastards.But Nimoy as director, through an excellently tuned genre-specific screenplay by producer Bennet (specific to surprises via formula), aside from maybe a little slip-up in mood during the climactic rush to save Spock, is very crafty at making things seem totally simple plot-wise but with just the right levels of visual wonderment like on Genesis with the more weighty acting scenes like with Spock's father. He's made a diversion that doesn't over-stay its welcome, has some cool battle sequences and fight scenes (I have had enough of you!), and leaves on a well-done note of bittersweet reasoning that leaves some great tragedy, but a lot of happiness as well.

Her replacement, actress Curtis, utters her lines in that unemotional tone indicating she follows the Vulcan way, but the delivery comes across as very flat and robotic, with no undertone to suggest suppressed passions. In her first scene, she calls David (Kirk's son) so human, but it's a meaningless statement; is she insulting him? Humoring him? Praising him? It feels like none of those, like nothing. She is the weakest character in the story, which continues directly from the end of The Wrath of Khan. Since this functions as the middle film of the trilogy composed of Trek films two through four, it has the usual weaknesses of such no real beginning and an ending with many unresolved issues (which will be answered in the 4th film). There are some plot twists intended to be as shocking and out-of-left-field revelations, but they're here for shock effect, some might argue as unnecessary and lack the majesty of the previous film - in a way, rather crude exposition and violence, by comparison.Kirk and his small crew head back to Earth in a scarred, damaged Enterprise and everyone aboard is understandably depressed. McCoy does them one better he behaves as if possessed...by what? A Vulcan spirit? Upon their arrival home, the ship is promptly decommissioned (the admiral here states that the Enterprise is 20 years old; he must mean 20 years since the 1st big refit, when Kirk first began commanding her; she's 40 years old if you count the missions of Captains Pike and April). Everything appears to grind to a halt; there's a nice piece of the surviving crew socializing in Kirk's apartment when who should show up but Spock's father, Sarek (actor Lenard reprising his role from the original series). Kirk now has his new mission and it's a doozy - it's basically the MissionImpossible-style entry of the Trek films; you know Kirk will succeed eventually, but getting there is most of the fun. A lot of the plot involves the bureaucracy of Starfleet and the current climate of 23rd century Earth - we don't see too much - an amusing scene with McCoy in a weird bar, for example. There's also the amusing sequence with the new starship, the Excelsior, and its smug captain. All these, however, stray from the premise of the original series, where it was understood humanity had evolved over the past couple of centuries; all the characters here behave in much the same way as we would expect 20th-century people to behave.This film also returns the brutish Klingons to the forefront as Trek's most nasty adversaries. I think they went a bit overboard in depicting the Klingon bridge as the polar opposite to the typical Starfleet bridge. Kruge's pet, a dog turned inside-out it seems, and Kruge's penchant for vaporizing officers who say the wrong thing plunges this into dark satire. The Klingons get as far as they do in this story based on dumb luck and it's only when they deal a fatal blow to Kirk's family that they're elevated to 'villains we love to hate' - and turns this into a fitting precursor to the 6th Trek film, where Kirk's antipathy towards Klingons gets the most play. There's also a yin-and-yang theme at play Kirk will succeed in his quest to find Spock and aid the suffering McCoy (excellent performance from Kelley, as usual), but only if he loses a couple of other things precious to him. The Genesis Planet, which sometimes has a 'studio set' feel, is remarkable, but David used unethical shortcuts to get the job done and so must pay a price for his transgressions. It's a tough, morally unyielding Trek universe we seem to have here when, despite epic struggles, one barely breaks even. Nimoy's directing debut wasn't too bad and he expanded the roles for the other regulars to good effect, but he fared much better with the next one, The Voyage Home.

The drama inherent in what Kirk must to sacrifice to save Spock is touching and sad. By the end of the film, he has lost everything but McCoy and Spock, and it's only in the last minutes that any ray of hope shines into a story that is almost entirely somber and downbeat. Not to say that there aren't some jokes and humor in the film, more that the overall tone is very serious. The entire movie is about choice, sacrifice and outcomes Kirk and his crew throw away their futures and risk their lives for one of their own, Kirk's son David has to confront the results of his impatience and pays the ultimate price for it. In it's written form it is a beautiful story.The execution isn't the best, however. The camera work is occasionally awkward, and unusually static at times. The lighting is often garish, with entire scenes painted in either primary color washes or a bland pastel color that makes everything look like a Better Homes and Gardens photo spread. Many of the set decorations follow this pastel look, the most obvious example being the truly awful pink upholstery on the Grissom bridge. The art design and lighting also conspire to make much of the scenery look cheap. It even sneaks into the special effects, at least on the DVD version. The previous Trek films had dynamically lit models that looked big and moved with a good sense of mass. Here, everything is washed out, with the Enterprise looking like it has it's own personal gaffer following it with a flood lamp. There's little modeling and detail, and many ship shots come off looking flat and almost 2D. Even explosions look pale and dull. The funny thing is that these flat and dull space shots are in the same film as some wonderful matte paintings and miniature landscape work. Following the white, antiseptic look of the ships, the rich colors and glitzy effects of the Genesis planet destruction are a revelation. Much later edit the Blu-Ray is better in this regard. The contrast of the special effects shots has been tweaked and as a result they look much more dynamic and realistic for the most part. Some of the brighter effects and colors (like explosions) are a bit over saturated now, but it's not too distracting.The acting is a mixture of good and 'meh'. Compared to his morose and pouting turn in Trek II, Merritt Butrick is much improved here. He brings a good sense of regret to David, and his acting subtly changes over the course of the movie as he slowly realizes the magnitude of the mistake that's brought him to where he is. The rest of the cast falls into the usual lines, with none of them get much airplay outside of brief moments (Sulu and Uhura's are pretty memorable though). It's clear early on that this film is all about Kirk and McCoy, and thankfully Shatner continues the toned down Kirk he introduced in Trek II. The look of emotional pain on his face as he is forced to recall Spock's death is touching, and when he is confronted with the death of David his backwards stumble actually works (even if his dialog delivery is a bit too theatrical). Deforest Kelley expertly balances the stoicism of Spock with McCoy's usual antics, leading to the most accomplished acting in the movie. Plus, he gets the best one-liner in the movie.The weak link is the Klingons. Outside of the intelligence exhibited by Maltz (John Laroquette), they are portrayed as fanatical morons that are so single minded in their pursuit and so oblivious to reality that they are impossible to take seriously. Case in point it's understood in the Star Trek universe that the Enterprise has, at least, a few hundred people on board. The Klingon ship, according to Sulu, has about 12. Kruge, the Klingon commander believing the Enterprise is fully manned, sends a boarding party of eight whole people to take over the ship. When an officer tries to inform Kruge of these *slightly* unequal numbers, Kruge barks we are Klingons!, and carries on. With such sound judgment it's hard to believe he was ever given a command. Christopher Lloyd really tries to make Kruge threatening, but he just can't close the deal when the character itself is so ridiculous and poor.So, at the end of the day, you have a well written movie (except for the villains) that is occasionally undermined by some of Leonard Nimoy's freshman directing choices, poor lighting, cheap sets and occasionally sloppy visual effects. All of these issues (especially Nimoy's visual style) would improve dramatically two years later with Star Trek IV, but here they are a noticeable anchor that keeps the movie from soaring outside of some fleeting moments. Thankfully the script was strong enough to shine through, making Star Trek III a flawed, but ultimately successful movie.

The story is actually very ingenious and actually makes a lot of sense, I mean to say that it is a very well told story and really does a great job of keeping you interested.

I was so happy to see Christopher Lloyd in this film, it was really odd to see him as a Klingon, but I thought he did a fantastic job.  Everyone else in the film was great too.An interesting note about this film is that it is directed by none other than Leonard Nimoy himself, a.k.a. Spock.  Pretty cool, yeah?Compared to the preceding Star Trek films, I thought this film was just as good as Star Trek The Motion Picture and Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan.  It seems that most people like Part 2 more than Part 1 and 3, but I liked them all pretty much the same.  Also, I think it's kind of hard to not like The Search for Spock because The Wrath of Khan and The Search for Spock flow together so nicely that they're almost one movie.

Therefore. Star Trek III The Search For Spock, is somehow not as good as the other.I disagree. Okay, it's not The Wrath of Khan (arguably the most highly-regarded of the original franchise), but then nor are any of the subsequent movies which followed. It is however, the sequel to The Wrath of Khan. With Spock dying at the end of the last film, there had to be some proper conclusions drawn from the sequel. And The Search For Spock does just that.Taking a more modern example, it's like what Quantum of Solace is to Casio Royale in the James Bond franchise. It's basically the end half of Khan, showing us what happened next and tying up the loose ends that were left off regarding the 'Genesis project.' We have Kirk and crew at their most brazen forcibly stealing the Enterprise and going where no man has been allowed to go before, i.e. into a restricted area of space to see if they can resurrect their fallen comrade. Not only that, this is the first (true) outing for the Klingons. Many people don't seem to like Christopher Lloyd's performance as the Klingon leader. Again, I have to disagree. Granted he didn't have much dialogue to work with, but he's a pretty nasty baddie, clearly enjoying slaughtering the goodies indiscriminately and most people will be happy to see the back of him.Star Trek III may not be the greatest of them all, but if you like 'Trek' in general and still pine for those golden days before JJ Abrams rebooted the whole lot, give The Search For Spock a go (and try not to dwell on the fact that he's really directing the whole show from behind the camera - boom boom).

And the destruction of the Enterprise (a touching scene, to be sure) isn't done capriciously; there's actual narrative purpose. It fits with the great character they've made out of Captain Kirk. It's a movie I never paid much attention to when I was younger, buying into the odd-number curse.

The death of Spock (Nimoy) following the battle with Khan left the perfect storyline to follow, as fans would be lining up for the possibility of seeing everyone's favorite Vulcan return. It is discovered that Spock's mind-meld with Dr. McCoy (Kelley) left his katra, his spirit, cohabiting the doctor's mind. Spock voices his request to Kirk through McCoy that he must return to the Genesis planet, formed at the end of II when the Genesis device detonated inside the USS Reliant and the Mutara Nebula. With the Enterprise being decommissioned and the Genesis planet declared forbidden to access, Kirk makes a bold decision and his crew joins him in stealing the Enterprise from space dock to return his best friend's katra to the Genesis planet and ultimately to his home planet Vulcan. Unfortunately, a group of rogue Klingons have gained knowledge of the Genesis device and seek it's secret for its destructive properties.THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK isn't as good as STAR TREK II, but it's still better than THE MOTION PICTURE. The film regains some of the mellow spirituality of the first film while continuing to integrate the action and humor that made the show so fun. My problem with the film was that it bounced between these two qualities and gave the film's pace a stop-and-go feel. The movie moves in bursts of excitement punctuated with long sequences that at times bored me. For example, the final act of the film where the crew arrives at Vulcan with Spock's rapidly matured new physical body was a drawn out ceremony where I found myself checking the time and waiting for it to end. My interest had waned as soon as the movie's main action had ended. The best moments are when everything's moving at an exciting pace as Kirk and his crew hijack the Enterprise or battle the Klingon Bird-of-Prey. I should also mentioned I loved the bar scene near the beginning where McCoy, losing his mind, enters a bar seeking transport to the Genesis planet. You can tell they found their inspiration from the cantina scene in A NEW HOPE and it was a fun sequence giving more screen time to my all-time favorite original series character.The film marks Leonard Nimoy's first time directing a feature film, and I don't think he did too bad. He certainly did the best he could with a story that wasn't the strongest to begin with. It's a shame that even Nimoy himself couldn't wrangle a powerful enough performance out of William Shatner here. It's not that I don't like Shatner's work (he is and always will be the best Kirk there could ever have been), but I have seen now that he has limitations. In this film, Kirk experiences some heavy losses (both pretty crucial plot points that I don't want to spoil here in the event a reader hasn't seen the film) and, while they should've been moments for a heavy dramatic moment, I never felt it. When the Klingons decide to execute a particular captive to prove their seriousness, I never felt the weight of the loss through Shatner's performance. A brief flicker and then BAM, back to the action. It cheapened what could've been a great character moment for the starship captain who's always seemed so invincible. Too bad, it just falls a little flat.Despite Shatner's performance shortcomings in the film, most everything else came together well. Robin Curtis replaced Kirstie Alley as Saavik (I guess her sitcom star status went to her head by this point) and does a well enough job filling her position. But while they lost one TV sitcom comedians, they gained two more Christopher Lloyd and John Larroquette as Klingons. Lloyd is the film's main villain, the Klingon commander Kruge. He actually does a great job and is probably one of the better villains from the movie series, even if it did take me a while to stop associating the voice with Doc Emmett Brown. Speaking of Klingons, the film also introduces my favorite STAR TREK spacecraft the Klingon Bird-of-Prey. I've always loved the design and any chance to see it in action is a treat for me.When the movie is over, I'm happy to say the good outweighs the bad. It has some real slow bits but the parts that standout in my mind are only the best, and it leaves me with an overall good impression. While I'll not say it's the best STAR TREK film, it does have some important moments in series history and it isn't a bad way to spend two hours. Plus, you know, we're reunited with one of the most treasured characters in the franchise's history, even if it does take a while.

Although, that might have been Star Trek II's fault, with the shot of Spock's coffin on Genesis and Leonard Nimoy's monologue. Anyway the film is really just a bridge between Star Trek II and IV, and even though it is the weakest in the trilogy, it is still the best odd numbered entry in the series. Leonard Nimoy made his directorial debut with Star Trek III.Admiral Kirk goes back to Starfleet after his battle with Khan, only to be informed the Enterprise is going to be decommissioned. On top of that, Dr. McCoy is starting to act curiously like Mr. Spock. Kirk and Spock's father Sarek discover that Spock gave Dr. McCoy a mindmeld shortly before he died, so part of him still lives inside McCoy. Sarek pleads to Kirk to bring Spock's body back to Vulcan, but there is a problem. Genesis has been quarantined, and even an Admiral like Kirk is not permitted to go. So Kirk disobeys his orders and steals the Enterprise in an attempt to rescue his friend. To make matters worse, the Klingons are after Genesis.Christopher Lloyd as Commander Kruge makes for a pretty good Klingon. He is no Khan, but he's thoroughly entertaining. I would rather see the Klingons in this movie than what they would become in The Next Generation. Kruge is obsessed with finding Genesis and takes Savik, Kirk's son David, and the newly reborn Spock hostage. Robin Curtis replaces Kirstie Allie as Savik. Her performance is more like a Vulcan but Savik was originally supposed to be part Romulan, which explained her more emotional behavior in Star Trek II. I prefer Allie. Of course, what would a Trek movie be without space battles? The battles aren't as intense as Wrath of Khan but it is fun to see a battle where the Enterprise is not in peak condition. Genesis is obviously a sound stage but I didn't mind. I believe a fire broke out and damaged the set, which might explain the set's quality. III was the first movie Kirk ever got into a hand to hand fight with the main villain, which reminded me of the corny fights from the TV show (I mean that as a complement). The movie is predictable but there are some heart wrenching moments that make it essential for anyone interested in Star Trek. Kirk's son David is killed by the Klingons, creating the source of his prejudice in Star Trek VI and giving us a classic line Klingon bastards killed my son... Kirk is forced to self-destruct the Enterprise (one of the saddest moments in the series) and beam down to Genesis to save his crew. DeForest Kelley's Vulcan behavior is quite amusing. He tries to give people the Vulcan Neck pinch unsuccessfully, and constantly harps about logic. One of Kelley's two best moments of acting in the series is when he talks to the unconscious Spock about how much he's missed him.Spock is brought back to life by an ancient Vulcan ritual, but perhaps the best thing that came from Star Trek III was how it setup the superior Star Trek IV.

Yes, he's the first in a long line of Trek movie villains trying to top Ricardo Montalban's turn as Khan in the second movie. Granted. He's wonderfully over the top.Third, the Destruction of the Enterprise. The first time I saw this screened, there was this wonderful reaction from the audience, where they all laughed as the Klingon Landing Party was blown up on the bridge, then let out a sound of sadness when we realized this iconic ship was being destroyed.Fourth, the death of David.

I had only seen it a couple of times many years ago, so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it the other night. I would rank it about in the middle of the six, and it is the Trek film that most closely recalls the feel and atmosphere of the original TV series. Subdued is how Leonard Maltin describes it, and that's an apt description. Technically, it has all the elements the other films have- humor, cheesiness, action. But the overall mood is almost somber, as though no one's allowed to really enjoy themselves until we get the matter of Spock's death/life resolved. It hangs over the proceedings like a shadow. Even the requisite fight scene between Kirk and the main Klingon takes place in silence, no charging music score in the background for once. By this point in the franchise's re-emergence, it seems everyone was feeling pretty comfortable with the material again and the fact that 'Star Trek' was back to stay, at least for the foreseeable future. After the stiff, pretentious, and unlikeable 'Star Trek- The Motion Picture,' the group quickly rediscovered their focus and returned to form in the tough and exciting 'Wrath of Khan.' In 'Search For Spock,' they've simply turned the volume down a little; other than that, it has all the markings of a reliably entertaining entry in an enduring series. In keeping with the low-key approach, even William Shatner turns in what is for him, a muted performance. There is a particularly nice (if I can describe it as such) scene where he learns that the Klingons have just killed his son, David. He stumbles backward on the bridge and falls, missing his chair. Done the wrong way, it might have looked foolish but Shatner handles it just right; it is believable and touching. That said, there are still some cringe-worthy moments; Shatner can still ham it up with the best of them, as when he delivers his pep-talk to the others before making off with the Enterprise, delivering dialogue corny enough to make all but the most loyal Trekkie's eyes roll. Leonard Nimoy has a small cameo at the end and directs for the first time. It's hard to know how free a hand he was actually given; in any event, he must have acquitted himself satisfactorily to all concerned as he was given the director's chair again for the next Trek project, as well as other movies since. Not surprisingly, he shows a natural empathy for the series' mythology and characters; one might describe his approach as gentle while still allowing for a fair amount of action. Looking back on 'The Search For Spock' now, one realizes that for at least this one film, there was a real sense again of 'Star Trek' being an ongoing adventure, that for the first time in a long time, fans didn't have to worry whether this would be the last time they would see their heroes together. The film was a decently profitable hit at the box office and for the moment, all was right in the 'Star Trek' universe. The bugs had been worked out, everyone was relatively content, and devotees of the series could relax and enjoy the movie, reasonably assured that more films would follow. "},{"Title":"6.4/10?

While often maligned along with its other even-numbered chapters, STAR TREK III THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK is actually a superb chapter in this surprisingly enduring, if somewhat uneven, big-screen franchise. It's short of spectacular special effects and outer-space action, but that's not the point.

Vastly underrated, and the best of the odd-numbered Treks, as another user said.The big problem with this movie is in the editing. The most important plot point, Kirk's stealing of the Enterprise, makes no sense.Why does Kirk steal the Enterprise, anyway? Well, to recover Spock so that his marbles can be taken out of McCoy's head and put back into his own, right? Well yes, but just one problem. How did Kirk know that Spock's body (sans marbles) was alive on Genesis at all? He didn't, and had no reason to even suspect it when he stole the ship. And there's no obvious reason why Spock's *dead* body should be needed to flush out McCoy's head.Earlier drafts of the movie, used in the making of the novelization and comic book version get around this problem by changing the order of events. In the earlier drafts, the scene where Spock's empty tube is discovered on Genesis happens first. In these drafts, the scene that became the movie's opening scene, with Kirk on the bridge, shows him already aware of the discovery of the empty tube and pondering its meaning, something he didn't know at the time in the movie, and never found out at all until he reached Genesis.So, that brings up another question. Why do Vulcans stick their marbles into someone else's head when they're about to die, anyway? On the off chance that the body will be brought back to life by a magic torpedo later on? No, the movie tells us that this re-fusion ceremony hasn't been tried in ages. According to the novelization, the normal use of this Katra stashing process is so that the host body can take the Katra back to the Vulcan Hall of Records, where it can be stored as disembodied information.Nice, but you shouldn't need the dead body to do that. Lots of times the dead body might not be available. The only reason for stealing the Enterprise and going to Genesis is if they have some good reason for thinking that Spock's body might be alive there, something they don't have in the movie the way it was eventually put together. It would have been easy to fix. Simply change the order of a few scenes and add a line or two between Kirk and Sarek. As it is, we just have to imagine that somebody somewhere heard something off-screen that gave them a reason for what they're doing. "},{"Title":"Good!

His wishes are shared with Sarek, who is distressed that the essence of his son's being or something like that could not be carried on. Or something like that.

The old cast are all fantastic and the banter between them sparkles; You're suffering from a Vulcan mind-meld doctor. That green-blooded son of a bitch! It's his revenge for all the arguments he lost! The story doesn't have quite the same tension and drive as that of Wrath of Khan though. Christopher Lloyd makes a good Klingon but as a villain he doesn't come off as particularly threatening or malevolent in the way Montalban's Khan does. He's just a Klingon being a Klingon. But it's a different kind of film, driven less by action and more my character. It's William Shatner who steals the show here as a captain struggling with loss trying preserve the memory and honour of his friend.

Captain James T. Kirk, we learn, is the only person to have ever beaten this no win scenario. How? He reprogrammed the simulator, thereby changing the rules and parameters of the game. As a result, Star Trek 2 had an interesting tension. On one hand we had an egotistical Captain Kirk who repeatedly wins all scenarios, who knows only success, who can't deal with defeat, who always finds a way to break the rules and change the terms of engagement. And on the other hand we had Kirk's confrontation with his own mortality, his learning that with time eventually comes defeat, death and loss. This tension, between life and death, immortality and mortality, daredevil successes and inescapable failures, is epitomised by the Genesis device, a super-weapon in the film which had the power to both create and destroy life.The lesson Kirk learns in Wrath of Khan, a lesson which helped humanise a cast of larger than life superheroes, is undone in Star Trek 3 The Search For Spock. Whilst Kirk's arrogance and ego leads to the death of a character called Spock in Star Trek 2, a pointy eared alien who is also Kirk's best friend, in Star Trek 3 Kirk's devil-may-care arrogance leads to him resurrecting his green blooded buddy. The film's message is that this resurrection comes at a price, that Kirk loses his starship and his own son so that Spock may be reborn, but such losses amount to nothing. His starship is swiftly returned in subsequent episodes (upgraded!) and his son was an annoying brat who we never really got to know anyway. In other words, Kirk beats the Kobayashi Maru and cheats death yet again, but the film tries to pretend otherwise.The 1980s were the golden age of a certain kind of popcorn science fiction movie (Star Wars 5 and 6, Star Trek 2, 3, 4 and 5, The Thing, The Terminator, Mad Max 2, Back To The Future, Aliens, Scanners, ET, Blade Runner, Altered States, The Fly, Videodrome, Tron, Brainstorm, Ghostbusters, Dune, Brazil, Starman, Robocop, Innerspace, Predator, Akira, Critters, Explorers, Daryl, The Last Starfighter, The Quiet Earth, The Final Countdown, 2010, The Abyss, Nausica, Iceman, Short Circuit, Looker, Flight of the Navigator, Bill and Ted etc etc). Most of these didn't take themselves too seriously, and were a stark contrast to New Wave science fiction literature of the late 60s and 70s. Scifi literature itself experienced a resurgence in the mid 80s, with the birth of cyberpunk (William Gibson), a rise in grimy dystopian novels, and a number of great novels by hard SF and speculative fiction authors (Asimov, Clarke, Cherryh, Flynn, Haldeman, Ballard, James Hogan, Niven, Pohl, Kim Stanley Robinson, Carl Sagan, Charles Sheffield, Alan Steele, John Varley). Though the spark was kept alive by various television franchises, in subsequent decades interest in science fiction would dwindle tremendously. The world was now already Sci-Fi, future speculation under capitalism became impossible and technology had become thoroughly banalized.Nevertheless, one of the best of those 1980s popcorn SF movies was Star Trek 2, a film which holds up well today thanks to some fine writing and classy direction by Nicholas Meyer. In comparison, and despite its much larger budget, Star Trek 3 is a mess, actor turned director Leonard Nimoy failing to match Meyer's slick work. His cast turn in good performances, but Nimoy frames (and lights) virtually every shot badly, and he demonstrates no gifts for such a logistically complex project.The film contains a handful of action sequences, but they pale next to the standards set by Meyer, who brought a Hitchcockian sensibility to his set pieces. While Meyer milks the lead ups to conflicts and delights in verbal sparring and battles of wits, Nimoy simply throws money at the screen. The film is so unimaginative that it even climaxes with a literal fist fight. Christopher Lloyd is cast well as a pantomime villain, but unfortunately most of his dialogue is not in English, and even he can't touch the scenery chewing theatrics and cool Shakespeare quoting bad guys of Meyer's films (Meyer directed Star Trek 2 and 6, the best films in the franchise).7.5/10 - Star Trek 3 spends too much of its running time acting like it's dealing with weighty, portentous material, when in reality it's resurrecting caricatures. Though visually inept, the film nevertheless contains several good shots in which Nimoy had no input. Think a brief shot of a starship approaching a space station and another in which a science vessel sails across the screen. The rest of the film's special effects are poorly done, though some of its ship designs are interesting.Worth one viewing.

But before he died he mind melded with McCoy, leaving Spock's spirit and mind (or Katra) within McCoy. So now Kirk and the gang must go and reunite Spock's Katra with Spock's body. Phew!!! Thats quite a complicated story don't you think? Anyway, this movie, although not quite as good as II, III has something much different to offer, its about friendship and loyalty. And in it, it gives the cast to really have a chance to shine. And it shows the wonderful trust and loyalty, that Kirk is not just the leader of the crew, they all care for each other and would take a bullet for each other, especially Kirk. Who goes all out to save his friend Spock,like risking his entire career as well as his crew's careers, by stealing a soon to be decommissioned Enterprise. All in the name of saving Spock. The story is really well put together and just like II the movie has great special effects and music. Though this movie doesn't really rely on Special effects as much as the last two. It also has a great villain, just like II, with Christapher Lloyd, playing the evil commander Kurn. Overall, this is a real quality movie, like I said not quite as good as Wrath of Khan, but it really drives the storyline farther and it has some surprises a plenty. So its a good movie. But how will they end this storyline....

After all, how can the crew search for Spock when we all saw him die in the last film?! Well, it being the great and scientifically advanced future, death is not necessarily the end of the line! Spock's body was jettisoned onto the planet where the Genesis Probe had been deployed in the last film. It seems that Spock's consciousness was deposited into McCoy and they needed to try to find his body as McCoy wasn't particularly happy or useful as a multiple personality. So, they go off to search for the body and see if they can shove the two back together. But, Klingons, lead by the rather amusing Christopher Lloyd (no he does NOT play a combination of a Klingon and Jim Ignatowsky), are waiting in ambush.The film has very similar production values and acting from the last film. About the only negatives is that STAR TREK II was so exciting and bold that this film can't help but pale in comparison. But it's still an exceptional film that fans of the series should enjoy and others should also like if they are open-minded.

Don't accuse me of spoiling it for you. With a title like The Search for Spock you were expecting Spock to be alive? Anyway, The Starship Enterprise picks up a reading there is life on Genesis! Kirk (William Shatner)and the rest of the crew go to investigate and find Spock's coffin is.....empty!The rest I will leave you to discover. What surprised me about Star Trek III is that, like the previous entry, remembers what Star Trek is all about. Special effects are nice, but the human interactions are what makes it great.The film was directed by Leonard Nimoy, who plays Spock. I think the connection helps as Nimoy is able to avoid the trouble that a non-regular could step into (to Nick Meyer's credit, he managed to avoid that as well)and his close relationship to the characters and story add another dimension to the finished film. A lot of the credit also belongs to Harve Bennett, the producer of the previous film and the writer/producer of this one. He could have made an ordinary money trip but he chooses to invest in the characters. The result is a sequel that is just as great as the second film.I always mention my intense disappointment with the first film. Like I've said before, only fans will forgive the many excesses and see the good in that film. But the sequels are a special lot. They appeal to all moviegoers, not just the Trekkies/Trekkers. That doesn't mean that they're perfect, but that there is much to enjoy. Star Trek III was such a success that Nimoy was asked to make another film. The resultant film Star Trek IV The Voyage Home which is the best of them all. More importantly, it opened the doors for other cast members (William Shatner, who directed V and Jonathan Frakes, who directed First Contact and Insurrection and is going to direct the tenth one) to direct entries. That's as it should be because who else knows about the series than its regulars?**** out of 4 stars "},{"Title":"Good sequel.","Date":"21 December 2007","Score":"4 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" Most Star Trek fans and critics often agree the odd-numbered Star Treks do not fare well at the movies. For the third installment of Star Trek, we find the a stand-out. The Search for Spock is a good, well-made film that is more philosophical, laid-back, and introspective. Within it, we find faithfulness, friendship. Most impressive is the mix between action with the theme of exploration of the unknown. It begins right after Star Trek II. The Enterprise returns to Earth without the famed Captain Spock. Bones if found in Spock's quarters having some sort of psychotic episode. When Kirk returns to Earth, Sarek asks him about his Katra or soul. Unable to find it, Kirk realizes McCoy is carrying his first mate. After pleading with Starfleet to return to the Genesis Planet to retrieve Spock's body, he learns Genesis is a hotbed of controversy and no more ships are allowed in the vicinity. Meanwhile, the USS Grissom, headed by David Marcus and Saviik, is exploring the Genesis Planet. It is eroding because of an unstable matter used in the matrix. They do find Spock, who is somehow linked to the planet's instability. They have to get him off. Unfortunately, the Grissom was destroyed by Captain Kruge, a Klingon who is looking for fame and glory. He wants Genesis to arm his people against the Federation. It is up to Kirk, McCoy, Scotty and the others to steal the USS Enterprise. They return to the Genesis planet. What I liked about this one was not only the subtle philosophical messages of loyalty and life, but also the performances in this movie. I credit this to director Leonard Nimoy who shows restraint in the action, and also manages to deliver philosophy deftly. Finally, there is depth both in exploration and disappointment. Probably the most unusual thing I found was that William Shatner does not give into his instinct to over-act. He gives restrained performance. And Christopher Lloyd gives the greatest performance as a Klingon. I will say the resolution was drawn out a little too long, but other than that, The Search for Spock has enough subtlety to intrigue, and enough action to keep us interested.

This film was a logical progression from what came before. Shatner (admittedly not an Olivier) nonetheless handles the character of James T. Kirk very well, and never better than in this episode. Deforest Kelly was at his finest as McCoy. Christopher Lloyd and John Lithgow were excellent as Klingon villains. But it was the hand of Leonard Nimoy who both helped write the script and direct to bring his knowledge of this Star Trek universe together in a manner that could not be expected from someone not intimately involved with it. Paramount Studios never seem to learn their lesson. No matter how much money the Star Trek series or films rake in, they seem to be bound to try and destroy the whole concept. Always miserly with a budget, the directors of the films in particular have had to be extra creative to manage a film on a lot less than they should have been allowed. Despite this Nimoy, to my mind the best director of Star Trek, did an admirable job of directing and acting in this feature.

In the wake of the Genesis Project, the planet is now closed to all but the science teams which are studying the Genesis Effect on what is now termed the Genesis Planet.They've decommissioned the Enterprise and Kirk can't get an answer as to whether the crew will get another ship, or be split up and reassigned. Meanwhile, Sarik, Spock's father, shows up for a personal visit with Kirk, concerning the condition of Spock's soul. He is certain that Spock would have housed his soul with Kirk, but upon a mind-meld, Sarik determines that Spock is not present within Kirk. And such is the loss to Sarik. He will be unable to resurrect his son, or to properly salvage his living soul since Spock was not in a position to touch Kirk at his time of death.Back on the Genesis Planet, the science team has discovered Spock's burial tube which soft-landed on the planet's surface. And there is an unidentifiable animal life form present nearby. There should not be any life, animal or otherwise, since Genesis destroys all life forms wherever it is targeted, therefore this is of key concern to the science team, who sends down an investigative crew immediately.Kirk and Sarik determine that Spock melded with McCoy before he died, and in order for McCoy to be well again, and Spock's soul to be saved from oblivion, Kirk has to break McCoy out of the psychiatric unit where he is recovering from exhaustion, steal a star ship, get McCoy to Mt. Selia on Vulcan for a Vulcan religious magickal rite which will separate the two souls from one another, and thereby save them both; face a court martial for stealing a star ship, disobeying direct orders and possibly treason against Star Fleet.Ah, but I haven't told half the story, nor spoiled anything but the first 10 or so minutes of the movie. This is a fantastic installment! and I won't spoil anymore of it for you.The effects are even better than those in the Wrath of Khan, as there are some excellent elements here and the story picks up right where the Wrath of Khan left off.

Star Trek III Search for Spok, does get panned by more then a few trek fans. That is very, very sad. Star Trek was one of those that seemed to get better with each passing movie. Each one had a message.This one took a road that had never been really traveled before. Whereas one expected a hero's welcome for the gallant Enterprise crew. A welcome well deserved for their defeat of the ruthless Kahn, the rescue of the poor Reliant's crew. And, quite by a stroke of luck, the launch of the project known as, Genesis.Instead, Kirk is greeted with a cold reality. He's told by command that the Enterprise is to be decommissioned, and her crew, to go their separate ways. For all that they had done. Even with the loss of Spok still on their minds, they get hit with the worst bit of reality. Age has caught with them.They also deal with McCoy's rapidly declining mental status. ENter Sarek, who seeks answers to Spock's death. He thinks that Spock mind melded with Kirk, for Kirk was the last one Spock had contact with.Turns it that it's McCoy, in a great show of Irony, that Spock melded with. Despite all the banter they endure, now Spock and McCoy are one.Now it's up to the Enterprise crew to not only save McCoy, but save Spock as well. And unbeknown to Kirk, Savvik and Kirk's son David are held hostage by renegade Klingons, seeking the Genesis devoice for their own means.What happens next lays the ground work for the next series of movie. This is the best set up of sequels perhaps ever done. David's death at the hand of the klingons fuels Kirk's hatred towards them. This serves as a key point in the Undiscovered Country, when the Klingon's seeking peace after their moon explodes, are attacked. All the blame is laid at Cpt. Kirk. Kirk is used by renegade star fleet members looking to pro long the Klingon federation war. The rescue of Spock actually paves the way for Kirk and his crew to save mankind when Earth is attacked by a space probe in Star Trek IV the Voyage home.The movie moves along at a great pace, and always keeps the viewer interested. It also expands the klingons, as well. It makes them a little more, shall we say, human, in their own sadistic way.And it also contains the classic exchange where Kirk sends the Klingon Captian, played to perfection by Christopher Lloyd, where Kirk send the Klingon to his death, saying I have had enough of you! This is one of the best Star Trek films ever made, and deserves to be treated as such.

The villains of the film were originally intended to be Romulans, but upper studio management wanted Klingons to be used since they were better-known enemies. By the time the decision was made, the Romulan ship was already built and they did not want the expense of replacing it. However, since the original Star Trek (1966) series had already established that the Klingons and Romulans had shared technologies and ships in the past (for exactly the same real-world cost-cutting reasons), the idea of Klingons using a Romulan-style vessel was not a problem . The motion picture has a climatic and spectacular ending . Stirring final amazing the spectator , in which the moving and spectacular scenes create a perfect union that terminates with an ending that leaves you stuck in the armchair facing the formidable spectacle as a privileged witness .

Many people have said that the odd numbered Star Trek movies are bad, I,III,V,VII,IX and the even numbered Star Trek movies are good, II,IV,VI,VIII,X, but I actually like both. The odd and even Star Trek movies are both entertaining in their own ways, Star Trek III The Search for Spock is good for one of the odd numbered sequels. It may have been an excuse to bring Spock into the films again but think about it, Star Trek wouldn't be the same without Lenord Nimoy's performance as Spock, he gave the films a charm since his character couldn't understand emotion only logic and him trying to understand Kirk and Bones emotions and sayings was always amusing. So in a way they needed to have Spock in the Star Trek movies again otherwise it wouldn't have that same feel.The film still has some good effects like the previous movies, the acting is great, Christopher Llyod does a great performance as the main villain. Star Trek III was also the first Star Tek film to be directed by one of the cast members, Lenord Nimoy who would later direct Star Trek IV The Voyage Home, William Shatner then decided to be a director on one of the Star Trek movies with Star Trek V The Final Frontier, on the Next Generations Star Trek movies Johnathan Frakes would direct Star Trek First Contact and Star Trek Insurecction. Lenord Nimoy does a good job directing this movie since he captures the style of Star Trek perfectly, William Shatner and Johnathan Frakes also did a good job captured the style of Star Trek but in their own different ways.The film sees the Enterprise returning to the base after their encounter with Khan from the previous Star Trek film, as they're returning home Kirk finds someone in Spock's quarters which had been locked up, Kirk discovers a man hidden in the darkness talking like Spock and when pulls him up he finds that it's Bones. At the base the Father of Spock comes to meet with Kirk and tells him that although Spock's body is dead his essence is alive and he believes that he may have placed it in Kirk but after a mind meld he discovers that he didn't. Meanwhile Bones starts acting more crazy as if Spock was inside him, Kirk discovers that Spock placed his essence in Bones before he sacrificed himself to save the Enterprise. Meanwhile the Klingons learn about the Genesis device and want to take it for themselves since it could be used as a powerful weapon, a Federation ship monitors the Genesis planet. Savik and David check the progress of the planet and discover that it's forming life at a fast speed, they also pick up a life sign on the planet, they go onto the Genesis planet to track the signal and soon discover that the planet has regenerated Spock's tissue making him alive again. At the base Kirk is not permitted to go and get Spock since the planet is quarantined but he decides to go against them and hijack the Enterprise to get him anyway with the help of his trusty crew. On the Genesis planet Spock is ageing at an accelerated speed due to the planet's again, the Genesis planet is destroying itself and if Spock doesn't get out the planet he'll die with it. Kirk must try and rescue Spock while fighting the Klingons that want to take Genesis for themselves.Star Trek III The Search for Spock is a great sequel that's slightly underrated.

When I first saw him, as Reverend Jim Ignatowski, I was very young, and his presence was very memorable. As with Sean Penn as Jeff Spicoli in Fast Times At Ridgemont High, it takes several different performances to truly grasp his range.The rest of the cast? If you have to ask....The plot? If you have to ask...okay, this time the crew goes on a mission to find Spock, whose mind has been placed in Dr. McCoy for safekeeping while his body chilled out at the Genesis spa. Only a vulcan ritual can make everything right, but first the crew has to retrieve Spock's body from Genesis, and in doing so they encounter the evil Klingon commander Kruge (Lloyd).The special effects on this film were subpar, particularly the fight scenes on the exploding Genesis planet; I've seen better special effects with fire on a soap opera. That's acceptable, however, since when the film came out, we needed Spock to return to the living, though today's audiences wouldn't understand the significance of having killed him off at the end of II.To those who don't know, when Kruge says I come all this way for Genesis, and this is what I find, Lloyd is in the character of Reverend Jim from Taxi, and the theater I was in exploded in laughter at the time; this joke would be lost on anyone who hasn't seen that series. All that was missing was Danny DeVito as a space dispatcher or Andy Kaufman as an alien.Whereas Star Trek I tilted a little too much towards the hardcore fan base, and Star Trek II was perfect for everyone (by far the best of the series), Star Trek III was a decent film that satisfied the intense cravings of Trekkies (not Trekkers, as there was no shame in being a Trekkie back then) for more footage of the famous crew of space pioneers. This was before the internet, before cable and even video stores (almost), and when all we had were the 78/79 episodes that were in reruns and which we had memorized every line to. I left the theater pleased with the film, knowing it could have been better, but it also could have been far worse.Perhaps the film's greatest achievement is that it was obviously made to cash in on the growing rerun audience from the series, yet it still managed to be superior to most episodes, while stacking up decently against every other Trek film ever made, except for Star Trek II and First Contact.If you're a hardcore fan, buy the DVD; if not, catch it on cable.

In the wake of Spock's death Bones is acting a little funny, kind of like he thinks he's Spock or something (and they play this scenario for all the comic gold it's worth). Spock's father turns up to meet Kirk and tells him it was a really bad idea to shoot Spock's body into space because he needs to perform a Vulcan ritual on his dead son using his essence, that Spock must have given to Kirk using some type of mind meld. Of course it turns out it was Bones who received Spock's essence as Kirk wasn't around.As luck would have it, Spock's body has landed on the planet infected by the Genesis bomb detonated by Khan in the climax of the previous movie. Genesis has the ability to create life when there was none, and increase life where there is already some, so Spock is risen from the dead, though he doesn't have his essence as it is inside Bones.Kirk decides to steal the Enterprise, make his way to the Genesis planet, so he can find Spock. Sulu gets to act like a bad ass and Uhura and Scotty come along for the ride too.Unfortunately for Kirk, Klingon Commander Kruge (Christopher Lloyd, quality) also finds out about Genesis and so he goes to the same place looking to kick some federation ass along the way. Kruge sees Genesis as the ultimate weapon as it has the power to wipe all life from the face of a living planet. Things get personal as Kirk kills half of Kruge's crew (blowing up the Enterprise in the process) and Kruge kills Kirk's son (who was one of the designers of the Genesis technology). The film kind of misses out from not having Kruge develop as well as Khan in the previous film, and they are forced to go for the high stakes in an attempt to flesh out some real hatred between Kirk and the villain, and it just about works.Kirk defeats Kruge in a one on one battle as Genesis falls to pieces, proving the technology isn't stable. He escapes with essence-less Spock and they go to Vulcan where Spock gets his soul back and then remember who Kirk and the rest of the crew are.This is a pretty decent medium budget 80s sci fi film. It was the first time celebrated composer James Horner (Aliens, Braveheart) was given the keys to composing the soundtrack to a blockbuster. There are some really bad bits, like Shatner's silly I ... have had...enough...of you!!! But deforest Kelly is actually really good and a lot of fun in this one, and Lloyd is there to make his scenes entertaining.They say that dead actors, writers or artists live on for as long as people keep partaking and appreciating their work, and it is kind of appropriate, to bring Nimoy back to life for 90 minutes watching him play a character who is dead and rises back to life. This one breaks the curse of odd numbered Star Trek films and is well worth a look.To all who miss Nimoy, may you live long and prosper, and to the great man himself Rest in Peace.

Kirk (William Shatner) is still trying to cope with the death of his friend. However, he soon finds that Spock put his memory inside McCoy (DeForest Kelley), and sets off on the old Enterprise with his companions to return Spock's mind to his body, despite Star Fleet orders to keep away from Genesis. Meanwhile, a Klingon captain named Kruge (Christopher Lloyd) learns of Genesis, and sets out to find its creators and formula.Star Trek The Motion Picture was a special effects movie, a sort of (very) low-rate Star Wars. Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan is traditional Star Trek, a story of characters and abstract science fiction. The Search for Spock is a combination of the two. The movie has good visual effects, and delves into Genesis and its capabilities more than Wrath of Khan. Genesis itself is a very creative idea, and I especially like the idea of it being able to revive Spock, even if defeats the purpose the ending of Wrath of Khan.All of the Star Trek cast are in character. It does feel like a return to Trek. The movie is witty and creative, even if does not measure up to Wrath of Khan.The Search for Spock is quite dramatic at times. There are moments of major sacrifice. Kirk and the rest of his crew are willing to sacrifice their careers to save Spock, and it's actually quite touching. Kirk's son David sacrifices his life to save Spock and Saavik. I don't think I'm giving anything away when I say that Kirk destroys the Enterprise. This scene is shocking. Seeing the trademark of Star Trek destroyed is totally unexpected, and quite dramatic and sad.The movie is rather slow-paced at times, and takes a while to get going, so don't expect a thriller like Wrath of Khan.Christopher Lloyd is perfect as a Klingon captain. He's born to play a villain or crazy guy, and Kruge is both. However, Christopher Lloyd overshadows the character. Kruge is a fun villain, but he's something of a disappointment after Khan, one of the greatest villains of all time.The movie succeeds as being a worthy entry to Star Trek, and an entertaining and well-made film in its own right. Don't expect it to be as good as Wrath of Khan, but I do think this movie is underrated and fun.

Not an easy task for those who tackle it. The challenge is to keep fans happy, while taking things in a new direction. 'Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan' was a vast improvement over it's ambitious, but seriously flawed predecessor. It was going to be a tough act to follow, especially considering how it ends.

Plot full of twists and turns. Most of the effects are good. Fast paced all the way. Some good touches of humor. Nice production design, especially on the planet.Cons Some dated visuals. Christopher Lloyd does fine, but isn't very menacing here. The killing off of a certain character was too soon.Final thoughts Many feel that the odd numbered 'Trek' films are the weakest.

Basically it continues where Wrath of Khan left off, where the Enterprise are returning home to repair the damages, but they are shocked to hear that the ship will instead be scrapped. Dr. Leonard Bones McCoy (DeForest Kelley) starts acting very strangely, and Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner) has a visit from Spock's father, Vulcan Ambassador Sarek (Mark Lenard) who knows the living spirit, or Kattra, of Spock is inside Bones. After getting no permission to go from Admiral Morrow (Robert Hooks), Kirk and the crew steal the Enterprise and begin the journey back to the restricted planet Genesis where Spock's body was blasted. Two crew members have already managed to land on the planet, finding a fast growing child, then teen, then man, who may in fact be the new Spock ready to have his Kattra returned. On the journey, the Enterprise comes into contact with the Klingons, led by Cmdr. Kruge (Christopher Lloyd) as they plan to steal the secrets of the Genesis. After killing Kirk's son, he tricks the Klingons onto the Enterprise, and blow them up inside, before proceeding to the Vulcan ceremony. The Vulcans manage to carry out the potentially fatal task of removing the Kattra from Bones, and the new body of Spock has the Kattra returned, and the film ends with Spock (Leaonard Nimoy) starting to remember one or two things. Also starring James Doohan as Montgomery Scotty Scott, George Takei as Hikaru Sulu, Walter Koenig as Pavel Chekov and Nichelle Nichols as Cmdr. Uhura. The special effects might not be as great as the previous film, and the story is patchy in places, but as an overall it is a good continuation, and it certainly makes you want to see the next part. Star Trek was number 41 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and Mr. Spock was number 23 on The 100 Greatest TV Characters. Worth watching!

Most of the leads are great in their famous roles, though I kinda wanted to see more scenes with Uhura. I did like the Mr. Adventure scene with her.Obviously, you're kinda itching to find out what my opinion on Christopher Lloyd's Kruge is. Well.... I kinda classify this role as not his best, nor his worst. I forgive him though, since this movie was before his most famous role (which I'm not going to say because you probably all know).Leonard Nimoy (hopefully I'm spelling this right)'s directing isn't bad (really bad is probably what some think of Will Shatner's directing), but it's hard to find a distinct style of his in the movie. I do understand it was one of his first times as director.I really love James Horner's score, giving the movie a whimsical but still sci-fi feel to the film, oddly leaving out the Star Trek movie theme (not the TV show theme), but thankfully not sounding too pretty in the scenes of danger.Well, there you have it.

Kirk and crew find out that Starfleet plan to discontinue the mission of the old Enterprise making a path for the Excelsior, supposedly a vast superior vessel in speed and engineering. Just the thought of this ship being superior to the Enterprise fuels Scotty's anger as he is told that his work would continue on seeing the new ship becoming completely operational. Meanwhile, Spock's father Sarek visits Kirk claiming that he had no right to torpedo his son's remains to the developing planet Genesis. He claims that despite Spock's physical death, his essence, spirit even, is still alive. Kirk finds, through checking computer logs, that Spock had mind-melded with Bones before giving sacrificing himself for the Enterprise and their crew. So all the marbles(as Bones eloquently puts it)is in Bones' mental framework where it doesn't belong.That takes us to the Genesis planet where the science vessel, Grissom, is orbiting collecting data. When they indeed notice a life-form present on the planet, Kirk's son David and Lt. Saavik(portrayed by Kirstie Alley in the previous film, now played by Robin Curtis)go to the planet surface. That's where David realizes he made a mistake in trying to speed up the planet's evolutionary process not only endangering lives but the very planet itself. They come to find Spock as a child and that he is growing(Vulcan's growth is very painful and unusual.)..and that his growth is linked with the planet and that it is slowly coming apart at the seams.To top the whole film off is a renegade, power-hungry Klingon Commander Kruge who wishes to use the Genesis torpedo as a weapon. He believes Starfleet plan to use that torpedo as a secret weapon showing he doesn't use his brain as much as primal instinct with power and domination clouding anything else. We see him destroy anything that even mildly disrupts his order of doing things and the will to kill to get a hold of the torpedo is strong.The film shows that Kirk will disobey orders from Starfleet Command to keep the Enterprise decommissioned(and, thus, staying far away from the planet Genesis)so that he can find Spock. He will, of course, cross paths with Kruge in a battle of wills..and also suffer tragedy during this unfortunate struggle. But, Spock and Bones will have to go through a difficult emotional ceremony to see if Spock's mind can meld with his fully grown body.This film is in the vein of the previous trek adventure. It isn't as great as the second film, but provides us with another formidable villain in Christopher Lloyd's Kruge. We see the slow transformation and evolution of Spock as David and Saavik watch the planet tear away around them. We really get a chance to see the new, far-more-sinister form of Klingon and the film shows us the unfortunate demise of the great Enterprise vessel. Shatner is in fine form as Kirk. Considering the plot of Genesis and the evolution of the Vulcan..this is merely a concoction to bring a beloved character back from the dead.

This film lingers in a lot of places, such as all the added on stuff with the research crew and the Excelsior speech. This film also lacks Uhura. She is only graced with being in two scenes. While I know both scenes are vital, I feel that it is inane that she was left out of 90% of the movie. I think all of these down falls where because of Leonard Nimoy. As a first time director his skill was untested and unrefined. If they had went with a more seasoned vet they would have got a better product. He does however use his knowledge of the Star Trek universe to create a good story that does bridge the gap to the better and more successful Star Trek IV The Voyage Home, where Nimoy honed his skills and let all of his mistakes from this film go out the bridge. This film should be noted for it's inclusion of legendary actor Cristopher Loyd. He does a fine performance here having just came from Taxi. While not as good an antagonist as Ricardo Maltaban's Kahn, Christopher's Kurg is a decent foil to Kirk's wit. Watch this movie if you went to know the whole evolution of Star Trek, but stick with II, IV, and VIII if you wish to see some ultimate future entertainment.

The second was a major disappointment, because I was kind of hoping that a Little Kirk was in the making to carry on the torch (Since Merrit Buttrick was dying of AIDS, this is why he was probably killed off).  The third was outstanding because I do not think this has ever happened before in Star Trek (In another episode of the TV series, someone else played Kirk, but Bill Shatner was still there and became Kirk at the end--I do not know if this counts or not)This episode probably achieved the best balance between mysticism and the earthly that Star Trek is most famous for.

The film is going on 25 years in age; we've had an entirely new generation of both film and televisual Star Trek crews, not to mention a reboot, so much so that to spoil what to many is the best in the early series of films for the franchise in Wrath of Khan and to reveal why it is the search for Spock is on is perhaps forgivable. The film has very little time for those coming to the series afresh, informing us of exactly how it was the second edition from two years previously concluded the slow demise of Leonard Nemoy's Vulcan character Spock, an act of bravery seeing him succumb to exposure to radioactivity when the entire crew needed him most, greeting us here upon arrival. The third Star Trek film, entitled The Search for Spock, provides a new adventure which runs on emotion for an old friend and effectively enough entwines into proceedings a fresh villain that works just as well if not better than Khan did as well as retaining that sense of adventure and journeying into the unknown both previous films had. To the point upon when it was released, it is the best of the three Star Trek films.Age was the primary issue the indomitable Captain Kirk (Shatner) was previously pent up about, that being the mid-life crisis he was suffering in Wrath of Khan when the identifying he was getting old; that he was old enough to mentor up-and-coming cadets and that his crew were old and that defeating an old nemesis from years ago helped him feel young and relevant again, grief is essentially the new emotion or item that is now taking centre stage in the man's life. The film will begin, following its revealing sequence of said last entry, with some delicate tracking shots of forestry that accompanies shots of Spock's coffin lying dormant in the plush vegetative locale of planet Genesis; Genesis being a planet renovated by an item designed to transform dead planets and moons into plush, jungle infested Utopia's upon which life can grow and evolution may unfold. A later twist reveals that the turning of a dead planet into this new Eden went wrong, and the item of evolution is running rampant therein. The camera appears to enjoy settling on an odd angle looking directly up at the sky from the coffin's level, suggesting a point of view of some kind &#x96; perhaps from a person, maybe even from Spock himself. The composition more resembles the first thing the individual inside of the coffin might see upon opening the lide.As things transpire, the shooting out of Spock's corpse to the planet Genesis was the incorrect procedure upon which beings of Spock's species carry out; the transferring of details on what should have happened was not properly transfered unto Spock's closest friend Kirk, instead to McCoy (Kelley), so now the correcting of this error must be reconciled. Some amusing exchanges later, and the direct disobeying of orders so as to honour a dear friend's request, Kirk and a handful of his crew ship out in a barely patched up Enterprise that's ready for scrapping anyway. Kirk is only recently warned that his emotions will one day override his lateral thinking abilities and it'll be for the worse; the high-jacking of the vessel and the tampering with the ship employed to chase after them enough material, you'd assume, to court-marshal the man to a lengthly degree.The villain of the piece is a character named Kruge, played really effectively by Christopher Lloyd, who's a Klingon commander in charge of his own ship and crew whom is after the Genesis weapon. Kruge inhabits a bridge lit to the shade of blood red, a small weaselly little monster with scales more resembling a dragon occupying the space around his feet; Kruge being the kind of creature whom blasts those inhabiting another ship following their supplying him with aid and then a fellow crew mate when they are unable to carry out correct procedure. Kruge's a disgruntled and dishevelled little being and Lloyd provides us with a wonderful villain; someone running on the same goals as Khan did in the previous film but coming across as meaner; more menacing and without the revenge tract that blighted Khan's arc. He verbally berates what the worlds and the lifestyles of Starfleet either represent or themselves come to desire, the creating of new planets and the imperialistic expansion of territories and ways of life that entails. Where Kirk and his one time nemesis Kruge share common ground is Kirk's own refusal to be bogged down by his own corporation's rules and regulations when his request to rectify Spock's burial is dismissed; Kirk's reaction being what it is.The Search for Spock combines a real sense of thrilling adventure with careful and precise observations on character, doing so in a manner that the previous two films are unable to match. It takes what was best about the first two and combines them into a really nourishing package; the sense of adventure and the feeling of discovering the unknown from the first that the second lacked with the escalated sense of exterior conflict The Wrath of Khan had, but which the 1979 film didn't really posses. The film is exciting, tense and comes with an array of really likable leads at the centre; the leader of whom runs on an emotional tract of honour and grief which is really rather well done &#x96; needless to say, it is worthiest entry in the franchise up to this point and came as a real surprise.

Five minutes in, while we're all still bawling our eyes out over the recap of Spock's death, Kirk delivers this whopper of a line.

Before he even knows Spock's body's still alive, He's willing to steal the Enterprise, commit treachery in the eyes of the Federation, and disobey direct Starfleet orders -- in short, give up his career -- just to make sure his final rites as a Vulcan are properly carried out.~ Out of everyone standing there on MT.

In confusing evolution with aging, the author also somehow has the Genesis Effect converting Spock's very-dead carcass into a very live Vulcan infant. Darwin probably rolls in his grave every time someone plays this movie.The helpless Spock-infant somehow survives without a mother to nurse and feed and protect it from the nasty worm-eel-things that somehow evolved from microbes in Spock's coffin, and proceeds to age in surges with the planet, through adolescence to adulthood, conveniently culminating in an adult Spock just in time to beam-up as the planet self- destructs.Aside from writers Roddenberry and Bennett apparently getting their evolution science from a home-schooled Creationist, there's an excessive and faulty reliance on what speculative fiction authors call suspension of disbelief.Suspension of disbelief (setting aside reader's / viewer's objections to fantastic, implausible, and improbable story elements) is generally accomplished through good storytelling, as in a Kurt Vonnegut or Larry Niven story. The previous installment, Wrath of Khan, accomplished this quite well.Problem is, in this case the writers don't even try, instead placing the onus on the viewerIf they wanted to keep Spock, they should not have killed him off in the first place - after all, it wasn't a critical story element to Wrath of Khan.The final insult, is that in resurrecting Spock, they repeat the mistake and destroy the Enterprise, which itself is as central a character to the series. So naturally, they had to resurrect it with a replacement in the following installment.Basically, the movie is a homage to bad writing and indecision.
