[{"Title":"Unique and twisted","Date":"14 March 2004","Score":"77 out of 87 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" This is one of the sickest and most depraved horror films of its time, and I love every minute of it. Where other films had only touched on the barest suggestion of the link between sex and death, Hellraiser shoves that fact right in your face.Frank Cotton (who starts out the film as the main character) is a soulless man who lives only for life's pleasures. He will go to great lengths to satisfy his lusts, and thinks nothing of who he may be stepping on to get there. He is offered a small, strange puzzle box called The Lament Configuration by a strange man in what looks and sounds to be a Mid Eastern market. The box, he is promised, will open the gates to a world of pleasures that no mortal can possibly imagine. Frank takes the box, but he doesn't understand that the pleasures the box offers are to the demons who live within it. The Cenobites, sadomasochistic creatures who live eternally beyond the gates that the box can open and close, take great pleasure in ensnaring new human victims to toy with, imprisoning them forever in a labyrinth of pain and suffering. Frank disappears, and many months later, his brother and sister-in-law come to live in the abandoned home.The film then switches gears and gives us a new main character Julia. Julia, the wife of Frank Cottons brother Larry, is a cold woman. Beautiful and immaculate, she is icy and distant and seems to derive no pleasure from anything, least of all her husband and his daughter from a previous marriage, Kirsty. Julia's only private joy are the memories she has of Frank, with whom she once had an affair. Frank seems to be the only man who was never intimidated by Julia, treating her roughly and breaking down her defenses. Little does Julia know that Frank never left the house; he is upstairs, in the attic, having escaped from the Cenobites and now biding his time until he can return to a world of flesh and blood. When Larry accidentally injures himself and bleeds on the floor of the attic, Frank is brought back, feeding on the fluid and slowly regenerating, growing back bones, muscle and skin. Julia soon discovers the terrible secret in the attic. After her initial shock and disgust, she agrees to help Frank, for whom she still lusts, and begins bringing him men she picks up in bars. She bludgeons them to death and Frank feeds on them, each one helping him in his regeneration.The film then switches points of view once more and Kirsty becomes the main character. Kirsty, who has never liked the pretentious, frigid Julia, becomes suspicious. Her suspicions are soon confirmed when she comes face to face with Uncle Frank and barely escapes his bloody clutches, the Lament Configuration in her hand. She accidentally opens it, and when the demons within, led by the now-famous Pinhead, threaten to take her back with them to their dimension, she makes a deal she will lead them to Frank, and they can have him instead of her. From there on out, it is a countdown; will Kirsty find Frank in time? Can her father be saved from the adulterous couple plotting against him in his own house? Or will it be too late for all of them?This is another sex-equals-death film, but with a slightly updated feel. Julia is Bad; she cheats on her husband and likes her sex rough. Kirsty is Good, but she is no virgin, living with her boyfriend and eagerly engaging in premarital sex. Larry, a dull-as-paste husband who seems to genuinely love his wife but doesn't quite understand how to treat a woman, falls victim to his own blandness. He never sees what's coming because he possesses no imagination, no foresight; he is just the everyday, mundane man mowed under by his own unspectacular existence. Frank is the ultimate Bad; he is a user. He likes sadism, but not when it is turned on him. The Cenobites are the real reason this film was so successful; expressionless zombies in black leather and fetish wear. Led by the majestic Pinhead, they come into our world equipped with chains and hooks and all manner of painful devices, literally ripping their victims apart without batting an eye. They are what Frank wants to be, but Frank is not strong enough. He collapses beneath the weight of his own ego; he wants to think he is a god, but he is only an insect after all.This film received an X rating when it was first released, but seems pretty tame now. The gore effects are only a tad dated, but they're still quite shocking. I think the X rating might have been due more to the films unrelenting sadism than anything else. It's sick and remorseless, but that's not to say it's bad. It's innovative. Nothing like it had been seen up to that time, and it still remains an original. It never imitates; it's all fresh and frighteningly new and should be appreciated for that if nothing else. Followed by one pretty good sequel and a handful of really bad ones, this first installment remains the best. Should be seen at least once.

Simple, or so Frank thought.What results is a cinematic masterpiece, a great mix of gore and violence, as well as a great musical score and some nice drama.  The acting is fine, but there are imperfections. One common complaint The characters are not pleasant enough we can latch onto them.  Maybe that's because these seem more realistic than the characters we CAN latch onto.  Just a thought, don't jump on this.What really gets me, though, is the people calling it down, saying it's not quality entertainment.  Come on guys, if it was SUPPOSED to be Shakespeare, it would not advertise as being able to tear your soul apart.The presence of the cenobites was originally intended not to carry the story but to emphasize it.  As usual, the sequaes ignored it.  Hey, merchandizing.This is the only one of the series that depends on the story more than the demons.  We hardly ever see the infamous Pinhead at all.all in all, this was a fun movie.  No Shakespeare, but it's not supposed to be.  Just dramatic, gory, groundbreaking horror, delivered to us excellently by Mr. Barker.

It was different because this was the first time that I've seen the film since reading Clive Barker's novel The Hellbound Heart. The novel both enhanced my enjoyment for the film, and exposed some of its flaws. With the book, Barker really allows the reader to get inside the character's head, which ensures that the horror is more shocking. His descriptions are also a lot more macabre than what is shown in the film, and the way that certain things in the book are missed out/abridged shows some of the wasted opportunities of the story. This isn't really a criticism of the film, but rather of books being turned into movies on the whole. People often say that the book is better than the movie; and in this case it's true! Even so, Hellraiser is an absolute classic horror film, and easily one of the best of the eighties; not to mention all time. The plot simply follows Frank Cotton. Frank is a man in search of unknown pleasures, and in order to achieve that he buys a mysterious music box. This box does give out pleasure; but it's inflicted by a band of demons, known as 'Cenobytes' - and their idea of pleasure differs from Frank's! The story picks up when Frank's brother and his girlfriend, Julia, move into the house where Frank was taken...The main reason Hellraiser stands out among horror films is because of its themes. Barker weaves shades of love, eroticism and, of course, pain and pleasure into his tale of demons and scarred flesh - and this really makes the film. We can care for the characters and what happens to them because of what Barker puts between them, and it's always evident that this film is head and shoulders above the rest of the schlock-horror sub-genre. The special effects, particularly on the screen time surrounding Frank, are simply stunning and show how real effects beat all this CGI rubbish hands down, while also showing that a low budget can be overcome. The film is never gratuitous with its gore or effects either, and everything in this film is there because it has to be. This is what annoys me about non-horror fans - films like this are dismissed by them because they're too gory or stupid - but Hellraiser breaks the mould because it's a truly original story and the way that Barker implements a macabre love story amidst a plethora of shocking horror is extremely skilfully handled, and more than challenges many of the so-called 'A-class' films.A writer directing his own work tends to ensure that it will get proper treatment, and this is mostly true here. Some things have been changed from the book for no apparent reason (mostly with the characters of Larry and Kristy), but the only thing that really annoyed me was the ending. I suppose it's due to the time that it was made, but the ending feels tacked on to me. Barker's ending in the book was perfectly judged - just open enough to hint at more, while closing the story enough so that the reader is satisfied. Here, we have a schlock finale that is entertaining, but pulls away from the closed atmosphere that Barker has spent the film creating. This film differs from most other eighties horror films because of the fact that the actors are a talented bunch. You come to expect bad acting from this sort of film - but Hellraiser has none of it! The entire cast shine, with Clare Higgins making the biggest impression as the evil Julia. This was Clive Barker's directorial debut, and at times, it's clear that this is the case; but Barker makes the best of his locations, and while his camera sometimes feels enclosed; it fuses with the tragic music brilliantly, and all this helps the film to create that fabulous atmosphere so convincingly.Overall, I have pointed out a couple of flaws here; but I really can't bring myself to give this masterpiece any less than full marks. The originality on display throughout Hellraiser is astounding, as is the atmosphere and the performances pulled out of the actors, along with the fact that this film has entertained me many times and is still as good today as the first time I saw it. All of this ensures that Hellraiser will be an endearing favourite of mine for the rest of my life. If you consider yourself a fan of horror and haven't seen this; shame on you. Make sure you read the book, too!

I don't think there are much films who represent the genre better than this one. The story is original and horrifying, the make-up effects are flawless and very brutal, the characters get under your skin and the villains ( if I may call the Cenobites that ) will haunt your thoughts long after you finished watching this movie. Clive Barker is one of the most talented authors in the field of horror. He did a great job here in filming his own writings. He knows exactly where to put the stress, how to create the right atmosphere and when to attack the viewer with some great twists. Larry Cotton and his 2nd wife Julia move in to his parental house. It seems that Larry's brother, who was always a rather morbid person, has been there too but there's no sign of him. When Larry accidentally spills blood to the floor, something real strange happens. Because of the blood Frank, who was caught in the wooden floor, comes back to life. He escaped from hell and the torments of the Cenobites. Julia discovers Frank, who is still very weak. Because she always loved him and had an affair with him once, she promises to cure him completely. She brings home men for him, but it has to happen fast, cause it's only a matter of time before the Cenobites find him. It's Kirsty, Larry's daughter, who discovers this horrible secret. She steals the box and gets in contact with the Cenobites. As a sort of deal to escape hell, she gives her word that she'll take them to Frank...Like I said, this is pure horror. This is one of the rare films that makes you shiver and sweat. The character of PINHEAD, the lead Cenobite, grew out to one of the biggest icons in horror. In fact, he's the only who really deserves this status. He's pure evil, but ...fair. As strange as that may sound, he's bound to rules and he doesn't break them. You have to be in his world before he's a threat to you, but when you are there's no escape from his evil. When you may fire off quotes likeno tears, please. That's a waste of good suffering or we'll tear your soul apart you are EVIL, no discussion about that. HELLRAISER is praised everywhere. Even other big names in the genre declared this a masterpiece. Stephen King himself was very impressed as well. Clive Barker has done some other great works like NIGHTBREED and LORD OF ILLUSIONS. The also famous tale of CANDYMAN is from his hand as well. All recommendations if you liked this film, and it's hard to imagine that you didn't. Hellraiser was followed by many sequels. Hellraiser 2 is great as well and a logical continue of the story. All the rest are inferior, but still very entertaining if you're a big fan of Pinhead...like I am. "},{"Title":"Gothic, Gory, Romantic, Beautiful, Colorful, and Tasteful horror film. A Gem!","Date":"28 October 2007","Score":"47 out of 65 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Contrary to what one might conceive in their minds BEFORE watching this classic horror movie, it should be said that Clive Barker has delivered us a real gem of a horror story, packed with intensity, both emotionally, as well as physically. Hellraiser is about love, lust, pain, and pleasure. It's been called an otherworldly tale of pain and torture. It's been referred to as a grim, Gothic romance. Needless to say, it's gore following is much more in numbers than that of the Lord Of The Rings trilogy. Truly, this film is everything one see's it to be, from a romance, to a gore show, to a good ol' fashioned scare show. Either way, it's a fine film regardless. I might add, however, that it may come as a surprise upon first viewing. What is surprising, is the way it plays out very dramatic. Our characters are very down to earth, each with their own personal idiosyncrasies and inner demons, not to mention personal strengths. Each of them stands like a look at the different human desires, fears, joys, and sorrows. It plays out like a grim, Shakespeare play. A man and woman, Larry and Julia Cotton, moving into a home where memories dwell upon like haunting spirits. Larry is a charismatic optimistic gentleman, full of love and compassion for his wife, and his daughter, Kirsty. Julia is a human relic of baggage and fallen dreams, because she bears so many dark secrets, one of which is an affair with Frank, her husband's younger brother. Frank is alive, and replenishing himself after a rather nasty encounter with a Pandora's Box. Larry's blood, spilled over a hardwood floor, brings Frank back to life from an excruciating death, in one of the finest special effects sequences in cinematic history. Once Julia and Frank reunite, their love is more dangerous, and powerful than imagined. Together they conspire in the grand tradition of McBeth and Othello, to reign in pleasure once again. Enter Kirsty, Larry's daughter, and Frank's niece. A warm hearted, but determined soul who crosses paths with Julia and Frank before they can finish their diabolical plan. Kirsty eventually encounters the dark secret beheld Frank upon his death, a puzzle box. It brings pain, pleasure, and death. Creatures of darkness; the Cenobites, angels to some, demons to others, come to Kirsty when she accidentally calls upon their ghoulish powers. Once unleashed, they must take someone back, and Kirsty knows now, how Frank is back, and she intends to return him to his deathly justice, and save her family...The writing is just remarkable. Clive Barker has given us people, humans, planted in their own desires, and determinations, and he tears them apart with fear, pain, death, destruction, and total degradation. The Cotton family are the perfect example of purity, torn to shreds by hate, lust, and anguish, and he takes great glee in showing us all the gory details.The production is a real high! This is what the best type of films are made of. Real, gory, bloody human remains, connecting to each other in divine sequence, to create a 100% greedy man. The colors are plenty and gorgeous. The look of the blood, and the shine of the lights, and the way the actors are lit... It's just beautiful. The music of the film is brilliant. Composer Christopher Young chills the film, and drenches it with his dramatic variation of the main title, and the rest of the music contains harsh strings, brass horns, music box cues, and rhythmic cues that speed the pace up with action.Clive Barker is such a great writer and director, and filmmaker altogether. He has given us a great thriller that crosses the line between reality and fiction, in great taste and color, literally. It's no wonder twenty years later, the film stands on it's own, aside from it's sequels, and remains an ultimate horror classic to end them all...well some of them anyway. It's not the only horror film to portray itself intellectually, and it certainly has it's gore effect to an all time high. Still, it's quite a dashing and artful film, and always a treat to watch every time.

Well define  Scary  ? opening an electricity bill and finding that it exceeds your life savings causes my heart to miss a few beats but will anyone be making a horror film about someone getting a massive electricity bill ? I don't think so either and very few films have terrified me and the notable few that have scared me witless like THREADS , QUATERMASS AND THE PIT aren't strictly speaking horror movies . In fact the one thing that used to terrify was DOCTOR WHO and what's that ? A childrens TV show shown at tea time so let's not kid ourselves horror movies are scary!!!! SPOILERS !!!!What I absolutely love about HELLRAISER is that it's not really a horror film as such - It's a macabre love story with loads of subtext about how love and sex can destroy us and in many ways it can be viewed as an AIDS allegory ( 1 ) . Larry doesn't satisfy his wife in a sexual matter and it's this sexual inadequacy that leads to his death , Julia lusts after Frank which leads to her death , men who've just met Julia go back to her flat for some casual sex only to be murdered , while Frank lusts after Kirsty ( Who can blame him ? ) and it's this obsession that leads to his death at the hands of the Cenobites ah yes the Cenobites . A lot of people seem upset that the Cenobites aren't to the fore in this movie but it should be pointed out that they're the catalyst of the story not the focus . The story revolves around Frank and Julia's relationship and Julia's dissatisfaction with her marriage . In fact you could easily rewrite the story with Frank being on the run from a criminal gang instead of demons from another dimension and you'd still have the same story I will admit there are some flaws to the movie such as the bizarre dubbing but I should point out that this was done post production in order to make the characters more identifiable ( 2 ) to an American audience hence English characters speaking with Bronx accents which does make some of the performances laughable . Ironically the only performance which can be described as bad is genuine American Ashley Laurence as Kirsty , but hey she's gorgeous so let's not complain too much lads . Writer/director Clive Barker's strengths do outweigh any weakness , take for example the scene in the hospital where a nurse watches TV and it's not a TV show she's watching but a rose in bloom , and for me the greatest image isn't the murder and gore but the scene at the end where a photograph of Frank burns to a haunting soundtrack . Barker does get good performances out of most of the cast namely Andrew Robinson who isn't as good as he was in DIRTY HARRY but he'll never be able to top that and he is good as uber wimp Larry , Claire Higgins as femme fatale Julia and Sean Chapman as the human version of Frank. I thought Chapman might have gone on to become a big name after this movie but strangely not . Even stranger I thought Barker would have gone onto bigger and better things but for some reason I found myself disliking his other stuff and seems to have disappeared from film making all together and I can't say I'm all that upset HELLRAISER is a classic story on the themes of love and death . Such a pity someone wanted to turn the movie into a franchise ( 1 ) The same week HELLRAISER was released FATAL ATTRACTION topped the US box office charts . One can't help thinking HELLRAISER would have been better regarded if it came out a few weeks earlier since the subtext is very similar to the Michael Douglas blockbuster ( 2 ) HELLRAISER spent several weeks in the US box office reaching a peak of number three on the charts and taking millions of dollars ( Not bad for a movie costing one million bucks ) so the dubbing is probably justified  "},{"Title":"A nasty lil' auld box that'll give you pain or pleasure.","Date":"6 March 2004","Score":"36 out of 52 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Hellraiser (1987) is a dark masterpiece from the twisted world of Clive Barker.

Hellraiser's themes include sadomasochism, in an intriguing concept of the slasher figure in the story, which is a Gothic- looking antique puzzle box that summons ruthless demons to victimize the person in possession of it by subjecting them to a world of debilitating eternal pain. It also involves a femme fatale on the level of a chiller that does not involve fantasy, played brilliantly in an extremely acute performance by beautiful Clare Higgins. There is the layer of plot surrounding her that inhabits late-thirties, early-forties married and adulterous life with her almost frustratingly naive and unsuspecting husband, which is invaded by the devilish embodied soul of her ex-lover, brutalized by the demons of the puzzle box. Finally, at the core of the story is the pivotal character, as her fill of screen time patiently awaits to the point where she is revealed to be so, and she is the teenage stepdaughter, played by Ashley Laurence, one of the sexiest actresses I have ever seen. Everything from her voluptuous body to her scream-bloody-murder portrayal of the stepdaughter makes me wonder why her career never went any higher than this.So yes, the movie is more urbane than the vast majority of other horror films in that decade. It's even set in England. It's interesting that no one has an English accent in England, according to this movie, but nevertheless the locale serves the film with a dark atmosphere of sophistication and antiquity, which suits a story that surrounds an age-old puzzle box. This feel of the movie that I speak of is interrupted, quite inexplicably by beer-drinking, dirty-T-shirt-wearing American furniture movers, which I didn't know they had in England.Hellraiser is quite an enormous entertainment despite its 1980s-style inconsistencies that I suppose it just couldn't help but have.

All we have this time is a cube, that opens doors to hell and unleashes the bringers of pain; Pinhead and friends, who want to play with you forever.But even that story is being somewhat pushed to the background and it focuses more on a family, of which the wife falls madly for the the no good brother of her soon to be husband. The brother however messed with the cube and got stuck in Pinhead's hell of pain. He however managed to escape it but only in a skeleton form. He needs blood to slowly regain his body and asks the wife to kill for him. This is were most of the movie its 'horror' comes from. The movie doesn't get its horror aspects from its normal usual scare- or gross out moments. It's more a movie that works on its atmosphere and story development. Perhaps it's also due to the restrained budget, that simply forced the film-makers to be creative with the things they had at hand. The movie is no big Hollywood production and as a matter of fact it actually is an UK movie, that still got obviously aimed toward the American market as well though, in terms of its overall style.And even though the movie was low-budget, the movie certainly did not look that way. Also its effects such as its make-up and the effects used for the more gory parts of the movie are really great looking. The make-up of course helped to make Pinhead an horror icon-figure, though in this movie he isn't even called by the name Pinhead, which was only a name that got developed later for marketing purposes.The movie also features a great musical score by Christopher Young, that fits the movie really well.

Clive Barker is an outstanding writer. In terms of literary style light years ahead of Stephen King. His awesomely unhinged imagination is given free rein in this tale of the darker side of the human psyche. Frank Cotton (Sean Chapman) is as immoral and perverted a scumbag as you could hope to find in the English speaking world. Ever alert to the potential for some new thrill (sexual or otherwise) Frank comes by a small carved wooden cube that just happens to be (in the right hands) a gateway to Hell. Not your normal run of the mill pit of hot sulphur fumes presided over by a horned Lucifer wielding his time-honored pitchfork, but a most unpleasant parallel dimension, home of the wickedly inventive Pinhead and his cenobite cohorts. As the series worked its way onwards, Pinhead (Bradley) became a retro cult hero much like Freddy Kreuger and was given increased screen-time! Frank ends up paying the ultimate price in his search for new pleasures and to his everlasting discomfort, inevitably discovers the real meaning of the film's tag-line He'll tear your soul apart. This leaves Frank's ex well and truly home-alone and she takes up with his wimpy brother Larry, crawlingly played by Andrew Robinson.Things might have worked out for Julia (Higgins) and daughter Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) had not Larry cut his hand badly and the blood run beneath the floorboards where Frank's decimated but undead corpse responds dramatically well to the corpuscled cocktail! Frank's gory resurrection is actually one of the film's highlights, aided and abetted as it is by a superb musical score from Christopher Young! Frank of course is a little miffed over Julia's dalliance with his brother and persuades her to bring him an assembly line of fresh meat to ensure his complexion is brought up to scratch. The demise of the first victim especially is quite shocking horror and on its own would have earned the film its R certificate. Without giving anything else away, it is left to daughter Kirsty to combat both Frank, her socially distasteful step-mother and Pinhead. It is the ultimate learning curve you might say. One hell of a lot goes wrong before it starts getting any better. Frank's second whirl on the block is distinctly gruesome. Kirsty who under normal circumstances would be left a gibbering idiot, survives to take on the sequel and a further appearance by her awesomely repulsive stepmother! You want horror? you want originality? you like blood on tap? you need HELLRAISER! For all the above though, Barker's CANDYMAN was still better!

As I've said elsewhere, the movies I find to be worthwhile viewing experiences are those that receive reviews at both extreme ends of the spectrum. Movies like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind receive nearly 100% positive reviews and I find them to be sorely lacking in imagination and execution. Movies with uniformly poor reviews are generally very genuinely bad. Hellraiser, on the other hand, is a phenomenal accomplishment for a low-budget B-movie.Personally, I do not find this movie to be particularly gory. There are a few strong scenes, but the more unsettling parts of the movie involve no bloodshed at all. This includes Julia's betrayal of her soon-to-be husband.The trend in horror movies at the time that this was released was towards more realistic villains, usually the guy next door who was a little whacked. Hellraiser was prepared to introduce evil in a completely different form. Several reviewers have commented on how they have been confused about what exactly is happening in this movie. I find that puzzling, since the circumstances (and most of the Hellraiser mythos) is spelled out quite plainly in this first movie of the series.In general, the special effects are pretty cheesy, but the Cenobites are depicted very well. The images really stick in your mind. I have a replica of the LeMarchand puzzle box on my desk and I don't believe anyone has ever picked it up and asked me what it is. Everyone recognizes the box that calls Pinhead.The Anchor Bay release of this movie belongs in your collection.**** out of ***** "},{"Title":"Wildly overrated classic.","Date":"6 August 2001","Score":"24 out of 40 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  ** out of ****In my time, I've seen hundreds of horror films and I think I have a pretty good firm grasp of what films in the genre are truly great, which is why I have to say that Clive Barker's Hellraiser is among the most overrated.  It suffers from too many drawbacks in the story, as well as Barker's own direction, and never quite lives up to its ability to deliver consistent good scares.  The story of Hellraiser is fairly in simple in technical terms.  A man, Frank Cotton, purchases a configuration shaped as a box and fiddles around with it, opening a dimension that lies between the depths of pleasure and pain.  Years later, Frank's brother, Larry (Andrew Robinson), and his wife Julia (Claire Higgins) move into the same house.  Larry gets a deep cut on his hand and the blood spills to the ground, which actually revives Frank (in a rather gruesome sequence).  He and Julia shared a past together and he convinces her to bring men back to kill so he can use their blood to bring his flesh back.When it comes to some shocks and jolting moments of suspense, Hellraiser has some well-done scenes.  There are some scares in the film, and the gore effects, which are in a gratuitous abundance, are quite impressive.  There are a few moments of startlingly effective imagery and some very suspenseful scenes, but Clive Barker does so many other things wrong I can hardly believe this movie is actually considered a classic by so many people.This movie is essentially about pleasure and pain, or so I think Barker would try to lead us to believe that's what this is all about.  Those ideas are given a ham-fisted presentation in flashback torture scenes.  Yeah, I see all the pain, but where's all the enticement of pleasure? In the novella, Frank was tempted with the possibility of sex (but in the most repellant manner). The torture scenes are all Barker really cares to show us when it comes to these ideas, basically featuring some people get ripped apart by chains. I suppose I can't forget the fact that people also talk about it, too.  The character Frank goes into these frank and quite dumb brief conversations about how he was bored and simply wanted to experience more and go to the limits, his words not mine.  I'm sorry, but this hardly sounds like a decent reason to do anything like this.  If he was close to death or something along those lines, I could almost believe it, but I could only scoff when he uttered those lines.When it comes to horror films, logical lapses can be accepted.  It's a lot easier to take such moments in fun-based horror films that are simply meant for escapism, but this movie's pretentiousness is overbearing.  Thus, it's a little hard to believe that nobody in the house could smell the rotting, maggot-infested corpses of three men.  It's also a little hard to accept the fact that Robinson's character never realizes just how repressed his wife is.  Sure, he notices she's got problems, but she's a murderous psycopathic bitch.  Barker gives the movie a dark and grim look, not necessarily a bad choice, but he likes to conjure up a lot of dark themes and taboos for the sake of just trying to make the movie look...well, different, dark, and offbeat.  The movie focuses on extramarital affairs, serial killings, and even incest and does all this just by simply tossing these odd moments on-screen without any care or background for it in the first place.  These characters' motivations for such odd behavior is never explained and they're simply way too evil to be taken as real people.The cenobites are only sparingly used in the movie, probably a good idea on Barker's behalf.  They're a little scary at first, but I felt a little goofy after awhile when I realized I was getting scared by a creature that likes to look straight in the air and speak in a dull monotone.  Yeah, I'm talking about Pinhead, the famed horror villain of the series.  Played by Doug Bradley, he's a little enigmatic at first but after a few moments, you really don't care what he is.  In the film, the cenobites appear to have the ability to transport around as is seen when they suddenly appear at the Cotton residence.  (Spoiler)  Yet, when they try to take Kirsty with them, they move towards her at a slug's pace and she simply uses the box to transport them back (speaking of which, I'm clearly certain the fat cenobite only fell through the floor).  That doesn't sound like the all-powerful demons we were prior shown.  Oh, and by the way, this visual lightshow in the finale is pretty embarrassing.    Ashley Laurence is the main character of this film, as well its first sequel.  She's a little wooden here at times, but is relatively okay.  Andrew Robinson is also not bad as the unwitting husband, but claire Higgins is absolutely horrendous.  Trying to act like a repressed woman turned murderous fiend, she just comes off with a terrible impression.  As for the rest of this franchise, I've only seen Hellbound, which is worse than this.  I sure do sound like I'm bashing Hellraiser, but as I said before, it does have its scares and jolting moments.  The only reason I give it as much a harsh criticism as it seems like I am is because of its beloved acclaim from horror fans everywhere, which it really doesn't deserve.

People write on & on what great horror icons the Cenobites are, & yes this is true, they have made a huge impact to cinema horror, but the Cenobites are not what this truly intelligent horror film is about...no, not at all! This is a film about Frank & Julia. Frank will stop at nothing to find the next thrill, even if it means his physical & metaphysical destruction. Julia is the cool aloof wife of Larry, Frank's brother. Julia is seduced by Frank's dark & sadistic sexual aura, though that same aura lay dormant in Julia until Frank awakened it by seducing Julia before her wedding to Larry. I'll do anything, Julia desperately confesses to Frank to keep his affection. Little does Julia dream that in the future that will be exactly what she has to do to keep Frank, after he unleashes the Box, & its horror, the Cenobites. In what is truly an Oscar worthy performance, Julia (Claire Higgins) the aloof, but so far non-threatening wife transforms into the murderous, cold, calculating queen bitch, to resurrect & have Frank. To bad we've not seen more of her in other films.Yes, Hellraiser is about treachery in the family, the worse sort, deception & murder. Hellraiser is about blind love.(Spoilers) Larry's unswerving devotion to Julia, which makes him the last to know, & seals his doom. Hellraiser is about the tragic plight of Kristy trying to save her father. What could be worse than knowing a loved one is going to be murdered & you could not stop it? Hellraiser is about real life plausible situations that are better off left alone, the darkest part of the human psyche, to want something so bad you're will to sacrifice anything & anyone to achieve it, maybe even your self. Hellraiser aptly uses the theme of don't tempt fate (the Box), unless your prepared to be taken by it, as the Cenobites so profoundly demonstrates.So yes, the true monster of this story is ambition & want. The Cenobites are just a cataclysmic vehicle (a very disturbing one) to carry Julia & Frank to their just deserts in the end. Hellraiser made the Cenobites seem like ultimate bogeymen by giving them little screen time & keeping them mysteriously cryptic to the audience, something later films could've benefited from. Thus Pinhead & crew were much more menacing & potent in this first, & by far the best, most intelligent film of the series, & in horror cinema.... But again, it was Julia & Frank, & their ambition & want that were the true terrors here. Nothing is more disturbing & horrific than discovering someone(s) you love & trust will eventually murder you.Chilling!

Frank Cotton (Sean Chapman) in some unspecified location buys a Chinese puzzle box from a mysterious man, who is always shown in shadow. The film then jumps to the attic in Franks house, somewhere in London. Sitting on the bare wooden floorboards surrounded by candles, he solves the puzzle of the box. Demons from hell known as Cenobites appear Pinhead (Doug Bradley), Chatterer (Nicholas Vince), Butterball (Simon Bamford), and a female Cenobite (Grace Kirby). Using hooks on chains they tear Frank to pieces, in pretty graphic detail. Franks brother Larry (Andrew Robinson) and his wife Julia (Clare Higgins) decide to move into the house. While moving in Larry slices his hand on an old nail sticking out of the stair case. He set off to find Julia who is in the attic reminiscing about the affair she had with Frank. Larry stumbles into the attic and drips blood all over the floor. This blood rejuvenates Frank, another impressively gruesome scene showing his body recreating itself, fingers forming, ribs attaching themselves, his brain being made and attached, you get the idea. He however is not fully formed and needs fresh human blood to make himself whole again. Julia discovers him in the attic and after some persuasion by Frank she agrees to help him, to bring him victims. things get even more complicated when Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) Larrys daughter gets involved, and the Cenobites return to take Frank back to hell.Written, based on his novel The Hellbound Heart, and directed by Clive Barker I think this is a very gruesome, gory, blood splattered film, but the characters and story are not sacrificed and together combine to create a truly original, startling and extremely effective low budget horror film that spawned various sequels. The effects handled by Bob Keen and his crew are extremely impressive for such a low budget film, sections of someones face laid out on the floor like a jig-saw puzzle, hooks ripping skin to shreds, skinless corpses, Franks various states of decay and re-animation, and the Cenobites themselves are well conceived and realized. One effect I found poor however was the monster who chases Kirsty when she opens a door to hell in her hospital room. Still, a very good job all round. The acting was fine. The script, written by Barker based upon one of his novels was good, it kept things moving along nicely and it stays away from any wise cracking one liner bad guys, popular in horror films at the time. He obviously wanted to make a very serious horror film, and succeeds admirably. Technically everything else is fine, photography, music, production design and editing. On the down side I thought the ending looked a bit rushed, 90% of the film is set in the same house which gets a bit dull after a while, a few things aren't really explained satisfactorily, like the creepy tramp who follows Kirsty around, but these are minor quibbles. A very impressive film, for those with the stomach, I really liked it and recommend it. "},{"Title":"One of a kind horror film by Clive Barker","Date":"15 January 2013","Score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Horror novelist Clive Barker is known for making some outrageously gross stories. And after two unsuccessful short films, Barker decided to direct his first theatrical film. Little did he know that it would not only be his most memorable film to date, but it would also become very popular. However, what amazes me is just how effective each component of the whole movie is. It is truly one of the great masterpieces in the horror genre of its time.Hellraiser (1987) is a film adaptation of Clive Barker's self-written novel, The Hellbound Heart. The story is about a remarried man, Larry (Andrew Robinson) and his daughter, Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) being caught in a web of terror. Larry's new woman, Julia (Clare Higgins), happens to be a secret lover of her husband's brother, Frank (Sean Chapman). Frank is a sexually deprived man who bought a mystical puzzle box called the Lament Configuration. When this puzzle is solved, it opens a dimensional portal to hell, where a group of terrifying individuals called the Cenobites, literally tear Frank's soul apart, limb from limb, layer by layer.To start off, all the actors do a great job portraying their characters. Robinson makes himself seem like the most humble farther a child could ask for. Higgins and Chapman show good chemistry on screen as well. Slowly over the running time, viewers will see the transition that takes over Higgins' character, as she goes from lonely, to shocked, to lustful. On the other hand, Sean Chapman as Frank gives a very good performance as the battered soul that he is. He too carries great lust for Julia and shows how desperate he is to have her again. It is amazing that Julia would even want to join him again!By far though, the character with the most guts in this whole film is Kirsty Cotton played by Ashley Laurence. For all the horror films that have been released, it is rare that audiences come across a strong female protagonist. For Laurence's first starring role, there's a lot of credit to be given to her for conveying her character so well. Not to mention the fact that Laurence is very attractive in this picture. And she's not a scream queen all the time either. Her brazenness by far surpasses many other female characters in other horror franchises. I did find her boyfriend to be rather unnecessary though. He didn't do anything the whole time during the film. He was always a step behind everyone else, so why bother even have him in the movie?What was definitely effective here were the atmosphere; credited to the music and the special effects used throughout the film which created hair-raising, skin crawling imagery. The musical score provided by composer Christopher Young did an outstanding job. Not only was his score creepy and engrossing but it also created a sense of tragedy. The tragedy was cued by the constant waltz time each tune had. Adding to that is Young's constant theme that the audience is reminded of when the camera is focused on the Frank and Julia. A memorable tune indeed.Lastly, the special effects is one the components prominently noted in Clive Barker's Hellraiser franchise. There is some stop motion animation but the real movie magic lies in the make-up department headed by Geoffrey Portass. Everything from the gore, to the Frank's resurrection, to the Cenobite make-up themselves is executed terrifically. The Lead Cenobite played by Doug Bradley is done so well, many people would say he was born for that role, which I agree. I also liked the look of the other cenobites; The Female, The Chatterer and Butterball. I would've preferred though if The Lead Cenobite introduced them in the film. Some newcomers may be confused to what their names are.Along with these characters are some of the most disturbing imagery used throughout any film. Some of it really is just bloodcurdling. Tearing skin off a human body may not be some people's cup of tea. There was also another scene that I found quite eerie but it was never explained to what it meant. This scene involves Kirsty with a background noise of a baby crying. It definitely made me feel uncomfortable, which was good, but I wanted to understand the significance of it and it never was explained. Along with that flaw was Kirsty's useless boyfriend which leaves me liking the rest of this movie a lot.Clive Barker's first film is a classic that should not be passed up. The actors, special effects and music work together to create a tragic cohesive story that is a fresh look at the horror genre.

Unlike many genre offerings from that decade this one is not formulaic at all. It's chiefly for this reason that Hellraiser is respected. Barker proved himself to be something of a talent and one who would end up directing very little else unfortunately.Hellraiser is a story about the occult but like no other film of that sub-genre. Instead of the typical demonic creatures you would see in many other films of this type, this one introduces the Cenobites. These denizens of hell are a good deal more memorable, and have a somewhat S&M styling that gives them added deviancy. They look highly original. Throughout the film there are a series of visually spectacular set-pieces. The look and atmosphere of Hellraiser belies is very modest budget. Barker and his team consistently make the most of their meagre resources and it's never obvious that this is so low-budget.The celebrated fantasy moments are well off-set by a story of a dysfunctional family. The characters are all well rounded and believable which again is not a typical aspect of an 80's horror movie. The performances are universally strong, including an atypically good guy role for Andrew Robinson who was most famous for playing the psychopath Scorpio in Dirty Harry.All in all, a quality production.

The Cenobites are outstanding. They completely steal the show. Pinhead (played by Doug Bradley, a name that would become synonymous with Hellraiser), Female, Chatterer, and Butterball are awesome in all their gory S&M glory. Someone once said that if you assembled all of the horror icons at a dinner table, Pinhead would be the only one using silverware. After watching this movie again, that seems to be a very true statement. Aside from the Cenobites, Frank is an extraordinary sight to behold. Bob Keen's effects team has outdone themselves. The entire world that Barker has created astounds me. He's really pushing the envelope here. The dark imagery and the concept of the Lament Configuration are incredible. Why aren't more original movies made? Today they all seem to rip off the same concepts. Hellraiser is a completely original eerie experience. It's one of the few films I can think of that was unique and has stayed unique after all these years. There are a lot of opinions about the sequels. Mine is stop after Hellraiser II as II is the end of the truly dark nature that these films have (although III is certainly a guilty pleasure).

I actually saw this movie when I was about 10 years old and can't believe how well the film has held up after all these years. Some of the movie hasn't aged as well though as in the ending.Julia is business woman who had a torrid affair with her husband Larry's brother Frank, a dark and mysterious world traveler. When Frank dies under suspicious and supernatural circumstances Julia and Larry move into his house (naturally). Larry also has a daughter, Kirsty, from his first marriage who now lives on her own. While helping the movers Larry accidentally cuts open is hand on a nail and goes looking for Julia. He finds her in the attic where Frank died. Larry's wound bleeds on the floor, which intern starts in motion the resurrection of Frank.A while back Frank had bough a puzzle box from a street vendor. Its like a Rubik's Cube, but if you solve it opens up a doorway to hell. The box summons the sadomasochistic demons known as the Cenobites, whose only pleasure is your pain. With Larry's blood Frank is able to escape the Cenobites and tries to reclaim human form. The effects used in Frank's slow regeneration are pretty awesome. He is completely skinless and looks like he'd make a good Body Worlds Exhibit. He needs human victims to able to continue the regeneration process and with Julia wanting her dead lover back helps him. She lures a handful of unsuspecting business men to their death. So where is Larry in all this? Completely oblivious and unaware that anything is wrong, so basically a typical 80s movie husband. Kirsty does get suspicious when she sees her step mom with another man. While at the house looking for her dad, she discovers the new frank and is able to steal the puzzle box. Frank ups his search for some skin and sort of reunites with his brother Larry.

His 1987 film, Hellraiser is a really good example of how a late 80's horror film can work.Nearing the 90's, horror films started to go down hill. In 1991 and 1996, we got two really good thriller horrors, being SCREAM and Silence of the Lambs. This film however, was the last of it's kind to give us some good late 80's slasher craze which was still born and still very fresh with horror freaks.I won't go into the plot because I believe everyone should have seen Hellraiser by now, if not, well GO SEE IT! All I can say is that the concepts of the box is terrific. A new way to kill a slashing demon is always a terrific and creative concept and it works really well in this one. I also love the soundtrack suite which is haunting beautiful and dramatic in parts. The actors are superb and their characters are believable.Doug Bradley as Pinhead is the best and he knows how to give us a creepy killer which cannot be stopped. I dunno why in Revelations they got a different actor to play him. Doug is Pinhead, end of story.I also like the way the death scenes and plot are shown. The director takes it a little step at a time while as most directors just go full on with the violence and exploit everything. Clive actually took his time to tell the story and that's what made most of the ending sequences and starting deaths so intense. It all left us to the core suspense.Also, the 1987 film is the only Hellraiser film I have really liked. I've also seen part 3, 4 and 6. 3 was OK, 4 was dodgy and 6 sucked. The thing about the first film was that it had a dramatic fantasy to it, while being realistic, people were dying for real. The other Hellraiser films I have seen since then haven't really had the same impact but instead really try to rehash and be as shocking, doesn't work at all!?My verdict on this 87 classic is a 7.5/10.P.S I just hope they can get this right in the remake next year.

A brilliant and breathtaking Horror classic","Date":"12 July 2011","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" I have been a lover of horror series' for a very long time. I love them, no matter how bad or good, the B-Movie the better. I guess I just love the whole returning 'evil' being, and the good guys that stop especially if its a re-occurring good guy (Donald Pleasance in Halloween for instance.) So I decided it was time to check out the Hellraiser series and I intend on watching all of them (currently there are nine.) I know I had seen the original two or three before but it has been a long time. What I forgot was that Clive Barker created a stone cold classic with the original Hellraiser. Incredibly gory, creepy, brilliant special effects without the guise of modern CGI. Brilliant beasts, and truly stunning cinematography. Its easy to see why this was a stepping stone for milking this series to straight to video. The killers are kept truly mysterious in this instalment and are definitely memorable in every way. A story about lust, infidelity and pain and pleasure is the core to Hellraiser and the squeamish should stay away because Hellraiser holds no punches! Newcomer Ashley Laurence is the young scream queen of Hellraiser. For a first time in a big screen production she is absolutely perfect. She embodies everything that a main female scream queen should and is easily right up there with Jamie Lee Curtis from Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street's Heather Langenkamp. Long time character actor Andrew Robinson plays Laurence's father and new homeowner and husband Larry. He is straight laced, and almost dull (but this is the way his character is played.) He is essentially perfect in the role. Clare Higgins role is downright memorable as the unfaithful, and twisted wife and stepmother Julia. Higgins' performance can best be described as a truly terrific soap opera villain. She over plays it, and she adds the true B-Movie quality to the film but at the same time is the perfect nemesis to innocent Kirsty. Also basically new to the big screen is Doug Bradley who becomes and embodies the lead cennobite (the name of the beings from Hell). Of course we all know him as Pinhead although never referred by that name in the film. Bradley plays a dark mysterious, somehow seemingly regal leader. He commands respect on screen in his character which is a completely new element to the 'slasher' genre. Oliver Smith is the creature that escapes from the cennobites to come back to life. He does a great job under all that make up playing the disturbed and tortured Frank.This was a first for a lot of things and that includes Horror legend Clive Barker's first time writing and directing. No one knows Barker's twisted mind better than Barker. He obviously translates what his stories tell flawlessly to the big screen and its unfortunate he doesn't do more directing because this is brilliant. The world he creates is what Hellraiser is all about. It isn't even about the characters or the story but this dark and terrifying world that emerges from this mysterious box. Hellraiser is a horror staple and when you stop to look at the incredible work done on make up and special effects you'll see this was true brilliance in special effects and horror.

But no, Hellraiser remains a true classic of the horror genre and is just as I remembered it. I can't agree with those who describe the acting as mediocre.  I found Andrew Robinson, Clare Higgins and Ashley Laurence to be quite natural in their portrayals (Robinson does ham it up a bit towards the end but even that's perfectly in character for who he's playing and at that point in the story). Some would complain about the characters being unpleasant but I think adults deserve some entertainment of their own without Leave it to Beaver representations of life.  The unpleasantness of Frank and Julia is in keeping with the EC Comics traditional horror feel to the story. The special effects sequences (particularly the resurrection of Frank) were still just as impressive.  If you have any passion for horror films I think there's something here for you, whether you're into the arthouse, gore or traditional horror storytelling approach or if you're looking for something unique or different. This is a dark and sombre film and there is a lot of gory effects and some surreal moments.  Clive Barker's direction and the hammer murders owes some debt to Pete Walker's 70s horror movies but much of the film is truly his alone.  The cenobites and the way corpses are resurrected are unique and innovative.  Christopher Young's musical score is an integral part of the film's grim baroque mood.

The best example of this is the atmosphere which drips off here quite thickly, and it sucks you in as its present throughout the whole movie. From the simple like the lighting to the location of the sets to the general mood of the film, as well as the gradual realization of the horror to come in her adultery and the connection with the box itself, this one is incredibly suspenseful. That really sells the movie here with the film really offering plenty of solid moments to not only underscore the relationship but the mystery surrounding the box which really drives the film and the ever-widening part of it's legacy makes this quite a chilling tale when it's all put together with the brother's escape and his being chased. Even more comes from the regeneration scenes, as he comes back from a pool of blood in one part as basically bones with a little bit of skin and takes so long to come to form that it becomes even bloodier. From what the regeneration starts as and where it ends is a great highlight to a great scene. Even all the bloody corpses seen in here are pretty disgusting, being mangled and distorted beyond belief. That brings up the gore in here, and this film is incredibly gory so something like a simple cut on the hand is more like an opening to a geyser. The deaths are just as good and include some pretty brutal moments, specifically the ever-popular dismemberment by chained-hooks scene which is one of its more iconic images. Of course, one can't talk about this film without mentioning the Cenobites, which are introduced in here and are one of the best horror creations of all time. Demonic looking in nature, each one has a distinct look and personality that evokes particularly demonic and scary images yet are still portrayed as being cool and somewhat fashionable with Pinhead in particular getting the chance to spout off some legendary lines. The rest of the creatures are legendary and memorable for good reason, being the heart and soul of this movie. About the only thing really wrong here is the rather convoluted plot-line that takes a while to get all out of the plot, but it's still a little all over the place. It seems to tell three different stories and never really gives it much time to develop leaving this with some confusing moments, but otherwise there wasn't much wrong with this one.Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity and several sex scenes.

Here we have Frank, who has sought out all forms of pleasure, so much so that he is willing to venture into the world of the Cennobites. The Cennobites come from a reality where pleasure and pain are one and the same, and offer to show mortals who open their puzzle box the experience of ultimate pain through torture. Frank of course is human, and realizes too late that he cannot enjoy pain in the same way as the demons can, and is set on a path to try to escape from the Hell he has created. Clive Baker has always been one to condemn the consumer driven culture, and here we have the ultimate example of a hedonistic life style turned morality play. Frank gives in to the pleasure the box offers, his lover betrays her husband and gives into Frank, murdering men have a chance at another love affair. Pinhead gave up his humanity when he bored of torturing Jews and turned to the box, and each Cennobite is a reflection of their sin in mortal life. All in all this film is well shot, and the special effects bring found memories to an era where film makers had to put some creativity and work into their craft instead of the CGI craze we have now. The same way vinyl records have a warm charm to them, is the same way I look fondly on the splatter movies of the 80's, and the artists who contributed to the gore that fueled the nightmares of a generation. I see on Clives wiki that there may be a Hellraiser remake, hopefully there is not as every horror remake of the 80's classics have been very far departures from their forefathers.

Anyone who watches a lot of horror films knows that the 80's horror scene was dominated by the slasher genre and while some of those turned out to be quite good, after a while they just became the same old thing. Luckily, there were a few breaks in between the slasher madness, be it good vampire/ werewolf flicks (like Lost Boys/The Howling) or tales of such high strangeness, that they became automatic classics in their own right. Hellraiser was one of those. Released by New World Pictures in 1987, it was directed by a young writer by the name of Clive Barker who, although having little in the way of filmmaking experience, managed to make one of the most bizarre, unique, and imaginative films of any kind ever! It all begins when Frank, a degenerate looking for the next immoral thrill, buys a strange cube shaped puzzle box from a mysterious man somewhere in the Middle East. From there, it's all down hill as Frank solves the box and gets sucked into the strange sadomasochistic hell of the cenobites, beings who, in the famous words of their leader Pinhead, are explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some, Angels to others. But it doesn't end there, as Frank's brother, Larry, and his wife, Julia, soon move into the old family home where Frank is brought back through Larry's blood being spilt from an accident as some sort of horrific zombie/skeleton hybrid. Julia, in a bid to help her former lover (yes, she and Frank had an affair) agrees to help make Frank whole again by bringing him hapless men to suck dry and as a result, makes Julia more and more cold blooded. But they have to hurry because the cenobites don't like being duped! The plot alone should be praised for its originality and boldness, weaving together a story that incorporates the idea of pain as pleasure, horror, eroticism, extreme gore, and strangeness, all in the same movie! Clive Barker proved his worthiness to be included in the hall of horror masters by adapting his novella, The Hellbound Heart to the big screen through the use of well done cinematography, lighting and camera direction (it's all even more remarkable when one remembers that other than directing a few short films, Barker had almost no experience in the director's chair).Credit also must go to the makeup and special effects guys for bringing to life some of the most bizarre creatures ever, be it Frank the monster or the dreaded cenobites themselves, with their tight leather clothes, skin-crawling self mutilations/deformations and bad ass leader, Pinhead himself or lead cenobite as he's known here. In another actor's hands, Pinhead might have just been a cool looking monster and not much else. But in the hands of Doug Bradley, he's given a personality and charisma, thus making him one of the most memorable monsters ever. All the actors do a fine job here, be it Andrew Robinson as Larry; Clare Higgins as Julia, the wife from hell; and Ashley Laurence in her introductory role of Kirsty, Larry's daughter who desperately tries to save her father after realizing the horrible truth. And of course, what good horror movie is without an effective music score and we sure get here in the form of Christopher Young's beautiful and foreboding score. To sum it up, if you're tired of seeing the same old thing in horror movies and are in the mood for something different, take a look at this and while you're at it, be very leery of any shady characters who try to sell you a puzzle box because you just never know what you're going to find inside!

I found it to be a very disgusting, ugly, eye-poppingly awesome but still grisly tale. But more recently, something told me to give the film another glance. And this was after I read the novel it was based on called HELLBOUND HEART. Upon seeing it again, I've gained a better perspective on the film. I believe part of what turned me off years ago were the extremely adult themes going on. Clive Barker, both the writer of the novel and the director of this one, knows his stuff and is not afraid to show it. So the gruesome story is A reprehensible man named Frank has spent his life living for pleasure and manages to track down a legendary puzzle box, like Pandora's. By solving the puzzle, he opens a netherworld and unleashes a group of demons called the Cenobites. Who introduce him to a world beyond pleasure and pain. Some time later, Frank's brother Larry (played by the wonderfully loopy Andrew Robinson) moves into the old family house along with his frigid second wife Julia. As it turns out, Frank and Julia had an affair years ago. After Larry suffers a minor accident, his spilled blood manages to revive Frank in one of the most impressive special effects scenes. Frank, at first a weak gelatinous skeleton, convinces Julia to get him more blood. So her solution is to lure men back to the house with the promise of sex, only to butcher them mercilessly with a hammer. Of particular note, I still find the murder of the first victim very chilling. And maybe that is what's so disgusting and unsettling about it. Unlike most horror films, the death scenes have very little, if any, music accompanying them. And the gore is not there for titillation, but rather to show how brutal and ugly death can be. As you might imagine not all goes as planned for Frank and Julia (who seems to be emerging as Lady Macbeth.) Larry's daughter Kirsty witnesses one of the murders and manages to steal the box. And yes, she opens it which causes the Cenobites to arrive! From that point forward, I'll leave the rest up to you, gentle blood-thirsty viewer! From start to finish, Clive Barker shows that he is a capable director and story teller. Granted, his work isn't for everyone and most are VERY adult-themed. But for those who feel brave enough to tackle his work, here is a good jumping-off point. For anyone who wants the fear of Hell put into them, make this required viewing at once!

And Clive Barker to me represents the height of horror along with Stephen King and the undisputed master of the horror tale H.P.Lovecraft. Clive Barkers films have a freshness to them and are unlike anything I've seen before.I have also seen Candyman, Nightbreed, Lord of Illusions, Book Of Blood and the Midnight Meat Train, all of which are outstanding.But his true masterpiece is undoubtedly Hellraiser which spawned a long number of sequel films to it. The film is adapted from a story of his the Hellbound Heart.It is a story about Frank (played by Sean Chapman), a nihilist and selfish moral degenerate who has participated in every hedonistic pleasure, extreme experience and sexual perversion known to man, each time seeking a greater pleasure higher than the last. Jaded, Frank hears rumor of a mysterious puzzle box (Lemarchand's Configuration) which opens the gateway to a realm of unfathomable carnal pleasures. Frank tracks down the current owner of the box in Dusseldorf and obtains it through performing small favors. Frank manages to solve the puzzle while squatting in the attic of his grandparents' house, where he has set up an elaborate display of flowers and a jug of his own urine. A gateway opens and appearing from it are the Cenobites, a race of distorted creatures who practice an extreme form of sadomasochism centered around agonizing torture and mutilation. They see little difference between extreme pleasure and extreme pain and drag Frank, willingly at first, into their extra-dimensional realm, where Frank begins what he realizes too late will be an eternity of torture.Frank's brother, Larry (played by Andrew Robinson), moves his family into the house inherited by him and Frank after their grandparents' death. Larry is married to Julia (played by Clare Higgins), who had a secret affair with Frank a week before her wedding and has ever since lusted for him while staying married to Larry for the financial support he provides. Due to an accident, several drops of Larry's blood land on the spot where Frank had ejaculated prior to being snatched into the Cenobites' realm. This allows Frank to contact the physical world, at first only as a whisper, then as an emaciated corpse. Julia, hoping to rekindle their affair, promises to help him.While Larry is at work, Julia begins picking up men whom she lures into the attic and sacrifices them to Frank, whose body becomes more substantial and whose consciousness more stable with every sacrifice. Kirsty (played by Ashley Laurence), Larry's niece, suspects that Julia is having a series of affairs and begins to trail her. After sneaking into the house, Kirsty has an altercation with Frank and ends up stealing his puzzle box, knowing only that Frank has some form of extreme attachment to it. After the fight, she collapses on the street. Upon awakening in hospital, she solves the puzzle box and the Cenobites come. She makes a deal with them, offering to deliver Frank back into their control to spare her. The Cenobites reluctantly accept. Their leader, a creature called Pinhead warning her that if she tricked them, they would tear her soul apart.Kirsty leads the Cenobites to Frank, now wearing recently slain Larry's skin. Another altercation ensues, in which Julia is killed by Frank. The Cenobites wait until Frank reveals his true identity, then re-capture him and return with him to their own realm.The box is now open and Kirsty must find a way to close it before it is too late.Outstanding direction and script by Clive Barker. Thrilling music by legendary Christopher Young. Superb Cinematography Robin Vidgeon and creature effects by veteran special effects man Bob Keen. There are 3 more films to see after watching Hellraiser. They are in order Hellbound Hellraiser 2, Hellraiser 3, and Hellraiser 4 Bloodlines in which Pinhead is destroyed once and for all.There are 4 more sequels after the fourth installment but they are not as good as the original first four films,but are worth watching and owning if you want a complete collection. They are in order Hellraiser Inferno, Hellraiser Hellseeker, Hellraiser Deader, Hellraiser Hellworld. Overall I give Hellraiser 10/10 for ORIGINALITY.

A movie about lust, desire, deceit, pleasures, and pain. All rolled into a puzzle box, which opens a doorway to your most inner desire or frightening nightmares. On one end, is Julie, a bored housewife who had a premarital interlude with her grooms brother frank. And frank, who is not satisfied with a simple sin, instead solves the puzzle box which transports him to the Cenobites dimension. But through this, Kirsty the daughter of Julie's husband begins to see mounting signs that something is wrong, out of place and intends to find the answer. And in doing so, makes a deal with the Cenobites to let her go if she leads them to frank who escaped from their grasp. But as all deals go, not everyone keeps their end of the bargain. As with Pinhead and his little entourage of minions, they try to take Kirsti with them but her quick fingers and fast movements help close the doorway using the box. This was a fascinating film using all manners of emotions, evil or not. But to see the most famous Cenobite who used to be a British officer turn Pinhead, is always glorious. His tone of soothsaying his guests run chills down anyone's spine. A favourite of evil beings in the world of horror. Making this section of genre the most successful movies to date including sequels.

The film is as beautiful as it is ugly, as hideous as it is intriguing, and without a doubt, will crawl under the skin of even the most desensitized genre fan. It's a film that is as much about the ugliness of death as it is about human nature and the evil that lurks within each and every one of us.In the film, Larry (Andrew Robinson) moves into a new house with his new wife, Julia (Clare Higgins), and daughter from a previous marriage, Kirsty (Ashley Laurence), without knowing that the soul of his seedy brother, Frank (Sean Chapman), is trapped within the house after solving a mysterious puzzle box. Once he gets a taste of the red stuff, Frank starts to take shape again, resuming his affair with his brother's wife and unwittingly opening the doors to Hell in the meantime while simultaneously introducing a gaggle of bizarre creatures known only as the Cenobites. The Cenobites are led by Doug Bradley as Pinhead, who, despite not being given a name until the sequel, cemented himself as a horror icon along with the Freddys and Jasons of the time and gets perhaps the best lines of the entire film. Clive Barker is truly a Master of Horror in his own right, and Hellraiser is a brilliant testament to that fact. Not only are the special effects grisly and, well, gross, but still manage to hold up even today, 23 years later. The film is grounded in solid performances by its cast, and especially in the case of Clare Higgins, are more than one-dimensional horror flick fodder. All of this is achieved, of course, with stunning visuals (gore aside) and a foreboding and cruel tone that just can't be beat. Even after all these years and seven sequels ranging from entertaining to mediocre, its impact has yet to be lessened. Hellraiser is easily one of the best horror movies of the 1980's, but also of all-time.

What would such a movie be about? That's what I asked myself when I was a kid. So I taped the movie on a VCR (my parents didn't know what they got at this time) and watched it alone and in the dark - and that's how it's supposed to be watched! Sure, if you see this with modern eyes, you may recognize some cheap effects, but hey, watch it, look over the cheap effects and you'll be happy you tuned into this! I must say, that in the 80's, you got a lot of horror flicks, like Friday 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street and so on. But this movie really got me. The story is the main point. It's not about a bunch of teenagers, who got to the wrong address. It's more about human relations and things we dream about (nightmares obviously included). The acting is o.k. If you watch this, you want to know how it ends (so did I) and if you like Clive Barker and his stories, you want to see it anyway. And, relating to the first four(!) movies, it's not repeating itself. I don't want to give any spoilers in this review, but this movie scared the hell out of me. Imagine you got a puzzle in your hands that can open the gates to heaven or hell - you don't know which - and you are able to solve it and it turns out to be, well, hell. What would you do? That's basically all this movie is about, but there is so much more... I must say for myself, that I can agree with all characters in this movie. I like all of them, they're build up like real persons, including the guy in the attic (you will see), who get's the box in the first place. So, if you want to see a real good horror flick with a story, that blows your mind - go for it. If you want to see some gore - go for it, too. If you are scared easily and don't want to see any horror movies at all - go home, lock your doors and hope, that Pinhead (sorry, in the first movie it's lead cenobite) isn't hiding below your bed!P.S. If there was any idea about the movie Hellraiser vs. Helloween - Pinhead would win!!!!

Usually you had a memorable villain (think Leatherface or Freddy) slaughtering a bunch of nubile teens in tried and tested fashion. Genre defining though they were, these movies always followed the same well-worn modus operandi at their most basic level they were simple body count films. But one stood out from the pack Hellraiser.Based on the Clive Barker novella The Hellbound Heart, Hellraiser eschews the old stalk and slash routine in favor of something more cerebral. Even if it's just as gory and violent as the aforementioned films, Hellraiser has that very rare thing unseen in movies of this type intelligence. This is as far from a Friday the 13th re-run as you can get. The movie is extremely well crafted with intricate characters that have complex arcs all set against an interesting story. Clive Barker directs with a lot of panache and evident technique, and the film has an almost surreal art house quality about it. Barker clearly knows what he's doing. Compare how this was shot with other horror movies made at the same time and you will see noticeable differences. The movie has a lot of style and substance thrown in with some genuinely distressing visuals.It also has a very imaginative story line. Frank, a man with a rather dubious past, solves a mysterious puzzle box and is rewarded with a trip to hell where he's mutilated for entertainment purposes by three demonic beings called 'Cenobites'. However, after being resuscitated by his brother's blood, he uses his love starved sister-in-law Julia &#x96; who he had a past affair with &#x96; as bait so that she can lure horny men back to their house so that he can feed on their blood and become a human again. The only problem is the hellish Cenobites come looking for him and all hell ensues. Clad in leather the Cenobites themselves resemble mutated entities from The Matrix (and remember this was twelve years before that movie was even made) and just like that movie, this one also has a similar fetishist quality about it.Andrew Robinson, who plays Frank's brother Larry, has certainly done his share of menacing characters in his time (The Scorpio Killer in Dirty Harry for example). But he does a complete about turn here and is the very epitome of decency &#x96; surely the hallmark of any great actor when they can alternate between roles. Likewise, Ashley Laurence, with her acting talent and stunning good looks playing the role of his daughter Kristy, creates a more sympathetic and interesting character than all the expendable bimbos from countless horror movies. Meanwhile Claire Higgins plays it cold and calculating and is really effective as Julia - Larry's wife &#x96; the woman who sets everything on its downward spin.This is also the movie that gave us a truly iconic character to rival Freddy Kruger in the form of 'Pinhead'. Even though he is never actually referred to this name, Pinhead cuts an imposing and strangely tragic figure when we first see him with all those nails driven into his face. Doug Bradley invests his limited role with a lot of depth - another rarity. This is no idiotic knife-wielding thug we know instantly Pinhead actually possesses intelligence.The film has jaw-dropping effects it's full of astonishing scenes that still hold up today. Most appealing of all is as this was made before the CGI era, all the effects are done with animatronics, optical effects and reverse footage. The disturbing metamorphosis scene where Frank comes back to life is similar to the one seen in An American Werewolf in London in that we get a no holds barred, shot by shot transmutation of a creature in all its gory (and gooey) glory. Unlike that scene, however, which was over lit, this one is photographed with more a more effective and moodier lighting scheme. Gut wrenching though it is, the scene also has a strange kind of beauty to it. It's quite nice (if icky) to look at. Beauty in blood and guts &#x96; there are not many horror movies that can boast a contradiction like that.Hellraiser was clearly ahead of its time. Its influence on movies that came later cannot be underestimated. After all, this is the film that gave us the whole 'Torture Porn' genre at least two decades before the term had even coined by the media. Movies like Saw and Hostel owe a lot to it and could not have existed without Hellraiser paving the way first. Even though these movies are a dime a dozen now, this was something new in its day, giving us an unflinching view of bodies being mutilated and torn apart in gratuitous fashion. But even at that, there was always something more going on than just simple gore Hellraiser is about the desperate steps a woman will take to rekindle an unforgettable past affair.There is only one sticking point, though in a movie that's supposed to be set in England, why is it that all extras/supporting players speak with badly put on/dubbed American accents? There is no logical reason for this. It's a bad call in a film that does almost everything else so well.For the remake there's no question they will replace a lot of the practical effects we see here with 'state of the art' CGI. But will it look as good in twenty years? Probably not, but the original will still have the raw power it has today. That's the hallmark of any great movie. This has more ideas in ten minutes than lesser horror movies have crammed into their entire 80 &#x96; 90 minute running times. And while it may not be to everyone's tastes &#x96; least of all those with easily upset stomachs - Hellraiser remains a masterpiece of imaginative film-making, as brilliant and significant now as it was on its original release.

It's just enough to make you feel uncomfortable without crossing the line of being distasteful. The designs of the Cenobites are both unique and eerie. The music also adds atmosphere to the film, creating tension for the audience. In contrast to other horrors films of the era, such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween, and Friday the 13th, the monsters are not mindless slashers.

Their role is to introduce any who summon them to all forms of physical and mental extremity, pain, pleasure, torment, joy, in equal measure. Thing is, one of their victims appears to have escaped their clutches, and when he turns up in an old English house after having been resurrected by the blood of his brother, they are eager to get him back.Some outstanding moments really lift this above the norm - Frank's resurrection, the first glimpses of his skinned persona, the Cenobites' appearances - and Barker imbues the whole thing with a real sense of menace.Flawless and stylish, this is horror at its best.

Clive Barker's most famous and most brilliant film is doubtlessly one of the most spine-chilling cinematic experiences one can have. Even if he had made nothing but this movie, Hellraiser would be sufficient to earn Clive Barker the title of an absolute master of Horror, as this terrifying cult film has everything one could possibly desire in Horror. The film is extremely creepy and genuinely scary and maintains a terrifying atmosphere from the beginning to the end, the plot is ingenious, the makeup and gore-effects are as gruesome as it gets, and the Cenobites, above all the iconic Pinhead, are some of the most frightening creatures in the history of Horror cinema.The film already begins ingeniously, when Frank (Sean Chapman) purchases a cube which serves as the key to the doorway to Hell. Years later, Frank's brother Larry (Andrew Robinson) and his wife Julia (Clare Higgins), who had an affair with the sardonic Frank, move into Frank's old house. When blood is spilled on the floor of the room in which Frank has performed the rite to enter hell, the gates of hell are re-opened, releasing Frank from the inferno. The horribly deformed Frank, who consists so far of flesh and bones only, needs blood in order to regain his old body, and he needs it fast, before the Cenobites, horrible demons, take notice of his escape from the torments of their bizarre, sadomasochistic hell...There is no doubt that Hellraiser is one of the most terrifying Horror films ever made. The torments and gore effects are gruesome as hell, and the great setting and superb cinematography only improve on the film's creepiness. The probably scariest aspect of the film however, are the characters (brilliantly brought to life with incredible makeup), as well as the ultra-demented storyline. The character of Frank, the hell-escapee, is sardonic enough, but it is the bizarre and genuinely frightening Cenobites who stand out as some of the chosen few scariest Horror-villains in the history of the genre. Especially their leader (Doug Bradley), who is commonly known as Pinhead (even though only credited as Lead Cenobite) epitomizes the term Horror - even if the 'Chattering Cenobite' arguably looks even more terrifying. Beautiful Ashley Laurence makes the most lovable character as Kirsty, Larry's daughter from a previous marriage. Even though the gore is not the most important aspect of Hellraiser, some of it has yet to find an equal. The torments of the Cenobites, which include hooks attached to chains that tear people apart, are just plain horrifying.

The second part of the story we have bondage styled demons, a puzzle box which opens another dimension.Adultery, lust, murder, curiosity, pain and pleasure are the main dishes and even though the supernatural elements are presented very strongly, they never drown the core of what's going on. That's quite a feat, I still don't know how Barker pulled it off.Without a doubt, the strength of the film relies on Julia and Frank's relationship. It's when the film focuses on them and their actions that it is at its strongest. The subplot with the bug-eating vagrant also worked. He complements the film's weird aura and brings everything full circle. I also liked the role the Cenobites play in this flick. Their background players who are there to serve the story, not drive it. This story is about humans, not the history/past of blue demons. It works better this way.This film is definitely on top form the makers did a bang up job mixing elements of family life and demons from another world folded into one, and the gore is well and truly disgusting like skinless bodies, hammer hits to the head and heads ripped apart by hooks definitely not for ones with weak stomachs.The rest of the film is almost devoid of tension and the finale which is supposed to have you on the edge of your seat, betrays the first hour by going the light show way with some bad visuals (the vanquishing of the Cenobites, the hall demon).There are parts of this film that don't really make sense and Barker loses himself a bit in his over ambition and unfortunately the budget is not up for it.The acting in this movie ranges, (Andrew Robinson) Larry does fine as the husband/father really likable but not very interesting, Clare Higgins (Julia) plays the murderous bitch perfectly. Ashley Laurence is also really strong a perfect lead heroine and glad they bought her back for the sequel. Sean Chapman (Frank) was simply average and Kirsty's boyfriend not very interesting at all and rather pointless and wooden.The film is slick and a strong narrative and doesn't shy away from anything.All in all Hellraiser may not be tasteful, a lot of people will find this film simply unsettling, but if you're in a mood for something different then i'd recommend this.

Made especially for the real horror fan who is always on the lookout for an original story, interesting characters (and fine acting) , creative and cool special effects. This flick is now a classic along with parts 2 & 3 and I sincerely hope they are neither remade nor updated - I guess they can't get any better than this - the mythos is rich and a myriad of very creative films could be made out of it - at least 1000 wonderful stories, exploring the cenobite universe and human frailty. I do agree that the sequels from part 4 on (although all interesting and intriguing) need to be improved/ remade for the real Hellraiser fan.Doug Bradley needs to be brought back to display his acting prowess and must be cast as Pinhead again, as he is the most human Cenobite of all, the richest and finest of all too. One of the icons of horror films.Unfortunately studios tend now to make faster, cheaper and (and I don't know why - fear maybe - to do something daring or shocking)clichéd movies. Studios all work on a tight budget, very little time available,and so on. Curiously, the best horror movies were made this way - Halloween, Re-animator... So it seems to be that what lack studios today are creative gutsy people (say to the producer(s) let's not film it this way - but that way - at least try) I am also against fan club crossovers  Hellraiser X Prophecy, Hellraiser Vs Michael Myers,... as they will only be byproducts of great stories and characters - they can't be blended 100% as these great stories are totally different and deal with different subjects. Hellraiser hell definitely isn't typical catholic/ religion hell,and can't be. Michael Myers is the personification of human evil - not supernatural evil and Prophecy is based on catholicism and similar religions. Hellraiser, like many low budget films, is not perfect(because money always make a difference), but it is original, fresh, intriguing,daring and 100% creative, which alone deserves to be praised and to be seen.

Soon, the Cenobites discover that Frank has escaped their grasp and Larry's daughter Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) is caught in the mix.my thoughts This is one of the most original and shocking horror films out there. It is a family saga and a gory horror movie in one.I loved the characters and the actors portraying them. Especially Clare Higgins as the cold and conniving Julia, Ashley Laurence as the cute innocent Kirsty, and Doug Bradley as the Lead Cenobite Pinhead, who is one of the most popular horror movie monsters ever created.I loved how in this film, the Cenobites were left lurking in the shadows while the movie mainly focused on the Cotton family. Loss, love affairs and hints of past incest are what makes this a very provocative drama/horror film. I also loved some of the directing techniques - mainly going back and forth to Kirsty solving the puzzle and a rose blooming on the television. Christopher Young also provided one of my favorite horror scores, which is tied with Pino Donnagio's work on CARRIE.This film isn't without flaws though - the subplot with Kirsty's boyfriend brought nothing good to the film, especially since he can't act surprised. I mean, he comes to his girlfriend's father's house to find her battling demons with a puzzle box - and still there is no expression on his face. The special effects also show that the film is on a low budget.Still, this is one of the greatest horror films of all time and they do not make them like this anymore!

Pinhead is merely a creature, only viewed in vital moments of a twisted love story involving otherworldly torture. He is not even called pinhead, he is the lead cenobite, and he will tear your soul apart!The story has a strong narrative hold on a family, and the unresolved matters they have never approached. Such matters include drugs, theft, scandal, love, lust, and demonic dealings. Larry Cotton and his 2nd wife, Julia are happy, cozy, and ready to break new ground as they move into the new home. Unbeknownst to them, an unwelcomed family member is waiting, and so is the awesome force that sealed his fate in life, and in death. This film has more than demons and angels. This film has a plot. Julia helps frank after he narrowly escapes death. Slow, and sure, she feeds him blood, and the lust for life, love, and control takes over the both of them. Soon, Larry's daughter, Kirsty is involved, and the real nightmare begins. This film is more of a fantasy than anything else, as it plays on mystical elements like dreams, love, life, and death. Barker crafts his original novel, titles The Hellbound Heart into a fantastic mold of a supernatural plunge into a very messed up family. More so, this film is a tale of otherworldly pain and torture. Torture is not just the killing, it is the emotional state that Julia is trapped in, as she loves Larry...at first. Soon she is torn between real love, and the lust for pleasure, both physical and emotional. The cenobites take all the emotions, and play with them as though they were throwing a ball back and forth. Barker introduces hell as both emotional, and physical states of mind. No matter where the characters are, hell is what they get. Brilliant performances also highlight this one, with special effects that challenge even todays standards. Good Job Barker!

As far as fright flicks go, this is the cream of the crop. A must-see for all self-respecting horror fans; I can't imagine anyone being disappointed.The best horror films, whether they rate high or low on the gore factor (and this one is about as high as it gets without pushing into NC-17 territory), work by engaging the viewer's most powerful, negative emotions. This one works overtime to evoke feelings of disgust, right from the get-go,focusing on the the mysterious peddler's filthy fingernails as he passes over that all-important puzzle box.Images like rats, flies, roaches, maggots,rusty nails, musty attics,and clear, slimy-gooey mucus/protoplasm stuff abound throughout the film. Whatever really makes makes you unbearably, squeamishly uncomfortable, it's probably in here somewhere, and not just in the visuals. The film touches on a host of disturbing, emotionally distressing themes, some fleeting, others more thoroughly. What's your personal sore spot? The death of a parent? Infidelity? Depraved sex? Creepy old houses? Hospitals? Incest? Being stalked? Personal betrayal? Necrophilia? Your family being threatened from someone outside? The fear of your own buried potential for violence, of going insane, of going to hell? Whatever it is, there's something here to gnaw at virtually anyone's rawest nerve- but better yet, it also provides eventual relief from all.The most fascinating element to me was the contrast between human and demonic evil. While the latter is the most horrifying, the former is by far th most evil. There's even a certain purity to the cenobites- they'll do horrible things to you, yes, but they won't lie; they have no reason to. I had the feeling that while the cenobites could not exist without human depravity, human depravity could very well exist without the cenobites, so who's the real monster here. There aren't too many innocent victims here, and most of the characters basically get what they deserve.I have only one gripe about this film- the blood. It's very, very, unconvincing- it looks like Smucker's strawberry flavored pancake syrup. With all the effort that went into making awesomely awful monsters, you'd think they'd gotten some halfway decent blood. Oh, well.

I find that it tests the limits of fear.It takes you to the gross-out without triggering the gag reflex. It horrifies you, terrorizes you, if only you can believe.The portrayals are not Oscar-worthy, but neither is the subject matter.I can't imagine Hollywood, even at its most open minded state, ever considering a true horror as a contestant for one of their most prized awards. If they snubbed Tombstone, then Hellraiser never had a chance.*LOL* That having been said, the portrayals are realistic and reactionary, and seem to be genuine. That's about all you could hope for in a movie as low budget as this was.The story, on the other hand, is another...story. It is about the highest creative show we horror fans have seen in at least a generation. Hellraiser has new monsters, a new darkness, a new face, but more than that, it has a new feel.

Hellraiser has to also be one of the goriest horror movies to come out of the 80's.  The special effects here are horrific.  The scene where Frank comes out from underneath the floor is very gross and hard to watch.  The Cenobites, in my opinion, are the best part of the movie.  My favorites are Pinhead and The Chatterer.

Its special effects wizardry extends beyond the cheap illusion of animatronics but is also not weighted down by the modern components of CGI.  (Which can detract as well as add to a film's credibility)The film is disturbing in its exploitation of gore and vulgarity...but when one considers the subject matter...that is, being cast into Hell, you should expect to find the most disturbing and visually disgusting aspects that run along with it.The one element that makes Hellraiser rise above its contemporaries is that the Cenobites are not the antagonists of this film.  They are merely there to carry the plot along and to provide some gruesome and horrific details in response to the actions of the other characters.  The true antagonists or villains of the film are Frank and Julia Cotton.  Julia's infidelity and Frank's deviant behavior is what paves the way for the Cenobites.  Larry is the victim and Kirsty represents the victorious youth that refuses to yield to the corruption of her forebearers.  IMHO, this is what makes Pinhead and his brethren stand out above other such notables as Jason Voorhees, Freddy Kruger and even Michael Myers.  He is the trickiest of movie monsters, because he does not hunt or stalk or prey upon his victims.  He is only there because someone else wants him to be.  I beleive that THAT is the true horror that is signified in the first film.  Barker showcases the literal characterization of personal demons.

In this case, that point is a sympathetic, even provocative, connection of the genre to what might be called underground sexuality.  The entire premise of Hellraiser is allure of the forbidden, and the eventual difficulty in distinguishing pleasure from pain, excitement from fear.  (And after all, doesn't that say a lot about the horror film & fiction genre as a whole?In more mundane terms, Hellraiser has also been highly influential visually, and one can see clear echoes of it in later films like Jacob's Ladder, Dark City, Edward Scissorhands, The Cube, and Event Horizon (the last two of which might as well be considered unofficial sequels of Hellraiser - in the former, people are trapped in a menacing giant puzzlebox of sorts the surface designs of which are reminiscent of the Hellraiser box, while in the former the gateway to a hellish other dimension is a sphere that looks like it was made by the same force as created the Hellraiser cube - and there's even some common dialog! See if you find it - there's only a word or two difference, and the creepy invitation is delivered almost exactly the same way.)Subculturally, the fetish/gothic/industrial scenes have taken a major clue from the Hellraiser series antagonist-cum-antihero Pinhead and his Cenobites (and secondarily from his ironic alterego of sorts, Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands).  Pinhead is a PIB (people in black) icon.  You'll see Pinhead costumes at fetish balls, fetish art like that of Michael Manning shows obvious Cenobite influences, the fetishwear displayed in publications like Skin Two often looks like it was designed for the demons of Hellraiser, and what's a darkwave party without a styrofoam mannequin head full of toothpicks and painted to look like Pinhead (for the hors d'oeuvres, of course)?Influentiality aside, is it a good movie?  Absolutely.  The acting is first-rate for a production of this  funding level (and better than many far more expensive films), the actual horror really is pretty scary, and in a creepy, subliminal way as well as sudden-shock, in-your-face way.This alone sets it apart from about 90% of other non-B horror films (and 99% of B-movie horror films).  You can thank original author Clive Barker for that.  The sets are not only believable but imaginative.  The multi-continental cast lends a worldly and less parochial sense (contrast the Scream series; it's almost retch-inducingly way American). Hellraiser's characters are absolutely unforgettable, and amazingly they are ALL simultaneously repulsive and sympathetic, from Frank and his needy desperation combined with heartless viciousness, to Kirsty and her innocence (which is both annoying and grounding), to the Cenobites and their juxtaposed sinister menace and righteous hedonism, their mixture of exploratory fascination and loathsome outright psychopathology (not to mention their conflicting present selves and ultimate origins, which you don't learn about until Hellbound Hellraiser II.)  And the whole fantasy meshes well with our culturally-derived notions about the dangers of black magic, the tricks inherent in a deal with the devil, and the sexual yet torturous nature of Hell.  On top of all that, the plot is solid, the pace just what it should be, the very slight humor breaks needed but subtle, and the premise of Hell as a dimension or sidereal alternative reality is a wonderful modern take on the Underworld, far more plausible than a Dantéan subterrain.The only points worth criticizing would be the special effects. Some of them are downright hokey by today's standards.  When the film was made they were all passable, but imperfect.  This could eventually be improved be a Star Wars Special Edition-style overhaul, replacing the cartoon electricity and rubbery muppet minions with (or overlaying and improving them with) computer-generated effects.  Others will disagree of course, but they have the existing version of the film to satisfy them.If one can suspend disbelief of the somewhat lacking special effects, Hellraiser is a fantastic and disturbingly enjoyable film, the influence of which is certain to be felt for decades to come.

It's a real treat for horror fans & remains one of my top ten favourite horror movies! Unlike a lot of horror films, HELLRAISER wastes no time in getting to the action! It manages to grab the viewers attention almost immediately, as we see a man (FRANK COTTON) buying what looks to be a harmless musical puzzle box from an Asian Man at a small store, upon opening it, Frank is literally torn to shreds & the room he is in, is suddenly transformed into a torture chamber, full of chains & body parts strewn about! (A word of caution, don't watch this movie, before, during or after eating!) Unlike the latter sequels that followed this, Pinhead (Here dubbed Lead Cenobite) & his cenobite followers barely have any screen time, in fact they are mere window dressing to the films real story. The special effects by BOB KEEN are really fantastic here & some of the best to ever grace a horror movie, including the Frank monster, who is seen is several stages, first as a dry husk of a corpse & then a half bloody one & then a bloody, skinless monster, his resurrection from under the floor boards is a real fantastic piece of work!. The gore is good & plenty but never gratuitous believe it or not, since it actually serves the films story. We see rats twitching in a death spasm, as they have been nailed to the wall by Frank, who at one point even skins a dead rat! various victims are bludgeoned with a hammer, a nail ripping through a hand, a head is ripped in half along with the rest of the body that is torn into by hooks & chains, a person literally pulled apart by hooks & left strewn all over a room, a steaming bloody corpse, maggot infused rotting corpses also lie about. The cenobites themselves are very well done & articulated, a really colourful cavalcade of monsters, who are adorned in black leather, with sewn up wounds, nails encrusted into their flesh & their bodies pierced, they spend the early half in the shadows, before coming to light in the latter half of the film. What I really liked about HELLRAISER, is that at a time when the otherworldly monsters were considered the main villains & their human counterparts the good guys, HELLRAISER does a radical shift in tone, by making the human characters, (in this films case FRANK & JULIA) the real monsters of the piece & not the cenobites! Unlike a lot of horror films of it's period, HELLRAISER has a very fresh & original plot for a horror movie. It's main story is not about monsters, but rather infidelity, murder, hedonism, excess & temptation & back stabbing the ones a person loves or pretends to love, in order to fulfil their own desires, no matter how much it may hurt others or manipulate them. The character of Frank really stands out, he's a rather disturbing character, who's lust for sex is never quenched or satisfied to his fulfilment, & shares a very sickening attraction to his niece Kirsty, that is quiet disturbing. The acting is very well done here & the score by CHRISTOPHER YOUNG is absolutely fantastic! CLIVE BARKER making his feature film directorial debut, really amazes one with his fantastic knack for directing (Written from his own novel, THE HELLBOUND HEART). his vision is fierce & unrelenting. What's worth noting is how some element of Barker's novel was changed for the film version, Larry was originally called Rory & Kirsty was a co-worker of his, the Wall Crawler demon seen in the film, was known as the Engineer & Frank's opening the portals of hell at the beginning, sees him get sexually massaged by some faceless female cenobites, what's notable here, is how the engineer name, the faceless white designs of the cenobites, seen on the cover art & described in the novel, all turned up in HELLRAISER INFERNO. The film is almost unbearably suspenseful at times, such as scenes where Kirsty investigates the house while no one else is there & then winds up being caught in a room by the skinless Frank, the scene where she is visited by the cenobites in a hospital, being chased down a long dark labyrinth by a wall crawling demon, trying to escape the sadistic Frank in a twisted game of cat & mouse, after she has murdered her dad & step mother & the cenobites attempting to take Kirsty back to their world at the end & her final fight with the Wall Crawler, that wants the box that is in her possession. HELLRAISER also sports some creepy moments, more particularly a dirty bum that seemingly follows Kirsty around & is revealed at the end to be a terrifying demon. Indeed HELLRAISER is a near perfect horror film, that barely has any downsides to it, which is a rarity with a lot of horror films especially in all my years of reviewing horror films, in fact in my eyes the only downside this film has is (presumably at the behest of the studio) a potential love interest is introduced for Larry's teenage daughter Kirsty, in that of Steve, this character adds nothing to the film, feels forced in, is not interesting & thankfully Barker doesn't seem to like this idea either & spends very little time on it. To me it's nothing more than a forced & watered down love story that could so easily have been written around.All in all, I highly recommend HELLRAISER to any horror fan who hasn't seen it yet! It's a very worthwhile horror movie, that is never boring & always manages to keep one watching, as it engrosses them into it's well written & captivating story.

There is no real witchcraft without Vogel stimulation. If with but the faith of a mustard seed you say to this mountain move it shall be moved.

Yes, it's full of blood as well as a fair amount of sex. Yes, the story is questionable at best. And yes, the acting was awful from a lot of the cast, but Hellraiser is nonetheless one of the most distinctive horror films ever made. Despite all of its numerous flaws, Hellraiser succeeds because it is so different from the typical slasher horror film, a subgenre that was created almost single-handedly by John Carpenter's 1978 classic, Halloween.Clive Barker comes up with some of the most original and fascinating (as well as probably the most recognizable) characters in horror history with the Cenobites, particularly Pinhead. Everything about this character (as well as the other cenobites, but to a lesser extent) just radiates pure evil. The grey/white skin color, the hellish leather costume, the voice, the nails driven into his head, his EYES, all of these characteristics combine perfectly to make-up the most original and sinister horror characters in decades. Not only all that, but there is not a single other character out there who even vaguely resembles him, and this is extremely rare. This is one of the things that makes him so overpowering, no one has ever seen anyone like this before, nor has anyone come up with anything like him since. However, despite the breathtakingly fascinating and frightening cenobites, there is little to be said for Hellraiser. The gory make-up of Frank, as he slowly comes back to life, was amazingly convincing and sickening (with the exception of the primitive reverse motion photography), but the story and the acting were both mediocre. The story concerns a man who spends a ridiculous amount of money on some sort of evil puzzle box in search of the ultimate sensual experience, and instead he is dealt hell by the Cenobites, who respond whenever the box is solved (why this is true is not revealed until part III). His previous lover, now married to his brother, tries to bring him back to life when her new husband accidentally bleeds on the wrong wooden floor, beginning the process of bringing Frank back to life. Now Julia, Frank's former lover, is faced with the challenge of feeding Frank numerous victims in order to complete the process. This sickening love story is rather difficult to believe, seeing how I feel that no human being on Earth would fall in love with something that looked the way that Frank did early in his resurrection, regardless of how much they loved him when he was alive. Neither Andrew Robinson as Larry or Claire Higgins as Julia were very convincing, although they both delivered much better performances than did Ashley Laurence, who comes forth with probably (HOPEfully) the worst performance of her forgettable career. This was obviously her movie acting debut, she made that clear in every forced and annoying sob that escaped her mouth. There is not much to be said about the story, acting, or even the direction (an area in which I expected more from Clive Barker, having read many of his books, despite the fact that this was his directorial debut), but Hellraiser is a horror film that is not soon to be forgotten. It deals with the very human issues of greed, indulgence, and even loyalty. However, this is not the type of film you watch if you want to learn a lesson in any of those areas. Because of that, Hellraiser works best as an all-out gory horror film, the kind of movie that you would watch with your buddies late at night just to have a good time. It is not a film for all tastes (despite its morbidly appealing cover), many people will surely dislike it. But anyone who is even remotely into scary movies should not miss it under any circumstance.

My favorite film will be definitely this one. A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) is my favorite horror slasher flick, but Hellraiser is not behind him, is definitely my second favorite horror film in the horror slasher genre. This film is very scary and I seriously love the main heroine Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence). I love her character for been such a decent human being, who found out about her father been in great danger and what her step mother is doing with her uncle behind her back. This flick was released the same year that A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors come out (another horror film that I love). This horror awesome film is based on Clive Barker's novel The Hellbound Heart, which he also wrote a script for the film. I am not the biggest horror film fan like are other people, I definitely hate Halloween (1978) and the series franchise because I always have nightmares. But Hellraiser is different and it is similar too a Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), which both of the genre are decent. I read somewhere that Clive Barker and Ashley Laurence don't want to talk about Hellraiser anymore and that is very sad. Doug Bradley's character Pinhead is a decent true horror icon that I love. I love Hellraiser to death and in the series franchise the first Hellraiser is my number 1 horror film.You set me up, bitch! Plot An unfaithful wife encounters the zombie of her dead lover; demons are pursuing him after he escaped their sadomasochistic underworld.The plot about the film is simple, it is entertaining, fast paced not boring and goes really fast. It is well edited, the special effects are beautiful and acting is very decent. Andrew Robinson did an excellent job portraying his character Larry Cotton. I really love him in this movie. Andrew Robinson also portrayed Scorpio in Dirty Harry (1971) and he also played Detective Monte in Stallone's Cobra (1986) a year earlier, before he went to star in Hellraiser. Ashley Laurence is very beautiful, gorgeous and touching, smart intelligent horror heroine. Clare Higgins as Julia Cotton was awesome as the main villain, Sean Chapman as Frank the other villain was also great, but the most that I love in this film is Doug Bradley as Pinhead.In the opening scene we found a man who opens a puzzle box with portal of heaven and earth and the Cenobites pulls him and his soul in the hell and hooked chains emerge and tear him apart. Man and wife move into an old house and discover a hideous creature - the man's half-brother, who is also the woman's former lover - hiding upstairs. Having lost his earthly body to a trio of S&M demons, the Cenobites, an accident causes some of Larry's blood to spill on the attic floor, which somehow triggers Frank's resurrection. To complete his resurrection, he requires more blood which Julia provides while Kirsty discovers Frank's puzzle box which leads her to meet with the Cenobites. On the end of the film I turn's out in to a battle of fits, when Kirsty finds out that the Cenobites will not hold up to their deal, but they are double crossing her and they will tear her sole anyway apart. With the help of the puzzle box she fights for her life and her survival, while she defeats the Cenobites.I got yesterday this film on Blu-ray and I seriously wish, I would have watch this movie as a teen. Like I said this film is a cult classic is far way better than John Carpenter's Halloween and far way better than a dozen Texas Chain Saw Massacre films and way much better than any Friday the 13th movies. I will rather watch this films than those horror film I mentioned. I haven't saw all Hellraiser movies, I only got six movies on Blu-ray and this is the second time I have watch this movie.Overral Hellraiser is a horror slasher classic, that is based on Clive Barker's book The Hellbound Heart.

I was about to start secondary school, and my friend Ben told me about a free midnight showing at the movie theater near my house. So it's the middle of the night, and I think to myself hell, it's free - why not? And then the movie starts. A man buys a mysterious puzzle box from a stranger in a foreign country. The stranger says Take it, it's yours. And the man walks away. Then the stranger says It always was. . And then the puzzle box opens up and hooks fly out of it and tear the man into pieces.And this film does work and does still hold up to the extent that it does because the film isn't really about the Cenobites - it's immediately about Julia, Frank, and Larry, the things we do for love (the novella was called The Hellbound Heart), and the price we pay for desire (Frank betraying Julia to get a crack at Kirsty, for example). More distally, it's about the corrupting influence of the box as it comes into other people's lives. To the extent that the film is about the box and those it encounters, it works more effectively in a multiple-film framework because you can tell all kinds of stories within that, and I think that's why the film opens and closes on scenes of people acquiring the box. But that's not the direction in which future films would go. Future films would, instead - at least for awhile - focus on the Cenobites as franchisable characters "},{"Title":"Audiences had no idea what hit them in 1987 when Hellraiser hit movie theater screens.","Date":"4 February 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Audiences had no idea what hit them in 1987 when Hellraiser hit movie theater screens.As everyone knows now, this film turned out to be a launching pad for the one element that has remained constant in all of its sequels Pinhead, essentially the leader of the Cenobites, played with theatrical relish by Doug Bradley. Though he and his cadre have only a few minutes of screen time here, his pincushion face and dark eyes were enough to make him the literal poster Hellraiser boy for this film and its mascot in all future installments. With that in mind, newcomers may be surprised at the darkly romantic tone of this first film, which plays with tropes like the evil stepmother and doomed lovers.Apart from Bradley, the most valuable performers here are definitely Laurence, a very likable heroine at a time when good final girls were in short supply, and Higgins and Robinson, who have fun with their roles for reasons that can't be expounded upon here without spoiling the finale. (Robinson's final line was improvised on the spot and remains one of the greatest moments in late '80s horror.) It's also a visually striking film with lots of bold lighting, inventive makeup designs, and nifty production design, all supported by a memorably barnstorming music score by the great Christopher Young (a New World favorite stepping in when the studio rejected an early submission by British group Coil). Unfortunately New World's involvement led to a few unfortunate issues, namely the imposition of atrocious, disturbingly flat American dubbed voices on Chapman (and his skinless incarnation played by Oliver Smith) and Hines, which sound absolutely awful and flat. Few viewers noticed the tinkering, however, and the film became a big hit despite a lot of critical grousing at the time like Roger Ebert's half-star review that posed the question, Who goes to see movies like this?

As a director though, he's only done 3 films including 'Hellraiser', Nightbreed and Lord of Illusions, both movies made in the 90's. As a horror writer though, some may declare him a little sick in the head, or just a little looney, but he's actually a very gifted man. Sure some of the stuff he writes is twisted, but it's brutally artistic and beautiful, the man is a legend in the business of horror. This movie though is actually very twisted, it's one of the craziest and creepiest horror movies I've had the time to check out lately. The film isn't bent on gore or endless nudity to satisfy us, but on pure terror, the gruesomeness of the movie is enough to make anyone feel a little off balance.So, here we have Clive Barker's directorial debut, which has now become a cult classic.

Frank, presumably unsatisfied and unsated by earthly pursuits, desires the ultimate in pleasure/pain and ventures into a sadistic realm via a small, golden Rubik's-like cube. He is torn to pieces within five minutes in an empty room and his still-living remains are re- assembled by a demon that came to be known as 'Pinhead'. His name is a giveaway. Cut to Frank's brother, Larry, and his reclamation of the family's old house. We know that Frank's wife, Julia, had an affair with Frank and it's that physical experience of utter abandonment that has consumed her to the point of (some may argue) unreasonableness via a number of murderous hammer blows. Blood is spilled and Frank's soul physically sprouts from the floorboards in a make up effects extravaganza that, in its time, was an eye watering special effect. I mean, this guy rebuilds himself, vein by vein, muscle by muscle, in front of our eyes. It's a startling creation. Julia has to lure men to murder them in order to get Frank to feed and to become physically human again.Claire Higgins as Julia does a superb job in convincing me that the love and ownership of a man - now only in her memory as he starts to regenerate from the bones up &#x96; is so powerful that she would pretend to seduce strangers and then reign down on them with a hammer. It takes some skill to make this stuff work. Ably abetting her in his enforced ordinariness is her husband played at first with a straight nice-guy goody dad 'can't stand the sight of blood' vibe by Outsider favourite Andrew Robinson. The fact he gets a chance to do what he does best in the last act of the movie is a delayed treat. Robinson, of course, was the sniper in Dirty Harry and the venal but secretive Garak in Star Trek Deep Space Nine. He does creepy in his sleep and is especially good at illustrating with very little, the joy his characters get from being utterly sociopathic. Doing an admirable job whilst swathed in eerily convincing skinless body stages is Oliver Smith playing Frank resurrected. Rounding up the acting talent is a nod to the 80s ideal of young and sexy (big hair!) is Ashley Laurence as Kirsty, the daughter (importantly the step-daughter to Julia). In some ways she has the hardest part playing 'us'. She does what we'd do if confronted by the horrors she runs into &#x96; scream and run away. Well, that's what I'd do. Her grounded and honest performance. The plot is engaging, the acting is excellent, and the camera work is astounding considering the budget, but it is in imagery that this film excels. The cenobites, lead by Pin Head, are makeup marvels. Pin Head has rightly become an horror icon and Doug Bradley's portrayal, particularly his voice, is perfect for the powerful, amoral demon. When he says We have such sights to show you, I find myself wondering how extraordinary those sights would be, and how horrifying. The dangling chains, hooks, and blood add to the atmosphere. On top of all that is Christopher Young's majestic score. "},{"Title":"What can be said about Hellraiser that hasn't already been said?

It was quite a trip.What can be said about Hellraiser that hasn't already been said? It's a classic film.The first Hellraiser film has always reminded me of a sort of European soap opera, with skinless bodies and cenobites from hell. The whole thing plays out like a terrifying nightmare that seems all too real. It really frames the 80s quite well and serves as a definite example of cultural zeitgeist. An example of a man who has grown weary of the pleasures of earth and toys with the things that simple shouldn't be touched.Clare Higgins is amazing as Julia, and the character of Frank is well played as well. With that being said, I thought Ashley Laurence's' Kirsty to be very annoying.

The degrading quality of the franchise is something of a trick though as the original Hellraiser is not only spectacular, but it still retains significant impact. Clive Barker's directing debut is a whopper of a film (it helps he wrote it too) and there a plenty of things to admire about this low budget masterpiece of atmospheric weight and horrific and meaningful gore. At its foundation, Hellraiser is a film about domestic fracturing. And honestly, on its bare bones this story has been done before, but it's the details that make this story worth it. Character relationships, like the unusual connections between the step-mother and uncle and how the daughter is treated, make this film a little more human then what a normal story about opening the gate way to hell could have been if the focus was on the Cenobites and their arrival. It's these details with the characters, along with some stellar performances, are what make this tale so impactful and still very personal proportions.Oddly enough, for a film crafted in 1987, Hellraiser has aged like a fine wine that allows its little nuances to only get better with time. Many films date far too quickly, yet Hellraiser to this day still packs as much punch as it was the first time I saw it. Clive Barker and company do a lot of great things on this film, including character development, flow, set designs, and of course the horrific special effects, but what makes Hellraiser such a great experience is the little things. Like the quick and precise editing, the bombastic classical and creepy score, or even just some of the sound effects like the chiming bells in the back ground of the coming Cenobites. intense horror story with stunning special effects and atmosphere out the yahzoo.I must say that Hellraiser is still one of the best horror films ever made in my book. It's lasted the test of time and even though some of the special effects and clothing may seem dated (although I would argue the return of Frank is one of the coolest ideas and creepiest scenes I have ever witnessed) this film is one that will last on the books for its universality and its unabated boundaries.

Based on Mr. Barker's novella, A Hellbound Heart, Hellraiser first opened our eyes September 18th, 1987, in theaters both throughout the United States and the UK.Clive Barker's his debut film, he directs a horror befitting of his own truly twisted tale. The practical effects, despite the budget, are fantastic. The gruesome creations, including the now iconic Pinhead, are masterpieces of horror. Pinhead and the Hellraiser franchise would go on to stretch to nine films, a comic series and make a cult star of lead actor Doug Bradley. Whilst the Hellraiser franchise never matched the financial and mainstream popularity of bigger horror juggernauts like Halloween, A Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th the increasingly-iconic image of Pinhead has bled into the public consciousness and the pinned-being remains a titan of the genre to horror fans. Despite the immediate recognizability of main antagonist Pinhead to casual film fans - many of them have not seen Hellraiser film - let alone could not connect Pinhead to the Hellraiser series.Upon rewatching the later Hellraiser films, something bizarre struck me - and that was actually how little Pinhead and his fellow cenobites feature in the series. Whilst audiences thrive on seeing the chaos caused by Pinhead's genre counterparts like Michael Myers, The Tall Man and Freddy Krueger, Pinhead remains a little-used device in the Hellraiser world.These gruesome beings are villains you've never seen before. Barker has not regurgitated the hockey-mask baddie or the knife-wielding psycho. He has created sado-masochistic enemies that are creepy beyond hell. They chatter their teeth as if a constant breeze is blowing. One, nicknamed Pinhead, looks like an acupuncture session gone horribly wrong. Another one looks like a pile of gooey skin.How the Cenobites fit into the movie is left a mystery. This is frustrating, but probably the right move on Barker's part. Knowing the chapter headings, rather than all of the details, keeps them scary and mysterious. Plus, there needs to be room for a sequel.The performances are all fairly well conceived, with Higgins being the best of the bunch. Ashley Laurence's Kirsty, Larry's daughter from a previous marriage, is probably the worst of them, but then again her lines of dialogue are the cheesiest.The special effects for a low-budget horror film from 1987 are impressive. They're not quite on par with John Carpenter's The Thing, but they rank as some of the best in the genre. Frank's reemergence from the zombie state is believable and gruesome.Hellraiser, almost 29 years after its original release, hasn't aged much. It may not scare the socks off genre fans, but it will impress with its originality and dark, dark twists and turns.

The box, when solved, opens a doorway to the world of the Cenobites &#x96; a world which will be fleshed out more thoroughly in the secrets, but within the context of Hellraiser remains largely mysterious.Kirsty's opening of the box summons the Cenobites. 'The box. You opened it. We came', Pinhead tells Kirsty upon their first meeting in the hotel room. 'It's just a puzzle box!', Kirsty protests. 'Oh, no', Pinhead tells her, 'It is a means to summon us'. 'Who are you?', Kirsty asks. 'Explorers in the further regions of experience', Pinhead answers, 'Demons tot some; angels to others. You solved the box; we came. Now you must come with us; taste our pleasures'. Recognising Kirsty's fear, Pinhead tells her, 'Oh, no tears, please. It's a waste of good suffering'.

And as a horror fan chances are that you will enjoy them - the first few movies at the very least.The core of the story of the Hellraiser franchise revolves around a mysterious artifact - an intricate puzzle box - which is said to be able to grant people what they desire the most. But it comes with a price, a terrible, terrible price. And it is guarded by the vile Cenobites.The warped mind of Clive Barker really came up with something wonderfully morbid and disturbing when Hellraiser was first unleashed upon the world. Especially the Cenobites, they are grotesque but interesting at the same time.In the first movie Larry and his wife Julia moves into Larry's old family house. The very same house where his brother Frank tried to unlock the puzzle box and was sent to Hell. An accident causes Larry's blood to be spilled on the floor, bringing back Frank from the dead. But in his flayed and fleshless state of being, Frank needs the blood and flesh of the living in order to regenerate his own body. But no one escapes Hell that easily.For a 1987 movie, I will say that the effects still hold their own today, having withstood the test of time. Especially the rebirth of Frank and his transformation back to fully human. And the Cenobites, lets not forget the Cenobites; they were just amazing.With this now classic horror movie the World saw the likes of Doug Bradley like never before and he instantly became a horror legend, just as Pinhead became a horror icon.I grew up with these horror movies along with other horror franchises, and I love them even today and make frequent visits back to them. If you are not familiar with Hellraiser, shame on you. Then I would strongly recommend that you sit down and watch it, perhaps even do a movie marathon of the series.

The backing of such an icon of horror is high praise indeed, and the fact that Hellraiser still holds up today, 28 years after its release, is a testament to the quality of Clive Barker's hellish vision, based on his own novella, The Hellbound Heart. In an era full of horror movies fronted by broad, almost comic villains, and audiences preferences leaning towards bland American slashers, Hellraiser took a stance as a serious piece of work - rich in atmosphere, disturbing in tone and visually arresting - the foundations on which horror classics are built.Contrary to popular belief (and his over-exposure in the - currently - 8 sequels), Pinhead (Doug Bradley) and his entourage of grotesque Cenobites remain in the background for the majority of the first instalment. The plot instead focuses the grisly fate and gradual re- birth of thrill-seeking scumbag Frank (Sean Chapman), who, in seeking the ultimate sexual enlightenment, purchases a mysterious puzzle box from a Chinese man which opens the gates of Hell when solved. Frank manages to do so, and is impaled by hooks and dragged into a world of torture, mutilation and degradation. Some time later, Frank's brother Larry (Andrew Robinson) and his second wife Julia (Clare Higgins) move into the home previously inhabited by Frank. While moving furniture, Larry cuts his hand on a protruding nail, inadvertently bringing Frank back from Hell and igniting his gruesome re-birth.The plot treads carefully between being mysterious and plain confusing. There are no attempts made to explain just why Larry's blood brings Frank back into the real world and what exactly Frank was hoping to achieve by experiencing Hell, but these small details become insignificant in the wake of such visual splendour and immersing atmosphere. It can also be forgiven for some soap-opera dramatics as Julia's previous infidelity with Frank is exposed, and her manipulation into bringing Frank bodies to feed on while her suspicious step-daughter Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) keep her a watchful eye. Hellraiser employs a slow, careful build-up, so when the true horror springs into life near the end and the Cenobites rear their ugly heads, it is all the more effective for it.Now a fully-fledge horror icon, Pinhead and his cronies are a strange manifestation of deformed monsters and bondage fetishism. They arrive with skin pinned back in various abominable positions, parts of their face and torso pierced with all manners of tools and devices, and all twisted beyond the point of no return by their experiences searching for the ultimate pleasures of the flesh. Part BDSM nightmare and part body horror, Hellraiser's climax is still one of the most disturbing things ever filmed without being particularly scary. Despite its narrative flaws and wobbly plot explanations, Clive Barker's film stands out as one of the finest of its era, spinning a complex and dark mythology around a low-key plot, with the uncanny ability to creep under your skin and stay there for a significant amount of time afterwards.

Its themes are not particularly original the accidental resurrection - Dracula has done that a few times; the need to feed on blood or human flesh to complete that resurrection - something done to greater effect in the 1999 film The Mummy; and invaders from the netherworld. Nevertheless, put them all together with some special effects, and this isn't a bad effort, even if it does take place almost entirely in one house.The bad guy is Frank, who is abominable in death, and wasn't much better in life; his mistress - the wife of his brother - becomes his willing helper, luring no fewer than three unsuspecting men to their deaths on the promise of a bunk up. Needless to say, the third one goes wrong, and here we identify the true damsel, the daughter of Frank's brother; his helper is actually Frank's second wife, for whom the transformation from serial murderess to wicked stepmother is a stroll in the park, but our damsel is not the swooning kind, and thwarts the powers of darkness all but single-handed.Sadly, the ending provides a hint to the sequel, which although not inevitable was clearly on the cards, as indeed was the franchise.

Now that I have seen the movie in its entirety, it still manages to entertain. The premise is like a convoluted love story with gore sprinkled on top. The relationship between Clare Higgin's character with that of her lover is intriguing. She seems to want to escape from her past but cannot resist helping him even in his hideous form. Higgin's performance makes the character complicated, and interesting. You can feel her troubles. Another standout performance is by Doug Bradley as the Pinhead. Every time he and his team come out, there is a feeling of tension because you know something bad will come. Even if he only stands there and talk, you know you don't want him around in the neighborhood. The story itself is not scary, but the theme is dark. The story and performances by Higgins and Bradley greatly lift the material. Ashley Laurence's role as the daughter caught between the events is perfect. The character is not a saint but we still root for her. I think the true horror of this story is knowing nothing is going to end well for anyone involved. While the character Frank is supposed to be the villain, you can still sympathize with him when you see the Cenobites coming. In short, the story works because we fear for all the characters despite their flaws. P.s. the special effects looked great. I still love those effects over CGI.

While there Julia discovers the skinless but alive body of Frank Cotton(Sean Chapman,Oilver Smith)Larry's brother and Julia's former lover who has escaped the clutches of monsters called Cenobites who exist in a puzzle box that when opened unleashes pain and Horror. Frank decides to use Julie to help him get some blood and skin which leads to terror and chaos.Released in 1987,Hellraiser is a brilliant and unforgettable Horror film that was the directorial debut of novelist CLive Barker and was the movie that introduced Barker and one of the all-time iconic characters in Pinhead to the world of Horror. During the time when Slasher movies were all the rage,Hellraiser was released and gave audiences something different and also gave audiences one of the most original,imaginative,twisted and bizarre Horror movies of all-time and one of the finest genre films of the 1980s. Hellraiser is a truly depraved but incredible work of Horror that is like a nightmare coming to life that is ugly,bleak and is a movie that offers no salvation for viewers and puts viewers who are watching the movie through hell and back. Hellraiser is unique because it was the film where S&M was combined with Horror and Fantasy showing viewers a frightening world where somethings are turned on it's headtorture is fun,pain is good mixing together with themes such as murder,death,sex and lust. The scares and terror in Hellraiser are nonstop and they don't happen with jump scares but with the horrific things that the characters go through. The movie is also scary because of the atmosphere which is surrounded by darkness and dread that hangs over the movie like a tightrope and never stops until the very end and when you watch the movie you will feel like no one is safe in any way shape or form. The blood and gore in Hellraiser is effective,brutal and will make you sick to your stomach with it's harshness and will give viewers nightmares for years because it's not just blood and gore for the sake of blood and gore it's there for a reason and makes an impact. Despite Pinhead being on the poster and being the face of the Hellraiser franchise the movie is really about the human characters and the things they go through as well as their interactions with one another and how they deal with the chaos going on in the film. Most Horror movies are never without memorable monsters and in Hellraiser the memorable monsters come in the form of Pinhead(in this film he listed as Lead Cenobite)and the Cenobites. While the Cenobites are only in the movie for a short time(5 to 10 minutes)they add to the movies nightmarish tone because what sets Pinhead and the Cenobites from other Horror villains in the first Hellraiser is that while they are not really good they are not always evil they are Demons to some,Angels to others. The Cenobites come from this puzzle box that is dangerous for the owner because if you open it the Cenobites appear and use chains and hooks to inflict pain or pleasure to the person who owns it which is terrifying and creepy. The Cenobites also have a look that is unique with black leather and different looks with their facesthere's Pinhead,one with no eyes and big teeth,one with a hole in their throat and a butterball with sunglasses. Pinhead and the Cenobites are classic characters you will never forget as long as you live. The ending of Hellraiser is fantastic and is filled with thrills,terror and lots of surprises that will leave viewers on the edge of their seats. A terrific ending.The cast is great. Ashley Laurence is outstanding and beautiful as Kristy,the heroine of the film. Andrew Robinson is wonderful as Larry Cotton,Kristy's Father. Claire Higgins is terrific as Julia,Larry's cheating Wife. Sean Chapman is great as Frank Cotton,Larry's Brother. Oliver Smith is superb as Skinless Frank/Frank The Monster,the villain in the film. Doug Bradley is brilliant and frightening as Pinhead,Lead Cenobite,one Horror films all-time great characters. Nicolas Vincent(Chattering Cenobite),Simon Bamford('Butterball' Cenobite)and Grace Kirby(Female Cenobite)are terrific as the other Cenobites. Robert Hines is decent as Steve,Kristy's boyfriend.The direction by Clive Barker is amazing and stylish,with Barker giving the movie a solid atmosphere and stunning look that is frightening and eerie. Great direction,Barker.The score by Christopher Young is outstanding,epic and iconic and matches the tone of the movie perfectly. Sensational score,Young.The Special and Practical Make-Up Effects are terrific,realistic and well-done.

The first assault comes from the fine music score. From the very first opening credits, Christopher Young seems to be channeling Dominic Frontiere (original Outer Limits) as he imposes somewhat beautiful melodies that are entirely surrounded by a haunting and sad halo. When you hear this music the next time you watch this, that feeling of anticipatory dread and anxiety creeps up your spine. You know what you are in for if you watch this again, but you can't help yourself. This movie is smart. Watching it is like trying to open your own puzzle box (Lament Configuration). Each scene reveals more horror that messes with your head but doesn't reveal too much. You are shocked by what you just experienced, feel repulsed and yet compelled to see more. You find yourself wanting it to take it to the next level. Pain and pleasure. Much of this can be attributed to the very intelligent editing. You end up believing you see more than what is really there. This makes the movie work wonderfully and shores up the dismal budget by making the entire project larger than the sum of the parts. I have heard that this was rated X when it first came out to theaters. There is a sexual theme here but this is far from a sex movie unless you call 'f**king' with your head a form of sex. If this was ever rated X it would have to be because of the frequent graphic violence that by today's standards is not all that bad. The special effects could be made better with a more comprehensive budget, but it probably shouldn't. It has a charm all its own. And yet, the presentation is key. There is a reason for the violence. The individual is, after all, asking for it voluntarily by trying to open the puzzle box. Thus, you don't feel that the Cenobites are necessarily all-consuming monsters since they wreak their own brand of sadism on those who are essentially requesting it. This seems to play out up until the end of the movie when Kirsty at first appears to be allowed to leave the scene when she manages to return escapee Frank back to the Cenobites. This is not for your eyes But as she makes her way down the stairs she is obstructed by one of the Cenobites who tries to back her up the stairs and back into the room. Perhaps Kirsty made the mistake of hanging around too long as she watched Frank's final shredding?? Or perhaps this is the movie that keeps on giving... I have scene it numerous times and would advise not watching it from a television broadcast. They have a nasty tendency to cut the the more graphic scenes which I find entirely necessary to realize the point of the movie in the first place. Who is this movie for? You have to be kind of bent in the head to watch this and appreciate it. Obviously not for those with sensitive dispositions or are prone to innocence. This movie can corrupt and you may never think the same afterward, but you will be entertained nevertheless.

With the villains of the film being the givers of pain and pleasure, they could have done a lot more with it, maybe even show the characters being put through some torture, but I don't mean have them castrated or branded, I mean psychological torture, because that's what sticks in people's mind. I'm not sure if I'm explaining what I mean very good, but the point is, if you're not afraid of gore (And this is 80's gore, the gore that looks fake) then you're probably going to hate this movie.

I am not a big horror fan, but this is one of the best horror films I have ever seen. It is rare that a horror movie is legitimately good or scary. This is not legitimately good, but it does a good job in putting scares into half of the people that watch it. The other half will think of it as a so bad, it's good movie. It is really cheesy with over-the-top gore and death scenes and over-acting. Luckily, it does not cross the line between fun and stupidity. Some of the monsters and special effects are funny. After a while of letting them soak in, you start to take them more seriously. The story of a magic box that unleashes demons sent to torture people is a good concept, as people believe real ouija boards really do unleash evil spirits. A playboy manages to escape the clutches after blood from his lover's husband drops on his remains, letting him slowly come back to life. The whole concept is very interesting, but as an 80s horror movie, you can't expect greatness. Like Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street, the main killer kicks ass. Pinhead (played by Doug Bradley) does not make any kills (he lets his goons and death instruments do the work), but he is as scary as Jason and Freddy. Also like the two other movies mentioned, the style is 100% 80s. All that was missing was headbands, Michael Jackson, and Miami Vice. Other than that, you get the feel of the decade with the hair styles, general looks of people and general 80s film look. The general 80s film look is good, which is probably what sets it apart from the other movies. I'm giving it a 9 for being fun and memorable.

HR is like that and there are many reasons for it. This film can't be and no one has even really dared try copying. No one had the guts to do it. The horror genre was in the midst of its slasher film era when Clive Barker decided to adapt to the screen his 1986 book The Hellbound Heart. The stories style didn't fit at all with the trend of the movies coming out at the time. Amongst Freddy's, Jason's and Michael Myers's antics Hellraiser hit the movies that knew no humor and no irony. With precise and merciless effectiveness it showed the viewers what a real horror, filled with monstrosity and terror is like. In an unknown country in North Africa Frank Cotton buys an antique puzzle box. Back at his house in England, he solves it, gets skewered by hooks and demons called Cenobites appear. Everyone's favorite Pinhead makes everything disappear so when Frank's brother Larry Cotton (Andrew Robinson) in with his second wife, Julia Cotton (Clare Higgins) won't know Frank died. Larry cuts his hand on a nail and Frank uses this blood as nourishment to partially regenerate his body. Later, Frank (Oliver Smith) convinces Julia to help restore him to his full physical form. Its Barker's first feature direction it could best be described as an S&M love story wrapped in a horror, with sexual frustration and family tragedy in its center. There is the constant dissonance of pleasure and pain. The Cenobites aren't the enemy here yet, they're just doing their thing &#x96; which is unstoppable and not over-emoted and in your face but damn scary with their creepy appearance and cause you barely know anything about them, so they represent the fear of the unknown. The real evil of course is man desires, sex, murder. It's one of the most gut churning love triangles ever to be brought to screen and the participants are perfect at self-destructing. Special mention must be made of Christopher Young's music. Barker himself said that Young brought the most to the film out of all the crew and listening to his music you really can't disagree with that assessment. Just like the writer-director he went against the grain and unlike films of the time he didn't have synthesizers instead he got a huge ass orchestra and made dark, beautiful, Gothic music that was at once creepy and strangely uplifting. And you'd be hard pressed to find something similar. With all its afore mentioned virtues Hellraiser wouldn't be half as strong without the fantastic effects that is enjoyable by today's standards too. The legendary mask-maker and fx guy Bob Keen had a bunch of opportunities to excel in this film and it just elevates him to a whole other level that he had a laughable million dollar budget to pull it off. But the best horror of the 80s in opposition to a lot of its counterparts today and then wasn't born from money but from excitement, will and creativity.

The plot revolves around a guy named Frank who wants extreme pleasure in his live and comes across a person that claims a mystical box can provide that. When he messes with the box it sends him to some sort of freakish dimensional hell and gets tortured by these monsters called the cenobites. His unfaithful wife has a relationship with some other guy. However Frank manages to escape, but as a zombie form and in order to get to his human form back he needs to consume other humans. So when he manages to come across his wife, he convinces her to kill people so he can consume them. And the daughter of the guy she is having a relationship behind her husbands back tries to investigate what is going on and finds something way more than her suspicions were. This is actually a graphic and gratuitous movie that doesn't rely on CGI, but more on props seeing how this flick was made in the 80's. The special effects with the props and design isn't that bad and is actually comes off more creepy than some other horror movies that use a lot of CGI. Even for a horror movie that is from the 80's it has it's shock factor mainly because of the visuals from the mind of Clive Barker. A lot of people claim the first two Hellraiser movies are the ones that are worth seeing for people that like horror movies. And I guess I can see why, because the build up which has symbolism of indulging in pleasure (although the build up may come off as kinda slow at times) and mystery with the freakish and creepy visuals makes this one stand out when it comes to the horror genre. Even if the build up is a bit slow like I said, but for a movie from the 80's I can tell why it had the capability to scare the crap out of the viewers.

Unfortunately for them, Larry's sadistic brother Frank (Sean Chapman) has just escaped from Hell and is hiding out in their attic. Julia previously had an adulterous affair with Frank, and eventually goes upstairs and finds him as a skinless and vulnerable zombie. Frank needs to feed on human flesh in order to regenerate and become whole again, so Julia agrees to lure unsuspecting men up into the attic to become Frank's lunch. After this goes on for a while, Larry's daughter Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) comes to visit and accidentally discovers what Julia and her undead uncle have been doing. She also discovers the puzzle box - a mystical device with the ability to open doors to other dimensions or planes of existence. She steals the box from Frank and flees, unaware of the power it contains. After collapsing and waking up in a hospital, Kirsty accidentally solves the puzzle box and summons the Cenobites - four demonic beings from another realm that are obsessed with sadism and torture. When the Cenobites are informed that Frank has escaped their clutches, they are less than pleased. Time to raise some hell! Where Clive Baker (who directed this movie and wrote the book it was based on) gets his ideas, I will never know, but the man is a creative genius and master of the horror genre. This is one of the most unique and original movies I have ever seen with some of the most interesting creature designs as well. Pinhead the Cenobite leader, brilliantly played by Doug Bradley, quickly became a popular horror icon and star of the series that followed. Bradley made the part his own and will always be the one and only true Pinhead to me. But as great a character as he is, I prefer him to play a background role like he does in this film. It's just better that way. All the other actors here do a great job as well, except for Robert Hines (who plays the pointless character of Kirsty's boyfriend Steve) who really has no business being in the movie at all as he brings nothing to the story whatsoever. Sean Chapman in particular owns as the S&M obsessed Frank. He plays a great antagonist whose actions set in motion the events of the movie. Aside from having a very compelling and intricate story, this movie has some of the best visuals I've ever seen as well. The numerous glimpses of Hell (which we see more of in the sequels) are simply superb as well as the monster makeup of the various creatures that inhabit it. I've never seen Lucifer's Pad depicted in such a vivid and imaginative way. I could go on and on about how this movie lives up to its reputation as one of the greatest horror films of all time but I'll end this review buy saying that anyone who enjoys fantasy films with great characters and special effects should check this one out.

This was nice and ominous. Later, in a private place of his choosing, Cotton manipulates the cube, opening it up, and gets a visitation that he may or may not have expected.We jump forward in time. A couple unlocks an 'old homestead' which has been empty for some interval, and has the associated musty smell. We're in the UK, and the people entering are Larry and Julia, a middle class white couple. It's been empty for close to a decade. Larry is Frank's brother; the house belonged to their mother. Larry supposed that Frank needed a place to hang out, or lie low, perhaps. There is a lot of twisted religious art left behind, which Larry intends to sell off.Larry and Julia have moved from Brooklyn (Larry is American) back to England, where Larry has landed a good job and Julia should be more at home. Larry suggests Kirsty have a look at the place. Julia seems to have reservations, and she finds pictures of her being intimate with Frank. Larry and Kirsty (Larry's daughter) talk on the phone. He's not happy about her getting a job; she's not happy about living with Dad and Julia.So, in 13 minutes, we've got all sorts of things that could go wrong. Demonic influences, marital infidelity, teen-aged rebelliousness, and a cuckolded husband who has been doing a slow-boil for who knows how long. Let's not forget rising damp, insect infestation, and other vermin leftover from Frank's stay in the house. Then there are the movers who are trying to hit on both Julia and Kirsty. Great moving day all around. Just to add some straight up pain, Larry cuts his hand badly while helping the movers. His fallen blood awakens something, to the notice of the viewers, but not the characters, who scoot off to hospital.Just to add to the mix, Frank shows up. Well, something that claims to be Frank, anyway. The hideous half-formed creature asks Julia to provide sacrifices so that his return can be complete. Larry's blood brought him just so far, but he needs more to make a full recovery to being the old Frank. Julia decides to provide 'Frank' what he wants.The rest of the film is about the rather harsh consequences of that decision.Does anyone survive? -----Scores------Cinematography 7/10 Netflix showed this in 43 aspect, even though the film was recorded in 1.85; this always means visual content has been deleted.

It might be easily dismissed as a just another disgusting, gory cycle of cinematic oblivion if I weren't forced to admit that it tells a story that I found interesting. That's not to say that it tells it well, or that this is even a good movie, it's only to say that it is mounted on an idea that I found mildly intriguing. That's good news, in a way, when you consider that most films in this splatter genre are so null and void that while you're watching it you find your mind wandering to other things besides the movie. This movie is only slightly better than that.Hellraiser begins with a box, a metal Rubick's Cube-looking device that, when turned a certain way, apparently opens a portal to a dimension not a million miles removed from something that might be mistaken for Hell. As the movie opens, it claims one poor soul, named Frank (Sean Chapman), who has his flesh and bones ripped apart by hooks and chains and will spend the rest of the movie trying to get them all back together.What follows are some spoilers. So be warned. Enter Larry and Julia Cotton (Andrew Robinson and Clare Higgins), a couple whose troubled marriage is held together only by mutual tolerance. In the corner of this unhappiness is Kirsty (Ashley Laurence), Larry's daughter by his late wife. They buy a house that was once Larry's childhood home. Larry is Frank's brother, and unknown to him, the brother's remains are hidden somewhere in a room on the house's third floor. Unknown to Larry, Julia and Frank use to be lovers. When Larry cuts himself by accident one day, his bloods seeps through the floorboards and the gelatinous remains of Frank begin writhing around.For reason that I am unable to explain, Frank needs Julia to bring home fresh victims so that he can . . . somehow use their bodies to reform himself. Every time she brings home a new man, Frank's body becomes more and more reconstructed. I missed how this works, exactly. Is he stitching flesh back on? Is he ingesting the flesh? Is there some transference of psychic energy and flesh? I'm not sure how it works. Either way, Frank's condition is tied to the metal puzzle box, and there's some business with some leather-clad demonic punk rockers from Nether Regions who want Frank to pay for escaping their capture.As I say, the story is intriguing. The movie was written and directed by novelist Clive Barker and it plays very much like a story from one of his books. Yet, it fails o a basic level. This is one of those horror movies in which all the characters are basically slow learners, especially Larry who never catches on that his brother's flayed and bloody corpse is living in a room upstairs. This house is not exactly a sprawling mansion. And doesn't Frank's corpse give off an odor?

Though a more serious and discriminating fan than myself would have found it silly, I found even the lesser movies amusing on one level or another. Toward the mid-80's, the slasher genre kind of died a slow, horrible death. The idea that sex would doom you to death from any one of an assortment of lame killers in masks of all sorts (a clown mask, a gas mask, a hockey mask, etc) was replaced by fears of aliens landing from outer space (Critters, The Borrower, The Blob remake, Killer Klowns from Outer Space, etc) and weird mutant monsters of all shapes and sizes (Child's Play, Pumpkinhead, Scarecrows, Leviathan, Neon Maniacs, etc). Then we got the devil scared back into us with religious horror films such as 1987's The Believers, 1984's Children of the Corn, 1988's The Seventh Sign. And this s&m horror film about the sexualized, purgatory-like dimension between heaven and hell where cursed people dare to travel to test their endurance for an eternity of pleasurable suffering.Hellraiser, from gay cult-author Clive Barker, was a low budget horror film with sophisticated performances by the seductive, vampy, goddess-like Clare Higgins playing the glamorously bitchy 'Wicked Stepmother'-from-hell, and Sean Champman, her bad-boy lover who transforms into the elegant and brooding Oliver Smith (covered in unbearably repulsive makeup and goop). The plot is interesting. Because it's a series of ideas arranged in a way that suggests the writer has no idea why he's writing this way. I haven't read any of his stories, but I'm told they're pretty loopy. And that he often writes without knowing the meaning behind what he's writing. The primary lead character is Julia, the stepmother. She has had an affair with her stuffy husband Larry's rebellious, black-sheep brother Frank, and as the movie begins, she and Larry and moving back into his old family home. Which is also the place Frank last inhabited before he mysteriously disappeared. Skipping ahead, Frank returns but isn't human, and as he hides in the disgusting, dirty attic, he guilts the sexually frustrated Julia into cruising bars for lonely men to bring back to the house for Frank to feed on, using their blood to grow him new human body parts.I wish I knew what was interesting about that. If anything, I applaud the film's ability to make any of that seem sophisticated. But it does. The dialogue is decadent and often deceivingly poetic. Which kind of presents a problem, whenever a character has to curse or say something crude- it doesn't feel authentic. Until those moments, the movie is using the gruesome special effects and monster designs to do the job of being crude so that the movie doesn't have to make the characters stupid. Not that it matters much. When the score's strings start to swell and row, you're just waiting to see what happens next. It's very arresting. One of my absolute favorites is the very long and breath-taking scene where we meet the secondary lead character Kirsty - Ashley Laurence - and follow her as she walks all the way from an industrial harbor port to the upstairs in her father's house, on a gloriously breezy and overcast day. This movie wants to be quite ugly and gritty, but there are a lot of moments that defy that ambition and look damn good! Another favorite of mine is the gorgeous outdoor bar where Julia meets her first victim. Yet another is a brief sequence with Kirsty and her father in an oriental restaurant. For a low budget movie, the quality of the lighting, cinematography, location shooting, etc, truly look impeccable.Inevitably, a film like this would have a few flaws. This is Barker's best film but the flaws are first-time-director mistakes. Like, a completely out-of-place closeup of Kirsty looking very intensely upset being edited into the sequence of her walking up to her father's house. That's out of place because she is smiling in every other shot of her in this sequence. That is unquestionably the biggest error in the movie. The others are simple awkward slip-ups that could have been smoothed out with alternate takes. The film slides around all throughout in terms of how professional it feels. It's more plot-driven than just a gorefest, so professionalism is definitely an important consideration. The ending feels a little long in the tooth. Did anyone else think it was silly for Kirsty to have to open and shut the puzzle box every time she had to send one of the Cenobites away? That got on my nerves like repetitive actions can for some viewers. Also, there are some images that just aren't all fans might crack them up to be. Especially, that ugly big orange worm. God that damn thing was ugly. Why was it there at all? This isn't Labyrinth. Also, the design of the twist-face corpse was too much like those from John Carpenter's The Thing. And... why does it look like those rats are eating pureed bone fragments?Overall though, the film's a winner. It makes you think. Gives you many images and situations you've never seen before in the genre. And manages to have a real grace to the way it combines the more classy elements - like Barker's amazing monologues for Frank and Pinhead, the famous lead Cenobite character (and would go on to become a legend in the horror hall of fame) - with the grotesque (for the most part). There's a lot of talent and flair for photography and mood (in spite of the pretty amateur special effects). The music mainly works, though it's a bit overly orchestral and formal for my tastes. Could have experimented a bit more. Much like writer Clive, I imagine, with this storyline. But, I'll let him take care of his own inner demons.

The effect is not ruined by over done dialogue, inappropriate score or bad acting.

He seeks to kill people in order to return to his full human form and escape hell's lackey's, the cenobites, led by the terrifying Pinhead.Doug Bradley, playing Pinhead as he would through countless sequels, brings a calm menace to the character in the very few scenes he is in. The fact that we rarely see Pinhead, and never for long periods, makes him all the more terrifying.The kills in this one are not creative or fun, they're simple and disturbing, but not so over the top as to make the film enjoyable.There is nudity, there are sex scenes and graphic violence, but this is the best example of 80s horror you will find.

It's nearly perfect and done without the pansy CGI of today. This was done in good old fashioned handcraft and it's beautifully horrible. The actors don't have to do much (and they don't) to make their figures fascinating since all the leading characters are unsurpassed in their complexity, at least in the horror genre. They are all pretty crazy and somewhat insane but the way they interact is utterly believable and keeps the viewer on the edge. The cinematic look of HELLRAISER sent more chills down my spine than any other horror flick so far. The Cenobites and their hound are impressive designs and pieces of art themselves. Pinhead definitely deserves his place next to Freddy, Jason and Michael. His iconic look hasn't been surpassed by another creature in my knowledge and this is a rare thing in the age of the guy with a long knife and a messed-up family. HELLRAISER is great.

Fourtanately we get mediocre from most of the cast with 2 exceptionsFrank, who is played convincingly enough by Sean Chapman, with all the malice and ambition required. Douge Bradley shines above all as the legendary Pinhead, who has minimal screen time. He portrays Pinhead perfectly, as the menacing yet fair and quite intelligent being who is only out to do his job.One thing that I love about the film is how the story plays out like a Shakespserian tragedy, with the fatal flaw of a main character setting him out to achieve a goal, which ultimately sends him and those around him spiraling into self destruction(sure Frank's not someone of high class like most Shakespearian tragedies but it's close enough) Frank's fatal flaw is his desire. His desire to experience new sensations caused him to be brought down to hell. His desire to come back caused him to enlist Julia in murdering people so he can absorb their blood, with the Cenobites ultimately coming back for him and taking him down as Frank gives the famous line Jesus Wept The effects seem dated compare to today but they still get the job done. Considering the budget for this film, they did one hell of a job, although the effects at the end are less them impressive(though no fault of Clive's, like I said low budget) This movie also uses a highly fitting musical score. Notice the music during Frank's resurrection scene. It's not a soundtrack that will go down in cinematic history like Psycho or Halloween but it is a cut above the majority of horror films. This film does have it's share of tense and scary moments. The film does a pretty good job of creating tension, and the presence of the Cenobites alone is pretty damn intimidating.So if you're in the mood for something that rises above most, hellraiser is a good pick.9/10 "},{"Title":"A tale of pleasure, pain, angels and demons","Date":"17 March 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" I have always had a certain sympathy for horror genre. Since little, i get some scary fun with that horrible fictitious characters. Of course, i heard about Hellraiser. When i watch that man with needles (Or something like that) in his face, i was scared. In this time i have never seen the original movie, in T.V always give to me the sequels... not more. At least, after 5 or 6 years i found Clive Barker's Hellraiser (Believe me, found a title like that in DVD that have subtitles is not so easy as it seems). Since little i think that was just other ridiculous movie that only that wants is just show ugly scenes to win some good cash. I was so wrong. Clive Barjer's Hellraiser is not only one of the best horror movies that i have ever seen (Other movies that i love of this genre are too Brian De Palma's Carrie based on Stephen King first book and Murnau's first Bram Stocker classic Dracula adaptation Nosferatu), Hellraiser is at the same time, one of the best movies that i have ever seen.This amazing tale told us the key to the most infamous human desires through a rare box. This box is a kind of puzzle, that, when it is resolved, open a gate to a labyrinth of confusions, where is the horrible and recognizable Cenobites (Oundstaning scary characters). This creatures are that angels to some, demons for others that give to any human been that open the box the most horrible and deeper sensorial experience, in all the meanings pleasure and pain. One of the Cotton's family solves the mystery of the box, as you know, he disappear for that special facts. His brother,Larry, and his wife (Who is the lover of the missing guy) goes to the same old house. Larry's daughter, Kirsty goes sometimes to visit her dad. But in the house something is happening, in the attic appears strange sounds. Julia, Larry's wife, discover something horrible and macabre but she will unite with it. Kirsty suspect something... suddenly, she discover not capable for your eyes. Clive Barker's Hellraiser is not a regular horror movie. Is an excellent movie. The story, based in a short story by Clive, is so captable that takes you to that hell and makes you feel the real horror in your own flesh, like if the Cenobites take you to a sensorial experience. The characters are good defined and the performances are great (Ashley Laurence is outstanding as Kirsty). I really believe the effects and the music is so catching... i just have to say this This movie is awesome.Clive Barker's Hellraiser is a marvelous horror fantasy that makes you think (Few horror movies do that.. just think that this one and The Exorcist). The human been have desires, not of spirit or soul, desires of flesh, of feel that carnal desire. And the human been can even sold his soul for feel that pleasure. Clive Barker's Hellraiser is a tale of angels and demons, pleasure and pain, sadomasochism, monsters, death and desire. Is good horror movie with an awesome message. I must repeat it... what horror movie do that? *Sorry for the mistakes. Well, if there any.

The plot concerns an unfaithful wife, Julie (Clare Higgins), who is visited by the zombie of her husband, Larry's (Andrew Robinson) brother, Frank - a lustful man whom she had a love affair with before his death. Unfortunately, Frank has a connection with the Cenobites, a group of demons from hell that he escaped from and has been chased by ever since. Frank also holds a lamented puzzle box that can release them onto earth. Frank sends Julia to kill random men so he can gain more life , and she willfully does so. But when Kirsty (Ashley Laurence), Larry's daughter (and Frank's niece) realizes what is happening, she finds herself caught up in a bloody battle between the forces of good and evil, to try and save herself from the demons.One of the strangest horror films of the 1980s, Hellraiser is unlike any movie you've ever seen or likely will see. Written and directed by Clive Barker, who helmed the story that the 1992 classic Candyman was based on, brings a refreshing and genuinely frightening story to the screen. I can confidently say that the plot to this film is so much unlike any other I've yet to see, which makes it a very unique and pleasant surprise. The storyline takes a while to get going and builds up during the first 45 minutes or so, and then after that all hell breaks loose (literally) and things start to get really insane. Sex is a main theme in the plot, and has a strange connection with death, which is a consistent element in the story. It's a little strange but it works. To go along with the splendidly original story are some very memorable (and very spooky) scenes, and some unforgettable lines. The performances were good, everyone involved was above average I'd say. Nowhere near perfect but far from horrible. Ashley Laurence is the main heroine and she plays her debut role surprisingly well. Clare Higgins and Andrew Robinson are the estranged husband and wife, and are also very good. Doug Bradley plays his now-legendary role as the leader of the Cenobite demons, and was later crowned the name Pinhead, which has become a notorious horror icon (along with the puzzle cube). His role is terrifying and he plays it with a cold, calm demeanor which adds to the villain's scariness. The makeup effects in this film were quite amazing, all of the demons are unique and very creepy looking. Another notable thing is the gore in the film. Most of the gore isn't a result of killings, but of transformations from rotting corpses, and the grisly monster/creatures from hell (oh, and let's not forget those hooks on chains!). The CGI effects are a little dated, but this wasn't a major problem. The movie ends in a satisfying way, leaving it open-ended for the many sequels that followed.Overall, Hellraiser is a weird and wonderful thriller that is perhaps one of the most original horror movies of the decade. Not only did it bring a breath of fresh air in the genre, but it spawned one of the most infamous horror villains of all time. Clive Barker is really an imaginary genius, seeing his works can easily verify that. I definitely recommended this movie to horror fans, it's one of those classic 'must-sees'. Granted, it's not a movie for everybody (some people may not enjoy it, and I suppose that's understandable), but it's a film that you've got to see it at least once. 9/10.

This is much rather a film that will make you think as well as cringe, and leave you asking just who the real monsters of the film are. And trust me, you won't be able to answer that one easily.Hellraiser delves into the realms of sadomasochistic horror, set against the backdrop of a suburban household, inter-weaved with a subplot of adultery and revenge from beyond the grave! (excuse the cliché...) Hellraiser's tone is exceedingly dark, with virtually no relief from an overwhelming sense of oppression present throughout the entirety of the film. If anything the poor quality of film used enhances the dark and brooding atmosphere, with the majority of the budget obviously spent on the costumes and effects of the protagonists of the film. There is one instance of exceedingly poor special effects, with one of the monsters seeming more comical than scary, but one has to forgive this as Hellraiser was made almost 20 years ago and what may have seemed cutting edge at that time is sadly less than impressive in the modern day.Hellraiser provides a truly chilling experience, with the viewer left feeling uncomfortable throughout. Whilst it may not appeal to some viewers of more slasher style films, this is what a true horror film is supposed to be disturbing, unsettling, and taking the attitude of less is more when it comes to violence and death. "},{"Title":"Hellraiser","Date":"11 December 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Made in 1987 by Clive Barker, was a low-budget British horror film. Based on a novel (also written by Clive Barker) The Hellbound Heart. It explores the aspects of sadomasochism, and the mystery of a puzzle box that when opened release demons that torture mortal souls for all eternity. As well as exploring the turmoil of a family whose lives soon go from average and mundane to a nightmare of murder betrayal, revenge, and punishment.The story is centered around a golden puzzle box said to be the doorway to an unfathomable world of erotic pleasure that would last all of eternity. To be delivered to it's opener by the cenobites considered to be angels who will deliver you your wildest dreams.The story describes the downfall of a man named Frank Cotton. Who upon finding the legendary puzzle box discovers the pleasures spoke of were to be of horrible sadomasochistic torture by creatures called cenobites. A group of horribly mutilated humanoid figures bound in leather with distinguishing deformations, such as those of Pinhead whose mutilation consists of pins that have been hammered through his flesh into his skull in a grid pattern and six open wounds on his lower torso seen through his leather outfit.The story continues some time after Frank's disappearance, during which, his brother Larry and family move into the old desolate house. Then a few drops of blood from a small accident causes Frank's body to begin regenerating from the residue left of him under the floor boards. His heart reforms and begins pulsing and the bone and organs of his body return, but he lacks skin and flesh. Julia, who was his lover while engaged to Frank's brother Larry, succumbs to Frank's pleas, and agrees to help him. A broad portion of the story centers on the sexual tensions between Frank and Julia and Frank's ability to use his previous relationship with Julia to persuade her to murder for his rejuvenation with promises he'll be with her. She begins seducing men at singles bars, then luring them up back to the house up to the desolate attic room where Frank waits to drain them, so it provide the blood needed for his body to regenerate, thus allowing his soul to escape the cenobites.In this review I won't give away the ending. I'm not so cruel as to deny you the pleasure of seeing the film for yourself. As a person who loves the magic behind film I can honestly give my approval on this movie which stands above all other horror films made during the 1980's.I feel this film is powerful in describing what we fear. I also believe it does something other movies of the genre cannot. What it does is create a world too horrible to imagine beyond the dry concept of death. In Hellraiser it goes beyond death which would be a good thing compared to the endless torture you'd face at the hands of the cenobites. And in my opinion serves as a more intellectual film than many others of the same genre.Enjoy the film. "},{"Title":"The Horror Movie That Re-Made Horror","Date":"2 November 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Clive Barker took horror to another level with his early novels and the movie Hellraiser. Philosophically similar in some sense to the work of Anne Rice, Barker's rhetoric puts the horror inside of us, inside very human characters. Their flaws which in turn lead to their horrific outcomes are very human. This is a very different notion than most of the work of Stephen King who often portrays the common man going up against the dark forces like in The Stand, Salem's Lot, and IT. However, the closest works of King's to Barker's are probably Carrie and The Shining where the evil lurks not without but within.What lurks inside Frank Cotton is almost as terrifying as the cenobites he encounters. I only wish Barker had explored this aspect of Frank's character a bit further in the film, showing the lengths at which the character goes to obtain the pleasure box.The original story, the short novel The Hellbound Heart, speaks of Cotton's addiction to pleasure at all costs, going from town-to-town, country-to-country, continent-to-continent to satisfy his constant appetite. Whenever he finds pleasure, mostly through sex, he says It's never enough. The theme of addiction is ever-present in the story. Frank hears rumors of a box that will open up another dimension in which inhabit a race of beings that know all about ultimate pleasure. When Frank finally acquires and opens the puzzle box after having gone over many lands and seas to find the box and relinquishing a small fortune to obtain it, he is terribly disappointed. The creatures an altogether different definition of pleasure, one which is summoned by opening Les Marchand's Box, the so-called cenobites, have inextricably linked to pain and suffering. The excruciating pain then followed by an end to the pain is what makes the pleasure so sweet. The cenobites cobble up Frank from his bedroom and take him to a horror-filled alternate dimension.The wife of Frank's brother, Claire, wants to re-experience the wonderful sex she had with Frank.They had a brief affair before she married his brother, Larry (Rory in the novel), who is opposite in almost every way to Frank. Larry has repressed sexuality and a revulsion to blood.Through a freak accident in which Larry's blood spills onto the floor of the bedroom, the same place that Frank had opened the puzzle-box, part of Frank begins to reemerge, the bedroom giving birth, and the blood being a doorway for Frank. Claire discovers him and agrees to give him more blood to bring him back. Claire becomes the other monster of the story as she brings victims to the half-made Frank who uses their blood to become whole again after the cenobites un-sewed him the first time around. Frank's addiction led him to his original ripping and Claire's addiction to Frank leads to her horrific actions.A much more disturbing and darker look at human nature. Some have called Clive Barker the writer of cerebral horror.

I was in awe of the Leader from the moment I saw him, predatory grace incarnate. He was beautiful. The lack of skin is a key point, illustrating the ultimate truth about each soul. Nothing can be hidden here, the only illusions are those of the ego. EXPOSURE is the greatest terror most people can fathom, but it is the function of Hell and its keepers to torment each soul with its own faults and wasted potential. This is done without malice, at least from the Cenobites. They go about their work with a lack of compassion that is truly the only mercy they can show. Theirs is not a task of punishment, it is one of refinement.The heart of this film is not fear of the Cenobites, it comes from the question it asks each of us... would you have the will to refuse Them when They came for you?

He needs more victims, and Julia will do anything for Frank, so she brings him victims. Let's not forget Kirsty, who loves her daddy and despises Julia, and oh, those cenobites are here too, don't worry about them. They're kind of mad that Frank escaped them.Openers Hellraiser, and the series in general, is a very strange animal. The original Hellraiser is certainly one of the more bizarre films you will ever see. Maybe not in execution but the concepts and characters created originally by Clive Barker(and have taken on a life of their own due to the many sequels, comic books and overall cult status Pinhead has achieved) are certainly out there. Hellraiser was definitely a film that marked me. Instead of the slasher films I was used to, Hellraiser was a different world and a complete different type of horror. It's fantasy horror. You can see the fantasy elements in this movie at it's core. I think maybe Clive Barker really wants to be a fantasy writer more than anything, but he just has a knack for horror in general.The Good Ashley Laurence looks like she's been through hell at the end of the movie. Which she has but I mean she acts the part. The acting is *not* a strong factor of these movies, and so if you get a competent actress it will make it worth it, and Ashley does a good job as Kirsty in that regard. The movie's fantastical nature was toned down here due to budget(but they more than make up for it in Hellraiser 2) so they focus on makeup. The makeup effects are astounding. We have a skinless man, and of course the cenobites which are in full costume and have various effects. Pinhead, whose name is self explanatory. The female one with her throat ripped open and stretched out. Butterball, the fat one with his eyes sewn shut. And the Chatterer...eyes are also shut and whose mouth is stretched so far open that whenever he tries to talk he just..well..chatters. I can't even imagine the hard work that went into it and so I applaud them. The story too I liked. Not necessarily the script but the story is very original and bizarre. Doug Bradley is good as Pinhead for the first time here, not phoning it in like he would be in later sequels and not hamming it up like he would before that. We'll tear your soul apart is still a classic line.The Bad The ending felt like it was attached with a staple gun at the last second. After a dark dreary movie, which is essentially a very sick and twisted love story, we get a light show for the obligatory big finish, and the budget didn't allow it so we get a really *bad* light show. Not to mention how are we supposed to believe that a girl can send back all the demons of hell in the span of not even ten minutes? Really felt like they were given the wrap it up gesture and had to hurry to finish the movie. Also, the acting from everyone else is VERY melodramatic. Claire Higgins in particular. No more I can't bear it! Who talks like that? She sounded like she belonged on some soap opera or something. The script and acting are not this films strong suit.The Ugly This movie contains an intense final 30 minutes filled with blood, violence, and more blood..did I mention the blood? Skinless bodies, hammer blows to the head, bleeding walls, bodies being ripped apart, skin tearing, knife wounds... this is such a bloody bloody film. Gorehounds will love it. Those with weak stomachs may not.Final Verdict Don't go into this expecting cinematic masterpiece. Hellraiser is what it is, a horror film about masochists, demons and puzzle boxes that open the door to hell. And on that note it does a decent, if very flawed, job of it.Rating ***1/2 of ***** "},{"Title":"Still tearing souls apart twenty years later...","Date":"26 August 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" The first time I saw Hellraiser was on a crummy VHS tape, I was about twelve years old, and I had more of an appreciation for violence or gruesome special effects than I did storytelling. If you had asked me then, I would have said that Hellraiser was a bore, a collection of great gore surrounded by seemingly interminable exposition. As a man, however, I am able to appreciate its subtlety. This does not mean Hellraiser is a great, brilliant film, but it does mean that it has a lot more merit than what Ebert gives it credit for. That said, just as I have said with countless other films, if you have only seen Hellraiser on VHS, you have not really seen it at all. This is one film where seeing the points at which steel enters flesh, or ink marks skin, is really appreciated. Anchor Bay have outdone themselves on the DVD, which is especially mesmerising to behold on a Plasma TV of a hundred and six centimetres. Stephen King was right. Clive Barker is the future of horror, with all the usual clichés and stupid devices nowhere to be seen.Based upon Barker's novella The Hellbound Heart, Hellraiser is a story of how far we will go in order to achieve satisfaction, and what it will cost us if we go too far. Unfortunately, the first error Clive makes is in the lack of detail he goes into regarding Frank's first encounter with the cenobites. Granted, he was limited to a very small budget, but The Hellbound Heart's description of the moment when Frank realises his grevious mistake is far more satsifying in the end. Not that the first images we see of the cenobites aren't satisfying in themselves. Barker's decision to join the opening sequences to the rest of the film with the classic image of Doug Bradley in full makeup resetting the box was one of the smartest made during the 1980s. As Frank is driving his sister-in-law to murder men so that he might rebuild himself, one perfectly understands his motivations for this truly despicable behaviour. And therein lies the true key to building a compelling antagonist. We are repelled by Frank because we know we might do the same in his position.Fortunately, Ashley Laurence gives us a protagonist we can like. During the opening scenes, we cannot see her as anything but an ordinary twenty-something girl. Towards the end of the film, we see an ordinary twenty-something girl who suddenly finds herself in a very messed-up situation. Her attempts to bargain with the cenobites are almost painful to watch, and for a good reason. She never breaks character, even in the most uncomfortable situations, which makes it all the more a shame that she only seemed to resurface for a sequel. Sean Chapman and Andrew Robinson round out the circle as the brothers around whom the novella revolved. While the good brother as Andrew portrays him is never quite developed enough to make one care about his fate, Sean develops Frank so well that one almost wishes he could escape the fate that he has brought upon himself. When Andrew suddenly takes the walk on his character's brother's wild side, such is the nuances of the acting on display that one immediately realises what has happened, and is even shocked by it in spite of how telegraphed it is.Which brings me to the real star of the film. Doug Bradley, a friend of Barker's from high school plays and the like if you listen to the audio commentary, was offered his choice of roles on the production. Had he not been offered the cenobite with the most lines, he has more or less said, he would have chosen the part played instead by Andrew Robinson. And that would have been a waste of such great talent. Where other film killers were either mute or too prone to mistaking themselves for comedians, Bradley gives us a monster who is so matter-of-fact. When he indulges in humour, it becomes refreshing due to how dry it is. You have to really be listening to him to get it, thus the film rewards the audience for paying attention. Bradley has since gone on to perform in a seemingly inordinate amount of sequels, including the masterful second episode, but he is never in finer form than is the case here. When he tells Ashley Laurence's character that he will tear her soul apart if she is trying to pull a fast one, the words ring in the memory like being told one has cancer.Special mention must be made of the various effects. Whilst the special visual effects, particularly at the end of the film, are strictly low-fi, the makeup effects throughout the rest of the film are so brilliant they make the film almost as much as the performances of Laurence, Chapman, Robinson, and Bradley. Sure, the pillar of wood with the chains and bodyparts nailed to it was a bit silly, but you will never notice it amidst all the suffering the rest of the film displays to us. When Andrew Robison improvised the line Jesus wept, I just had to laugh. Take it from someone who has regularly suffered the psychological equivalent of what goes on in Hellraiser Clive Barker really knows how to put his characters through pain. And that is the great advantage that the first two Hellraiser films have over those that have followed. The audience cares enough about the characters that what becomes of them is truly satisfying to watch. It could even be argued that everyone in the film, from Frank to Julia to the myriad of strangers, gets exactly what they deserve.For these reasons, I gave Hellraiser an eight out of ten. If nothing else, it is a great example of what can be done on the cheap.

I know i've read more books than most my age, however I just never got around to reading Clive Barker's original work until way after I had seen the movie. I however really enjoyed the movie, it's gory and very surreal. That isn't even describing how demented and mean spirited it is. I remember seeing this in a crowded theater when I was 16, it was always interesting to watch gory stuff in a suburbanized theater because people often times walked out and many people walked out with pale faces. It's an experience I remember due to the fact that my usual experiences with city theaters had people walking out as if nothing happened, I saw Ten To Midnight in my local Chicago theater and nobody was phased. At the time Hellraiser was the new standard in gore and it took just one year to be outdone. (It's equally enjoyable sequel) and so forth, I don't think you'll ever see a more skin crawling film. This is not for those who find hooks getting ripped into flesh hard to stomach. For me and to this day I find this great macabre entertainment.

Not very often does the writer of the book direct the movie, and even just for that reason this may be an interesting film to watch because you feel like it's a first generation experience. Now onto the details. The movie is extremely gory, so don't have a full stomach. Also if you get nightmares easily I'd suggest watching it in the middle of the day as opposed to late at night for the first time because you might have trouble getting that out of your head. I will say young Ashley Laurence completely makes Hellraiser, 3 times more watchable then with a lack of her. She's by far the best actress/actor on the film with the rest ranging from average to a little cheesy. Don't let that turn you off because the film has other good things, mainly the special effects are quite effective (for an 80's movie you probably won't notice the technology setback). For example the sequence when the body comes up out of the floorboards and starts getting muscle and bone slowly; this movie has it's memorable horror moments for sure. I.e. the Cenobites and the director's portrayal of them as enjoying the suffering of others in a place without rules or 'limits' to what pain you can endure at their expense. People get ripped apart by chains wieled from these creatures minds, body parts and organs hang from wooden racks that spin and through giblets on the walls. Also this movie has some added disgust showing complete adultery and hinting at maybe worse things - something this movie continually does throughout. Another memorable moment is when Ashely's character opens the box that opens these gates to Hell (the cenobites) -the walls heat up, light filters through cracks in the woodwork of the walls, and a hallway opens from a fissure in the wall. As she walks into this new hallway (WHY?) it looks like something out of an underground prison, and baby screams can be heard. About 30 ft. into the hall something is just there when the camera goes there, it's a ugly 'hallway creature' that holds itself up with rear arms that is totally unnatural. Cheesy moments include flowers blooming on television sets to try to give some kind of mood/symbolism that doesn't work. Also Ashelys (basically the main character)father/mothers dull attempts to hide the truth from Ashley lead to a almost unbelievable distance between her and her parents....can't she tell that somethings up?? Good grief. and that happens a few times. Most emphasis is on her affair with her husbands brother Frank, and how he is resurrected from Hell by her killing men she meets in town. He basically uses their body to regenerate his...sound pretty? It ain't. and neither is this movie. Basically its designed to push what you're used to seeing in a horror movie. For that its a must see for any horror fan, but probably isn't watched by the general audience well.

Yet in the deeply conservative period of the mid to late eighties, horror's well ran bone-dry, as Hollywood proved unwilling, or unable, to break free of its own tired formulae, bombarding viewers with an endless succession of sequels and diminishing returns. In a little under ten years there were four inferior follow-ups to 'A Nightmare on Elm Street', a staggering seven sequels to 'Friday the 13th' - and every other horror director seemed to be just going through the motions, slavishly mimicking these long-expired franchises for all that they were (or, more to the point, were not) worth.Yet just when the world of horror had become oversaturated with moronically buff teen victims, unstoppable heavy-breathing slashers and undead paedophiles delivering sub-Schwarzenegger wisecracks, a young English director named Clive Barker came right out of left field to remind filmgoers what a scary place hell can be when presented with imagination and originality. 'Hellraiser', based on Barker's own novel 'The Hellbound Heart', was so many things at once - a haunted house movie, a sadomasochistic fairytale, a family tragedy, a gory piece of Gothic - and yet it was like no other film of its decade, and touched a raw nerve with its all-new horror mythology, its elegant narrative construction, and its unabashedly dark unpleasantness. In short, it was - and remains - a classic, able to get under the skin not least because for over half the film one of the main characters has none of his own.Larry (Andrew Robinson) moves back into the old family house with his frosty wife Julia (Clare Higgins) after his wayward brother Frank (Sean Chapman) has once again disappeared from the scene - but far from merely skipping town, this time Frank has opened the gates of hell with a mysterious box, and his soul has been taken to the outer limits of pleasure and pain. After Larry's hand is injured while moving furniture, a splash of his blood revives what remains of Frank's body, buried under the floorboards. Desperate to reform himself bodily (if not morally) with more blood, the skeletal Frank enlists the help of Julia, with whom he had once had a passionate affair, and she is soon enticing strangers into the house for him to suck dry. Yet when Frank's attention is attracted by Larry's pretty daughter Kirsty (Ashley Laurence), she is forced to cut a dangerous deal with the infernal Cenobites, once-human guardians who want their escaped ward back and will raise hell to get him.Full of images that instantly entered the nightmares of the collective unconscious - the puzzle box that opens a path to eternally exquisite torment, Frank's body rebuilding itself sinew by bloody sinew, and the Cenobites themselves with their radically pierced and surgically altered bodies (including their iconic and eloquent leader, who would be dubbed 'Pinhead' in the film's many sequels) - 'Hellraiser' is a horror film not to be missed, even if some may find the exotic pleasures which it offers to be cruel torture.PluspointsEverything Negative pointsEhm? to short?

Fully decked out in the whole S&M regalia, the demons (which include Pinhead and Chatterer, among others), are truly terrifying. There are minor differences that were lost when the novel was adapted to the screen, such as the moving of the Kirsty character from close family friend to daughter.

It still holds up well, aside from some cheesy opticals. What makes it so rich is the layers of the plot, its partly a well-acted chamber play, not unlike Bergman, dysfunctional family relations, and a surreal Lynchian nightmare. There is a motivation to the gore and violence here, thanks to the rich characters (many become fully fleshed out so to speak). The limited settings enhance the claustrophobia, still, larger vistas are hinted at and wisely left to the imagination. The cenobites have to be the most striking horror characters created for a modern film, and the first encounter with Pinhead is unforgettable. Back to Bergman, upon watching Cries and Whispers, I noticed some parallels, a dying relative trapped in a room, Erland Josephsons as the doctor, his menacing entrance and cold, ice stare reminiscent of Pinhead. Chris Youngs score is very effective throughout, my favorite moment are the aggressive pounding rhythms heard when Julias murdering spree gathers momentum. Its a pity that the sequels have failed to deliver like this one, although Hellbound have one or two striking moments.

Fresh out of high school and over 18, I can see any film I wanted without parental guidance. The horror genre was at it's peak. Filmmakers were finding new ways to gross out the audience. Novelist Clive Barker directed one of the most disturbing horror films around, Hellraiser. Disturbing not for its gross out scenes, but for it's subject matter.Larry and Julia Cotton (Andrew Robinson and Clare Higgins)move into an old house once occupied by Larry's deadbeat brother, Frank. They appear the happy couple, but are far from it. Julia is an ice queen, and only one man thawed her outFrank. Her and Frank had an affair many years back and she still wishes to be with him. She gets her wish in spades when Frank returns, although not looking too good.Seems that Frank likes to dabble into REALLY dark things. His hobby led him to a mysterious puzzle box. As they say, curiosity killed the cat. In this case, Frank's curiosity literally gets him hooked and skinned, sending him to the depths of hell, where the creatures called the Cenobites (The leader who will be forever known as Pinhead for obvious reasons)delight in bringing pain and pleasure to those who call them. Frank manages to escape, brought back by the blood of his brother (Due to an accident while moving). Unfortunately, not all of him is back. Frank appears to Julia and tells her that they can be together if she helps him. This would require bringing Frank human sacrifices that he can drain.2 things put a dent in their plans Larry's daughter, Kirsty (Ashley Laurence), who grows suspicious of Julia's behavior, and the Cenobites, who are none too pleased at Frank's escape.There is A LOT of blood and gore in the film, but the underlying theme of necrophilia is even MORE disturbing than the gore. After all, Julia is doing all of this to be with her dead lover (And notice what she does when she's with skinned Frank. CREEPY!).But it's the Cenobites that steal the show, especially Pinhead (Doug Bradley, in a role that has gained a huge cult following).

The atmosphere in the film is very dark, it is not exactly scary, but the viewer feels uneasy during the whole movie. The film has his low points,though. It is quite slow-moving and if you have read the book (like me), boring. Also the images in Hellraiser are too gruesome, I think. I have watched many horror-movies, but nothing I have seen, including The Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies matches the nastiness of Hellraiser. I think that sometimes there were needless cruelty shown.

Sold the world over as a horror film, this for me falls more into the not generally recognized genre of macabre fantasy for that is really what this is.So genre taken care of, lets deal with the movie itself. Can anyone who reads this say that they have seen an '80's horror film' that was more original than Hellraiser?? If they can, can they tell me what it is because if it exists, I ain't never found it. What you have in Hellraiser is an excellent storyline, peppered with the most brilliantly chilling lines such as No tears, please. It's a waste of good suffering from Pinhead (credited quite low down as Lead Cenobite) and I thought I'd gone to the limits. I hadn't. The Cenobites gave me an experience beyond limits... pain and pleasure, indivisible from Frank.I think one of the things that mark this above any of the contemporary horrors of the time is that it was adapted from Clive Barker's novella, by Clive Barker (note that the best of the Steven King adaptations were adapted by King himself) and also by directing it himself, Barker made sure to retain as much control over the script and final product as possible thus ensuring some other writer or director didn't end up producing their take on Clive's story, instead what we get is Clive's own, slightly disturbing, vision.The sequels were on the whole (with the exception of Hellbound Hellraiser 2 and Hellraiser 3 Hell On Earth), an uninspired, unimaginative and unbelievable pile of unmitigated tat (ok, I know what you're thinking, but I enjoyed no.3) but the first still stands as a true classic of it's time and type that is still to be bettered. Whilst I have yet to find the horror film that scares me, this is certainly one of the most visually stunning (despite the obviously low low budget) and imaginative horror films this reviewer has had the pleasure of seeing.

"},{"Title":"Gross, not too scary","Date":"3 October 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  If Stephen King is the most recognized horror author of recent decades, then Clive Barker could arguably be pulling up to second place. A British author, playwright and artist, Barker endeavored to add screenwriter and director to his resume with his 1987 horror film debut, Hellraiser. While it has undoubtedly integrated itself into horror pop culture with the character of Pinhead, the film itself is not the strongest piece of horror cinema ever created, largely owing it's shortcomings to Barker's unusual predilections for gore and his not quite robust ability as screenwriter.Based on Barker's novella The Hellbound Heart, Hellraiser isn't the textbook example of strong plotting. It opens in a market somewhere in the continent of Asia (I guess) where an individual is purchasing a wooden puzzle box from a street vendor. The individual is named Frank Cotton (Sean Chapman), and he returns to his family home to uncover the mysteries of the puzzle box in a strange séance of sorts. The outcome is that the puzzle box shoots chains from it's enclosures and rips Frank to pieces, and apparently has opened a doorway to Hell (maybe). Hell features creatures that dress-up like they had a bad accident on the way to an S & M party, known as Cenobites, that seem to take great joy in ripping people limb from limb. Mind you, I am guessing at a lot of this. Some time after Frank buys himself a one-way ticket to eternal damnation, his brother Larry (Andrew Robinson) moves back into the family home with his wife Julia (Claire Higgins) and is visited by his daughter from his first marriage Kirsty (Ashley Laurence). Julia is obviously not supremely happy in her marriage, and upon discovering Frank had recently lived in the house, it brings back memories of an affair she had with Frank shortly before her marriage to Larry, but while still engaged. Shortly thereafter, Larry sustains a cut on his hand and bleeds on the floor of the room that Frank was in when he opened the puzzle box, and somehow, this blood is used by Frank to rebuild himself into some shadowy form of himself, sans skin and most of his muscle mass. Julia discovers Frank and, apparently still hot for him, agrees to help him by picking up men in random bars, bringing them to house while Larry is away at work and killing them so Frank can harvest their blood to rebuild himself. Kirsty discovers this fact and manages to grab the puzzle box during a confrontation with Frank and opens it to Hell, where she makes a deal with the Cenobites to save her soul by offering up Frank's, whom they are not aware escaped from them (they apparently need a better inventory system).Hellraiser requires that viewers take a lot of things for granted. Barker had not apparently mastered the art of ensuring his audience is not supremely confused by events on screen at the time he wrote this screenplay (or it was butchered in editing). How exactly does Frank rebuild himself from nothing? Is there some kind of essence in the room, has he not gone entirely to Hell? Why are the Cenobites not aware of his ability to escape?If all it takes is some bleeding on a floor where the person was last in corporeal form, then you would think that victims are escaping left and right. What exactly is this puzzle box and why are people seeking it out? They are apparently not aware of what awaits them when they solve it.For those who have weak constitutions, Hellraiser is not recommended viewing. It is full of some of the more grotesque imagery in a film I have seen (although it pales in comparison to audacious scenes that were crafted for it's sequel, Hellbound Hellraiser II). This film is wall to wall gore and violence, so if that bothers you, time to give Hellraiser a pass. Hellraiser makes it appear that Barker is fascinated by violent bloody imagery, but that doesn't make the film scary, merely grotesque. There is very little suspense in Hellraiser, it mostly exists to show us some freaky stuff and move on. Some of Barker's imagery is creepy at times, I give him that, but for the most part, what we see on screen isn't exactly frightening.Hellraiser isn't a total loss, but it's hardly a masterpiece and it would take a few films before Barker would begin crafting some stronger screenplays. Hellraiser is good if you like make-up effects gone mad or sadomasochistic imagery, but for a good scare, there is not much to see here.

I can't believe my parents took me to see it! The acting is decent, but a little wooden. Some of the special effects are pretty silly, like the yellow and blue bolts of electricity (they were borderline-bad back in 1987), but they remain effective and aren't too distracting as some effects in the third Hellraiser installment. I remember, even at eleven, that the scariest parts of the film weren't with the cenobytes, but the scenes with Clare Higgins who plays Kirsty's wicked stepmother, Julia. She's cold, distant, calculating, sly, and evil. Uncle Frank is also menacing, but I wouldn't say he is as evil as Julia, but the incestuous feelings toward Kirsty are enough to creep anyone out. I also liked the fact that the films is not quite all-American or British. It makes the movie more accessible to both countries, while keeping that 'this-might-be-anywhere' feeling (like Willy Wonka--where the hell did that take place?).

These evil beings who would walk around killing people, have stared in many films each in series which have slowly gone downhill with time (to such a degree that Freddy's last, and Jason's previous two were both more satires of themselves than anything). The same is true of the Cenobites in the Hellraiser trilogy. Whilst this first film was dark and creepy, with a decent plot, the following five were awful.In the very first Hellraiser movie, we are introduced to Frank Cotton (Sean Chapman or Oliver Smith depending upon state of decomposition) who, upon messing with a magical little golden box, is tortured by the Cenobites, masters of pleasure and pain. Desperate to escape, Frank is given his chance by a freak accident suffered by his brother Larry (Andrew Robinson). Returned to the real world in a half reconstructed state, Frank convinces Larry's wife (and Frank's lover) Julia (Clare Higgins) to help him to recover and escape once and for all from the Cenobites.Whilst Hellraiser is an original idea, it's by no means the best horror film ever. Compared with more extreme horror's like recent classic The Ring (2002) and the influx of recent zombie movies, Hellraiser is mild and irrelevant. This does not make it a bad film however. This film is a well constructed, gruesome little piece which screws with your mind and is likely to give a lot of people nightmares. Clive Barker is arguably in the top three horror writers of all time (the others being Wes Craven and Stephen King perhaps) and his other major series, Candyman (1992) is another brilliant well constructed idea. If anything, Barker is a thinking man's horror film creator.Perhaps the best thing about Hellraiser compared with most alternative horror series is that it requires a decent performance. Whilst Doug Bradley is the only consistent actor throughout the series (playing head Cenobite Pinhead), in this first piece, Andrew Robinson and Clare Higgins perform well as Larry and Julia Cotton, Higgins in particular showing how Julia's character changes as she flexes her morals more and more for Frank.To summarise, Hellraiser is not quite your typical horror movie. Adding an element of thinking to a gore filled piece, Barker has created a well thought out film. It's not the best, personally my preference is for the early Friday The 13th movies, but that doesn't make it a bad film. For a film which is gut renching, yet simultaneously makes you think, watch Hellraiser. If however, you just want blood and obscure deaths, your better off with a different series.

They definitely wouldn't be as scary if they had been in more scenes, and because they don't show up much, there is a mystery behind them, something that the later installments of most horror franchises don't have (Nightmare on Elm St. comes to mind). The Cenobites should just stay in the background of the story. The FX in this movie are great to. Barker is good at just disgusting the viewer, and the FX in this movie do just that.

I mean, how many other movies do you know that are rated R in which you can see skinned people walking around, people being pierced and torn apart by hooks and demons which look like they are coming from some SM studio? But beware of the German version. it is cut down so that you can sometimes hardly imagine what's happening, and that destroys much of the athmosphere of this movie. The only thing that isn't very good is the pacing of the movie. The book was straight in that way, but the movie lacks something of a structure.

Maybe the stars were in alignment, maybe it was the bull market of the eighties with it's abundance of money, but this is another of these gems.Hellraiser is one of British horror writer Clive Barker's most successfully adapted novels. Spawning many sequels, the first is still the best. The story is simple enough. Larry and Julia, and Larry's daughter Kirsty (Ashley Lauren) move to a new home in London's Docklands, once frequented by Larry's estranged brother Frank. Frank, an intrepid searcher of forbidden pleasures, has mysteriously disappeared, but left behind a puzzle box with strange powers, that can move on their own. The box summons a strange breed of creatures, the Cenobites, who are demons to some, angels to others (yes, you heard it here first), that once had the same desires as Frank had. Which is as far as I'll go.The Cenobites are a big part of what makes this movie. Pinhead, the freak in charge, has some great lines. There is a bloated guy, a woman who had her throat slit and goes around talking with gargling noises... Watch out for Mac Fleetwood as old Satan himself.Even if the movie can get slowed down in places, it's worth it. The biggest disappointments are the sequels, none of which explore the really interesting creatures, the Cenobites themselves, which is a shame. As Clive Barker is a literate person, the theme of this movie is of course not only the creatures, but the horror that springs from the mind of man him (and her-) self.

The violence and gore is amazingly graphic, not just for its time.  Clive Barker definitely created some great visuals.  One of my minor criticisms deals with the story, which is good enough to hold my interest, but could've been a little richer.  And the characters are for the most part underdeveloped.  I understand horror films are more about entertainment than aesthetics, but I like to be able to connect with the characters in the story, so I can better feel their terror.  The acting ranges from good to awful.  Doug Bradley is outstanding as Pinhead, but he doesn't have much screen time, despite the fact that his face is plastered across the video cover.  But the performance that really stood out was by Claire Higgins, who is delightfully fiendish.  I always appreciate it when an actor treats a role in a horror movie in the same respect as that of a Shakesperean drama, and that was definitely the case with Bradley and Higgins--both brilliant English character actors.  The performances by Andrew Robinson and Ashley Laurence are uneven.  Laurence expresses sufficient terror with her facial expressions, and also happens to be very attractive, but some of her verbal outbursts are a little cheesy.  The actor who plays Ashley's boyfriend is extremely wooden and nearly lifeless, but luckily he only has a small role.  Not surprisingly, Clive said in the commentary that he wasn't happy with his part.

For a movie which was born during the heart of the mpaa's horror gore crackdown of the 80's, it was surprizingly (and refreshingly may I add) shocking. The skin was cheaply fake, the Pinhead screentime short; but seeing Frank/Larry Cotton (Robinson) groan out, Jeeeeesssssuuuussss Weeeeeepttt and give a sadistic chuckle before being literally ripped apart by Pinhead and his cetobite gang, gave me a chill I hadn't experianced since The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.Others may remember Barker's vision come to life in Jihad magazine- cult trash that lasted no more then a month, in which dozens of cetobite freaks gathered, plotting ever on to unleash hell on earth.

Part 2 is ok as 80's sequals go, and if you must have more Pinhead, don't skip this one either. Three doesn't do the first film justice. The fourth is a little better, keeping the box as a key point to the Legacy, which is shattered by the fifth. It is amazing to me how a director dared to touch the Hellraiser series after this mess, whithout fear of never directing again. It is so bad, commenting on it's details would be a waste of time. Put simply, it was the Halloween 3 of the Hellraiser saga. Shun it, and forget it. The sixth was better, but was no treat. If another sequal is dug up from the annels of hell, it better be the last. Evil NEVER dies, but fan's interest does. But who knows? If Jason can escape hell to reach the depths of deep space to murder on, or Halloween can be ressurected again... and again, then Pinhead can be dug up, repainted, and refilmed.

Those are the three words I would use to describe this masterpiece of dark horror by Clive Barker, the man who Stephen King calls `the future of horror'.Those of a faint heart should keep away but those of us who can stand intense and horrific gore and gut-churning effects will be rewarded by a film that explores the very depths of human depravity. This isn't a movie about monsters, about a puzzle box or even about a guy with nails in his head; its about debauchery, incest and sex. The story, at its core, is a family saga and the puzzle box, named the Lament Configuration, is only a tool.When Frank Cotton escapes the clutches of the Cenobites, explorers in pleasure and pain, he seeks the help of his brothers wife (and his ex-lover) to bring him the blood he needs to be brought back to life. She uses sex to entice men to the house where she feeds them to Frank so that she can be with him again, towards the end of the film she sleeps with him whilst he wears his brothers skin! It is the relationships that drive this film.Still, the hero is around in the form of Kirsty Cotton, son of Larry and niece to Frank. She doesn't trust Julia, her step-mother which leads her to uncover Frank and meet the Cenobites. She gives the audience someone to root for and is well portrayed by Ashley Lawrence; her chemistry with Andrew Robinson as her father is readily apparent.The Cenobites, when they do appear, have a strong and terrifying image and the Lead Cenobite (later named Pinhead) is the ultimate in father figures; stern and to the point. The Cenobites aren't evil, they simply do there job and this is where the fear comes from; they are completely indifferent to you or your pleas.At the end of the day this is a well directed, excellently acted and all round intelligent horror film. 10 / 10.

What was accomplished with such a modest budget is simply amazing, especially considering the limited experience Clive Barker had as a filmmaker.However the movie lacked the eloquence of the novella which probably explains why some were disappointed at the relative lack of sophistication.  If you had read the book first you may have well expected Mr. Barker to work his poetic style of writing into the screenplay more than he did.Still, compared to its' eighties slasher flick peers, Hellraiser is high brow with an intelligent story and a surreal presentation reminiscient of Phantasm.I think the worst mistake was dubbing the actor who played Frank Cotton.  Even if his accent is a little hard to understand, I can't imagine it being less effective than the obnoxiously wooden Godzilla-esque dub over that replaced Sean Chapman's natural voice.  I would love to see the British version someday as this unfortunately added an element of cheap cheese to the film that wouldn't otherwise be present.Frankendubbed aside, I found the performances to be adequate while mostly falling short of great.  Some of the dialogue definitely left something to be desired.  It's also somewhat silly that the toughest and smartest person of anyone in the story is a 17 year old girl.  Not that I have a problem with an intelligent 17 year old girl being the heroine, but she was the only one with any common sense.  She all but slapped the Cenobites around while crafty evil Frank was at their mercy.My only other complaint is how poorly the death of Julia was handled.  Not only did she die way too fast, but she looked long dead right afterwards.  Perhaps it could be viewed as an artistic device considering the surreal nature of the film, but it definitely stands out.As much as I elaborated on the flaws, there was far more that I loved about Hellraiser.  Without the Cenobites this story would have been extremely creepy but they added to it an extra entertaining dimension of terror.  What was explained more clearly in the book was that Frank was convinced he was opening Pandora's box rather than Pinhead's.  It was well enough left out as even someone as foolish as Frank wouldn't have sought what he ended up getting.The Cenobites brilliantly represented the unknown as horrific sadomasochistic demons from beyond.  It's a shame that sequels were made, but it's a bigger shame that those who made them failed to realize that the less we know about these demons the more we fear them.There was just so much to be afraid of in this movie- numerous hideous Cenobites, Frank, Julia, and even a creepy evil eyed insect ingesting bum that Larry's daughter frequently encountered.  They all should have known better than to mess with Kristy!I loved the special effects!  Be sure your stomach is sitting well with you before you watch as Hellraiser is relentlessly gory.  At the same time, it manages to effectively convey the theme of the book- mankind's obsessions with pleasure.  I highly recommend both the film and the book for any fans of horror.

As I recall, another reviewer boldly stated that these plot elements are strong enough to sustain their own film, without the supernatural aspects. He may be right.It is amazing how effortlessly the everyday drama of the Cotton household blends with the fantastic situations that soon crop up. Much of the credit for this belongs to Clare Higgins, whose honest reaction to the situation makes the devilish goings-on more credible. How would people truly react when confronted with the otherworldly? Hellraiser may provide the answer.Kudos, too, to the technical work, aptly done despite budget constraints. Frank's resurrection scene makes astonishing use of old-fashioned special-effects technology. It would not have been nearly as effective with CGI. The Cenobite designs are excellent, as is the makeup work done for skinless Frank. Notice that the violence, as graphic as it is, never seems exploitive. It's just *there,* unlike other 1980's horror films where the object is just to show as much gore as possible within time and budget.Hellraiser has held up very well over the last fifteen years. True, the pacing is somewhat uneven, and some of the ending seems pretty throwaway. Nonetheless, the film has offered us some of the most truly horrifying, bizarre images in fright cinema.*** (out of ****)Released by New World Pictures  "},{"Title":"A near-masterpiece of eighties horror","Date":"27 March 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  During the eighties, cinema's two most prominent categories were teen movies and slasher/horror movies. Of the latter category, many were derivative, formulaic clones of other, better horror movies, quickly exhausting the genre with their tepidness, which is why it was such a relief to have viewed Hellraiser (although the glut of sequels tarnished the original's image), a film which must be remembered as a near-masterpiece of eighties horror.Hellraiser depicts the story of a man and his wife, Julia and Larry, whom upon moving into an old house, discover a horrifying secret lying within its walls Larry's half brother Frank, whom also happens to be Julia's former lover. Having lost his earthly form to a quartet of demonic beings, the Cenobites (Pinhead, Butterball, The Female Cenobite, and the Chatterer), he is resurrected by a drop of blood upon the floor. He eventually forces Julia to bring human sacrifices to the house so that he may complete his body, but the Cenobites are not happy about this... As you can see, the unique storyline behind Hellraiser is one of the many aspects I enjoy it so in addition to the actors (namely Doug Bradley Pinhead) and Clive Barker's direction, this film being both his debut and the theatrical adaptation of his novel, the Hellbound Heart. He provides fantastically morbid and gothic imagery that really accentuates the mood of the film. The eerie score, provided by Christopher Young in accompaniment to the direction, acting, and storyline really crafts quite a wondrous cinematic gem. Unfortunately however, Hellraiser is not without flaws, although these complaints are minor. The pace can at times be lethargic (I admit to checking my DVD timer once) the gore somewhat too graphic (Why must I be squeamish?), and it begins to lose momentum during its second half, yet I still adore Hellraiser for providing eighties horror with a fresh slate. I definitely recommend this film.Grade A-  "}{"Title":"A Classic Piece of Horror","Date":"19 January 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  I first Saw this Movie when I Was a Kid, and Didn't Think too much of It.

Because the Plot is Kind of Hard to Get Used to and Understand. But once you do, You'll Love It!!!First off, I Don't think it Would right for Someone to Not be Informed on How Gory this Film Really is. It is Brutal. This is not the Kind of Stuff that will make you Want to Puke, but Rather the Stuff that Could make you loose your Hunger. For Some People that's Bad, to others it's Good. To Me, Some of the Gore Could have went. I own the Rated Version, and It would not be Something to Watch with Grandma, so I Can Imagine what the Unrated Version must be Like!But The Gore Still Does not Ruin how Much of a Masterpiece this Film Really is. The Originality, Setting, and Plot already make it a Film that Most People will Enjoy. The Sequels are Superb too! Just as Good, if not better, Than the First! Anyway, This Film is Really Spectacular. Many of the Scenes Made me Just not want to Talk. I was Frozen.Clive Barker, as You May Already Know, has Given us Classics such as Candy Man. He Delivers the Same type of Stuff Found in Hell Raiser and Candy Man in All of His Films. Very Scary. The Ending Should make you Wish for 15 Sequels to Come out.        10 out of 10People who Enjoyed this Film Might like Puppet Master, Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, A, Friday the 13th, Child's Play, as Well as Other Horror Movie Classics.

Next to The Exorcist, its one of the few that really scare me. Hellraiser tells the story of a very selfish & greedy good-for-nothing name Frank Cotton. This man has got to be the sorriest person ever! He squanders his inheritance & even has an affair with his brother's wife on the eve of the wedding. Frank is not only bored with life in general but he's also a very malevolent person which makes him a prime candidate for the Cenobites. When he opens the puzzle box, he gets more than he bargained for. Upon his brother moving back into the family house, when blood is accidently spilled into the floor, Frank comes back. He & his sister-in-law start killing men for their bodies to bring Frank back so he can deceive the Cenobites. This film is good for several reasons. For starters the plot & the special effects which will blow you away! Its also a thinking man's horror film. I believe this film has a moral in it as well as a social commentary on how we as humans think we can control everything in & of this world. Just about everyone in this story pays a price for what they do. For anyone that loves gore, atmosphere, good acting & writing as well eye-popping special effects, this one has all these elements & then some.

Clive Barker was and potentially still is the future of horror, and Hellraiser was a true horror masterpiece.  The story is about a woman who seduces men and kills them to bring her lover back to life.  The catch  her lover opened a puzzlebox known as the Lament Configuration, which calls upon the Cenobites to bring him to hell and push the limits of pain and pleasure.  When her stepdaughter Kirsty learns about the dead uncle walking around in the attic, Kirsty runs away with the puzzlebox that Frank owns, and when she opens the box, the Cenobites come for young Kirsty.  Kirsty is able to cut a deal with Pinhead and company, a deal that says she will bring her uncle Frank back to the Cenobites instead of taking her.  This leads to a thrilling ending that opens the door for a sequel.Clive Barker, who also wrote the story that eventually became Candyman, creates a film that gives A Nightmare On Elm Street a run for its money.  Barker's Pinhead also becomes one of the most recognizable villains in horror, just like Nightmare's Freddy Krueger, only Pinhead and the Hellraiser series aren't as commercially successful.  Hellraiser also features a great heroine character in Kirsty Cotton, played extremely well by Ashley Laurence.  She is discarded later in the series, however, which was what Nightmare did to its top heroine, Nancy Thompson, who was played masterfully by Heather Langenkamp.  The two films have several similarities, and while Hellraiser will never get the recognition it deserves, it turns out to be one of the best horror flicks in modern history.Hellraiser earns ***1/2 out of ****.

Great film.","Date":"13 November 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  Good Points This lovely little stroll down Horror Lane sports something that incredibly few movies seem to possess...an original story line.  Sit back and let this one burst into your brain 'cause you're not in Kansas anymore, kiddies.  Hellraiser is so amazingly horrific it defies comparison. And of course, having come from the mind of the Master of Horror himself, Clive Barker, it's no wonder that, in spite of its none-too-extensive budget, the original Hellraiser is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen.  It's strength lies in its compelling story and juicy makeup effects. The Angel of Death has nothing on the Cenobites.  One look at these twisted demons will send sane people scampering under their beds.Bad Points After each bad point of Hellraiser, there's an understood ...but that's because they didn't have the money to do better. Masterpiece of Horror that it is, admittedly the acting and directing are nothing special, which is a shame because, in the hands of a truly talented director, Hellraiser could have been magnificent.  I believe the only cracks in the movie are budget-related with one exception Who was the idiot who came up with the idea of dubbing over the voice of Sean Chapman (Frank Cotton) with some other dude in an attempt to give him a darker presence? Some people may not notice, but watch closely when he talks.  His mouth doesn't quite match up with the words in a few places.  And if that doesn't convince you, rent something else with Chapman in it and you'll see that Cotton's voice is not Chapman's.  How utterly cheesy.Bottom Line Regardless of a few smudges, Hellraiser is one of the few genuinely fantastic horror movies we poor mortals can hope to rent. Barker is a master storyteller and the filmmakers did a decent job of bringing his hellish vision to the big screen.

"},{"Title":"My quintessential horror movie","Date":"7 August 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  First, I think that this film is unique in that it blended strong gore elements that had been hitherto reserved to Italian splatter movies with a standard Hollywood-style overall appearance. Although from what I have gathered it is to be considered a low-budget movie, I think it doesn´t look like one, whereas Italian gore flicks of the late seventies/early eighties always had that laughable, cheesy look all over them, preferably topped by great disco music... Hellraiser is probably one of those movies they don´t make anymore, because normally you can´t have movies that signal they are sort of mainstream (as this movie does, in my opinion), but which then go beyond the limits of what an average audience considers to be normal. The sequel Hellbound is evem more extreme in this respect, I mean the non-edited X-rated version... Hellraiser 3 and 4 (both made in the nineties) are much tamer, I think, and the fifth part is said to be even worse in that respect.Hellraiser 1 also had to be edited in one part, where Julia´s first victim is originally seen to say Please, please,with blood pouring from his mouth, before receiving the final death blow... I guess that was too hardcore for an R-rating (my comments are based on an unrated version from the Netherlands, as nobody in his sane mind would dare to watch a German edited version of this film ;-))))))))) There are very few other examples of movies I know that fit into this mainstream quality with more than R-rated violence-category. The only other examples I know (apart from Hellbound) are the uncut versions of Re-Animator, Dead Pit and (from the Action genre) The Punisher, all of them made in the eighties... That said, I must also admit that I have a very intimate and personal relationship with this flick, because I had to wait several years after its release in order to be admitted to see it (again, German laws are much more severe in this respect than in the US). It was one of the first horror films I ever saw, and that´s why it stuck in my mind. I probably wouldn`t hardly notice this film if it was released today (I´m now 28 years old). The first impressions are usually the ones that have the strongest impact on you. For example, I was really a bit shocked to see that nowadays Ashley Laurence doesn`t look like she´s 20 anymore, Clive Barker has grown a beard,Christopher Young composed a wishy-washy soundtrack for Set It Off, and Doug Bradley is nearly fifty, although as Pinhead he looks good as ever (hee hee...). Therefore it´s pretty hard to swallow for me that another commentator remained completely unimpressed by Hellraiser... I also think that Andrew Robinson and Claire Higgins deliver top-notch performances that go far beyond anything you usually get in horror movies. Julia´s transformation from an insecure, sexually frustrated person you feel sorry for to ice-cold murderer is pretty convincing in that every person is born good but may turn evil under certain circumstances... These comments are rather personal and will probably confuse anyone who reads them, but I also want to add that, the way I see it, this film was part of a creative phase in Clive Barker´s life which also delivered the Books of Blood and the Damnation Game novel to the world. After that, he turned more esoteric, I am presently at pains to finish Imajica, which, I am sad to admit, features very artificial, unconvincing protagonists and is bluntly written (at least that`s what I think, okay?). But in the eighties, Clive, as you all know, was considered the future of horror, and rightly so in his novels from that time, and also in Hellraiser, you find that certain degree of sickness many people can`t cope with. Perhaps, this was really a historic phase in horror between the It all should take place in your imagination-era of, say, Alfred Hitchcock, and the boring, digitally polished stuff from the nineties and the new century (From Dusk till Dawn, Scream, oh geez, yaaaawn, but then again, I´m almost 30, ain`t I?). I´ll check out Hellraiser 5 at any reasonable chance I get, and I´m definitely looking forward to seeing Ashley Laurence again in Hellraiser 6, but, judging from the way the Hellraiser series has developed over the years, I fear the original feel cannot or will not be recaptured...

One could easily point the finger of blame at the Cenobites as well, yet they are just doing their job and have no evil intent.Indeed, at the heart of this film is an age old ethical question should we strive to be happy or to do what's right?

"},{"Title":"A Mixed Experience","Date":"12 October 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  I have conflicting emotions about the 1987 horror film, Hellraiser, based on British writer, Clive Barker's novella, The Hellbound Heart.  While the basic concept is fascinating -  involving unfortunate people who open puzzle boxes akin to a Pandora's Box From Hell, thereby unleashing a motley crew of demonic denizens called Cenobites to plague them - and the makeup and special effects being highly effective, if not horrific; the film's incoherent storyline and relentlessly grim atmosphere made viewing a somewhat mixed experience. Perhaps it was the film's utter lack of humor (recall Freddy Kruger's wit), pervading cynicism and sense of despair thatsubliminally discomforted me the most. Hellraiser is not a particularly frightening film, but it is an effectively gut-wrenching, gruesome one.  With a better script and a few deft strokes of levity, it might have become a genuine horror classic; nevertheless, in spite of it's shortcomings, it has managed to attract a dedicated cult following. Hellraiser's cult status, arose mainly due to it's outstanding character, Pinhead, the Head Cenobite (played superbly by Doug Bradley).  Pinhead is unspeakably cruel and takes great sadistic pleasure in tormenting his victims.  I even think that he might have a dual sadomasochistic element within him, as he too was once human and suffered the same torments, and seems to empathize with his victims in a perverse sort of way, i.e., he enjoys the scenario precisely because he can re-experience his own previous suffering vicariously, and at the same time, still relish the hellish pain he currently inflicts upon them!  Very twisted if true! The multiple pins or nails that protrude from his face and bald head are stark, grim reminders of the the agony he once endured. Hellraiser is not for the squeamish, or those who have depressive maladies - if any film conveys an unremitting picture of eternal gloom and doom, of suffering and damnation, it is this one. Paradoxically, Hellraiser is entertaining to the extent that it appeals to  perverse, sadomasochistic elements that lie deep within the bowels of human nature.  Gruesomely repulsive on one level, yet morbidly fascinating on another. Perhaps the redeeming value of Hellraiser is an educational one, that is, it presents atheists and other secularists who  discount traditional notions of Hellfire and Brimstone, with the distinct, thought-provoking possibility that a different, far more bizarre kind of Transdimensional Hell might exist.

This film is about a simple (or thought simple) puzzle box that Frank gets from a wierd man who we find out is some sort of guardian of this box or something but sells it to unleash the demons or just sells I guess.Thanks to Clive Barker we have a classic film with a very serious villain with no comic relief (but none is needed). Many people enjoy Pinhead's one liner's like We'll tear your soul apart and Oh please, no tears, it's a waste of good suffering! Pinhead also tends to enunciate most of his words or phrases.

Clive Barker directed this horror drama in 1987, and it caused an enormous commotion and polemic around the world, the critic got divided in terms of their view of the film some applauded the courage of the plot, others detested the film and it had its exhibition prohibited in some countries. But Hellraiser is not a common horror, stuffed with special effects and touching moments. It is a slow, difficult, bloody, grotesque and almost unbearable film, a horror thriller which goes acquiring psychological proportions, above all through a character, Júlia (Clare Higgins, a great English actress). She is, without a doubt, the star of the film, she is the main element of  Hellraiser  as a lacking and seductive woman, who will do anything to help Frank, her lover without skin. Júlia doesn't hesitate in killing men and offering them as food to Frank. Hellraiser is a film that is not recommended to sensitive people but with certainty it is one of the largest and best horror films, a small masterpiece! The characters are three-dimensional and really dramatic, and it is worth of note and very special the scene in which Frank, without skin and ugly, is hidden and looking at Júlia and his brother making love. Scenes as this one shows that Hellraiser, besides being a frightening work, is a film that talks about love and loss, is a film that explores the characters' psychological aspects, although it is exceeded in the violence.The merit of the film resides in the talented English actress Clare Higgins, who passes to the public the whole pain and despair of a woman who  will do anything to alleviate and ease the man she loves ...

Child's Play, Friday The 13th, Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street - The lot. What I got isn't exactly what I expected (although to be fair what CAN you expect from a premise like this) and out of all of them - This is my second favourite behind Halloween.The story - Years ago Frank gets a box that when he opens - it transports him to what some may consider to be Hell (although I don't think they ever really call it Hell, except in the title - I could be wrong). Some time later his brother, Larry moves in with his wife Julia and after cutting himself accidentally and bleeding on the floor in which Frank was transported - He is able to regenerate but he needs more blood before the Cenobites (Demons, basically) discover he has escaped. The only person who knows about it is Julia who seduces men and gets them killed while Larry is at work.Larry's daughter, Kirsty stumbles across it after Larry says Julia has been acting weird (I refer to it by first name terms because it's revealed Julia isn't Kirsty's mother) and she also unwittingly opens the box and the Cenobites emerge but Kirsty makes a deal with them, if she gives them Frank, they'll let her go.Well in terms of how this movie gets it's horror across, I have to say that while it does build suspense and to it's credit it does that extremely well there is also a lot of Cronenberg style imagery in it - the kind that's still gross and graphic even to this day and while I am not a fan of that genre I will say this method does actually work.For a standard horror movie it does have it's share of dumb moments but surprisingly the acting is very good (I'm almost contemplating to watch the sequels because of the cast members making a reappearance). I also like the lighting and cinematography as well as the visual effects. This stuff is made to be the stuff of nightmares and while in terms of creature design and other things like the gore the effect is good.If there is anything that I should tell people so they don't get let down (this isn't necessarily a complaint) it's that Pinhead has about 10 minutes of screen time. I mean when he's on screen he does have some pretty good screen presence but then again so do all the other monsters in this movie. In this movie at least I don't find Pinhead that memorable of a bad guy.In my personal opinion as far as horror movies go this one is definitely one that's worth it. In my opinion, it has some good acting, good directing and some actually rather impressive visuals. I'd say if you're a horror fan and haven't seen it already and you think this is your sort of thing - I'd say check it out.

Some time afterwards his brother Larry and his wife Julia move it; as they do so two things happen; Julia remembers the time many years before when she slept with Frank and Larry badly cuts his hand on a protruding nail&#x85; the blood hits the floor and Frank starts to come back together. Julia is shocked when she finds him; he looks hideous; he said he needs more blood if he is to fully recover and he must get it before the Cenobites realise he is missing; they are the creatures that tore him apart when he opened the box. Julia once promised she'd do anything for Frank and it turns out that includes killing for him! One day Frank's niece finds him and takes the box; will she be any safer than he was?This 1980s British horror shows its low budget fairly often but that doesn't matter as it is still pretty shocking; the effects may not be perfect but they look more real than CGI would have been if the film was made now. I had thought that the Cenobites would be the evil monsters here but the real evil is Frank; in fact the Cenobites get surprisingly little screen time compared to Frank. The only well known actor in this is the always reliable Andrew Robinson who does a good job as Larry, Ashley Laurence who plays his daughter is perhaps the more important character and the more interesting as she is the one who will ultimately confront the Cenobites and Frank. Over all I'd say this is a decent film and probably a much see for horror aficionados; just be warned it is pretty gruesome at times. "}{"Title":"Clive is a true student of the macabre.

He soon forces his former mistress to bring him his necessary human sacrifices to complete his body... but the Cenobites won't be happy about this.(Some major spoilers, just a warning)What's to say about Hellraiser that hasn't already been said? It's a magnificent piece of Horror cinema, and rarely will you see anything so wonderfully artsy. Unlike quite a few horror films, Hellraiser doesn't just throw in gore for the sake of gore, there's a point to it. It has some of the most gruesome scenes I've ever laid my eyes on; they still pack a punch today. What many people fail to realize is that Hellraiser is also a Gothic sort of love story between Julia and Frank. While it may not be very sympathetic, it's certainly tragic, and memorable. The lengths Julia goes to please him, and get him blood for his body clearly shows the adoration she has for him. And the tragic turn at the end it takes where Frank deceives her, is saddening to watch. Aside from Kirsty's idiotic boyfriend, the characters are all memorable. The flashback scenes involving Frank open the box are frightening and unforgettable. In the later sequels, the filmmakers made the mistake of making Pin Head into a pop-culture phenomenon like Freddy, only Pinhead isn't meant to be that way. Here he is in all his sadistic, creepy glory, and that's the way it should be.One of the things that really make Hellraiser is its incredible score. It's so profound, so powerful. I would really rank it as one of the most defining horror scores in history. They really don't make them like this anymore, nor would they take the chance on doing so. The rumored remake that is supposed to come about is a shame, but it will not tarnish Hellraiser's greatness.

It combines all of the perfect Horror elements, even adding in a love story. Performances. Andrew Robinson plays a nice guy for once, and he pulls it off. He's likable and ordinary, kudos to him for pulling it off. Claire Higgins gives a classic performance as Julia. She's intimidating, but also vulnerable. She isn't exactly the most sympathetic of characters, but her saddening eyes couldn't help but be endearing to me. Ashley Laurence, quite possibly the greatest horror heroine since Nancy of Nightmare on Elm Street, and Laurie of Halloween. She is the perfect protagonist for Pinhead, and they clashed beautifully with one another. She's strong willed, and very easy to like. Her legendary performance ranks up there with one of Horror's finest. Sean Chapman is creepily effective as Frank. His unforgettable voice also helps. Bottom line. Need I say more?

It makes sense from what I've been told about the background on Hellraiser, or the short story it's based on The Hellbound Heart. This movie, unlike the other slashers surround it (A Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, Halloween, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, just to name a few) wasn't supposed to be the Artist Soon to be Known as Pinhead.My guess is Barker wanted to go beyond Freddy, Jason, Michael, and Leatherface and make an intelligent horror story without relying on a wise-cracking, machete-wielding or babysit watcher to slice/dice the idiot cardboard teens. Fans later apparently missed the message and Pinhead came out of the shadows. (I'm just as guilty; I love the character of Pinhead. But, at least I still liked this origin movie the best of the Hellraiser series.)I concur with true Barker fans, especially after watching Red Dragon. It's not about Hannibal Lecter at all, though they splashed Anthony Hopkins all over it. Why? Well, fans wanted him, they wanted to increase box office and it would be his last stint as Hannibal the Cannibal. But, to me it ruined the movie as that's not what the source material intended. Heck, Hannibal was in, like, 4 pages out of 464!Alas, sticking with the film at hand Bravo. Aside from some cheesy lightening effects amongst some buck fifty door creatures &#x96; all probably due to the low budget, it was a highly effective up'd ante from the typical irony-laced/Twilight Zone fare with loads of plot twists, character development, background, suspense and a surprisingly large number of characters &#x96; all important &#x96; for such a small film.After Frank (Chapman) summons demons with a puzzle box (loved the box) and disappears, supposedly for good, his brother, Larry (Robinson) and sister-in-law, Julia (Higgins) move into his house. Immediately we're treated to Julia's extramarital affair with Frank in very spicy flashbacks.Meanwhile, Larry's trying to connect with his daughter, Kirsty (Laurence) who's (not very) oddly unfavorable of Julia. Meanwhile, after a deep cut, Larry splashes blood on the very floor of the very room his brother disappeared in and it gets sucked up and becomes an insect version of Frank. Meanwhile, Julia sees her chance of getting her ex-lover back and is willing to go the extra mile, for lack of a better term, to bring back Frank. Meanwhile, Kirsty investigates and inadvertently summons the very demons, or Cenobites, who are just as confused as she is on why they were called &#x96; generally they're called for pleasure through pain.There's more meanwhiles but I've probably spoiled enough. Suffice to say, it's a gory good time at psychological warfare between the innocent, the guilty and the deserving.And it's brutally gruesome. Not by today's standards, 23 years later, but I'm sure it was near the top of the list from 1987 backwards. One positive about the gore they didn't just rely on that, as most slashers/torture porn does since. This had one, uh, hell of a story here.That said, it wasn't perfect; there were a lot of plot holes including a quick wrap up in the last third that made Kirsty the thrown in heroine who could unconvincingly solve the puzzle in a few heartbeats and bargain these big baddies, lead by Pinhead. This is when all others, who actually know about them, actually call upon them, can't outmaneuver a flying hook. Also, they did a good job of introducing the Cenobites, but spent so little on them, it begged for a sequel, or more, to explore their storyline.Furthermore, it almost seemed like the creator, Barker, was anti-Christ as there were plenty to mock Jesus, even going as far as reference him in a quote from the Bible at the most inopportune time. But, in their defense, I think they did a good job of showing true evil, whether be it from the walking sadomasochistic demons or worse, man. It's hard to watch, but so was The Passion of the Christ. Both films show the true evil of men; they didn't sugar-coat/Sunday School what lies beneath our skins.It's definitely 1980s. It's a good start on the Pinhead legend. It's for gore fans or for people reminiscing about the 1980s horror franchises. And it's a recommended for a more thoughtful look at pure evil.

Is the writer/director, who also penned the novel(which I haven't read, so I can't make comparisons, though I understand that it follows it closely) and made up the concept, a sick, twisted human being? Probably, yes. If you don't think you can handle this movie, you're quite likely to be right. It's gruesome and graphic. But... and this is important... it is *not* phoned in, done by people who did not care whether or not it turned out good(and not just profitable), or one of the recent aptly-nicknamed torture porn flicks. This is rather well-done, and it's impressive that the dear Brit had such a handle on film-making, having only done two shorts before helming this. In addition to being disturbing and grotesque, this manages to provide a genuine, well-told story, an original idea, nicely developed characters, several of whom we can care about, and suspense that is expertly crafted. This is truly terrifying, and the last half-hour is to be experienced by anyone who considers themselves a fan of horror. Be it those based on atmosphere, or the more direct, visceral ones. With maybe one exception, there is not a single jump scare in this that does not pay off. The pacing is good. Acting is great, the performances are almost exclusively convincing. The tension of this is thick. There are immensely memorable lines of dialog in this. The special effects are mostly well-done, and tend to hold up well, even today.

Hellraiser celebrated its 20th anniversary last year, and it plays just as effectively now as it did in 1987. Not since George Romero used rural America as a playground for a flesh-eating zombie epidemic (in 1968's Night of the Living Dead) has the familiar facades of our suburban landscape been ripped apart with such invasive ferocity. The crux of Hellraiser is the American Dream gone wrong Larry Cotton (Andrew Robinson--Dirty Harry) and second wife Julia (Clare Higgins) move into an inherited house, where Larry's brother Frank (Sean Chapman) tinkered with a mysterious puzzle-box that unleashed a sadomasochistic group of beings called the Cenobites (led by Doug Bradley's iconic Pinhead); Julia had an illicit affair with Frank, and when Larry spills his blood on the attic floor, it resurrects the grotesque, skinless brother. Hellraiser adheres to an internal logic (think David Lynch with less pretension) all its own, and is quite inviting in its own awkward displacement--the performances are a little off-center (especially in reaction scenes), which only adds to the unconventional tone of the plot. And Barker's own affinity for torturous imagery (including some spectacularly gruesome scenes of hooks piercing flesh) acts as an extreme contrast to the facade of normality that quickly disappears from the Cotton household (the attic room becomes a abattoir for Frank's bloody sustenance); and the Cenobites become the confirmation of the family's transgressions, waking proof of a reckoning, and shatter the illusion of a soul's safety in an afterlife (in the film's most chilling line, Pinhead proclaims his ability to tear a person's soul apart). While some of the electronic special effects (and fashions) are pretty gnarly by today's standards, Hellraiser is fearless in what it does accomplish--a perversion of normalcy that does, indeed, raise hell. A must-see for all horror fans.

Among the books and movies, you can feel something larger in the background. It is a darker world that is encountered, with an unmentioned nightmarish beginning. The protagonist is not really the center point.Hellraiser starts off with a man named Frank, who obtains a mysterious puzzle box in the orient. As soon as he uses at his home in England, chains come out of it and hook into Frank. The room is changed, and otherworld dimension beings called Cenobites appear. They change the box back to it's original shape, and Franks body, a shredded mess, disappears.Frank's brother Larry moves in with his wife, Julia to the now abandoned house. While moving a mattress, he cuts his hand. He goes upstairs where his brothers soul resides, and the blood falls on the floor. The blood then revives Frank, who slowly through out the rest of the film, starts to recover his flesh and guts. But he needs blood to do that, lots of it. That's where Julia comes in.Larry's daughter, Kirsty, who becomes an important part of the plot, finds out what Julia is doing to supply blood to the skin-and-bones Frank unsuspecting men who are there for sex with her. She kills them one by one, and Frank uses their blood for nourishment. Larry, on the other hand, has no idea that this is going on.With a low budget, Hellraiser does a good job. The Cenobites, especially the main one Pinhead, are incredible looking baddies, with obvious sadomasochism tones. When they show up, you know there's no way out, and there is little one can do but feel the pain they are about to deliver. Andrew Robinson as Larry and Clare Higgins, Julia play the parts unusually well. But it is Oliver Smith, who plays the skeletal Frank (after death) that really is a horror house make up effect.There are some scenes that don't work, such as Kirsty running around the house with her boyfriend; his emotionless face shows no acting skill whatsoever. The story tells us nothing about the box, the origins of the Cenobites... so many questions left unanswered. Sure, these questions are briefly answered in the sequels, but none of them had the impact of this first entry.Still, Hellraiser remains a top choice for the horror selection, a classic that delivers the gore in a neat S&M suit with a good story to boot.

I thought the original was very interesting and creepy, though what I really liked most about it was the character of the middle-aged Julia (Clare Higgins) and how she is the instrument by which all the mayhem occurs. Higgins was the best thing about it, and it was a nice change of pace to see an adult becoming the center of the story rather than another typical teenager. The ironic thing is that the sinister Pinhead and his sillier fellow demons were the least interesting ingredients to me here; and their appearances were kept to a minimum for this first hurrah, which I think actually benefited the film. *** out of **** "},{"Title":"Not that great","Date":"16 November 2005","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Not That Good I wasn't really looking forward to seeing this film, expecting to see a cheesy violent and stupid old horror film.

He had been like this since he tried to back out of a deal with the Cenobites, a race of sadomasochistic demons led by Pinhead, who may or may not be the Devil.The concept is somewhat intriguing, but nothing (and I mean NOTHING) happens.  The movie is one big yawn with some decent splatter effects thrown in here and there to keep the audience awake.  Doug Bradley is effective as Pinhead, and Andrew Robinson does well in the lead role, but Barker's screenplay and direction are both leaden and the movie just lumbers along at a maddening pace.  The only reason this movie has become such a fan favorite is because of the pathetic state of horror movies at the time.  At a time when horror movies were more often than not actually comedies with gory special effects, a semi-serious movie was welcomed with open arms by fans wishing for some meat in their horror cinema.  Unfortunately, HELLRAISER has withered with age, though that didn't stop it from spawning its own brainless series of lame sequels.Worth a look, don't get me wrong, but nowhere nearly as good as its reputation would suggest.

A low budget British movie, packed full of gore, torture and grisly images, it sounds like just the kind of film that gets made and then disappears only to be rediscovered by horror geeks some twenty years later. Not so. There's something about HELLRAISER that stands it head and shoulders above the rest, and that thing is the presence of writer/director Clive Barker. Barker brings a level of originality and visceral intensity to this film that raises it to the heights of similar fare like Wes Craven's A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.The story is overshadowed by the presence of Pinhead and his fellow demons, each of them an S&M-influenced being who delights in causing pain and suffering. However, the main thrust of the film isn't actually about Pinhead and pals at all; instead, it's about the ultra-creepy and depraved character Uncle Frank and his destruction of an otherwise ordinary family. Uncle Frank is truly one of the most sickening and twisted creations in cinema and the thought of him hiding in that attic room is enough to give anyone chills, I imagine.In any case, this is a solid and eventful film; it's action packed, fast-paced and witty with it. The characters (especially the ones you love to hate) are well observed and the horror comes thick and fast, presented in a matter-of-fact, in-your-face fashion. Barker is just happy to get stuck in and get on with it, and it works. Yes, this is a film of the 1980s, so watching it today it feels a little cheesy. The rubbery special effects are dated &#x96; especially that upside-down demon, clearly pushed about on a trolley &#x96; but there's something endearing about them these days, and I'd still take them over CGI replacements. As an exercise in pure horror and skin-crawling revulsion, HELLRAISER works a treat.

Throw some demons from hell into the mix and you have got yourself a nightmare incarnate.I have seen Hellraiser numerous times, on VHS, on DVD, on Netflix streaming and now (thanks to Anchor Bay) on glorious Blu-Ray. There is really nothing anyone can say about this film that has not been said over the past twenty-five years Clive Barker is an amazing writer and through Hellraiser he became an amazing director. I do not know anyone who has seen this film that was not left with a positive impression.The effects in this film are great, perhaps second only to John Carpenter's The Thing. How they were able to create Frank's body piecing itself back together, I have no idea. The effects in Hellraiser II are similarly good, but the original stands head and shoulders above the rest.This is also the film that introduces us to Pinhead (Doug Bradley), easily one of the most iconic faces in horror. Only Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees are his equals as far as 1980s horror goes (with Michael Myers as an honorable mention)... and I am hard-pressed to think of a single 1970s or 1990s character that compares. Pinhead is in a league of his own, and it is Bradley's stern performance that sells this character.Hair historians can look back on this film and study the hairstyle known as the permanent wave. For some reason, everyone in this film (besides Frank) decided they needed to have a perm. By the second film, this is thankfully corrected (and Clare Higgins' appearance improves dramatically because of it).You have probably seen this film by now, but if you have not -- see it! Anchor Bay's Blu-Ray treatment will give you the best picture and sound imaginable, so if you do not already own it, this is a fine time to spring for a quality copy. Those who already have the DVD may not be ready to invest in the Blu-Ray just yet. I would, however, recommend the Anchor Bay box set. Although I think it has some flaws -- I would have liked to see more discs in here -- the packaging really makes the purchase worthwhile. The box itself, whether used for storing your DVDs or not, will look impressive on your shelf.

The basic story (ripped off a treat visually for the 1992 Mexican movie Cronos) concerned a lamentation puzzle box that brings four `demons', or Cenobites as they're known here, back from Hell. It's sequels diluted the format by taking one of the four (Doug Bradley, here notably credited only as `lead Cenobite', but later Christened `Pinhead') and attempted to turn him into a `Freddie'-like wise-cracking character. The idea that Pinhead could hold a film without the other three is ill-judged. Pinhead is there to deliver exposition as he's practically the only one that can speak (The token `female Cenobite' can, but prefers to hiss like a cat for some bizarre reason), but it's left to the two real stars &#150; Chatterer and Butterball &#150; to scare. The second film, which was good yet overambitious, saw the death of all four Cenobites, reduced to their human forms. The diabolical Hellraiser III Hell on Earth saw only Pinhead resurrected and nondescript Cenobite lackeys introduced to back up this all-new, all-punning creation. The fourth attempted to bring a level of seriousness back to the series, but by then it was too late. The initial movie may go too far some times in it's crass symbolism (a flower opens on a tv screen as Kirsty emerges from a coma), and the excess of gore and sexual tone do tend to kill off any evident horror. Horror, by my definition, is psychological, something experienced with the mind, whereas the smatterings of sex scenes are watched with the libido, causing a serious rift in viewing attention. When the Cenobites do finally appear (after Kirsty has been fiddling with the box, causing a C.S.Lewisian-breach in a hospital wall), they do scare, a primal fear somewhere between fear of torturous damnation and fear of bondage. Again, the `less is more' appearance of the quartet was a lesson not learnt in later instalments, as was the slow pacing of this debut.As with all horror movies, there are the serious flaws in logic that have to be overlooked to maintain enjoyment of the piece. As well as the traditional `lone female goes upstairs to investigate creak', we also get the `lone female's husband who is so niave he not only not knows she is having an affair but is also unable to smell the vast collection of rotting corpses she's got lined up in the spare room. (The quickest way Hellraiser could have ended is for Larry to have said `I'll go in the spare room and give it a lick of paint'. A brand-new house and he NEVER thinks to look around?). The other major flaw is that whenever someone fiddles with the lamentation (Pandora's) box they instantly get graphically torn to bits in a flurry of hooks, chains, and tomato sauce. Yet Kirsty always gets her chance for a nice talk first, a `please don't rip me to shreds, Cenobites, I was hoping to be in the sequel'. Pinhead will tear your soul apart&#133; unless you're the central heroine, then perhaps you can have a nice chat, put your feet up, a nice hot cup of tea&#133; At times an unpleasant and unnecessarily gory film, Hellraiser still pleases as one of the better late 80's horror features.

Maybe I'd heard that it was not very memorable compared to the others, or that the Pin-Head man on the video cover was kind of lame and not effective. Turns out the words I heard were kind of correct, even as this has its moments and is both two things at once extremely dated in its 80's settings while providing some gruesome practical effects and certainly 'unique' designs.If anything it's less to do with the typical slashers of the period and more akin to EC horror comic books (I thought of this as being like a feature-length episode from Creepshow - this is a movie that involves a torrid love affair from the past that comes back to haunt Julia (Clare Higgins) who moves in to the house where her husband Larry's (Andrew Robinson) brother Frank used to squat in... oh, and she had an affair with him years before. But as it turns out Frank is, uh, a puddle of goo due to a magic box that has made him die via beings from another dimension or hell or other (I wasn't clear from where, point is they're gnarly demons that Tim Burton thought were probably too garish), and Frank needs blood in order to regenerate his flesh.The movie could have even been a comedy; the premise reminded me of a much more garish, black-death take on like Little Shop of Horrors. The whole scenario is rather nightmarish, but it's not your typical slasher; it's more about when the next big murder will take place by this mulletted would-be femme fatale for this regenerating bloody-man-thing, and how soon the husband or his daughter. There's imagery related to Jesus Christ (he's literally hiding in the trunk, his statue I mean), and Barker, as director, is all about style. This is a pure style over substance movie - what substance is there, the actual story and characters, is fairly weak/standard, though it's livened somewhat by Andrew Robinson (you remember him as Scorpio in Dirty Harry, right?) There are many shots early on of gruesome bugs and roaches and filth, and then from there you also have the demons themselves, with them all being done with practical effects.But what starts early on as seeming impressive - the highlight of seeing the first time that Frank starts to regenerate from a tiny drop of blood into organs and lungs and skeleton into something resembling an anatomy figure on a textbook cover - gets to be into a laughable horror show spectacle in the final act. It's here that Barker just lets rip with the grotesque house of horrors (literally, it's in a house and there are a lot of horror-creature images), and while the creativity is there, it's also not very compelling or scary or frightening. The young actress Ashley Laurence does her best, but by a certain point just seems at the mercy of the oddness of what the script has her doing, specifically with the 'MacGuffin' that is also pictured on the cover.The original Hellraiser must have some kind of reputation among modern horror fans and enthusiasts, but whether it's people who like it legitimately or based on the many sequels it looks better in retrospect I'm not sure I know at this point. It's entertaining as being a slightly more serious version of what one might see in an Evil Dead movie. Barker certainly packs on the nightmarish s***, but it's at the cost of a lot of story logic and decisions by characters that make little sense, and in the last ten minutes it's all over-the-top madness (still bumped up thanks to Robinson, I must add). At times it's shot and acted like a Lifetime movie, and other times it recalls the Romero/King style of a wild horror fantasy extravaganza. So it is what it is - and, again, very 80's.

This gave rise to the iconic Pinhead and made Clive Barker very much a household name (if he wasn't by then). Based on The Hellbound Heart the story had great potential, albeit putting any Clive Barker movie on the big screen is of high risk, as the poetry and literary flare of this writer is way ahead of any else in the genre.Clive Barker is to horror what Iain M. Banks is to sci-fi... an unhinged reservoir of invention, make-believe and limitless imagination with an astounding use of the language to boot. It always seem slightly awkward that such a talented writer delved in the horror genre, but he did...Personally I hold Hellraiser as Clive Barker's second biggest on-screen success closely following Candyman, but the movie 20 years onwards still packs an immense punch and should be required watching.Frank Cotton (Sean Chapman) is in constant search of thrills and adventure. During one escapade he purchases a small cube from a dealer somewhere in the Moslem world. Unswayed by the consequences he opens the cube thus opening the gateway to pain inhabited by the Cenobites - by some held as devils, by other as angels...Some time later his brother Larry (Andrew Robinson) and his new wife Julia (Claire Higgins) move into the derelict house, where Frank was last alive. Larry's daughter Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) decides against living with her father and stepmother renting a room in town with her boyfriend. A chance accident at the house awakes the past and frees what remains of Frank from his prison...The greatest success of this movie is being gruesome while being tasteful at the same time. The gore is present and will make you cringe and despite the retro feel to the movie it is light years ahead of most modern horror films. Holds well despite the time passing by, albeit some special effects are in need of an emergency update (hence maybe the remake planned for 2011?). That said all the monsters themselves look just as good and impressive as ever and Pinhead really will make you want to run.The acting is nothing of note, but at the same time does not detract from the guilty watching pleasure. The movies main flaw (as with most screen adaptation of Barker's) is its lacking script, which goes awry somewhere in the last 30 minutes. The motivation of the Cenobites takes a hit by the lack of build-up and Barker really should have focused more effort on presenting the 'otherworlders' and what makes them tick. Some of the lines sold by Pinhead and his posse is just weak scriptwriting. More sinister and complex actions of the evil they represented would really benefit the movie. This movie really is more like a 'introduction' to the Cenobites, hence can't really be surprised several sequels were panned out in the subsequent years. Molding several of them together would really make one hell of a movie...

Watching this movie by myself for the first time, I found it retains the frightening elements that stood out to me in the past. Hellraiser is equal parts spiritual/psychological/contemplative horror and gore. The highlights of the film are the Cenobites -- minions of hell and purveyors of sinister, dark pleasures beyond the threshold of mortal perception. The movie begins with Frank, a guy on a mad quest for said dark pleasures beyond the human realm of perception, who purchases a strange box and naively summons the Cenobites to appear. Frank disappears and his brother, Larry and Larry's wife, Julia, inherit the house. Of course, the box is still present, Frank isn't quite dead in the typical sense, and hideous hi-jinks are bound to ensue. Hellraiser set a benchmark when it came out, with a new standard of mainstream horror and gore. Several scenes had to be edited or cut out of the film to receive an appropriate R rating for theatrical release. But it is not merely a gore-fest, but features psychological and dark spiritual elements that are far more curious and horrifying than any of the violence. Indeed, merely these psychological elements would have been enough to scare the viewer, but combined with the excellent make-up and dusty atmosphere the movie becomes a very vivid, intoxicating experience. My main qualm with the whole movie was how the film paced so slowly in the middle and focused so much on the family members, yet never really exposed very much about them. We don't see much about the dynamics or quality of the love triangle between Julia and Frank or Larry. We do understand how they are linked in theory, but it's so impersonally displayed -- they might as well be silhouettes. The same goes for Larry's daughter, Kristy, and her relationship with her stepmother.This detracts from the movie because it is a fairly lengthy film (almost 2 hours) which takes place mostly in one dimly lit house. And though the demonic Cenobites (the lead one being the famous recurring 'Pinhead' character) are the notable centerpiece of the film, they appear sparingly -- though to great horrific effect when they do.This is notable of the first Hellraiser film, the only one completely written and directed by Clive Barker the Cenobites are not typical character villains, but horrific spiritual entities that lay beyond our sensory perceptions. Their ghoulish power exceeds mere evil; they are deep, authentic arbiters of the desire realm. In this sense, Hellraiser distinguishes itself from its contemporary horror films -- typical slashers, torture porn and suspense-horror. The Cenobites are not really villains because they are beyond human and have no hunger for victims. They answer and assist those who summon them, whether or not the summoning is intentional. In fact, the most disturbing facet of these characters is how mesmerizing and intriguing they are, how potently ugly they are, and how easily the viewer is pulled in while they're on the screen. That infatuation is genuinely scary.The later films would fail to capitalize on this subtle-yet-sophisticated brand of horror and degenerate into average or above-average supernatural-slasher films. But the first one is fairly true to Clive Barker's literary vision and features amazing special effects. Even today the hideous, gory make-up and sinister creature designs are steps beyond anything else in film. This is a truly dark film, one which takes cues from H.P. Lovecraft and may have inspired the brilliant Japanese animation, Berserk.

Now, after I've seen it at this age, I can say that it doesn't have the same effect on me as it did before, but it still was a good movie. It's about a deranged man who was supposed to be trapped in a puzzle box, but somehow escaped and now he must feed on other humans to sustain his body. His previous girlfriend helps him out in leading men into his trap. The problem is, the being that inhabit that world want him back and will do anything to get him.What I want to mention, that should get some credibility, is the excellent set design and general décor the movie. It's a fantastic blend of fantasy scenes and Gothic decorations, with a bit of a S&M touch to it. Specific sets that should be noted are the attic of the house (A great example of Gothic style), the set with the turning blocks of wood and chains (a great example of S&M meets Gothic design) and the hospital sequence, which is a great example of horror fantasy. It's one of the things that really stood out in this movie that I don't think many people notice.Now to brass tax; the horror and the gore is so overdone in this movie that it's practically blinds the movie from anything else, but that's exactly why I love this movie. There are so many great scenes where there was an excessive amount of bloody violence including people getting pulled apart by chains, skinless people eaters and a strange room with skin and chunks of meat nailed to wooden boards. Aside from the gore, there were some scary moments in this film that include that thing between the walls of the hospital, that sequence creeped me out a bit. Even the Cenobites had a pretty freaky design, mostly Butterball and Chatter. Even with the unnecessary amount of blood and guts, it's still fun to watch.Overall, this was a weird and wild ride that is both strangely erratic and horrifically Gothic and gory. It's one of those movies that you expect to have a lot of production value and revolutionary set pieces and animation, and though it's not it still blows you away with some pretty good sets and a whole lot of blood and guts. With the acting aside and the complicated plot, this movie is not all that bad and is perhaps one of my favorite movies. I would recommend this movie to anybody who loves Clive Barker for one, and to those who love a good gore film. However, this is not a horror film that suits every horror fans fancy, but you have to like the genre. As for me, I still love this movie aside from the cheesy acting and excessive unnecessary gore.

The imagery on the screen is bone chilling and will make your skin crawl, the characters he creates are absolutely terrifying and his image of what Hell is like will change your point of view on the subject forever. Every actor/actress in this film puts on a brilliant performance. The film centers around a man named Frank Cotton who makes a 'deal with the devil' in the film's opening sequence purchasing a mysterious Japanese puzzle box which opens the gateways to Hell. Seeking new pleasures, he solves the puzzle and is torn to pieces by the now legendary character Pinhead (played brilliantly by Doug Bradley) and his legion of Cenobites (demonic creatures from the pits of Hell). A few months later his brother Larry and his wife Julia move into Frank's deserted home along with Larry's daughter Kirsty. It is soon revealed that Julia had a sexually charged affair with Frank on her wedding night and when Larry cuts his hand open during the course of the move, the blood that seeps into the floorboards brings forth life, from a strange looking cocoon from Hell underneath the house,in the form of Frank. Frank is only partially alive though as he is seen as merely bones, blood and rotting flesh tissue. Julia encounters him and agrees to procure 'victims' for him in order to help make him whole again so that they may escape before the Cenabites realize that Frank has escaped their clutches. Kirsty begins to become suspicious of her stepmother's bizarre behavior and begins to investigate the situation. Soon she discovers Frank hidden in the attic, now a bloody mess of tissue, muscles, nerves and flesh but nearly complete except for the skin. Kirsty barely escapes the clutches of Julia and Frank but manages to steal the puzzle box. She solves it and summons the Cenobites, striking a bargain with them by promising to deliver Frank to them in exchange for sparing her own life and helping her to save her father from Julia and Frank. She is too late however as she returns to the house, only to discover that Larry has been murdered and Frank has assumed his identity and wishes to murder Kirsty and have sex with her (in that order). A strange and unusual yet powerful ending results when the Cenobites come for Frank which winds up setting the scene for the inevitable sequel (it has been said that writers had already begun work on the sequel even before filming on this one had completed). The sequel Hellbound Hellraiser 2 is actually very well done, fans would be well advised however to skip all of the rest of the sequels. Hellraiser is a highly recommended for all fans of horror and the occult...it will change your life forever! Warning This is an extremely gory film and is NOT for the weak of heart!

On one hand, the film has some truly frightening moments (the wife's discovery of the resurrected but decomposing brother) and some completely gratuitous ones (the opening sequence where the brother gets tortured is the epitome of abundance- surely when scaring people, less is more?). The acting is truly shocking too- the fact these people have not had big roles in any other watchable movies since this, speaks volumes. It comes across as a slightly voyeuristic experience- it is frightening but a little too bloodthirsty and full of cheesy b-movie actors and dialogue to be called a classic. The 1980s remake of The Fly does what Hellraiser is trying to do, far more effectively. If you want a powerful horror experience of the same era, watch that instead.

I duly took myself to the local flea-pit, but remember leaving feeling rather unimpressed.Two decades on, and I thought I'd give the film another chance (it only seemed fair, since I had met star Ashley Laurence at a convention in the interim, and was VERY impressed with her!).And the good news is that, over the years, my tastes have obviously matured (just a fraction) this time around, I enjoyed the majority of Clive Barker's twisted directorial debut much more, although a rather weak ending does spoil what I would now consider to be an otherwise pretty remarkable film.The gorgeous Ms. Laurence plays Kirsty, daughter of mild mannered Larry (Andrew Robinson), step-daughter to the icy Julia (Claire Higgins), and niece of untrustworthy scoundrel Frank (Sean Chapman). Poor Kirsty's life becomes a living hell when she discovers that Julia is murdering men in order to help regenerate the body of her Uncle Frank, who has recently escaped from a hellish limbo where he was tortured by a group of demons (known as Cenobites, led by the freaky Pinhead)..After playing with the supernatural puzzle known as the 'lament configuration', the cause of Frank's predicament, Kirsty is forced to strike a deal with the Cenobites&#151;deliver Frank back to them or face an eternity of suffering herself.With Frank and Julia being equally as monstrous as the film's demons, there is no shortage of unsettling nastiness in Hellraiser, and Barker delights in showing viewers every gory detail. Frank's gradual resurrection, through the absorption of blood, is pretty horrific, but it is the cold manner in which Julia dispatches of the men she lures back to her house that really got to me a couple of blows from a claw hammer on the back of the head&#151;ouch!.Pinhead and his sado-masochistic pals are also extremely chilling. Although they definitely lost some of their ability to scare in subsequent sequels (much as Freddy Krueger did in the Elm Street series), they are at their most menacing in this first outing their unwelcome appearance after Kirsty unwittingly solves their puzzle is one of the film's most effective moments, being genuinely disturbing and extremely frightening.In fact, with so much of Barker's film being so flawlessly enjoyable, it's a real shame that the finale is so lame after Frank steals Larry's skin (why he is unable to regenerate that particular body part, I don't know), he is finally sent back to hell, and the Cenobites turn their attention to Kirsty, hoping to show her the dubious delights of their realm. Somehow, however, Kirsty realises that the answer to her salvation is to once again play with the lament configuration. As she fiddles with the malevolent puzzle box, the Cenobites do practically nothing to stop her, and eventually disappear in a glut of bad visual effects. To make matters worse, a dreadfully rubbery monster also shows up to unsuccessfully try and stop her from completing the puzzle.Finally, with the evil vanquished, Kirsty throws the troublesome object into a fire, only to have it retrieved by a tramp who turns into a laughable, skeletal, winged creature and flies away!!! This ridiculously OTT ending seems completely incongruous with all that has gone before, and stops the film from being a total success. Maybe, just maybe, the upcoming remake will address this problem, and we will finally get a wholly satisfying Hellraiser movie. But I doubt it.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.

Hellraiser is a gentle little tale about a mysterious box that brings the pleasures and pains of Heaven and Hell to the person manipulating the box. Now, I didn't see anything dealing with Heaven in this movie but did see those creatures which obviously were guardians of some type to the entrance to hell(hence the title I believe). The story is really about one Frank Cotton who buys the box in the Middle East(possibly Northern Africa) at the film's beginning. He opens the gates and is really hooked into what the box has to offer. Death by Cenobites(weird creatures that will show you what the world cannot). Frank's brother and his wife move into the house. Brother cuts his hand and bleeds profusely on floorboards under which Frank's emaciated carcass resides, and, Voila, blood begins to bring Frank back to life - some kind of fleshy bare existence. Fortunately for Frank, he had had an affair with his brother's wife and she will help him resume his former self by luring unsuspecting guys to his room where they can really help flesh out his character. Well, that is the basic premise. Of course there is a lot more to it including more Cenobites and lots and lots of blood and gore. Barker certainly uses a hyperbolic bloody style in his films. The gore is plentiful, yet the acting, even the story to some degree, and the creative direction of Barker make this film entertaining and the springboard of many, many sequels and a sort of mythos that goes with the whole series. The story is bizarre and a bit hard to understand fully, but I imagine that was what Barker was striving for. The direction is straightforward despite the level of incredulity in the script, and the actors are all pretty decent. Newcomer Ashley Laurence plays the heroine and is adequate, but sultry English actress Clare Higgins brings the film some credibility. And let's not forget Doug Bradley as Pinhead. He is indeed interesting and outer-worldly. Overall, I enjoyed Hellraiser as a open-to-interpretation kind of horror film. It is a lot bloodier than my tastes generally like, but the style and atmosphere used throughout did not turn it off for me. I will gladly see the sequels with anticipation. Barker; however; will be an acquired taste at best. A definite bonus is the lush, hauntimg score that really brings this feature up in so many ways.

Having lost his earthly body to a trio of S&M demons, the Cenobites, he is brought back into existence by a drop of blood on the floor. He soon forces his former mistress to bring him his necessary human sacrifices to complete his body... but the Cenobites won't be happy about this.- I've always thought that Hellraiser is a good movie, but I am not as in love with it as a lot of horror fans. The special effects seem to be one of the major draws and, while I agree that they are very well done, I'm just not into a lot of gore effects. I will give the special effects people credit for some jaw dropping moments. If this movie were made today, CGI would replace (and ruin) a lot of what's seen. Hellraiser is one of the better examples of what can be done with real effects.- Pinhead and, to a lesser extent, the other Cenobites have become cultural icons. But, in Hellraiser, they are given so little screen time that they are really nothing more than minor supporting players. Watching the movie, you learn very little about the Cenobites and how they came to be (it's not until the sequels that we learn anything about their origin). Had there never been all of the sequels, I contend that Pinhead and his buddys wouldn't be nearly as famous as they are.- I suppose my biggest problem with the movie is the characters. For me to completely enjoy a horror movie, there has to be someone I care about. None of these characters are worth empathy. I suppose the daughter could be a character I could care about, but she has so little screen time until she's under attack that I never felt as if I knew her.

I thought, this old coot doesn't know the word classic if it hit him in the face. Then I saw the movie. While I think half a star is over-exaggerating, I pretty much respect Ebert's review. The fact that so many horror-fans praise this film, as well as critics, just boggles my mind. Tell me what is so great about it? I have seen a plethora of horror classics and I love them all except this one, but come on. Wooden performances, cringe-worthy dialogue, cheesy special effects, an uninteresting plot. This movie is just not great. It's not even good. I think had Clive Barker's name not been attached or had Hellraiser not been a staple in horror, this movie would have been trashed. First up, the plot is so uninteresting that I almost turned off this movie mid-way. Okay so this wife has been unfaithful to her husband in the past. There's a shock! But wait... the guy she committed infidelity with died and now is coming back alive! Sound interesting? Guess how he comes back alive? After the teen girl's dad in this movie gets his hand screwed up and he bleeds. That has got to be the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Not only that but this movie is called Hellraiser yet you don't see the damn thing until the final five minutes. No lie. The movie should have been called Emo General Hospital but the last five minutes are actually cool. And, if you think him resurrecting with blood is cool, it's not. It's just about some slutty woman and her boring relationship. That would make a decent subplot but not when it takes up most of the running time. You'd think with such an uninteresting plot that the performances would at least be tolerable? Oh have you came to the wrong place. Everyone in this movie just gets on my last nerve and I seriously don't care about anybody. Not to mention the dialogue is just abysmal. Let's not forget the uninspired direction.Now, the reason why all you horror buffs are here. For Hellraiser torturing the crap out of people. Well guess what. Too bad. You see Hellraiser torture one person. That's it. And, it's at the last five minutes! Not only that but there's hardly any gore in this movie. Talk about false advertising. Oh and dead animals don't count Barker. All in all, Hellraiser is by far the most overrated horror classic I've ever seen. A terrible script, an amateur direction, cringe-worthy dialogue. And just when you think it couldn't get worse, even the gore and trap scenes are unsatisfying. I'm sorry if I seem harsh on this movie but I was just severely disappointed. Had I known this was a soap opera, I wouldn't have rented this movie.

For reason I'd just never got around to watching it despite owning the score CDs to the first three.Clive Barker (adapting his own novel) does pretty good for a first-time feature director and brings a rawness to the movie that feels a lot like Bernard Rose's approach to Paperhouse. Those of you who are familiar with British horror films might notice some similarities in the appearance of both films. Strange though, how a British film can have all of one English accent in it.The story has hedonistic adventurer Frank Cotton solve a mythical puzzle box only to be sent to a realm of pain/pleasure for all eternity. Not exactly the best prize in the world, I'd prefer Bruce Forsythe to appear and shout 'Didn't he do effing well' instead of Pinhead (here just called Lead Cenobite) and his hooks.An indefinite amount of time passes and Frank's brother and sister-in law move into the house where he solved the puzzle. Blood is spilled on the floor and Frank's physical body has a chance to exist again, as long as he receives more and more blood that is. His sister-in law, with whom he has had an affair, is only too happy to lure victims to attic for Frank to feed on. The basis of any solid relationship.Frank's niece, Kirsty, catches on to their diabolical plan and steals the puzzle box only for Pinhead and his minions to appear and threaten her with an eternity of pain. She begs to be let go and promises to surrender her uncle if they do so.Hellraiser fails in too many places to really stand as a straight-up fantasy/horror. The differences between pleasure and pain are never clearly defined. The origins and mechanics of the box are never explained. There is not really any mystery surrounding any of the characters since Barker rushes us straight into their situation as soon as we are introduced to them. Pinhead himself doesn't even come across as a villain.What holds Hellraiser together and distracts from the poor narrative is Chris Young's majestic score which is a thing of beauty. The music to Hellraiser is honestly a masterpiece, a symphony, an opera of darkness and mystery. Wherever the films fails, the score picks up.I might check out the endless sequels. If they elaborate on the box or on Pinhead then they might be worth it. But since it took me 20 years to get round to watching the first...

I'll assume you're familiar with the premises.  If not--there's this evil box.  This box summons some celestial entities that really aren't bad in the conventional sense, they just really, really like pain, and they want to show you this pain they really, really like.  Pain so great that it is indivisable from pleasure.  And there's this dead guy who somehow got away after they ripped him up with hooks.  Now he's a bad guy because he's eating peoples skins and stuff so that he stops looking so icky (he was only partially resurrected, so he starts off as an emaciated, dehydrated, skinless corpse.  With each victim, he gets more juicy and filled out).  His neice accidentally triggers the Cenobites (those entities that like pain) and they get on his case.As you may be able to surmise from the summary, this movie is a lot more concentrated on the skinless uncle than the actual Cenobites.  This is quite a bit disappointing, since he's not an especially interesting character, just your normal over-bearing sadistic type.  The Cenobites are an interesting concept, but not nearly as disturbing as people pass them off to be.  Twisted nether beings have invaded literature for a while, though this was likely the first time the idea has so well been committed to film.  Wish they'd shown us the Hell from which these beings came from--that would have been interesting.For being a horror classic, there are surprisingly few scares.  In fact, the entire movie builds up to a climax that never happens.  You have buildup, retreat, and denouement, but no real showdown.  I can only think of one moment that was designed to make the audience jump.  Other than that, the gore was probably the biggest horror aspect, and even that is not too extreme.  I watched this back to back with the Story of Rikki and the only thing this film had going for it by comparison was a skinless chap.  Indeed, the entire movie seems impressive mostly to people who haven't delved terribly deep into the cinematic outer reaches.  Hellraiser is probably at the edge of mainstream and as far as many people are wont to travel in their cinematic voyages.  The connection between pain and pleasure isn't as strong as in such films as Ichi the Killer (I'm sorry, but it's far more thematically relevant to see a regular man mutilate himself for pleasure than a demon with an exposed trachea) and is probably the most disturbing aspect that relies the most on audiences not venturing too far away from Hollywood's glistening spires.Oh well, I'm about to see Hellraiser 2, which supposedly solves many of the first's problems.

His ideas for plots are unique and his out of the ordinary characters are way, way out of the ordinary. Visually this has some great looking elements, and the special effects are neat, and the actors all do a fine job, but this movie just doesn't have enough of anything to really take off. By the end, it feels a lot like a mediocre Nightmare on Elm Street sequel.Larry (Andrew Robinson) and Julia (Clare Higgins) are a married couple who have just moved into a new house, and Julia discovers something very strange about this place. After accidentally spilling blood on the floor of the attic, Frank, Julia's former lover, and half brother of Larry comes back to life (Sounding a bit soap opera-ish), but with no skin. He explains that a puzzle box he solved was actually a summoner of demon like creatures known as the Cenubites, and they tore his body apart and stole his soul. He needs Julia to provide blood so he can come back in full with skin. Meanwhile, Larry's daughter Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) has been snooping on her step-mother and eventually comes face to face with the demons that previously had control of her Uncle Frank. Chaos ensues.This movie has some great looking scenes. The fantasy characters, like the Cenubites, are all very imaginative and scary looking, minus a creature that moves awkwardly with the track visible. The original scene of Frank coming back from the dead is one of the most interesting transformations on screen, and the lighting is often perfect in this movie. Unfortunately, this movie's positives mostly end at the aesthetic pleasures, as most other elements of the film just aren't very good.The acting is the one positive that isn't completely visual. The acting is just fine, and the lead actors give professional and good performances. But the movie itself just still isn't very good. Throughout, the film just moves along mediocrely, and never really breaks any boundaries that make this a truly outstanding film, and even the make-up, which is good, is better in Barker's next film Nightbreed. Throughout this movie feels like one of the Nightmare on Elm Street sequels. You never really know what's what and who's who, and what game's this universe goes by and it leads to a level of uncomfortability, which is probably what Barker was going for. It's not a fun watch. The movie keeps leading up to a lame climax, and then the downright bizarre ending comes off as dumb and hokey instead of really a neat way to end the film.This isn't a bad horror flick, but it's one that doesn't ever stand out. Throughout it's only slightly better than your average B-movie horror film, and it never picks up and takes off like it seems like it should. So despite fine performances, and interesting creatures, and maybe even some scares, this movie is just never good enough to earn the cult that follows the series.My rating ** out of ****. 93 mins. R for sexuality, strong violence and gore and language.

Flash forward when couple Larry (Andrew Robinson) and Julia (Clare Higgins) buy the house and after blood drops on the floor, Frank comes back to life only as a skinless monster. He convinces Julia that she should bring men back to the house so that he can drink their blood, which he hopes will return his flesh. This here is just the first half of the movie as things get a lot wilder in the second half when the box is opened yet again. As a kid I really didn't care for this movie because it wasn't like the more popular horror films out there at the time. With that said, seeing the film now one can enjoy it for the fact that it is unlike the slasher craze that was going on during this era. I found the movie to play out a lot like an EC comic as the story here is pretty far-fetched but it's an interesting one. Having a skinless man needing blood to bring his flesh back isn't anything ground breaking but it makes for an entertaining story. What helps even more is that all the characters are fully developed and this adds some nice drama to the mix as the good girl Julia soon finds herself doing acts that she's never think possible. The drama between her and husband Larry works just fine as does the drama built up when his daughter enters the film. Another major plus here are the special effects, which allows for some ooze and gore. I loved the look of Frank when we first see him and the design as more and more flesh begins to grow on his body looks incredible. The effect is rather simple but the way he oozes is enough to keep horror fans entertained. When other monsters aren't as well displayed here as they would be in upcoming sequels but I found the earlier stuff with Frank to be a lot more entertaining. Performances, for the most part, are really good with Chapman stealing the film as Frank. Robinson, best known for his psycho role in DIRTY HARRY, is also quite good as is Higgins. Barker's direction doesn't feature masterful camera-work but he is able to build a wonderful atmosphere that really helps the film. The pacing is also very good as the 90-minutes go by very quickly.

Besides, unlike many a horror film from the 80s, the lead characters are nicely developed it was great to see Andy Robinson again in a film (best known for playing Scorpio, the unforgettable psycho who unwisely pits himself against Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry Callahan, in Don Siegel's classic 1971 original) though, for most of the time, here he plays the good-guy type; Clare Higgins is convincing as his wife, who becomes a reluctant accomplice in his dead brother Frank's 're-animation'; Ashley Laurence, as Robinson's teenage daughter from an earlier marriage, emerges after a while as the film's true main character (who even went to reprise her role in 3 of the film's myriad sequels!). The special effects are, for lack of a better word, efficiently repulsive - especially in the creation of the hellish Cenobites (an interestingly varied bunch of monsters if ever there was one!) and their excruciating endeavors.Still, despite being one of the more popular horror releases from its era, I'm baffled that it should have spawned so many follow-ups and, to be honest, it hasn't made me all that eager to seek them out (even though my local DVD rental outlet seems to carry the majority of them!)...

It was in a friend's bedroom and it had the scariest looking person plastered across the middle of it. This person was the notorious Pinhead. Written underneath his white, bald, nail impaled head was the title Hellraiser. I decided then that this was a film I would never dare watch. Recently however I decided that I should give this a chance as it is classed as a horror classic. I have to say I wish I had stuck to my original instinct and never actually watched this film. Not because it's scary but because it is dreadful.The film follows four characters. To start with we see Frank (Chapman), a pleasure seeker who obtains a box. Once he solves the puzzle on the box he is transported to hell where he is put through ultimate pain by the Cybernites. After his pain he manages to escape and ends up being imbedded in the floor boards of his old family home.Next we see couple Larry and Julia. Larry is Frank's brother and Julia is his girlfriend who once had an affair with Frank, something she can't stop fantasising about. The couple decide to move into this now abandoned house and whilst there Larry cuts himself, spilling the blood on the floorboards in the attic. The blood brings Frank back to life, but not completely human, just enough to be seen. As Frank begins to be reformed Julia notices him and her arousal towards him comes rushing back despite the state he is in. Soon it becomes clear that the more blood Frank receives, the more he re-forms. Due to Julia's infatuation with him she brings men back to the house with the promise of sex, only to kill them and allow Frank to take the blood. The final character is Larry's daughter Kirsty, who dislikes her new mother-in-law Julia and stumbles across her Uncle Frank as he is regenerating. We get some feeling from his intimidation towards her that perhaps he raped her or fathered her, either way he forces her to run away with the box, and accidentally call the Cybernites. Pinhead then turns up trying to take her away to inflict some pain but she tries to strike a deal with them and deliver Frank back to them. Each part of the film seems to follow a different character and to be fair I didn't care about any of them what so ever. I think half of the problem with that was the considerably terrible acting that was on show. It really was bad. Each character also seems to be really miserable, with no joy in their lives at all, meaning they were so one dimensional it wasn't believable.The horror of it was also non-existent. Now I'm not saying horrors are particularly realistic but this one was beyond stupid. Fair enough Freddy Kruger and Michael Myers are not realistic, but I bought into their world and they were frightening. Here we got monsters that looked like puppets, and Cybernites that were nowhere near as scary as I was expecting them to be. The poster of them was far scarier. This film, considering the puppet like monsters and Ashley Laurence's striking resemblance to Winona Ryder, was like watching Beetlejuice, without the comedy of course.I'll move onto Pinhead, whose image alone was the sole reason I watched this film. Let me tell you now Pinhead is barely in it. The fact that he has become a horror icon because of this is ridiculous because he isn't scary, has no screen time, pops up at strange moments when the story felt it needed something scary, and has an actor playing him so poorly that his lines would have been delivered better by the talking clock. Pinhead does not deserve to be an icon due to this movie.Everything about this film is bad. It isn't a patch on Halloween, Friday the 13th, A Nightmare On Elm Street or, to an extent, Candyman. And they were all made before this and done everything horror films should do. Maybe they were trying to do something different here but it purely did not work. Horror fans love this movie, and for some reason put it on a pedestal but I can't understand why. This was certainly not the scary horror movie, with the scary horror icon that I was expecting.1 / 5For more reviews www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.uk "},{"Title":"Does sadly not age with grace... mostly quite horrible, silly and hammy.","Date":"1 September 2008","Score":"3 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":" The first time I saw this in 1987, I honestly thought it was pretty good. 21 years later on a re-watch, it's a quite different, disappointing ball game An OK original horror-premise and some effectively shocking scenes (Ugh &#x97; those hammer murders!) are still there.

The idea that their is a passageway to Hell brings forth a new type of horror that we have yet to see on film, until now. Ghosts, killers, and aliens are all terrifying ideas but religion takes it a step further with ideas such as Heaven and Hell.

The first in a series of a hundred or so films, this is the only one I've seen with a coherent story. Shame it's told with dodgy acting and pretentious dialogue; this is the kind of movie whose pomposity and self-importance clash with scenes where a skinless love interest wanders around the place saying 'Come to daddy'.Andrew Robinson moves to London with his wife (Clare Higgins) and daughter (Ashley Laurence) and encounters all the usual problems of moving in to a new house the plumbing doesn't work, the bed won't fit up the stairs, his brother's corpse coerces his wife into bringing him victims so he can drain their blood and regenerate himself. It's all due to the memorably-designed puzzle box, a demented Rubik's Cube that, when solved, summons the hellish cenobites, who introduce you to all the delights of being strung up on hooks.The emphasis here is on gooey make-up and effects, but unfortunately they look exactly like make-up and effects, with a generous dollop of KY jelly. It's all very rubbery and fake, which is probably due to budgetary restrictions rather than a lack of skill, but whatever the reason it doesn't really work. For all its gory effects, the most horrific moments in 'Hellraiser' come courtesy of Higgins' painfully '80s hairdo. The scare factor isn't boosted by the bargain basement lightning effects that occur when the box is opened, as they were apparently achieved with animation cels and some felt-tip pens.The make-up on head cenobite Doug Bradley is an interesting visual, though, which is probably why he was promoted from the depths of the cast list here to the star of the sequels. The rest of the film's imagery is made up of chains, hooks, leather, nails and barbed wire, which means that various characters I didn't care about get pierced by sharp things in ways that had no effect on me. I didn't believe in any of it, and I especially didn't believe that Robinson could live in the same house as his blood-sucking brother without running into him on the way to the bathroom.This is a ramshackle ghost train of a movie, all the mechanisms showing as you trundle through it wondering why you bothered.

I've always felt the horror genre have been mistreated in Hollywood industry and seldom is given a chance to reach it's full potential. That's why I expected something more from Hellraiser, I suppose. That other 80's slasherflicks such as Friday The 13th, low on both budget and intelligence, fail to scare me doesn't exactly surprise me. However, after seeing a few sequels to this movie I was favourably surprised. It sure isn't Dostoyevsky, but at least there was some substance to the script, and once in a while the director managed to create a chilling scene or two. So, after hearing people praise the original for it's originality and atmosphere, I figured this could be a truly frightening movie. It isn't, really. Unpleasant perhaps, being somewhat gorier than other Hollywood-produced horrormovies. But that doesn't make for an interesting watch. I found the plot badly executed, predictable and well...as I said, it didn't scare me. This is quite an influential film though, since several other movies lend the film's S&M-inspired style. But if you truly want to be scared out of your mind, I'd rather recommend In The Mouth Of Madness, a book by H.P. Lovecraft or perhaps one of David Lynch's darker moments.4/10 "},{"Title":"Oh Hell.","Date":"9 April 2003","Score":"2 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  Silly would-be-shocker that was spawned due to the success of other mindless horror flicks of the 1980s. Hellraiser tries to dazzle with hopelessly dated special effects and a storyline that tires more than it interests. Andrew Robinson and Clare Higgins move into an old mansion and soon Higgins learns that her former lover (and Robinson's brother) still lives in a deep corner of the house. Of course he is now a terrifying monster who needs the blood of other men to exist the way he previously did. Oh yes, there is also a Lamont Configuration (a glorified Pandora's Box) that is a doorway to hell as well (yawn). The film introduces Pinhead (played by the boring Doug Bradley) and he ended up being an odd sort of cult hero to many film enthusiasts of the period. Clive Barker's directing debut is little more than an ugly mess. His novel (which was not much of a masterpiece either) makes even less sense on the big screen. A total waste that only fans of the genre will find any value in. A precursor to countless imitations and worse---several unwanted sequels. Turkey (0 stars out of 5).  "},{"Title":"Pinhead .

New slice of a kind of Boogieman. A comedy with flavor of horror. In fact, only a impressive work of the Pinmeister. The art of improvisation is all. The game, mixture of joy and metamorphosis of reality is heart of this film about God but, more that, about the hope and its roots.Interpretation of Pinhead is not a surprise but the great piece is art to define a fight in different terms. And the science to escape behind any trap. Because no crime, no errors, no gray perceptions are absent. Hell is not fiction and the demons are the enemy. But the role of huge show is more small. The relations between ordinary people and the resistance of absurd vision about reality is more powerful. So, it is not a war movie. It is not a comedy. Only picture of a world. And a extraordinary Pinheaded mime who gives sense to many small facts.

Clive Barker has written a very original horror film script, but it does come too close to the ridiculous most of the time. I wasn't scared for a second even though I did laugh a lot. However, two of the cenobites -- Pinhead and the female one -- were rather unpleasant because they were so solemn. Otherwise&#133; nah, nothing that I can recommend. This film can't possibly scare horror film fans *or* people who don't watch many horror films, so I really don't know who Hellraiser was made for.

Somewhat interesting, in the end I find them to be a bit over done in areas and under done in others.  Sometimes it is over the top, and at other times it is kind of boring.  The story has this guy solving a puzzle box and when you solve the puzzle box you get chains through your body, then you are ripped apart.  This seems to me to be like more of a disincentive to full around with the box, but that doesn't seem to stop anyone in the series.  The guy is later resurrected and has to kill and suck blood (not in the way a vampire does).  He is helped by his brother's wife as they are lovers.  Nothing to unpredictable about where all this leads.  Meanwhile, the daughter of the husband (I don't think the wife is her mother) accidentally solves the puzzle box and here comes Pinhead who is in the movie very little.  Considering he was on the poster and he is what everyone remembers his screen time amounts to maybe five or ten minutes.  All in all a bit of a twisted horror that might appeal to you, but I actually liked the sequels a bit more.  Though not by much.

I know (for whatever reason) some people LOVE this thing, but I found it to be a complete waste of time.Other users have claimed it had first rate acting. I don't know what films they're comparing this to, but these actors are awful. As for gore, this has no more gore than half of the other horror or action movies out there. The special effects are cheesy (except for the make-up). There were many movies out before 1987 with higher quality special effects (in fact, these were so bad that I hate to even label them as special). Finally, I've seen scarier torture scenes in other movies made both before and after this one.There was no suspense or build up of tension because I found myself laughing too often, and it wasn't even silly enough to be campy. All in all, except for the make-up (Pinhead is a scary-looking icon for a reason), this was total garbage. You want tension, rent Halloween. You want suspense with gore, rent Alien. You want suspense without gore, rent The Others. Just do yourself a favor and don't waste money on this. Extremely disappointing.

Basically the film opens up with Frank Cotton (Sean Chapman) somewhere in Morocco buying an antique Chinese puzzle box, the Lament Configuration, and solving it he unintentionally activates its power, releasing the Cenobites, extra dimensional demons who enjoy intense torture and masochism, and dissected they take him with them to their dark world. Later, his brother Larry (Dirty Harry's Andrew Robinson) arrives at the house with his second wife Julia (Clare Higgins), who had previously had an affair with Frank, while Larry's teenage daughter Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) is living in her own place, but does visit. While moving in Larry deeply cuts his hand with a nail on the wall, and a lot of his blood drops onto the floor of the attic, and somehow this blood is absorbed by one of Frank's dissected body parts, and partially restores his body and brings him back to life. Julia finds monster Frank (Oliver Smith) in the attic, and he is still obsessed with her after their previous passionate relationship, and she agrees to help him fully restore his body so they can reignite their love. To do this she starts picking up men in bars to bring them back to the house, convincing them that she wants to have sex with them, but in fact she murders them with a hammer and Frank absorbs their blood and internal organs. Kirsty coming to visit spots Julia with a man, and spying she sees one of the horrific murders, and she gets into a struggle with Frank, he is desperate for her not to touch the puzzle box which he still has, but she throws it out the window, and running away picks it up again outside and escapes. After collapsing from exhaustion Kirsty wakes up in hospital, and she solves the puzzle, summoning the Cenobites, the four demons being leader Pinhead (Doug Bradley), Chatterer (Nicholas Vince), the Female Cenobite (Grace Kirby) and Butterball (Simon Bamford). They originally plan to take her to their realm, but they agree to possibly spare her life if they can prove that Frank escaped them and is alive, and she returns to the house to find him. Her father Larry, who strangely has bloody ears, says that he has killed the monster Frank, but as he acts strangely Kirsty realises that the monster has in fact killed her father and taken his skin. In her pursuit Frank unintentionally stabs Julia with a knife, and he smiles at the fact that he killed the real Frank and has caused her emotional suffering, and this is when the Cenobites come in. They chain Frank up, piercing his body with chains, and they pull him apart, and then Pinhead and the Cenobites plan to take Kirsty with them to their hellish world, but she reverses the puzzle box and makes them all disappear. The end sees Kirsty and her boyfriend Steve (Robert Hines) throw the puzzle box onto a fire, but the strange Tramp (Frank Baker) comes in, walks into the fire, and turns into a winged demon and flies away carrying the puzzle box, and it seen back in Morocco being sold to someone else. Also starring Kenneth Nelson as Bill and Gay Baynes as Evelyn. It is an intriguing story about a dark affair reignited by violence, the disfigured dark angels from Hell are the most watchable characters, especially leader Pinhead of course, there are the great lines We'll tear your soul apart and the improvised Jesus wept!, and the make up and special effects to create the monsters and extreme bloody torture and body dismembering, that the villains enjoy, are terrific, it is an engaging masochistic horror.
