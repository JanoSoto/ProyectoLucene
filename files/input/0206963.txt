Director Christine Lahti, who won an Oscar for best short film, Lieberman in Love, concentrates on the flowering friendship between a Goth girl who needs a friend and a job and a 49 year-old haberdasher who has jettisoned everyone in order to live out his life painlessly for everyone.Jill Franklyn, who wrote the Yada Yada episode of Seinfeld, pens perfect lines for the understated Brooks, such as when he first sees Sobieski Scram. Shoo. Why don't you go get your eyeballs pierced? and another time when he says, I want the smallest tattoo you have. Can you give me a dot, or a period?Director Lahti shows her originality by letting us painfully and slowly watch a purple-haired Sobieski pull out her nose and face rings. This film is the best I have ever seen to give respect to a much-maligned paring in movies. The 17-year-old punker helps him awaken to life's interesting couplings like cavorting mannequins, and he shows her love unalloyed. When the time comes for sex, as it always does in Hollywood, no one cares, even the audience, because the point is the friendship.In the second half of the film Lahti lets go of her originality to indulge the genre with the usual fatal twist, easy reconciliation of family, and renewal for Sobieski found in a most unbelievable coincidence. Yet I can't forget that first half, where 2 human beings, unencumbered by any expectation other than their own need for connection, follow none of the formulas but love on its own terms.

Truth be told, it's because I'm middle aged white guy with a bad sense of humor and I live vicariously through Albert Brooks. Look at these character contrasts young girl-old man, freak-straight, red-gray, latte-sanka, rap-jazz, pierced/tattooed-not either. And now the similarities- two lonely relationally challenged, uncommunicative, sarcastic.that feels better. We meet a poet-eulogist Jennifer portrayed by an almost unrecognizable LeLe Sobieski. Self described as not a girl, but opposite a boy, Jennifer's self-mutilation clearly punctuates her pain. Her art is self-focused until she finds a purpose larger than herself. A Chaplin-esque Randall Harris (Albert Brooks) is introduced dressing a female mannequin. Jennifer's looking at him backward thru binoculars bothers him. This gives her perspective and the opportunity to fantasize. As their relationship develops his intentions seem noble - or repressed - and hers exploratory  - and expressed. Controversial? Only in subtext since the age difference will raise questions and eyebrows. And there's the absent father issues. Comedic elements include distorted visuals, costumes, makeup and dialogue. The relationship is treated with such sensitivity - well as much as can be expected when dealing with an alienated teen and it speaks to the emptiness we feel when we're walking around among aliens. Who do you talk to? Who are your friends? asks Randall but like most accusatory questions, he could well direct it his own way. At the end of the film, you'll find a toast to go into your repertoire. Watch for it. This quirky film is a must see for all who need a refreshing look at relationships and personal growth.

She needs a job, so she can move out of her parents' house, and he needs help in the back room sorting clothes. With her black clothes, black lipstick, black hair with purple strands, and multiple peircings, he chuckles at her and tells her to come back after she cleans up. She eventually does, she gets the job, they provide unlikely friendships for each other that each needed at that time in their lives. In the end they both gain something they needed. The film strongly implies that she wanted the relationship to a romantic one, but he learns to love her as a family member, perhaps the daughter he never had.Leelee was in two films released in 2001, this one and Joy Ride. In the latter I found her acting wooden and uninspired. However, in My First Mister she was a totally different actress, very effective, very believable. Brooks is his usual good self. John Goodman was effective as the girl's somewhat estranged and slightly off-kilter father.The DVD image is very crisp and focused. I was especially impressed with the film's lighting and camera work. The many facial close-ups are almost three-dimensional, with a soft out of focus background.

The far greater impact lies in the strength of two disparate individuals finding self-worth and importance in the existence of another who finds them attractive to be with.An older man will always find flattering the attention of an attractive (much) younger female, even if he cannot relate to her point of view on life. It helps that J is written in as witty and intelligent vs. say, something from out of Clueless.It is somewhat less believable that a Gothic teenager would find an overweight, past middle-aged man attractive - except that the reason J finds R attractive has less to do with appearance and everything to do with the level of trust and respect he shows her after some initial verbal sparring, that really is quite believable. He affords her something that she simply is not expecting. You can imagine this happening.Being accepted as you are and for who you are is the basis for all honest and lasting relationships. On this point the movie scores a bullseye.LeeLee Sobieski is a real talent. Yes, she does look like Helen Hunt, but that is where the similarity ends.Albert Brooks has always had a manner of delivering his lines as though he is making an appeal to his listener's better sense. He is a much under-appreciated comedic talent.A high recommendation for My First Mister.

She misses a father and a normal mother, since Mrs. Benson (Carol Kane) has trouble in the communication with her, and feels absolutely rejected. While looking for a job, she meets the forty-nine years old Randall Harris (Albert Brooks), a lonely man who owns a shopping store, and he hires her. They are opposites but with loneliness and lack of friends in common. They become close friends, and their interaction changes their behavior for good while secrets and feelings are disclosed.This is the second work of the excellent underrated actress Christine Lahti as director that I see (the other one is the short Lieberman in Love), and also a surprisingly great movie. The original and the Brazilian titles are simply awful and vulgar, and do not mirror this sensitive story of loneliness and friendship. Leelee Sobieski has another great performance in the role of a disturbed and rebellious teenager, needy of love and care, who changes her behavior when she meets her soul-mate friend in a middle-age man. I am not fan of Albert Brooks, but he is great performing Randall Harris, the man who touches Jennifer in the heart.

I think I'm happier that My First Mister does the climbing, even though that makes the last part of the film more trite than the glorious beginning. Some stories dig, and dig deep, but to be a 'story' at all, they have to end, not just stop, although for this film I would have chosen a less Hollywood-tied-up ending. (But I didn't invest the money in a film that needs to pay the bills).I'm glad the medium and considerable talent using it could bring me this lovingly ambiguous event.Beyond that, the film showed me a few things I enjoyed learning.From the story I especially took away the re-enforcing message that if we let our lack of boldness rule, we may be letting others down. Humility isn't thinking we have nothing to offer, or even that we might not be the only person in the world to offer it. The happiness of the rest of someone else's life may depend on us. In fact, a la It's a Wonderful Life, it probably has. Ignoring this isn't humble, it's cowardly.**SPOILER** In a mix of story and film, I thought after the great day R and J spent together that J was going to be molested, or in a car accident, to precipitate the third act with a crisis--I felt a TV moment coming on. So when we made it clear until R was late coming back from his jog (did we know he jogged?), I was actually holding out that a heart attack (turns out to be leukemia) would straight up kill him, then J would have the burden of the third act entirely in her court (Sobieski could have handled it), say, by having to do all the things a wife does after her husband's death while being treated as a child by ambulance personnel, funeral home director, clergy, et al. Think of the scene where she wants to dress R's body but is pushed away by funeral home people, and so can only leave a piercing stud attached to his clothes--an icon of her lonely youth used as a symbol of her maturing love. Her kiss from death would play out in a social role she wanted, but was not accepted in, in ironic juxtaposition to how she had imagined it playing out beyond any (accepted) social roles. And the scene where she almost but doesn't cut herself, and breaks down in shoulder-shaking sobs, and her mother shows up at her partially-open apartment door with food, hears her, and enters into the darkness, crossing into her own acceptance of the other side of life.But, the TV moment came...by comparison, listen to the deleted scene commentaries for Passionada--if only My First Mister had gotten the same chance at a new third act... Perhaps I'm learning that our imagined endings are still valid. Who's to say that we can't enjoy a film because of where it pointed us, even if it didn't really go there?As for the strictly film aspects, I still dislike non-standard dissolves popping up in the last one-third of a film, especially if it isn't strictly romantic comedy. Why, in such a delicate film, would an editor do something like that? But in the last supper scene the apparent discontinuity, then toast, then fading of individuals were inspiring. Did J really give that toast? To follow hinted continuity (R and Nurse Patty had already moved to the sofa, though they could have returned) she didn't, or perhaps she did, but it wasn't really like that...such a beautiful suggestion of how we remember those evenings that were too good to be true in the face of realities too bad to accept.A hole well dug, even if I didn't dig the whole as much as I might have.

I had just assumed this would be another Hollywood schlock-fest featuring the dry humor of Albert Brooks and Leelee Sobieski attempting to reconnect with a teenie-bopper audience. I was wrong. This was such a strong film that dedicated itself to developing strong characters, to giving us honest emotions, and providing us a story that is not unfamiliar in the real world that it nearly left my jaw hanging on the ground. From the opening moments in which we are focused directly on the life of Jennifer (aka J) to the unrecognizable change to following Randall (aka R) My First Mister will make you laugh, make you cry, and make you realize that friendship is stronger than the clothes you wear or the amount of piercings on you face. Through the use of Brooks' every man persona and Sobieski's attention to detail with her character, this film gives us a rare glimpse into Lahti's near-perfect film.What initially pulled me into this film was the untraditional Hollywood story that scribe Jill Franklyn unfolds before us. I assumed, prior to watching the film that this was going to be a sexual film mocking the taboos of age in our society. From the completely baffling byline, one could only assume that we were about to experience an early version of Thirteen, but Lahti and Franklyn do something rather unexpected. The idea of sex is placed in front of us early in the film and prior to the climax, but it isn't the central focus. By building this film around the premise of friendship instead of sex, Lahti creates a unique and poignant film about other cultural taboos in our society. She eliminates the idea of sex and gives us two strong-willed characters that, perhaps in another life, may have had a sexual relationship, but now are just seeking companionship and comfort. What brings a smile to my face with this story is the way that it is developed. Lahti nearly teases us with the idea of a sexual story several times, but instead builds a solid foundation around friendship. She makes us, the audience, feel as if we are meeting two friends for the first time. By eliminating sex, she pulls us deeper within the characters allowing us to see the true love that is obviously between these visual opposites. I use the word visual because we do not believe their connection at first because of the clothes that they wear. A Goth girl befriends Mr. Rogers? Society would tell us that this could never happen, but the Lahti persuades us by giving us two of the strongest characters to play against each other in modern cinematic history.I realize that others would argue that there have been stronger matching in Hollywood long before Brooks and Sobieski, which I would agree of classic Hollywood, but recently (basically 80s to present) it is hard to find two actors that seem to compliment each other like a great cheese and aged red wine. Sobieski dove, head first, into her character giving J mannerisms and characteristics that seemed pure and researched. I felt as if Sobieski was one of those misunderstood Goths that I had class with in school. From the poetry, the eye movements when speaking, and the overall self-abusive negativity that she has against herself as well as those around her. She patiently waits for the right person to enter her insane life and finds that with Brooks. For those seeking his typical sarcasm and wry attitude, My First Mister may disappoint. Albert Brooks contains himself in this film. He does so to the point that midway through the feature I forgot that it was funnyman Brooks. He amazingly transforms himself into an older version, in a khaki color, of J. The two play so well off each other that as an audience member you have the chance to enjoy both the acting as well as a very strongly developed story about family and friendship.I have talked about the story, I have talked about the characters, but none of this would have been possible if it were not for the brilliant direction behind the camera and the talented eye of minimal director Christine Lahti. At first I was unsure of how well she would be able to handle such a deeply emotional topic, if she would cliché the characters and fill their mouths with remedial dialogue that would be painful to both the eyes and ears, but instead she remained calm, cool, and completely collective throughout the entire film. It was obvious that she had done her homework prior to each scene and before each take. She had the control of her actors, which developed into some great on-screen chemistry, as well as she knew how to tactfully take us to the next emotional level. Sure, it wasn't perfect (the ending seemed a bit tattered), but Lahti remained focused and even cleverly changed the focus throughout the film with the greatest of ease. I was surprised to see that Lahti has not directed more after this project, because it was obvious that her talent was behind the camera.Overall, I thought My First Mister was a sensational film. We had a superb cast that complimented each other so well that we could easily forget that we were watching a film. We had a story that spoke emotionally and socially about friendship and family on more than just a June Cleaver level. Finally, we had a director that was not afraid to take risks and do her homework. This story works on so many levels that to begin to unravel it would take more time than allowed. I suggest this film strongly because it will make you think twice about passing judgment on someone due to their clothes or piercing habits, who knows where friendship could erupt!

The material she has chosen would make for an interesting ABC Afterschool Special movie, but the quality of the writing certainly demands less talent than Albert Brooks and LeeLee Sobieski, who strain to reduce the amount of schmaltz and syrup written for them and flesh out well-rounded characters.  I think the story is a very good one, and some judicious re-writing would have made a world of difference.  For example, little time is spent in exposition for the character of Randall, who though portrayed as boring and staid, has a rather deep inner life with regret over his marriage breakup and a secret he keeps hidden from everyone, and more situations could have been written to introduce his character.  The movie centers around Jennifer, and Randall's introduction seems done only as a device to add plot to Jennifer's character study.  If you have a teenage daughter, it might be a good idea to see this movie with her.  I know lots of girls from high school and college who could have used a hero like Jennifer, who in the end lets go of her gothic pretensions and finds real love.

For me, Mary Kay's character will always be partly Meg from `Big Chill,' and she will always be looking for some noble man to impregnate her without penalty. Hope she got her kid this time around, because she plays precisely the same medical personage. Must have been because the director didn't know what she wanted and just asked for something the actor already had.Carol Kane does her squeeky frenetic character here, as well as she has done elsewhere. In my mind, I will remember her for `Annie Hall,' Muppet Movie,' and Princess Bride,' and forget these later transgressions.Ted's Evaluation 1 of 4 you probably can find something better to do with this part of your life.IMDB 4 "},{"Title":"two good characters","Date":"13 March 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Jennifer Wilson (Leelee Sobieski) is a goth misfit and a loner at school.

She strikes up a relationship with Randall (Albert Brooks), an elderly store manager. Both characters are struggling to find their niche in contemporary society.Films in which troubled young women fall in love with, and learn life lessons from, older men are a dime a dozen. Mister itself eventually degenerates into clichés and contrivances. Before it does, though, it offers a number of wonderful little moments. Sobieski and Brooks are both infectious as a couple of lonely hearts, and the film, possibly because it was written (Jill Franklyn) and directed (Christine Lahti) by women, avoids the creepy, paedophillic vibes associated with the genre.7.9/10 &#x96; Despite its woeful final act, Mister is a strong drama featuring (the oft typecast) Sobieski in one of her best performances.

A total misfit, she's as wacky as a teenager can be. Goth-ed out with multiple piercings, tattoos, and dyed hair, she listens to strange music, watches vintage TV, eats primarily chocolate, and self injures. But now high school is over and she needs a job. In an effort to secure employment at the upscale Century City Mall in Los Angeles, Jennifer, a 17-year-old goth-punk, makes a nuisance of herself at a clothing store run by 49-year-old Randall Harris (Brooks), who eventually hires her on a trial basis as a stockroom clerk. Jennifer refers to herself simply as J, and thus asks Randall if it's okay if she calls him R, to which he accedes and this is the beginning of a weird relationship.The first half of the movie is very quirky, charming and intriguing. The two actors are wonderful in their roles and make us believe in the setting. The tone feels real in the beginning and the added touch of her school being a jungle, literally, adds a dark humour to the proceedings. Feeling isolated from the other people in her life, J finds she is somehow slowly attracted to a beer bellied Randall. The first signs of stupidity reared up its ugly head when ridiculously beautiful women were falling head over heels for this homely man who had no discernible attractive traits and weren't making another appearance, save for one lady. This had to be a strong point since jealousy, or some lower iteration of it, was a major point for Jennifer to fall for this guy and it was done horribly.Society loves to wag their fingers and act judgmental when an older person who isn't family is out with a younger kid. They don't think that they could just be friends. While the feelings between Randall and Jennifer were understandable, it just didn't feel authentic since the very basis of their relationship was contrived and flawed. Then it went to sappy melodrama with Randall having a life threatening disease and a son (played by a young Quinn from Dexter) as well. The ending was gloriously asinine with none of the adults actually caring that their teenage daughter and this middle aged man were in some sort of a very visible relationship and went a step further with Randall advising his son to take care of Jennifer. If it hadn't completely gone off the rails before, well it did now. The movie has its charms, but its manipulative and flawed.5/10 "},{"Title":"Leaves you feeling content, although teary","Date":"28 August 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  *Mild spoilers*This movie is one people will have many criticisms for if they don't step back and take a long, hard look at it.I love the relationship elegantly written into this story. I see many people taking it for a romance, but J and R have very, very different feelings for each other. It's plain that J has deep feelings for R. They are both the only people the other feels close to. However, what he is looking for is not a replacement for his wife, but someone he can pass his time with.The gem of this movie is the way R makes J reconsider things. He openly challenges her clothes and image, and from then on I believe she has a respect for him. No one else has questioned her before; everyone just looks at her and quickly looks away. Immediately she wants his attention, and he is willing (and wanting) to befriend her through all their differences. And J evolves so much through R. She wanted so badly for someone to try and understand her. After she had that person, she let down her guard and a lot of her resentment.I have to admit that there were many clichés in this movie.

That R had an illness that he kept a secret was important to the story. It explained why his wife left him (even she didn't know). It explained why he shunned people for years. It was also an important part of the story because he used the secret to betray J. Earlier she lost his trust by making the bizarre window display. We were made to think that R, being older and wiser, wouldn't do such a thing to her. But he made an even greater breach of trust by not telling her this secret, even though she had told him all of hers and they had earlier agreed to not keep secrets from each other.

Albert Brooks was engaging also.  Together, they create the great chemistry needed to propel this movie forward.  The supporting cast, the screenplay and direction, the scenes, are all incredibly done. Why wasn't this movie a box office smash?  If My Big Fat Greek Wedding grew on people, why didn't this?  One of the best drama/comedies ever written.This movie did a great job developing what would normally be an unlikely bond between the spunkiness of youth with the set-in-my-ways old. But it was the excellence and creativeness of the script and the excellent direction that helped propel My First Mister into the superb column.  Dan Decker, author of Anatomy of a Screenplay, has always insisted on a character driven story and each starring and major supporting role was given substance and character development.  I know some people feel as though drawing emotion from the viewer is somewhat cliched, (as we watched the relationship between Leelee and Albert Brooks begin to weaken), but to me that's just one of the elements that's used to make great movies.  Why can't the screenwriter create heart-wrenching scenes and not be written off as cliched or creating a sympathetic ploy?  As far as I'm concerned, it helped carry the movie to a satisfying but emotional ending.  Might I also add any deviation from drawing real-life emotion from Leelee's character, Jennifer, would have turned this movie into a farce.  In real life you cannot build a relationship as touching as the one they had and walk away unmoved.  My hat comes off in respect to Christine Lahti, the director, and to Jill Franklyn, the writer.This is a must-see movie!  Do not deprive yourself of the opportunity.An equally engaging movie was Ghost World.  In both movies you get to know the two main characters very well.

Worth watching overall.","Date":"30 October 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  (SPOILER-FREE)Like a lot of folks I rented this on Albert Brooks' name alone.  His movies usually strike me in a funny place that others don't reach, or even try to reach. And MY FIRST MISTER did, too -- but as others have noted, there's more drama than comedy here.The meat of the movie for me -- the part I even played again the next day, to enjoy it a second time -- was the first hour.  Watching the two lead characters meet and connect in some unexpected ways was consistently interesting, sometimes delightful, and sometimes downright moving.  The movie respects its characters, and we get a story which largely feels like it comes right from them and not dictated by the needs of a Hollywood formula.  For once I was actually interested in what the heck would happen to these two people on the screen.  Brooks deserves a lot of credit for grounding this thing and making it understated and real.  God knows I'm biased about the guy, but he really does a good job -- the writer should give him a big bear hug, God bless him.  His chemistry with Sobieski is strong and they carry the material well.  Oh yeah, she's good, too, by the way. )The first hour could easily be imagined as a very good short story.  So what happens then? I'll only say that at that point, the plot takes a new direction, and the remaining part of the movie is on the threshold of melodrama -- a bit too much and too often for my taste.   While the magic of the earlier parts relied on the interaction of two individuals, and was to some good extent outside Hollywood conventions, the later parts involve some (weaker) ensemble stuff, and maybe tend to follow Hollywood's tendency for closure and emotional wrap-ups.  Moreover, there's a pall of maudlin in the later parts that I found hard to take.  (But it could be that like J. in the movie, I'm not that good with emotions and stuff, I don't know.  Your mileage may vary.)In any case the good will earned by the performers and story carried me through it, and I was happy to have seen this movie.

I love Albert Brooks, and I consider him a king of the one-liners.  He is hysterically funny comedian, and I expected to watch a hysterically funny film.  Well, Albert plays it straight this time around, though he occasionally blurts out a dry one-liner.  The movie opens on a dark note, introducing us into the gothic world of our main character Jennifer (Leelee Sobieski).  Now, I was very tuned in at first, because I'm familiar with quite a few gothic chicks, and Leelee's character was not at all far from the real thing.  Then she meets a grumpy store manager (Albert Brooks) and little by little, they generate a real friendship.  Though he is more wealthy and successful than Jennifer, he also doesn't know what path to take in life.  They both have spent so much time hiding behind their masks that they are just beginning to find out who they really are and what they really want.  Both Brooks and Sobieski give very credible performances, and the idea of two polar opposites generating a true bond is intense and thought-provoking.  As I often say, there are not enough movies that delve into the true meaning of friendship.  And I'm always proud to see a movie that does.  And another thing I appreciated--the two characters don't end up sleeping together!  That is a cheap shot that the average filmmaker would resort to, just to get an Oooooh out of the audience.  ************SPOILERS AHEAD********************Now what I didn't like about this movie?.....it later sinks down to corny TV movie conventions.  We find out that Brooks is days (not months or years, but days!) away from dying.  Sure, it's sad.  Sure, my eyes got watery when Leelee saw his body laying collapsed on the street.  But in the back of my mind, I knew what was going on in the heads of the screenwriters  Why don't we have his character reveal a deadly illness and eventually die?  I guess they felt there wasn't enough drama, so they piled on more drama and more drama until it transforms into melodrama.  Then we have the purely predictable scene in which Leelee visits the house of Brooks's long lost son.  Like in all these movies, the son completely snubs any thought of uniting with his father.  Why does he eventually meet his father?  Because the screenwriters made it so that Leelee had problems starting her car when about the leave the son's house.  So he decides, Sure, I'll give ya a ride, but I'm not gonna talk to my father.  Well, he gives her a ride and he approaches his Dad with no hesitation.  By the end of the film, everyone in Leelee's family--parents, stepparents and all--sit together at the dinner table, laughing it up.  And my final complaint is Leelee's character transformation.  Now, I'm a stickler when it comes to character transformations, because I don't believe people change that easily--I'm not being cynical, it's a fact.  I can believe that meeting this older man is able to influence a change in Jennifer's life, but not to the point where she gets rid of ALL her piercings, develops a love for everyone (whereas in the beginning she hated everyone, including herself), communicates openly with her parents and becomes an altogether magnificent person. This really could've been a great film if it weren't for some stilted dialogue and a third act that belongs on the small screen in a Lifetime Movie of the Week.  But it's still a good film with good intentions and good performances.  If you want to see Albert Brooks show his serious side and flaunt his considerable dramatic chops, then it's worth a look.  But don't make the same mistake I did and assume you're about to watch Lost in America or The Muse.  There's a few moments of comic relief, but it's a straight drama.

"},{"Title":"Memorable Film from Christine Lahti","Date":"29 April 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  	Among the many and myriad young actresses making movies today, there has unequivocally emerged a Fantastic Four, and they are  Natalie Portman, Anna Paquin, Kirsten Dunst and Leelee Sobieski.  And the one who is arguably the leader of the pack, Leelee Sobieski, takes on the starring role here, in `My First Mister,' a story of two very different people, of different generations, both of whom are alone in the world (though in different ways and for different reasons), and who ultimately find what they need in one another-- and without even consciously looking for it.  Directed by Christine Lahti, It's a study, not only of human nature, but of the expansiveness and resiliency of the human spirit and of the heart, and how it is possible for two people to defy category and definition, and intuitively reach out to one another by allowing fate, or destiny-- or whatever you want to call it-- to take them beyond the parameters set by society, where-- as in this case-- they are able to find fulfillment in it's purest sense.  It's a revised chapter taken from the age-old book of The Human Comedy, updated to a contemporary setting to illustrate that now as much as ever, no man is an island; that everyone needs someone, that there is someone for everyone and, moreover, that one will instinctively seek out that kindred soul, often finding him in the most unlikely of places.	Jennifer (Sobieski) is an unhappy teen; she's adopted a goth look and lifestyle, embraces her autonomy, but in so doing has alienated just about everybody around her, including-- or perhaps especially-- her immediate family.  she simply cannot relate to her mother, Sylvie (Carol Kane), who seems perpetually mired in the &#145;50s (her appearance and attitude part of her own defense mechanisms and survival tactics), or her step-father, Bob (Michael McKean), a nondescript individual who is just...there.	What Jennifer longs for is a place of her own, which she equates (albeit subconsciously) to independence, and toward that end she begins looking for the gainful employment that will enable her to achieve her immediate goal.  And it is during her job search that she encounters Randall (Albert Brooks), the manager of a men's clothing store.	Necessity may be the proverbial mother of invention, but here it becomes the driving force that makes the connection between two people who-- if not for that necessity-- would never have known the other existed.  As it turns out, however, due to some quite personal circumstances and reasons of his own, Randall is something of a singular individual, and is able to see beyond Jennifer's outward appearance and attitude, and agrees to give her a job on a trial basis.  And it's the beginning of a unique relationship that will ultimately change both of their lives forever, and in ways that neither of them could possibly have imagined.	This is the first feature film that Lahti-- a fine actor herself-- has directed, and she does an exemplary job with it.  She knows her characters and the emotional terrain with which she is dealing, and subtly fills the story as it unfolds with pathos and poignancy, which she delivers with care and sensitivity.  Lahti has an eye for emotional detail and, perhaps due to her own extensive acting background, knows how to extract the precise sentiment she's endeavoring to express from her actors.  And because of the way it's presented, when the story takes an unexpected turn, the transition is so seamless it comes across as entirely real and convincing, which of course gives it credibility, and makes it believable.  Lahti has a gentle touch tempered with a restraint, and it gives her film a natural flow and a rhythm that draws in the viewer and makes for a satisfying and involving experience.	Complementing Lahti's style, and assuring the success of this film, are the wonderful performances by Sobieski and Brooks.  Sobieski runs an emotional gamut in this film, and she does it with a poise and maturity beyond her years, making her journey from disenfranchised goth at the beginning of the film, to the individual she is at the end, plausible and convincing.  She manages to convey all of the emotional layers of her character, which enables the viewer to relate to the complexities of who this young woman is and what she's feeling, which-- since this is a character driven story-- is integral to the overall success of the film.  And Sobieski makes it so, with a memorable performance.	A big part of the credit for the film's success has to go to Albert Brooks, as well.  As he does here with Randall, Brooks has an innate ability to create a character that is so normal, so average-guy-on-the-street, that it adds that total sense of reality to the film.  It's the little things that Brooks does so well, and that make all the difference; he gives the audience someone with whom they can truly empathize and identify, because he so succinctly manages to express all the affecting elements of everyday life-- the minutiae of day-to-day existence, as well as the corresponding emotions-- through his characters, and it's why you're going to remember Randall for a long, long time.  Like Ben Stiller, Brooks has a straightforward, often wry delivery that works so well, and which he uses to great effect.  And it certainly serves him well here.	The supporting cast includes Desmond Harrington (Randy), Mary Kay Place (Patty), Kevin Cooney (Doctor), William Forward (Customer) and Lisa Jane Persky (Sheila).  An entertaining, well crafted and delivered film that promises one thing and ends up giving much more, `My First Mister,' in the final analysis, is an engaging story that goes deep and touches the heart, and without any maudlin sentimentality attached.  Ultimately a transporting experience, this is one that will take you to a place you'll want to be, and you'll be glad you took the journey.  And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.

Not that there's anything wrong with either approach; in `Ghost World' we're visitors, watching.  In `My First Mister', we're participants, feeling.  This movie is what really good filmmaking is all about; a story about real people we care about, doing things we identify with, presented in a way that touches us. Christine Lahti, where have you been!  Leelee Sobieski plays a seventeen year old heavy metal high school graduate loner who is unable to connect with anyone, except her dead grandmother--there's hope!   Her performance is sadly lost, almost unnoticed in a year of so many superb movies and performances.  In just about any other year I can think of, Leelee's work here would have certainly resulted in an Oscar nomination. J. latches onto a most unlikely hero, that is for a teenage girl with tattoos.  He is Randall Harris--or R., as J. likes to call him--played by Albert Brooks in the strongest performance of his career, a haberdasher in an upscale store in Century City.  What everyone learns from J. and R.'s relationship is something you'll have to discover from watching the movie yourself.  Paramount Pictures marketed `My First Mister' as an `art' film, receiving limited promotion and release.

The film is sweet, funny, and only mildly sappy at its conclusion.  Sobieski is far better here than I have ever seen her not only is her normal wooden persona fit the character well at the onset, but she exhibits an impressive range as the character grows throughout the film.  Albert Brooks is superb, really the best he's been in a long, long time.  The love between these two unlikely characters (a 17-year-old goth chick and a 49-year-old clothing store owner) is handled delicately, lovingly, and not at all timidly.  The script is carefully crafted and allows for more than the safe platonic relationship without resorting to the shocking physical relationship that so many other films give into in the misguided hopes of being daring or original. 	There is so much to like about the first two thirds of this film that it is almost a shame when it appears to devolve into a conventional, terminal illness, you've taught me so much heart-string-puller.  Even this is handled far better than it could have been, and much of this credit must go to director Christine Lahti.  The final dinner scene with Sobieski, her family, and Brooks - after a brief flirtation with cheesiness - is wrenchingly heartfelt and real.This is one of the better films that you will see before the onslaught of quality Oscar-grubbing event films later in the fall.

In the film's first half, isolated goth leelee lifts an entertaining finger to her family, school and the world. Sure, everything is exaggerated to make a point, so it isn't at all realistic. Also, she's such a sweetie, even in the darkest moments no room for the real world of genuinely dislikeable people. Her absent father from hell is John Goodman, hardly a credible hate figure. Her problem of course is no-one understands her - she even talks to her dead grandmother for company. Of course, she falls like a brick for the first nice person she comes across (older man with moustache and other issues). So, typical problems, lacking all realism and laid on with a shovel. Still, all great fun, as she cocks a snook at the world with some great one liners and you forgive the surrealism, a bit like Desperately Seeking Susan.Where it all goes pear shaped is in part II, where she on a whim or two rapidly gets a job, has a great boss, cleans up, gets a flat, brings a family together, finds a nice boyfriend, comforts a dying man and reconciles with her family. As there is no inherent drama or observation of reality, the sudden lurch into motherhood, apple pie and family values becomes a simple homily. Hasn't this director read Voltaire's Candide?

Some have managed to make a name in their new profession, such as Sydney Pollack, Clint Eastwood and Richard Benjamin. Mel Gibson seems well on his way.Then there are those who seem to (as yet) have had a one off fling. The results in these cases are usually interesting. The classic example would be Charles Laughton's famous Night of the Hunter. In later days, two overlooked fine movies come to mind with Kevin Spacey's Albino Alligator and Matt Dillon's City of Ghosts.In the light of this it was with a fair sense of curiosity that I approached Christine Lahti's My First Mister.The movie starts off in a bold indie style, with oddball characters introduced over a raunchy soundtrack. All bodes well for this tale of the unlikely friendship between two very different characters, who manage to connect despite these differences, not the least being the vast age gap. It naturally recalls Ghost World, but then the unexpected begins to unfold.Lahti completely loses confidence in what was clearly a pose in the first place. The indie quality vanishes before our eyes and is gradually usurped by a television sensibility melodrama. It's an awful let down.Albert Brooks gives a fine portrayal while Leelee Sobieski starts off well, but like the movie, her performance degenerates.The major flaw of the movie is lack of concept. A director has to have a firm, assured concept and bring that to fruition. Lahti greenness as a first time director is stamped all over My First Mister.

Antisocial 17-year-old girl, into Goth attire, facial piercings, and suicide notes (and, in the completely off-putting first scene, smearing her own blood across her handwritten poetry), cleans herself up and gets a job in the stockroom of a local men's clothing store; there, she befriends her middle-aged boss, who doesn't have any friends either. Christine Lahti made her feature directorial debut here, and the scenario is littered with celebrity friends and (for the most part) a good-natured air. Some of the early visual jokes do not work at all, though Lahti is very adept at setting up intimate conversational moments. Her film would seem to share a common thread with the later Lost in Translation, but--by focusing most of the attention on the ill-tempered, foul-mouthed teenager (Leelee Sobieski, dressed like a sewer rat)--interest in the central relationship takes an awfully long time to build. Albert Brooks is rather adorable in cardigan sweaters and a natty mustache, but Brooks does more for the movie than it does for him. By the halfway mark, the picture has sunk into a vat of mushy sentiment, clichés, and scenes lifted from other (better) movies and television shows. ** from **** "},{"Title":"I Admit I Didn't Finish Watching It...","Date":"29 May 2008","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" ... so I can't really rate it.

Otherwise the movie is painfully dull, kind of like the knife J uses to cut herself.I will say that the friendship that arises between J and her boss is somewhat interesting. Nonetheless, I watched this movie on a Tivo and found myself wanting to fast forward not only through the commercials, but through the movie as well. I would recommend that only individuals with a very high tolerance for angsty, attention-seeking teenage characters watch this motion picture.

Key to the execution of the writer's ambitious vision were the touching performances by Albert Brooks and Leelee Sobieski in the two main roles.The movie is focused more on the teen-aged girl's point of view as she tries to pull middle-aged Albert Brook's character into her world, which is an interesting way to go but not very believable. Albert Brooks shines in an understated way.The movie lets down a bit after the first 113 and should have been shorter. The movie has too many characters that remain undeveloped throughout the movie, features an unfortunate plot twist at the end involving a relative Albert Brooks' character didn't know existed, and offers strange elements that detract from the movie's realism (e.g., the I see dead people facet and Caspar the friendly wife quirk--the purpose of the latter being completely lost on me). I think two love interests were introduced merely to remove any lingering ideas the viewer may have about the nature of the characters' relationship, which we are assured is platonic. I thought the moral of accepting of other people as they are could have been underlined a bit more in place of the unnecessary plot turns.The film's worth watching for the story idea and for the performances of Brooks and Sobieski. I'm glad I didn't see it in the theater because I would've embarrassed myself.

However, this is one of the most cliched indie films I have seen in my life.  The story involves a man who is dying, not a big surprise, and so he can't keep anyone close to him (cliche #1).  The girl of course falls hopelessly in love with him (cliche #2).  But its all okay in the end because he decides to accept her friendship (cliche #3).  The girl then falls in love with the son of the main character (cliche #4).  The list can go on.  I will give the stars credit because they are both interesting (as opposed to some of their other work).  Leelee looks like a silent movie star and makes her gothic character beautiful and dark at the same time, which was the whole point.  I think that the people involved forgot that most kids just do it for the fashion. I think the movie would've been more funny if it didn't love its characters so much.  I do like when Albert Brooks' character takes stabs at the girl, because she thinks she is so different from other people, but she really isn't.  I like the movie but if it had been more self depreciating it would've become one of my favorites.  But what do I know?  If you like interesting romantic movies, then I'd recommend this for you.

Two lonely souls with apparently polar opposite attitudes share one important aspect of their existence - the need for a concrete connection with another consciousness. Both have deliberately withdrawn from the trite banalities of pop culture and the superficial facade of social interaction. While 'popular' kids pick on and pity such loners in highschool- labeling them outcasts lacking social graces - many who withdraw and avoid the masses do so not out of fear but from strength. It is this conscious contempt and willful independance which truly testifies to one's personal fortitude and integrity. It takes more courage to be alone and dignified, than to pick the path with the white picket fence or follow the other sheep to Starbucks and the Gap. So it goes for our two heroes. Neither 'fits' in anywhere, so each has turned that turmoil inward - Jennifer (J) has gone Goth, erected walls, and mutilated her epidermis, while Randall (R) has resorted to reclusivity amongst magazines and nostalgia. These are not shallow, one-dimentional characters like Lost Angeles and celluloid are laden with, rather the duo are deep, deftly defined personas with definite counterparts in waking life.J and R have undeniable chemistry, as beakers of banter overflow and worlds collide in a jumble of verbal jabs with an underscore of genuine emotion. Amazing acting by Brooks and Sobiesky anchor the story as the axis the plot spins around. You don't just suspend disbelief in a movie like this, you fall into their artificial world of familiarity, friendship, and simple interaction. You still might not want to hang out with them, yet you'll root for them, feel for them, grow to like and respect them. and while the latter half of the movie descends into cliche, the first hour and the ideas therein is a really beautiful thing.

(Dir Christine Lahti)Albert Brooks is one of my all-time favorite funny men with his trademark brainy schmuck trying to win the heart of a pretty woman by deflating his own ego and wallowing in self-deprecation misery in the process.  His films from the late 1970s and early 80s belong in a time capsule and rank only second to Woody Allen in capturing urbane angst and anomie brilliantly yet with a bubbling of sentimentality beneath its scathing surface.  His career has been peppered with some brilliant work as a supporting actor in other filmmakers' projects most notably in James L. Brooks' screwball potshot at romance in the media in the classic Broadcast News where Brooks portrayed a discontented, smart newsman trying to win over his gal pal Holly Hunter for haircut in a blazer on air anchor William Hurt in the process and giving one for the archives the definition of flop sweat anxiety in his one-shot at filling in as a weekend anchor with disastrous results.  Brooks copped a Best Supporting Actor nomination in 1987 (ultimately losing to Sean Connery for his career capper in The Untouchables).  Don't count him out for a nom this year either in his latest outing.Sobieski (arguably the most talented if not ubiquitous Generation Y actresses today) stars as a malcontent teenager named Jennifer Wilson, who masks her disdain for suburban L.A. in her all-black clad ensemble and post-Goth haircut (with trendy purple streakings) and pallid pallor replete with chains, Doc Martens and a suicidal fetish that is borderline Sylvia Plathian (she has The Bell Jar on her nightstand).  A rebel with nothing to rebel against except her well-meaning yet embarrassing mother (Kane) and schnook stepfather (Keaton in a ridiculous combover) and a not-too-bright future in a world where all the pretty girls get whatever they can wiggle their little finger at.  Of course she's depressed.  And being a virgin doesn't help.So Jennifer decides to try finding a job and after a nice montage of her getting ousted from practically every Century City plaza boutique she plops her dark self in front of a ritzy men's haberdashery and spies a stout, moustachioed fellow in the store's window display affixing nude mannequins (one of the connecting metal pins is a rectal job) for the latest sale (enter Brooks, looking like a cross between a dyspeptic yet thinner Oliver Hardy with his soup-strainer, Charlie Chaplin due to his modified curly top and Alex Trebek).  Jennifer ventures in and asks about the help wanted sale featured and after some reluctance she is given a shot as a stock room girl by the owner Randall Harris (Brooks, pay attention) who she quickly nicknames R and J to her by he.What follows is a remarkably natural progression of smart dialogue by two parallel characters sharing one trademark loneliness.  Each despite their age differences (he's 49 and she is 17) are clearly soul mates in the romantic sense but not in the sexual (at least for all intense and purposes it is only hinted at with some hilarious moments particularly when J asks R upfront if he wants to f**k her and he promptly chokes on his Sanka in her dank coffeehouse hang-out as the co-workers try to unwind).  J compliments R and vice versea in changing their appearances, learning some life lessons and generally loving one another for who they are and not how they look. Both performances are lovingly structured and assuredly directed by actress Lahti (best known as the ballsy tall drink of water of the late, great TV drama Chicago Hope and an Oscar winner for a short film a few years back to boot) who lets her two principals play their May/December romance with touching poignancy and utter hilarity thanks to a sharp hewed script by Jill Franklyn (who scribed the Yada Yada Seinfeld episode) that allows Sobieski to do some fine emoting from dark humor to genuine grief and Brooks becoming a better character actor as well as some fine moments of wry commentary. The only speed bump is a setback involving a health issue that I don't want to spoil for the audience but be forewarned that the comedy still remains intact from the treacly trappings. Sobieski, with her oval face and appearance a hybrid of Meryl Streep, Joan Cusack and her doppelganger Helen Hunt, also is a smart actress who always appears smarter than the material but here both are balanced with nuance and verve and she's barely recognizable under her Halloween getups in the beginning suggesting Winona Ryder's look in Beetlejuice and a jaundiced Wednesday Addams; her inner sweetness belies the tortured soul.The supporting cast of comedic vets do well too although Goodman's turn as J's hippie-gone-to-seed dad is a bit much and Kane's sunny ditz mom rises above a cartoon prototype. Again it is Brooks who truly surprises as his sad sack R looking rumpled under his custom fit clothing and attempting to save himself while saving J from herself.  It's a thing of joyous melancholy.

It did make me laugh a few times, but the ending is obvious, drawn out and, and saccharine-sweet, as the film loses its previous spikiness in favour of a meaningless, conformist message, a quick weep and a feel-good glow.

Father That's okay... I failed your mother.If this is the kind of cute exchange that gets you all mushy-gushy, then dig in. After all, SOMEONE must have been created to enjoy this pathetic pap. This scene was also meant to be funny - but in a SWEET way. Please, someone... make space, I gotta rush to the loo... MFM is one of those tear-jerker comedies, the worst sub-genre there is. Predictably, nothing here is funny, nothing is cute, and the only tears that left my little head were the huge drops that formed themselves under my eyes as I repeatedly yawned, wondering if something of quality would EVER pass by the screen. In the end, as Sobieski sobbed for a record 48th time, I broke wind and that was pretty much the highest quality - of anything - that came anywhere near my TV set during that not-so-fateful viewing.My First Mister, with a title that is just as embarrassing to read as much of the dialog here is embarrassing/unbearable to listen to, is a desperate cross between Hollywood formula schmaltz, French generation-gap sex-romp male fantasy, plus a small amount of that supposedly deep indie movie genre with the unsuccessful touches of quirkiness-for-the-sake-of-it that usually go along with that sort of thing. MFM takes the worst elements of these anyway mostly bad genres, and serves you a product you can't real eat to. MFM is something to vomit to, hence if you wanna prepare a meal to accompany this film, you'd better count on that food leaving your body just as soon as you swallow it. MFM is NOT a quirky indie movie by any means. It is predictable, totally unoriginal sweetititity nonsense, full of overly melodramatic, sentimental plot-devices such as a TV-movie-of-the-week sudden fatal disease outbreak. Fat Al is dying, people, so let's all get those tissues! And guess what else he is too noble too take advantage of a 17 year-old that comes on to him OUT OF THE BLUE. Yeah, I guess MFM was meant to target lonely middle-aged housewives who are trying to waste time between two Amanda Quick novels, but also middle-aged men who have just entered a midlife crisis hence are starting to have dreams about young and willing teenage girls... Brooks is also so very predictably brave about dying - aren't we all?? Those Tinseltown weepers and their perpetually brave dying characters... I'm touched. I would have given this movie four more stars if only Brooks had screamed I don't wanna die!!!! at the top of his lungs. A bit more realism hence unpredictability, please.One of the many annoying aspects is that for most of the movie all the side-characters are cardboard caricatures. McKean is wasted as a tight-a** suit-and-tie guy, Kane plays an overly ditsy and manic mother, Goodman is the dumb aging hippie, etc... None of them have any credibility, hence are neither funny nor real - or at the very least belong to a different kind of comedy than this, perhaps a screwball comedy. It is as though these absurd characters invaded the set of MFM by leaving the set of a very bad sitcom. (But that'd be like leaving one sinking ship for another.) The lesser, one-appearance-only, characters are even dumber the woman that rents out apartments is swayed by the most ridiculous story Brooks cooks up (hence totally unfunny); Sobieski sells a suit to a store customer who also acts like an utter imbecile, and so on. This movie does justice to no-one in its cast except perhaps Brooks, who is anyway an overrated, unfunny slob. He belongs in this dull turd. At times I had a feeling as if Brooks was trying to walk in Robin Williams's footsteps, when he played all those terrible, totally pathetic pity-me-please-weep-for-me-please characters. Goodman, on the other hand, is wasted, making a fool of himself as Leelee's free-spirit father. Talk about moronic casting... Leelee plays a know-it-all (i.e. dumb) Gruftie (Goth chick) kid with suicidal tendencies. She is spoiled, she is confused, arrogant-yet-insecure, and we are supposed to like her. Worse yet, the makers of MFM are so out-of-touch with music fashions that Sobieski listens not to Type O Negative, Danzig, or the Smashing Pumpkins, but some ultra-commercial chewing-gum pop which she proudly presents to Brooks in of the movie's many cretinous scenes. In spite of its glaring flaws, the first 15-20 minutes were at least semi-watchable. However, as time passes it becomes quite apparent that the script has nowhere to go. It was obvious the two would not have sex, hence much of the middle is about dull, supposedly insightful conversations between the fat loser and the black-nail-polish brat. And then came the disease, the lost son, the dying/hospital scenes, the unavoidable death, the inevitable crush between Leelee and the son there were gallons of tears dripping all over the furniture while soppy Hollywood violins doodled in the background... You get the picture.When I found out that the actress Christine Lahti directed this junk I wasn't really surprised 1) what I really wanna do is direct is a disease that nearly every thespian catches nowadays, and 2) Lahti is one of those actresses that you've seen weep a 1000 times in about as many movies...
