As anyone who has read the John Fowles novel will appreciate, this is one text for which adaptation would not be a walk in the park. How unfounded my uncertainty was! The director, writer and actors did a fantastic job in adapting a complex novel to the screen. The film works impeccably as a metaphor for what the novel was trying to achieve, which is all we should expect from film adaptations. Stand out features include The actors are perfect. I can't say anything new about Meryl Streep, who I believe to be the finest actress ever to have graced the cinema screen. Here (as ever) she is perfect - if you didn't know she was American you would believe she is English, the accent is so accurate. She embodies the character of Sarah perfectly with a multi layered performance, managing to convey Sarah's dignity, her independence and her complex mystery. My only criticism (if you can call it that) is that she is too beautiful! According to the novel, Sarah is not beautiful by any period's standards, but with her porcelain complexion and delicate features, Meryl Streep is stunning. As Charles, Jeremy Irons gives a commanding performance, managing to convey the character's genteel veneer and the inner passion that lurks beneath. Both actors are excellent, and the chemistry between the leads is tangible. A Story within a story. The way in which Harold Pinter weaves the Fowles tale with the lives of Anna and Mike - the actresses who are playing the Victorian lovers, is inspired. The manner in which the film flits from Victorian age to modern day, is the filmic way of conveying Fowles's tendency in the novel to judge his Victorian characters and their era by Twentieth Century standards. Some critics have found this device jarring - I find it clever and affecting. Overall, 'The French Lieutenant's Woman' is a beautiful, haunting tale of repressed love and social hypocrisy. Right from the opening shot, where we see the image of Sarah on the Cobb looking out to sea, the viewer is grabbed and drawn into this complex world. The actors are faultless, the screenplay ingenious and the cinematography and score, haunting. If you normally find yourself disappointed by novel adaptations, look no further than 'The French Lieutenant's Woman' to show you that when a work is adapted properly, the results can be stunning.

The image is apropos, as the story itself opens from chamber to ever larger chamber as it weaves two seemingly disparate stories with a clever ending.Jeremy Irons and Meryl Streep are impressive as the leads in two different time lines. In one, Streep is a woman of poor reputation who ensnares a gentleman (Irons) in the black hole of her own guilt and loss. In the other, they are the romantically involved actors making a movie about a woman of poor reputation who ensnares a gentleman. And if that sounds a little too clever, it nonetheless has more creativity and insight than typical plot-twist movie, including the most contrived and overrated movie of all time, Memento (not good enough to be called bad).There is a scene, in which Streep and Irons are rehearsing a scene from the movie, and, according to the story, it just isn't working. Then, all at once, Streep gets a look on her face, and we are transported into the past time line with a single glance from the greatest working actress and second only to Katherine Hepburn as the greatest actress of all time.The cinematography, costumes and set designs are legendary, and come from the same team that gave us The Count of Monte Christo, which featured Guy Pearce, who was in the above-mentioned Memento (it still stinks, but how's that for six degrees?). And speaking of legends, the screenplay was written by none other than Nobel laureate Harold Pinter, and it shows.It is a sublime movie experience to watch the delicately chambered story open up, and there are scenes that are so memorable, like Streep on the misty pier, that you would swear this movie comes from the Golden Age of cinema, not the go-go eighties. The movie is emotionally draining, and Streep gives a typically high concept performance. Irons lacks something, but it's not clear what, but in the end it helps support the story by making him appear flawed enough to have been trapped in the intricate web of The French Lieutenant's Woman.

Fowles' work was pale compared to Nabokov's Pale Fire, for instance in building a convoluted, layered narrative, but is comparable in extent. Here, Pinter's obsession with time refines the vision -- his Proust Screenplay, also centered on layered time, is much studied and admired.Everything clicks here. Gorton's designs are detailed and hypnotizing, especially the use of the Lyme groin and related tunnel-like streets. Francis' camera (after Elephant Man) captures a dim grey sky, made sharp in modern sequences. With the director, they have contrived to quote great paintings. In particular, the first shot after the three year search when Irons gets the telegram directly and obviously references a famous Monet painting -- in fact the first impressionistic painting, a turning point in the artist's perspective. Davis' music -- the only thing that spans time -- supports. And Meryl is lovely, but so different in each role. We really wonder if her modern madness created the modern affair in quest of the perfect chemistry for the Sarah role It makes Sarah's imagination deeper and more self-referential than in the book. One scene is uniquely masterful the modern actors walk through a scene, then they do it again. Streep turns on, steps into the role and becomes Sarah, and a moment later, she pulls the whole scene into the past. This will stick with you, I promise.The director, Reisz, is supposed to have suggested the concept to Pinter, and then attracted the very best. His tightness of vision is apparent. I wish he were still making films. In a sense he is he literally wrote the book on modern film editing.

The film-within-the-film is more than just an experimental device - it is actually a key feature of how the film works and part of what makes it so fascinating and enjoyable. Harold Pinter, who wrote the screenplay and has a Nobel Prize for Literature, should be given some credit for knowing what he is doing. The two stories in the film are juxtaposed to provide intriguing contrasts and comparisons. At first, I found myself thinking that the point was to show how much easier and more uncomplicated sexual relationships are in the twentieth century, but as the story develops, and as more entanglements obstructing their happiness are revealed, I began to realize that the film may really be trying to show that we are not so different from the Victorians after all we have our own obsessions, repressions and frustrations. A happy middle-class family proves to be as much of an obstacle to sexual gratification and fulfilment as hypocritical Victorian morality. A warning there is no point watching this film for visible and clearly expressed emotion and a satisfyingly romantic representation of love in this film, since it makes a point of resisting that by focusing on the characters' awkward and embarrassing fumblings, and by deliberately avoiding all the clich√©s of period drama. The inclusion of the contemporary story line actually helps us to distance ourselves from the Victorian plot rather than drawing us into it, and makes Jeremy Irons's proposal at the beginning, or the love scene in Exeter between him and Streep, more comic and ridiculous, than volcanic and romantic. But that is the point, isn't it? Period films have a tendency to ignore how bizarre sexuality was in the past, and by romanticizing and familiarizing it, make it more easy for us to consume now. But there was no such thing as normal sexuality in Victorian Britain, because, as the statistic about London prostitutes in the film shows, they were all far too screwed up. And maybe we are not so different these days. It's not as if the sex industry has got any smaller since then. It's not a conventional period romance, but if you want something a little more thoughtful and interesting than that, then you will hugely enjoy this film. Apart from anything else, it has two great performances from Jeremy Irons and Meryl Streep. Streep in particular is spectacularly mysterious and alluring as the object of Irons's sexual obsession. Great film.

Known to the locals as poor tragedy, she sketches spooky self-portraits, always dresses in black and haunts the sea wall waiting for the return of a Frenchman who seduced and abandoned her. With a single, unforgettable look and such dialogue as my only happiness is when I sleep; when I wake, the nightmare begins, Sarah bewitches visiting Londoner Charles Smithson (Jeremy Irons, in what turned out to be his big break), a paleontologist and gentleman of leisure. The tricky screenplay by Harold Pinter contrasts the story of Sarah and Charles with the lives of actors Mike and Anna, who are playing them in a film. Offscreen, Anna is anything but Victorian, indulging in an on-location affair with Mike while her husband is away. The contrasts between the two couples born 100 years apart make for one of the most intriguing films of the early 1980s, and the performances by Irons and Streep are predictably outstanding.

The settings are superbly created -- the green, grotto-like woodland where Irons and Streep meet in the Victorian world of the film, the murky streets of Lyme, Exeter, and London, and the interior of the lawyer's office, for example. The Victorian part of the film emerges from the dawning of the concept of abnormal psychology (just before Freud) and is really convincing. Streep shows us that her character cannot move on emotionally until she has worked out her own madness. That constitutes a remarkable and complex performance of insanity and self-awareness inhabiting a single psyche. She earns the gentle movement out of the tunnel and onto the calm lake. The turbulence of the unconscious -- that threatening sea of which Irons has warned her -- has been subdued. Seems to me the flaw lies in the 'modern story' (as some here have pointed out). It may be that the Streep character is trying to find a subtext for her fictional heroine, but it looks like the old ennui, so that, while her lack of concern for the relationship is understandable, his obsession with it is not. Though the garden party at the end almost gets it there. Were we shown her decision there? If so, I missed it. I like the concept of the 'two endings' and their contrast, but the ending in the 20th century was a so what? The one in the 19th century was complex and included much of the pain that the relationship had caused both characters. A little more attention to the contemporary love affair -- to suggest that it was more than just a romp on location -- would have helped that dimension of the film per se and also suggested what the Victorian lovers had earned within their Hardyesque world. "},{"Title":"Powerful Victorian romance; the modern scenes would have been better omitted.","Date":"18 July 2007","Score":"8 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Although John Fowles's novel is set in the Victorian period and deals with a love affair, it is more than just a period romance. Throughout the book there is a strong authorial voice, which Fowles uses to comment on Victorian social and sexual mores, and the way in which they contrast with those of Fowles's own day. The book famously has two alternative endings, one happy and the other tragic; this device is perhaps Fowles's ironic comment on literary conventions and on the omniscient narrator persona which he adopts elsewhere in the work.These stylistic devices therefore mean that this is not the easiest of novels to transfer to the screen. The solution that Harold Pinter came up with was to combine Fowles's Victorian story with another story, set in the present day. The film moves back and forth between the two periods. A similar device was used in another British film of this period, Heat and Dust, although in that case both stories were present in the film's literary source.The Victorian part of the film tells the story of Charles Smithson, a wealthy gentleman and amateur scientist, who visits Lyme Regis in Dorset in order to search for fossils. (The area around Lyme has become known as The Jurassic Coast because of the rich fossil beds in the area). While there he meets and falls in love with a young woman named Sarah Woodruffe, even though he is already engaged to Ernestina, the pretty daughter of a wealthy businessman.Some years ago, Sarah was jilted by her sweetheart, a French lieutenant, and has been named by the locals Poor Tragedy from her habit of walking along the seashore, dressed in black, looking out to sea as though waiting for his return. The belief that she was the man's mistress has gained her the more contemptuous title of The French Lieutenant's Whore; the film's title derives from the reluctance of the genteel Ernestina to use the word whore. Charles's initial feeling is simply one of concern for the young woman's welfare, but he soon feels a powerful attraction for her and decides that he must leave Ernestina for her, despite being warned by his friend Dr Grogan not to do so. Grogan has diagnosed Sarah as suffering from what he calls obscure melancholy, a condition which manifests itself in intense guilt feelings and in the masochistic tendency to inflict emotional pain on herself.The modern-day part of the film concerns the attempt to make a film about the story of Charles and Sarah, and the affair between Mike and Anna, the actors cast in the two leading roles. Jeremy Irons plays both Charles and Mike, and Meryl Streep both Sarah and Anna.The Victorian part of the film works very well as a powerful and potentially tragic love-story, conjuring up the sexual repression and double standards which dominated that period. Sarah and her French sweetheart were not, in fact, lovers in the physical sense, but many local people believed they were, and this suspicion has been enough to blight her life. It is unlikely that a man's reputation would have been destroyed by a casual encounter in this way. On the other hand, double standards could also sometimes work against the male sex as well. A woman, for example, who decided she had made a mistake by getting engaged would have found it much easier to break her engagement. Charles only avoids being sued for breach of promise by signing a humiliating confession, in which he acknowledges that he has forfeited the right to be considered a gentleman, and is haunted by guilt over broken engagement, especially as Ernestina has done nothing to deserve such treatment. In the book Ernestina comes across as rather insipid, but here Lynsey Baxter, only sixteen at the time and appearing in her first film, makes her a delightful young lady.Irons and Streep are excellent as Charles and Sarah. (This was also Irons's first leading film role, and the one which made him a major star). Streep copes perfectly with the British accent, although she did perhaps sound a bit too upper-class for Sarah, who comes from a lower-middle-class background. She also looks particularly striking in this film, with her red hair and pale alabaster complexion contrasting with her black clothing. The scene where Charles first meets her, on the storm-swept Cobb in Lyme, has become one of the most iconic scenes in the cinema of the eighties. There are also excellent performances from Leo McKern as the perceptive and kindly Grogan, from Peter Vaughan as Ernestina's doting father and from Patience Collier as Sarah's obnoxious employer Mrs Poulteney.I am a great admirer of the original novel, but what works on the printed page cannot always be transferred to the screen, and Pinter's attempt to find a cinematic equivalent to Fowles's literary devices struck me as a vain one. The modern-day love story always seemed weak and trivial by comparison with the much more serious Victorian one. Neither Mike nor Anna was a sympathetic character, especially as both were married and cheating on their spouses. When Anna decides not to leave her husband for Mike we do not feel pity for him in the way that we pity Charles when he is abandoned by Sarah. I felt that the film-makers would have done better to omit the modern scenes and to concentrate exclusively on the Victorian story. The result would have been a different film, but in my view probably a better one. Nevertheless, the film we have is a fine one. 8/10 "},{"Title":"More than just a great film. It's an experience of seeing how reality and fiction works","Date":"16 July 2011","Score":"6 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Beautiful, original and intelligent of using a certain source (a book written by John Fowles), changing the perspective presented in it and turning it into a fresh cinematic experience that is as much satisfying than the original source, the film version of The French Lieutenant's Woman escapes the sometimes overused routine of following the literature step by step by creating a nice way to compare life with reality, mixing two stories into basically the same context. Harold Pinter's screenplay takes the story from the book, told in the Victorian England, and adds the element of the movie within a movie, dividing it into two segments the actors playing in a romantic film and the actors life in a current period. Let me organize the situation in the modern times, two actors (played by Jeremy Irons and Meryl Streep, are shooting a movie whose story takes place in 1800's, with Irons playing an respected biologist engaged to a rich woman who ends up falling in love by the mysterious French Liutenant's woman (Streep), who awaits for his lover to return. During those times where moral was above anything else their romance seems to be faded to failure, almost impossible to exist since she isn't seen with good looks by society constantly called as crazy or as the French Lieutenant's whore. This is practically an unhappy story at first glance. Later, we'll notice the actors life following the same path as the characters they play except the times are other, things are a lot easier for them; they're in love with each other but they're married with other people. And this story seems a happier story than the other, also at first glance. The intersection of both stories serves to show us not only which couple (the real one or the fictional one) might last together but also the period contrasts (there's a scene in which the actors are reading a paper with informations of how things were during the Victorian Era and they are surprised by the facts they learn) The examination one must have of both stories is the relationship between the characters played by Streep and Irons, and the way both have similarities even one being a work of fiction and the other being the reality. The only problem with the film directed by Karel Reisz is the fact we spend more time following the movie within the movie instead of following more of the actors life and their romance, which only had a notable importance when the other story was concluding as well. I'm not saying that the other story wasn't interesting but we should spend an equally balanced time with both segments so that we could see things more fairly, properly presented. Even so, the screenplay is brilliantly written and very original in terms of developing a story that goes to show the distinction between fiction and reality without playing tricks or use of excessive surprises to impress the viewers. But a film is not only its script. The French Lieutenant's Woman has an fascinating and careful art direction and sceneries, beautifully made, recreating England of the 19th Century is great details; costumes and clothes are also great; the cinematography is impeccable and one of the most wonderful works I've ever seen. At last, the most interesting aspect of the film is the acting delivered by Meryl Streep (Oscar nominated for this roles, after all she plays two roles) and Jeremy Irons (he deserved a nomination that year, playing one of his first leading roles showing a great talent in carrying the whole film). I've seen them playing another couple in the underrated The House of the Spirits and I loved them in that film just as much as in this film. They make acting seem easy whether playing complicated characters like the ones played here or in blockbuster films as well. And their characters go through everything here, love, hate, insanity, possession, kindness, a high range of emotions that very few actors can be natural and have a certain simplicity in playing it. Sparks fly high when they're together! Where do we have the chance to be really happy? In fiction or in reality? True love is that same kind of love we see in pictures or it's different in life? See it for yourself and think of some conclusions by watching this absolutely great film. 10/10 "},{"Title":"Top quality performances","Date":"31 October 2004","Score":"9 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Fantastic performance from Jeremy Irons, and of course Meryl Streep is flawless. 1981's interpretation of a period piece, contrasted with '81 present day.

The primary focus is on the plot developments of a film within the film--a story of two illicit lovers in 19th century England--while a secondary narrative follows the two leads in that film who pursue a similar relationship to the one they portray. The way these two stories intercut back and forth is, unfortunately, one of the few interesting things in the movie. Unique to this presentation is the way the Victorian Era scenes are shown only (with the opening scene being a lone exception) as a finished product, that is, we see that part of the film as its theoretical audience would. There are no shots of cameras in the foreground, no scenes of director and crew watching rushes in a darkened theater. This device might have allowed the viewer to become more involved in the old-time goings on--if only we had been given something, anything onto which we could have hung our emotional hats. This is the insurmountable problem of The French Lieutenant's Woman. While the Victorian Era plot is luxuriantly mounted--while the characters are played by wonderful actors--the heart of this film is occupied by this film within a film device. While interesting, it's not enough to keep our interest from flagging. In both story lines, emotions are uniformly muted, or absent altogether. The 20th century story is about two bored actors who engage in their affair simply as a distraction from the tedium of making a movie. No hint of passion here. The Victorian narrative at least provides a HINT of feeling, but always held at arms length--and further attenuated by the inevitable return to the modern story, reminding us that the costumer portion of the film is not only not real, but TWICE removed from reality. There is a scene at the end of the movie where all signs point to some grand cathartic denouement--a scene where, finally, we will be swept up into the currents of these players' lives, the promise of romance finally realized. Instead we are given an awkward, bumbled scene without so much as a kiss or an eloquent avowal of love. We are left with a muted, distant view of the two purported lovers on a lake--its surface as calm and unmoved as the film's audience. A disappointing end to a disappointing film.

I am stunned that none of the reviewers even mentioned it and I am coming to the conclusion that the human race is developing damaged audio organs. The average film these days, even those from the biggest studios and with the biggest budgets, suffer from utterly unrealistic voice registration.

In either case the result is usually terrible, with the acoustics making no sense at all with the picture being shown. As a result the atmosphere, for those with ears not destroyed by ipods or walkmen, is destroyed and the film has no presence or reality.

While the Victorian society is suffocating in its prim and proper moralizing, relationships are not necessarily easier in the liberal modern era either, as it is always difficult to follow one's heart without hurting someone in the process.Technically the film is well made, the historic sets and costumes look good and Streep and Irons are convincing in their double roles. Especially the eponymous Sarah character is full of tragic mystery and understandably carries the film whenever she is on. The pace is slow and peaceful, allowing the romances to develop without haste. In the end the Victorian story gets more attention and is probably what the film is best remembered for, but the present day romance is a tale worth telling too.

I'm glad I did. If you have romance in your soul, this is apt to get you, inside. I only left this out of my 250 list because due to being something of a 'grinch', I tend to side with LIFE'S version of how things end, rather than literatures; but oh well... !

However, though I realize I am in the minority and the movie's praises were universally sung, I personally did not care for it, finding it somewhat boring, occasionally confusing, and worst of all, NOT emotionally engaging.The film relates the story of two romances...the affair between two actors, Anna (Meryl Streep) and Mike (Jeremy Irons), who are playing the roles of lovers Sarah Woodruff and Charles Smithson, in a movie set back in 19th Century Britain. Frankly, the darting back and forth between the two affairs, creative though it may have been, was for me simply distracting. I found that I couldn't really become emotionally involved with either couple, and was sometimes even confused as to the point being made.The stars are accomplished actors and their performances were lauded at the time. Personally, Meryl Streep is normally not my favorite actress as I feel she tends to overact, though I really liked her in Music of the Heart. Jeremy Irons is certainly competent and was quite brilliant in The Mission.The modern relationship between Anna and Mike simply bored me. During her husband's absence, Anna is indulging in an affair while on location with her co-star. I found this pair unsympathetic and their affair uninteresting. Even THEY did not seem that interested in it! I would have preferred NO story within a story, but simply ONE romance, the Victorian couple, Sarah and Charles. In that case, I might have found their tale more compelling.As to the Victorian Era affair...Charles is a paleontologist, engaged to be married to a proper young lady, Ernestine, of good family and dowry, when he is bewitched by the fascinating, outcast Sarah and begins a passionate affair. The film does dramatically reveal the contrast between the outwardly respectable, genteel Charles (a proper Victorian gentleman), and his hitherto sexually repressed but actually passionate inner self, as revealed by this illicit love. Sarah, a wronged and tainted woman of ill repute, dubbed by some as 'the French lieutenant's whore', is mysterious and melancholy. My enduring mental picture from this film is of Sarah looking forlornly out to sea, waiting for the return of the French soldier who seduced and abandoned her.The film has beautiful cinematography, especially the 19th Century scenery. I generally love romances from this period, and I note that another reviewer compared the dramatic seascapes here to the moor landscapes of Wuthering Heights. Yes, sort of a similar mood with the enigmatic, outcast Sarah even shades of the brooding Heathcliff. However, while Wuthering Heights is a film of haunting emotions, this liaison between the respectable Charles and the outcast Sarah had little impact on me. Apparently, the point of the movie (so I have read) seems to be not so much engaging the viewer emotionally as comparing love affairs from the two eras...the forbidden Victorian passions in sharp contrast to the not very passionate, sort of half bored, casual affair of the modern actors. Yes, the contrast is apparent here, so in this goal, it succeeded. Nevertheless, I would have greatly preferred emotional engagement. I didn't read the novel of the same name, but understand the film within a film approach was meant to replace the narrator's role in the book. If so, this technique may have been clever and artistic, but left me personally cold and simply detached from it all.

It's a pointless approach, as the contemporary scenes don't add anything to the film but length. It also doesn't help that Irons and Streep, though both immensely talented actors, aren't exactly the go-to people for breast- heaving, corset-rending passion. One who had never read Fowles' novel would come nowhere near having a sense of how great it is based on this adaptation alone.It's a handsome looking film, I'll give it that, and I'm not the only one who thinks so, as it garnered Academy Award nominations for Art Direction and Costume Design back in 1981. Its juggling of two parallel stories impressed the Academy into giving it an editing nomination as well. The last two of its five nominations went to Pinter for his screenplay and Streep, in one of her few undeserved nominations, for Best Actress.Grade B "},{"Title":"Sex, Then and Now","Date":"17 July 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" This is one of those movies where you suspect that someone is trying to make a profound point, but you feel like a dummy because you just cannot figure out what it is. The best I could come up with is that love is just as nerve-wracking today as it was in the nineteenth century, only today men don't have to worry about being sued for breach of promise, and women don't have to worry about being ruined for life. So I guess we can call that progress. There is a ludicrous scene in which Irons finally gets to have sex with Streep (in the nineteenth century), and he spends more time taking off his clothes than he does having sex with her. So that is another difference in the nineteenth century, people wore more clothes and had less foreplay.

The framing device of the movie being made is OK. It annoyed me back in the day, but I can see its effectiveness now. It is a way to make commentary on the Victorian times (and their hypocrisy), plus I suppose that it substitutes for that additional cycle of hurt. Great settings and photography of 1860's England.

I had remembered only two things from it The quality of Meryl Streep's acting and the famous scene of her standing on the very edge of a stone wave breaker while the sea burst around her. I had forgotten that it was a film within a film. I had forgotten all but the vaguest outlines of the plot. I had entirely forgotten Jeremy Irons. If retention in memory is the hallmark of a good work of art, I'd have to give The French Lieutenant's Woman a low mark.And yet the second viewing of the film was a revelation. I hadn't previously been struck by how beautiful Meryl Streep was when she was young. Nor did I remember how controlled her acting was in this overwrought movie. The French Lieutenant's Woman was nominated for five Academy Awards and deservedly lost all five, including Ms. Streep's nomination as best actress. Nevertheless, this was one of the record number of nominations she has compiled and it should be seen if only for that reason. It adds a different dimension to her incomparable portfolio of challenging roles. Jeremy Irons fares less well in my estimation. Like Ms. Streep, he plays two parts, one as her co-star in the film being made and the other as the lover ruined by his all-consuming love for her film character. Not that Irons does a bad job of acting. He simply fails to be convincing in the second of his two roles. That may be because the story (or the part) is inherently unconvincing, sort of Wuthering Heights without the emotional tide which causes that heavy- breathing romance to seem plausible to many women if not to their menfolk.It's still not a great movie. Maybe not even a good movie. But if all we ever cared to watch were good/great films, Hollywood would soon be out of business.

She portrays two roles- Anna and Sarah, one an actress of the modern period of 1981 and the other a fallen woman of Victorian England. The novel by John Fowles is far more complex and this Hollywood treatment, adapted for the big screen by Harold Pinter, is a lengthy, bittersweet romance without the multiple layers of meaning that the novel had. But all this can be overlooked when you consider the fine performances by the principal actors and the prestige quality of this costume film, not to mention the innovative juxtaposition of a modern extramarital romance and an one happening in 1880's England. Jeremy Irons portrays Mike, an actor who is Anna's co-star in a costume drama about a forbidden romance between two married people. Irons also plays Charles Henry Smithson, the married Victorian who breaks his wedding vows and engages in a relationship with the unsavory Sarah Woodruff, a married woman who boldly defies conventions. This film boasts wonderful cinematography by Freddie Francis, whose look is dreamy and yet realistic all at once while maintaining an unusually literary quality, much like another great Meryl Streep film from this same 80's decade- Out Of Africa. The rarest part of this movie is the constant jumping back and forth between time periods as we see the relationships progress. Meryl Streep glows with a beauty and charm all her own and has the superb training of an actress reared in the fine tradition of actresses like Katherine Hepburn. She totally encompasses the spirit of both women, who are really one. She is modern, liberated and yet stricken with guilt and anxiety, which ultimately results in her decision to break up with Charles. Jeremy Irons is doing his usual great thing here and there is excellent chemistry between Irons and Streep. The part of the film that got to me was the ending (spoiler alert). The modern times relationship between Anna and Mike ends unhappily but the Victorian Era romance between Sarah and Charles ends happily, as if to say only in film or fantasy romances of the past do we find true happiness but reality is far more complex and tragic. With original music by Carl Davis, who attempts to emulate late Romantic/classical music and lovely costumes by Tom Rand. This is a remarkable movie. Fans of Meryl Streep will eat it up. This is a great role in a film early in her career and she would only continue making one great film after another.

I put it off for a few days fearing the film would be boring and unengaging but I was pleasantly surprised! I was in a state of confusion for the first few minutes of the movie, what on earth was going on?! Had they put the trailer at the start of the video, had I bought a behind the scenes tape by mistake? I was so shocked I had to stop the film and read some comments on here to clarify what was going on! When I found out there were two stories set in different eras going on simultaneously, I was eager to find out more and whether this device would work.I thought the use of the two stories, one the plot between Sarah and Charles set in the 19th century and the other, the actors playing them, Anna and Mike was an interesting and original idea although one which I am not sure was entirely necessary. The use of modern appliances to emphasize when the film was in the 1980s also seemed a little brash.However, the film really made me care for the characters and I was caught up in the emotion of it all.

I also didn't like the idea of adding Anna's and Mike's world in the story. I'd rather prefer just to be in Sarah's and Charles' reality. It's true that John Fowles often interrupt the narration to comment something or to compare the two centuries. However, Anna's and Mike's existence didn't touch his comments at all. In the first half of the film their scenes last too little so they are not useful. In the second half their story becomes more interesting but at the end it seemed to me that it was a small and fast-made movie, violently put into J.F's story.

But, I was not seeing Meryl and Iron on the screen, even they were playing two characters so common to their reality, they find their own character's personality -a personality different than theirs.

She is the French lieutenant's woman and is shunned by the village for having had an affair with the married man. She now moons over her absent lover and waits for the return that will never be realized.Irons is an independently wealthy naturalist who visits the village in search of fossils and finds love for the darkly mysterious Streep, although Irons himself has just married into a family of some repute. He divorces his wife -- shocking! -- and gives up his status as an honorable gentleman. He gives Streep money, and later follows her to London, loses her, finds her three years later, and she rejects him because she has now become a liberated woman.There is a parallel story that doesn't get much time. It takes place today. Irons and Streep, both married, are having a fling during the shooting of a film. Again, Irons falls in love, but for Streep the encounter was far more casual and despite his efforts, she takes off happily with her French husband.The only Fowles novel I've read is The Magus, which follows a similar trajectory -- man is coerced into a woman's thrall and is then deliberately and openly betrayed by her. The traditional Madia Gond, a tribe in India, had a custom called the ghotul in which adolescent boys and girls lived in the same house and played musical beds each night, whether they wanted to or not. The elders of the tribe claimed that this practice was intended to cure them of love. I begin to wonder if Fowles isn't on the same trip. You know, Most friendship is feigning; most loving mere folly? Jeremy Irons as the uptight Victorian naturalist manqu√© never steps wrong. He ALWAYS never steps wrong. Meryl Streep. If you've seen her in later character roles like The Iron Lady, you may not remember how lovely, pale, and fragile she could be in her earlier films. She's a splendid actress, even though make up has given her a mop of dark reddish hair so massive that it may have its own time zones. And both of the actors are perfectly capable of overcoming the sometimes stilted dialog I have taken unpardonable advantage of your condition. Forgive me. There are some allusions to Darwin but I don't think they amount to very much.It was directed by Karel Reisz. He directed the colossal art house flop called Weeds, which was saved from complete obscurity only by my own stellar performance as an extra. Boy, did I establish atmosphere, or what? A prisoner smoking with a cigarette holder, a masterful touch! Here, whatever else we may say about the film, Reisz and his photographer, Freddie Francis, have paid such close attention to composition, values, rich colors, and camera placement that every shot is almost a painting in itself.I'm compelled to recommend it, although I wish the endings had been different and at least ONE of the Ironses finally wound up with one of the Streeps, but no dice. It's a story of lost loves, along the lines of Wuthering Heights, but I wasn't bored for a moment.

Essentially, the movie centres around an actor and an actress who are rehearsing a Victorian script and who are themselves engaged in something of an affair.  But the movie's prime focus is a similar relationship actually in Victorian times between a scientist and disturbed woman who the locals named Tragedy.  The movie is cleverly written and thoroughly engaging, although sometimes the movie does tend to drag on a little.  The scientist in question is a Mr. Charles Smithson who is on the verge of marrying his sweetheart, a young woman who is the daughter of a well off shipping merchant.  All goes well until one fateful meeting between the woman who people call the French Lieutenant's whore, and the aforementioned Smithson.  The movie manages to bring together multiple aspects of emotion wand shows an adeptness at handling its material.  The characters involved are varied and diverse also, from the typical old age Victorian female taskmaster to the cheeky cherubic servants of Smithson and Miss Ernestina.  The blend of characters ensures that the movie is rarely dull, and I was really impressed by Meryl Streep's performance.  Playing the woman who has been tarnished by her past, the movie takes an unexpected turn and she manages to bring to life an energetic and mildly touching performance that spurs on the last three quarters of an hour.  Jeremy Irons was steady throughout and he seems particularly suited to that lovable upstanding citizen type with just a little bit of unpredictability about him.  The scenery was beautiful and the landscapes were used to show the general mood of the characters throughout.  Smithson who was soon besotted with this enigmatic woman soon realises however that a sense of reality must dictate, but who eventually succumbs to his raw emotions.  Meanwhile, the issue of true love keeps burning right to the very end.  The movie also manages to create an anger at our characters as many people get hurt because of the central characters actions, in both contexts.  A good movie then, which lacked any real cutting edge to be considered great, but nevertheless an impressive effort.

The movement between the two plotlines really kind of scared me at first, like my dad had switched the video's or something.  But then slowly, the contrasts between the two plots and the visual movement started to mix nicely.  Like Maltin said, jarring, at first.  But I think that the ending was a little weird, but chalked up to the time the film was made.  Hey, we can't all have movies get up to speed just by watching them now.thanks "},{"Title":"Muted romanticism","Date":"14 October 2005","Score":"4 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" John Fowles adapts Harold Pinter, two literate gentleman not exactly known for harlequin-styled romance. So much for the romantic angle of this rather heavy plot concerning a woman-of-ill-repute having an affair with a French soldier in 1860's England; at a counterpoint is the contemporary actress and actor playing these roles in a movie--and sharing a similar relationship off-screen. Mixture of fantasy and reality doesn't really come off, as the pacing is sluggish on both counts. Meryl Streep and Jeremy Irons are arch and uninvolving, although the production design is admittedly beautiful and Freddie Francis' cinematography is sumptuous. Ambitious perhaps, but unmoving. *1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"Streep's 1st Starring Role!","Date":"27 April 2004","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  The French Lieutenant's Woman (1981) Finally a full-fledged starring role!

The structure of the story is indeed interesting there are two threads, one for current actor and actress; the other for the characters they are playing.  Yet Meryl Streep's acting is extraordinary.  See this part when Anna(played by Meryl) is thrown down by Mike(by Jeremy), she got up with trembling limbs, showing the tension in her heart. I feel this type of role suits Meryl Streep, it's very much like Sophie in Sophie's choice.

If it was done today, there would undoubtedly be a post-modern twist, in which a significant part of the viewing experience would be the judgment we would be invited to make on the nature of the inner production.  However, in this film, the outer story is quite limited (and Jeremy Irons appears to be playing the same role in both tales), while the inner film is a straight costume drama as they were made twenty years ago, stodgy and unsubtle in both direction and plot.  The latter - sexually repressed man meets innately mysterious woman - is drearily predictable - he's even an evolutionist, a depressingly common and obvious career choice for characters of this sort; while Meryl Streep's persona seems to owe more to pre-Raphaelite romanticism than the real world.  Meanwhile, all the moderns do is provide some distraction from the thinness of the characterisation and story in the film that they make. Fundamentally, this film works according to our prejudices about the Victorian world (and how it differs from ours) rather than challenging them - and spins two weak stories where one strong one would be better.  It's not awful, but a bit disappointing considering the potential in the concept of parallel lives; a remake would be interesting, if made by a director with a less precious view of 19th century life.

Of course now that I think about it, I knew several long haired, earnest, moustachioed young men back then, Jeremy reminded me of all of them throughout the movie, making it hard to pay attention to the film. Not that the film was all that interesting. Meryl Streep is oh so lovely and forlorn in her roll as Sarah and just plain good looking in her roll as Ann the 20th century movie star. Streep and Irons did well with the material, but there wasn't much given them really and Irons does look a bit silly plodding around the countryside in his fashionable Victorian suits. Still the possibilities of their love kept me hoping.The single most annoying factor was Lynsey Baxter as Ernestina, the fiancee of Jeremy Irons' Charles Smithson. She looked and acted like she had just walked over from the filming of a Jane Austen novel, totally out of place, in this dark piece. That said most of the other characters seemed disjointed or knew more of what was going on than we are shown. The doctor, for instance, seems to know more of the depth of Smithson's feelings than even Smithson. That would be OK if we were given some clues as well, but we are not.In the end I just kept watching for the nostalgia of the look the Jeremy Irons wears so well and that isn't such a bad thing, is it?

Gaping? That too. His basic take on the film under discussion, the Karel Reisz visualization of the John Fowles novel is fine by me. Indeed, I agree with much if not most of it. But comparing the vast and incomparable acting skills of Meryl Streep with the limited, if highly personable, projections of Katharine Hepburn, in whatever reference, is like raising Boston baked beans above every Michelin star ever recorded for chefs' toques. Dorothy Parker had it right when she characterized Hepburn's Broadway debut as running the dramatic gamut from A to B. And la Hepburn, for all her broad-A girl/boy blandishments and Hollywood hoots, African Queen included, ditto the dismal Golden Pond, may well be one preeminent projection of cinematic gumption and gall, so far as esthetics and art can be concerned, but she was NO actress. Performer, maybe. Persona, for sure. But name me ONE performance in which she was anything other than Katharine Hepburn. As for the film arguably under discussion. for me, it was magical, and Streep's performance(s) was/were absolutely galvanizing.

I was quickly reminded of how boring and drawn out it is, and even though it's beautiful I needed something w/ more of a pace. If you are a Meryl Streep fan, she gives a knockout performance and the movie is worth watching for her alone. However this movie flows like The Bridges of Madison County, another amazing performance in a film that I will never rewatch b/c it is so slow, but she embodies those characters well. The cinematography, lighting, shots, locations are outstanding, yet make the story move slowly and beautifully, yet the story is hard to follow and makes u so bored that it is hard to separate story lines. All in all, a beautiful film if you do not have digital cable, youtube, myspace, facebook, or an iphone, b/c those will make u distracted and lose focus. This movie would not be enjoyable to anyone ADD, ADHD, w/ a short attention span, who did not go to an Ivey League school, or someone who takes a lot of breaks. If you are in a hospital bed or retired you might enjoy this slow-moving long journey.

In The French Lieutenant's Woman, she sports an English accent.That said, there isn't really much to the movie. Essentially a cross between a Jane Austen novel and a tell-all Hollywood story, this movie tells of an actress (Streep) whose role in a movie reflects her real life. Jeremy Irons plays her husband in both the movie and in the movie-within-a-movie.The movie doesn't suck. I guess that it's the same sort of situation with movies like Hurry Sundown given the talent involved, they should have come up with something better.

I have since learned to read between the lines with a bunch of national critics, knowing their cultural bias. This story is full of postmodern bias and is one of those film-within-a film stories. A lot of times, those are clever but if they aren't done right, they are big bombs and movie-goers are turned off. That's what happened here, and one reason you see so few reviews on a film that national critics - naturally - loved. It didn't do well at the box office, either.If you watch a lot of movies, you will see and hear things in TFLW that are familiar, such as Meryl Streep with another foreign accent, plugs for evolution and cheap shots against Christians, digs against the Victorian Era and huzzahs for anything liberated, etc. You get the picture. The agenda is the normal left-of-center.A person portrayed as downright nasty in this movie is one who believes in God, reads the Bible and is always shown with a cross around her neck. The leading man, however, the good guy, is a disciple of Charles Darwin, the man who brought us the enlightening theory of evolution. This is just one example of what I am talking about in the above paragraph.The story involves a bunch of real life elitist actors playing themselves - talking, rehearsing their lines, sleeping together, etc. - in the Victorian Age and making it all look grand. Speaking of that, the film does offer some beautiful photography.As for Streep, a wonderful actress, this was her debut and she went on to star in films with Danish accents, Australian, Polish and a host of others. I've always liked Jeremy Irons, too, who is the male star in here. I have no problems with the acting, cinematography and the story - it's the other prejudices that I am tired of seeing on film that makes one viewing of this movie enough.
