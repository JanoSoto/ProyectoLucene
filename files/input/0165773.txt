So disturbed were some of the viewers that they refused to applaud the movie - That was to freaky, said a local movie buff, I didn't need to see that. The movie begins by fooling the audience. It starts as a bittersweet tale of a young Irish girl (Elaine Cassidy) who sleeps with a British Army soldier and is shunned by her family. She is exiled to Birmingham, England, where she meets Joe, a kindly old man (Bob Hoskins). So far, a pretty typical poignant Irish drama. Suddenly, some rapid editing and jolting images reveal that Joe ain't so sweet. In fact he's one of the most vicious, despicable psychopaths you'll ever seen on screen. The mood is extremely fearful for the remainder as Elaine Cassidy's perfect rendition of an innocent Irish Catholic girl screams out for help. Hoskins has played the best role of his life of a tortured, gentle, caring, sick, evil but very human man. His performance is only comparable to Peter Lorre in Fritz Lang's M. Excellent editing and and a complex, skillful score contribute to making this one of the movies of the year and a classic of the thriller genre. Don't see it unless you have the nerve.

It seems when he was a teen, he fell in love with a girl who, as it turns out, was being molested by her father, and naturally, that caused all sorts of difficulties.  Unconsciously maybe, in order to understand how anybody could do such a thing, maybe Egoyan has tried since to use film to do that(although I won't state that as a fact; I'm no psychologist).What is clear in FELICIA'S JOURNEY is that, for the first part of the movie anyway, Egoyan is clearly more interested in telling the story of Hilditch, the caterer who is more disturbed than meets the eye, than in Felicia, the young woman he befriends.  If this were just a movie about Hilditch, maybe that would suffice.  But in the novel by William Trevor this is based on, even though Felicia's story is a familiar one(young, somewhat naive girl falls in love with boy her family doesn't approve of, he leaves, she gets pregnant, and tries to find him), her story is of equal importance to the story of Hilditch, and Trevor is interested equally in both of them.  The problem is Egoyan seems disconnected to Felicia's story, even though Elaine Cassidy is quite good in the role, so not only does the story go slack there, we start to question, as you didn't in reading the novel, how she could be so naive.Eventually, though, when Felicia ends up staying with Hilditch and gradually learns about him, the terror of the story, and the fact that, thanks to Egoyan, we're seeing her primarily through Hilditch, makes us care.  And, as I said, Cassidy is quite good.Of course, the movie belongs to Bob Hoskins as Hilditch.  Hoskins doesn't make the mistake of coming across as a sneering psychopath.  Instead, he trusts us to make our associations from past roles of his(THE LONG GOOD FRIDAY, MONA LISA) to realize there's something bubbling under this mama's boy, and concentrates on playing Hilditch on someone who genuinely believes he's doing good deeds here, and just want to help.  It also helps that Arsinee Khanjian, as Egoyan's wife, is quite good, and funny, as the domineering mother; you may never watch cooking shows the same way again.Egoyan also doesn't make a conventional Hollywood thriller as the movie draws to its conclusion.  What he substitutes is something which, admittedly, played out better in the novel because Trevor was able to stretch it out more, but it still chills you to the bone.  One may wonder why Egoyan took to a genre piece right after THE SWEET HEREAFTER, but he reworks it into a movie which does resonate.

The director of such great films as  Exotica, The Sweet Hereafter and Speaking Parts has ventured from his Canadian world to that of the British Isles. He does so effortlessly and again confronts an amazing story told in only the way he can.The film has the air of confidence from a film maker who has now truly found his rhythm and the ability to bring it to a mass audience.  He again starts with a dark theme and manages to keep his world secretive until the final frames keeping the audience riveted.  His amazing talent continues with the ability to elicit amazing performances from both established actors like Bob Hoskins and new faces like Elaine Cassidy as well as his ever lovely and talented wife, Arsinee Khanjian.Hoskins has one of this year's best performances.  The chilling Mr. Hildich would have been muddled by a lesser actor, turned into a poor man's Hannibal Lecter.  But Hoskins makes the character grow with the film, he only gets more menacing as the film progresses...but never too menacing that you can't feel for him.  Cassidy is equally skilled in bringing young Felicia to life. A young woman who is lonely and confused, but determined to see her dreams fulfilled.  Also a special mention should be given to Claire Benedict who plays Miss Calligary...a missionary who never quite knows when to quit...even for her own good.The story does unfold in a series of flashbacks, so those with short attention spans may need to avoid this film.  But in doing so, they would rob themselves of an amazing story.A key element to the film is Mychael Danna's musical score for the film. Music is used much more as a key player in the film than Egoyan has used in the past.  It works greatly to his advantage.This film was the opening night to the 24th Toronto International Film Festival...it was an incredible way to begin the fest.  It certainly will be remembered by me for many years to come.  Thank you Mr. Egoyan.

Not in a thousand years would I have expected a film like this from Egoyan. We've left Canada, for god's sake; a lovely country, some very talented and multi-talented people there, especially most -- it often seems to me -- of Hollywood's greatest actors and actresses. But to travel across the Atlantic -- Egoyan hasn't done that before. And this plot is character-driven (like Next of Kin) -- and not always shouting at you Hey, I'm a strange and brilliant director presenting all this odd stuff for you. Egoyan's penchant for films within films and pictures within pictures and other eccentricities don't distract,this time -- they remain, but much diminished, muted. And it works. Tremendously well, in fact. Families -- that's what Egoyan does best, what he knows most deeply -- how wonderful it is when they work, how deeply we need their sustenance. But how terrible, cruel, sometimes funny, but more often monstrous the effects parents have on their children in so many cases. Hoskins has been so great, so often before, can it really be surprising he's especially excellent here? A fine film; the old Peter Lorre film M comes to mind, his role somewhat comparable to Hoskins' here -- but many differences exist between these works. Felicia's Journey is amazingly beautiful to watch, idyllic at times; we see Felicia's inner and outer beauty first through our own eyes, then increasingly through Hoskins' character's odd lens. There's beautiful countryside to view. We have both hope and menace -- something slightly askew -- a spicy mix. The mundane, the commonplace are pleasantly present, but murder and madness hover very near. Entirely, hypnotically compelling; that's the best summation. And wonderful.

I had heard his name before and I knew that the movies he makes are often very good, but you just can't see them all, can you? Still, I'm glad that I finally got to see one and I must say that I'm already a fan of his work. If his other movies are as good as this one, than I almost can't wait to see those too.The title Felicia's Journey already tells something about what to expect from this movie. It tells the story of an Irish girl that is making her way from Ireland to England, to find her boyfriend who moved there to get a job in a lawn-mower factory. On arrival she meets a lonely middle-aged catering manager, called Hilditch, who recommends a boarding room to her. But Hilditch is a bit of a strange man. Even though he seems very nice and polite, he's always alone and seems to spend hours on studying tapes of an eccentric TV chef called Gala. Gradually we learn that the man has a much darker side than what we and Felicia at first assume...Even though he could easily have made a horror movie out of this subject or perhaps even worse, a TV-movie (it has something to do with having a bad youth, murder,...), Atom Egoyan has made the excellent choice of focusing on the drama and studying the characters with flashbacks. And by only slowly allowing the viewer to get some new information, rather than to give away everything at once, he builds up tension very well. But a good story isn't enough to make a good movie of course, some fine performances by all the actors are needed as well. Despite the fact that I didn't really know Elaine Cassidy (I only saw her play in The Others before), I must say that she is a pleasant surprise. She really did a very nice and convincing job with this role. The same can be said about Bob Hoskins. Him I know a lot better, but he too surprised me. He was so good in his role as Hilditch, that it took me quite some time to believe that it was really this man who did those horrible things.Overall this is a very fine movie with some excellent performances and a very interesting story. I'm convinced that there will be several people who will not like it for several reasons, but personally I liked it a lot. For me it wasn't too slow and I stayed focused from beginning until the end. And as this movie shows, you always have to be patient. Its power doesn't lie in the beginning or in the middle. Only when it is finished, you'll fully understand what has happened. That's why I give this movie a rating in between 7.5/10 and 8/10.

It was a difficult film to watch because the pacing that Egoyan has implemented is unlike any other film that I have seen. His use of the camera to create that uneasy sensation on screen and while watching the film was very impressive. Hoskins gives the performance of his career as this very controlled man with a very dark secret while Elaine Cassidy impressed me with her simplistic portrayal of Felicia. This was a brilliant film, but there were just some scenes and elements that didn't seem to match the rest of the film. The ending in particular was a bit misleading and at times rushed, but everything building up to that point really hit a strong nerve. If you were to define the word thriller, I don't think that you could do it without mentioning this film. Brilliant acting, an interesting use of direction (which worked very well), and a story that allowed itself to be build upon during each scene are just a few of the great moments (that overshadow the poor) in this movie.Felicia's Journey would not have been the powerhouse that it was if it was not for the powerful acting by Bob Hoskins who completely engulfed this character and showed us this rare glimpse of evil humanity. While I am sure that some of it is due in part by Egoyan's direction, but you cannot keep your eyes off Hoskins whenever he is on the screen. He builds his character so well, and bit by bit, that you never can anticipate what will he will say or do next. That is what is brilliant about Hoskins. Normally, when you have a troubled soul like Hilditch you can sometimes guess what he is going to do next. Actors sometimes fall into a pattern of repetition, but with Hoskins it was as if we were watching the final chapter and there were bigger events taking place. He also worked so well with Cassidy that at times I had forgotten that I was watching a film. His ability to be this sinister father figure to this girl was impressive. Hoskins really built this beautiful family dynamic to the film that I never saw coming. Outstanding performances by both that any film connoisseurs should not miss.Taped onto the vintage acting is this deeply engrossing story that pours from the bottle like some freshly corked wine. The simplicity of the story allows the complexity of the characters emerge and be triumphant. The story gives our characters layers upon which we gradually peel away. Hoskins character especially. From the opening scene until the final, I felt as if I was given the whole course, and not just bits and pieces. While Felicia's name does take the title of this film, it is Hoskins whom this story is really about. We learn more about his life, and his struggles than we do with Felicia. Yet, the story does not stop there. I found it quite interesting that Felicia father caused her conflict, while a matriarchal figure challenged Hilditch's perception. I thought that Egoyan was really trying to do more than tell a serial killer story (as the box may reveal) by giving us these strange and strangled family moments. I felt as if this was more a story about family, then it was about the horrors of humanity &#133; or perhaps it was a slice of both. Either way, the story is the foundation to this picture, and for the first time it really worked. So many times we go to the theater expecting to be blown away by a creative and empowering story, but this time it was a polar opposite. The acting is what kept this film high above water, while the story (as simple as it was) only helped build Hoskins and Cassidy further into the world of impressiveness.Finally, there was Egoyan behind the camera doing what he does best. I have seen only one of his other films, Exotica, and he is notorious for building the suspense from behind the camera as well as in front. His choice of panning in the wrong direction, the colors surrounding our characters and the sound of the film hit our nerves before any actors even walk into the picture. This is all coming from Egoyan's mind, which continues to impress me with each film that I view. I cannot wait to see more of his work and to see how well he has developed with each project. You can definitely see the Hitchcock influence that has been imprinted with Egoyan. I finished watching Frenzy (by Hitchcock) right after this film and the similarities were uncanny. Egoyan reminds me of a cross between Hitchcock and von Trier. His bold style makes each film his own, yet he is not afraid to be brutally honest and attributive to the cultural setting. He is a true filmmaker that needs to continue to prove that you don't need millions to create a masterpiece.While I have given credit to everyone, and thing, that deserves it in this film, I must finish this review by saying that this film was not perfection on a stick, but very close. There were some unfinished ends that could have been tied better, and the ending just felt as if there was this outside influence at work that Egoyan was battling. Up until the final twenty minutes of this film, I was thoroughly enjoying what I was seeing, but when the idea of religion was brought in from left field, I felt the final moments were rushed and forced. I needed something just as dramatic, just not so random. Also, I needed some form of conclusion to Felicia's actual journey. Did she find what she was looking for? Overall, I was very impressed with this film.Grade **** out of ***** "},{"Title":"Where's Johnny?","Date":"5 December 2010","Score":"6 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":" Joe Hilditch, the head chef for an industrial complex, is a remarkable cook. He runs the kitchen with a sense of propriety, striving to do the best job he can do.

Joe follows the recipes exactly; he loves eating the creations inspired by Gala.Felicia, a young Irish girl, is seen arriving in England. She is looking for Johnny Lysaght, her boyfriend, that according to her father, has decided to go to England to join the British army, something her old man holds against him because of a natural dislike for anything from the neighbor country. Felicity defies her father to go looking for Johnny. Fate brings Joe and Felicia together in such a strange way, she will be changed forever.In flashbacks from the tapes Joe watches, we realize his relation to the television gourmet cooking lady. Not only that, but Joe is also fond of videotaping young women he becomes in contact with. Felicia, who has no clue as to what is going around her, is oblivious to Joe's real intentions. Sadly, the story turns into something one sees coming, hoping Felicia is spared a terrible end.Atom Egoyan, who adapted the original material, made a wonderful transfer of the novel to the screen. As he accomplished with The Sweet Hereafter, Mr. Egoyan, shows an affinity to the William Trevor's text in a film that stays in one's memory because of his marvelous take on the characters of the book. He remains true to the original work, expanding it for the big screen in a satisfying film.Bo Hoskins has one of the opportunities of his career impersonating Joe Hilditch. As a matter of fact, the young actor chosen to impersonate the young Joe, bears an uncanny resemblance with the actor. Elaine Cassidy makes a wonderful Felicia, the young woman that does not have any idea of what she is getting into. Arsenee Khanjian, does a tremendous contribution as Gala, the television master cook whose program has been kept for posterity.Atom Egoyan, one of the best Canadian filmmakers gets better with every new project he becomes involved in.

We get the trademark video-equals-memory shots, the gorgeously complex camera movements, the somewhat muffled performances that appear in all of Egoyan's films. Hoskins is terrific, as always, but he's such a force he tends to drown out the young Elaine Cassidy's performance. So there's an imbalance here, also a problem in many Egoyan movies.

Besides the names of the two main actors and the movie title i don't know anything about the plot. Without preconceived ideas, i started to watch the film, letting Atom Egoyan unfold along two hours the characters, masterly played by Bob Hoskins and Elaine Cassidy.

He killed all those *lost* girls, because he wanted to help them, to protect them. He didn't want all them to continue living a loveless live, a sad live, a lonely life, like him. Cause like we see in all the videos of Gala's (his mother) program he hadn't nothing. Yes, he lived well, but he has no love from his mother. The only thing he obtained from her was recipes and food. And that's the only thing he has now. A good thing in Egoyan films, is that he tolds a story, but leaving a lot of questions without response. That's what a lot of people hates, and after seeing this movie, instead looking for answers, the just say what this f****** movie is about? it doesn't tell anything.

At times the film has a mesmerizing pull, but director Egoyan too often stalls things with needless flashbacks that provide information the audience has already come to understand, or tries to invest trite scenes with a revelatory significance that just isn't there. It climaxes awkwardly and absurdly with a delirious depiction of two religious crusaders being more monstrous than Hoskins' character himself. Egoyan labors to establish some pre-conscious link between the girl and the killer, contrasting Hilditch's (Hoskins) warped, twisted innocence with Felicia's pure, unspoiled variety. He just can't quite pull it off though, as there is no escaping the conviction that what Hilditch has been doing (luring unhappy girls into his car, befriending them on videotape, then killing them) is repugnant beyond comprehension. In fact, that is probably the most tired, hoary theme in movies today that the seemingly cold-blooded killer or assassin or whatever is just doing his job or is really no different than you or me. Oh really? How fascinating.Despite Egoyan's sumptuous visuals, I found myself focusing on the many plot holes due to his studied (some have found it hypnotic) pacing. How in the world did Hilditch attach a name to a face when it comes to tracking down Felicia's boyfriend? Why doesn't the boyfriend recognize Felicia at the pub? How can Hilditch be sure that Felicia wouldn't suspect him as the person who stole her money? True, she's gullible and trusting but he WAS alone with her bag in the car. There's no way he could've known she'd leave her bag out of sight anywhere else; in fact it's highly unlikely that she would. And why in the world don't the abducted girls he's giving rides to just escape by jumping out of his car? You can clearly see on the videotapes that he's driving slowly in populated areas, and you never see him using a gun. These are the sorts of things that really stand out when the central story isn't quite working.Felicia's Journey certainly isn't a total failure and I admire some of the chances it takes, but ultimately it fails to work because the two approaches are at odds with each other. That is, the microscopically observed psychological stuff dehydrates the thriller elements (and at times, the movie is clearly trying to pump up the suspense and WANTS to be a nail-biter) and the thriller elements trivialize the dramatic breakthroughs.

The best reason for seeing it is Elaine Cassidy as Felicia, the innocent abroad, who's very natural and credible (and very pretty).  Bob Hoskins gets a chance to do something different as Hilditch, and - especially by contrast with that natural quality Cassidy has - seems studied. It's a technically excellent performance and there are some fine, subtle bits, but - perhaps because of his sheer familiarity as an actor - I was always conscious of his accent as put on; I admired but wasn't drawn in.Much the same is true of the rest of the movie, with its adroit control of narrative structure, trademark flashbacks aplenty, and its handsome cinematography. (Ironically its saturated colours often make industrial Birmingham look as beautiful in its way as the conventionally picturesque Ireland; I'm not sure if that was the plan.)  The music tends to alienate one too there are some very oddly scored scenes that struck me as over-wrought and intrusive; perhaps they were meant to evoke the disorder inside the mind of Hilditch, but if so I think that was a misjudgment.So, worth seeing, especially for its often mesmerizing early scenes; it's just a pity that the pay-off doesn't pay (I can't say too much more about why that is without going into spoiler territory, but the problems are with the conception of the Bob Hoskins character). A pity, after Egoyan's fine The Sweet Hereafter, that the material here just wasn't strong enough.

Films like Exotica and The Sweet Hereafter are brilliant because of their intelligent and understated portrayals of disturbed, emotionally destroyed individuals.  He denies the characters on screen shows of emotion, forcing the audience to feel the emotion for them.  And we feel that emotion because we know and understand the emotional drive behind each character, (dead children in both films) therefore it doesn't need to be seen.  In Felicia's Journey, there is very little emotional drive behind the events in the picture.  The build-up is brilliant, Atom at the top of his form.  Fuzzy video images, horrifying flashbacks for Hoskins, eerie music from Mychael Danna, Arsinee as the mother from hell.  But with the lack of any real emotional tension comparative to his earlier works, the ending simply fizzles.  It is dull and boring, narratively as well as stylistically.  If you were to only watch the last half of the film you would not be able to tell it was an Egoyan picture.  That's because it isn't.  He's forgotten what makes his pictures great.  It's not about the creepy video images and eerie music, it's about the intricacies of human nature that his films are able to reveal to us.

To track Johnny down, she sets sail across the Irish Sea and travels by land to Birmingham. Johnny has supposedly taken a job there in a lawn mower factory but actually has joined the British army. Felicia is on a wild goose chase in a place that she does not know.

Egoyan even makes a little nod to the other master of suspense, with the scene of  Hoskins bringing the drugged drink up the stairs, a scene that brings to mind  Hitchcock's SUSPICION. A great homage to the British thriller.

Basically middle-aged catering manager Joe Hilditch (Bob Hoskins) spends all his time studying tapes of eccentric French TV chef Gala (Arsinée Khanjian), and following her recipes. Meanwhile, young woman Felicia (Elaine Cassidy) is making her way from Irelandto find her boyfriend Johnny Lysaght (Peter McDonald), who moved to England to work in a lawnmower factory. On arrival, she briefly meets Hilditch, who recommends a boarding room to her, oh, and we see more of her relationship with Johnny in flashbacks. I certainly wasn't expecting it, but it is revealed to us (the audience) that he has in fact befriended and abused many other young women, and he has taped them! Oh, and he also has flashes of a horrible experience with being on TV with Gala as a child! He of course has his sites set on Felicia, but he won't do anything to her until she has gained his trust, helped her in her search, and persuaded her to abort a baby she will be having. He does eventually get to stage where he can make his move, and of course the next morning you see the blood on her night dress. He is quickly visited by the slightly crazy and religion obsessed woman who tries to make him be part of her path of happiness, and I'm not sure but I think he saw the error of his ways, and he lets Felicia go, and hangs himself. Also starring Claire Benedict as Miss Calligary, Brid Brennan as Mrs. Lysaght, Gerard McSorley as Felicia's Father and Sheila Reid as Iris. This is what I like to refer to as the nut-case film, not exactly the same as them, to similar to the characters from films like One Hour Photo and Misery. Bob Hoskins was number 37 on The 50 Greatest British Actors. Very good!

YOU know SOMETHING will happen, but Egoyan does not take the easy and rather tried-and-true way out.

FJ is not Atom Egoyan's best film (personally, I think The Sweet Hereafter is a masterpiece), but it's much better than e.g. Exotica. Bob Hoskins is absolutely brilliant in this film as is Elaine Cassidy. However, calling this film a thriller is a stretch. Felicia's Journey is very much a drama, a serial killer drama, not a serial killer thriller. That's what is so great with this film, since it lets us meet the murderer on a whole other level than in most thrillers. Great film, brilliant acting.

Her father strongly disapproves of this relationship and in the end abandons her completely. She goes to England, by herself, relying on the kindness of a middle aged chef Joe,(Bob Hoskins), in order find her boyfriend. Joe's obsession is watching an old show with an eccentric French cook, and copying her complicated recipes. He is slowly unmasked as a serial stalker of vulnerable young women, that were in similar cases of Felicia's.The film is set in a very grim and grey-clouded world where parents systematically abuse, neglect, disown or molest their children, or simply try to control their children like puppets and as a result, they either get killed or become killers. Joe's mother, the French cook, basically failed as a mother by neglecting him and abused him by shoving stuffing in his mouth when he made a mistake while helping her on her TV show. Joe's victims seem to come from all sorts of backgrounds, all with one similarity, they come from a hard family lives. Joe is ultimately a victim like Felicia and all those who have been left to fend for themselves in a harsh and cruel world, which is the sad case of reality in many families around the world.The director does the right thing in concentrating on the character's emotions rather than pull the same old boring thriller/horror situations you find in so many American movies. Many films rely on the action, rather than the humanity of characters, which is why so many of the films nowadays are unfortunately just plain weak.

Bob Hoskins' character lives under the shadow of the memory of his monstrous mother, a 1950s TV cook; but the film's other themes also appear dated an Ireland in the continued grip of Catholic insularity, first generation Jamacian-British immigrants, even Birmigham as a manufacturing centre; all of these seem subjects that belong to another time. And while Egoyan assembles a visually satisfying picture of this world, the soundtrack is sometimes intrusive and the plot is stymied by the fact that Hoskins' character is just too odd to attract the sympathy necessary to balance that which the viewer naturally has for the eponymous Felicia. Overall, it has the feeling of a short story padded out to make a full-length film; although there's a nice atmosphere of Gothic horror in the climax. Still, if you haven't seen it, you'd be better watching 'The Sweet Hereafter', Egoyan's finest film.

The way that Atom Egoyan changes to the focus of the film really helps it, in that it's so skilfully done that you don't realise the change until it's already happened, and by then; it's easy to be captivated by the central character. The thing is, we know throughout what's coming, but because of the relaxed and sombre first hour, it creeps up on the audience and so even though we knew it was coming, the sickness of the central character still comes across shockingly. One film that this can be likened to is the brilliant 10 Rillington Place, as both films breath a very similar atmosphere. The plot follows a young girl, who travels to England from Ireland in search of her boyfriend, whom she believes now works in a lawnmower factory. She soon meets a kindly old man by the name of Hilditch. However, appearances can be deceiving and it isn't long before it becomes apparent that this man has abducted a string of young girls, and he now has his sights on this one...The main reason that this film works is courtesy of a brilliant creepy performance by Bob Hoskins in the role of the sinister Hilditch. Hoskins is a great actor, and roles like this really suit him. He obviously likes to star in gritty films as realistic characters, and although this one is over the top in terms of normal social conventions, Hoskins still manages to give the character a grounding in reality, which ultimately makes the horror aspect of the movie all the more potent. His female co-star is Elaine Cassidy, who is all sweetness as the innocent young girl he befriends. Her performance helps to exemplify the idea of naivety and how people appear and how they really are can be very different. It's not themes that Egoyan really seems to be going for, however, which is shown by the way that the focus is always on the characters themselves rather than the situation. The fact that a lot of the film is spent on flashbacks explaining how the characters got to where they are shows that quite clearly. Overall, this film is definitely one of the better ones to come out in the 1990's, and if you like your films with great acting, even better directing and a sinister atmosphere; I'm sure you'll find lots to like here.

He recreates Felicia's increasing desperation as she tries to find the young man who has got her pregnant, the claustrophobia of the web that apparently harmless Mr. Hilditch weaves around her. You know there's something not quite right about him, but the whole story gives itself up slowly.Egoyan strays from the book in the introduction of Hilditch's mother, a 1950s TV cook (a kind of pre-feminist Delia Smith). We see her in flashback and on the videos Hilditch slavishly follows when he's preparing food. Frankly, I don't think that this adds anything - is it meant to explain why he's like he is? Trevor feels no need to explain Hilditch's behaviour, which makes him more of a monster and much scarier.The only other thing that slightly spoils what is otherwise a superb film is the heavy handed use at times of a mystical sounding, sub Clannad soundtrack, which is meant to invoke Irishness, but is totally unnecessary.But those really are small complaints. Hoskins is excellent as a man who preys on vulnerable girls, and Cassidy is phenomenal in what was her first main picture. Incredibly, she was only 18 when she made it.

The story I would argue evolves more around the character of Mr. Hilditch (Bob Hoskins) than that of the title character, Felicia. By looking into the psche of this fascinating character, Egoyan creates perhaps the greatest pschological thrillers I have ever seen. The Hitchcockesque style (listen for the Psycho music) of a long developing plot and the creation of a character for an inanimate object- like Mr. Hilditch's house- contributes emensely to the films effect. As I continued to watch the character of Mr. Hilditch I became ever more reminded of Norman Bates, but here I believe the viewer gets an even deeper psychological investigation than that provided by Hitchcock- courtesy of Robert Bloch- in Psycho. The implied involvement of Hilditch's mother as a reason for his actions again can be related to... you know what film. In my opinion, Hoskins definintely deserves an oscar nomination for his incredible job playing the tragic lonely soul. Egoyan's use of symbolism and juxtapositions, such as the difference between the plush pastoral scenes of Ireland and the shots of industrial England, gives the careful viewer lots to consider. These contrasts contributed to a theme of creation and destruction that is continued throughout the movie.I would recommend this film to anyone of my friends, it stimulates alot of contemplation and exemplifies why Atom Egoyan should be considered one of the top filmmakers of the past decade.

The music is particularly effective, and the look has a certain ominous feel even in the scenes where characters would normally be at peace with nature.This movie was so riveting and engrossing because it kept building up by revealing more about the mysterious main characters. It goes about doing this in a manner that makes the film more interesting by opening up possibilities instead of closing them. As we get more of an idea of who these people are, the tension mounts because we can see the movie is leading to a major disaster, but we aren't sure what and when.The flashbacks and transitions between the two main characters are so effective. The flashbacks slowly reveal what caused the characters current traumatized state (their main similarity is it's one parent, but they don't know of this similarity), while the transitions emphasize comparisons between the two. Hoskins performance is really the key because he has most of the lines. He does an exceptional job, changing a little bit with each revelation about his character. By the end of the story, he's nothing like the guy that you thought he was at the very beginning, but the changes are totally credible. Although I mentioned he has most of the lines, the most impressive thing about his performance is the believability of the emotions he's portraying throughout this dialogue because his character is one that generally doesn't say what he's really thinking and feeling. On some occasions, his intense feeling is really obvious. In a lot of others though, it's buried beneath the skin as the point is the topic of conversation or the other persons actions have caused something to stew inside of him but his character is trying his best not to boil over. Cassidy is highly impressive because she's able to convey the all the emotions without many lines, especially since all her lines are purposely delivered with the same unassuming nature and low key tone. As is one of the trademarks of characters in Egoyan's movies, she also has a dualism in her actions and words where we kind of believe more toward the opposite is actually true. We aren't really sure, but we can see that something is beneath the surface. It's hidden just enough so that the person she's with doesn't see it. Depth, subtlety, and what lies beneath are definitely the strengths of this movie and Egoyan's cinema in general.The movie really stands out because you could see how easily it would have been another boring and predictable thriller had it been made in Hollywood. Hoskins would have been much more narrowly defined so he could be a clear-cut villain. The narrative would have been dumbed down and told in a more conventional style. The director would feel he had to insert some happy or comical moments that would only water down the intensity and weaken the portrayals of these characters. The temptation to totally leave the psychological level and have Hoskins chase Cassidy around his house with a sharp object at the end would have been too great. Luckily, it wasn't made in the land of the rehash, so it was a somewhat challenging movie that stayed true to its roots from start to finish.Aside from leaving Canada, I don't see why people think this is so different from Egoyan's other famous films, Exotica & The Sweet Hereafter. The core ideas, style, and presentation are all here. Like those other two, this is an excellent film that's one of the years 10 best. 9/10 "},{"Title":"One of 1999's most exquisite films, not to be missed.","Date":"20 July 2000","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":"  After experiencing Egoyan's films Exotica and The Sweet Hereafter, it seems his films can only get better and better.

I have yet to see a film by Egoyan I don't like, and this is no exception. They're all moody, tend towards the dark, alienated, and full of unspoken thoughts and emotions. However, this one has a slightly edgier, David Lynch sort of feel to it. Things that appear normal, sweet or soft are not so. Motivations are hidden. Actions aren't as linear as they appear. Felicia is a young Irish girl who is pregnant, rejected by her family, and leaves for England to find her so-called boyfriend who loves her. She meets an older man who offers his help to find the future father&#133; at least it appears so&#133; maybe it IS so. She DOES need help&#133; more and more. This is an evenly paced, slowly swirling story that asks you to watch for subtle changes and hints of things to come. It is part suspense story, and heavy on the psychological drama. Hoskins is gentile, obsessive, anachronistic, and eerie as hell. Cassidy is fragile, pretty, and glowing in honesty.

Close attention to faces, like Hitchcock or Scorsese. You feel like you know these people and feel the pain they feel, with not much screen time. That's a credit to both the leads, but even the bit players manage to convey a lot with little time.Unlike some reviewers I find the transformation of the main character, Hoskins (spoiler follows!), quite believable. This is a mind controlled by rituals and symbols, and he already knows that Felicia is not like his other victims, because she came willingly into his house. He seems to regret what he's about to do, and he admits when pressed by the evangelists that he's not a good man, and that he stole her money to keep her close to him. Had she cried out or been rescued by them, it would have been a hackneyed chance ending. Having him open the door, accept the redemption promised by the Christians, and having her stare a long last stare at him before departing, seems to me the perfect ending. She makes a choice rather than panicking, and this seems to render her calm at the epilogue believable and refreshing. Like anyone who's been through a terrible trauma, even (in her mind the abortion is) complicit in one, they learn to re-form their identity around events and cope. He (Hoskins) killed her unborn child as he killed those other women. She was a witness, merely. She does not condemn herself for falling for his lies. Nor even condemn him. He's just a sick thing, best out of the world and on to accepting the redemption of the next, before he can do more harm, before he can recant. All of this makes sense from her (more religious) and his (more desperate) point of view. It's a great ending. I don't know why anyone would consider it rushed, unnatural or whatever. Hoskins' character himself comments on the chance events that cause outcomes to occur very differently. For instance, if Felicia were to turn her head in the pub, she'd see her man. But she doesn't. This alone determines the fate of her child. Or if she were not kicked out of the hostel, she would not have returned to his house. And so on. I don't think a story like this is problematic for ending on yet another turn of fate. In many ways, the story is about exactly that kind of turn, and Hoskins' character seems formed by many such turns himself - mostly wrong ones. Except at the end, where he makes the right choice.It's almost as if Egoyan is commenting on the fragility of lives led by rituals and symbols, and how chaotic our lives become if we get tied up with those who lose track of empathy as their moral guide. How sad that is. Hoskins' return to his boyhood, in black and white, at his own end, demonstrates how lonely his life has been outside the rituals and symbols of his mother's cooking show. Makes me shudder at child stars.

Despite the title, a big chunk of the film concerns itself with the multi-layered Hilditch. Living in a world that's purposely isolated from reality after what we presume to be the death of his mother, Hilditch's obsession with watching and replicating to the second his mother's cookery programmes from the 1950s is the first indication that he is not what he seems.In fact, first of all, as you watch Felicia's Journey, Hilditch seems normal, mundane, stuck in an uninteresting job, but he is far from what he seems. When Felicia - arriving from Ireland in search of an absent boyfriend - first crosses paths with Hilditch, he seems to take the sort of fatherly interest that seems quite touching and she - being so naive and trusting - accepts these repeated chance meetings as just that, chance. As the film continues, Felicia staying with Hilditch, you slowly see his true character revealed through little flashbacks, and Felicia never realises the full extent to which she is being manipulated and why. Beauty and the beast might not be quite the right comparison, but perhaps innocence and malice is. So skillful is Hilditch's subtle persuasion - always telling Felicia that she must make her own decisions - that she finally comes to make a choice that is probably appropriate for her present without actually wanting to. When I watched the film for the second time with my mum, she picked up on a lot that I'd overlooked. We see by the end of the film that Felicia is happy, but what happened to her search for boyfriend Johnny? Did she ever return to Ireland? Did she ever see her dad again? The ending is powerful, but maybe just a bit too enigmatic. In the penultimate scene, all Felicia has is a cotton nightdress. No money, no friends to go to, not even a coat. I presume that the audience is to assume that a good Samaritan took her in - but would she trust another stranger after her experience with Hilditch? I'm still not sure about that.Felicia's Journey is an excellent film, but there were many significant loose ends that would have benefited from being tied up in the climactic minutes. The end of a film is a time to clarify what was unclear before - the ending of Felicia's Journey is positive but doesn't quite tie up all the plot lines that were introduced at the start. "},{"Title":"An unsettling experience","Date":"14 March 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":"  The intriguing factor on a first viewing of Felicia's Journey is not knowing where it is all leading to.  Scenes of an Irish girl leaving Ireland for England to look for her boyfriend alternate with those of a middleaged factory catering manager somewhere in the darkest Midlands.  Even those involving the latter alternate between sequences of him normally going about his duties at his place of work and those of him off-duty strangely preparing ambitious meals for himself alone, following, step by step, videos of old TV programmes conducted by an over the top female chef.  Just who is this strange little man and how is he going to tie in with the Irish girl's quest for the lover whose child she is bearing?  It all makes for an exercise in audience manipulation almost worthy of Hitchcock in places.  Canadian director, Atom Egoyan, also shares with Hitchcock in his middle to late period, a fascination for landscapes, his camera slowly panning across the industrial vistas of gasometers, cooling towers and factories that are part and parcel of the Black Country.  When, a short way into the film, the paths of the caterer and the Irish girl meet, the dual narrative joins up but we are still none the wiser about the path events will take.  There are hints that we could be in Psycho/Peeping Tom -land but the tone is altogether quieter.  Menace has been subtly swapped for unease.  We are presented with an almost benign psychopath for a change so that we fear less for the girl's safety than how she will get by in an alien landscape without money and with her search for her boyfriend appearing ever more fruitless.  Although, as the film progresses, we are given more and more grounds to fear for her safety, there is more the tone of frustrated nightmare in our identifying with the girl's apparently hopeless material circumstances that the old dark house - woman in terror stuff.  Egoyan, who is usually into much more serious works (Exotica, The Adjuster and - finest of all - The Sweet Hereafter) is indulging in something of a divertissement in Felicia's Journey.  It is not a film that adds up to anything very much but the viewing of it is quite unsettling.  To do this as well as it is done here is no mean achievement.

He meets Felicia, a young woman who has come to Birmingham from Ireland to find her one time boyfriend with news of her pregnancy.  Hilditch helps her but increasingly plays a role to keep her in his life for as long as he can.I must admit that much of my interest in this film was held by the fact that it was filmed partly in my adopted home town of Birmingham.  Set around Nechells we have the gloomy presence of the gas works, the tower blocks of Aston and the industrial estate landscape of both.  Locals will also recognise the bottom of Gravely Hill as the location of the B&B and the external of The Barton Arms pub and The Electric Cinema (a supporter of Egoyan's films!).  Aside from this location spotting I was drawn into the film by the mood of unease that was set throughout.  The director uses music, the performances and the locations to good effect.  The music is good except when the film flashbacks to Ireland &#150; then it becomes clichéd panpipe stuff.  While in Birmingham the film presents the landscape as bleak and foreboding &#150; it has none of the greens and openness that are clearly displayed in Ireland.  Even the orderly house of Hilditch has an air of otherworldliness to it.However the film doesn't manage to do as much as you'd hope with this atmosphere.  While the characters are pretty well painted, not everything is fully resolved or explained.  In fairness this is not a major problem as very few of Egoyan's films will lay everything out for you &#150; mostly you have to put in work yourself, something I didn't totally do here.  The plot is good when it focuses on Hilditch but then stutters when flashing back to Ireland or leaving him out of the film for too long.  His character is complex and, while we're not sure the depth of his soul until the end, we do know he is messed up a little at least.  The `why' is not totally solved but his character is still good and pretty well delivered by Hoskins.Aside from a pretty weak Birmingham accent (and in support roles too) he fills the character with a desperate longing that actually overcomes the sinister side of him.  It would have been easy to have painted this guy a nutter but Hoskins helps us feel for him a little, making his aim all the more interesting.  Cassidy is OK as the title character but she is not as interesting as Felicia and tended to fall out of my mind when she was off-screen.  The best scenes are those between the two leads.Overall this is not a perfect film but I did find it quite watchable.  The mood set by the director works very well and has a good uneasy feel to it all the way.  This is greatly helped by Hoskins who, at once, manages to be a harmless little man but also a quite unhinged person who video tapes young runaways in his car.  The fact that the film doesn't totally manage to bring things to an end is perhaps not as big a weakness as I thought when you consider that few things in life are tidy when they involve complex personalities and relationships.

They hang about in Brum looking for her absent beau.Okay, on to Egoyan. In this film and The Sweet Hereafter, I see an obsession with clear visuals which interface with natural landscape, and a lyrical whimsical quality which looks to the regrets and lessons of people passing through life. Ho-hum. But why on earth does he find simple ciphers of positivity and negativity? I'm not saying that the characters are portrayed as simply good or bad, it's just that their traits are too basically delineated as such. The picture postcard depictions of Eire don't carry the conviction of a filmmaker who really wants to look at the complexity of a familiar background, and the 'city carries bad things' stance is simply an expansion of the over-simplified depiction of corruption afflicting Ian Holm's daughter in The Sweet Hereafter. Egoyan's stylisms at the same time ground with the 'foreign' (for him, and Felicia) backdrop of Brum, yet this is subverted by a misplaced sub-world of '50s arcana which supposedly makes up Bob Hoskin's stunted existence. So this is no honest depiction of that city - just as dishonest as the idealisation of rural Ireland.Both leads give good performances, but Felicia's role of innocence doesn't warrant much depth. The role of the 'killer', though, is probed heavily but results only in throwing into sharp relief a painful simplicity this odd man, complete with 'Psycho' mother issues, a misplacement of culture, a loner and liar, an unlikely good samaritan in the city - he simply has to have something 'wrong' with him. Even if he isn't a killer (the one clever possibility which Egoyan throws up), his wrongness is enough for him to be 'unnormal' (and consequently unable to end the narrative in an unpredictable manner). Scorsese's Taxi Driver gives more interesting possibilities for such a character (the disturbed fantasist), and makes Egoyan's character seem far less developed. The usage of technique to underline his 'disturbedness' (hugely grating musical score, contrived psychoreactions to 'ordinary' things like food) only highlight further either a huge distrust of audience judgement (they have to be shown what to feel) or an overbearing desire to make us question why technique is heaping such cliches on this character. I like the second possibility, as it says Egoyan is willing to think outside of the genre-constricted box regarding what to think of Hoskins (even if the characters themselves cannot), but the result is still too black and white.I'm not saying that Egoyan's a conservative director (or that there would be anything wrong with that), it's just that sometimes he is intuitively clever, but then seems to throw it all away for the making of a point, or a filmic expression. Odd occasions occur when the camera rises on its crane quite inappropriately to give us a vista of Brum and a character walking away - too, too set for pure effect, and so consequently alienating. And the idealisations (or polar demonizations) of memory can only make us question the filmmaker's honesty is mother so bad? is Ireland so sweet? is abortion another impurity? are the stories of the city (mainly through the prostitutes Hoskins pick up) all pain for him to absorb? Where's ennui - instead of belief in good and bad all the time? Felicia's closing voiceover clinches this crux of simplified tokenism - if it's not the bad life, she must be having the good life.If this review sounded negative, I should add that the film's actually not bad - interesting. I could think of far less interesting movies. It's just that Egoyan's outlook is as infuriating as it is fascinating. And certain moviemakers I initially found infuriating (I'm thinking Wong Kar-Wai) I now treasure. So *maybe* I will change my mind about this film...

However, after viewing this film on DVD I can say with all confidence that Felicia's Journey is the best excuse to ignore what critics have to say.Don't get me wrong.  I don't think this movie is for everyone.  Although Atom Egoyan had great success with The Sweet Hereafter,  it is too much to expect the same kind of universal praise for his more idiosyncratic films.  Not all of his films were as audience-friendly as The Sweet Hereafter.  I use the word audience-friendly for lack of a better word; that film was about a tragic school bus accident for goodness sake!I can understand why some people posted comments on this movie complaining that it is too weird.  There were several weird elements in this film, from Arsinee Khanjian's over-the-top performance as Hilditch's mother to the climactic face-off between Hilditch and Miss Calligary (a.k.a. the religious woman) But I loved all these weird moments in the film.  It gave it such a tense, unsettling feeling that is lacking in most conventional movies about serial killers.  For those of you who think Felicia's Journey is too weird, you should try watching Egoyan's earlier movies like The Adjuster and Speaking Parts!Although Felicia's Journey did feel long at some points, I must say that I was never bored during it.  I felt completely absorbed in the strangely uncomfortable relationship between Elaine Cassidy's Felicia and Bob Hoskins' Hilditch.  This movie did not have to have a bloody climax depicting a violent escape from Hilditch's clutches.  The abuses suffered by Felicia may have been subtle, but they were sufficiently disturbing.I highly recommend this movie, but I realize that it is not for everyone.  However, I do have to contend with the people who posted comments that complained that this movie was boring.  Atom Egoyan's films are certainly challenging, but never dull.

It is not surprising that the director of that Atom Egoyan is the director of that very movie. The Cairo-born storyteller of dark modern fairy tales obviously had his share in mainstream horror entertainment years ago when he started out as the director of Friday 13th- and Alfred Hitchcock presents - TV episodes. Since then he became one of the most acclaimed independent moviemakers and one of the last ones who really developed their very own cinematic style. Again, as in all his previous movies he tells the disturbing tale about a psychotic middle-aged kitchen chief and his latest victim from Ireland in a collage of past and present. The time lines are floating, memories and actual events blend over and the result is a very intimate view on two characters who are both in their own way very naive and innocent. Bob Hoskins gives a stunning performance as a man who is constantly haunted by his long dead, but still dominating mother. Once, the poor boy was forced to eat liver in front of millions of TV viewers who admired his mother' s famous cook show. He compensated the loss of love and warmth by becoming an expert in food himself, especially in food's temperature. But he also developed his strange way of helping unhappy souls - young girls who were abandoned by their lovers, their families, their employers, the world around them. With the reasoning of a veterinarian he puts them to sleep, finds them a last resting home five feet down below in the backyard of his garden. For him there is nothing cynical about his actions. He just tries to stop the pain he projects from his own suffering into these women' s lives. And so it is no surprise that he meets Felicia, the young Irish girl who really thinks that her boy-friend works at a lawnmower factory and has not joined the British Armee, giving up her love and his pride by living in the enemy' s country. Felicia is the first pure soul this serial killer meets, because she does not questioning the good in other people. She just believes in their friendship, protection, love, although nothing of that is actually true.  Egoyan does not need to have big suspense scenes with tons of blood to frightened his audience to the bones. He just stays true to this story which in itself reveals its horror by showing how fragile Felicia's dreams actually are. He is more interested in the psychological motives than in action and rightly is so, because although we rarely want to believe our eyes, we still can feel the deeper reality of this story. In the end, when the serail killer lets his last victim free, we really understand the salvation he received. This movie may be a little too slow for all those who wished Egoyan had more references to Hitchcock's early movies put into his movie than the one scene when Hoskins goes up the stairs with a poisoned glass of hot chocolate. But it really isn't slow. It tells it story in a reasonably length and to an admirable depth without any false sentimentality or overloading suspense elements.

If Torontonians don't stop encouraging this guy's ballooning delusion that he's on the same level as the Hitchcocks and Kubricks of this world (rather than being a modestly talented filmmaker whose early movies were pretty jolting and funny, particularly in the grim Canadian context), Atom will either implode, or become the most obnoxiously self-important motion picture artiste since the dreaded Peter Greenaway.

He's also obsessed with young female runaways, whom he sexlessly befriends--like Felicia (Claire Benedict), an Irish girl searching for the boyfriend who impregnated her, then left for England.The spuddy little mama's boy, and a British variant on Mia Farrow's Rosemary, stuck together in a musty, mother-haunted flat--Roman Polanski would find miles of cruel sniggers in this material. For some reason, the adapter-director Atom Egoyan has taken this thin, Alfred Hitchcock Presents material as an opportunity to display his talent for grandiose, fastidious omen-making. Long-held, wide-panning anamorphic shots mated to eerie-soothing New Age ululation, production design so prickly and perfect it makes Kubrick look like a slackoff--Egoyan is a master of technique, as this movie (like its predecessor, THE SWEET HEREAFTER) shows. But he sticks his tuning fork to a lot of amorphous bad vibrations in FELICIA'S JOURNEY; the movie feels like one of Kubrick's or Antonioni's bad-aura-in-the-wilderness movies like ZABRISKIE POINT or THE SHINING. Egoyan's point seems to be that the whole world is a tremulous coffee can stuffed with bad karma, just about to tip over the edge of the table. The hyperinflation and studiedness of his style seem out of keeping with the source material, which cries out for squealy black comedy. There are characteristic, why-is-that-funny? Egoyan moments--as when Hoskins invites Benedict to spend the night in a living room as flower-festooned as a mortuary.

What kind of man was he? To which the neighbors reply, &#145;a quiet man'.  Felicia's Journey is a lot like that.  Atom Egoyan's film is very similar to his The Sweet Hereafter in his portrayal of a solitary, tormented figure whose present actions are the direct result of past trauma.  Egoyan has also fitted the right character to play both roles, Ian Holm and now Bob Hoskins.  But the one weakness of Felicia's Journey is that Hoskins plays Joe Hilditch with such gentleness that we forget he is a diabolic killer.  Where there should be contempt for how he has violated the young woman,  Egoyan has substituted, instead, sympathy. That said, this film is a masterful account of troubled minds, lost souls, and the unyielding power of evil.  It is also deliberately sanitized of overt violence or torture and yet the frequent flashbacks and the disquieting music are reminders of its undertones.  Felicia's Journey is, finally, a film about contrasts - from the backdrop of  industrial polluting towers to the pounding noise of a factory where a seemingly civilized man finds time to give the employees the very best in culinary cuisine and from the sweetness of a &#145;red riding hood' who realizes only after the fact that she has visited the &#145;big bad wolf'.

Egoyan's method is hard to summarize, but one source I found put it in a way that makes enough sense when considering the bulk of Egoyan's work, He seems drawn to the notion of 'self fulfilment through intimacy'. Egoyan likes when characters talk to each other the way somebody addresses their psychiatrist. In Felicia's journey, the title character, leaves home in Ireland to go find her loved one in England, where he plans to enlist. Once on English shores, Felicia has trouble getting around. The only person who seems drawn to help her, is a middle aged factory chef, who lives alone, offers her a place to stay, and agrees to help look for her sweetheart. At the same time however, he is lying to her, claiming to be a widower among other things, trying to earn her sympathy, while deliberately going in circles over the search. Somehow he seems unwilling to let her go.In a way, Felicia's Journey is Egoyan's most disturbing film. Never before have I seen Bob Hoskins so deep in a role. I am more used to him as a superficial comedic face in such films as Hook, Brazil and Super Mario, Bros; although I am quite aware that he has done drama. Here he done a sensational job of a warm face to an utterly frigid character.Judging from the ending, Felica's Journey clearly has a message to leave us, but again I'm not sure what it is. Egoyan is unique in that the inability to interpret him feels more intriguing than annoying. The manner in which he draws you into a dark world of thought behind the story of this motion picture, is enough for me to call it an effectively tense, and well done drama.

Felicia, a teenage girl from a rural part of the Irish Republic, travels to Birmingham to find her boyfriend Johnny, who she believes works in a lawnmower factory. (In fact, Johnny has joined the British Army, but wants to keep this a secret, as the part of Ireland he comes from is a hotbed of Republican sentiment). Felicia (who, it transpires, is pregnant by Johnny) is befriended by a middle-aged man named Joe Hilditch, who works as a factory catering manager. At first Hilditch seems kindly and helpful, but it soon becomes clear that there may be sinister motives behind his interest in Felicia. In a series of flashbacks we learn of Felicia's life in Ireland and her relationship with her strict, moralistic father, and of Hilditch's own past. We learn that he is the son of Gala, a famous television chef from the 1950s. He is a curiously old-fashioned character; he regularly watches his mother's old black-and-white programmes, lives in her old house, which does not appear to have been redecorated or refurnished for about forty years, and drives an old Morris Minor which he refers to by the antiquated slang term jalopy. (Even when it was current slang, jalopy, meaning an old and dilapidated car, was primarily an Americanism, little used in Britain). He appears to have inherited not only his mother's house but also her culinary skills, cooking himself sumptuous meals, which makes one owner why he is not working in a smart restaurant or hotel rather than a factory canteen. As is common in social-realist cinema, the film paints a bleak picture of the industrial landscapes of Birmingham. Its picture of rural Ireland, however, is equally bleak, about as far from the sentimental Ballykissangel image as one can get, despite (or perhaps because of) the fact that the film was based on a novel by an Irish writer, William Trevor, who also wrote the screenplay. The Irish Republic we see here is a grim, cheerless place, dominated by a sectarian religiosity and bitter memories of who did what to whom in the 1920s, a place where a father can call his daughter a whore to her face if he disapproves of her choice of boyfriend.The brightest thing about this picture was the performance of the nineteen-year-old Elaine Cassidy as the determined if naïve young Felicia; I am surprised not to have heard more of her in the years since 1999. Bob Hoskins is suitably creepy and sinister as Hilditch, whom we first assume to be a sexual predator until we learn that he is in fact something far worse. There are, however, some things about his character that do not ring true. His strong working-class Brummie accent, for example, does not seem right on the lips of a man who lives in a large arts-and-crafts mansion and who, as the son of a wealthy celebrity, would doubtless have enjoyed a privileged education. Like a number of actors with a skill for reproducing various regional accents, Hoskins seems to enjoy showing off that skill even when the accent in question would not be entirely appropriate to his character. (I remember another film where he did a convincing imitation of a New York accent, which would have been fine had his character actually been from New York rather than California). More importantly- and here the fault lies more with the script than with the actor- we never really understand exactly what has happened to turn Hilditch into a serial killer, even though the idea of narrating part of his backstory was presumably to give us an insight into his psychology. If the implication was supposed to be that his eccentric mother, who used him as a sort of prop on her cookery shows, had left him with a hatred of women, this needed to be spelled out much more clearly. The film seems to have been intended as a psychological study- it is too slow-moving to work as a thriller- but is too mystifying really to work as such. The film has its points of interest, but overall it is one I found rather unsatisfactory. 5/10 "},{"Title":"Faithful adaptation of a terrific book","Date":"4 August 2003","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":"  Like the book, the movie takes awhile letting you know that you're involved in a thriller, but once you discover what's really going on with Bob Hoskins' character, the tension seems to rachet up 150% in seconds.

I am a Bob Hoskin fan and I enjoyed his performance.  The movie was quietly ominous like the Hoskin character but it never lived up to its potential.  The Hoskin character was built up to be a troubled , deadly, controlled fiend but the movie went nowhere with that build up.  Why have the character made out to be horrible and not use the horror in the movie.  I think showing him to be troubled was enough considering  where the movie went.   The movie was touching, not at all like it was advertised.  It would have been a better movie if it went for compassion.  Actually it did go for compassion at the end after a big build up of horror.  You were awaiting slashing and you got sap.  The false suspense ruined the movie.    Elaine Cassidy's performance was very good.  She seemed vulnerable and frail just the type the Hoskin character wanted.  The Hoskin character was portrayed as an anachronism.  Living in the 50's with his music and house decorations.  So what was the deal with the tapes and hidden camera   Where was the camera hidden in that little car so that none of the victims saw it?   For me the camera and taping of the other girls did not fit the Hoskin character.   The technology was too modern for this old fashioned guy.  Cinematic device was written all over the tapes of the girls.  Nor was the character's interaction with employees real.   The character seemed to have genuine caring relationships with the people he worked with but was portrayed elsewhere as being enclosed and lonely.  Too many contradictions for me.  The Hilditch character was not true to me and so the movie failed in engaging me.  I cared for the girl and her plight but the horrible Hilditch seem more plot device than person.

In Next of Kin Egoyan raised interesting questions about parent-child relationships. In Felicia he raises obvious questions and doesn't do much with them. He sets a difficult dramatic task by having two slow moving, internally oriented characters playing off each other. As a result the movie is glacial, often with one obvious idea strung out for minutes at a time. Bob Hoskins' performance is one- dimensional in this one, adequate for a shorter movie. In addition, Bob Hoskins' theme music was clichéd and unbearable, though the other music was very good. Elaine Cassidy is captivating, but the director could have done much more with her. In the modern world it is hard to imagine a young woman this passive. It's also hard to believe Bob Hoskins' character was smart or energetic enough to kill all the other women. On the other hand, Egoyan constructs his flashbacks very well, and offers rather effective if typical social critique. Cinematography is fine, setting choices are interesting.Some questions I had about the film are Did Bob's character kill his mother? Also, I'm not sure why he went to the trouble of finding Elaine's boyfriend.

He has a sublime intuition. The soul of this film is about humans as memory and film as memory. He folds memory and enfolds us in the process. Remembrances as TeeVee shows and illicit videos. Lost memories as murder. Pregnancy and food preparation conflated, and then related to headless sight. Sight as culture; `fabrication' as stolen religion. All this built with such fine multisymmetry that I feel blessed being exposed to this manner of visual breathing. The very recall just makes me glad to be alive.But then the man thinks and everything turns to raw liver. He's just not that bright and gets easily impressed with `investigating what it means to be human.' Gosh. So he takes oily sophomoric banalities and ladles them all over his beautiful crystals simple visual symbolism; vapid truths; synthetic paradoxes; staged ironies. What really ruined this film for me was watching it a second time with Egoyan's commentary. In it (dropped in among six thousand `you know's) is an articulation of life worthy of a high schooler infatuated with the wonders of acting.When I watched this without his `help,' I was able to ignore all the simple thematic mechanics and wonder at the subtlety of the eye and the remarkably sophisticated notion of memory and reference. The fluidity of stirred time. The consummate understanding of how to place a reference of one scene in the imagination of another in a different time and place. And that is the experience I wish on you dear reader -- so ignore the commentary.Someone needs to channel this man's intuitive eye away from his simple mind. We just don't have enough of these people to waste, people whose soul you can sometimes see reaching into their art while they aren't looking.He must be aware of this, as there is a strong self-referential tone. And much of the hammered mechanics that bothers me is about the contrast between hammered mechanics and natural grace (sense and sensibility).

A serial killer is this time watched through his slow trip from last victim to latest victim rather than in the middle of his killing sprees. The idea is to investigate what makes him like he is. We see his abundantly ridiculous French chef mother who treats him like a pet alternately punishing and smothering him with kisses or shoving raw liver down his throat. This is supposed to be the source of his affliction. We are treated to his obsessive attachment to his (deceased) mother through a series of preposterous evenings of food preparation while he watches her make the same meal on ancient videotape. The woman playing his mother has the most annoying French accent ever heard on film. I would have had to kill her myself had she been my mother, simply because of how she rolled her errrrrs. Meantime he befriends a naive and pregnant Irish teen for whom we figure he has something unpleasant planned. We watch the entire courtship which involves her desperate, if rather slow and pointless, search for the boyfriend who made her tummy stick out (which it never actually does in the film).

When the movie starts it looks good, but since we start understanding what he is doing to the girl... My problem with the movie, i guess, is not that it is slow (i don't mind that), is that it's all about the suffering of this innocent girl, who doesn't seem to be able to meet anyone nice or decent. Bad things is all that happens to her, while we are given no hint that it's gonna get better. I guess i cared to much about the character. And, by the way, the movie should really be titled Hilditch's Journey, since it ends up being much more about him then Felicia's. It almost feels like some of the things that happen to her are just a way to try and make it more thrilling and to just get the plot to move forward. I mean it's almost unbelievable the sucession of bad stuff that happens to her. It looked to me almost as exploitation. I was so mad at what the director and screenwriter made that girl go thru, that when Hoskins's character almost chockes to death i hoped he would die. And the end, well, it came too late.
