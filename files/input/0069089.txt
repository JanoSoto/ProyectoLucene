A college dorm had rented a print, and in a drunken state I've not achieved again this past quarter-century, I went to see it.  Having finally seen it again only recently, this time sober, I'm here to tell you... it looks a hell of a lot better when you're drunk.  Those who call it great or a masterpiece are plain wrong, they don't recognize what they are seeing.  The camera work is a hair's breadth above home movies; the acting and story are... well, they are better than in porn flicks and even some straight-to-video movies, but, jeez, not by much.  And then there is the primary purpose behind Pink Flamingos -- to make the most disgusting, revolting movie possible, perhaps even conceivable.       But... BUT... Pink Flamingos is distinctive.  Even if you - yes YOU out there - the reader, wanted to make the most disgusting movie in the world and even if you had the money and the skills that John Waters lacked in 1972, you couldn't make a film as good as he did.  Yes, GOOD!  You couldn't because, first of all, I doubt you have the same quality of acquaintances that Waters had and put into into his early movies.  And it's not just a matter of WHAT they will do, but HOW they do it.  Waters' actors had a style, no matter how bizarre, that is rarer than most depravities.  Could YOU recognize the virtues of, let alone even find, someone like Edith Massey?  I doubt it.  Which leads to the second point.     Pink Flamingos has panache!  It has a free-wheeling sense of daring-do that borders on innocent fun. So, although the movie is so disgusting that I wish it had never been made, it is not a squalid film.  And I don't think YOU, the reader, or anyone other than Waters could have pulled that off.  It doesn't make Pink Flamingos a masterpiece.  It does make it unlike any other film.

With an unparalleled level of notoriety -- based almost entirely on the final scene, the film has become a curiosity of sorts and a right of passage for those testing their own boundaries of decency. Beneath this seedy exterior however, lies a brilliant and biting satire of society's obsession with fame and the lengths one will go to in order to achieve it. This theme is relevant even more so today than it ever was. Just consider the over abundance of reality TV shows, for example 'Fear Factor' &#150; a show boasting contestants eager and willing to outdo one another by performing a variety of dangerous stunts and eating unimaginable specimens &#150; how is this any different than the characters in 'Pink Flamingos' attempting to outdo one another in an effort to claim the dubious title of the filthiest people alive? Society is (and has always been) captivated with sensationalism; from the Roman era and the coliseum packed with bloodthirsty audiences, to modern day and the likes of the 'Jerry Springer Show' (of which Babs Johnson and the Marbles would make excellent guests!!). The purpose of Pink Flamingos is to not only put a hilariously depraved spin on the fascination with celebrity but to also provide a cautionary tone to the dissolution of society itself. The performances are all top-notch; especially the ever-dependable and over-the-top Mink Stole, as heartless Connie Marble; and scene stealing Edith Massey, as Edie 'The Egg Lady'. It's amazing that the film is over thirty-years old because the message is just as fresh today as it was back in 1972.

Just how filthy can they be? Plenty the film includes everything from sex with chickens to what I can only describe as a remarkable display of rectal control to a heaping helping of doggie doo, and I guarantee that you won't want to eat an egg for at least several weeks after seeing it.The cast is either wonderful, atrocious, or atrociously wonderful, depending on how you look at it. The star, of course, is Divine... and to describe Divine as the BIGGEST drag queen on the planet would the understatement of the year. She is a mammoth creature given to BIG eye makeup, BIG orange hair, and BIG expressions--she is the Charleton Heston of drag, and whether she is almost running down a jogger, pausing to use the bathroom on some one's front lawn, or startling real-life shoppers by taking a stroll along a Baltimore sidewalk she is both unspeakable and unspeakably funny. Others in the cast include Mary Vivian Pearce, Danny Mills, and the ever-appalling Edith Massey as members of Divine's family; and Mink Stole and David Lochary as the white-slaving, baby-selling couple who challenge Divine's status.It should be pretty obvious that PINK FLAMINGOS is not exactly a movie that will appeal to just every one, and viewers who know director John Waters only through such later films as HAIRSPRAY and CRYBABY will be in for a major jolt. But if you want to see something so completely different that even Monty Python couldn't imagine it, this is the movie for you. Just make sure you eat before you see it, because you probably won't want to eat afterward--and you might want to keep a barf bag handy just in case.Gary F.

It is a film genre of it's own. I read and hear reviews of this movie that express disgust and horror and I picture John Waters chuckling. This was the intent, it was meant to upset the status quo and in politically correct times that we live in, isn't it a small surprise to see this film come to the forefront again? This is a movie that will freak out the uptight for as long as it exists in any media. It was meant to. As much as Clockwork Orange talked about ultraviolence this movie is all about ultra-bad taste. We can numb ourselves to sex and violence but Pink Flamingos is a movie you just will never get used to. There will be something in this movie that will get to you. As a last resort to make sure everyone is offended before you leave the theatre, John includes the always discussed poodle scene. No reason for this scene, except to make sure he gets you and also to make sure you leave talking about it. Obviously filmed on a budget, and using Water's stock cast, this is a movie simply about a contest to see who are the filthiest people alive. All the characters are bizarre in one way or another. This movie reminds me of Rocky Horror Picture Show in that everyone in the film has something odd about them and both movies joyfully celebrate these uniquenesses. Not a movie to buy for Mom on Mother's Day... but worth seeing just to say you did.

I hate people who only go to movies that make them feel good and never challenge them.  I admire directors who try to push people's buttons.  I bring this up because while watching Pink Flamingos (1972) my most profound feeling was one of extreme boredom.  Apparently a lot of people are convinced this movie is disgusting and shocking, which leads me to believe they've been living under rocks or the roof of a protective, loving family.  Throughout most of PF, the bad pacing and incredibly bad acting were enough to obscure whatever `shocking/disgusting' things might have been happening on screen. The acting in PF is by far the worst aspect of the film and no doubt greatly contributes to the shoddy pacing.  No one gives anything even approaching an amateurish performance.  The actors shout out their extremely bad lines with great force yet at the same time manage to sound as if they're reading from a cue card.  Either that or they seem so self-conscious that it impossible to ignore the fact that they're trying to act and are failing miserably. Take the four reporters at the end who show up to cover the trial of Raymond and Connie Marble.  They were not even for one minute convincing enough to portray fake reporters let alone real or even satirical reporters. So we sit through truly agonizing conversations, which makes scenes seem even longer than they really are, as we sit and endure and finally beg for the people in the film (I refuse to call them actors) to shut up. Eventually they do, but Waters mostly fills these pauses with long shots of something or other (often people walking), followed by brief spurts of `action' (in the kicking down of doors sense of the word) and confrontation, which inevitably lead to yet more excruciating discussions.  Basically, it takes far too much time and far too much talk to do anything in Pink Flamingos, which at 108 minutes would still be too long if cut to 60. There are perhaps 35 minutes of concise action and less than 10 minutes of salvageable dialogue that could be culled into a far better film. In truth, there was one aspect of the movie that offended me.  I refer, of course, to the scene in which Crackers has a three-way with Cookie and a chicken and in the process swings the chicken around by its neck.  It didn't bother me at all that he seemed to be raping Cookie, but I was incensed by the abuse suffered by that animal.  As if swinging it around and stuffing it between them wasn't bad enough, the actions taken by Danny Mills (the man playing Crackers) appeared to have killed that chicken.  I understand that animals are often used in movies and may come to be injured or even killed by accident, but when that injury seems to be the direct result of abuse by a cast member, I find that utterly unjustifiable.  In fact, I find it so reprehensible that that removed any possible impact the film may have held. I went through the rest of the film thinking `Crackers is a filthy asshole being played by a guy who is a cruel jerk.' Perhaps part of the problem is that I wasn't even born until 9 years after PF was released and didn't see it until a full thirty years after it's first screenings.  Whatever it is trying to satirize means nothing to me.  I can understand why it might have been offensive to audiences in the 70's (the swearing, the violence, the full frontal nudity) but most of it is old hat to me (okay, except for Divine eating dog feces at the end.  I will admit that I found that relatively gross).  South Park, Meet The Feebles, Dead Alive, all of these not only shocked me more, were more gruesome (the climax of Dead Alive used 300 liters of blood shooting out at 5 gallons a second - from a lawnmower), but are also far more clever than Pink Flamingos  "},{"Title":"A must-see----kind of","Date":"18 April 2006","Score":"11 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Horror","Review":" Babs Johnson (Divine) lives in a trailer with her son Crackers, her daughter Cotton and her mother Edie (Edie Massey).

Crackers has sex with a woman with a live chicken between them while his sister watches; the Marbles pick up female hitchhikers, impregnate them, keep them chained in the basement and sell the babies to lesbian couples; Divine and family have a party which includes cannibalism etc etc. It's disgusting but, in a way, not unwatchable. It's SO over the top and is so unapologetic about it that it's kind of fascinating. As director John Waters might say, it's bad taste done well. Also it's kind of amusing to watch--the acting is so wretched (especially by Massey) that you just watch it in disbelief. A friend laughed out loud at how bad Massey was (she improved in later pictures).This is NOT for people who are easily offended. Even though it's over 30 years old it's STILL shocking.

Have a guess at who'll win that one!?John Waters' early camp films are not for the average viewer. You must appreciate this man's form of art, but it definitely IS art! Later films like Hairspray, Cry Baby are geared at a main stream audience, for which the filmmaker had to tone it down considerably. For the College Camp Scene though, there is no substitute for the original 70's camp mastrpieces.For anyone who is a John Waters virgin and would like a recommendation for the next project, I suggest Female Trouble . There's so much more to John Waters' vision, realized through his muse Divine. The visually stunning, grotesquely overweight transvestite is quite credible as Dawn Davenport, the high schooler who burned her small-town bridges when she didn't get her cha-cha heels for Christmas in Female Trouble. There are many scenes that are definitely not for the squeamish, highlighted by the moment where Dawn gives birth (alone) and bites the ambilical cord (like primates would do), then, without losing a beat, gets up to confront the newborn's father via a pay phone.If Pink Flamingos entertained you without giving your stomach a turn-over, then you can handle anything delivered by the creative genius John Waters. As all directors, Waters has had a few duds, even if they were box office successes. Avoid the made-up-as-they-go Pecker, a total waste of time. The musically sparcling Cry Baby was trashed by critics, but the sound track makes up plenty for a lousy script. The one to beat is the 1988 Hairspray, Divine's swan song. Pink Flamingos is the ONE that started it all and put Waters on the cult-city map of the world! Just to be safe, have the movie first -- then the dinner!

It is beyond criticism or even explanation because it doesn't really aspire to be like any other movie you've seen. You will either get it, or you won't, laugh at it or roll your eyes in disgust (or both). John Waters is an odd filmmaker (putting that mildly), mixing both innocent, childlike humor with shockingly offensive moments intended to...well, who knows what his intentions were. It is like a form of assault, albeit a funny one.The thing that makes Waters's humor so infectious and effective is that his characters inhabit a world that can seem both alien and completely familiar to the viewer, like the petty rivalries that form the plot of Pink Flamingos. Surely everyone has experienced this kind of thing at some point, but almost certainly the matter at stake was not the title of The Filthiest Person Alive. What makes the movie compelling viewing for me is the way that Waters creates giddy, self-contained environments and doesn't let you in on the joke right away. The people in his films are completely in tune with one another. For instance, when Cotton tells Babs that she doesn't want to accompany her into town because Crackers is bringing his lady friend out to the trailer, Babs reacts with a knowing smirk and says to her, in a conspiratorial aside, That little shed's just PERFECT... At this point, we do not know yet that Crackers plans to take his lady friend out to the shed to thrust live chickens at her naked body while Cotton watches orgasmically through a window, but this weirdness is totally commonplace and understood by the characters in the fictitiously degenerate world that Waters creates.Another example would be the conversations between the girls in the basement and Channing, the Marbles' deviant butler. The first time we see them, Waters cuts jarringly from a scene in Connie's cozy office to Channing descending into the basement, where we see that there are two women down there, one dead and one very much alive and p***ed off. Susan is not a cowering victim, but is enraged and abusive to Channing, leaping up to launch a full-scale verbal attack on her jailer. They both have a weird understanding of the bizarre situation, and she is not so much intimidated by her kidnapping as she is violently insulted and righteously furious. She does not let up for one second while Channing is in her sight, and the two scenes that feature their delirious banter are two of the comic highlights of the film. Later in the film, when Divine and Crackers break into the Marbles's home and discover their crimes of keeping abducted women in their basement, it represents the total lack of support that Divine and her family have for the brand of depravity that the Marbles are pandering--here is something Divine is unfamiliar with, a corruption devised by her newfound rivals, and she despises it. Furthermore, while kidnapping does not seem like something Divine would think twice about, she is indignant that the girls are being held down there and happily sets them free, relishing the revenge that they take on Channing.At the other end of the filth spectrum, Waters occasionally reminds us of the line between his twisted fantasy world and the real world. The first time we see Connie, she is belittling a minor character named Sandy Sandstone, who has never heard of Divine. Cookie, on the other hand, reacts with a hilariously matter-of-fact evaluation of Divine's title as the filthiest person alive, revealing that she inhabits this world of unspoken and understood lunacy as well.Something also must be said for the way the players are in touch with their respective roles, especially Divine, who doesn't miss a note. Not once does he falter in the ridiculous garb and character he's been given, and it takes Pink Flamingos to a new level or weirdness. People actually believed Divine was like this in real life, and it's easy to understand why, because while watching the movie, you're not really thinking about the movie, you're thinking about these people who made it. Since they're really doing the outrageous things in the script, you start to think that maybe this is not a story but a bizarre documentary.But even more so, Pink Flamingos is not so much a movie as it is an event, or something that happens to you. Even though its shock value is mostly gone for me now (I say mostly because the a**hole scene and the chicken scene still make me wince), I still find this film to be hilarious and habit-forming.

Even today, this film includes some of the grossest sequences ever captured on screen, and one is often not sure whether one is about to puke out of disgust or laughter. Some disgusting highlights include Crackers having a date that includes sex acts with chickens, a man with a 'singing' anus, Divine performing oral sex on her film son, and Divine eating actual dog-crap (for real!). This truly isn't for the easily offended, and even I, an avid fan of controversial cinema, find it hard to look at at times. However, it is a positive disgust, as the gross stuff on screen is simultaneously insanely funny. I first saw the film several years ago, and, in spite of knowing about its reputation, I wasn't prepared for it to be such a magnificent exercise in epitomizing bad taste.

The one really funny bit (to me) was the second flashing incident where the girl flashed him back and the flasher fled in panic. I don't know why but that was just plain funny to me. The BJ scene was pretty good but was edited out during the theatrical run. Also, I'm trying to remember when Deep Throat came out. It seems like around that time people were trying to push the borders of what a legitimate theater might show (remember Fritz the Cat?). I'm glad they pushed, but even so, have we made progress in showing nudity in mainstream theaters? I don't think so. Even today, I don't think the DVD BJ scene could be shown in a legit theater.

More heartbreaking than a Shakespearian tragedy. More poetic than even the most melodramatic poems about lost love and blah blah blah. And on top of all that, the greatest trash ever made.A black comedy testing the limits of the human senses, John Waters's cult movie Pink Flamingos is a story about the conflict between two families that ends in humiliation, death and of course the eating of dog feces (yeah by the way that is not actually the humiliating part). No no, this is not about the impossible love, there are no Romeos or Juliets on these 90 or so minutes. This movie is about the battle for prestige if you could call it that. The battle for the title - Filthiest person alive.On one side we have Divine (played by the cross-dressing Waters regular... umm... Divine) a caring daughter, good mother, cannibal, murderer, pervert and current owner of said title. She loves her son Crackers a bit way too much. Crackers himself sports a sexual attraction to both chickens and young ladies sometimes mixing them up in threesomes. Family friend and loyal accomplice Cotton gets her satisfaction from watching Crackers during some of his... acts involving the mentioned earlier objects of attraction. Last but not least Divine's mother and grandmother to Crackers, Edie. A 400 hundred pound woman, sleeping, eating and basically living in a baby cradle. She is addicted to eggs and loves the egg-man (the man who brings the eggs...lol).The four of them live peacefully in a caravan outside the city until the moment when they become a target for the Marbles. Exhibitionists, manipulators, cheaters, very evil people actually. Their main source of income comes from the kidnapping and impregnating of young women. For the impregnating part they use their trusted and loyal cross-dressing butler to provide the semen. After that they sale the birthed child to the highest bidder.It was the Marbles's envy towards Divine and her title that will lead to an inevitable confrontation between the two families. An Epic battle of filth, perversion and violence.Pink Flamingos is an unsurpassed masterpiece in the trash-movie genre. Loaded with oddities and strange acts, John Waters's movie is loathed and hated by traditionalists, critics and the average movie-going audience. But for the few that remain unscratched by these generalizations the Flamingos is an unforgettable experience. Funny and sick, violent and poetic.

At last, I made up my mind, took all my courage and watched the impossibly obscene, terribly disgusting, outrageous to a limit, shocking to a nausea, but at the same time extremely funny criminal cult comedy. The film that was made on the shoe-string budget by the self-proclaimed king of bad and nasty taste, native Baltimorian, Mr. John Waters, in 1972, still has not become outdated and would shock you like no other. If you only imagine something disgusting, mean and dirty, rest assured - Waters uses it in the film, his debut feature, and has a lot of fun with it. He does not care a bit how shocking the characters on the screen are and what moronic things they do to each other but somehow, the film maintains light,playful, and comical feel about it. If someone had told me before I saw Pink Flamingos that the graphic scenes of exhibitionism and incest could be hysterically funny, I'd suggest they should seek a medical help but these scenes and many others ARE funny maybe because the first time writer/director and his friends performers did not take any of what was happening on screen seriously, did not try to make any sense, did not rebel or make a statement or try to prove something. All they wanted to do - to shock the viewers and to make them laugh. They achieved their goals. I would not urge everyone to seek out and to watch Pink Flamingos but its unique niche in cinema makes it one of its kind event. If you decide to watch it, do it on empty stomach - as much as I tried not to look at the screen during the infamous final scene, it is still hard to ...well, swallow.

Spain has Almodovar, but there was a time when he was daring to go that extra mile and rip the concept of what a movie should be to shreds, before he became a respected director and has gone to mainstream yet high quality films. England had Jarman. We still have John Waters, and thanks to him, we can enjoy the Hunh? kind of movie that PINK FLAMINGOS is.Give an extremely subversive, creative person enough freedom of expression and a camera and you will have a bona fide movie director. Way back in a time before the advent of YouTube and viral videos, you had those people who genuinely, despite their almost nonexistent academic knowledge of cinema per compounded many times over by this genius that, like the fire which burns Divine's trailer down, raged through their finished product, had something special -- something indescribable, indefinable -- that made them automatic cult figures and icons-to-be for an entire future generation.It didn't make them a threat to the movie industry and it doesn't now. Such people, like Luis Bunuel back in 1929 when he did UN CHIEN ANDALOU, live in their own Universe and It moves at its own pace. John Waters could hardly be called anything at all his movie, which premiered nearly 35 years ago, was greeted with dazed reaction. Some called it the best thing since CRIES AND WHISPERS. Some called it trash. Pure filth. People didn't really know what to make of it then, and even now, when purportedly we've come a long way, it stands on its own pedestal, defies explanation, defies a rating, and shrieks out its outrageousness by ways of the furious persona of Divine who does things that can only be summarized in one word gasp.What plot there is, well, here it goes Babs Johnson (Divine), also known to tabloids as the Filthiest Person Alive lives in a trailer outside Baltimore with her son/lover Cracker and her daughter Cotton. Another couple, the Marbles, have plans of becoming themselves the Filthiest People Alive. They run an illegal baby ring for lesbians via two kidnapped girls via the man servant who gets them pregnant. Once the Marbles burn Babs' trailer down, Babs vows revenge. Then she takes it just a little bit farther up the scale, and what happens later has to be seen to be believed.Does it aim to shock? Well, for those who like their movies classy and elegant, this one will probably kill their party. It features some of the most bizarre scenes ever filmed, and there is that one moment right at the end when Divine decides it would be rather fun to do something unspeakable with what comes out of a small dog's rear end. The music John Waters uses is so jarringly out of place that it makes the scene insane, and it will take a strong stomach and willpower not to scream (in equal parts laughter and disgust) at how there the movie goes.Now, here is the hard part can I recommend PINK FLAMINGOS? I would have to say yes, because it's become a part of outrageous cinema. Its documentary, home-movies style is a main part of its charm it makes a complete mess of a movie brilliant. Even when it touches certain themes best left for the Marquis de Sade (such as coprophagia, rape, incest, dismemberment, voyeurism, bestiality) it does so in such a balls-out hysterical way it's impossible to take it seriously. All anyone can do is watch in awe, and see the man who in later years became tamer and went mainstream with HAIRSPRAY, who once was as punk as Sid Vicious. This is as hardcore as hardcore gets for Waters. And that is a compliment.

But it's so different, so independently crafted, and so uniquely presented that a bad review is simply not possible. It's a transgressive art form that is not of good, but shockingly so bad it's good quality. I believe that John Waters is quite possibly the only filmmaker who could concoct something like Pink Flamingos seriously.The film is disgusting, revolting, appalling, maddening, deplorable, and of immature taste. But its script, events, and art form all are taken in such a unique and respectable manner that it is impossible not to commend it for being such an exploitive film. I can't remember the last time I've seen a bad film with such interesting characters, a flamboyant lead, and a satisfying script and story.Plotwise, the film centers around two separate families both in competition for the title of The Filthiest Person/Family Alive. The first family is made up of the current filthiest person named Divine who goes under the pseudonym Babs Johnson (Divine), her simpleton, egg-obsessed mother Edie (Massey), her son who has a chicken/sex fetish named Crackers (Mills) and his traveling sex-companion Cotton (Pearce). They reside in a mobile home in the middle of the woods with a pair of plastic pink flamingos out on their front lawn.The other family is made up of Connie (Stole) and Raymond Marble (Lochary). The couple run a black market baby sale to Lesbian couples by having their sex-servant named Channing (Wilroy) go out and kidnap random women and having them impregnated by him. They hold the women captive until they give birth to the kid, and upon selling it to the Lesbian couple, they donate the proceeds to heroin dealers at elementary schools and their own line of pornographic stores.There's your premise and you can imagine the barrage of laughs, screams, shrieks, and quivers you'll get out of that. It appears Waters had all of these sick, twisted, and deranged ideas but couldn't find a way to successfully incorporate all or enough into a feature length film. So he made the plot about two separate families being gratuitously filthy so that many or all of his ideas could be fully utilized. Genius.It should also be said that Pink Flamingos occupies one of the strangest scores in history. Many songs are played, mostly older tunes that are instantly recognizable. I doubt musicians like the great Little Richard and LaVern Baker ever thought their music would be incorporated in a shock film for the sick and depraved. It might actually be something to be proud of.Normally the case with shock films is once you discover or see the shocking element it wears thin and the film itself becomes a one note joke. Pink Flamingos doesn't just include one but various elements and scenes of shock that assure boredom prevention and the peak of your curiosity reached.Being shot on 16 and 35mm and being re-released twenty five years later, the film still occupies a strange and stylistic documentary look which only further intensifies some of the film's scenes because some, if not all, of them were actually real. Divine does an exceptionally well done job of playing one of the most provocative and shameful film protagonists ever seen, but the true tragedy is he died before experiencing any true, broad success.So what am I missing? Whether or not I recommend the film. I can't say. It's one of those films that you should already know if you want to see. I don't need to further you in your decision-making. Pink Flamingos is a trashy, stylistic masterpiece of the maximum proportion. To call it manipulative would be wrong since it still has a rather subtle popularity, and to call it awful would be completely wrong. It is completely worthy of the title the best worst film. NOTE I didn't give this film a star rating on purpose. It's because I can not effectively rate this film in any way. And giving it multiple ratings would be disingenuous. It exists in a world that doesn't have a single star shining.Starring Divine, David Lochary, Edith Massey, Mary Vivian Pearce, Mink Stole, Danny Mills, David Lochary, and Channing Wilroy.

Yet here, the humor just isn't there as it seems the intent is to shock the viewers and not entertain them in any way.

I tought Spice World was the worst movie ever, but John Waters now holds that title with this disgusting movie. I've read some reviews and comments and I really can't understand why some people actually consider this as a good movie or a cult film. OK so the plot of the movie is to earn the title as the filthiest person alive. For starters Divine is the filthiest most disgusting THING I've ever seen (I tried to say most disgusting person, unfortunately none of the characters on the movie qualify as human beings, they are the antithesis of what a relatively decent person is), Divine has the award with no problem at all. The movie is certainly not artistic in anyway, nor it states a point of view with it's filthyness (like for example the debate and point of view that A Clockwork Orange's intention is with it's unmeasured violence), on this crap the decadent characters and situations are not a criticism on human beings or on society's decadence and recent lack of humanity, morals and solidarity, it's just filthy, disgusting lacking of intelligence and rationality. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a conservative of any kind, it's just that a movie that involves chickens and sex, raping with injections and the poodle scene, can't be good for anyone. I actually think a few of my neurons walked out on me or committed suicide after I got them trough the suffering of watching this terrible assassination of good cinema. It's a shame that you can't place a 0 vote on this database, else that would've been my vote a huge, gigantic 0! As conclusion of this brief comment I have to say that basically the movie deserves two awards filthiest movie ever and worst movie ever, as for Mr. Waters (director) you beat Divene and the other disgusting people for the title, YOU are the most disgusting person alive just for imagining and getting to film this absolute insult to intelligence. For my reader, this is more than crap, an absolute 0 is it's qualification, please don't watch it and if you unfortunately do, after watching it follow my advice and grab a nice book, listen to some good music or watch a great movie, just to remind your brain that it was a mistake and that you're actually clever, reflexive and rational.... and that watching Pink Flamingos was just a mistake nothing else.

Let me start off by saying that everything you've heard about Pink Flamingos is true. It doesn't hold back; it's rated X for a reason and proud of it. Perhaps that's why, even though I don't like gross-out movies, this film calls to me; instead of being juvenile and sniggering, it's uncompromising and adult, with enough outrageous wit to keep it from sinking into brainlessness. Indeed, in pasteurized and homogenized American society, a film like Pink Flamingos deserves credit for even existing.Divine is the Filthiest Person Alive, living with her family in an unheated trailer in the woods of Maryland under the alias of Babs Johnson. John Waters has described Divine as a combination of Jayne Mansfield and Clarabelle the Clown, and never has the statement rung so true. With her cocktail dress, Spring-O-Lators, towering orange bouffant, and eye makeup swooping across her forehead, Divine certainly is a wonder to behold. In downtown Baltimore live red- and blue-haired (respectively) Connie and Raymond Marble (Mink Stole and David Lochary), who believe that they and not Divine are the Filthiest People Alive. And so the Battle of Filth is on, and bizarre depravities begin piling up.Pink Flamingos is a film unlike any other. An unrestrained attack on traditional American family values and keeping up with the Jonses, it's actually a subversive and thought-provoking experiment. Whereas the Divine clan joyously wallow in their filthiness, the Marbles are pretentious, preachy, hateful people who, ultimately, get just what they deserve. The movie is pretty well done, considering its underground origins, with good performances (Edith Massey stands out as retarded, egg-obsessed Mama Edie) and a weird home-movie-from-hell low-budget authenticity. (I, personally, think the punched-up picture and stereophonic sound of New Line's special edition do a bit of a disservice to this aspect, though I love the extra supplements at the end.)Make no mistake, this is the shock movie to end them all. I won't go into detail, but suffice it to say I was disturbed by the chicken sex scene and actually gagged at the gift, the party entertainment, and of course, the infamous finale. Two other scenes are literally pornographic, so if you're squeamish about that, beware. But for the adventurous meuviegoers out there looking for something funny, unforgettable, and strangely brilliant, Pink Flamingos is essential viewing. One of the ultimate cult classics, I honestly believe it is a motion picture everyone should see at least once.

This film is filth and kitsch and sex and America in one package of inspired and degenerate film. Divine's performance as the overblown and degenerately inspiring QUEEN OF FILTH is the trash!!!! Divine is the QUEEN!!! of trash and trash and smut, filth, degeneracy, and unconventional lewdness and elegant perversion. Divine here is larger than life, stunning, and inspiring in filthiness, particularly in the scenes where she is wearing her hair big and orange, her eye make-up stunning, and glamour in her clothes. Here she is the larger-than-life symbol of filth and beauty. Her glamorous-kitsch clothes are great, big colorful outfits, and DIviNe's makeup is decorative and bet in her mosautiful. The screen effect of Divine simply when sauntering down the street in most outrageous dresses, furs, hair, pants,and makeup to 50's rock and roll songs with a brash effects makes you swoon and energizes you with the divine power of DIvINe.Pink Flamingos is famous for its disgusting perversions and live sexual acts, violence, and bodily functions, which include Danny Mills having sex with chickens, DIvInE eating and recieving turds, castration, masturbation, artificial insemination, vomit,murder, cannibalism, oral sex, incest, torture, voyeurism, various other sexual fetishes and perversions, murder, live sex, defecation, using meat for intimate purposes, foot fetishes,violence as a cause for sexual arousement, bondage, and blood. That's about it, and very little of the perversion/sex/violence is clinical, except when you are with the Marbles. The basic plot of the film is that Divine is living with her mother (Edith Massey, with a hilarious obsession with eggs), her friend, traveling companion, faux- daughter, lesbian lover and apprentice Cotton (Mary Vivian Pearce, looking like Jean Harlow), and of course, Danny Mills as mentally certifiable son CraCkers. They trademark themselves as the filthiest people in America, but the Marbles and their poor hilarious butler Channing believe they have that title. The Marbles are angry, hollow, pretentious criminals with died hair, who operate a baby ring, and sell heroin. They battle with Divine for her title, but the true queen Divine wins in one of the great scenes of history, the Marbles live homicide in front of reporters. Divine proclaims that she is God, the Queen of Filth, blood turns her on and makes her cum, she is never wrong, and in a few words is GOD. John Water's directs this peice of filthy, degenerate, and hypocritical America with the grace of a sophistacated satirist and bordello madame. The film is about the filthy underbelly of American Culture, it's degenerate perversion, America's desperately glamourous and self-admiring, vain perversity, and ultimately, America's gross and desperate filth and corrupted and hypocritical, over-cradled and varied self-image. Edith Massey and her Eggman boyfriend are great, and I love Edith Massey as the egg obsessive. Connie and Raymond Marble, contesters for filth, are cruel and degenerate, hollow petty criminals who operate a cruel and horrible baby ring and employ the perverse butler Channing. They are not filthy, just criminals. The pure energy of Divine's birthday party and it's cannibalism are great. John Water's created a satire of America's perverse and bloated self-image and twisted glamorous aspirations and the perverse energies of America, it's gods of filth (Divine)and pure filth and kitsch energy itself. John Water's gross, filthy brilliance shines here like an American fresh cut lawn with Divine defecating on it. I have not yet mentioned her ingestion of dog turd, but it is a great and filthy closer to a film only a God of John Water's brilliance and degeneracy could make. The definitive image of the film  is the Godess of Filth, Divine, in full regalia in front of the American Flag. Divine is America, the American Flag is Divine. America needs a God, why didn't we crown Divine God when she/he was still alive?

In the immortal words of the Kids in The Hall God is dead sketch, MY mind has been blown. Everything, from the hair-colour(self applied,I hear) of the villians to the look of the interiors screams classic trash cinema. It's a roller-coaster ride of vile imagery and potty-humour that would make tom green live up to his name. The chicken scene alone..... This is not my favorite John Waters movie(thusfar that's either Hairspray or Desperate Living).

Therefore, Pink Flamingos didn't do much to my stomach except a little disgust when the one girl vomitted on the passed out girl which I wouldn't doubt was real puke.  But even that aside I knew that the movie was supposed to be completely revolting and shocking, and so I slipped it into my roommate's VCR, hoping she wouldn't come back and be disgusted by it too.  She didn't and I wasn't.  I sat on the edge of the sofa waiting for the one scene that would make me ill or want to flip it off, but it never came.  The anally-talented dancer, the semen injections, the shrimping scene with David's blue and Mink's orange pubic hair, even Divine's infamous feces snacking, brown teeth and all, didn't make me blink.  I guess I must be the sickest person out there if being offended by the movie is the standard.  I wasn't extremely shocked nor entertained.  It was a nice test of my limits which weren't really tested, but I chalk it up to another finished item on my college to-do list which also involved annoying the high school seniors doing a campus tour and showing up for class under the influence of something (which unfortunately was under the influence of the second-worst hangover of my life).

It helped him to cement his reputation as a prime purveyor of purely sleazy and grimy material. The pacing isn't the greatest - some scenes really go on too long - but Waters comes up with some truly awe inspiring nuttiness. The viewer won't believe what they're seeing.The great drag performer Divine plays a character named Divine, now assuming the identity of Babs Johnson and living in an isolated trailer in Maryland. Divines' trailer mates include a son, Crackers (Danny Mills), a travelling companion, Cotton (Mary Vivian Pearce), and an egg-loving mother, Edie (Edith Massey), who's confined to a playpen much of the time. Divine takes great pride in her status as the filthiest person alive, but the uptight Connie Marble (Mink Stole) covets that title and will do anything to get it.Also among the sordid characters are Connies' perverted husband Raymond (David Lochary), put upon butler Channing (Channing Wilroy), who's employed to knock up the hapless ladies kept in the Marbles' basement, Cookie the spy (Cookie Mueller), and Edies' beloved egg delivery man (Paul Swift). All of these quirky freaks provide solid entertainment value - Connie sports red hair and Raymond sports blue hair - but Divine dominates them all with a knowingly hammy performance and an incredible just go for it attitude.The various disgusting things that Waters has his people do really shouldn't be spoiled here, so that potential viewers can experience them fresh. The director fills the soundtrack with many catchy golden oldies and gives us a final scene that we're pretty much guaranteed to remember.Waters did earn this viewers' respect for having the courage of his convictions. He succeeds at creating a cult comedy that is equal parts jaw dropping, offensive, and funny in the most appreciably offbeat way possible.Seven out of 10.

I find that description to be exactly accurate. That's what this movie is all about, bad taste, dark comedy, and even social commentary. The movie portraits two families on which main members try to keep, respectively steal the tabloids title of filthiest person alive. The whole movie have a raw and odd feeling, helped out by main character, Divine. She is great in her role. Acting is kinda bad, but, it's the kind of movie that can get away with it. I would even say it fits the movie better than better acting would. The thing is that it's not bad in direct way, like characters would mess up their lines often, and look at the camera, it's bad as characters feel weird. And i thing that's the point. That weirdness that goes good with gruesome that this movie has to offer. The movie feels like a critique to big Hollywood movies and how those movies portrait middle income families. It feels like a mirror image to those families, taking the on-screen deformity backwards than Hollywood. Having in mind it's an 1972 production, the movie feels way ahead of its time. We now have similar things on TV and in society, to those that John Waters presented in his movie. People are eating all kinds of gross stuff on Fear Factor, an lesbian couple adopting a child is still taboo in many parts of the world, Jackass are doing all kind of crazy stuff for media. All these things were portrayed in Ping Flamingos, even if they were not common in that period, but the John Waters predicted them. Even the execution part, in front of the cameras. Public hangings were still a thing in late 19th century in some European countries. A nice dark comedy. Gross and nasty, but proves a point. Recommended to anyone.

The war between Connie & Raymond Marble against Divine for the title of The Filthiest Person Alive almost drove me mad, because i could count with my fingers the number of minutes when happened normal things in Pink Flamingos. I know that probably you think I am being too rude, mostly because Pink Flamingos it's a classic and a well known cult movie but I thought it was sick and nasty. But, even though I felt nauseated with the film, I had to admit that John Waters gave a touch of weirdness and style to the film. And even though I don't ever want to see it again, this poorly acted filthy movie will remain in cinema history as a cult classic. The scene when Divine eats dog feces was really difficult to watch but I believe that was the right way to end this nasty classic. I did not enjoyed it, no sir, but it was so shocking that I still feel that it is a must see for everyone who loves cinema.

Now that's an achievement.","Date":"21 June 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Horror","Review":" Pink Flamingos &#x96; The Movie is a rare bird which not only makes trash enjoyable but also a good film. Just a single clip of trashy reality TV shows Jerry Springer or The Maury Show on YouTube and what we witness is nonstop display of vulgarity, sleaze and uncontrollable behavior. On the other hand, we have a plethora of terrible films like The Room, the entire Friday the Thirteenth series, Caligula etc that are unintentionally hilarious but all in all unwatchable. Pink Flamingos is a sure shot delight for the voyeurs of violence, sex, deviance, coarseness and trash, albeit one that is made with uncanny expertise. John Walters is the small-scale Quentin Tarantino who can conjure unique, quirky characters and make them cult figures; we are not perturbed by the characters' wrongdoings and we usually end up rooting for them to commit another misdeed.The story here is narrated in an androgynous manner, probably by a flaming gay man or a transsexual, who takes us into the pink, tawdry and shabby trailer of Divine (who is living as Babs Johnson to evade police attention) and her family- her pretty, lusty blonde traveling companion Cotton who possesses the looks of a yesteryear's' star, her bucktoothed, long-maned chicken loving son Crackers and her egg obsessed cutie-pie mother Edie. Divine has long remained the undisputed 'filthiest person on the planet', unbeaten, unchallenged by anyone and is a small-time cult figure who makes it into shoddy newspapers. She is settled now, and does no harm to others other that warming beef between her legs to save on money. Her son seems more wayward at first, but only in sex (chickens are his favorite partners, it seems). Cotton exhibits only voyeuristic tendencies and likes to hang posters of beefy men next to her bed &#x96; but that seems acceptable. And sweet Edie only thinks and talks about eggs, their shape, size and color, Humpty Dumpty nursery rhyme, what happens if all the chickens disappear?, when will the egg-man arrive etc. No one seems to transgress modesty to an unlawful extent except perhaps Crackers. But all this changes when the team is challenged by Raymond and Bonnie Marble, a husband-wife team who vie to steal Divine's esteemed (at least according to them) title. Raymond exposes himself to unsuspecting souls but that is just the tip of the iceberg- the couple discreetly orders their homosexual manservant Channing to impregnate kidnapped women, so that the new-born can be sold to happy lesbian couples. The pitiful kidnapped woman in tattered clothes and straggly hair castigates Channing whenever he enters the basement; she hasn't even seen the actual perpetrators of her misery. When this terrible couple takes on Divine and her flamingos, it is WAR!I believe that the degree of crime committed by Connie and Raymond automatically makes them antagonists; while most of Divine's victims are simply killed without much introduction, we are constantly updated about Connie's victims' sufferings. Even the effect from the disturbing chicken scene with Crackers and the spy Cookie is palliated by the previous scene where we are told of Cookie's deception. . Divine and her gang shoot, chop and eat their victims in one scene but it is too hilariously over-the-top to be offensive. The sexuality on the other hand is something that is bound to gross out or p-ss off certain audiences, with the idea of incest itself can be unnerving for many, but again who really finds Divine to be role model or even a woman, with her androgynous appearance and her ludicrous make up (actual name Harris Glenn; yes, a man!).The entire setup seems like shots from a sleazy reality show, the budget of the film being so tight the entire product was the master copy. We see choppy editing, shadows creeping up often in the background, cameras shaking furiously while closing in on a person and passersby gawking at Divine's appearance as if completely unaware of the film. However, it is this low-quality which make the action look more authentic, as if Divine is an actual C-grade celeb who has made her name through malefaction. The songs, a mix of rock and roll and country make the scenes more lively and enjoyable, and also mitigate the actual violent acts that occur when the music is played.Watch Pink Flamingos if you want to see a kick-ass trashy exploitation film. It is hilarious at moments (the 'trial' scene) and deliciously (in a slightly gross way), wickedly and divinely entertaining.

An outrageous, blasphemous freak of nature which shocked disgusted, and oddly reflected the times. In 1971, John Waters would perfect his B-movie making skills with his colorful, flamboyant, mean-spirited epic that would ultimately ensure Divine as THE cult icon of the 70's, and push the boundaries of bad taste as far as they would go. This is your worst nightmare made into the greatest cult comedy of all time. This is Pink Flamingos, the undisputed filthiest piece of filth in the history of film.I bought this atrocity of a film years ago. Even as an obsessive fan of B-cinema, I was completely oblivious to it's reputation, I mean, I seriously had no idea what I was about to watch. I'll never forget those first words uttered,  It's 1030, Babs, Babs, why isn't the egg man here? At that moment, I hadn't the vaguest idea as to what was next. All I knew was that the possibilities were endless. There was no telling how the next hour and 40 minutes could have gone. I just stared in awe, with jaw firmly on floor, and witnessed an epic battle. A battle of filth vs. evil.Through the ages, certain questions have plagued humankind. Questions like, where do we come from? What the hell's the deal with the Bermuda Triangle? And, Who's filthier, Divine and her entourage, or Connie and Raymond Marble? Actually, no one has ever asked that. Everyone already knows the answer.A random, and might I add, a rather unrealistic story, where a lot of things go shamelessly unexplained. Things such as, why would the Marbles assume they are filthier than Divine just because they kidnap girls and have them impregnated by the butler and sell the babies to lesbians? That's not that filthy... it's just plain mean.Of course, there's much more to it than that. Soon, the Marbles set they're sights on Divine and her entourage. Once they get under Divine's skin, we are forced to sit through castrations, public exposure, incest, cannibalism, shrimping, unhealthy obsessions, bestiality. The list goes on, and on... and on.Not exactly an organized contest, mind you, but rather a not so well-thought-out, yet devious plot by 2 jealous perverts, to dethrone a Queen. This time, Waters holds nothing back, and Divine is the very definition of outlandish. There is truly something to offend even the crudest of individuals. I love this movie.Once or twice every decade, a B-movie director comes along and creates something either so bad, so hilarious, or in this case, so disgusting, that it transcends B-entertainment all together. Pink Flamingos is just not what you would expect. An understatement? Of course, but true, nonetheless. A look into the mind of a demented man-child with a rebellious streak, a sick, yet unique sense of humor, and some seriously odd friends. Pink Flamingos is more than just the Waters masterpiece. Pink Flamingos is John Waters, which is kind of an intimidating thought. I don't care if you thought Combat Shock was funny, or that Peter Jackson's Dead-Alive could've used more blood. If you haven't seen Pink Flamingos... then, you just haven't seen Pink Flamingos. Nothing could have prepared you for this one. Some years later, John Waters would write a script for a sequel, entitled Flamingos Forever. A movie which was to be distributed by Troma, and would see the return of Divine, Cotton, Crackers, and Miss Edie. The unfortunate death of Edith Massey, among other problems, would forever prevent this dream come true from happening. In 1971, Waters was king and trash was in, but in a perfect world, Flamingos would have definitely lasted forever. 10/10 "}{"Title":"I am your eggman","Date":"19 November 2009","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Horror","Review":" Baltimore's errant son, John Waters, has a CV that reads like a record-sheet of bad taste.

John Waters called his movie tacky and an exercise in bad taste, but it's just a collection of scenes that are unpleasant to watch, which sadly isn't an achievement on its own.Maybe it was something of an experience to see this in a real cinema (I can't imagine too many venues running it, though) when it came out, but the movie, like the performers in it, it hasn't aged too well.

While it certainly isn't as disgusting as it's made out to be, it does stand up well today, having been the innovator for all the toilet humor comedies that are so popular today.Divine is named the Filthiest Person Alive and has taken into hiding under the alias Babs Johnson when she is wanted by the FBI. She shares a trailer with her traveling companion Cotton (Mary Vivian Pearce), her mother the Egg Lady (Edith Massey), and her son Crackers (Danny Mills). Divine has, unknowingly, recently acquired some competition in the Marbles, Connie (Mink Stole) and Raymond (David Lochary). From here on, it's disgusting act after another, from flashing transsexual genitals to Divine going down on her own son (for real!), ending in the most famous ending in a film of all time, beating even CITIZEN KANE!John Waters needed a film that would gain attention and get him recognized. Well, PINK FLAMINGOS certainly does it. The performances in this film are all excellent. Another great actress is Cookie Mueller as Cookie the spy, who has to engage in chicken sex (or sex with a chicken's stump) with Crackers! Mama Edie lounges around in her underwear in a baby crib and runs off with the Egg Man! Divine actually gives a semi-hardcore blowjob to Crackers! The Marbles give each other toejobs! A cop raid is massacred! The Marbles are convicted of assholism! Oh, I can't recommend this movie more than enough. It can't really be called a movie, but it is certainly an original and can never be topped in outrageous humor.

Its gargantuan cult reputation is very well deserved, because, simply put, their is nothing else like it, not even in the rest of John Waters' oeuvre. Such a strangely entertaining and cartoonish film has never been made before or since. Waters seemed to somehow pull together the perfect cast for all of his persistently odd roles, a cadre of characters all willing to indulge in sexual perversities, tastelessness, bestiality, and the consumption of various human waste products. The low-grade film stock, the strange long takes punctuated only by zoom-ins, the weird overacting by everyone in the cast, and the disturbing montages set to classic oldies music all works together to become an entirely new film experience. I can't say that it's one that I fully understand, or even that I would like to see another film like it, but I can't deny that this film is truly delightful. Every scene pulsates with anarchical glee, the costume and makeup exudes cartoonish brilliance in every shot, and of course their is the unforgettably divine Divine, otherwise known as Glenn Milstead. His (her?) sheer energy and magnetism in every scene elevates the film immeasurably; no wonder he was Waters' muse. Replete with obvious line flubs, clear awkwardness during certain scenes, and shots which should probably have had a few seconds trimmed, this is certainly a trash masterpiece, the diametric opposite of high art, and Waters' crowning achievement as a filmmaker. Were this to be made by any filmmaker other than the supremely strange Waters, it most likely would have fallen flat on its face. No other auteur has ever been in the motion picture business who so well understands the value of utter garbage, and so revels in all that is dirty and depraved in the world. This film demands that the audience bask in the glory of trash as entertainment, and that we live, breath, and worship refuse. While I cannot say that I agree, or that I will partake in these activities anytime soon, it somehow manages to make it enticing. Pink Flamingos is the crowning achievement of waste throughout all of mankind's existence. The only reason that it gets a 9 and not a 10 from me is that there were several instances where the depravity did begin to sicken me rather than entice, though these were rectified shortly afterwards. Also, I think that if I gave it a 10 I might go to hell.

Than why is it a masterpiece? The answer is simply because John Waters intended it to be all those things and more. Even though Pink Flamingos isn't my personal favorite from the director, it's possibly the apex of his early years. Waters set out to make the ultimate experience in bad taste, and if a film's success is judged by how well it achieves what the makers had in mind, than Pink Flamingos is some kind of twisted masterpiece.The reason however why the film works so well is that it isn't the simple shock value many of the detractors have made it out to be. Waters is a subversive filmmaker, and Pink Flamingos just drips with well-placed satire. Not only does he damn the 50s perfect family ethos, he also gives a huge middle finger to the failing idealism of the 60s peace and love generation. It's difficult to imagine a film more against peace and love than this one.Waters' early stock cast of performers is present here, and they offer interesting performances to say the least. None of them are particularly good, but their technical incompetence perfectly complements the shoddy nature of the film. If anything, this was the film which catapulted Divine into cult legend status. Pink Flamingos is the most famous underground film ever made, and with good reason. It's probably the most wonderfully entertaining one, provided you have a very strong stomach.

It is when the viewer sees Divine's family for the first time inside their Maryland trailer park. Divine's mother permanently inhabits a crib, for she is mentally challenged (a challenge, I must point out, she doesn't even try to overcome), and she is obsessed with eggs. Yes, with eggs. All she talks about, in a childish whine, is eggs. The only thing she looks forward to in the egg man's arrival, so she can smear more eggs into her ample breast and voracious mouth. When she whines for more eggs her daughter (Divine) coos at her and promises that she will get those eggs, if she just waits. This grotesque reversal of the parent-child roles sets the mood for the film to come.This is a story about Divine, who goes by the name of Babs Johnson, and who bears the honorific The Filthest Person Alive. This is also the story of Connie and Raymond Marble--who kidnap hippies, impregnate them, and sell the babies to lesbian couples--who are deeply offended that they do not bear the honorific that they believe is rightfully theirs. So they start a war with the Johnson family to determine who indeed is The Filthiest Person Alive.I need not list the perversion that glut this movie. There are many, and if you want to see this movie, you have already heard of a few of them, I'm sure. They are filthy indeed, but that filth only goes skin deep. What is truly filthy about this film is its attitude. Divine's family is the poster family for Trailer Trash they are stupid, messy, perverted, and proud to be so. Then there's the Marbles they are actually offended because they don't bear the title of The Filthiest Person Alive. Let me raise a question here What kind of people actually want such a title? Let me raise the answer Filthy people.The acting is atrocious, and the voice-over narration is terrible. In some strange, aberrant fashion, it only adds to the movie and the filthiness it's trying to portray.

She has retreated from the limelight to a caravan where she lives with her pal Cotton, her son and her mother. Divine's mum spends most of her time in a playpen and is obsessed with eggs.But the title of 'filthiest person alive' is contested by arch-rivals, the Marbles. The Marbles kidnap hapless females and lock them in the basement to be impregnated by their servant. When babies are born, the Marbles sell them to lesbian mothers. Other sidelines include pornography and selling heroin to young school children. And the Marbles are miserable, nasty people.At the end of the film, and after the triumph of good filth over bad, a final scene 'proves' that Divine is not only the 'filthiest person alive' but 'the filthiest actress alive'. It is this scene that has caused most outrage. It involves Divine ingesting something a poodle has had the day before and just got rid of. The scene is still subject to censorship many years later in the UK. John Waters quips about it in 'This Filthy World', pointing out that he doesn't believe people are going to be so corrupted by watching it that they are likely to copy it.This, of course, raises all sorts of questions about his stated objective to shock and to entertain. There is no suggestion that makes the characters realistic. They are entertainment. So what are the limits of entertainment? Are any minorities offended? No. The idea that it could corrupt or deprave is easily dismissed. And it is uproariously funny and entertaining. People who find it offensive might consider asking themselves again why that is so. There are many more truly offensive films - films that do all the terrible things just mentioned.

First off, let me get this out of the way, I did enjoy this, moreover, I thought it was genuinely funny in parts. However, it is still a filthy, disgusting, disturbing and immoral picture.To summarise the odd story Divine/Babs Johnson is known as the filthiest person alive. She lives with her mum (who has an egg fetish and adores The Egg Man), her retarded son Cracker and daughter Cotton in a trailer. Quizzically enough, there is actually a family who are jealous of Divine's title. The Marble family are envious of Divine and try to outdo them in the category of filthy. Their method&#133;kidnap women, have their cross-dressing butler rape them, sell the babies to lesbians and then use that money to sell drugs to elementary school children. How's that for a plot?! Just to tick off a few of the many delights to be found within this movie incest, egg fetishes, cannibalism, rape, sh*t eating, chicken sex and copious male and female full frontal nudity. Well, if you are open minded, or have an odd and sick sense of humour you will love it! Pink Flamingos is a non-stop parade of foul scatological and sexual humour. If you do not enjoy that, you may enjoy the pure randomness of some scenes, for instance, a wedding in a wheelbarrow and the most repulsive party scene you will ever see. Notice the amount of synonyms used for disgusting? Admittedly, some parts were hard to watch and very wrong (and would personally never want to see again) but there were still many scenes that honestly just had me in fits of laughter. I do not expect this to be for everyone, but for those that like controversial and extreme underground flicks, this is right up your alley.Don't expect any good acting or a great quality plot and camera-work. This is not Oscar-material, this was not meant to be a social satire or thought provoking. It was made to gross out everyone it could.

But, overall, the film goes where few others have and I guess it's laudable for that. I thought that certain scenes dragged and some started to grate on my nerves. Also, the crazy antics were too few and far between.

John Waters was just a college kid with a camera and a bunch of the weirdest friends ever.

One family is made up of Divine, her severely demented son, her crib-ridden mother, and a sort of adopted teenage runaway. They hold the title from the very start, and the people who attempt to steal the title are a sicko husband and wife team named the Marble family who spend their days kidnapping young women and force their gay butler to impregnate them with a syringe and then sell the babies to lesbian couples, spying on Divine's family, and indecently exposing themselves to women in the park. Eventually the Marble family start a battle of sorts with Divine's family. Chaos ensues.With infinite respect to John Waters and his intentions with Pink Flamingos, this is easily one of the worst films of all time. However, it is intentionally so. So right from the start, points go to Waters for accomplishing what he set out to do. Whether or not this film is actually worth seeing is an entirely different matter altogether, but if there's one thing that I know for sure after watching Pink Flamingos it is that John Waters should be hailed as the poster child for rebellion through film. Film was John Waters' way of rebelling, and I think that if Pink Flamingos should be seen for any reason it is because it was the first of it's kind and the first film to go all the way in it's depiction of modern living. If anything, Waters should also be recognized for his vision of the kind of criminal behavior that has been worshiped and despised in equal measure. What I enjoyed most about the vision here is how self-contained it is. The film creates such a space and such a world that allows it to show you things that you have never seen before. There's animal abuse, graphic drug use, graphic slaughter and murder, coprophagia, rape, incest, torture, sexual fetishes on parade, dancing rectums, cannibalism, sadism, dismemberment, surrealism, castration, and a blow-job scene that manages to be more explicit than any of the scenes in Deep Throat and is even less sexually appealing at the same time!!! I think that the people who should watch this film are the people who think that Charlie Manson is a cool person. I know that it probably wasn't John Waters intention to make a film that was anti-hippie, nor was it his intention to make a film that was a rant against any sort of faction, nor was it intended to be political. However, so much time has passed since Pink Flamingos was released, and so much has happened since then. The film may have been made post-Altamont, but one can't help watching this film and feeling the same way about these characters as they do about the filmmakers. Why was a film made like this in the first place? The better question is, why was it made when it was made? There is no better time for a film like this to exist than today, and yet if it were made today it would likely not make it to video and DVD. I mean, look at Crispin Glover's directorial debut. What Is It? is a Herzog-inspired art film directed by Crispin Glover and the poster features a nude Shirley Temple standing in from on a giant swastika holding a riding crop. How on earth can a film like that be marketed in a mainstream fashion? The answer is that it cannot. S&M, Nazi-related imagery, and nude children are three things that make most Americans extremely uncomfortable. Pink Flamingos has the distinction being made during one of the most angry and most dark times in film-making history, the 1970s. The film was rated X upon it's original release and it still is not at all for children, nor will it ever be. Pink Flamingos is a pornographic, shocking, strange, and at times very funny film that not only plays with the head of the audience in how often it goes into total unpredictable territory, but also crams in as many taboos as a film could likely ever contain. It is easily one of the grossest, if not THE grossest, films I have ever seen, and it's power remains undiminished. I know it is considered blasphemous when I say that I prefer the films of John Waters post-Hairspray more than his 70s shock films, but his early films are not without merit. Pink Flamingos perfectly defines his early themes, and while his later films mostly deal with the dynamics of fame, family, and independent film-making. John Waters should be very happy that he has the power to gross out four decades of moviegoers, and that is where the power of this film lies.

No reason for this scene, except to make sure he gets you and also to make sure you leave talking about it. Obviously filmed on a budget, and using Water's stock cast, this is a movie simply about a contest to see who are the filthiest people alive. All the characters are bizarre in one way or another. This movie reminds me of Rocky Horror Picture Show in that everyone in the film has something odd about them and both movies joyfully celebrate these uniquenesses.

He can repeat the same story over and over and it never gets boring. He can hold your interest in any one of his DVD commentaries and growing up as a gay man in Baltimore, has a very interesting life. He also wrote some of the all time funniest films. There are three sections of his life that you have to take note of. There was some black and white shorts and feature length films in the 60's but I will leave those out of this review. The first section of his life was his early, angry, gross out work which went on from 1972 to 1977 (Pink Flamingos, Female Trouble, Desperate Living), 1981 to 1990 was the transition period where his work changed (Polyester, Hairspray, Cry Baby) and then there's the more mature big budget Hollywood films from 1994 to 2001 (Serial Mom, Pecker, Cecil B. Demented). These films are all uniquely different and hold different styles of their own and all are important pieces of filmmaking but no matter what, 'Pink Flamingos' will be John's most famous work (with the possible exception of 'Hairspray'). Even Waters has said that if he came up with a cure for cancer and died the next day, 'Pink Flamingos' would still be his biggest achievment. Made in 1972 for a small budget (People say different things so I'm not going to put an exact budget on it), it starred the infamous drag queen Divine who performed the infamous final scene (But unlike other reviewers, I'm not going to say what it is) along with Dreamlanders Mink Stole, David Lochary and Mary Vivian Pearce. I'm going to run along the story even although you will most likely know it already. Divine is the filthiest person alive but the FBI is hot on her tail so she hides out in a trailer near the woods under the alias Babs Johnson. She lives with her egg obsessed son Crackers (Danny Mills), retarded mother Edie (Edith Massey) and her travelling companion Cotton (Mary Vivian Pearce). Many papers call her the filthiest person alive but evil couple Raymond (David Lochary) and Connie (Mink Stole) Marble want that title will not stop at anything to hold that title for themselves. I could easily just talk about everything that goes on in the film as many reviewers have chosen to do but I feel this is a very original film which is actually a satire on modern family life. The Divine clan are trailer trash. They have incestuous relationships and do very sick things but the Marbles are the exact view of suburban life. Clean houses, well organized and in the end they turn out to be the failures. They consider themselves filthy yet are disgusted at Divine's accomplishments proving that Divine and trailer trash win out and that modern day families are basically just clones of each other. The film improves with repeat viewings as you see just how sharp the wit on display is. John Waters' script is filled with some of the most quoted lines in film history. Although nobody is really a trained actor, their performances far surpass any modern day oscar winner. Divine is, as always, perfectly cast in his role and has some of the best lines on display. Edith Massey presents her very unique style of acting and, believe me, she's a real talent. Mary Vivian Pearce (The only person to appear in EVERY John Waters film) once again provides some laughs even if she doesn't always get the big roles she deserves. Mink Stole and David Lochary are hilarious as the perverted couple who want to steal Divine's title to no avail but it is truly Danny Mills who stands out. John Waters discovers a new male talent in each of his films starting from here going right up to 'Cecil B. Demented', all of whom rarely appear in any other John Waters movie (In fact, I don't think any of them ever have). Danny is very real in this film which makes his gross out scenes stand out but, unlike a lot of other people, I did not once cringe at this movie. I found it's situations funny but I was more impressed with the sparkling satire on display. Divine's infamous last scene is much less shocking than an oral sex scene earlier in the film. Not to take away from his brilliant performance though. Although his later films are even better, Waters first color film is a brilliant black comedy worthy of repeat viewings. Two things though, I want to see more! Waters has said there is about an hour of deleted scenes but only 15 minutes were on the DVD and were only small snippets of deleted scenes (The Marble's earlier attack on Divine's trailer had much more to it than we see in the deleted scenes section). Mind you, Waters said he found the footage in his attic so maybe all the other stuff is lost or too old and ruined to be seen today. Also, there was a sequel planned for this film. The script is widely available but will never be seen due to the deaths of main actors. It's a shame, the script seems even better than the first 'Pink Flamingos'. I would also like to see what Danny Mills is doing these days. Overall, I love this film and couldn't say more about how much I love it. Well written and directed, it's brilliantly staged and is one of the best comedies of the later half of the century. Much better than any gross out movies today, it is pure genius of the highest order. A must see for any self respecting film viewer.

Accompanied by her mother, a mentally obese woman who has a fetish for eggs and her son a sexual deviant who has a fetish for chicken they willfully take the most disgusting morally wrong actions one could ponder and act them out for amusement.

Raymond and Connie Marble form a plot to un thrown Divine from her natural gift of the filthiest person alive.

Soon after they find and kill the Marbles which leads to the closure of the film. If there was ever a not a need for mise en cinema it would have to be for Pink Flamingos.  The actors and actresses not only wore outrageous outfits, but performed acts in front of a camera which let one laughing then turning away in repulsion.

In one such scene Mr. Marble a habitual flasher comes a cross a women who flashes herself back at him only to find it was a man. Beyond the sick sights which leaves no one to discredit the characters' filth the small town and rural shots of the country side make the film believable that somewhere in a place like that the same acts could be occurring, as sick as the thoughts may be. The film's utter of knowing the line between humor and repulsion intrigues viewers to stay and ask what else could happen, yet leaves some to say I am going to vomit.  It is not a film for the weak of stomach or mind.

When discussing the films of Waters, especially his earlier work, shock value and disgust are two words that often come up.  Waters himself has stated that the reason these films exist is to shock people.  What needs to be addressed when discussing these films is the intent, which is to shock and make viewers uncomfortable. Why attack Waters than for the films he makes.  The history of film is strewn with examples of films that are made to extract a reaction from viewers, be it a positive or negative reaction.  Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali's film Un Chien Andalou (1928) is simply a series of disturbing images the filmmakers put together from their dreams.  This film was made according to the principles of surrealism and has no discernible plot, which the filmmakers intended, and is considered a classic of early cinema.  How a film interacts with its audience is the goal of filmmakers like Waters and Bunuel, and in Waters case he has met his goal.  While many have deemed Pink Flamingos tasteless and sick these views do not negate the impact the film has had.  There are hundreds of films that are sick and tasteless that have fallen by the wayside.

Just looking at what the story is about will give anyone that idea.  The film is about two competing families that both want to be considered the filthiest people alive.  With a story line that is based around this you should expect to see some very disgusting things, which you do. The film starts out with looking at the mother of Divine, who is an old woman who does everything in a playpen, and appears to be mentally retarded throughout the course of the film.  All she does is eat eggs, and that is all she wants to do all the time is eat eggs.  She is wearing a very tight outfit that looks absolutely horrible on her, and her daughter, Divine, acts to her like she is the daughter.  I believe that this part of the film is designed to be an opener to let the audience know that this film is not one for the week of heart or stomach. After a while you meet this other family known as the Masons.  At first they appear to be a normal Christian family that wants to hurt Divine because her and her family are so disgusting.  However, after awhile you begin to notice that the Masons are just as disgusting as Divine. They keep girls locked in the basement and has their butler rape them so they can have babies, and then the Masons sell the bodies to other families.  They are also very into foot fetishes when you see them in their bedroom naked.  A very interesting thing I noticed was that the Masons both have their hairs dyed different colors.  Misses Mason has her hair red, while Mr. Mason has his hair green.  This I gather gives some insight into the type of people they are, because they not only dye their hair on top, but also on bottom. Another reason that the Masons are just as sick as Divine is because they sent her excrement in the mail to show how filthy they are.Divine and her family are disgusting because her son has sex with a girl, and wants to use a chicken in the sexual act; while a fellow companion woman watches and enjoys it.  They also have a party in which very disgusting things go on; one of which was a man opening and closing his anal hole, which was absolutely disgusting.  Later Divine and her son go to the Masons and spread their filth around their house, and eventually end up in a form of incest involving oral sex. A twist to the story that is actually funny instead of gross was when the Masons returned home after Divine and her son spread their filth around, the furniture in the house rejected the Masons because the filth was no longer theirs.  Mrs. Mason and Mr. Mason both got thrown off of their furniture by their furniture.  A lot of other things happen including a trial and murder, but these parts are nothing compared to everything that you have to see in this film when it comes to disgusting. To give you a final idea on what this film was like, the ending scene will give anyone the impression that they should not see this film.  Divine eats a dogs excrement.  Nasty isn't it. Now when you look at the actually filming of the film it is filmed on very poor film, probably because it was in the seventies, and this made the film way more disgusting because the colors were all faded and did not make it look appealing.  Also this film had narration, but it was done by someone with a not so appealing voice, and made the film seem like it was meant for poor white trash.  I would not recommend this film to anyone unless they were absolutely psycho, or I just didn't like the person.  "},{"Title":"Warning!!! Possible Spoilers.

Pink Flamingos follows queen of sleaze Divine who lives in a trailer with her crazy son Crackers and obese, egg-obsessed mother Edie who are trying to rest quietly on their success of being 'the filthiest people alive'.  But competition is brewing in the form of Connie and Raymond Marble, who sell heroin to schoolchildren and kidnap and impregnate female hitchhikers, auctioning off their babies to lesbian couples after they die giving birth.  The couple, outraged by Divine's status of the Filthiest Person in the World, embarks on a mission to humiliate Divine and steal the crown from the notorious master of filth and all things wrong.  What unfolds is a total gross out film driven by Water's aspiration to create one of the most disturbing collections of images ever pieced together in an editing room. Pink Flamingos strikes sentiment with that part of our psyches in which we desire to test our own limits, proving that we can stomach anything we are confronted with visually.  The film, made on a budget the size of a flea uses shock as a way to attract audiences.  Before the end of Pink Flamingos (assuming movie goers stay for the duration of the film), viewers will be subjected to almost everything our culture regards as disgusting and just plain wrong.  This includes, but is not limited to incest, rape, cannibalism, castration, murder, bondage and even a scene where a dog defecates on a city sidewalk and Divine willingly consumes the waste in front of the camera. Well I managed to stay for the duration of the film and was treated to the extras the director threw in for the 25th anniversary edition of Pink Flamingos. After the hilarious outtakes which provide some sort of extra insight, the original trailer for the film is shown.  Surprisingly not a single scene from the movie is shown. Rather, the trailer features interviews with people who have just seen the film and are a little bewildered by the experience.  Most of these people actually enjoyed the film and some were even repeat viewers, suggesting that maybe mankind can be a little more demented than we normally present ourselves. At the end of the theatrical trailer a comment flashes on the screen comparing Pink Flamingos to The Andalusian Dog.  I have seen both films, and I would have to say that Waters' Pink Flamingos takes the cake for the most disgusting yet entertaining document of the phenomena that give us that distinct feeling of queasiness in our stomachs.

Divine's brain damaged mom gravelly sits in a crib seemingly only in a bra and panties, munching on hard-boiled eggs all day long.  One very disturbing scene is when her son has sex with chickens before killing and eating them and that's not everything.One charming thing with Pink Falmingos that deserves it's credit is the low budget that they had to work with.  The directors ability to make this film with little money and not having to pay his actors is quite interesting. This movie is a success is someway because to be able to make a movie like this even though it didn't get very far is remarkable.  Pink Flamingos doesn't really have a strong plot and isn't serious in any way but it's ability to get numerous responses from it's audience is creditable.  I don't think one person will ever have the same comments about this movie.  It's worth seeing it at least once to get a feeling of a very unique, and different combination of movie style.

Her enemies, the Marbles, live in a house (which looked remarkably like one used in Hairspray). Both of these groups do the grossest things ever seen in a movie. I won't comment on much of what they do, but I will say that there are a few parts that could have been left out. Such as when the marbles are in bed and share a weird foot fetish, or when Raymond Marble exposes himself to other women, or the rarely mentioned on the internet incident at Babs' party where a man goes up in front of everyone and begins do do things with his butt.

While most people prefer Female Trouble, this isthe only John Waters movie to really feature everyone(IncludingDanny Mills) in rather big parts.  Divine is a unwed, single mother who lives in a caravan with herson, mother and girlfriend. Oh, by the way, her son has sex withchickens, her mother has an egg obsession and Divine herselfshoplifts steaks between her legs. Divine believes herself to bethe filthiest person alive but two jealous perverts in Baltimore thinknot.  I think that this film really deserved all the publicity it got. The grossscenes are obviously a big part of the film(None of it grossed orshocked me though) but it is the dialogue that takes over the film. Ithas some of the most outrageous and funniest dialogue in anyfilm in the last few decades. John Waters may have been onmarijuana writing this but it helped the film.  The true highlight, though, is Danny Mills who plays Crackers,Divine's son, with extra creepy realism. I really wish he had donemore movies but, as most fans know, he does not want much todo with the film anymore which is kind of weird since he's in thetwo most shocking scenes The Chicken sex scene(Where he andCookie Meuller have sex with real live chickens) and the blowjob(Where his on-screen mother(Played by a man in drag giveshim semi-hardcore oral sex) and i don't see the point why he didthose scenes if he didn't want anything to do with it. Anyway, the rest of the cast has their moments too. Divine playsthe filthiest person alive in the film who is also called Divine(Thisled to a lot of people to believe back when it came out that this washow they really lived their life). Divine is of course the drag queenwho was John Water's trademark actor/actress until his tragicdeath(But John Waters recovered well, his later films aren't bad).Edith Massey plays The Egg Lady who is Divine's mother in thefilm and is obsessed with egss. This led to some very goodscenes including the scene where Edith and The Egg Mandecide to get married. Also starring are Cookie Meuller, Mary VivianPearce, Mink Stole, Channing Wilroy and David Lochary who all doa tremendous job on this. In the end, this film was made on the miniscule budjet of $10,000and is very rough but this only adds to the charm of the film.Believe me, you either love this film or hate it but give it a viewinganyway. 8/10 P.S. If you liked this film, then try John Waters' other moviesFemale Trouble, Desperate Living and Polyester to name but afew.

Not till you've seen this!  John Waters has been directing movies since the late 1960s.  But he's never tried to outdo this. Perhaps it cannot be done.Following the introduction of the film rating system around 1970, Hollywood began making movies of unprecedented realism -- graphic violence, gore, nudity, sex, and language that were not allowed in movies before. However, most of the cutting-edge movies made during the early 1970s seem relatively tame by today's standards; it's all been done so many times now.Not so with Pink Flamingos.  Thirty years after its initial release, it retains nearly all of its original shock value.  Even today's jaded audiences need a strong stomach to make it through this one.  It set the definitive standard for twisted, over-the-top, perverted, gross-out film-making. And over the years, Waters has gotten into serious trouble more than once for it.  Many call it worse than hard-core pornography.  No wonder Waters issued Pink Flamingos barf bags to the audiences.I won't go into the story line.  Suffice it to say that the basic premise of the movie is so preposterous that you cannot take it seriously.  Do not attempt to find any deep messages or social commentary here.

The scene where she receives a turd through the mail is one of the funniest things I've ever seen, and her long ranting rage of indignation (said without a breath) is incredible- totally berserk.  This scene contains my nomination for the funniest line in any film ever- 'Oh my god almighty, someone has sent me a bowel movement'- you need to hear it yourself, the written word does no justice to the Baltimore bombshell's accent. I would recommend this to anyone who appreciates the bizarre, the extreme fashions on display in this and Female Trouble have never been beaten, and the vile acts committed throughout the movie are the product of a seriously warped mind- I loved every minute of it.  There is a new DVD release of it that has been re-mastered and re-edited to include the full length dog mess eating scene, in gorgeous digital closeup- if this doesn't make you gag, nothing will.  The insemination scene has also been included in its full, overly offensive version. May Divine rest in piece, we won't see his like again, he's sorely missed.

That was it's point. John Waters(My hero) wanted to make a film that would shock audiences and make him a famous director. Considering he's now directing films with, Ricki Lake, Christina Ricci, Ed Furlong, Melanie Griffith and Kathleen Turner, i think he did get recognized. Just about every review here tells the plot but i'm going to repeat it. Divine(Glenn Milstead) lives in a caravan with her retarded mother Edie(Edith Massey), chicken-loving son Crackers(Danny Mills) and travelling companion Cotton(Mary Vivian Pearce). Divine is known as the filthiest person alive and she wants to keep that title. She lives a quiet happy life where she sticks meat between her legs and feeds her egg-obsessed mother all kinds of eggs but her quiet life is shattered when two jealous perverts, Raymond and Connie Marble(David Lochary and Mink Stole) want to steal her title of filthiest people alive. Raymond and Connie drive through streets looking for female hitchers then snatch them and force their hapless butler Channing(Channing Wilroy) to impregnate the girls then when the baby is born they sell it to lesbian couples and use the money to fund an inner-city grade school heroin ring and run their own pornography shops across town. In their meantime, they give each other toejobs and Raymond flashes his penis(Tied to a sausage) to innocent girls in their park. As soon as Divine finds out about this, she is furious and decides to start a war against them. This film actually wasn't John Waters first film as many people think, he had made a number of films before this(Hag in a Black Leather Jacket, Roman Candles, Eat Your Makeup, Mondo Trasho, The Diane Linkletter Story and Multiple Maniacs) but it was his first color film and i don't think it could work in anything besides color. Do you really think that the red dress Divine wears during the execution would be the same in a black and white film? I don't think so. This film definitely got him recognized for scenes such as the Chicken/Human sex scene, artificial insemination scene, blowjob and the ever so famous, dog sh*t eating scene. See this film as soon as you can. If you like this film, also consider picking up four of John Waters other trash epics, Mondo Trasho, Multiple Maniacs, Female Trouble and the classic Desperate Living.Eight out of Ten "},{"Title":"A great American comedy.

It's hard not to be defensive here.  Some have become too jaded and call it passe'; a healthy percentage are still absolutely shocked and revolted by it; and some sniff at its ultra-cheap production values and more or less roll their eyes.To the last group firstLET'S MAKE THIS CLEAR I love the cheapness of it.  I saw it on its 25-year re-release, and let me say, to see a movie that shoddy-looking, garish, and rough-edged on a big screen was like (perhaps ironically) a breath of fresh air.  More it's a slap in the face to Hollywood.  In the face of all the money and slickness and Ridley-Scott style being smeared across the theaters these days, a film as utterly Baltimorean as Pink Flamingos-- the ear-insulting narration sets the tone from the beginning-- can only be a step in the right direction back to Life in the cinema, and away from fussily polished, fretted-over imitation.To those who are still shocked good for you.  You have a healthy response to the situation.  John Waters has made a truly great American comedy, which is to say a comedy about what it means to be an American.  From Amy Fisher to Tonya Harding to O.J. Simpson, we have always, repeatedly, embraced trash; we dote on vulgarity.  A more intellectually opportunistic director would condemn us for that, and alienate us by being no fun.  Waters has taken satire to its next logical step.  He does not fight the enemy; he has laughed at, loved, and BECOME the enemy.  Anyone who watches a bit of reality television knows that there are people in this country who would do anything to become famous, let alone eat a little s---.  If Americans are willing to do that, John Waters is willing to smile and sell us the ticket to watch.  Make no mistake we'll buy it.To those unshockables who find it passe'?  Dated?  An artifact?

This is not to say, however, that the film isparticularly good. There is a technical shoddiness to the entireenterprise - long, under-rehearsed and unedited takes with endlesspanning and zooming - that undercuts whatever its creator, John Waters,may have wanted to say about the corrupt society he so clearly loves tohate (just compare the quality of Waters' own footage with thedocumentary footage shot by Steve Yeager in his award-winning DIVINETRASH, of John Waters actually at work filming PINK FLAMINGOS for allthe evidence you need of the director's lack of cinematographic skill).It's not that Waters lacks the ability to articulate his point of view;it's just that his directorial abilities tend to fall short of histhematic ambitions. You see, I am of the opinion that Waters' greatestgift is in the writing department. Directorially, his films show littlein the way of rhythm and focus. That is, perhaps, with perhaps one clearexception.DESPERATE LIVING is a genuinely Felliniesque epic with, at least in myview, far more scope than any of Waters' other work. In it, he createsan entire parallel universe, Morteville, where compulsory misery isenforced by legal decree. The principle cast is enormous and there justseems to be so much more going on than in anything else Waters has everdone. Mink Stole proves herself to be an actor of genuinely demonicintensity, while the physical production itself is clearly being guidedby a well-developed (if loopy) intelligence.In general, I prefer Waters' older films such as MULTIPLE MANIACS andFEMALE TROUBLE to such later efforts as CRY BABY and PECKER (a filmwhich I genuinely detest) - there's an immediacy and honesty to thosegrainy old 16mm films, a palpable kinetic joy not unlike theexhilaration one experiences while executing the perfect practical joke.Interestingly, DESPEPRATE LIVING is notable for the absence of Divine,Waters' principle star, who was unavailable at the time of production.Without her, the film seems somehow more balanced, less cluttered andeven more culturally subversive than its early-to-mid seventiescounterparts.Still, PINK FLAMINGOS is the Waters film against which all othersultimately will be judged. It is one of the most extreme works evercommitted to celluloid and a genuine cinematic Rorschach test. The filmpossesses many virtues a lively cast, a brilliantly ludicrous (andfunny) script and an almost pathological detrmination - or need - tooffend.Perhaps it's beside the point to complain too much about Waters'directorial abilities when it's so clear that his satirical skills arein such great form - the guy is a genuine cultural anthropologist andalmost as funny as Moliere.I just wish he would write more books.--------------------------- "},{"Title":"A class based analysis","Date":"5 May 2003","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Horror","Review":"  While many audiences have been shocked, appalled, titillated and confused by the vulgarity of John Waters' Pink Flamingos, I argue here that the film portrays the campy banality of the carnal while discreetly displaying the interaction between social classes and its relation to the profane. It has been said that horror and pornography are inextricably linked in the realm of the carnal; the provocation of physical bodily reactions sets them apart from their more cerebral counterparts though not necessarily through mutual exclusion. As Carol Clover has dubbed the body genres, horror and pornography fuse to form the union of Pink Flamingos. The plot of the film pits Mr. and Mrs. Marvel, an enterprising bourgeoisie couple of questionable taste and sexuality, against Divine, a female drag queen and veteran of Waters' films, who lives in a pink trailer with her family and a herd of lawn ornaments. In the film, the Marvels are attempting to 'out-filth' Divine at her own game, arguably what Waters is trying to do with the film itself in the context of middle-aged middle-classed whiteamerican heterosexual patriarchal ideology inherent in the male-dominated/based financially privileged bias of the film industry.Although the film flips the bird to standard notions of socially hegemonic class-based values, it remains trapped in its own flaxen net of privilege. Waters attempts to criticize and ridicule mainstream society through the over-the-top frequency of lewd and licentious situations but loses viewers in a sort of stimulation-apathy akin to being in a porn store for too long. The film comes off less as a critique of societal values and taboos than a self-indulgent stab at the avant-garde through smut, and this manifests itself in the failure of the Marvels to truly be the monarchs of filth. I argue that the failure of the Marvels to usurp Divine's title of filthiest person alive results from their social position relative to Divine and her kin. Divine's class is coded through her living situation (a trailer with no address), dress, hair, makeup, friends, eating habits, speech and incestuous relationship with her son, Crackers. These aspects are conspicuously low-class and conspicuously American. This is also well evidenced by a scene in which Divine struts down the park stairs, the veritable epitome of all that is not encompassed by the standard ideology of American principles, flanked by the old red-white and blue in the background. Indeed, it is surprising when we learn that the film is set on the East Coast and not in a southern backwater. On the other hand, the Marvels enjoy the luxury of an address (3900), conservative clothing, 'refined' dialect, lucrative businesses, servants and (arguably) mutual repression of their 'true' sexualities (she the bookish lesbian, he the flamboyant gay man) cloaked in the guise of holy matrimony. Ultimately, the bottom line here is that the Marvels are hindered in their aspirations to filth through their relative privilege. The Marvels can 'pass' in the everyday world, unlike Divine, and thus they can never achieve true 'filthiness' that those of lower socioeconomic status are forced to afford. When 'filth' is defined by the hegemony of white capitalist patriarchal upper-class heterosexual values, their aspirations to it are inherently negated. Thus, the Marvels never had any chance of taking the title from Divine because they are not fully able to transcend these boundaries.

The plot is decent, no real surprises. It's essentially about who is filthiest. The acting is awful. I didn't personally find anything in this to be funny, merely crossing boundaries, taboos. We have people with strange hair and names yelling at each other, being obnoxious, crass and crude(at times resembling The Addams Family in their behavior... without the humor, in my opinion).

I really don't know exactly what point John Waters was trying to get across with this; the film takes on a sort of sitcom style and mixes this with a barrage of filth, but there's no real point to the film other than simply showing how it's central characters live. The film is also really amateur and features no end of mistakes; yet in spite of this, Pink Flamingos is still a successful film as John Waters obviously wanted to disgust his audience, and the film certainly serves in doing that. Pink Flamingos focuses on the title 'The Filthiest Person Alive'. This is a title most people would want to avoid at all costs, but it's hotly contested in this film. The holder of this prestigious crown is a woman named Divine - murderer, thief and all round disgusting human being. She faces competition, however, from couple Raymond and Connie Marble, who believe that they are the filthiest people alive.Overall, I'd have to say that this film is not the most disgusting thing I've ever seen, but even so; it is pretty offensive. There are all sorts going on - from nudity (male, female and...errr...'other'), disgusting sex acts and nasty things being eaten. This is all brought up a level by the atmosphere - John Waters has created a truly sordid and filthy essence for his film, and just watching it is enough to make most people feel dirty. The cast is colourful to say the least and features drag queen and John Waters regular Divine at the helm. He's really not a great actor; but this film simply could not have been made without him in it. There's a very good reason why he earned a place in cinema history as the icon of bad taste. After the version of the film I saw there was word from the director and he talked about some of the scenes that were deleted. It looked to me like about 200% of the film ended up on the cutting room and that's really a shame. One of the problems with this film is that there's not really a strong plot to go on and had some of the deleted scenes had been left in; the film could have been much more. Even so, while Pink Flamingos will certainly not be everyone's cup of tea; if you want pure filth on screen; this is a good place to look for it!

No?!? Well apparently it is a common mission in Baltimore and the people striving to obtain this questionable title are prepared - determined, even - to undergo whatever humiliation it takes. I heard, read and have been warned numerous times before regarding the notorious reputation of John Waters' Pink Flamingos, but I honestly have to admit I still underestimated the film. How sickening could it possibly be? I thought, because it's an early seventies Independent film, accomplished with an extremely low budget and there are probably just a few isolated moments of genuine repulsion that undeservedly skyrocketed the film's reputation as a whole. I gladly admit my assumptions were wrong. Pink Flamingos truly is a non-stop spitfire of atrocities that are revolting and vomit inducing, but simultaneously fascinating and oddly humorous. It's virtually impossible to list the highlights of repulsiveness featuring in this film, because that would result in a detailed description of each and every scene. As previously stated, the film primarily revolves on the battle between two families in order to obtain the title of filthiest persons alive. In the left corner there's Divine and her trailer-trash alliance. Devine is an unscrupulous woman (yeah, right&#133;woman) who eats dog poo and throws extravagant birthday orgies for her circle of misfit friends. Her mother has an egg-fetish and lives in a cradle designed for toddlers. She runs off with the egg delivery man and lives happily ever after in one of the most romantic sequences ever captured on film &#133; Divine's son loves killing chickens whilst copulating on the first date, but his favorite of course remains oral sex from his mum. In the right corner we have the Marble family. This colorful (literally) couple runs a profitable business where they kidnap and impregnate random women and then subsequently sell the babies to lesbians. Mrs. Marble employs girls to spy on Devine's family whilst Mr. Marble goes around town practicing his hobby of exhibitionism. I suppose by now it's already needless to emphasize that John Waters' exercise in bad taste isn't meant of the eyes and stomachs of sensitive people. Personally, I can handle quite a bit of nauseating stuff but I honestly cringed over the endless sights of scat, anus-flexing, hermaphrodites, castration, incestuous fellatio, egg-talk, foot fetishes, chicken lovers and God knows what else. At several points in the film you wonder why the hell you keep on watching this film, but you simply can't stop! I can only presume this was exactly the effect Waters' hoped to achieve, so Pink Flamingos can definitely be considered a triumph on his account. The acting performances are deliberately &#150; and adorably &#150; hammy and, one thing's certain, they all enjoyed being a part of this production. I could write endless pages about the film and tell millions of anecdotes, but it all comes down to this Pink Flamingos is a unique cinematic experience and everyone with a curious sense of adventure (and a strong stomach) should own a copy.

This film is proof that you don't need a multi-million dollar budget to make a cinematic masterpiece...all you need is a good script and lots of shock value! From the singing butt hole scene, to the chicken copulation scene, right up to the final shocking scene where Divine eats dog feces this film is loaded with shocking scenes and is easily one of the most offensive films ever made! There are absolutely no holds barred in this shocker and nothing is sacred. Edith Massey is egg-cellent as the Egg Lady, Cookie Mueller is genius as Cookie the spy, Mary Vivian Pierce is equally charming as Cotton and Mink Stole and David Lochary portray the villanious Marbles brilliantly. Of course nothing beats the stellar performance of Lady Divine the Filthiest Person Alive who will stop at absolutely nothing to shock viewers!

I talked about it for months at school and my friends couldn't believe what I was saying. John Waters was a playful carefree nasty rebel who inspired a group of freaks and misfits that were equally up to the task of breaking every sacred cow that that they could, including the image of what a real film should look like. Even though the finial product was a trashy mix of super 8mm and 16mm shots, of non actors acing and garbage sets and costumes all resting firmly on the shoulders of Divine, the final product changes the way that American film makers thought about what they could and could not do. Just the fact that John Waters eventually became the darling of Hollywood shows how his trash cinema has been embraced by the entire media world. We need artists like John Waters, Robert Maplethorpe and Madonna to shake things up culturally and sexually so that we are not made slaves to a conservative or wholesome view of what we can and cannot create. "},{"Title":"A brave and sickly hilarious film that lives up to its notoriety","Date":"25 September 2006","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Horror","Review":" I love cinema. Always have, and probably, always will.But if there is one thing that annoys me about it, it is the fact that a very small amount of films live up to the hype and talk that surrounds them, good or bad. Rarely am I ever impressed throughly by a film, and even more rare is when the film actually lives up to what people are saying about it. Although it is not perfect by any stretch, I feel that John Waters' masterwork of sorts, Pink Flamingos, is one such film that lives up to everything that has been said about it, and more.The plot is simple. Divine has been proclaimed as the filthiest person alive, and is now living in a trailer out in the middle of nowhere with her family under the name Babs Johnson. Unfortunately, the Marbles, Raymond (David Lochary) and Connie (Mink Stole), feel they rightfully deserve the title, and set into motion a series of plans to challenge her title reign.It is not much, but the film stretches this plot line through ninety-plus minutes of some of the most disgusting and vile acts ever put to celluloid. The only modern thing I could possibly compare it to are the gross-out gags (and not silly stunts) from Jackass, and even they are pretty tame compared to this. Without going into a whole lot of detail, you will be mortified, disgusted, offended and you may just catch yourself in hysterics. This film pulled out all the stops, and thankfully (if that is indeed the right word) did not have to sacrifice anything to get into theatres. It is completely uncut and untouched from Waters' original vision, and for that, is an obvious rise above everything we have now, which is forced to be decent and politically correct.It is obvious then why this film became and continues to stay popular. Even though standards have changed, this film still manages to feel contemporary. It bravely stands its ground, and does everything that any movie could possibly want to do and more. It is unflinching in its graphic sexual depictions, and even more so in some of the overly vile situations the characters find themselves in. This movie was made and shown to the public the way it was originally envisioned, not by the way of what someone else wanted. This is the type of film that everyone in Hollywood wishes they were a part of. In an age where political correctness is forced, and controversy is avoided, this movie represents everything that a 2006 audience cannot see on a movie screen. In this way, it is both sad and touching to note what our society has evolved into 34 years after this film. And it is only ironic to note that it was released the exact same year as the pornographic classic, Deep Throat.If there is anything wrong in my mind with the film (content notwithstanding), it is my issue with the motivation of the Marbles. Yes, the acting is totally amateur, and yes, some of the dialogue is absolutely horrendous, but for the point of the film to really be about a challenge to a title, you would think there would be a reason for the challenge in the first place. To me, it just seems like the Marbles randomly want something that someone else has. Hell, they are not even nearly as filthy as they seem to want to be (or claim to be for that matter). Everything else seems to be well expressed and thoughtfully put to the screen, except for this. Did Waters just not know what to do for these characters, or did he just happen to leave it out thinking it was not all that important? It aggravated me to no end while watching the film, and still does as I write this. It is too easy a detail to miss, and for that reason, feels incomplete in my mind.But while some of the actors just barely make an attempt at being serious in the light of the ridiculous humour of the whole film, Divine stands above them all. Her (or his) performance is electric and is the stuff of legend. If Waters made bad taste more mainstream, than Divine was the reason why people took notice. This is the real actor of the bunch, and the real reason why this film did so well initially. People wanted to see Divine do sick and twisted things, and look good doing it. She is believable as this notorious figure, and even the shoddiest of dialogue sounds poetic coming from her. It really is a shame that she (or he) did not break out of these low-budget B-movies. Yes, Divine made a name for herself with the help of John Waters (as he did with Divine), but you cannot help but wonder what would have happened if Divine moved into the realm of the mainstream.While I definitely enjoyed the film, I cannot help but fathom that I will probably never be able to endure watching the film in its entirety again. It has a lasting feel to it, and I can only hope that more people watch it, but I just do not think I will ever have it in me to give the film another whirl. But I must concede that I will always have the utmost respect for it, and will always tell the right people looking for a hearty laugh to give it a shot. The content might be a little hard to take, but if a movie like Jackass can make people laugh, then I am sure that Pink Flamingos can deliver even more so.6/10.

It is not for anyone who is even the slightest bit religious or squeamish, and tries its very hardest to offend.

As bizarre as this film gets there's a real sense of camaraderie among the cast members, and I think this quality will continue to endear this film to its cult followers after the shock value has worn off--in their very unconventional way Babs, Crackers, Cotton and Mama Edie really are family. Not that the shock value of Pink Flamingos'has gone down all that much yet--it may not be quite as disturbing as it was in the pre-Springer seventies, but the most disgusting scenes (the mother-son fellatio, the henhouse orgy, Divine gobbling the dog turd as though it were a tootsie roll) would be hard to top even today. Actually the scene I was most dreading--the cannibalizing of the police--turned out to be one of the least disturbing as the props had so obviously come from a butcher's shop. The film is also extremely funny at times if you've got a strong stomach--I'm thinking in particular of the the scene in which Bab mincing through the grocery store in her very proper halter dress shoplifts a steak. Quite an enjoyable film if you have a taste for the offbeat and are not easily offended, but if you buy or rent it beware letting it fall into the hands of family members who only know Divine from Hairspray.

I can understand how someone could walk out of this movie, or call it vile, but I think those people took it too seriously.  I mean, how seriously can you take a movie about two different families competing for the title of `filthiest people alive'?  Maybe it's because I had already heard all of the buzz about the movie, so I came into it prepared to be grossed out, and ready to laugh (which I did a LOT), in any case, Pink Flamingos may hold some underlying message about the lower ends of society (which I wasn't exactly able to pull out, I was laughing too hard) it's still a movie that goes out it's way to be shocking and grotesque, and the wrong audience seeing it definitely brings out a strong negative reaction. After the film, I couldn't help but wonder how Waters made this movie. All of Waters' films have their own strange style to them, but some of the things that were in this movie were completely insane (i.e. the male stripper with the fluctuating anus).  I was baffled by the idea that someone had all of these ideas in his head, and the only thing I could picture in my mind was John Waters sitting at his desk with a pad of paper and a pencil listing out every single taboo he could possibly come up with.  This movie was fun for everyone, in the sense that I think there was something for everyone to feel disgusted by.  I mean, this movie had everything.  I think the best portrayal of this is the job description of the Marbles.  They are a couple who kidnap young hitchhiking girls, have their butler rape/impregnate them, keep them locked in a basement, and they die after childbirth they sell the babies to lesbian couples, using the money to fund porno shops and a heroin ring in elementary schools.  Besides the ridiculous number of taboos listed above, the film also tackles incest, murder, beastiality, robbery and vandalism, etc (not the mention the great Divine eating dog shit). I think one of the most interesting characters of the movie was Divine's mother, Edie.  Reading reviews claiming this woman was a 250 pound grown woman that never left her play pen, and ate nothing other that eggs, was a vast understatement.  The thing that baffles me the most about this character is how in the world they found someone to play her.  Edith Massey, the woman who did play Edith, was said to have had trouble remembering lines for the movie, so they had to cut some out.  This stuns me, considering her lines didn't seem to consist of anything more than cries out for the egg man.  So, is this woman really like this in real life?  This leads to another important aspect of the film, it's reality.  I've read that the dog feces Divine ate were real, and I cannot help but believe that the chickens killed in the rough sex scene between Cookie and Crackers were actually killed (if they weren't, it was disturbingly realistic).  The reality of this film, I believe, is it's strongest aspect.  We're not bombarded with cutaways and silhouettes or what is going on, we see everything. Understandably, some found this honesty and reality to be revolting.  A scene to pops out in my head is when Divine performs oral sex on Crackers, her son in the film.  It's not often we see those kinds of things, so graphically, in movie theaters that don't have `XXX' in the title.  The truthfulness of the film (along with some poor camera work) gave the film a real documentary feel.  Obviously, the film was fiction, but because of the look of the film and it's lack of inhibitions, I felt like everything I was watching was actually real, no holds barred.

Babs Johnson grew up in a very non-typical home. Blatantly, you can see the impact this had on society through her actions up to the ending where she engulfs dog feces.  Was this film just some sick and twisted perversion of endless gut-wrenching occurrences, or was it symbolic of something much deeper?  To side with the first would be the easy way out and to the side with the latter might seem demented, but possibly true. The film does have some credible resemblance to actual events of our societal past.  Every leader that we as people view as `horrible' displays similar characteristics to those of Babs Johnson.  Ivan the Terrible, Genghis Khan, Adolph Hitler, and Joseph Staling all had `troubling' childhoods.  Babs Johnson had a troubling childhood and therefore is associated in the same class as all of the previous mentioned rulers. That is why a great deal of her actions throughout the film can be seen as disturbing.  However, were her actions her own fault or society's for letting her grow up the way she did.     Furthermore, each character in this film represents either a past leader or event. Another coincidence is Edith's obsession with eggs.  With an open mind this can be tied into the genocide and Hitler's attempt to annihilate the Jews. Some view Hitler as a genius, others a mad man.  John Waters must have seen him as a mad man because his representation Edith was indeed mentally ill. Edith's son Crackers and traveling companion Cotton are symbolic of what was wrong in our own backyard, slavery.  Both names, are slang terms that represent a time period that most of us would rather forget.  Theses characters are crucial in terms that it points out that in some times, our society in America was no better than what we often view as horrendous acts of social onslaught in other cultures.  The chicken f**king scene is the epitome of what was wrong in our society in this time period and is still wrong.  Chicken, is a 1970's slang term for woman.  Therefore it might be possible that John Waters were trying to bring out the subject of rape through Cotton and Crackers actions. The antagonist family, if a single antagonist can be determined in this film, was the Marble's.  Marble is often mentioned in association with wealth.  Therefore this may be symbolic of the struggle between the poor and the wealthy a fight that still continues on today and will probably continue on forever.  Pink Flamingos is a monumental film for its disturbing scenes but should also be noted for its camouflaged political agenda that Waters displayed so affluently throughout its entirety.

I love it!","Date":"10 November 2004","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Horror","Review":" I think that Water's captured, quite excellently, the meaning of filth. I thought I knew what was gross and disturbing, but this film shed light on things that I never thought went through people's minds. I can't think of any film that executes what it set out to do with such precision. The characters are great,but the acting is a bit unrefined. I think that was done on purpose. Just like all those great horror films that were all about the gore factor and less interested in the actual lines said, this follows in those footsteps. I wanted to vomit 1/2 way into it, but kept watching anyway. It was worth it . I like my movies extreme, and this one is definently that. It is a great film for everyone. By all means watch this movie once. That's probably all you will need.

It's filled with filthy imagery, filthy motifs, filthy characters, filthy language, and about everything filth, and in a stunning match of style towards substance, is pretty filthily filmed, directed, and edited.But I don't really care. John Waters had his fun, I had a few giggles and a few moments of, Hmmm, maybe I shouldn't be watching this with my roommates around..., but I can't really seem to care much further than that. It's primary purpose is shock value, and, well...It's dated. Oh no he didn't! Yes, yes I did. It's dated. That just goes to show which direction our society has gone, really, but honestly I've seen much more disgusting and worse.It's called the Internet. You know, Goatse, weird forms of pornography, all that... One doesn't even search for it, it's just there.This stuff is very disgusting, and it succeeds at being unpleasant to watch, but stuff like that is all over the place now. I honestly don't see why people care anymore.--PolarisDiB "},{"Title":"This movie needs to be seen only once","Date":"14 May 2001","Score":"2 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Horror","Review":"  The total value of this movie is shock value.  Once you know what is coming, it has no further socially redeeming value.  If you are an animal rights activist, stay away from this movie, because it contains a couple of humans in a three way with a chicken(ouch!).One thing seems to have been ahead of its time, it shows a (real) female wearing men's underwear circa, 1970.I repeat this movie is only for the most jaded perverts seeking the most outlandish and disgusting of vicarious thrills.

Yes, there was a time when revolting irony actually had a  place. Yes, self-aware stoned parody seems a necessary sophomoric step for every kid.But that makes `Flamingoes' of historical interest, not necessary worth watching today. It  is more `Coven' than `Eraserhead.' And it is why this documentary is better than all  Waters' films until `Pecker,' where he learned (and could afford) ironically detached  ironic irony rather than self-abusive voyeuristic pseudo-irony.The appearance of the now-retired film censor who encountered `Flamingoes' is a cheap  shot, sort of an afterglow from cheap wine on top of a speed binge it works but at what  cost?Irony is a much expanded concept in film because it forgives all. But the very existence  of this documentary is very weird it expands the notion and breaks it.The idea behind Waters' sort of shock-trash is that it is off-hand, disposable. To  `document' it reverses that. To go further and celebrate its influence and permanence in  film history sort of defeats the purpose. Its as if you celebrated a jazz solo by talking to  the musician about fingering. Its all the more shocking when you discover that someone  was filming the filmer in 1972. Ask now why do that? And all the value deflates. Why do that? Because the shock value is  what matters, not the destructive irony. Watch Hartley if you want genuine.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.  "}]
