[{"Title":"An action sequel","Date":"15 January 2006","Score":"26 out of 30 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" In the tradition of other horror movie franchises, Phantasm takes the action route for this sequel. The horror and sci-fi are still there but there's more combat, stuff blowing-up and gore than there was before. I suppose it does keep things fresh but it does get a bit too tongue-in-cheek sometimes. Kinda like Evil Dead II, I'm not sure if this really fits in with the tone set by the first film.Phantasm II begins right after where the first film left off. The freaky dwarfs have invaded Mike's home and Reggie must foil the Tall Man's attempts at kidnapping him. Flash forward seven years and Mike is in a mental institution. He is released upon admitting that the whole Phantasm experience was made up only to find that in his absence the Tall Man has been plundering many of America's small towns and thousands of graves are empty.After the Tall Man kills Reggie's family in a gas explosion, Reg teams up with Mike to hunt him down and kick his head in...again. All they have to do is follow the trail of dead people, right? And this time they are ready for whatever outlandish tricks he's ready to play on them, armed to the teeth with quadruple-barrelled shotguns, flame-throwers and chainsaws. Complicating matters are Mike's inexplicable visions of the future and psychic connections to a mysterious girl he has never met before.As before, the Tall Man is the best thing in the film. Angus Scrimm is so wonderfully silent and unholy that no matter how slick and entertaining the rest of the film is he'll come out on top.Don Coscarelli was given a budget 10 times that of the original by Universal, but they did interfere with production quite a lot, much to his annoyance. They said that only one of the original cast members could return, so he chose Reggie Bannister and re-cast Mike with James LeGros (after turning down Brad Pitt!). It does kind of ruin the continuity a bit but it's not terribly distracting.They also demanded a more simple and linear story, so don't expect any of the bizarre dream sequences and flashbacks. If you're a big fan of the first this might seem disappointing but you know how studios love to think less of their audiences.The higher budget helps Phantasm to have a bigger scope than the original. The first half of the film feels like a road movie with lots of pretty scenery while the rest is kind of like a low-rent Ghostbusters/Lost Boys clone. Which sounds like a negative point, but the hokey tone of the film vanishes when it heads off into HP Lovecraft territory.If you're looking for answers as to what the first film was all about then you won't find many. In fact it raises more questions than anything else. But it's still a fun ride. I'm just kind of annoyed that the music took the more generic synth approach that was common in the 80's instead of the funky 70's beats we got before. The main Phantasm theme is still there for your enjoyment however and gets a great finish on the end credits.

Coscarelli rather than recycling the plot of the first, instead adds a new flavour to help keep the sequel not only fresher, but also makes the film a Action/Horror road movie, rather than a surreal like Horror/Drama that the original was. When watching the film, it becomes readily apparent that the film is much higher budgeted than what Coscarelli had to work on the original film. Unlike what most film-makers would do, when working on a bigger budgeted sequel to a film of theirs, Coscarelli doesn't waste money on familiar actors, but rather sticks to casting no name, fresh faced actors in the film & spends his money more wisely on special effects & stunts & it really shows here. For starters we get a good look at the Lurkers ghoulish looking faces, zombie make-up, a mutated monster erupting from a girls back & there's a car chase. A decent car & house explosion, a chainsaw duel, better special effects & visual effects, including a gold sphere that can shoot out a laser beam that can blow up anything that moves, a drill like device that can erupt from it & this time there are three spheres! a much better done heat seeking Silver Sphere POV & an incredible melting man effect & a silver sphere burrowing under a Pallbearers spine, through his stomach & up through his throat, before getting stuck in his mouth! The set design for the mausoleums & the deserted, decaying towns & cemeteries are very well done & the fourbarrelled shot gun, chainsaws & home made flame thrower weapons the hero's use are pretty awesome. Coscarelli also adds some Gothic, Hammer horrorish elements, mainly from two deathly pale pallbearers who are assisting the Tall Man in his evil quests, & Gas masked Grave Diggers. The acting is better than the first & Coscarelli again does very good behind the camera. However it's also clear when watching the film, that Coscarelli did not have as much control over this film as he did the first one, which he raised the money for himself. PHANTASM II remains the only studio backed entry to the series & as a result one can well see the studio's fingerprints all over it. For one, Mike is played by then newcomer JAMES LeGROS, who actually performs quiet well as Mike, but it just doesn't feel like a real PHANTASM movie without A. MICHAEL BALDWIN playing the role, he's really missing here & it shows. Minus REGGIE BANNISTER (who also had to audition for his role in order to keep it) & ANGUS SCRIMM & Director Coscarelli, none of the crew of the first returned here. The film has also lost it's surreal like dream quality look & feel that the original had, for a more linear approach. Also gone is the psychological undertones of the first & the mystery surrounding the Tall Man & the Dwarfs are kept as ambiguous as ever. The gore scenes also disappoint, since most of the gore footage wound up on Universal Studio's cutting room floor. PHANTASM II is virtually bloodless, minus a quick cut shot of a sliced off ear & brief blink & you'll miss them shots, of brains being drilled out via the flying spheres & shot out back of it & the puddle of blood on the floor, before said victim collapses. The gore is very watered down & we also get to see a badly charred burned hand, very briefly pass a small porthole window, on a crematorium, that one of the Pallbearer's was tossed into & Reggie thrusts a chainsaw into a gravediggers groin (off screen), a severed hand etc. It also adds a voice over narration from both Liz, Mike & Reggie. The film also introduces not one but two teen psychic characters, Mike & another girl named LIZ (PAULA IRVINE) the two eventually meet & strike up a relationship in a somewhat out of place teen love angle, that I felt again was not only out of place, but also didn't really gel well in the films story. If you were to take it out you would still have a movie, thankfully Coscarelli doesn't care for it either & doesn't spend to much time with it. There are some slow spots to be had, the introduction to Liz kind of slows down the picture. ANGUS SCRIMM seems to be having ball playing the Tall Man & plays the role with such sadistic glee, he really is a fun villain & deserves more recognition within the horror community, than what he has gotten over the years. All in all, PHANTASM II is pretty fast moving & highly enjoyable. Some people tend to prefer this over the original. To be honest I can't say I am one of them, since I prefer the original films eeriness & surreal dream like qualities to straight laced action/horror which this film is. Love the Hemicuda the hero's travel in. Look for LETHAL WEAPON'S own, KENNETH TIGAR as a priest who knows what is going on & attempts to stop the terror & a ROBOCOP tribute where we see Alex Murphy's headstone in the cemetery, but his body has went missing, since the Tall Man has had it dug up in order to shrink it to the size of a dwarf!. Love the scene where SAM (SPIDER-MAN/EVIL DEAD) RAIMI'S ashes are being put in a bag, by one for the morgue attendants. The down beat ending is utterly silly & just a re-staging of the first films closing shot, but is original & not done often (the bad guys win & the hero's wind up dying).

Despite Universal's interference and insistence on a less dreamlike narrative (the backbone of all the other Phantasms), director Don Coscarelli manages to give this installment the most polished look and measured, exciting pace of the series.While being stuck telling a more on-the-surface story than the first film, he manages to plant extremely frightening, original, surrealistic images throughout the film that stick in the viewer's mind forever(I first saw this when I was 12 in a theater, and have never forgotten it). A priest's worried look over his shoulder at his empty town; a writhing, screaming parasite burning to death.. auto parts hanging from a burning tree after a car crash..gasmasked beings carting exhumed coffins across a porcelain hallway; an abandoned mortuary..full of freshly lit candles! The stark simplicity of the doorway to the villain's homeworld. Hooded creatures storming Reggie's kitchen in the dark. And on, and on..The story is simple enough, seven years after the original a teenaged Mike (now played by James Le Gros) is released from an asylum and is immediately drawn back into the Tall Man's game, traveling through an emptied America into a nightmare that could very well all be in his mind. This early in the series, the mysterious Tall Man is just that.. he probably has ten minutes screen time in the film, and yet the mood and pacing always make you nervous that he'll appear behind you and cart you off to be part of his experiments. Where IS he? What is he doing when we do not see him? This lack of resolution actually works for the picture's benefit, and not against it. Indeed, though Phantasm spawned an additional two intelligent, emotional sequels, as we learned more about the villain Mike and Reggie are up against, we're much less frightened of him.Angus Scrimm is at his creepiest in this installment. Reggie begins to take his place as audience favorite, a reluctant hero on par with Ash (Evil Dead) and Dr. Loomis. Le Gros does well as the buff but still doubtful Mike. Kudos to character actor Kenneth Tigar for his role as the tortured priest, who can't close his eyes to the things he's seen, who manages to draw us in with his nuanced, emotional performance. He could have easily shown up to give exposition and get killed, instead he manages to keep the viewer hooked AND meet his untimely end.Full of suspense, scares, and action, Phantasm II may not be the mindbender of the original, but it's no a less worthy chapter of the most surrealistic, thought-provoking horror series ever created.

There is a reason why LeGros has appeared in a great deal more than Baldwin (including a hilarious parody of Brad Pitt in Living in Oblivion) and shows it here in spades. Frankly I feel this was as good or better than the first but the required shock ending that punctuates each of the films in this series has grown tiresome and makes each feel like they do not truly stand on their own as their own experience. Nevertheless, the entire series is original, imaginative and involving. Phantasm II really should have capped off the series with it's big budget backing, as the very next film in the series felt a lot like Alien 3 where the film picks up characters from the second film discarded in a very unfortunate and disappointing manner...but I digress. Phantasm II is solid, quad barrel shotgun monster blasting fun and a must see for monster movie fans everywhere!

While it has an effective atmosphere and an interesting array of characters, the plot certainly could have been more carefully written.  There is one part where Mike risks his life handling a very dangerous flying sphere and uses it as a key to open some weird door, but the movie fails to show the purpose of opening that door.  Sure, it shows you what lies behind the door, but that's it! Mike and his friends don't really do anything in there! Also, the Tall Man goes through the trouble of luring Liz into a trap, but he just throws her against a wall once he catches her.  If Liz was such a threat to his evil plans (as the plot asserts), then wouldn't the Tall Man want to make sure she's dead?  Still, when you have a couple psychics, an ex-ice cream vendor, a mysterious hitchhiker, an army of dwarves, flying spheres and a rather omnipotent--and scary-looking--old guy called the Tall Man rolled into one picture, the movie promises to be interesting, and it delivers for the most part.Compared to the other Phantasm movies, I liked Phantasm II better than Phantasm III and Phantasm Oblivion, but it's not quite as good as the original Phantasm.

His film used great special effects and a very creepy score by Fred Myrow (Soylent Green, Rubin and Ed). Nine years later, Coscarelli teamed up with actors Reggie Banister and Angus Scrimm again to make the appropriately titled, Phantasm II.While certainly not as creepy as the first film, Phantasm II is certainly very fun. Coscarelli was able to use better special effects than in the first film and it certainly is noticeable. Also, this sequel goes with the Evil Dead II logic of bigger is better. Chainsaw duels and explosions are added, not to mention an arsenal of extremely cool weapons including a home made flamethrower and a really cool double shotgun. But bigger is not always better...One problem that this film has is that it does not capture the coming of age theme that the first film has. While this is understandable because all the characters have aged nine years, the feeling the first film had of investigating something creepy in town is something we can all relate to. Stand by Me, Blue Velvet, and the first Phantasm all used this very appropriately, but I only wish that the sequel did as well. Another problem I have is that the character of Mike is so different. In the first he was a curious youngster (similar to Jeffrey Beaumont in Blue Velvet) but he is much different in this film, as he is much more level headed. However, it is better that his character has changed because he fits the mood of this film.Phantasm II is not a spectacular film, but I really do enjoy it, and that's why I rate it a nine out of ten. It is a rather different film from the first, but is still extremely fun, and that's the reason why I rate it as one of my favorites. Don't go expecting the same mood of Phantasm, but rather the mood of Army of Darkness...THIS MOVIE GETS BONUS POINTS FOR...Angus Scrimm, great special effects, creepy soundtrack "},{"Title":"probably the best in the best horror series ever!!!","Date":"19 January 2001","Score":"11 out of 17 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  I can't explain in words how much I love the Phantasm series.  Each film is a direct continuation of the last and each time we get answers to questions about The Tall Man while at the same time more are being asked.  Phantasm II is probably my fave in the series not because of the action (most phans say it's the most action packed but I think part III holds that honor) but really this is the only one where Reggie and Mike are side by side and in my opinion thats why it's the best (in all the others Reggie being the horn dog he is is trying to find mike AND get laid...which is still cool).  I can't believe that no other phans have mentioned how much Phantasm II mirrors Evil Dead 2 (I know they've had to notice it) that however is not a problem cause right next to the Phantasm series is the Evil Dead series.  Just look at it and you will see what I'm talking about.  Phantasm II follows Evil Dead 2 by going into comedy at times, others have complained that Phantasm III had comedy but they for some reason they forget II did also....it just wasn't as campy but still was funny, like when Reggie beat a dwarf creature into pieces by going crazy on it with the end of a shot gun or the look on his face when Alchemy is riding him and smacks him on top of his head and when he pulls a chainsaw on the graver at the end only for the graver to pull out a really LONG chainsaw...and of course just about everything Reggie says is funny.  And like Ash getting equipped with his chainsaw in ED 2 Reggie gets his now trademark 4-barrel shotgun, and the scene where the mortician gets a sphere in his back and bounces all over the room makes me think of ED 2. But believe me Phantasm II is not a copy cat of ED 2.  It still has some creepy stuff in it like the scene where the grandfather is getting his mouth sewn up.  But this movie screams atmosphere more than anything, with it's great score and visual style really helping to push that home.  All the actors give great performances and The Tall Man is the ultimate villain thanks to a great creepy performance by Angus Scrimm...all he's gotta do is twitch an eyebrow.  Also the scene where the priest gets it is really cool (you can tell that the MPAA made them trim it though but thats just my opinion).  But I think what really separates this horror series from most is that in almost all the other you root for Freddy, Jason, or Michael Myers and even though I love The Tall Man (God bless you Mr. Scrimm) Reggie is without a doubt THE man.  Some people may have Indiana Jones or any of those guys as their fave characters but mine will always be Reggie (played perfectly by Reggie Bannister) along with the Ash character from Evil Dead (Bruce Campbell...need I say more), Herbert West from the Re-Animator series (Jeffrey Combs...one of the funniest actors around) and the best character Kurt Russell (no introduction needed) EVER played....no it's not Snake Plissken...but Jack Burton from the great Big Trouble in Little China. Sorry for going off on a rant there just wanted you to know.  Anyways Reggie is the glue that holds the series together.  Why Universal has not put this and part III out on DVD is beyond me, yet they will do another DVD edition of The Mummy remake.  I think the reason this series is not as well known is because of the studio's killing it's chances (check out the web site on how they released Phantasm II) and instead of going in different directions to gain mass appeal (like the Elm Street series....which if I'm right Don Coscarelli was offered to direct part 2...the most under appreciated of that series) the Phantasm series as they went (and hopefully go) on tried to please it's core audiance.  And the series keeps the same characters through out so you really care for these guys and like them want to know what the hell is going on.  I love these movies more than any other series and hope they are continued to be made.  Hopefully we will see that Roger Avary penned script be made into a movie soon.

We've got a chainsaw dual, cool characters in the Reg-man, Mike, and the Tall Man, and a hell of a lot of action!! Right from the opening title when you hear the atmospheric theme (which is amazing by the way), the tone is set and you know you're in for something special.With the help of some dark and fantastical imagery, the story is laid out. Mike and Reggie are hunting down the Tall Man, a mysterious undertaker from another world who plunders graveyards and carts the dead off to be crushed into evil slave midgets. The movie strikes a chord with some of its imagery, especially those of embalming. What better way to be reminded of your mortality than to see a cadaver having his mouth sewn shut, and later another being drained of his blood and pumped with chemicals? Perhaps the Tall Man sums it up best when he says, You think when you die you go to heaven? You come to US!! It may make you uncomfortable to think about such things, but that is the point, at least partially.Don't get up to get a beer on this one either. The movie has such a quick pace, you'll be left behind and might miss one of the many memorable scenes Reggie and Mike walking through an empty graveyard, Father Meyer's encounter with a sphere, the quad-barreled shotgun, or the aforementioned chainsaw dual!!All in all, Phantasm II is a film that surpasses its predecessor (itself a classic) and takes you on a 90-minute roller-coaster ride.

Don Coscarelli has stated many times that he never intended part I to be followed by a sequel, so if you check out the continuity between the two, it's incredibly perfect and accurate in this one. (In my opinion, it's got the best prologue of the saga). Phantasm II picks up the best things of Part I and takes the plot onto a whole new direction (a path that will be followed by the other sequels). Guys, if there's a Phantasm Saga it's because of Part 2.Apart from this, all ingredients and characters are very well balanced and developed (horror, sci-fi, action, humor, Alchemy, the priest). If, for example, you compare P2 next to P3, you'll realize that sense of humor goes over the top in the latter. Also, P3 seems to forget that the real main hero of the story is Mike. OK, Reggie is my favorite character, but I've always thought that he works better as a sidekick (P2) rather than as the leading guy.Another important reason is that, to me, this is the darkest and most adult entry in the series it's got the goriest moments and the creepiest atmosphere, and takes the plot very seriously. Special effects are great too (although being a low budget B-movie, and the cheapest film produced by Universal in 1988, it looks like a super-production). And what can we say about the girls? Liz is the best partner Mike will ever have, and Chemy the most dangerous and sexiest chick Reggie will ever meet. Next to these characters, the other girls in the series look terribly under-developed (Lady in Lavender in Part I, Jennifer in part IV) or too far out (Rocky and Edna in Part III).Some people complaint that this sequel, unlike its predecessor, spells everything out for you. No doubt P2 is the most linear installment in the series, but that doesn't necessary mean that spells everything out for you. OK, more dream sequences wouldn't have been bad, but I prefer a standard plot well developed and executed rather than a twisted story full of holes, forced elements and unsatisfying explanations (P3 and P4).P2 is separated from P1 almost 10 years in time. Universal Pictures planned that the target audience for P2 should include people who never saw the original. They didn't want to take too many risks with the sequel of a movie that wasn't a huge success at the time and was released a decade before. That's the main reason why Universal executives forced Coscarelli to cast somebody else for Mike's part and write a more linear plot without mixing dreams and reality. Because of this, P2 is the only installment in the series that you can watch and understand without having seen P1.Now, James LeGros is THE BEST Mike EVER. He portrays a strong, tough, grown up Mike. But he can also look sensitive and fragile. Michael Baldwin was great in Part I, but sometimes, when an actor grows up, he doesn't fit in the same role as good as in the past. In P3 and P4, Baldwin looks weak and lost, and his lack of charisma and sex appeal is what makes Reggie take the leading part. James LeGros is a better actor, and a better choice for Mike.

I missed Phantasm II while I was living in Colombia, So I decided to take a delayed-by-25-years look! My psyche was all set to enjoy PHANTASM II to the max! I hadn't seen much in the horror/terror genre in recent years, because I really don't like the direction the genre has been going in throughout the past 1/4 century. 8 to 9* was what I was hoping for...I was somewhat disappointed, but will give it 7*.Let's talk about P-2 for a moment...The whole film is based around sustaining a mood of imminent danger, a foreboding atmosphere. If you agree to go along with it, providing suspension of disbelief, you'll probably get a nice kick out of P-2. IMHO elements of the film, music, sound effects, lighting, pacing, etc., all contribute well to that end. So if you are genre-friendly , let's bump my 7* UP to 8*! If the horror/terror genre usually isn't your cup of tea, well let's round DOWN to 6*...Fair enough? In this case, I'd say having seen the original PHANTASM would add tend to add a Star to rating P-2, so it does help, but isn't absolutely indispensable.I really had forgotten how much gruesome gore there was in the original. There's probably even more here, but a lot less than in recent offerings, undoubtedly influenced by PHANTASM 1 and 2, like the SAW franchise (YECH!) As is typically the case in B movies, the acting and dialog usually leave a lot to be desired, but, hey, we don't watch these scouting for potential Oscar-nominees, now do we?!? Bottom-line ALL of you who are, or have been horror/terror film buffs; a semi-cult classic you won't want to miss, or that you'll want to REDUX! If not in the above group...MAYBE NOT!

A decent actor and he handles all of the surreal horror well but he's just not the same lad we travelled alongside in the first movie and that DOES make a difference when the other, familiar faces are being played by the same people (namely, Angus Scrimm as The Tall Man and Reggie Bannister as Reggie). The other problem, and one that would crop up in every future instalment, is the way that Coscarelli paints himself into a corner and then has to contort his way out of it. Perversely, this makes for some added entertainment value at the same time but it does throw up a number of jarring inconsistencies and moments that take you out of the scary world you were immersed in.The plot throws us straight back into pursuit mode as young Michael and Reggie pursue The Tall Man, finding evidence of his presence in many American small towns and always getting close but not quite close enough until, conveniently, nearer the end of the movie. Along the way, we learn a little bit more about the plans he has and the practices he has in place to make them become a reality.Paula Irvine and Samantha Phillips add some enjoyable female company this time around but they're really not given that much to do (at least, not until the fun finale). Phillips, especially, is basically used as an exposition tool although it's certainly a unique way to get characters up to speed. As things veer ever closer to the ridiculous you have to make a conscious decision to either go along with the movie completely or to let things like realism and logic ruin your enjoyment. I went with the former option and had a lot of fun that way.See this if you like Phantasm, Bubba Ho-tep, Evil Dead II.

Arriving nearly ten years after its predecessor and in a decidedly different climate, Phantasm II shifts gears from the creepy, dream-like original to a unique action/horror hybrid and passes with flying colors. While the tone is noticeably different from the first, most of the elements that made the original so special are re-arranged to make something altogether different and ultimately, well, fun.Picking up where we left off in the original, Reggie (Reggie Bannister) and Mike (re-cast from Michael Baldwin to James LeGros) effectively send the Tall Man (Angus Scrimm) packing. Unfortunately, after spending a number of years in a mental hospital, Mike starts having visions of his foe as well as a mysterious young girl (Paula Irvine). Together with his surrogate big brother, he goes on a cross-country quest to track down the Tall Man and defeat him once and for all.Phantasm II is a rare case of a sequel breaking away from the format of the original and succeeding in its own right. The film makes nods to horror movies of its time -- there's a bit of Elm Street and Evil Dead sprinkled throughout -- and it's remarkable how well it comes together. Coscarelli does an excellent job of keeping the pace going while balancing ambitious ideas and bizarre special effects. It's not quite as challenging as its predecessor, but that's part of the film's charm. Bannister is as game as always as the lovable Reggie, while LeGros steps into Baldwin's shoes effortlessly. The two have excellent chemistry together and the journey they take is every bit as fun and the frenzied finale the film offers.From front to back, Phantasm II is good old spooky fun from the late '80s as only Coscarelli could deliver. And if that's not enough for you, there are still two more enjoyable sequels to plow through. Phantasm II is but a landmark in one of the most bizarre and unique horror series of its time.

I've seen hundreds of horror films since then, but Phantasm was not an easy one to forget so it wasn't to hard to get back into the rhythm of Don Coscarelli's world. Before jumping ahead seven years, Phantasm II picks up moments after the first ended, which is a pretty bizarre place. My one complaint about Phantasm was that the ending made no sense, and felt like a kick in the teeth. The sequel rationalizes it a bit, but there is still much to explain. However before long you, get into the rhythm of the film and go with it. Michael (now 19) has just left a re-hab centre where he spent the last seven years receiving treatment for his 'apparent' paranoid delusions of the Tallman. Needless to say, he still believes in what he saw, so after he gets out, he teams up with is middle aged buddy Reggie, and the two arm themselves to the teeth and hit the highway to track down the Tallman, who is still on the loose pilaging graveyards. Along the way they team up with Mike's girl Elizabeth, whom he hasn't seen in years. The Tallman is their mutual enemy.Because this is a sequel, less time is needed for exposition and more time can be dedicated to the chase. While some things haven't changed, (the special effects are still cheesy, and the acting is sub par) There is a more breezy (and subsequently gory) sense of goofy fun to Phantasm II. It certainly hints that it doesn't take itself seriously, and even throws in a little humour. Film Buffs will crack up at one particular moment which pays a sick homage to Sam Raimi.Few horror franchises offer a second which is superior to the first, The Alien, and Halloween series are among them, and so is Phantasm. As for Phantasm III, I have yet to find out, but I'm eager.

The original Phantasm had such wonderful ambiance and mystery. Like many 70s horror flicks, it looked and felt like some creepy, unfinished documentary. No sequel could recapture this special eeriness. And this one doesn't. Still, Phantasm II does maintain some nice attention to mood, even as it pumps up the action 80s style. This film features James LeGros as Mike and thank God that it does. I have nothing against A. Michael Baldwin and really loved him in the original. Still, LeGros brings a professional approach to the production that serves this film well. His strong A-list talent compensates for Reggie Bannister's hammy amateurism. Bannister is fine in small doses. He was fine in the original. But each Phantasm seems to give him yet more screen time. This is dangerous because Bannister is not really an actor he is simply a type. Fortunately, LeGros uses his considerable talent to keep Bannister in the moment and to prevent him from delivering every one of his lines as if it were a punch line. Too bad nobody could do this in Phantasm III, which through its undisciplined focus on Bannister's character becomes just one, long, awful, unfunny joke about unrequited horniness. Phantasm II, however, is still pretty good. -) "},{"Title":"A big improvement","Date":"27 March 2008","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" There's a point in Phantasm 2 where a mortuary assistant handles a bag of ashes labelled Sam Raimi. It's a moment of confirmation for the viewer, as in the time between Phantasm movies Raimi had (in Evil Dead 2) reached the perfect balance of humor and horror, and it's obvious Don Coscarelli was watching closely.The influence is everywhere here, from its love of chainsaws and shotguns to the slapstick gore and the deliberately hilarious machismo. It's not pitched to the perfection that Raimi achieved, but it does make for a very fun movie, and as such is much more enjoyable than the first Phantasm.The story is still barmy and the acting still dreadful, but this isn't ever trying to be anything more than an entertaining way to spend 90 minutes and it succeeds in that respect, as once it settles into it's rhythm there's a lot of laughs to be had, and them silver balls are still horribly threatening. The slicker visuals mean it's aged a lot better than the first film, and it's one of those rare things; a sequel that's an improvement on the original in every way.

Again, I was theater manager at the time, so I knew about this long before most people did. Me, being a big fan of the first one, I couldn't wait. As it turned out, my little theater never got it, so I had to wait for it to come out on video. But, I kept some promotional material that was sent, like a 'Phantasm II' t-shirt, and of course the one-sheet (poster). Sadly, all of these things were lost, or destroyed. I even kept the 35mm. preview, I don't know what ever happened to that!I liked how this one picked up ten years after the first. Michael was in an institution all of this time, because nobody believed his story of the tall man raiding grave yards. Somehow, even Reggie forgot about the events too. This time, Mike is telepathicly connected to Liz, a young lady who's town is being pillaged by the tall man, and she needs Mike's help. When Mike is released, he goes to the cemetery (I assume Morningside) and digs up some graves and tries to prove to Reggie something is wrong. Reggie, still unconvinced, takes Mike to his house, only to watch it explode, thanks to the tall man. At that point, Reggie must have gotten his memory back, because he, and Mike were now on a mission to destroy the tall man. They go from small town, to small town and find out their town is not the only one being destroyed by him.The hallmarks of 'Phantasm' are still here. The balls are still here, although more viscous, even the 1971 Plymouth 'Cuda. I guess Jody willed it to Reggie, but if you see III that idea goes out the window. I thought there some parts that were a little too graphic then they needed to be, but remember the 'Friday the 13th' series were still popular at the time, so maybe they felt they needed to compete with that. Over all I like 'II', even though Michael Baldwin didn't reprise his roll as 'Mike', and the ending was less of a mind-blower than the first. This could have been the last one of the series, but there are too many fans out there who wanted more, yes, I'm one of them, so there were more to come, sadly not to the big screen.

This time Michael's searching for a girl who's been dreaming about The Tall Man, who is getting bolder and emptying entire towns (not to mention the graveyards). It's hard to describe a plot which involves people chasing each other about, but this time our heroes have also got to contend with the Tall Man's assistants (all of whom meet very gory deaths).

The story, though odd, is easy to pick up on. Once we are introduced to everyone, it is easy to figure out what they represent, and what they have on their agendas. The story centers around two men (Reggie Bannister and James Legros) attempting to track down and kill The Tall Man played with sinister creepiness by Angus Scrimm. When you are name Angus Scrimm, its a pretty good bet you are going to end up as a horror movie actor. Angus Scrimm the Pediotrist just doesn't sound right. But this Tall Man and his minions travel from one small town to the next robbing graves and turning the corpses into evil dwarfs resembling Jawas from Star Wars. And in Phantasm II, The Tall man has apparently made the jump from not only harvesting the dead, to also preying on the living. Needless to say, he must be stopped.This is a gory, campy film that is fairly well-paced. The acting is as good as one could ask for, though the experience of the cast is fairly limited to this series itself, and other genre pics. Only James Legros really went on to do more high profile projects after this. And he seems to have peaked in the 1990s. The action is played out in a series of explosions, characters battling each other with hardware store equipment, and using mortuary devises to inflict painful death. The Tall man has quite a lot at his disposal. He has his dwarf army, creepy mortuary workers, gas mask-wearing grave diggers, and chrome spheres that seek out and suck the brains from the nearest person they find. But our heroes are also heavily armed, drive a fast car, and have a determination to see this thing through to the end.The only trouble is, this is just one of four parts to this series. Even though things seemed to be wrapped up nicely until the final frames, apparently this story goes on and on. And though I enjoyed this film, I'm still not compelled to seek out the other three. I got the point just fine with this one. The writer/director of this film has not done a lot else outside this series. Perhaps he has ideas and just can't get funding. Or maybe just no additional ideas. If you are a true fan of this series, more power to you. If not, and you still come across Phantasm II, give it a look.

It took almost ten years to come, but it finally did and it was nowhere near a letdown. It's a pretty solid sequel and expanded not only the world of the original, but the fanbase as well.Pros Nice performances from both the new and returning cast members. An updated and memorable score. Some really cool make-up and creature effects. More scary images and moments. We get to see more into the Tall Man's plan and process.

I'm no film student but even I can see the lighting, photography, editing etc is vastly improved. Maybe he had more money who knows but I'd rather believe that his 'art' had developed from the first feature. The main lead played by James Le Gros is a change to the original and subsequent character of 'Mike' played in the first and parts 3 & 4 by Michael Baldwin. Theres a lot of promise in part two, I especially liked Mike's esp link with his later love interest and hoped that this would be an interesting development in later sequels (disappointingly this wasnt to be) at least we had a glimpse in this feature to see Mike as a likeable hero with his trusty but horny sidekick Reggie, rather than the sulky introverted character later portrayed.

Not only is this a really good horror film in itself but it also helps the viewer to understand the first film a little better.Phantasm had a lot of good suspense and Phantasm II carries on the tradition while adding a lot of good action as well.

They either claim to be scary by having (this is kind of hard to explain here in text) a person in a scene back up, not being right in the center of the Point Of View of the camera, but off to the side...so the filmmakers will hope we won't see someone grab them from offscreen and that we'll be scared, which has been done about a billion times since the first horror movie ever came out (whatever it was), or they throw in a bunch of gore and claim that it's scary that way.  (Some people also don't know what scary is, like when a friend of mine once said she didn't like them scary movies, like Freddy Krueger and all...come on, Freddy wasn't scary, he was just cool!)Actually, I didn't think this movie was scary either, but creepy, as I kind of liken the atmosphere of this movie to Steven King's Children of the Corn short story, which I thought was really creepy due to a town being totally empty, for some reason...except for the weird children.  Well, it wasn't creepy onscreen, since an empty town with nothing going on made it...BORING.  Here the towns are empty...and so are all of the graves; they looked like they were freshly dug for the newly deceased to be placed into, but it was actually just the opposite (and by the way, was I the only one to notice that every SINGLE small town had absolutely HUGE graveyards?!).Granted, some of the script bites, I didn't think the new Michael could act (some people on here thought he could, but he just seemed to only have one facial expression and only said his lines with only one or two monotones...THAT'S acting?) and some of it didn't make any sense...and I don't mean in the ways as to why the Tall Man is compressing humans into the evil dwarf minions, what the spheres are, etc., but I'm talking about what that priest had to do with it and all; his scenes are confusing and unexplained and should've been left out or explained as to what exactly he was doing (or what he was hoping to accomplish).Some people have complained about how the atmosphere isn't the same as the first one, but I can't really comment on it, since I only saw the original about 15 years ago on tv, but rest assured, I WILL be re-renting it in the near future!  All I can say is that this sequel was pretty brightly lit--rather than making it dark so we can't see who or what is going to pop out from the shadows, hoping to scare us (oh PLEASE!)--yet it was still creepy.

One that horror movies rarely got back then. The first one though was still better, this one sort of picks up where that left off as there is some backtracking, but I actually liked the way the first one left off. It had a good spooky finish and this movie sort of ruins it. Angus Scrimm is good as the tall man and the guy who played Reggie is back as well. Jodie, however, is played by a different guy, though it doesn't detract to much from this one as he was a kid in the first so you don't really notice. However, when they switch back to the original kid in the next one it is a bit noticeable. Here we have Reggie and Jodie going after the tall man. He has basically wiped out both of their families so they now have nothing left to lose. They get themselves an arsenal that includes two shotguns secured together that for some reason would become popular. So popular in fact that they would return in the next movie even though it was clearly dropped and left behind in this one. The tall man has his weapons two as he has three spheres of doom here. In the next movie they would pretty much be the main focus, but here they are still just a weapon used by the tall man. He also has his dwarfs and his creepy morticians. This one is a bit more action oriented than the first and not as creepy, but it does work rather well and is entertaining.

A thrilling and scary opening segment has the dwarfs over running Reggie's (Banister) house as he barely has time to pull an unconscious Mike (LeGros) to safety. Mike and Reggie take to the road in search of hunting out the Tall Man (Scrimm) who has been robbing the dead and turning towns barren. Of course the Tall Man has his own plans as well. Mike has a psychic link to a girl named Liz (Irvine) who later connects with them. Coscarelli keeps the Phantasm world a strange one, by not always explaining the actions the movie, like the original plays like a bizarre nightmare and this helps in II as well. The bigger budget allowed for excellent and gory effects by mark Shostrom and Phantasm II does not disappoint in the gore department. It was fun seeing Bannister return as ice cream man Reggie in a expanded version of his character. This is a kick ass version of Reggie instead of the guitar playing hippie from the original. James LeGros as Mike is serviceable but Michael Baldwin was missed here. The ever Sinister Tall Man played brilliantly by Angus Scrimm is as menacing as ever and supplies most of the chills the movie has to offer. Credit is to be given to Coscarelli for not over using the Tall Man here. In order to please fans, many horror series feel the need to show more of the villain because they think this is what the fans want. By keeping the Tall man limited in screen time, he maintains the mystery and scary presence that made him so great in the original. Unlike the parody that Freddy Krueger became in the sequels, The Tall Man keeps his scary charm which helps the film considerably. Phantasm II is a worthy follow up to the now classic original and is a fun scary ride; just don't expect it all to make perfect sense.

The script was definitely there and I loved the road type feel that the movie provided. They brought the typical 80's feel and characters into this movie that we are used to seeing in horror films. However, the fact of not bringing the original Michael back for Part II is a huge let down. I suppose the producers wanted a more eye appealing male actor but I feel Mike Baldwin was terrific.

I've seen it several times, though upon writing this review after having watched it again, this most recent viewing marks the first time in about 8 years or so that I've seen it, and it's lost some of its sparkle.My main complaints concern several scenes of very stilted acting, particularly during the ret-con introduction. A new actor is playing Mike, and while the original actor wasn't an Oscar contender, his replacement is quite lackluster, though adequately naive. Reggie is back, thankfully, and now armed with a kick ass 4 barrel shotgun that is woefully underused. I also hated the unnecessary constant face close-ups that occurred several times. It gave it a bad-TV-pilot feel at times.This being said, I still enjoy the movie immensely, in spite of some of the obvious flaws of a low budget 80's production. A new sentinel sphere makes its grand entrance here, a golden ball of evil sporting some very nasty and effective hardware. I felt like the brain drilling scenes could have had more blood, but you can't have everything, I guess.Angus Scrimm is back(Boooooooooooy!) and he's great even though his speaking role is limited. The character of Alchemy is a rather silly and pointless addition to the cast, and she only shows up to reveal her small cup size(but, I can't really complain about that). And Liz has some weird mental connection with Mike that isn't really explained and no one really cares, anyway.This is my favorite of the series, followed by the original.

However, in keeping with the tradition of Alien and Terminator, this sequel is packed with action and makes for one of the quintessential 80s action/horror films.I agree that this film has its cheesy moments and some dubious scenes but these add to the slightly jokey feel of the film that allows the director to take a few liberties, a la Evil Dead II. The original Michael is replaced with James LeGros who does a better job in my opinion and Reggie Bannister is along for the ride once more, replete with a bag full of one liners (and a quad shotgun).Plot wise, this is much more of a road movie, interspersed with high action and all kinds of classic 80s scenes. There is enough gore to satisfy and a scene where a one armed guy meets his end is particularly memorable. The usual Phantasm twists and strangeness are not abandoned all together and the ending is particularly satisfying.All in all, whilst I appreciate and adore the original, I actually prefer watching this one.

Director Don Coscarelli had come to fame for creating Phantasm, an eerie, bizarre and nightmarish Horror classic back in 1979, and although this sequel is not nearly as suspenseful and atmospheric as its predecessor, it is an immensely entertaining flick that delivers stylish violence, morbid humor and non-stop action.- Some possible minor SPOILERS ahead. - Several years after the events from the first film, Mike Pearson, who has in the meanwhile grown up, is released from a mental hospital, where he has spent several years after trying to persuade people of the existence of the Tall Man, a supernatural corpse snatcher, who enslaves the dead. After his release, Mike reunites with his old friend Reggie, in order to hunt the Tall Man down...What I really liked about this sequel was the fact that the great, very cool character of Reggie (played by Reggie Bannister) plays a bigger role than in the first movie. James Le Gros replaced A. Michael Baldwin as Mike, the main character of the first film, and my opinion about this replacement is quite neutral. Baldwin delivered a good performance as the kid in the first film, but Le Gros is also decent in the role. Angus Scrimm is still excellent in his role as the Tall Man, who does not yet loose his creepiness (which, unfortunately, he does in parts 3 and 4). There is more cheese in the sequel, and i definitely has its flaws, but although it is not even nearly a classic like the 1979 original, Phantasm II is definitely a very cool flick that every lover of gory fun should appreciate.

The movie is great up until the end, the plot basically involves Reggie and Mike hunting the Tall Man the entire time. There are not many characters in this one, so not a high body count, but you really feel for these characters. The pace is continuous and non-stop which is good...nothing ever drags. I would've liked some more Evil Dead scenes; shotgunning evil dwarfs and killing other henchmen of the Tall Man. Unfortunately, though the quad-shotgun makes many appearances since we only see one blast emit from it's legendary barrels, and then Reggie discards it.That was a disappointment since I wanted to see more of a hunt/kill evil baddies flick than a stalk and kill at the end flick. Minor complaints if anything though. The ending of this one I caught when I was just a kid and it gave me nightmares for some time. Now, watching it again, I was thoroughly disappointed...not a happy one, but apparently, Phantasm III explains everything...I haven't seen it yet, but I will given that this film entertained me almost the entire time.

The first, and perhaps most important element helping this one along, is the fact that this is one of the goriest entries in any film genre, which is impressive to see. From the new gold spheres that bore basketball-sized holes into the body and emerge in full display oozing streams of blood from the wound, to having faces melt off and being riddled with bullets and shotgun blasts tearing massive chunks from the body, amid more than what's mentioned, this one has more than enough to really satisfy gorehounds. As well, there's also just a relentless assault of action in this, which not only makes the film incredibly enjoyable but also continues to the next scene and builds on it logically, from the freeway chase that's normally not present in horror films to the multitude of shoot-outs and explosions and the confrontations in the mausoleums which makes for some creepy action as well. That this one manages to mix together action and suspense together beautifully, including the opening which carries on from the original and answers its' questions is another rather nice quality, and altogether with the impressive special effects, outstanding locations and nary a flaw at all, this proves to be one of the greatest in the series.Rated R Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Nudity, and a full-on sex scene.

For one Universal wanted established working actors to portray the leads. After much wrangling they finally agree to give Coscarelli the choice between replacing Michael Baldwin or Reggie Bannister. Coscarelli chose to replace Baldwin with James Le Gros, which as it turned out was a wise choice. Universal also made it clear that unlike the original, there would be no surreal dream like plot, and the story would be filmed in a linear fashion answering as many questions as possible. This stipulation technically should have killed this film since much of the original was based around the separation of reality and fantasy.Somehow despite these restrictions, Don Coscarelli took these lemons and made some damn fine lemonade.Phantasm II is one of the best paced, unrelenting horror rides ever made. Many hardcore Phans consider this to be better than the original, and while I am not in their number I can understand their arguments. It like the original Phantasm deserves its place among the pantheon of great horror such as Dawn of the Dead, Halloween, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre.Without giving too much of the plot away, Mike and Reggie set out after the Tall Man (played wonderfully by Angus Scrimm) to take revenge for the murder of their loved ones. Along the way they kick maximum ass. That's all you need to know. Just watch it.Kudos especially to Reggie Bannister, who went from sidekick in the original, to horror movie heavyweight with this role. He is one of the best characters in the horror genre since Evil Dead's Ash for sure, and is a great underrated actor. Hopefully the upcoming release of this movie on Region 1 DVD will expose more people to this under-appreciated actor.

(Likewise, I prefer Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO to the sequel, though the sequel is a more-than-welcome companion piece to the original.) PHANTASM II, a la PSYCHO II, opens with a visit to- and release from- a psychiatric institution. And, like THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, gives us a protagonist who has matured (to a degree). While there's not much of the music of the spheres that helped make the original so memorable, there are those brain-burrowing orbs and Reggie Bannister's 2X2, four-barrel sawed-off shotgun and a chainsaw duel to rival Dennis Hopper's go at Bubba Sawyer in THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE II.

Mike (this time played by James LeGros) is released from the Morningside Psychiatric Hospital, and was lead to believe that all the events of the first film were in his imagination, and that his brother, Jody, was killed in a car accident. But Mike knows what really happened, and begins desperately searching for The Tall Man (Angus Scrimm), a ghoulish man from another dimension who enslaves the dead. With the help of Reggie (Reggie Bannister), Mike begins a long road-trip, going by small towns that have been 'killed' by the Tall Man and his army of ghoulish dwarfs and flying spheres, as they search for the town he is currently residing. They find him in the small town of Perigord, Oregon, and begin a relentless battle of good versus evil.An excellent, thought-provoking installment into the utterly bizarre Phantasm series, Phantasm II is an extremely fun and action-filled sequel that comes close to being just as good as it's predecessor. Don Coscarelli resumes his job again as writer and director, and has done a great job with continuing the story. While this film does take the story in a bit of a different direction, the storytelling itself and the continuation is top-notch. It's a different film from the original, and if you have seen the original, you are mostly familiar with the Tall Man and his ways, so the bizarre nature of this sequel isn't quite as bizarre. Nonetheless, Coscarelli has packed in plenty of fun into this movie. There are some twists to the plot also, including a psychic connection to a girl who knows about the Tall Man as well, and the fact that the Tall Man goes from town to town doing the same thing - it didn't just happen at Morningside.Everything that made the original movie so scary is brought back for the sequel - those flying lethal silver spheres, the marble-halled mortuary, the eerie small town setting, the dwarf creatures, and the Tall Man himself. Sadly, the atmosphere is a bit different and the narrative isn't so surreal in this film, but this movie still manages to display some haunting and nightmarish visuals, and the overall feel is still very foreboding and truly scary. There are plenty of scary sequences and some great shocks, including some startling zombie make-up and some really excellent special effects. Some nice camera tricks abound as well, including point-of-view shots of the silver spheres during their deadly attacks - we get a few more of the blood-draining little beasts at their work, and these scenes are disturbing to say the least. The only letdown was the absence of Michael Baldwin as the lead character, but James LeGros fills his shoes well. Reggie Bannister is excellent again as the likable Reggie, and Angus Scrimm is terrifying as ever as the Tall Man. Overall, Phantasm II is a stunning sequel to a truly original and amazing movie. It's an immensely eerie and very compelling continuation of a bizarre story, packed with plenty of suspense, atmosphere, scares, and some well-executed action sequences. It's a bit different from the original movie, but it's an excellent sequel in it's own terms, and still manages to give me the creeps, just as the first film did. Phantasm fans (or, 'Phans') won't be disappointed with this nightmarish, thrilling installment. I'd say it's one of the best horror sequels out there. 9/10.

Essentially, it's to its predecessor what Aliens was to Alien a genre crossing movie that puts the accent on action, and lots of it. It's exciting, gleefully macabre stuff that has a real fun factor going for it.It gets down to business fairly quickly, picking up where the first film left off and then fast forwarding to several years later when Mike (James Le Gros) is being released from a mental hospital. Mike is still determined to battle the nefarious Tall Man (Angus Scrimm) and convinces his good buddy Reg (Reggie Bannister) to join him in the fight. They track their nemesis down to a small Oregon town (named Perigrod) and find that he's still up to his old tricks.One has to take some bad with the good considering that this was a major studio sequel to an independently made classic. The budget allows for greater scope and super-duper effects, but Universal flexed its muscle and made sure that this was a more linear and less surreal movie than Phantasm one. They also made Bannister and A. Michael Baldwin audition for their old roles, and in the end would only let Coscarelli keep one of them. It was also their idea to give Mike a love interest, a sweet gal named Liz (Paula Irvine) to whom Mike is psychically connected.What's truly a delight here is seeing the affable Bannister ascend to the role of a badass hero. He and Le Gros make a good team as they vow to fight evil. Their impromptu shopping trip calls to mind a similar sequence with Arnold in the action favourite Commando. Scrimm gets barely any screen time, but in this case a little does go a long way; we always look forward to his next appearance. Samantha Phillips adds some sex appeal as hitchhiker Alchemy, busy character actor Kenneth Tigar does alright as a frightened priest, and Stacey Travis (Hardware) has a brief part as Liz's sister. The atmosphere is still good (one of the most successful aspects to the film is seeing the damage wrought by the Tall Man and his minions, as Mike and Reg pass through towns that have become forlorn wastelands) and Daryn Okadas' cinematography is excellent. The infamous spheres are back and the makeup effects and gore (supervised by Mark Shostrom) are fun to watch - and not as unrelenting as Leonard Maltins' paperback review would have you believe. The music by Fred Myrow and Christopher L.

Phantasm II picks up where the first Phantasm left off Reggie and Mike being terrorized by the Tall Man. This film opens with an exciting exit from that house and Reggie and Mike vow to take care of the Tall Man and fight his evil ways. Mike, throughout, has a mental connection with Liz - they both seem to have extra powers that attract the Tall man to them. Well Reggie and Mike go to Oregon on their journey to stop the Tall man, hook up with Liz, and , well, you guessed it battle Angus Scrimm and his legions of brown hooded dwarfs, and two young morticians with penchants for embalming and burning. This is filled with action sequences and all the stuff in it that made the first Phantasm so popular the metal spheres with the cutting blades(doing some terrifically bloody work here), the passage to the netherworld where the dwarfs work tirelessly for the Tall Man, and Scrimm of course with a few choice lines and that foreboding appearance. We also get chainsaws, embalming fluid by the quarts, and some real bloody scenes. Scrimm is great and I don't know that I have ever seen an actor like him milk a role for an entire career as well as he. He definitely has that look. The male leads are played by James LeGros as Mike(he is acceptable) and Reggie Bannister as Reg is back again. I love this character as Reggie plays everyman. He is the atypical horror hero. Bannister is a lot of fun in the film. Paula Irvine is luscious Liz, a beautiful blonde trying to escape the clutches of the Tall Man and leggy Samantha Phillips is along for the ride(actually she gets several rides in this film). Coscarelli paces the film wonderfully. The special effects are quite good for their time and some of the scenes are playing for laughs and genuine frights. The cemetery, the morgue, the casket room, and the crematorium were all done up with his eerie flair and make Phantasm II a much stronger horror film. While perhaps not as on edge-of-your-seat as the original, this sequel is darn close. I had a lot of fun watching it and look forward to seeing the remainder of the films in the Phantasm cycle.

Mike (A. Michael Baldwin in the beginning) narrowly escapes capture by The Tall Man (Angus Scrimm) and his army of zombified dwarfs thanks to the efforts of his friend Reggie (Reggie Bannister). After a narrow escape, Mike is placed in a psychiatric hospital and a young girl named Liz (Paula Irvine) does a voice-over stating she is involved with The Tall Man as well. Eight years later, Mike (now portrayed by James LeGros) is let out and he and Reggie go on a hunt in search of The Tall Man, following his trail of victimized towns that have been wiped out and turned into his followers while in search of Liz additionally, who is telepathically connected to Mike through their association with The Tall Man and become romantically involved. Together Mike, Reggie, and Liz fight together in effort to put an end to The Tall Man's mysterious evil once and for all.The Phantasm movies arn't exactly very well known known which is too bad because they are great films. The second installment of the series can easily be considered it's highest point. The first film was a great movie and a definite classic but this one just kind of expands on everything. Phantasm II has a completely different mood from the atmospheric original; this one is more of an action/adventure film in a fantasy/horror setting. This is not a bad thing really since those looking for a thrill have come to the right place and for horror fans, the film is still pretty creepy. Thanks to a much bigger budget than the first, there are loads of great special effects in this film, which is essential for a film with as many fantasy elements as this. I'm amazed the original got as far as it did with such a small budget, especially since that one was more focused on fantasy elements. The famous silver spheres of which the series is famous for make a return in this film, only this time there are a bunch of them plus a large gold sphere in this one as opposed to the single sphere in the original. Charicter's in this film are great as they are very likable and and they actor's who play them are great; James LeGros does a great portrayal of Mike despite the fact that he isn't Michael Baldwin, Reggie Bannister is bad-ass as usual, Paula Irvine is terrific as Liz (it's a shame she stopped acting), Samantha Phillips is good as mysterious hitch-hiker Alchemy, and Angus Scrimm of course gives another great performance as The Tall Man.There isn't really much about this film to complain about. I liked it a lot more than I should have but still. It has an interesting plot, great characters, a mysterious villain, a bald guy with a quad-barrel shotgun who used to sell ice cream, and flying spheres that drill people's brains out ) It's definitely not a film everyone will like but it's definitely one to check out. I loved it and many other reviewers did too. Those concerned about content the film had a bit of blood but isn't terribly gory; most of the violence more or less comes from the spheres who only kill two people. There is also a brief sex scene with a little nudity but other than swearing thats about it. The film is written and directed by Don Coscarelli, who wrote and directed the other three films in the series (and an upcoming fifth and final one) as well as classics like The Beastmaster and Bubba Ho-Tep.The BreakdownPROS Solid acting, likable and interesting character's, attractive women (Paula Irvine and Samantha Phillips), a revamped version of the already awesome Phantasm theme (one of the best tunes ever; ranks with Terminator and Halloween), great FX and special effects, a few good quotes, great action, and the plot is pretty good as well.CONS As of June 7, 2007 there are no plans to release this on DVD (which is flat out pathetic), kind of confusing at times, and as the 5.8 rating suggests it's not a film for everyone. There really isn't much that is bad to say about this in the end.OVERALL Phantasm II is not only a worthy sequel to a classic original but ranks with films like Terminator 2 and Aliens as a rare sequel that manages to be just as good as the original. It is also very different in style and the film's score is awesome. Should you have interest in seeing this, be sure to see the original Phantasm first since this one begins right as that one ends. I highly recommend this one, I love this series and this film is incredible. It's highly recommended as at least a rent to watch if you have nothing better to do, are in the mood for a movie, or whatever. Phantasm II is a thrilling action/horror flick and I recommend the whole franchise as well. Only if you really liked the character of Liz like I did the way Coscarelli treats her in the beginning of the next installment will be a huge disappointment.Rated R Grisly Fantasy Violence, Language, and some Sexual Content Runtime 1 hour and 36 minutes Score 10/10 "},{"Title":"a great follow up just as good as the original WARNING!!!!!!!

Taking place several years after the original, the plot features the survivors of the original tracking down the evil Tall Man.The film often confuses dreams and reality so that it is often hard to tell what is real and what is not.  As a result, it is often hard to feel that the characters are in any danger.  In fact, writer/director Don Coscarelli didn't really seem to care much about having a plot at all.  The character development is almost zero and most of the film seems to be a re-hash of the original.  The special effects are pretty bad too.On the plus side, Angus Scrimm is quite good as the villainous Tall Man, and the infamous flying metal spheres , that kill people by spiking their brains make a welcome re-appearance.The original Phantasm was weird and fun, but this is neither weird enough, scary enough or gory enough.

After years of genre filmmakers scrambling for cash to get their productions up and running, many studios were looking to cash in on the terror craze. Universal chose to throw money at Phantasm and give it the opportunity to go bigger and better.Phantasm II picks up immediately after the first film. Mike convinces Reggie they must track down the Tall Man before he and his minions kill everyone in their path. The two go on the road, traveling one dead town to the next while following a trail of unearthed graveyards.Director Don Coscarelli did what any filmmaker would do in his position. He took the studio's money and ran with it. Phantasm II is a horror spectacle to be seen. He ups the ante on everything. There are huge explosions, more mechanical flying balls, and things get visually existential to the point of confusion. It's not a bad type of disorientation. It reminds me of a terrifying version of 2001 A Space Odyssey and other films that don't fully explain what's going on.Phantasm II will make viewers fear not only how they might die, but what could happen to their bodies and souls after wards. What could be worse than being conscience in your body but not have control over yourself? Thankfully, my beliefs give me a level of comfort the Tall Man would tell you is foolish and false.Phantasm II serves as a nostalgic look back at a special era in the history of horror films. It was a time where practical effects still ruled and green screen didn't dominate every frame. Great gore and a truly creepy storyline make this a welcome addition to any genre fan's home movie collection.

This pretty much describes Phantasm 1 and 2 except the Phantasm series never had concrete rules to play by so there kinda-sorta might be an enigma still out there . . . but, well, nevermind. Okay, sure the 'let's take a neverending road trip to fight evil' plot is silly, unbelievable, borderline stupid, but considering the events of Phantasm and the nature of the Phantasm universe . . . is it really that hard to believe within its own world where 'open-ended' is an understatement? Wait-wait-wait, before you answer that, let's consider the logistics and physics of a quad-barrel shotgun - something that would probably dislocate a normal person's shoulder . . . or a chainsaw duel! Alien Jawa grave robbers, anyone? Okay, now that we've established that, is anything hard to believe within this screwed up world? This is the cinematic Far Side gone horribly wrong. Sure it's absurd, but the key is that Coscarelli is consistently absurd and doesn't really try to pass any of it off as real and why am I saying this when the first film clearly illustrates this? Anyway, Don Coscarelli returns with more budget to play with, and admirably actually delivers something with it. We still have 1970s horror character naivety and over the top acting, but ya know, I never complained about those. It comes with the genre, and it's part of the Phantasm experience. My real complaints on the technical end are amended - improved and more elaborate special effects, better sets, and a score performed on instruments worthy of the notes played.

The mausoleum (Perigord) The Tall Man inhabits in this film is totally dark, dank and gray, as opposed to the bright, pristine marble of the original Morningside. The story-telling is okay, however this one really has nothing on the original. Yes, it does tell us what happened to Mike after being pulled through the closet door by a dwarf (he got put into a mental hospital for ten years? Huh? Excuse me?

Okay, extend your disblief further - Reg has an entire family who the Tall Man manages to blow up (?) which supposedly co-incides with what happened to Mike's original home (?). Oh, and Mike now has a telepathic link to this girl named Liz who just pops up out of nowhere and really has no significance other than to be a short-lived love interest. Alchemy (Kimmy for short) is some hitch-hiking chick that Reg manages to get with, but turns out she works for the Tall Man (sort of like the Lady In Lavender, only far less interesting, too talkative and with no mystery about her).James LeGross portrays a totally different Mike than Michael Baldwin (whether that's a good thing or not I'll let you decide).

It takes a step that many horror/sci-fi movies take that I like to call the Electric Boog-a-loo Gambit. In this manoeuver, the director juices up the story with some more hardcore gun-action and strapping-down-for-battle sequences, making the overall effect one of moving the film from the horror/sci-fi genre to the horror-action/sci-fi-action genre. Take a look at the Alien-to-Aliens evolution for a successful, well-executed example.As for Phantasm II Electric Boog-a-Loo? Not quite so successful. Granted, I was genuinely interested in the notion that the Tall Man was actually sweeping across the West Coast and sucking towns dry, leaving a bloody swath of destruction behind him. Also, after seeing the way A. Michael Baldwin grew up in the last two movies of this series, I was relieved that they put only mildly-to-moderately-unattractive James TheFat in as an older Michael for at least this film. It's even kind of engaging to have Reggie return as the Ice Cream Rambo to hit the road with Michael. And it's interesting to insert a telepathic love story with a young girl watching her town succumb to the Tall Man's Evil.But beyond that, it's just all of the bizarre and unusual characters from the first film-The Tall Man, the flying spheres(including a groovy gold lamee one that has more accessories than a Robotech action figure)the dwarves, and the tuning forks, all recast as action villains. There's no tension, and no sense of the horror over the Tall Man's activities, which were made even more frightening in the first film in that his motivations were not entirely explained. Way to bland it out, guys.Some other points-This movie begins what becomes a disturbing trend in the remaining films it begins by completely throwing away what you saw in the end of the previous film. Now we're supposed to believe that No, Michael was not just dreaming that his brother died and was killed by the Tall Man and then sees him in his mirror and gets sucked into the mirror a-la-just-about-every horror-movie-ever-made. No-what really happened is Reggie puts down his skanky guitar, goes upstairs, and sees that Mikey was telling the truth, after all. Then his house blows up, and then they put Mikey away, where he becomes James TheFat, and voila! Soon after, the Ergonomic Duo is on the road. What? At least try and stick to some semblance of a story. By this logic, did any of the original movie take place at all? Reggie just seems p***ed that a bunch of Roid-Rage Jawas forced him to blow up his house. I don't know. Maybe I read it wrong. Send me a message if you can explain it.-Who is that priest? Jesus, what point does he serve except to allow Angus Scrimm the opportunity to hang him by his rosary and say, You think when you die, you go to heaven? You come to us! I stopped liking whoever this actor was after he made several appearances on the Barney Miller show as Man Claiming to Be Possessed, Man Claiming to Be a Werewolf, and Man Claiming to Be Chased By A Poltergeist, not necessarily in that order.-The obligatory getting-strapped-at-the-hardware-store scene. Come on. A four barrelled shotgun? Even Charlton Heston would say, Geez, Reg, I don't know if that much firepower is safe...can you handle the recoil? This goes in with the Boog-a-Loo Gambit that I mentionedGuys must have at least a three minute scene where they construct and fasten weapons to their bodies. Then all said weapons must be taken away from heroes so that they are forced to kill bad guy by embalming with acid, hyrdochloric or other. This, I am fairly sure, is a direct quote from the SAG guidelines on S***e Horror Films.-Finally, the reason I sat down and watched all these movies in the first place The Last Line. NO, IT'S NOT! was just as ridiculous as I remember, and while it's cute to have it end precisely the same way the first did-with someone getting pulled through a window-it's just tired and unsatisfactory at the end of the day.So it begins. From here on out, it's just one big slippery slope, and Phantasm II Electric Boog-a-Loo is just the first greasy step.I sat down and watched all four Phantasm films the other day, just because I'm an idiot.

Mike tricks his shrink into releasing him, telling him that his dreams about The Tall Man have stopped, and he is released from the institution he's been in for years. He meets up with Reggie, Reggie still has no reason to believe Mike's dreams about the Tall Man, but then - surprise of surprises - Reggie's house blows up, just as it did in Mike's dreams. But this time, instead of killing The Tall Man's dwarfs, it kills Reggie's family, proving to Mike and Reggie that Mike's dreams are real. (At the funeral of Reggie's family, Reggie says to Mike, You knew, before it happened) The two of them leave behind what little they have left and set out to find and kill the Tall Man, as well as find a psychic girl named Liz, who's been having the same dreams as Mike for years.Unfortunately, from then on it degenerates into a gory (and heavilly edited) rehash of the first film we find out the cemetery is real, Liz is real, the cannibal midgets are real, and The Tall Man is real- only this time Mike and Reggie have Rambo-type weaponry four-barrel shotguns, flamethrowers etc. to fight the Tall Man with, and zero sense of style or humour this time around. The movie is slow going, and ceases to make sense several times because of the heavy editing, and the end shot (being pulled through the glass) goes so far as to rip off the first Phantasm! Very disappointing. The work print of this film is, at times, an improvement over the theatrical and video prints, with less editing to confuse the viewers, but the film did not yet have the funeral of Reggie's family, explaining the plot a bit more thoroughly. Neither print, however, has the same style or sense of humour as the original, just 80s gore and excessive violence. And really, Reggie is now a heavilly armed ex-ice cream vendor?

The protagonist is 19 year-old Mike (James Le Gros), who's released from a metal hospital and immediately teams-up with middle-aged Reg (Reggie Bannister) to hunt down the mysterious Tall Man (Angus Scrimm), an otherworldly mortician who plunders whole graveyards, as well as the sleeping, with the help of hideous little gnomes and baseball-sized spheres that can saw into people (?). What does the Tall Man do with the bodies and people? I think he turns them into more diabolical gnomes. Who knows? Paula Irvine and Samantha Phillips are also on hand as Liz and Alchemy.While this is a unique, colorful and fairly entertaining horror flick, it's hampered by an incoherent story, cardboard characters, a low-budget cartoony delivery and a dubious cast. One example of the cardboard characters is Reggie, whose house and family are blown to bits and yet he gets over it immediately with zero signs of grief. Despite this, it's hard not to like Reggie and root for him & Mike as they go on the road in search of the Tall Man; they're unlikely, but amiable protagonists.Really, everything about this film is bizarre; I've never seen anything else like it. Even the casting's bizarre. For instance, the villain is played by some tall, skinny old guy who lacks the charisma of, say, Christopher Lee to be fully effective. It's the same thing with the girls. They're not bad, but they're hardly Friday Girl material, but &#x96; then again &#x96; this may not be a bad thing because they reflect real people rather than actors with Hollywood good-looks.As noted above, the story &#x96; or the way it's told &#x96; is nigh incomprehensible. There's a lot of action and things to perk your attention every five minutes, but everything's just so muddled, gaudy and comic booky, which may be part of the movie's charm.

And usually I'll carry through to the end of the series, watching each to see how the mysteries created will be explained. Even when the Saw series nosedived, I stuck it through to the hopeful last one Saw VII.It's strongly doubtful the same will happen with the drug-induced trip of this franchise. Phantasm II closed the deal for me. I just don't care how this pans out (in parts III and IV.)Originally, I remember seeing this as a double feature back in 1988 along side Poltergeist III. Ahhh, remember when they had double features at the theatre and you could enjoy an all-afternoon worth of horror, or genre of your choice? Despite the fact I had not seen either of the mentioned series' previous entries up to this point, of the two movies, I actually liked Phantasm II less.Finally, finally, I saw Phantasm (the original) a few days ago (2/16/11) and though I was greatly disappointed, nothing prepared me for the (actual) horror of the follow-up.Yeah, I get they realized the original was camp &#x96; or was that crap? &#x96; and they poked fun throughout this feature&#x85;ha ha ha on the Mr. Sam Raimi. But it was so beyond corny &#x96; hear that EXPLOSION sound-effect? &#x96; it turned out more like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part 2 than Scream 2. And though I'll admit it was a heck of a lot more coherent than the original &#x96; the basic story did go from A to B &#x96; but that didn't raise it above any typical direct-to-video crud that should've been just that.Our Phantasmbuster heroes Mike (replaced actor, James LeGros) and Ice-Cream-Menace Reggie (Bannister) vow to rid the world of the Tall Man (Scrimm) and his balls, well, evil killin' & drillin' spheres. So, they go from destroyed town to ghost town with the consistent feeling they're near thanks to Mike's dreams. Oh, and they're equally wet dreams due to a girl, Liz (Irvine), he's seeing parallel to the Tall Man.Again, I get the campiness of the feature, and their desire to give the audience what they wanted to see bad dudes with bad weapons taking on the devil (of sorts.) But, since it was revealed in part I that these are rejuvenating and teleporting aliens, using the guns and chainsaws against The Tall Man would be as effective as sending soldiers armed with sling-shots to battle Godzilla.But, that's the mentality of the low-budget fare. And speaking of which, it's sad they reported this to be biggest budget of the series $3 million. Which is ten times the original's. It probably helped they used the same explosion sound-effect whenever any one of the fifty structures exploded.I guess I'm taking this mess too seriously. At least one positive came out of it I no longer want to see any more of the Phantasm series. They could even promise to give the secrets of the killer balls, er, spheres. They did this time and we're left with an empty promise and more of the same delusional ideologies from the first feature.Unless you're a true phan of the phirst one, SKIP IT.

Their efforts are proving hard as he manages to slip away ever single time, leaving very little behind except for the miniature bodies he leaves behind. While on the road, Mike begins having psychic dreams about a young woman named Liz (Paula Irvine), who he has never met before. Desperate to meet her, Mike presses Reggie to continue on, and together they continue searching for the Tall Man. They find him at a cemetery in Oregon, where they also find Liz, who is worried about her grandparents (Rubin Kushner) (Ruth Engel), who take care of her. Mike and Reggie get her to safety, retool with some new firepower, and invade the cemetery for another showdown with the Tall Man.The Good News Man, is this one gory. This is easily the goriest of the whole series. With faces melting off and blood shooting from people's heads and tons of other bloodletting, this is a gore hound's dream. Not too many of them will be disappointed by this movie, as it has different kinds of gore, but thankfully, none of it is done off-screen. That makes the gore that much more realistic, as you get a chance to see it. Suspense is also way off the charts, with many scenes being nerve-rattling and unsettling. The best example of this is the opening scene, which plays off the ending of the first one in great detail and imagination. Those left confused at the end of part one has their questions answered here in a great scene that is pretty terrifying, a bit unsettling, and very logically done. As usual, the ending is very creepy and again leaves the way for a part three to be done, with that part done in part three done very logically. In contrast to the other films, this one has some great means of fighting the Tall Man. Reggie quadruple-barreled shotgun is as much of a cult classic icon as the film itself. True, it shoots off only one shot, but its effect is still impressive. Mike also has a great piece of firepower with his flamethrower, but it isn't as impressive as Reggie's gun. For me, though, the best thing about the movie is its high action. There are a lot of really great action scenes in here. The freeway chase is a real highlight, as normally horror movies don't have a car chase. The two shootouts are nicely handled, and the many explosions are also very impressive to see and hear. I also have to comment that the actors have done a great job with this movie. Despite the easy tendency to overact and basically be a jerk or a smart-aleck due to the way the movie plays out, the fact that they aren't is very commendable. Imagination is way up high, as you are constantly surprised and scared by what happens next. This isn't a very long movie, yet it still doesn't seem as long as it does. Watching it doesn't seem like it takes forever, and that is a great compliment to a film, where it is so enjoyable that the movie doesn't seem to end fast enough.The Bad News There is nothing bad about this movie.The Final Verdict This movie has something for everybody. Whether you are a horror fan, a gore hound, a 'Phantasm' fan, or any kind of movie fan at all, you should find this movie.

I've read about it, heard about it, seen clips from it, been lectured to on how important of a film it was, admonished for having a taste for similar period fare but always managing to miss it, and at this point have no excuse to not get a stupid DVD and just watch it. So, I'll pass. I never watch those Dude, you gotta see this movie movies, because frankly I don't care. If I did I would have sought it out. I have nothing against the franchise, know that others have really enjoyed it & speak highly of the favors it offers, and that's good enough for me.But I have seen PHANTASM II, and now own a DVD release with the infamous 'work print' version containing all of the explicit gore removed from the theatrical release to avoid an X rating. Why anyone would want to rate PHANTASM II an X when there is good old fashioned filth like CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, Emanuelle in America, HOUSE BY THE EDGE OF THE PARK and SNUFF slinking around escapes me, but to each his own. I think the MPAA was reacting to the tone of PHANTASM II more than it's actual content. The film has an enjoyably nihilistic yet decidedly juvenile and irreverent air to it where anything is game, nothing is sacred, and the more ironic the death & mutilation scenes the better for it's target demographic of 14 year old potheads who never grew up. Take the scene where one of the evil mortuary attendants has to hack off his own hand to avoid getting one of those flying metal balls in the face. It's almost like a sick homage to MAD MAX Can he hack his hand off in time??I first saw this film, or rather parts of it, on cable at a party in college where everyone was tripping and got bad karma from the film. I can see why. I can also see why they kept saying Let's switch back to that PHANTASM II again and see what's happening the movie is like a train wreck. You can't help but want to take a peek, have it push you over the edge, turn away, then peek back again. The thing I remember being impressed by -- and still am -- is the sheer cinematic nature of the film. It's completely phony or fake, existing only as a screen treatment of some warped, sadistic horror effects aficionado's favorite scenes from the history of horror strung into one cacophonous 100 odd minute comic strip, with no bearing on or relation to our everyday reality. Individual frames may stick out but the cohesive whole of the thing is only known to those who read along, and again as stated, I don't care.Is it fair to judge a franchise film when you come in halfway through the series after missing the setup? Of course not That would be like judging Abbey Road based only on side two. So by refusing to play along with the franchise formula I look at this installment as an outsider, with no precept of what comes before the gimmick ending/beginning or what happens after the actual ending of the film. I judge it only on what we see here and it's impressive if tasteless stuff, propelled by a sort of kinetic frenzy to want to see whatever could be dreamed up and executed on film, which can often result in pretty interesting movies. I could care less about Mike, Reggie, Liz and their bond of weirdness, though Samantha Phillips' Alchemy can ride herd on me anytime she likes, and yeah, of course the Quad Double Shotgun rulez. But I could care less if James LeGros (who became red-hot the following year with the *STILL* annoyingly trendy DRUGSTORE COWBOY) isn't the real Mike or, for that matter, if this is any good, better or worse than the other installments from the series, which I have no urge to & probably never will see. It is what it is, and what PHANTASM II is can best be termed as gnarly, gory, hyper kinetic fun, and again, that's good enough for me.I've sat through this DVD's theatrical print and the work print now three times each and have no idea what the story is about. It doesn't involve me enough to want to know, though the parade of carnage, explosions and flying limbs is about as impressive as any I have seen. Just what it all means eludes me, and I can live with that PHANTASM II on it's own without the rest of the series to explain it is like a distended nightmare one is walking into after it has started & leaving before it ends -- like a good party -- with a ghoulish sense of humor and an interesting release history to banter on about. It's a great horror movie for people who have limited attention spans or may possibly be drunk (or both), and while I will still agree with my fellow party goers that this is probably a bad trip, I honestly don't know why anyone who is tripping would set out to watch it. That's what THE YELLOW SUBMARINE was for, and if my friends were too stupid to get that point twenty years ago it's too late now.6/10 "}{"Title":"Another Sequel to a Terrible Horror Film?

Sometimes the actors seem too embarrassed to finish their sentences, such as when Reggie sees his girlfriend pull up in a car right after narrowly escaping certain doom, and whispers, Okay, everybody, get in the car, Alchemy is here... and the words sort of trail off amidst the action. Or how about when the two main characters are at a graveyard, dressed in black and wearing ridiculously silly Men in Black sunglasses. I'm sorry, Reggie, Mike says in regards to those who have died. Then Reggie puckers up his lips into a grimace and says, Let's go. We've got stuff to do. Watch his face when he says this. He has to keep from laughing.Then there's a classic scene where Reggie escapes from a car explosion triggered by the villain, gets to his feet, stares at Mike and says, Let's kick some ass. I nearly fell on the floor laughing. Yep, it's that bad. It doesn't sound very terrible, but with the direction and music overlapping the infamous actors, it's just about horrendous enough that I will cherish it forever. This is the type of scene I wish I could record and label as One of the Worst Scenes Ever, then tuck away in my video collection whenever I'm in need of a good laugh. This is Mystery Science Theater 3000 material. I came up with an abundance of jokes just watching Phantasm II, and if there's ever a sequel to MST3K, let's hope they pick this to spoof.From beginning to end it's a huge mess and an affront to all viewers.The original Phantasm was released in 1979, filmed on a low budget and starring a kid named A. Michael Baldwin. So with nine years to get ready for a sequel, one would think that the director -- Don Coscarelli -- might try to improve the visual effects, screenplay, story, etc. Nope. This movie has horrendous visuals; when a girl is thrown across a room, we can see the dummy attached to strings on a small miniature. It's something I'd expect a film student to construct, not a mainstream director (and especially not in a sequel). Terminator 2 this is not.The movie's villain, The Tall Man (Angus Scrimm), isn't scary or witty or mysterious or any of the qualities that usually describe a good villain. He walks around with a weak presence, as if he's yet another character on-screen. He's supposed to be the unattainable to these characters who seek vengeance, but keeping him hidden in shadows would have been a much more effective technique. One of the biggest rules of the horror genre is that you cannot portray your villains as typical characters. Candyman wasn't a great movie, but it was freaky because of how little it managed to show. The Candyman himself was sort of mystical and strange; we never really got a good look at him.The Tall Man's agenda is to rob graves. In the first movie he got caught up in the life of Mike (now played by James Le Gros), who found out that The Tall Man had the ability to craft super-cool spherical objects that fly around a room with heat-vision, then find their targets and bore drills into your brain, spurting blood out a hole on the opposite side. The same happens here, and the climax of the movie is spent watching the characters run around being pursued by laughably idiotic shiny spheres. You start to feel sorry for poor Reggie Bannister.Phantasm II is quite simply one of the most atrocious horror movies I have ever seen. I'd expect to see something of this quality on a straight-to-TV channel. In one scene, Mike and Reggie find themselves in another dimension, being chased by some sort of mutant baby. This other dimension is filmed using a strobe effect -- the same sort of strobe effect that any average Joe is capable of applying on a handheld video camera. Sequences like this are what make Phantasm II insanely, laughably bad. There are no surprises in store here; all the characters are clichéd, their dialogue is clichéd, the love interests and sex scenes are clichéd. The only thing I came close to enjoying was the very end, which was not only unexpected but kept me thinking for a while afterwards.

The pace of the movie doesn't let up for a second and it does, therefore, manage to stay exciting and entertaining for it's duration. The sequel picks up, at first, where the first film left off; with Reggie Bannister battling dwarfs that have overrun his home. From there, the film switches to seven years later. Mike (James LeGros, in the role of one of the hero's of the first film) is now being released from a mental hospital after seven years of therapy. Despite this therapy, and admitting that it didn't actually happen, Mike still knows that the horrible goings on that landed him in the hospital in the first place actually happened and when he gets out he means to do something about it, and that is something that he does.As Mike says to Reggie at one point in the film, I'm a nineteen year old kid and you're a bald, middle-aged, ex-ice cream vendor; and that's what sets Phantasm aside from all the similar films in this vein of horror. The characters here, despite being in an abnormal situation, are not comically overblown and they don't have subhuman abilities; they're just normal people thrown into an abnormal situation. Reggie Bannister who, as mentioned, takes the role of 'Reggie' in the film, makes a great horror hero. Although not up to the high standard of Ash (Evil Dead) or most of the other hero's that the horror genre has given us, Reggie has a niche of his own. Most hero's aren't bald, middle-aged, ex-ice cream vendors but the fact that Reggie is not only highlights the tongue in cheek theme of the Phantasm series, but also gives the film a place of it's own within the horror genre.You'll be glad to know that this sequel features a chainsaw. The chainsaw is a weapon of such undeniable greatness that I find it hard to understand why anyone wouldn't want a chainsaw in their movie. The weapon is so far apart from all other melee weapons in terms of horror credibility that it almost has a life of it's own, just the way it sounds is enough to strike fear into the heart of many a viewer. The chainsaw enters the fray in a delicious sequence that sees our hero's raid a hardware store and tool up, a la Evil Dead II. At first, I thought that the movie would tease me in terms of the chainsaw; as in the early stages of the movie, it only features in a few scenes that see Reggie tear doors down and such, but the film doesn't disappoint as later on we get treated to a great sequence that involves Reggie battling another chainsaw wielding foe. I love chainsaws.One of the most memorable things about Phantasm were the silver spheres that flew up and down funeral parlour corridors, and we've got more of that here. The sequel is a lot more gory than I thought it would be, and that is no bad thing. The flying spheres feature a lot in the movie's more gory scenes, and I for one think that they are an ingenious creation. These balls attach themselves to their victim via two prongs on the front and then proceed to drill a hole through their head, which results in plenty of bloodshed coming out of the other end of the sphere. Lovely. Also like the first film, a lot of this movie takes place in funeral homes and other such morbid areas, and that creates a great horror feel that few horror films have matched.Overall, Phantasm 2 is a must see for fans of the original, and a must see for those that aren't yet fans of the original after they have seen the original. Don Coscarelli would later go on to direct one of 2002's best films in 'Bubba Ho-Tep', but it easy to see that the Phantasm series is his labour of love. The kind of heart that has gone into this series is overwhelming and even if you don't like the movie, you have to admire it, if only for the obvious amount of love that Don has for the series he created.

Since Mike is a bit of a psychic he knows that the Tall Man was responsible so he teams up with Reggie to track him down & put an end to his corpse stealing, mutant slave midget creating & murdering ways. Oh, & they would probably like to stop him blowing anymore of Reggie's homes & family members up too. They eventually track him down to a small town in Oregon called Perigord where he is in the middle of wiping out the entire town, together with a hitchhiker named Alchemy (Samantha Phillips) & an attractive woman named Liz (Paula Irvine) who both feature heavily in Mike's psychic visions he sets out for a final showdown to the death...Written & directed by Don Coscarelli this, the second of four Phantasm films so far, is probably as good as the series gets. The script is fast paced (not one but two house's are blown up within the first 15 minutes), never boring or dull & doesn't seem to treat itself too seriously which considering the overall silliness of it is a good thing. The character's aren't developed that much & are a little one-dimensional but they just about come across as likable enough for us to care about them. Phantasm II feels very 80's with everything done to excess, the car they drive around in, the over-the-top weapons they construct like the home made flamethrower & the double double barrelled (or maybe that should be quadruple barrelled) sawn off shotgun (wouldn't the recoil alone break your arm?), a chainsaw fight, lots more make-up effects than the original &, of course, the hairdo's. I'm not sure about the psychic stuff & if the Tall Man can make a house explode why can't he just, for example, make the car that Reggie & Mike are driving in explode? I liked the idea that the Tall Man travels across America robbing small town's of the contents of their graveyard's & as a whole the film worked well & has a certain engaging narrative. Director Coscarelli piles on the atmosphere & manages to film some cool horror sequences, the death of Father Meyers (Kenneth Tigar) by the series trademark silver sphere is memorable as it slices his ear off then drills into his forehead & there is a creepy scene when a worm like creature emerges from someones back & starts to talk. The girls look nice & even nicer without their tops on as we get a fair amount of nudity, in terms of gore there is the aforementioned death of Father Meyers, a sphere impales someones hand forcing them to chop it off with an axe & one works itself into someone's back & semi exit through their mouth, people are burned alive, embalmed with acid, a rat is blown to pieces & some unlucky guy has a chainsaw shoved between his legs, ouch. Made for about $3,000,000 Phantasm II easily has the biggest budget of the series, technically it shows with a very well made solid film throughout with some neat special effects, nice cinematography, good music & better than expected production values. The acting is OK but then again look at what these people had to work with, on a side note apparently according to the IMDb's 'Trivia' section Brad Pitt auditioned for the role of Mike... I liked Phantasm II, sure it's silly & ultimately isn't going to change anyone's life but it is entertaining & fun & as far as I'm concerned that's the only reasons I watch films, to have fun & be entertained. There are much worse ways to spend 90 odd minutes, definitely worth a watch.

The film almost takes entirely place in graveyards, mortuaries, abandoned ghost-towns and filthy vaults&#133;something that'll certainly attract gore-lovers and other sick puppies like myself&#133;;)To my regret, I must say I never saw the original Phantasm so maybe I'm missing out on yet a whole lot more&#133; One thing I can already say with certainty Phantasm is a very ingenious franchise with a solid horror villain ( The Tall Guy ) and inventive slashing methods. Number two mainly seems to handle about the hunt and (hopefully) eternal destroying of the Tall Man by Mike and Reggie. Mike spent seven years in an institution after witnessing the Tall Man's first adventure and Reggie is an ex-ice cream vendor (which gives you more or less an idea of the oppressed, dry humor in Phantasm). Agnus Scrimm in the shape of the Tall Man cheerfully continues to rob entire cemeteries and transforms the bodies into ugly dwarfs, while the heroes arm themselves with complete toolboxes and other home-made artillery that seem to come right out an episode of `The A-Team'. Absolute highlights in this light-headed, gory bunch are the spirited weapons in the form of metal spheres&#133;The plant themselves into the forehead of the victim and drill their way further into the brain. Very gruesomely yummy!! By the way&#133;it's also a very educational film if you're interested in learning about the principles and practices of embalming&#133;you never know, right?? Negative elements are the complete lack of tension and the dreadful love-story between Mike and the girl he communicates with through dreams. Bring out the beer and enjoy the bloodshed!

Just leave the tall man alone. He's only after the death anyway and it's not like he's trying to take over our world our anything like that. Besides, it seems to me that he only goes after you once you try to cross his path. But no, the success of the first movie caused this sequel to be made, as well as 2 more.It's a pretty late sequel, that got released 9 years after the first movie but yet the movie decides on featuring the same child characters from the first movie, even though they are grown ups now and look nothing like the characters out of the first movie, even though they are being played by the same actors.This time the movie had a significantly bigger budget to spend but the movie still remains just as messy to watch as the first movie. I still have no idea what is going on all the time and things seem to happen very randomly. I was just never taken by the story, or any of its action and excitement.Also as an horror movie this really falls short. Never understood why this movie is being liked so much by horror fans but I guess I'm just not that into the director/writer of this movie-series. I just found out he also wrote and directed BubbaHo-Tep, which is also a movie that has a real cult following and is being much appreciated but is a movie I just never could get into and didn't enjoyed watching all that much.To me it also really doesn't help much that he keeps borrowing heavily from other movies. Guess that in Don Coscarelli's he is paying homage but to me it just comes across as some lazy writing.Also the story as a whole for this movie is being pretty poorly written. Like I said, I couldn't even understand what was happening half of the time and the characters in this movie just never seem to have a plan or any clear motivations. It makes this movie pretty bad to watch.No, I'm just not a phan.4/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Some Gore But That's About It","Date":"21 October 2009","Score":"0 out of 28 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Phantasm II (1988) * 1/2 (out of 4) Sequel to the 1979 cult shocker has the two survivors, Mike (James LeGros) and Reggie (Reggie Bannister) once again trying to track down the Tall Man (Angus Scrimm) so that they can finally destroy him once and for all. While in a mental hospital, Mike was able to communicate with a young woman (Paula Irvine) who might just hold the key to something very deadly. I'm not a major fan of the original film but I remember watching this one as a kid many times because the subject was rather interesting to me and of course I had heard so much about it receiving a X rating for gore. I remember not caring for it too much back then and those feelings hold true with this latest viewing, which is at least a decade apart from the last one. I think the biggest issue I have with the film is that it seems like every scene should only last a few minutes yet they continue to drag on beyond belief. Just when you think the ending is near, you realize there's twenty-five minutes left to go. Instead of wrapping any of the scenes up, they just continue on and on and it makes the film rather boring due to all the dry spots where not much is going on. We keep hearing Mike and Reggie talk about what they're going to do yet it takes forever for them to do it. We know their main goal is to kill the Tall Man yet it takes forever. The stint in the psych hospital is drawn out, various car rides are drawn out and we get multiple dialogue sequences that are all drawn out. Once again none of the characters are developed that much and the reasons behind what the Tall Man is doing isn't ever too clear. The film does have a few good aspects with one being the special effects that are quite good. The sphere is back once again and the damage done with it certainly makes it one of the greatest killing devices in screen history. The performances are a mixed bag but Bannister is very natural and fun to like. Scrimm is back once again as the Tall Man and one has no problem seeing him in the role. "}]
