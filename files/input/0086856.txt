Whatever makes you happy, folks!  If trashing on a film that was seminal in the annals of low-budget cinematic resourcefulness makes you feel special then I'm happy for you.There is a reason we love this film.  The script is clever, a veritable mosaic of silly twists and throwaway jokes so layered that it takes multiple viewings to keep up with it all (favorite line It's not my ******* planet, Monkey Boy!).  And the direction and approach is equally exciting rather than annoy us with underfinanced special effects that pretend to be Lucasfilm quality, the director revels in his low budget, using conk shells as models for space ships and populating alien ship interiors with tubes, pipes, rods and duct tape.  The aliens come off as resourceful-albeit-goofy packrats, bumbling about and managing to stay just a few steps ahead of Buckaroo until the very end.For many of us over 30, this film was something special.  We caught it at midnight movie houses and relished in the warm presence of a movie made by people who shared our dark, twisted senses of humor.  In college, it was a regular rental; we held Bonzai parties, dressed as characters, turned it into our private video Rocky Horror.  No, it's not Citizen Kane ... but what do you want from a movie called Buckaroo Bonzai?

And if you are a real Star Trek fan, you will know that Yoyodyne Propulsion is on the commissioning plaque for the Enterprise as well as other Star Fleet vessels. The references to Grover's Mill and Orson Wells along with the whole deadpan tone of the film makes this an unbelievably funny experience.

Peter Weller plays Buckaroo, the titular neurosurgeon/inventor/modern-day samurai/Billy Joelesque rocker, and he plays him frightfully well, low-key and distant but with occasional glimmers of genius and intensity.  The stellar supporting cast includes Jeff Goldblum, Clancy Brown, John Lithgow, Christopher Lloyd, and Ellen Barkin, and they're all pretty darn good.I'm not even going to pretend to be rational or unbiased about this movie. It's too utterly offbeat and original and just damned _odd_ to not love. Some favorite scenes the opening sequence of the Jet Car test run; Buckaroo's phone call with the Black Lectroids, and his subsequent detection of the sinister Red Lectroid agents in his midst; the eerie recorded message from the Black Lectroid leader, the good guys who threaten to blow up Earth unless Buckaroo stops their enemy, Dr. Lizardo (Lithgow, in a truly twisted scene-chewing performance).  Yes, it looks cheesy and dated, but damn it, you have to take a stand somewhere in life, you have to roll up your sleeves and step up to the plate and put yourself on the line, and have the courage to say, I don't care what anyone thinks of me, I love this movie.  That's the way I feel about old Buckaroo and his Hong Kong Cavaliers, and I still consider myself a loyal Blue Blaze Irregular fifteen years after seeing this film.As a post-script, I'd like to mention that the novelization of this movie, written by Earl Mac Rauch, is great, and actually contains about 3 times the information and plot that is in the movie.  If you can find it on Amazon or at a garage sale somewhere, snap it up, it's worth the search.  Also, there's a script for BUCKAROO BANZAI VERSUS THE WORLD CRIME LEAGUE floating around too, which should be made no matter the cost if only to film one priceless scene - the cameo appearance of Jack Burton, Kurt Russell's swaggering truck driver hero from John Carpenter's BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA, who appears as a Blue Blaze Irregular and gives Team Banzai a lift!

Peter Weller lends a perfect, dead-pan seriousness to the very 'out there' proceedings, while John Lithgow chews up the scenery as the fiendish Dr. Lizardo. Ellen Barkin is particularly fetching as Penny Priddy, while Jeff Goldblum stakes out his turf with an engaging feverishness that is all his own. Christopher Lloyd takes a relatively low-key approach to his role and does well for it, allowing for Lithgow's extravagance. Welding the pieces together is a delirious, kinetic script by Earl M. Rauch.The film, although essentially a spoof of science fiction films and comic book superheroes, remains a delightful, inventive enigma of eighties cinema. The look of the picture is quite good, and (considering it's meager budget) highly-digestible. Given that the film never found a mass audience, it is surprising that so many individuals seem to remember it as vividly, and as fondly as they do. I can only hope that after everyone has gotten their fill of a certain galaxy far, far away, that a return to the more substantial basics of storytelling and characterization is deemed imperative. Meanwhile sit back, relax, and laugh yourself silly with a charming, 'little' film that tends to be so much more.

In his lab he perfects a device for travelling through solid matter on the pretext that 'solid matter' is in fact 80% empty space. True enough and so far so good.In the movie, the 80% of matter that is space turns out to be the 8th dimention, and Banzai unwittingly causes some nasty alien lectoids to enter our dimension. With the help of good lectoids he and his rock band have to save the day.John Lithgow really steals the show with some excellent madcap lines. The big name actors clearly knew this was not to be taken seriously and though the plot is OK it is the one-liners in the script that make the movie so enjoyable.  Special FX are early 80's par for the course, this is not the highest budget film ever! The only question is why didn't the advertised sequal ever make it to the screen?

It is full of subtle/dry humor and has an overall upbeat mood. The subtly dry humor is found in the background audio as well as the odds and ends that find their way into the set decor and dialog. These offer a nice array of silliness to punctuate the story with their own unique twists of humor.The cast is definitely All Star! Peter Weller (Robocop), John Lithgow (Third Rock from the Sun), Robert Ito (Quincy MD), Clancy Brown (Highlander), Ellen Barkin (Wild Bill), and Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future) all have fun and amusing roles. Even the minor roles are covered well by perhaps lesser known yet veteran cast members such as Rosalind Cash and Matt Clark.If you're a fan of British humor, you should definitely enjoy this one, even though it may take more than one viewing to catch all the subtleties. If you haven't been exposed to this style of humor, this certainly isn't a bad place to start! If, on the other hand, this style of humor is not what you enjoy, it may not be the one for you. For everyone else, kick back and enjoy! If it weren't a bit of a cult classic, I doubt it would be available on DVD. I give it a 7 out of 10 since it may not be for everyone.

Big deal.- A Lectroid commander in THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI. Greetings honorary members of the Hong Kong Cavaliers and to all you neutral observers and detractors as well. Hoping to clarify the mystery and purpose of this 1984 docudrama, I have scoured all available data (including movie reviews), scrutinized the musings of the film's director via the DVD's special features, and held extensive conferences with official representatives of the Banzai Institute for Biomedical Engineering and Strategic Information. I hasten to point out that my findings are inconclusive and that many questions remain. The film is (negatively) a rambling, disjointed pastiche of pseudo-hip, sci-fi/comic book inspired shenanigans that (positively) manages to generate inordinate amounts of charm and wonder through its fortuitous collusion of eccentric story line (battling aliens; a deeply depressed damsel-in-distress, (Penny Priddy); the actual Hong Kong Cavaliers honing their rock and roll chops; Buckaroo himself, pushing his new jet car- with the incredible Oscillation Overthruster -through the forbidding regions of the 8th dimension) and the glowing charisma of the actors at play John Lithgow's Dr. Lizardo is hilarious and ingenious. W.D. Richter's nerdy persona obscures his inability to fashion Earl Mac Rauch's free-wheeling screenplay into a coherent whole. Still, the many facets of the story remain intriguing and Michael Boddicker's synthesized music is majestic and buoyant. However, the questions persist. What did happen at Grover's Mill in October of 1938? Was Orson Welles part of an invasion plot that involved mass hypnosis? Are there extraterrestrial biological entities living among us?

There shalt be spoilers.**I was very fortunate and saw this movie when it was in the theaters in 1984 for all of about nine seconds.  I've seen it probably fifty or sixty times since then, and every time I do, it still cracks me up.  (To be truthful, some of the lines -- It's your hand, Buckaroo! -- can crack me up if they simply drift through my head.)Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension is, quite simply, brilliant.  This is the perfect example of a movie made for the intelligent moviegoer, and not dumbed down for the mass viewing audience.Peter Weller plays Buckaroo Banzai, a genius half-American, half-Japanese neurosurgeon, bad musician, and adventurer.  He is the leader of the Hong Kong Cavaliers, his backup band/fellow adventurers.  Buckaroo and his colleague, Professor Hikita, have created a device called the Oscillation Overthruster, which allows Buckaroo to drive a highly modified Ford F-350 pickup through a mountainside and into the space between the molecules, the Eighth Dimension.When Dr. Emilio Lizardo, a former colleague of Professor Hikita, finds out about the overthruster, he breaks free from an asylum where he was residing (likely since 1938) to steal the overthruster.  You see, in 1938, Dr. Lizardo fell into the Eighth Dimension and was taken over by a Red Lectroid from Planet 10 named John Whorfin.  John has been imprisoned in Dr. Lizardo since then and wants to return home.When Dr. Lizardo breached the dimensional barrier, he freed many Red Lectroids who were being imprisoned there.  All are named John and arrived on Earth, in Grover's Mill, New Jersey on Halloween night, 1938.  They all want to return home.  But to do so, they will have to steal the overthruster from Buckaroo and his Cavaliers, who don't want to let it go.Peter Weller is wonderful as Buckaroo, playing him with a Zen-like coolness that many have mistaken for woodenness.  He is quick with his own koan-type sayings  No matter where you go, there you are, and This will change your life.  Or not.  Weller finds the character quickly and plays him for all he is worth.Also amusing is the way Weller is verbally described as half-Japanese, but appears to have no Oriental features.  It strikes me to be in the manner of a pulp magazine, where the only Orientals drawn were always villains. However, many of the heroes of the pulps had mystical Oriental training, were raised by wild pandas, etc.The Cavaliers are well-casted and acted, particularly Reno Nevada (Pepe Serna), Rawhide (Clancy Brown), and Perfect Tommy (Lewis Smith).  There are even hints about other Cavaliers, who aren't in the movie, such as Pecos, who is in Tibet.Ellen Barkin does a fairly good job with her role as the clearly-psychotic Penny Priddy (though far from her best role) and Jeff Goldblum perfectly nails his role as the brain surgeon Sidney, who becomes the cowboy Cavalier, New Jersey.  I personally think it's his best role ever.The villains are fantastic.  John Lithgow's Lizardo is the all-time over-the-top hoot.  Christopher Lloyd, Dan Hedaya, and Vincent Schiavelli all show up as various Black Lectroids, all named John.Carl Lumbly makes an early acting appearance as a good Red Lectroid, the dreadlocked John Parker.  His grin and sunny demeanor lighten up the coming apocalypse and makes his character one of the most likable ones ever on the silver screen.The movie is low-budget and looks it.  Don't be fooled into thinking this matters.  The low-budget look perfectly fits the pulp fiction quality that the story demanded.  The special effects border on cheesy, but fit the story to a T.This movie is one of the great science fiction movies, simply because it knew exactly what it was, and it gave the viewer exactly that.  It was at once a spoof of 50's era science fiction and a celebration of all things sci fi.  It steeped the work in the pulp styles of Doc Savage and poked gentle fun at the pseudo-science used in those same books.  It also firmly establishes itself in the '80's, and savagely sends up the politics and fashions of the same decade.I can't give this movie a grade.  I love it too much.  It's not perfect, but it's damn close.  If you have a solid three-digit IQ and you haven't seen this movie, do so.  I envy you for still having the experience in front of you.If you think that the late '90s Godzilla was pretty good, that Men In Black rocked, and that Independence Day was the greatest movie ever...don't bother.  This movie isn't for you.For those of us who know and love this movie  isn't it great to be rewarded for being smart?

Richter, is laced with clever dialogue, action, adventure and surprises.  And where else are you ever going to find a main character who is a scientist, brain surgeon and rock n' roll star all rolled up into one?	After years of research, Buckaroo Banzai (Peter Weller) and his colleague, Professor Hikita (Robert Ito), have successfully developed an `overthruster,' a device that has allowed Buckaroo to pass through solid matter-- a mountain, in fact-- driving through it at high speed in his specially designed and equipped car.  But when his achievement hits the news, it captures the attention of the mad Dr. Emilio Lizardo (John Lithgow), who catches the story on television from his room in the insane asylum, where he has been a resident for many years, ever since his own attempt at developing an overthruster failed.  	But though Lizardo's trial run with the overthruster failed, it did put him in contact with alien beings from another realm, one of whom-- Lord John Whorfin-- has since that encounter inhabited Lizardo's mind and body.  They are Red Lectroids from Planet 10 by way of the 8th dimension, stranded on earth (in human form) and awaiting the development of the overthruster, which will enable them to return home.  These are dangerous and resourceful beings, and they are about to take Buckaroo Banzai-- currently on tour with his band, The Hong Kong Cavaliers-- by surprise.  And soon, all that will stand between the Red Lectroids and the destruction of the earth, will be Buckaroo, his band and some help from his loyal followers, the `Blue Blazer Regulars.'	Working from the highly imaginative, clever and detailed screenplay by Earl Mac Rauch, Richter has fashioned and delivered a colorful and exciting adventure filled with subtle humor, the unexpected and an array of outrageous characters, from Whorfin and the Lectroids (all of whom have the first name `John'), to Buckaroo's cohorts like `Perfect Tommy (Lewis Smith)' and New Jersey (Jeff Goldblum), to the alluring, mysterious woman Buckaroo encounters, Penny Priddy (Ellen Barkin).  It's an unconventional, yet readily accessible film that Richter has packed with interesting asides, lines and situations, all of which drive the story forward and keep you guessing as to what could possibly happen next.  He throws so much at you, in fact, that it's impossible to catch it all the first time through; but it's a movie that lends itself to repeated viewings, because it's exactly what this kind of film is supposed to be  Pure entertainment from start to finish.	Peter Weller is perfectly cast as Buckaroo, and he successfully captures all of the elements that make his character the ultimate Renaissance Man of the immediate future.  With this performance, Weller becomes the personification of the genius, adventurer and master-of-all-things; it's the definitive portrayal of a unique individual, quite unlike any ever presented on the silver screen before.  Weller's Buckaroo is intelligent and self-assured-- watching him you get the feeling there's always something going on in his head, and always a step ahead of the next guy-- and it's his ability to convey the complexities of the character that makes him believable, and his incredible exploits seem credible.  Simply put, Weller has taken a comic book character and made him real, and it makes the film work.	As Lizardo/Whorfin, John Lithgow takes it magnificently over the top with a character that is something of a precursor to his High Commander Dick Solomon on TV's `3rd Rock from the Sun.'  And watching this guy in action is a real kick.  He's larger than life, wildly animated and extroverted, while affecting an accent that's a veritable smorgasbord of dialect.  He lumbers along like a mutated Quasimodo, and when he gives a speech to his fellow Red Lectroids about going `home,' it's one of the most hilarious scenes you're ever going to see anywhere.  There's definitely a method to Lithgow's madness, and it's a terrific performance.	Christopher Lloyd also turns in a winning performance as another of the Red Lectroids, `John Bigboote,' and his exchanges with Lithgow are a riot (especially when Lizardo insists on calling him `Big-Booty,' and Bigboote adamantly insists that it is pronounced `Bigboo-TAY!').  And that's just an example of the many, many finer and detailed elements Richter uses to make this film so enjoyable and successful, from consistently funny verbal exchanges to broad physical humor, all interspersed with the action and woven seamlessly into the story.	The additional supporting cast includes Rosalind Cash (John Emdall), Pepe Serna (Reno Nevada), Matt Clark (McKinley), Clancy Brown (Rawhide), Carl Lumbly (John Parker), Vincent Schiavelli (John O'Connor), Dan Hedaya (John Gomez), Bill Henderson (Casper), Damon Hines (Scooter), Billy Vera (Pinky Carruthers), Ronald Lacey (President Widmark) and William Traylor (General Catburd).  A film that will take you on a wild ride and into regions beyond the known, `The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension' is that most rare treasure among cinematic discoveries  A truly unique film.  It's enthralling and entertaining, and will keep you laughing and involved no matter how many times you see it.  And it's filled with great lines you'll be able to quote endlessly and use for any occasion.  Or, as Buckaroo himself would say, `No matter where you go, there you are...'  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.

After the surgery, Banzai's experiment with the Overthruster proves to be a success. Later that evening, Dr. Banzai decides to unwind by performing live with those hard-rocking group of scientists, the Hong Hong Cavaliers, at a club owned by a fellow named Artie. Artie could care less about Banzai's scientific breakthrough, he just wants some music out of these characters. During the performance, a suicide attempt by a young woman named Penny Priddy (HOT Ellen Barkin) is thwarted by a clumsy cocktail waitress. She is apprehended immediately by authorities and taken away. The following day, Dr. Banzai springs her from jail cell due to the fact he believes she is his murdered ex-wife's twin sister whom she was separated from at birth.Life gets even more complicated for Dr. Banzai when he, along with the help of Dr. Sidney Zweibel (Jeff Goldblum), discover Lectroids by Planet 10 by way the 8th dimension invaded Grovers Mill, New Jersey 50 years before. Orson Welles' 1939 War Of The Worlds radio broadcast actually wasn't a hoax, Zweibel concludes. In the years since this invasion, the Lectroids - who look like regular folks to those who don't have the formula - have basically taken over a weapons manufacturer under contract by the D.O.D. and are in the process of planning global annihilation. Unfortunately the President, whose back is killing him, is oblivious to this fact as he leads a country crippled by a looming cold war with Russia. It's up to Team Banzai to take matters into their own hands, especially after the Lectroids abduct Penny and steal the overthruster which they would need in order to get back into the 8th dimension where they once resided.I first saw Buckaroo Banzai when I was in Jr. high during it's brief run at the theaters and am still quite fond of the film as an adult. Earl MacRauch's creative and original script is packed with exceptionally witty dry humor. Repeated viewings are a must in order to take it all in. It is no secret that this offbeat sci-fi adventure / comedy has developed a huge cult following over the years, and there's no doubt MacRauch along with director W.D. Richter made this movie with that intention.With this and RoboCop, Peter Weller should be proud of having appeared in two 80's classics. The rest of the supporting cast is great too. The underrated Clancy Brown shines in a small role as Buck's ill-fated counterpart Rawhide, and John Lithgow gives an outstanding performance as Dr. Lizardo / Lord Whorfin. One of the many great aspects of this movie is that you feel a real sense of camaraderie amongst the members of 'Team Banzai'.I must acknowledge that over the years I have recommended this film to several people and they came back to me saying it was one of the worst movies they have ever seen.

It's a spoof of all those 1950's-era Sci-Fi films where the incredibly bad science interpretation is played completely seriously. I mean, c'mon, the Overthruster tracking device with the UPS-truck turn-signal click should have clued you in that someone isn't quite serious here.What we've got here is a great romp with some future mega-stars having a great time. Lithgow's performance alone is worth the price of admission. Ellen Barkin is luscious in both that pink dress and her tied-up black skirt. That jail-cell flirtation scene... well, what more can I say? Those wonderful in-jokes Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems. YOYO-dyne? The Future Begins Tomorrow... well, of course it does. Negative, we do not have crossover... we are over New Jersey. All is not lost. Well, of course it isn't... or is it? (Born and raised there, Woodbridge Twp., sorry. To this day, my sister and brother-in-law live in New Brunswick, I'm not making this up.) If you own the DVD, as I do, then you probably know that practically nothing was created for this film. The Red Lectroid bivouac was an abandoned Firestone tire factory. If you ever did high-school drama, you probably recognized Lizardo's foot-pedals as an ancient lighting dimmer board. The spinning Styrofoam cup in the shock tower (an automotive term) takes the cake.There is so much going on in this low-low-budget film to laugh with, not at. If you watch this film looking not to trash it but to laugh with it, I think you will get far, far more out of it.I only wish they had been able to make the sequel.And finally, I originally saw this film when it was first released, in the Harvard Square cinema in Cambridge, Mass. The screening was sparsely attended, but you could tell that some people got it even then, and many didn't. Too bad.

Just looking at the list of great actors that starred in this movie should be enough for any serious movie fanatic to become giddy with excitement, and rightly so.First of all, Peter Weller gives a stunning performance as the main character Buckaroo Banzai, an archetypical Renaissance Man whose expertise spans a significant number of different subject areas. A neurosurgeon, musician, quantumphysicist, and real-time action hero all rolled into one, he delves into the unfolding adventure in such a fearless manner that it makes our usual Rambo, Indiana Jones, or even James Bond characters that we are so used to watching seem wet behind the ears. Joining our main character there are the incredible performances of wellknown names such as Jeff Goldblum, John Lithgow, and Christopher Lloyd to name but a few.This in-your-face line up of top class actors gives the viewer the setup for a incredibly entertaining movie in which the action and comedy never seems to stop, never ceases to be interesting and more importantly remains plausible. Because apart from it being great entertainment, it also provides a very real message that for its day, was years ahead of its time. The quantumphysical theme throughout the whole movie (I doubt whether the term 'quantumphysical' even existed back then) will carry on teasing the eager mind and will keep you thinking for a long time. Could it be possible that this movie provided the inspiration for other box office science fiction hits such as Back to the Future or even Clive Barker's Hellraiser? Same goes for the interdimensional alien invasion theme in contrast to aliens from outer space which has since been overused many times. But this science fiction/action/adventure movie does it in a way that grabs a hold of you and has no intention of letting you go for the rest of it's enjoyable ride. And neither do you want it to.I can somewhat relate to the criticism concerning the costumes and special effects. However, considering the cheap and simplistic costumes paired with the (sometimes) incredible popularity of a series such as Star Trek for instance, I truly believe the real science fiction lover will look beyond this and appreciate the overall atmosphere of the movie. Humanoid aliens may perhaps be a little less exciting than the CGI monsters in movies such as the Alien trilogy but hey, in The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension this just plainly isn't the case. We're dealing with Lectoids. And in this case, it's as real and exciting as it gets.Comedy lovers also get their fair share of laughs, as this movie is laden with the craziest situations and jammed with drywitted oneliners. All in all this is a very underrated movie that will never get old. Definitely a classic that everyone should watch at least twice. You probably will, since the long-awaited sequel sadly never was made.

Ellen Barkin is so easy on the eyes that we hardly notice the incongruity of her character. And what other film can boast three of the most eccentric actors in the business?

Richter (himself a writer of such things as the 1978 version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers) present to cult movie lovers a rollicking and memorable tribute to and send-up of the Saturday matinée serials of decades past. It has its heart in the right place while maintaining a completely irreverent attitude, a fair amount of invention, and a goofy unpredictability (even while telling what is ultimately a time-honoured tale of alien invasion). The movie features one of the most eclectic casts you'll see in this sort of thing, right down to the small roles. It's got fun alien makeup (by the Burman studio), an appreciable amount of cheese, some choice bits of dialogue, and a colourful bunch of cool characters.Peter Weller stars as the Buckaroo Banzai of the title, a celebrity and jack of all trades he's a neurosurgeon, physicist, government troubleshooter, jet car test driver, and rock star all in one. He works with a dedicated team of fellow scientists and musicians dubbed The Hong Kong Cavaliers. They find that it's up to them to save the day when extraterrestrial villains called Lectroids start acting up. Among the newest members of Buckaroo's team are the troubled Penny Priddy (an appealing Ellen Barkin) and jovial New Jersey (Jeff Goldblum); the nemesis is Lord John Whorfin, who's taken over the body of a scientist named Emilio Lizardo (both roles are played by John Lithgow, who's in peak hammy form).You know you're in for some good times when you peruse the cast list Christopher Lloyd, Lewis Smith, Rosalind Cash, Robert Ito, Pepe Serna, Ronald Lacey (the Nazi torturer from Raiders of the Lost Ark playing the President of the United States here!), Matt Clark, Clancy Brown, Carl Lumbly, Vincent Schiavelli, Dan Hedaya, Bill Henderson, Billy Vera, Jonathan Banks, John Ashton, and none other than Yakov Smirnoff playing the National Security Adviser! Everybody is fun to watch, with Weller thoroughly engaging as the game-for- anything Buckaroo, a man destined from birth to be something special. There's some poignancy here and there, but cast & crew commit to mostly keeping an upbeat spirit while the insanity of this movie plays out.This viewer is glad there is an audience for stuff like this (it *does* have a following); this is the kind of thing that ought to get encouraged more often.The end credits with Buckaroo and buddies marching through an aquaduct is irresistible and ends the proceedings on a true high note.Eight out of 10.

Is it a movie that failed at the box office yet found an audience on home video such as Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas or Office Space? Is it a film that's so bad it's good such as Troll 2 or The Room? Or is a cult film just a movie with a rabid fan base that will throw out dialogue after dialogue and adorn rooms with odd memorabilia?Really a cult film can be all these things; the phenomenon of cult cinema has been around since the 50's with the infamously bad films of Ed Wood and it doesn't seem to be stopping any time soon. The purpose of these reviews is to bring the weird, wonderful and downright insanity of cult cinema to you. The reviews will be broken up into the main review itself as well as quotable lines and oddest moments. Many will choose The Rocky Horror Picture Show as the ultimate piece of cult cinema, but really it's become so mainstream it defies cult films. The real king of cult cinema is the 1984 film The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension.Film The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension Director W.D Richter Cast Peter Weller, John Lithgow, Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum, Christopher Lloyd.The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension is possibly the most nonsensical film ever to be put on celluloid. The majority of it doesn't make a lick of sense, the plot flies by without letting the audience really understand it, and we're just thrown into this world full of myth and science fiction and we just have to accept it. This is the beauty of the film, it just forces you to accept everything and enjoy it. Banzai is a melting pot of genres, a weird high-bred of action adventure, science fiction, comedy, satire, and romance and none of it makes sense yet it's a brilliantly original and enjoyable film.The plot follows the adventures of Buckaroo Banzai (Robocop himself, Peter Weller) a physicist, neurosurgeon, test pilot, and rock star who, along with his rock band/assistants, The Hong Kong Cavaliers must stop a group of inter dimensional aliens, lead by John Lithgow's alien leader, Lord John Whorfin trapped inside the body of an Italian scientist, in order to save the world. The film just drops you into all of this, creating an incredible myth surrounding Buckaroo and his band and intrigue among the audience about what exactly is going on.The beauty of the film (much like many cult classic) is that its flaws are also its greatest strength. The dialogue can be incredibly heavy on the techno babble at times attempting to explain the science of the film, and it can confuse the audience, but within two seconds there's some great joke or dead pan delivery made and we're sucked right back in. The cinematography isn't really all that spectacular, its flat and very colourful and really isn't great, but in Buckaroo Banzai it works because it makes the whole film look like a comic book come to life. That's the best way to describe Buckaroo Banzai; it's an old 80's comic book that somehow jumped onto the silver screen.The performances are all very solid in that great cult cinema way. Peter Weller is believably charismatic as Banzai, who delivers his lines with a deadpan that would make Bill Murray jealous. Banzai's Hong Kong Cavaliers include great eccentric performances by such actors as Jeff Goldblum playing a New Jersey cowboy, and Clancy Brown as Banzai's own personal narrator, Rawhide. The crown jewel of the film in terms of performances however, goes to John Lithgow playing the villainous role of Lord John Whorfin in the most over the top, insane way possible throwing out lines with an Italian accent that makes Super-Mario seem legitimate. It's a performance that will be forever remembered as one of the most brilliantly funny portrayals in cult cinema history.If the film has any legitimate flaws it's that we don't get to see enough of Banzai working with his team as they all seem like brilliant characters that just don't get enough screen time. The love story between Banzai and Penny Pretty (Ellen Barkin) isn't given all that much time to develop and could have been more interesting, especially with her being the long lost twin sister of Banzai's murdered wife.The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension really is the ultimate cult classic, it bombed at the box office, at times it's so bad it's good and it has a rabid fan base that are still clamouring for a sequel. It's a must see film if you're a fan of cult cinema a truly brilliant piece of pop cinema that is so insane it works. Buckaroo Banzai is by far the weirdest film around and it's brilliant.

More subtle than Rocky Horror, more intelligent than any self-important Spielberg offering, and best of all, a showcase of the best costumes of the worst 1980s clothing styles including huge shoulder padded costumes worn by men and women.

Although the two have no plot material in common, the names of corporations and characters in the film are an obvious homage to the one of the writer's finest works. This film is hamstrung by poor sound quality, which makes it a bit of a challenge to watch. The nature of its humor (multi-layered and quite subtle) when combined with the slushy sound virtually guaranteed that it would fail in the theatre, but if released today might have made up the difference in DVD sales. I have seen the film probably 20 times and still notice new little tidbits of humor (hidden by the subtlety, not the sound). Lithgow is magnificent in it, Weller plays the cool guy to the hilt, and the surrounding cast is just a hoot. One of them just showed up on Lost which really pleased me as I hadn't seen him in other rolls in years. Buckaroo Bonzai is like the TV show Firefly -- if you're a fan you almost feel like a member of a fraternity or club. There's an inside edge to it that gets you excited when you run into a fellow Bonzai fan -- all the more intriguing because you get to compare notes on any jokes you may have missed.

But then again there's the problem that the movie is not really funny and on top of that, also not so very well made. Guess the movie can best be seen as a cult-classic, for the fans of it.To be honest, the movie began well and promising. It developed some potentially interesting characters and plot lines but for some reason as the movie progresses they don't get handled well. The movie becomes more crazy and crazy as the movie heads toward the ending. At one point I even stopped caring and wanting to understand what the movie was all about. It was confusing, it was poor but above all it was odd.The movie could had been fun, the movie could had been action filled but yet it all isn't. It's wasted potential, cause I guess that in essence Buckaroo Banzai isn't really a bad fun movie main-hero.The movie is only fun now really with its character's names. All of the alien's their first name is John and they have names such as John Bigboote, John O'Connor and John Smallberries. But other than that, there isn't really much fun present in the movie. The many famous actors however still provide the movie with some fun and this uplifts the movie. Amazing how many great actors are in this movie such as Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum, Christopher Lloyd, Clancy Brown, Ronald Lacey, Vincent Schiavelli and Dan Hedaya. John Lithgow is deliciously overacting as the movie its main villain but I just wish that he had more sequences and was made more interesting as a character. Peter Weller was a great leading man in the '80's and he shows with this movie how well he can carry a movie.The special effects are all decent for '80's standards but perhaps overused a bit too much. The musical score is typically '80's like and absolutely horrible. Further more the movie is fairly well looking, too bad inexperienced director W.D. Richter doesn't know how to use everything to its full potential.Yet it's not all that bad and the movie still entertains, so the movie obviously still has some redeeming qualities which makes this still a bit of a watchable movie.5/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"precursor to Men in Black","Date":"22 December 2004","Score":"6 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Romance","Review":" Considering the success of Men in Black, Buckaroo should have at least been a moderate hit, in that it is no more or less strange and entertaining than that later sci-fi-alien-invading human cartoon.

Due to the vehicle's oscillation overthruster, Mr. Weller emerges unscathed - he and his Jet Car pass through solid matter. Unfortunately, the car picks up a glob of inter-dimensional matter. Coincidentally (actually, not coincidentally ), super-weird physicist John Lithgow (as Emilio Lizardo) ends his five decade residency at the New Brunswick Home for the Criminally Insane...As it turns out, Mr. Lithgow is an alien (they are all named John) from Planet 10. On Halloween 1938, Lithgow and some Red Lectroids arrived on Earth. Their mission failed, and many were thrown into The 8th Dimension. This event was, by the way, was misinterpreted as an invasion from Mars, by Orson Welles, during his infamous October 30, 1938 radio broadcast version of H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds. By the late 1960s, other media hinted at the continued Lectroid presence. Examples include ABC-TV's The Invaders and novelist Thomas Pynchon's The Crying of Lot 49.Presently, defeating the Red Lectroid invaders is up to multi-talented Buckaroo Banzai (Weller) and his hard-rocking team of Hong Kong Cavaliers Lewis Smith (as Perfect Tommy), Jeff Goldblum (as New Jersey), Clancy Brown (as Rawhide), Pepe Serna (as Reno Nevada), and Billy Vera (as Pinky Carruthers). Suicidal Ellen Barkin (as Penny Priddy) provides Banzai romantic interest.The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai (Across the 8th Dimension) is intelligent fun, from writer Earl Mac Rauch and director W.D. Richter. Lithgow is a perfect Lectroid, Laugh while you can, monkey boy! Really, he and the likes of Vincent Schiavelli (as John O'Connor) couldn't be anyone but aliens, could they? In hindsight, perhaps the Black Letroid and Penny Priddy parts might have been better re-worked. Still, it's a classic.

It's so, well 80's but it isn't completely trapped in it. What it's about is... damn, should I even try? Actually, it does have a cohesive narrative, and more surprising because in the first few minutes, even with opening crawl, one is a little lost in exactly what's going on except a) Buckaroo Banzai had an American mother and Japanese father (and is played by Peter Weller who doesn't look like the latter much at all), and b) he goes through dimensions or something looking for martial arts moves. We soon find out he has mastered driving a car through mountains- since, you know, they are loaded with empty spaces and the particles are just so tiny to bother with- and has discovered an alien being, all of this in New Jersey.WHICH, you may recall, was the place where Orson Welles's rendition of War of the Worlds was placed in in the small town of Grover's Mill... turns out it wasn't a hoax and aliens had actually taken over Welles's mind and made him put on the broadcast. And, indeed, aliens have come to earth and may incinerate it and/or have the Russians involved somehow if Buckaroo and his men of scientists-cum-rock-and-rollers don't fight back against the maniacal Dr. Lizardo (John Lithgow playing some kind of, um, Italian baddie zapped with Alien prowess). Can he do it in time or will the president have to resort to war? Can he save his damsel-in-distress in the form of suicidal-turned-doctor Penny Priddy (Ellen Barkin)? Why is Jeff Goldblum dressed up as a cowboy for the bulk of the movie AND from Fort Lee, NJ (a town, incidentally, not very far from my own home)? All these questions and more are... answered I suppose during The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai. This is like someone digested a whole truckload of pulp/sci-fi/whatever comic books and adventure serials- think Howard the Duck if it was *intentionally* awesome- and wrote a screenplay. Where else will we get Peter Weller, cinema's RoboCop AND star of Naked Lunch, playing a sort of super-hero who rocks out amazingly, invents things, propels through time and space, and can kill easily and swiftly while fighting for the woman on his arm? And where else will we see John Lithgow snarl and bug-eye Italian (?) and do all odds and ends of WOW things that mark this as a major career achievement? Here is where, and it's a lot of fun to see every cheesy line spoke (Damn John Whorfin and the horse he rode in on or BigbooTAY! or even If you fail, we will be forced to help you destroy yourselves!) with the kind of delivery that just goes to show how much a would-be Buckaroo Banzai ala Southland Tales fails so much by comparison.It's a wonder to behold, with every crazy synthesizer beat, with every other new turn of a wacky performance, and of course that final end credits sequence that will be etched in my mind forever as something really great to keep me in my seat before turning off the TV. This is how a 'cult' film should operate don't try and please everyone, just do what you set out to do, however tenacious and maniacal and manic it may be with however many willing and able character actors and/or occasional stars, and you'll please immensely those who look for this kind of stuff.

It suffers from a deficit of exposition. I have read the many negative reviews of this movie, and that is my Diagnosis.It does not follow a plot, from A to B to C to D, like a typical,predictable story. The typical viewer wants a narrative, which flows from one point to another, as many thousands of movies Do, and Should. For example, Shakespeare's Hamlet comes home, his Dad is dead, and his mother married the alleged fiend who did it. Hamlet must prove this foul deed was done by an evil man, and punish those who helped make it happen. Over five acts, Hamlet becomes a man, leaves his boyhood behind, loses his beloved mother-who betrayed him by marriage to a murderer-and ultimately, Hamlet destroys the kingdom, himself, and his rightful kingship.The play Hamlet makes me wonder at its timeless and ingenious beauty and its ultimate cruel and heartless end to a resplendently fine man. It is a crushing blow to me to watch it, or even think of it.Hamlet will live in me forever. It is a linear, understandable plot. Meanwhile, Buckaroo Banzai is an outstanding work of art which didn't get the Spielberg seal of approval. Or at least as I could imagine Spielberg-who directed the ridiculous and failed 1941 another challenging comedy, which has genius and failure in it. This movie Buckaroo Banzai is outlandish and beautiful. It suffers, some may say, from a deficit of exposition.The characters, the casting, the silly situations all shout to the viewer what a lovely work of fineness this is. Peter Weller is supremely well-suited to play a polyglot genius, Buckaroo Banzai, who battles the 8th dimensional goof balls, who seek galactic domination, or-whatever. John Lithgow is supremely gifted as a para-dimensional psycho with a good/bad Italian accent. This is the role of his lifetime. He not only chews the scenery, he digests it. Ellen Barkin is just supreme as the drunken lonely sexually hot suicide who finds meaning as an adjunct to the fine cowboy cavaliers who ride with Buckaroo Banzai. Jeff Goldblum, in woolly chaps, ten-gallon hat and bright double-breasted cowboy shirt is a SIGNAL moment in movie history. Oh wait- Jeff Goldblum IS HIMSELF a great iconic ACTOR who both RIDICULES himself, and then RISES above his own SELF-RIDICULE. He is an acting genius. This movie ignores Goldblum's fine acting moment, and scurries along to the next ridiculous scene. This is HUGE. This bad movie skips ahead to the next point sorry pal, you just missed it. This movie is a narrative but with the exposition,connecting parts cut out-for a very good reason It makes the movie an exceptional work of art, which will live as a model for many dozens of comedies to come. The dialog itself is a roller-coaster ride that never quite adds up-or does it? I couldn't decide. The movie presumes to decode the great mystery of Orson Welles, and well,does, or, whatever..... This is a beautiful movie, and a great gift. However silly it may be- this is a great movie.

Seems aliens hypnotized Orson Wells into doing The War of the Worlds radio broadcast to cover up their actual landing on Earth in 1939. Every one plays it straight. Even Buckaroo's cowboy scientist pals (including Jeff Goldblum wearing a bright red cowboy outfit that must have come from Bob Hope's western comedy Fancy Pants).

It is a pulp comic book, serial adventure, sci-fi, action-comedy movie with a dose of romance thrown in. John Lithgow's over the top performance as Doctor Lizardo and Peter Weller's superb job as Buckaroo along with the comic relief of Jeff Goldblum and scene stealing steamy innocence of Ellen Barkin help make this a true classic and one of my favorite movies of all time. The closest movie I can compare it to is another one of my favorites, Big Trouble in Little China.For those who have not seen the movie, Buckaroo Banzai is a world famous Neurosurgeon, rock star, comic book character, rocket car driver and scientist. He also has his own organization of boy-scout like groups called Blue Blazers. His band, The Hong Kong Cavaliers, are a group of top scientists and all around good guys with very distinct personalities. Penny Pretty is the love interest of Buckaroo, who also happens to be his deceased wife's long lost twin sister. There is so much going on in this movie that I probably saw it three times before I totally understood the whole story. Which in a nutshell is Black Lectoids = good. Red Lectoids = bad. Dr. Lizardo is a Red Lectoid. The Black Lectoids have discovered that arch criminal Dr. Lizardo is on the loose on planet Earth and they threaten to wipe out the entire planet to make sure that he does not escape. They give Buckaroo 24 hours to capture or kill him before they put their annihilation plan into place. With his band and a few others, Buckaroo infiltrates the hideout of Dr. Lizardo and manage to set things right. I really could go on for pages on details on the story and the plot, but you wouldn't believe me. There is no way anyone could have gotten so much into a 102 minute movie. And do you know what the most frustrating part is? At the end they display to be on the lookout for Buckaroo Banzai and the World Crime Syndicate. They obviously had plans to make another film after this one made everyone rich and famous. When that didn't happen (at least from this movie) that meant that the sequel didn't happen. The screenplay has been written for years and now and again talk comes up that all of the main characters needed for a sequel are interested, but still nothing has come of it.The disk is great with tons of extras including the segments Jet Car All Access, Pinky Caruthers Unknown Facts and an alternate opening scene. There is another segment titled Buckaroo Banzai Declassified Documentary which is from the viewpoint that he is a real person.

No spoilers here though - you'll need to watch the movie to find out why.It's a fun, quirky movie with the apparently simple goal of taking the viewer along for a fun ride. The movie is full of quick little throw-away lines, odd signs, and strange PA announcements you might miss if you assume they're just background noise for the scene (There are monkey-boys in the facility).The movie doesn't stop to explain much, so you need to pay attention (or just watch the movie more than once!). The movie hints at deeper backgrounds for each character. The Hong Kong Cavaliers, even the ones that don't get to say much, come across as good teammates with confidence and responsibilities of their own, not just as minor followers for the hero.The alien masks seem like they would have been too heavy and inflexible to allow any expression, but the masks retained enough features of their human counterparts to let you know which one's which, and the actors were able to convey mood and expression through the masks. Christopher Lloyd does a very good job, and I always enjoy seeing Vincent Schiavelli in a movie.One thing I've always liked about John Lithgow is that he seems never to play the same role twice. He looks like he's having a lot of over-the-edge fun as John Whorfin.A bit of trivia A company called TGV (later bought by another company) made a software product called Multinet. The Multinet documentation used Yoyodyne as the hypothetical company that appeared in examples. I believe it used other names from Buckaroo Banzai as well.Sit back and let the fun happen!

My reply was that it was a piece of art work that attracted a certain following which held the work was a classic, i.e., has all the attributes of something to be venerated.  The simple fact is, what is a classic to some, can be dog-do to another.  Ultimately, it depends what you like.  I like this film.  Why?  It is kooky, unpredictable, full of fun, does not take itself too seriously and has a lot of great people.  To begin with, there is pre-Robocop Peter Weller as the brilliant brain surgeon, rock star, scientist and spy, Buckeroo Banzai.  Lithgow is there too, having a field day hamming it up along with funny Christopher Lloyd.  Ellen Barkin and Jeff Goldblum also show up.  The scene where Lloyd flips off Lithgow is hilarious but my favorite takes place in the jail where Weller comes to rescue Barkin.  Now, bear in mind, I was teaching at the U. of Wyoming in Laramie, WY and saw this film at a tiny arts theater in that town.  When Barkin admits she's not only from Wyoming but from...Laramie...we all went bananas.  We knew why she was so traumatized!  But, hey, the line would have worked if I'd seen in it in Berkeley.  The quirky is always difficult to pull off.  There is a fine line between being off beat and off the track.  As one who finds teenage slice 'n dice films a proper substitute for an emetic, I enjoy the non-heros seen in the films of the Coen brothers, Guy Ritchie and Ridley Scott.  If these heros have virtue, it is often overtaken by their humanity.  The same applies to satire.  This film shows some very fine actors having a lot of fun.  The zany Christopher Lloyd has shown up time and again in amusing roles.  Weller has gone on to show he's a fine actor.  Ellen Barkin likewise has grown in her career.  But this film is a gem, amusing, entertaining and full of turns and twists which add up to a fun time, well worth the price of the ticket I paid of the cost of a video or DVD.

A cult classic, this send-up of alien invasion stories, pulp fiction heroes, and adventure movies is a love/hate proposition; while I found it to be brilliant fun, many of my friends thought it was incomprehensible! One thing for sure...There is NO other film quite like it! Buckaroo (played with laid-back coolness by Peter Weller) is a Japanese-American race car driver/neurosurgeon/rock star/comic book hero who, with his rock 'n roll commandos, The Hong Kong Cavaliers, balances his time between saving lives, pushing the boundaries of science, troubleshooting for the President, and playing gigs in nightclubs. The film careens from one climax to another, scarcely allowing the viewer time to think (which, in a film like this, may be a GOOD thing!). Director W.D. Richter deftly keeps the tone light, although there is a heartbreaking death scene tossed in. Loaded with more imagination than any three films you can name, and a oddball sense of humor, to boot, 'The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai' is a wonderful, wacky triumph, that challenges you to toss aside preconceptions, and 'enjoy the ride'! I HIGHLY recommend it!

The premise is this, Buckaroo Banzai is a man of many talents, a Jack-of-all-trades, who assembles around him a team of scientists and adventurers who help him explore new frontiers and fight evil wherever it exists.Buckaroo Banzai is a personal favorite of mine. It's not in my top ten favorite films, but easily in my top thirty. It didn't start out that way, it's one of those movies that takes multiple viewings to really absorb it all, and thanks to HBO, I did. I don't know what drew me to it, maybe the Huey Lewis & The News look of its characters. Maybe it's the off-kilter, kooky soundtrack. Or maybe it's the great performances by it's ast of villains, which includes John Lithgow, Christopher Lloyd and Vincent Schiavelli. It could be the little things sprinkled throughout the story.What little things am I talking about? Well ... ...Peter Weller plays Banzai, the multi-talented hero, who is the center of the movie. It's Weller's that makes it seem like all the events going on seem like it's just an ordinary  day for him. Bad aliens from another dimension. Good aliens who threaten nuclear war. Torture slugs. Flying seashells. Yeah, that's real ordinary. ...John Lithgow is the film's chief badguy, who has the all best lines, all delivered with an outrageous Italian accent. ...Banzai is truly a national hero. He has divisions of Blue Blazer Irregulars all throughout the country, almost like a militia, but only taking what's good about militias(!). ...It's got a great Halloween connection. You've heard about Orson Welle's War of the Worlds dramacast on Oct.31, 1938, right? Y'know, the one that panicked America. Well, Across the Eighth Dimension tells you what Welles was really reporting. ...If your first name is John, you may be a Lectroid, the aliens in the film. It seems when the Lectroids first arrived on Earth, they thought John was some sort of title, so all the bad guys names begin with John....John Whorfin... John Yaya... John Small Berries... John O'Connor...John Parker... John Bigboote. ...Banzai's bandmates are all pretty cool, too. My favorite, Perfect Tommy, played by Lewis Smith. But they aren't all no-namers. Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum and Clancy Brown are all in the cast too. ...At the end of the film, a sequel is promised Buckaroo Banzai Against the World Crime League. It never appeared.

All other hero films (Tarzan, Superman, Batman, The Phantom, The Shadow, Doc Savage) already had their mythos firmly established in print not so with Buckaroo.  They had to start at ground zero and explain everything in as little time as possible while giving you the film's own story a very formidibal task.Then the money behind the pic got insulted.  He (whoever he is) felt that the theatrical release slammed him and was personally insulting that's why the film was in the theatres for all of a week or so.  No PR, no theatre run time miserable flop.I'm unapologetic I think the story is great.  An fantastic take on Orson Welle's War of the Worlds radio broadcast, a truly all-star cast, alien Rastafarians, the jet car, some pretty good blue screen work on the cobbled-together Lectroid ship, and true love triumphing over death itself, not to mention one of the coolest end title sequences I've ever seen!  (I will fault the lighting on the parachute sequence)I think it was quite commendable, and a film truly worthy of the cult status it has attained with the science fiction fans.  I attend San Diego ComiCon every year, and every year I see Banzai t-shirts for sale along with all sorts of other merchandise.I only hope that the Fox series pilot is accepted, broadcasted, and becomes a moderately successful series, as that would give me a slight chance of someday getting the movie on digital media.Tanno Banzai!

I didn't know what to make of it. I saw some kind of spaceship that looked like an over-sized reject from a Jaque Coustou undersea special, a suped up truck with fins and a rocket, a bunch of scenes and characters that were as eclectic as a Bon Jovi fan at a Fatboy's concert, and a strange yet memorable tune that you could whistle in your sleep.I of course speak of none other than Buckaroo Banzai across the 8th Dimension. A film I remember simply for the fact that it was a let down and a triumph all at once. A film made with a market of the wink- and-a-nod crowd in mind; i.e. folks who get the joke, or want to get the joke, or love being in on the joke and want to be part of the crowd that's in on the joke. It's the kind of film that plays to the I know what's going on crowd, who then laugh at the antics of characters frolicking across the big silver screen ... allegedly.The truth is it's just a simple silly and harmless film that tries to have fun. There's moments that are completely off the wall, and because they're so outlandish that you either buy into it and smirk (maybe even laugh), or you simply reject it out of hand as being bad because your brain refuses to digest the material being presented.It's that kind of a film.So, did I like it? Eh, I can't say I enjoyed it a whole lot when I first saw it. In fact I remember telling my friend in his Capri how much I detested the thing, and him reminding me how much I said I wanted to see it. Okay. Touche. He got me. I did want to see it. And when I did, hoping to see something really out there in terms of adventure, I got a veritable trip down fantasy lane. Yet at the same time I did begrudgingly smile at Buckaroo's entourage and their adventures and misadventures. And who could forget the likes of John Smallberries or John Yaya, or their employer; Yoyodyne Industries? I mean with an all star 80's cast, how could you go wrong? Again, you had to be in the right frame of mind to watch the thing ... and perhaps the right age; i.e. a teenager who thinks he knows everything about the world, and wants to see a film poke fun at all the values that have been spoon fed to him from previous cinematic offerings. That film is Buckaroo Banzai across the 8th Dimension.Buckaroo Banzai pokes fun at all of the adventure and sci-fi flicks that came out up to that time, and plays to the audience that thinks they know better than other audience members and even the film makers themselves as to what the film is really about. Okay. That means that the film is trying to make the target audience feel good by boosting the cleverness faction of their ego. Is that a bad thing? Only if you get hung up on the film and that general mindset. But even here the film pulls and pokes at the veneer of that kind of thinking, and turns what might have been a serious sci-fi adventure into a quirky rollick. Otherwise, like I said, the film is harmless. It ranges from good laughs to the absurd, and all colors of the cinematic spectrum in between.The actors do their job, the technical credits are solid, no miscues anywhere for anything, not even the script. A good solid Hollywood production.If you want to see something different, are feeling a little superior about movies to everyone else, have a hankerin for an adventure film about a super cool hero who's too cool to be real and has managed to coral the oddest bunch of characters under his tutelage and leadership, then give Buckaroo a chance.Otherwise, watch at your own risk.

I don't think half of the cast even know what it is. But I do know that I like it, a lot. It has a wonderfully infectious edge and does not care to conform to the expectations of any particular genre.Peter Weller is Buckaroo Banzai a Japanese/American rock star/brain surgeon/secret agent/rocket scientist who travels through the 8th dimension in his rocket car with the help of his latest invention - the Oscillation Overthruster. The success of this inter-dimensional travel brings forth the Rastafarian Black Lectoids, an alien race at war with the the Red Lectoids, led by a manic John Lithgow as Dr. Emilio Lizardo/Lord John Whorfin, who are already here on Earth and sabotaging Buckaroo and his very large easy-going entourage the Hong Kong Cavaliers.Honestly, there is so much going on here that it's very hard to get a handle on it. This also makes Buckaroo Banzai infinitely re- watchable. Imagine the insanity of Big Trouble in Little China and dial it all the way up past the threshold. It's incredible that I have only just discovered this film. Perhaps attempting to review it this soon after my mind has attempted to absorb it is a mistake. One could literally debate and discuss this crazy movie until the end of time and still not cover all of its idiosyncrasies. There is enough material in here for ten movies, yet it never once feels overly crowded, nor did it ever deliver the urgently-needed sequel the end credits promise. The film is PACKED with recognizable stars who debuted or were at there peak in the 80s. Christopher Lloyd and Dan Hedeya as the evil Red Lectoids, Jeff Goldblum as Buckaroo's new recruit, Ellen Barkin as the twin sister of his long-lost true love, Clancy Brown as his right- hand man, and a young Jonathan Banks (with hair).There are so many movies from the 80s that thrive on iconic imagery and eccentric creations. The Oscillation Overthruster really should be as well-known as the Flux Capacitor or the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man, the rocket car should be as recognizable as the DeLeorean, Buckaroo's style should be as popular as Marty's orange body-warmer or Indy's fedora. What really should have caught on with audiences the most is Buckaroo's caring, kind personality. It adds yet another unique layer to an already multi-layered and highly unique film.It's a shame that Buckaroo Banzai failed to find an audience when it was originally released but perhaps having it gradually find its way into popular culture and naturally pull curious viewers into its culture is better than being rudely shoved in our faces.

The closest movie I can compare it to is Big trouble in Little China or Monthy Python making fun of science fiction. It never takes itself to seriously. It's sort a joke on itself.What we have here is a pseudo science fiction comedy . All the science here is just one black joke &#x96; it's a parody of gibberish science you can find in many old movies. It's one of those love it or hate it movies. I don't think it's a masterpiece , but it's definitely not a piece of s*** that many IMDb reviewers call it.TAOBBATED is a movie you have to watch at least 2 times just to understand what the heck is going on. On repeated viewings you will be able to notice many small jokes you might have failed to notice . For example I didn't understood why Doctor Lizardo (the main villain) destroyed the arcade game until I've noticed on third watch it was BUCKAROO BANZAI arcade game ! TAOBBATED has a weird sense of humor &#x96;you either get it or don't get it. Some jokes don't really have a punch line (the watermelon) . Some are intelligent &#x96; instead of Green Berets we have Blue Blazers ! I love  the billboard The future begins tomorrow , the John something aliases , No matter where you go, there you are. , the coolest ending credits ever made.The cast is impressive with some future stars in it. Peter Weller (Robocop) gives a good performance as Buckaroo Banzai &#x96; modern Renaissance Man who is a rock musician/scientist/ neurosurgeon/action hero . He plays his character with dead-pan seriousness , which gives good comedic effect , considering all the crazy things going on. He breaks it few times (his subsequent detection of the sinister Red Lectroid agents , every scene with Penny). Ellen Barkin (Sea of love) is hot in every outfit she appears and she has great chemistry with Weller. Jeff Goldblum (The fly) is good as the mild mannered sheriff. Christopher Lloyd (Back to the future) is fun as the arrogant John Bigboote. The true star however is John Lithgow (Cliffhanger) as Doctor Lizardo, twisted fascist alien. I love his voice , his Italian accent , his facial expressions. He's a scene stealer with his over-the-top performance.The plot is quite innovative. Inter dimensional alien invasion theme in contrast to aliens from outer space which has since been overused many times feels very fresh. Screenplay by Earl Mac Rauch is full of dry humor and action. Director WD Richter obviously directed Buckaroo to be a cult movie. Music by Michael Boddicker is really good. Atmospheric and upbeat works well for this comic-book like adventure. I love the Buckaroo Banzai theme.The bad things ? The Hong Kong Cavaliers . With the exception of Jeff Goldblum they are rather bland characters . Not really interesting for the viewer , because the filmmakers never explored their personalities. This is a very low-budget movie. The Red Lectroid bivouac was actually an abandoned Firestone tire factory. It does look a bit dated with it's costumes and set designs. The dialogue sometimes can be incredibly heavy on the techno babble attempting to explain the science of the film. The love story isn't given all that much time to develop.A sequel was planned called Buckaroo Banzai against The World Crime League . A script written, but the funding did not appear after TAOBBATED bombed at the box office. The studio bankrupted . Too bad. I would love to see Evil Hanoi Xan (Buckaroo's arch-nemesis) and the cameo appearance of Jack Burton (Kurt Russell's hero from Big trouble in Little China) ! I gotta look for the DVD - Pinky Caruthers Unknown Facts is a commentary that explores the universe of the movie and explains few things (the watermelon).This is a fine example of 80's film-making.

All of these movies, if released today, would end up in art-film theaters or direct to video. I think it's clear that movies today are not as good as they once were.

These films were solely made with what was guaranteed high profit cool cgi effects, top names like Will Smith (who, in my opinion, should be banished from science fiction for eternity), and great merchandising at McDonald's.The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai is one of those crazy little gems that, sadly, fell through the cracks. The special effects are mediochre, the acting is strikingly individual, the story is chaotic and the concepts bizarre. I love it. This movie is a great example of the fun Hollywood could have if they'd just knock it off with the big egos and the loner chic.This film is intelligent-- perhaps too intelligent. It's humor is subtle. The cast is perfect. Jeff Goldblum should be proud of this movie, and not, for Heaven's sake, of Independence Day (what an arrogant wash of spit THAT was). Peter Weller will forever be the good Doctor Banzai in my eyes, instilling in his character the busy-body slick-haired style of the 80's that makes the film so good-humored. It's daring, bright and exuberant. And the closing credit sequence is, by far, the best in Hollywood (it rivals any Monty Python movie).Buckaroo Banzai is a cliched, campy, comic-book hash-mash of genuinely unique science fiction ideas. And it's one of the last REAL science fiction films.

These two films have the largest cult followings of any of the strange flicks we present on our page, and for a good reason. . . although I'm not quite sure what that is.Buckaroo is odd. Very odd. So odd that you might be rewinding at the beginning going, What the flippin' flapjack did I miss? You didn't miss anything, patient viewer, this movie is out to mess with your mind. I read once that the best way to explain this movie is to compare it to jumping in to the middle of a series of movies. You feel like this is Part 6 of something, since it doesn't start at the beginning. I like that explanation, so I'll leave it at that. You must have a blank, tabula rasa mind watching this. Just be a conformist accept what is happening and go with it! Buckaroo (Robocop, er, Peter Weller), a Jack-Of-All-Trades, is currently riding his rocket car into the 8th dimension, inhabited by bad dudes all named John. They come to earth and try to fight us, but Buckaroo and his Hong Kong Cavaliers are there to stop them. I feel so funky trying to explain this... it's like trying to explain a dream that really made deep sense to you while it was happening, but no one is really going to know what you are talking about in the morning And so, this snail gave me a hug, right, and said I was from the Land of the Lollipop People! Can you believe that?I personally didn't find this film as engrossing as other famous cult movies, but it wasn't bad. Just very disjointed and nonsensical. There are a lot of great, great lines, including the famous No matter where you go, there you are. Jeff Goldblum, Christopher Lloyd, and John Lithgow join the cast (I didn't even have to look up their names! I'm so proud of myself, > like when the giant snail came up to me...).

Richter's THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI is sort of hip, and kind of cool, but really isn't as good as it could be.It certainly starts out well enough. The opening credit graphics, and Music by Michael Boddicker, set a rousing tone for a grand, comic book style adventure.An opening story background crawl, ala Star Wars lets us know about Buckaroo, played by Peter Weller (Robocop), and his mixed background (U.S. father, Japanese mother) his varied interests (neurosurgery, martial arts, particle physics), and the fact that he makes music with his off beat friends, those hard rocking scientists, The Hong Kong Cavaliers.Without wasting time, Director Richter plunges into the action. At the salt flats, team Banzai prepares to launch its rocket car. The problem is, of' Buckaroo is not present and accounted for. That's 'cause multi-talented Buckaroo (Weller) is busy recruiting Jeff Goldblum (Jurassic Park), a top surgeon, who is performing an operation. After asking Goldblum to join his group, Weller inquires, Can you sing? Goldblum responds, A little... I can dance.Soon Weller, dressed in a black, Ninja-style firesuit shows up at the salt flats. When Weller gets in the jet car, the film really takes off, literally and figuratively. When Weller goes off course, it appears he's going to slam right into a mountain. Instead, a blue beam from the jet car zaps the mountain, and then the jet car goes into the mountain. Instead of crashing, it enters a weird 8th dimension. We see a strange landscape, and unusual creatures, some human-like, some not. Soon, Weller and his jet car come out the other side of the mountain, unharmed. In this sequence, Richter and Director of Photography, Fred J. Koenekamp, really delivers the Sci-Fi excitement goods. This is my favorite scene in the film.Unfortunately, the rest of the movie never again reaches this level of fun and entertainment. The rest of the film is a mishmash of aliens, a mad scientist (JohnCliffhanger Lithgow at his most excessive) and a lost soul girl named Penny, played by Ellen Barkin (Sea of Love) in an early, non-impressive performance.The main problems lie with the Screenplay by Earl Mac Rauch. His biggest mistake is that darn jet car sequence. The much acclaimed film Bullitt has its famous chase scene well into the film, which makes it all the more satisfying when it arrives. By contrast, THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI by having it's exciting jet car sequence first, gives filmmaker Richter nowhere to go but down.Another problem is the Hong Kong Cavaliers themselves. Other than Jeff Goldblum, they are a faceless lot, not very well fleshed out, and with little to do. Weller, as Buckaroo, is the whole show, and the rest seem like a Superstar's hangers on perhaps important to him, but not interesting to the viewer.THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI is like a Chinese dinner an hour later you're hungry for a more substantial film. All you remember is the opening jet car scene and the cool music.THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI should be watchable for both undemanding Sci-Fi fans and the small fry, who may get a kick out of the aliens.

Ellen Barkin's first appearance in the night club where her suicide attempt is misinterpreted as a assassination attempt is a example of the cynical detachment in which this film perceives life's unpredictable chain of events as either ironic or amusing. even the notion of particle physics seems intriguing but somehow funny.this film is also better sci fi than a lot would give it credit for. much of the sci fi that is offered up, especially these days on the Scyfy network, is neither realistic or probable speculation, i'm surprised at how grounded some of the science notions in 'Banzai' actually are. a lot of this film is typical 80's formula, aliens, evil villains, a cartoonish and matinée style approach to action sequences, and a reliance on big budget effects, but it's optimism about science and scientific research in undiscovered realms of existence and thinking, feels very much like the articles and covers of the 1980's popular sci fi magazine 'Omni'.mostly 'Banzai' is manufactured for silly fun. and that it certainly is. it is also one of the more off beat sci fi films from the 80's. too bad the film flopped and the studio never pursued a sequel like it had planned. 'Banzai' is a interesting, off beat character and it would be interesting to explore other dimensions with him and his cavaliers.

It's a cool title for a film. As soon as I first heard it, I decided that this was something I simply had to track down. Aside from possessing a title so long that I don't have the energy to repeat it in its entirety, 'Buckaroo Banzai' also sports a stellar line-up of instantly recognisable names Peter Weller, John Lithgow, Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum and Christopher Lloyd. You get the feeling that director W.D. Richter was attempting something in the vein of George Lucas' original 'Star Wars (1977).' He and writer Earl Mac Rauch basically created their own universe, filled it with wacky characters and developed a back-story to go with them, making this film seem as though it is merely one instalment in a series of Buckaroo Banzai adventures. Of course, success is based on a multitude of factors &#150; one of them luck &#150; and, unlike 'Star Wars,' this film performed abysmally at the box-office. However, with time, it has gradually found its niche audience, and this off-the-wall fantasy adventure has since developed a formidable cult following.Buckaroo Banzai (Peter Weller) is the ultimate science-fiction Renaissance Man, a skilled neurosurgeon, particle physicist, race car driver and rock star. When the sinister activities of inter-dimensional aliens called Red Lectroids (their leader played by John Lithgow) threaten to destroy the world, it is up to Banzai and his gang, the Hong Kong Cavaliers, to rescue the planet from total obliteration. Considering that 'Buckaroo Banzai' is only a single film, it's surprising how complex and richly-detailed the story is. Characters frequently reference events and people as though we experienced them in a previous adventure, and it all moves so quickly that you'd better be paying close attention to what is happening. Every character has their own unique and laughable quirks (Jeff Goldbum, for one, spends the entire film in a ridiculous cowboy costume) but it's all part of the cult appeal.Though I admit that I enjoyed watching the film, it didn't connect with me like I'd hoped it would. 'Buckaroo Banzai' strikes me as the sort of movie that I would admire today if only I'd first watched it in my younger years my unashamed love for such wacky 1980s sci-fis as 'Biggles (1986)' and 'Young Einstein (1988)' can serve as proof for this. Nevertheless, a sequel to 'Buckaroo Banzai' is a prospect that I would most certainly have looked forward to, since the film's universe is rich enough to have accommodated more than a few follow-ups, as well as a prequel or two. Indeed, though the end credits hailed the return of Buckaroo Banzai in 'Buckaroo Banzai Against the World Crime League,' the production company Sherwood Studios subsequently went bankrupt after the film's commercial failure, and legal complications destroyed any chances of a return. Oh, well. Perhaps there's a sequel floating about somewhere in the 8th dimension&#133; "},{"Title":"Why are people under 30 allowed into the cinema?","Date":"27 June 2007","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Romance","Review":" Get over yourselves.

I prefer movies that are just plain weird because because the director has a uniquely strange vision and that's the way they turned out e.g. the movies of Russ Meyer, David Lynch, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Ed Wood, Jess Franco, Walerian Borowczyk. There are a couple of exceptions I have a lot of time for - the Chiodo brothers 'Killer Klowns From Outer Space', and this one, 'The Adventures Of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension'. Some people absolutely adore this movie, others think it is one of the worst ever made. I fall somewhere in between. Every time I watch it I always slightly disappointed, as it never lives up to what it COULD have been, but there's enough good things about it to not make me regret having it in my collection. The best thing about the movie is the cast. Peter Weller stars as the super scientist/surgeon/rocker/all around good guy Buckaroo Banzai, and he may have appeared in some other forgettable movies but I have a soft spot for him because he was in two of my all time favourites, 'RoboCop' and 'Naked Lunch'. The rest of the cast includes lots of familiar faces and character actors - Jeff Goldblum, Ellen Barkin, Christopher Lloyd, Vincent Schiavelli, Clancy Brown, Dan Hedaya,etc.etc. John Lithgow really hams it up as Dr. Lizardo but it suits the material. I also got a kick out of seeing 'Quincy's sidekick Robert Ito, and a small cameo from Rosalind Cash from 'The Omega Man'. The one thing that really lets the movie down for me is the naff music. It should have been more like Devo and less like Eddie and The Cruisers.

The writing is superb, with gems dropped all along the way coming from virtually every character, even the nobodies.The stellar cast (pun intended) do not lord it over the lesser known actors, many of whom have pivotal and hilarious parts to play.The only predictable part of the movie is Jeff Goldblum, who ALWAYS plays himself.  But even he is funny in this modern-day version of Flash Gordon.There are so many great one-liners in this movie, you simply have to watch it to get them.  And it's fun, plain and simple.

The scene at the beginning where he attaches electrodes to his tongue & ears is pretty funny, but unfortunately there's not enough of that mugging in the rest of the movie which I'd suggest if given free rein he would've played to the hilt. As it is, he's still the most memorable and enjoyable character in the whole thing.There's something inimitably cheesy about the whole enterprise, but the parts are so downplayed as to give the viewer no interest in the characters whatsoever. Basically Buckaroo comes across as a bit of a wanker really. A 'dick' would be another apt description. Penny Pretty Annoying would be a better name for the token chick as well.There was supposed to be a sequel for this, but given it's box office perf that didn't eventuate.

A box-office flop when originally released in 1984, the film nonetheless drew a significant following on video and cable, even to the point where a television series was pitched a few years back. However, the flip side of being a cult hit is that there is a substantial portion of the audience that is mystified as to what that small group of followers sees in the original material. I find myself among the ranks of those who look at Buckaroo Banzai and say Huh? Nonsensical, lacking in energy or humor, Buckaroo Banzai is pretty much an exercise in strangeness for strangeness sake, and that just doesn't add up to an entertaining time at the movies.The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai focuses on the leader of an eccentric group of scientists/rock musicians, The Hong Kong Cavaliers, who travel throughout the country, play clubs and research particle physics as well. They carry weapons, drive around in a tour bus, and have a small army of volunteers, named the Blue Blazers. Buckaroo (Peter Weller) is a highly skilled neurosurgeon who gave up full time medical practice to engage in his eclectic lifestyle, and has, with the assistance of his surrogate father, Professor Hikita (Robert Ito), invented a jet car that can travel through solid matter by transposing to the Eighth Dimension. This is accomplished by a device known as the Oscillation Overthruster, designed by Hikita, which quickly becomes a much sought after item.It turns out that Hikita has been developing it since the '30s, where during an early experiment, his partner, Dr. Emilio Lizardo (John Lithgow), partially entered the Eighth Dimension and was possessed by a red Lectroid trapped there. He then managed to bring his fellow Lectroids to Earth, and upon learning of the successful test of the Overthruster, plans to use it to return to Planet 10, where his kind is from. Attempting to thwart this plan are black Lectroids, who team up with Buckaroo to fight Lizardo. At the same time, Buckaroo discovers the existence of Penny (Ellen Barkin) the twin sister of his dead wife, Peggy, which adds to his difficulties.If you can follow the above plot description, then congratulations, you may be able to decipher Buckaroo Banzai. However, the film's convoluted plotting will most likely prove off-putting to most audience members. In place of a coherent plot, Buckaroo Banzai would seem to want to jazz us with it's rather off-the-cuff, anything goes attitude, but it proves to create mostly indifference. The film wants to be a science fiction parody, theoretically sending up the genre, but it's difficult to determine exactly what it is parodying. A lot of the scenes attempt to be funny, but they fail to be. Screenwriter Earl Mac Rauch and director W.D. Richter have decided to treat this movie like darts tossed at a wall throw enough and something is going to stick. Yet, in the end, nothing really does, and the endless collection of disconnected ideas proves almost distracting, not fun.The characters are also rather non-existent. Few of them make much of a distinct impression; most are just surface glitter, distracting us with wackiness, while lacking much of a core underneath. Who really is Buckaroo Banzai, or any of his co-horts? Peter Weller turns in a performance that could best be described as indifferent, breezing through the movie with the same basic expression and even level of energy. Jeff Goldblum is entertaining as one of his sidekicks, dressing up as a cowboy, but there isn't much outside of the outfit. When a character close to Buckaroo dies, there isn't a tear to be found because we barely know him. Also, the relationship between Buckaroo and Penny is almost nonexistent, and there is no chemistry between them to speak of.On the villainous front, John Lithgow turns in an acid-addled performance as Lizardo, but again, it's just over the top weirdness that fails to be very engaging. The character is saddled with an Italian accent that makes dialogue difficult to decipher at times, but even when you can, it's just not funny. The rest of the villains are filled out with veteran character actors (Christopher Lloyd, Dan Hedaya, Vincent Schiavelli), but they are just random bodies in the background.There are countless individuals who worship at the throne of Buckaroo Banzai, and there are more than a few cult films that have proved to be enduring entertainment (W.D. Richter's next writing assignment, Big Trouble in Little China, among them). But Buckaroo Banzai does not pass muster, proving that occasionally cult status is not a good measure of quality.

I think it makes Peter Weller appealing, even arguably a bit sexy, which is an accomplishment in and of itself worthy of note. I liked most of the supporting performances and especially Jeff Goldblum, although I really don't think Ellen Barkin added much to the film.What I really liked were some of the random touches. Like the scene when these guys in suits are supposed to be some kind of alien investigators, and Vincent Schiavelli walks up with a huge glass pipe taking a toke talking about what a pleasant evening it is. I didn't even know they made pipes like that back in the 80s, sure never saw Cheech and Chong smoking one. Or the scene where the two guys are chasing after the aliens through the lab and one of them sees a watermelon on a table with a bunch of equipment and says, what's with the watermelon? and the other guy says, I'll tell you later but of course he never does. The opening scenes are good too, with Buckaroo Banzai doing laser brain surgery and then going right into a highly experimental vehicle and driving 500 MPH, then the next thing he's playing cheezy 80s guitar at some tacky neon club. It's hard to be enduringly cool if you're an 80s action character, but Buckaroo Banzai just manages to pass the test. A lot of the jokes in the movie pretty much fall flat, but you get the feeling that the people making it weren't even that serious about the comedy. It's just sort of a lark, one of the few self-conscious cult or midnight movies from the 80s that I've seen that I think really works and has its own special charm because it's not an imitation of anything else that I've seen.

Why? For starters, there are a lot of funny lines, and there are some very funny performances. John Lithgow deserves top honors, though, to be fair, he was given the greatest share of the wonderful lines--and does justice to all of them. It's a perfect antidote for a bad day, or week, and just writing about it makes me wish I had a copy handy. I thought that the deadpan style Peter Weller used was ideal; in part because he's such a great foil and in part because ludicrous dialogue is best delivered very dry and straight.

In this case, the ideas were all external, all designed to subvert and parody the genre, such parodies being a genre themselves.In both cases, the filmmaking was inept, and ruined the projects. Unlike the Pandorum case, all the value in this Buckaroo experiment is cinematic.Yes, there are all sorts of half-baked notions, but they are essentially visual. A device is to reference story lines outside the film, and that is done by cinematic devices. Some of the production design is pretty imaginative, and really cannot be appreciated unless you leave the film and browse the DVD extras. A few jokes are big misses, and most are clever but juvenile. Some, like the several Orson Welles references, the Rastafarian context and Yoyodyne are precious.

Creative details like a machine that recalls past times by attaching it to the tongue. And it has every little boy's inordinate dream; a kid who fights bad people while holding a gun WAW! It was rare to see a half Japanese heroic lead, or half Japanese anything good, in an American movie at the time. Thanks to not being Hollywood I think. Look at the way the American president is shown; so boldly ironic. It's one American movie from the 1980s that doesn't want to destroy Russia ! No need now to say how Earl Mac Rauch's script has so special atmosphere before being entertaining.The end's parade defines cool. It mirrors the team of heroes' confidence, variety and uniting. It's like the show's trademark at being simple and lovely. I love it as the movie's top product at all. After 20 years, Wes Anderson did it again yet poorly in (The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou) as homage to the '84 sci-fi comedy. Maybe the presence of (Jeff Goldblum), in both films, encouraged him. (Michael Boddicker)'s so 80s music with all the purely electronic tones and whistling, was childish and innocent. Plus it did fine concerning the identity of the movie as another 80s relic hip. A single sonic special effect, recurs in the music, tickles me since it accords with another one in a Japanese Atari game I used to play when I was a kid in the 1980s. I don't hear it ever since unless in Buckaroo Banzai.While it has fine merits that range between fresh, surprising, and nostalgic, the movie had to be willfully campy. Putting in mind how its director (W. D. Richter) co-produced it too (The no-money alert). Which leads us to different in a bad sense !Originally it wants to be comic book that tries to resemble cheap comic books yet cinematically. But maybe just resembling such a work isn't great thing to do, since it would appeal just for the die-hard, really crazy, fans of it. Further, the lack of money seduced the movie-makers to approach it as a spoof. However what's intentionally bad came off as eventually bad. So, it almost ends up as 2 movies  a sci-fi comic adventure, and the ugly parody of it; in a way that embarrassingly doesn't work.The horrible masks. The terrible special effects. And the glasses that must be wore to watch outer space's messages. They're all bad elements come from destitute production. The makers can't get away with it by alleging how their movie is a parody of the 1950's sci-fi movies or a spoof of the sci-fi novels. That poorness managed to deform any dazzling image, lessen the respect for the heroic core of it, making the mix desperately cheesy and unsatisfying (The being-a-flop alert !). So, for me this is unattractive cheese. And maybe the fans of the cheesy comic books themselves waited for more. And the other fans, who agreed with it anyway, were obviously less than making it a hit, only an exclusive classic over the years.(Peter Weller) looks agreeable, but mostly he just doesn't even try, to the extent of seeming soulless. Some reviewer said that Weller performed from the Zen zone, to be mistaken as stiff ! OK. That's fraud ! And although No matter where you go, there you are is from Confucius, but I still don't get its relation with the lead or the movie ! Singing The Skyliners' 1958 hit Since I Don't Have You is an exceptional moment. You can't find a moment as romantic as this in any sci-fi movie today. With that, singularity is something the movie, so worthwhile, wins.So, what's with the watermelon? is a smart idea as a spoof, not in a spoofing-structured movie though. It could have been so smart spoof as a whole, to be for sci-fi what Matt Helm was for James Bond. But the poor budget transformed it from a sci-fi mixed with comedy to more like a spoof of itself. Simply there is a difference between laughing at a genre and laughing at the viewers; while you sell them a poor movie as a mocking at the poor movies ! It is half wild, half bad. Whether as a sincere to the cheesy comics or a mocker at it; both ways I don't buy it. I can't imagine loving bad work, or loving bad work as homage to another bad work! And yet, the good points here force me to wait (Buckaroo Banzai vs. The World Crime League). I want the Hong Kong cavaliers to ride again, with bigger budget, and not the watermelon's secret; only more funny enigmas like it. Perhaps it'll be different AND wholly interesting this time.

For me one of these was Buckaroo Banzai, the name of which I knew but not much else. I have never seen it coming onto television or any other media that has easily come across my path so I made a point of getting it to watch it. The film is set up to be an exaggerated take on sci-fi adventure serials and in theory it is a good idea that should deliver fun albeit not in a way that will have you rolling with laughter but just in a rather silly way that works without undercutting the film as a whole. Throughout the film you can see this is what it is going for and, reading the comments of others, this appears to be what some have taken from it. Sadly for me it just didn't do the business.Perhaps part of it is the way that it has dated because now it seems very cheap and very limited in budget. This has the effect of making it seem a bit sillier than it is and it does limit the film for me. The plot is daffy, the casting has nothing but recognisable faces in it, the tone is exaggerated but yet I didn't think that it managed to create the right tone that would have allowed me to get into it in a sort of guilty pleasure way. It is quotable but it is not fun and in way having so many famous faces in it made it feel like everyone was in on a great joke that I was just not getting. Weller is solid in the lead but perhaps needed a bit more square jaw to him. Lithgow and Lloyd both ham it up really well to make their characters more lively and engaging than the rest of them. Barkin is OK, while Goldblum is good and at a point where his usual performance was not yet a pastiche of itself. The rest of the cast is like an endless parade of faces you will recognise and this does have a distracting effect that would not originally have been there &#x96; if anything for me it added to the feeling that lots of people were queuing up to do this film.Overall Buckaroo Banzai is known to me as a cult film and I can confirm that that is what it is. The tone of it just didn't work for me and I imagine the experience will be the same for many casual viewers. I can see the aspects that people say they love but for me it just didn't deliver in these ways. A definite curio film and I'm glad I watched it, but I'll probably be leaving it at that.

Peter Weller is a wooden hero surrounded by men with weird names and outfits who are going to help him save the world from aliens. There are two alien factions and I really do not want to investigate that any further as I stifle a yawn about to erupt. Weller and crew are lackluster with the exception of a very young Jeff Goldblum as New Jersey and a rather appealing Ellen Barkin as Buckaroo's former love's twin sister(?).

The attempt to do something that had not been done before. The chutzpah(?) the writers had to make their hero all of those things without any former knowledge by the audience OR an attempt to look into the background with any depth whatsoever. The set pieces, the costumes, and that hair are wonders even for the 80's!. John Lithgow chews up scenery better than almost anyone even though he wildly over-does it in this even by Lithgow standards. But with all that said, the end result ultimately was unsatisfactory. The inane dialog, the cheesy special effects, the wooden, low-key performances, that ludicrous end credits with people bobbing their heads up and down, and a convoluted story.

The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai is quirky, but its too random, disjointed, and unfunny to be worth watching.I get the sense they wanted to take Doc Savage and modernize him, fusing 30s style pulp fiction with 80s cinema in the way Raiders of the Lost Ark did for movie serials. And on paper, it sounds like it would be very cool. But it just doesn't work at all, and you have to see the film really to understand why.Stoic scientific badass main character?

A hilarious story crawl leaves you anticipating a delicious romp through the cliches of alien invasion films.

He plunges through the eighth dimension - and a mountain - and emerges unscathed, if shaken.But when it cuts to a pub scene where his band - Buckaroo Banzai and the Hong Kong Cavaliers - play, the movie slides. Uninteresting plot twists develop, eventually going up the wall and out of any reason, and production quality seems to lose a few notches. John Lithgow plays a mildly enthralling mad scientist, whom we never see enough of, and a young Jeff Goldblum plays a new recruit for the Hong Kong Cavaliers.The premise of Buckaroo Banzai is well-thought out, but it seems the script could have done with a rewrite or two - interestingly enough, the credited screenwriter's other films aren't that well received at all. The result? It feels like an '80s bomb.A sequel would be interesting - something as absurd as this can be taken any which way. But *this* one went the wrong way. 3/10.

The best part of this film are the trio of villains played expertly by John Lithgow, Christopher Lloyd and the late Vincent Schiavelli. These guys are awesome.

Especially not since they were even partially successful, depending on who you ask. You ask me, the movie failed.According to the IMDb, W.D. Richter has only directed one other movie, and it is comforting to know that he is aware of his shortcomings.It seems this was supposed to be an unusual, over-the-top science fiction movie, relying strongly on interesting characters and a subtle humor. And, yes, it was unusual. Over-the-top, too...but unfortunately not quite far enough to keep all of the audience awake. The characters...well...You can still grasp what they were meant to be like. It is possible to imagine an interesting story with these characters, given the room to display their depth and with a director who is better at storytelling. But in the given case, it is rather difficult to develop a caring for any of them, for what we mostly get to see are boring dialogs, completely at a loss of any emotion, and some cheesy action scenes, that I have seen children play with more suspense. There is no thrilling action and not any worthwhile performance. So what is there, other than a cheesy story?...Now, most of the people who disagree with me, seem to break the movie's fun-factor down to the incomparable humor it has. A humor so dry and ingenious that only the most imaginative and brilliant-minded people can comprehend it. (And those are, of course, only a select few that, as some people in the message board said, can only be found in the USA. I guess if I do not believe them, their nuclear scientist of a president is proof enough.) It is kind of strange that many, in the defense of this movie, are trying to sell their ability to laugh about it, as something special, like a gift, or a sign of genius. Well, yah, I assume that is how those people feel who are laughing about the cream-pie-into-face-joke...after hundreds of viewings, again and again. Discussing the quality of one's humor may be equally senseful as fighting over the best color, though...My impression was that the humor in Buckaroo Banzai wanted to be something special. But it turned out to be only blunt, due to the lack of passion that is evident at all times. Jokes that wanted to be witty left me with a sober aha-reaction, as the actors never seem to grasp what it is they are doing, or are supposed to represent. Most of the jokes were overly obvious, and when I did not laugh about them it was not my lack of understanding, but quite the contrary. I had the feeling of watching a cream-pie movie with robots as the main cast. Buckaroo Banzai can be very enjoyable for children. It must be fascinating for a child to see this weird scenario. And it seems likely that this joy sticks to you until adult-hood, like a fond memory. There are 2 actors in the movie who actually feel enjoyable to watch. Mood-wise, Jeff Goldblum and John Lithgow seemed to convey what the movie should have felt like slightly over the edge (Jeff) to outright crazy (John). John Lithgow is more convincing in 3rd Rock from the Sun...He eventually realized how strange his performance must have seemed in relation to the passionless acting of the remaining Buckaroo cast. Jeff Goldblum was, at that time, always fascinating to behold.Regarding Peter Weller...Well...You can tell why he was cast as the lead in Robocop, after seeing him play Buckaroo. It is somewhat similar to watching David Carradine (Kung Fu, the series)...Actually, I believe Kermit the frog has more facial expression than either of the two...and come to think of it, Kermit may have starred brilliantly as Buckaroo. Peter's faulty acting was probably desired by the director, though.If you ever liked Ellen Barkin, and you want to hold any respect for her, it might be a good idea to not watch this movie. That she received more roles after starring in this one, must be credited to her strong screen presence. Somehow you cannot take your eyes off her... And, oh my...in this movie, that was a really painful experience! She either was the strongest indicator for the inability of the director, or she took all of her acting classes after this movie! Actually, my bet is on the combination of both.There is no point in watching this to see Christopher Lloyd as he is mostly disguised (eventually he is glad about that, today) and hardly gets any chance to perform.My favorite scene was actually the end, which leaves the main troupe of heroes walking senselessly around a void but kind of weirdly beautiful area. They are just doing that, for a couple of minutes...and it was the only part of the movie I truly enjoyed! I recommend watching just these last 5 minutes (which are actually the credits, so this is not a spoiler, mind you)! But do not expect the rest of the movie to be this charismatic.

It was and is just plain freaking boring; no sense of charm or wit. The plot was ridiculous and so were the aliens (This film was made back in the 80's I suppose) and the performances. If this film is a comedy, then it seriously needs some work in the charisma department.

I was only a kid back in the 1980's when it was made, so I guess being a kid you like heroes in just about any movie, especially sci-fi. But even though there are great actors in the movie (John Lithgow, Jeff Goldblum) the script tears the movie apart so much that I could barely figure out what is going on. I guess the coolest part of the whole movie is when Banzai goes through the mountain and comes out the other side. It makes you imagine if aliens are actually in other dimensions here on Earth. But all that aside, the movie was like a 1960's sci-fi flick that people would see at a midnight theater. I am very surprised that there is still a cult following to this movie.

I could get into how the acting was more wooden than a national forest, now the director couldn't direct his way to the nearest gas station. how it was about as visually stimulating as a bad episode of Buck Rogers, but suck really encapsulates this movie. at least Peter Weller went on to do RoboCop, which wasn't excellent, but at least was a step up. Rating 2P.S. On the upside it did end.

There's nothing resembling a plot or a joke, the acting is appalling and the half hour I watched before saying words I wouldn't say in front of my mother and switching off contained no redeeming features whatsoever.Why is this film worse than Manos? Because Manos had no budget and no professionals involved, is why. Buckaroo Banzai is on par with Manos in virtually every department, except that its cast contains normally excellent actors like Peter Weller, Jeff Goldblum and Christopher Lloyd.If you die and go to hell, this film will be showing at the cinema. Avoid at all costs.

So what do I think? Well, compared with the other members of the pantheon of American comedy classics, this barely struggles to get off its knees.Previously I have fallen asleep part way through, but I just put htis down to tiredness. So I went to bed early, got a good 10 hours sleep, put it on at 1000 am, and found myself dropping off by 1100. That's it for me. I have heard others compare this tho the RHPS. Don't believe it. This is without doubt the worst movie I have ever seen. I did not give it a 1 because at least the 80's costumes were worth a titter for the first 2 minutes. After that, forget it.This film has no redeeming features. Worth watching if you can't get to sleep, but otherwise give it a miss.

In giving this unusually offbeat picture a second chance, I'd go back into viewing this thing trying to catch what I missed was fun. I admit I won't spend anymore time across the 8th Dimension suffering from paranoia. The big-name cast is pretty cool and the gags are laughable once in a while. By now, BUCKAROO BANZAI is a genuine cult classic, but why? Go back fifteen years ago when this was released in movie theaters and the word bomb comes to mind an unclassifiable science fiction film that didn't sell. Not my cup of tea here.

Of course, some people like mining for meaning.  If you have time to watch this movie more than once, you may find some meaning in it.  Otherwise, don't waste your evening.I tried.  I really tried to get the point, but the point (if it exists) was buried too deep for this archeologist.  Maybe if it had a better cast.  Maybe if they'd had a bigger budget, a better script writer a catchy plot, some computer graphics and had spent a more time working at it this could have reached cult film status.  In my opinion, it didn't even reach Ed Wood status.  With Ed Wood, you could at least laugh at the bungling attempt. This film didn't even attempt to attempt attempting.If you enjoy blowing up a balloon to let it go and watch it swirl around the room and then playing around with the over-stretched remains, this film is for you.

Some movies are bad enough they are unintentionally funny and hence watchable. Buckaroo Banzai... is not one of them. It tries to be a cute and funny spoof of B-grade sci-fi flicks but flops miserably. The laughs are few and scarce.I don't want to reveal any plot details but some of the references to other sci-fi movies are just plain tacky and it seems obvious (at least to this viewer) that the writers are trying too hard.There are tons of other truly funny spoof movies out there and the viewer would be much better off sticking to them. Doctor Strangelove, Airplane, Hot Shots (both parts), Naked Gun, heck even Mars Attacks is much more watchable. Watch anything else but steer clear of the drivel that is Buckaroo Banzai...

I never knew movies this terrible existed. The cheesy music, idiotic storyline, and terrible special effects make this one of the worst science fiction films to hit the screen. I apologize to any fans out there, but I have to put this film on my Hate list. I cannot describe the utter boredom that I felt. I actually had the inclination to rip my eyes out with my pen and to cut my ears off with my three-ring binder. If you find yourself at blockbuster and must choose between Buckaroo Banzai and Gigli, pick Gigli or come back later. Really, it's that bad.
