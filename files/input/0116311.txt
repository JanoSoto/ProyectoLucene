The movie doesn't aim at high quality. It's not meant to be. It is meant to be funny and entertaining. It is shallow and sometimes oversubscribed. However, I thought that a) Brock Pierce did a wonderful job, b) I could deduce some messages of life, c) the plot was nice and d) the interaction between Sinbad and Brock was rather substantial and well staged. Brock Pierce showed how lonesome and frustrating the life as the First Kid can be, how isolated he is and how much he suffers from this isolation. Sinbad - I mean, he is a clumsy guy, but he did fine in here. I never thought that he was constrained or fake. The movie as a whole lacks a realistic storyline, but that didn't matter to me. I was rather attracted by the scene in which Brock told him amid tears how outcast he felt, and I thought it was witty how Sinbad showed him what to do about it. Definitely not a masterpiece but surely above the average.

I love Sinbad and he is very funny in all of his movies such as this, Jingle All The Way, Houseguest, etc.; he's DA BOMB!!!!! LOL Anyway, it's about a kid who lived in the White House. No, he can't be qualified to run our country just yet, but still... Anyhow, he likes to get spy gear, talk with his buddy Mongoose_12, and use his pet snake to trick people into thinking he's doing homework and stuff...LOL Some parts range from serious (seeing one of the Home Improvement kids as a bully; watching the baked bean fly out of that bad guy's gun) to LOL (Laugh Out Loud) fun (the spit ball the size of ice cream!!!!!; the pizza/Coke mascot, etc.)!!!!!Anyways, I've seen this in the theater in 1996, and have seen this a lot on the old Disney Channel after that.

When the agent snaps from the strain in front of the First Lady, a new agent is assigned to Luke. He turns out to be the enormous Sam Simms (Sinbad), a bit of a rogue who managed to rise through the ranks by sheer determination rather than strict adherence to Secret Service protocol. Luke tries all his old tricks upon Sam. But instead of getting angry, Sam seems to actually understand and the two form a friendship. First Kid is usual Disney fare, but at least Sinbad was pretty funny in this one.

We ALL loved it and it leaves you with that feel good feeling that romantic comedies leave you with. It doesn't have all the violence that you see in today's movies on television but yet it hints at the cautions of the violence that kids need to be wary of so that it makes you think about it in terms of being cautious. It also hints at a little puppy-love with the thirteen year old kids. The phrases that they use are current so it makes the movie believable in today's times. It is just the right length and also ends very nicely. It's a great all-around movie that everyone can enjoy watching over and over again. I'd see it again and again because I liked it so much.

He works for the Secret Service in Washington D.C., and he hopes to one day guard the president. But now he was given his most dangerous and most challenging assignment yet--protecting the president's son 14-year-old Luke Davenport. Simms got the job when he performed the good deed of stopping Luke from showing his bare behind on TV at the mall. Simms was taking the place of Agent Woods, who was overjoyed to be rid of that kid.          Simms thinks this will be easy. But immediately Luke has him look after his 6ft long python, which ends up trashing a fancy party. Atschool, Luke is attacked by local bully Rob. Where was Simms? He was told by Luke to give him space. Simms feels Luke got what he deserved, but felt sorry for him later.         Luke is miserable with his life. He wants to be like a normal kid. The only outside friend he has is his Internet buddy, Mongoose12. Then one day, Simms offers to take Luke out and kind of show him what he's been missing. He teaches him how to box; Luke has his eye on a cute classmate, Katie. He and Simms tail her to her birthday party at a roller skating rink where Simms inadvertanly saves the day;       Luke wants to go to the school dance so Simms teaches him the moves, but when an unguarded duffel bag turns up outside the White House, head of Secret Service Morton forbids Luke to go, but he and Simms go anyway. The result Simms was fired and Luke was put under house arrest, but he escaped to go to the mall to meet Mongoose12, but unfortunately, he didn't know who this man really was. It was Agent Woods who goes completely psycho. But it's Simms to the rescue!        A very entertaining Disney movie. Everybody is good in it.Zachary Ty Bryan from Home Improvement is Rob. In an interview, Bryan said Rob wasn't really a bad guy. But we all saw that Rob was a non-caring, unfeeling, destructive boy, but then again I'm sure Bryan knows the character better than we do. So, If you're looking for a good family comedy, then I recommend First Kid!

But no, this is one of the good ones.  As a matter of fact, I'm surprised why it's getting such a low rating.Sam Simms (Sinbad) is hired to be the personal Secret Service agent of the President's son Luke Davenport (Brock Pierce), after the current agent got fired.  No wonder, too, because Luke is a pain in the neck who pulls all kinds of stunts and practical jokes - for fun or for attention? You'll find out.Sinbad and Brock Pierce work wonderfully together, and the scenes with the two of them are good.  The scenes with them and Dash (Blake Boyd) are even better.  I must say that I particularly liked Dash's (however brief) dancing outside the school hall - seem familiar? Oh, yes.They could have left out the kidnapping plot, but it does make for an interesting addition.A great movie. Worth the rental.

Sinbad plays secret agent Sam Simms assigned to protect the President's son. With his wild ties and sense of humour he attempts to win the boy over. After failing attempts he decides to teach the kid how to box, dance and ask out girls. The only thing he left out is teaching the screenwriter how to write a decent story. Simple plot travels formula with little or nothing original to be found. It is disturbing how the villain got to his current state. Director David Mickey Evans does what he can with the cardboard material but he is dealing with recycled nonsense. Sinbad is basically reduced to formula doing everything expected. Brock Pierce is hardly likable as the kid. In fact had he not been such a snot nose brat then none of this would have happened. Timothy Busfield plays a former bodyguard who is mistreated by this miserable brat. Blake Boyd provides no personality as the President. He is played by James Naughton and is the basic father who is absent but learns lessons of fatherhood by the conclusion. What a total crock. Film supposedly stresses the importance of good adult role models but comes off as a juvenile James Bond that should be locked away and never heard from again.

These comedies had a few things in common. They starred someone who was quite big on TV at the time, and a movie studio decided to give them a contract to star in some low budget movies to see how they'd do.The first one did OK business, then the other sank without a trace.Damon Wayans, Pauly Shore, Phil Hartman, Sinbad, and a few other actors were in these, and although they never really gained an audience here in the UK, I have to see every one of them, because they all have the same narrative structure to them.And here's the method of that narrative.We have our star, who has some sort of wacky trait. They are in close proximity to someone who doesn't like them very much. That attitude eventually changes. They bond and become friends. Something happens that cause this friendship to finish abruptly, either someone loses their job, or our hero has been double crossed.But rest assured, all will be good come the end, the hero will get the love interest, the the hero and main plot character will bond, and every one will laugh come the end.There is always an Obi Wan type character in the film, here it's Robert Guillame, and there is always someone who wants them to fail, here it's Art La Fleur, but guess what, he warms to him come the end.Sinbad is watchable enough he's likable, and the concept here is that he's assigned to look after the Presidents son, who's a little bit of a cheeky chappie, why, in the first scene, he gets a member of the Secret Service fired, I wonder where that plot goes too?So Sinbad teaches him how to box, how to talk to girls, and things are going smoothly, until the bond ends abruptly. Even though you know what's going to happen the minute the film starts, these are my kryptonite, I'll always go back to them, because they are so easy going.They are not brilliant by any means, m sometimes embarrassed to watch them with other people, but they are comfort movies, and so entires that's what you want a film to give you.

I happened to be on the Sky Disney Channel and this popped on, I hadn't seen it so I figured I would watch it. As soon as I saw the intro, I knew it was going to involve a kid who was either going to be really likable or really annoying...this kid was really annoying.In the first half of the film I felt that his old bodyguard was right to lose it at the shopping centre (or as you Americans call it the mall) since he was misbehaving and seemed to not gain that much punishment apart from a calm You're grounded from his parents. I was also on the side of the kid bullies and felt myself nodding when they said I don't think you're better than anyone and clapped when The First Kid got punched in the face, because all I saw was a bratty spoilt brat that didn't know when to stop and needed to learn a lesson. This was a major problem for me when watching this film and it still bugs me today as I have experienced kids like this before. However, on a more positive note, he was more likable in the second half of the film when he was learning how to be normal and such, though that's not saying much, I still find him one of the most annoying kids in movies.The best thing about this movie was the performance from Sinbad, as the newly hired bodyguard. His character made me giggle at every joke and none of them fell flat, could be because he's a comedian but still. He saved the movie for me because if he hadn't been a major character then I would have straight away changed the channel.Storywise, it was OK I suppose I mean the concept of the kid being lonely is believable enough, though I personally don't think acting bad would help him receive positive attention. Also, it would be only natural for him to want to make a friend online and meet up with them. I have to say that I was NOT expecting the old bodyguard to be the online friend at all, I thought it would have been a brand new villain that would have kidnapped him and held him for ransom or some generic thing like that.Overall, this movie is OK, if you can tolerate an extremely annoying brat for about 85% - 90% of the film then I would recommend giving it a look. If you can't then definitely skip it, it's not a total loss if you don't I'm just saying that you would be missing out on a great performance from Sinbad which is why this movie gets a 5/10 from me.

Sinbad and Timothy Busfield are both people who protests the first kid Luke Davenport (Brock Pierce) but not at the same time. And if you don't have time to go and visit the White House in person, the next best thing is to rent or buy this movie. Plus if you watch this movie you will see a lot of rooms in the White House than you would if you took a tour of the White House. As the movie opens, Luke Davenport is being rushed though breakfast by his Secret Service Guard Woods (Timothy Busfield). Luke has to do back to school shopping. But when Woods rudly takes Luke into the dressing room, Luke's mom (Lisa Eichhorn) decides that she no longer wants Woods procting her son, and Woods ends up fired. Right way Sam Simmons (Sinbad) gets the call in the mall. Where at the White House he learns that is has been picked to protect Luke Davenport than the president (James Naughton). Right away there are some problems, but Sam Simmons takes care of it. Zachery Ty Bryan appears as Luke's classmate and bully. And you know who has to go to school with him. That would be Sam Simmons (if you didn't know). But parents this movie has been rated PG by the MPAA. 10/10              "},{"Title":"You are not guarding the President...but his kid!","Date":"28 June 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Family, Comedy","Review":"  Comedian Sinbad plays a Secret Service agent that is assigned to protect and entertain the President's obnoxious, pain-in-the-butt 13-year-old son(Brock Pierce). Breaking rules and having fun seems to be priority with the affable agent and his charge. Timothy Busfield actually does the best acting in his small, but pivotal role. Also in the cast are Robert Guillaume, Lisa Eichhorn and Blake Boyd. It was not my choice or intention to watch; but found it humorous, childish and an escape. It helps to be a Sinbad fan to get maximum enjoyment. "}]
