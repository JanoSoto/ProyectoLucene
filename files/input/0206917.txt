[{"Title":"Grade B-","Date":"15 January 2005","Score":"63 out of 71 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Music, Romance","Review":" Christina Ricci sings more than she speaks in the movie, but she manages to hold your attention nevertheless for a pretty solid hour and a half in this well-acted and profound, but uneven period piece. Sally Potter, who also directed the similarly problematic Orlando, clearly has the visual and thematic talent to be a much better respected director than she is - she just needs to learn how to tell a story.The first forty minutes of the film, which begins in the year 1927, are absolutely masterful. The sublime Claudia Lander-Duke plays young Fegele, an impoverished Russian-Jewish girl whose beloved father decides to journey to America in search of a better life. After that, Fegele and her family are set upon by unnamed bad guys (probably either Cossacks or Communists), and Fegele is separated from them. She ends up on an ocean liner bound for England, where her name is changed to Susan, she is adopted by an English family that doesn't understand her, and she is forced to begin the process of assimilation.Flash forward ten years or so (Potter is regrettably and consistently unspecific about such things). Fegele (now Suzie and now played by Christina Ricci, she of the large, expressive eyes) wants to be a showgirl so she can earn money to go to America and find her father. She auditions and is accepted by a group based out of Paris. Once in Paris, she rooms and becomes tight with fellow showgirl Lola (Cate Blanchett), a somewhat vapid and materialistic creature with no ambition save that of landing a rich man - which she manages to do in the form of opera singer and Mussolini supporter Dante Dominio (John Turturro, in one of his better performances). Around the same time, Suzie meets and falls in love with Cesare (Johnny Depp), the leader of a band of gypsies.Once all the dominoes are in place, Potter wastes no time in knocking them down. You can see trouble coming a mile away Lola, Suzie's one confidant who is aware of her Jewish ancestry, begins falling under the emotional and political spell of anti-Semitic, gypsy-hating fascist Dante. Meanwhile, the Nazis have invaded Poland and, despite everyone's self-assured predictions that they'll stop there, the French border is neither geographically nor historically distant. Suddenly, it's a race against time for all involved, but especially for Suzie - will she stay behind with her gypsy king, or, given a choice, will she escape certain death? The problem with all of this is that it's all so familiar. Potter adds nothing to the old story. There are some wonderful messages in this film about multiculturalism, nationalism, and the sometimes subtle nature of fascism, but if you don't care about the story you're not going to be interested in listening to the messages. The gypsy subplot, for instance, seems tacked on, like it was an excuse to give Ricci a love interest and have him be played by Johnny Depp.The really interesting plot line here involves Lola and Dante, and I would pay ten dollars to see a movie that was just about them. Both Blanchett and Turturro create real, flesh-and-blood human beings, and it's in their scenes that Potter's writing really soars. Watching Dante sink deeper and deeper into a political philosophy fueled by his own insecurity while the irrepressibly optimistic Lola tries to turn a blind eye to it all is a fascinating and marvelous experience.Ricci gives a good performance too, although occasionally that Valley Girl tone she uses in most of the rest of her movies slips out a little too much here and there. Fortunately, Potter doesn't give the shy, quiet Suzie very much to say. Most of her acting is done with her eyes, and she's really quite good. Johnny Depp does what he can with Cesare, but there's only so much an actor can accomplish when playing a plot device.Art direction, music, and cinematography were all top-drawer. As is par for the course with Sally Potter's films, it looked good and had some interesting things to say. I just wish it had been more compelling.

However, this is one of those movies where there is no fast-paced, witty dialog, no car chases and no gratuitous sex. It is about the characters. Therefore, many will find its plot slow and dull. This movie was not made for mass appeal. Many will find it to be beautiful and meaningful, while others will not sit through the first half hour. With that said, I will now say how much I loved this movie. It was visually stunning, superbly acted and has a score to match. While I have always enjoyed Christina Ricci and found her to be quite attractive, I have never seen her look as beautiful as she does in this film. Cate Blanchett is as wonderful as she always is, proving once more she is one of today's most versatile and convincing actors. Johnny Depp and John Turturro are also both excellent in their roles. Overall, I would have to recommend this to anyone who enjoys good character development/superb acting.

At least it has now been played in several countries in Europe other than Italy (like England, Germany and France) and its score and screenplay are finally being sold by Amazon.co.uk.  (I'm hoping the VHS and DVD will soon be available also.)  I want to contribute to this movie's current rebirth by saying what I think makes it special and definitely worth seeing.The first thing that comes to my mind about THE MAN WHO CRIED is its formal visual beauty.  It is extremely well directed and there are many scenes that I regard to be among the most beautiful ever filmed.  Ms. Potter's talent as a film director is undeniable her style is a mixture of choreographic elegance and subtle sensuality.   I have never seen the camera move like it does in her pictures.  In ORLANDO and in THE MAN WHO CRIED alike, it has a way of chasing the characters on scene, of playing with them, of circling around them, that makes it seem like an animated being rather than a mechanical object.  It literally seems as if the camera dances with the characters it portrays!  None of the movies by other directors I've seen so far are 'written' in this same 'language.'  Ms. Potter's personal contribution to the renewal of the existing 'cinematographic grammar' shouldn't be underestimated.A second striking quality of THE MAN WHO CRIED is the music in it.  The director said that 'The intention was to find a way of telling the story where music was carrying emotional and spiritual truth with as much force as the images and the characters.'  By frequently reiterating a set of intensely powerful, culturally eloquent and evocative pieces &#150; among others, Purcell's Dido's Lament, Bizet's Je Crois Entendre Encore and instrumental pieces by Goliov &#150; which serve to remind the characters who they are and where they come from (besides giving the movie cohesion), she succeeds in this difficult task brilliantly.  (And courageously not many film directors, I believe, would dare to make a movie with four opera pieces constantly being sung!)  The idea that comes through is that when people are left without their cultural identity and/or dignity, music can save them for forgetting their 'Selves,' save them from silence and incommunicability.As far as the characters in THE MAN WHO CRIED are concerned, I think they are very well thought out and effectively depicted.  It is especially admirable that the director would decide to give life to a 'mute heroine,' Suzie-Fegele, who says almost nothing throughout the whole movie, but expresses herself surprisingly well in spite of this.  She conveys, with incredible force, that sense of inadequateness and discomfort so many are left with for life when they are put into a hostile environment during their childhood.  Cristina Ricci seems embarrassed at times, and rightly so, for in this movie she plays the part of an outcast, and that's the way an outcast often feels, unfortunately.  But there's also strength in her eyes, and determination, and, once again, rightly so, for despite all that fate has unjustly taken away from her, she has learned to go on, to look straight ahead and not ever give in, to live and not to let herself die.  Cate Blanchett is an exceptional actress and she performs wonderfully in this movie both her beauty and intelligent eyes were never this intense and captivating.  Johnny Depp is, as always, very talented and very handsome.As I said at the beginning of my review, this movie isn't quite as good as ORLANDO and THE TANGO LESSON (which were, in my opinion, two absolute masterpieces).  While those two movies were perfect from the very beginning to the very end, THE MAN WHO CRIED is perhaps a little uneven, in that along with many breathtaking and superb scenes there are a few instances in which something seems to be missing (overall I rate it 9/10).  Also, I personally would have preferred for it to be as multilingual as it was multicultural (then again, I know this probably would have made the movie even less popular).  Nonetheless I think THE MAN WHO CRIED has all the qualities of a good art product and I feel perhaps some haven't fully appreciated it because they weren't looking at it as one should look at 'poetry,' but rather as one normally looks at 'prose.'  There's so much entailed in it, that needs to be interpreted, as with poetry.  Sally Potter doesn't flaunt feelings, but they are there, and I guarantee they can stir you immensely if only you cooperate.  Every minute of THE MAN WHO CRIED (which I have seen three times already) gave me something special to think about and remember, and movies don't do that to me very often.  Consequently I think it would be a real pity for the public not to support this movie and its director.  I think Sally Potter is one of the very best film makers around and I hope our support and enthusiasm will persuade her to do even better next time!

There is a story of a Jewish girl's (Christina Ricci) journey in exile. We see in the beginning the little girl sharing enchanting Yiddish music with her father, sung in his beautiful voice. The father then leaves the family to seek his fortune in America. The girl in turn finds herself a refugee in England, given the name Suzie, grows up with some accomplishment in music and becomes a chorus girl with an opera group in Paris. As the threat of Nazism becomes imminent Suzie heads for America, finds her father in sickbed and, in fully circle, sings the Yiddish melody back to him.Johnny Depp's melancholy presence and Ricci's other-worldliness accompany the audience through a dreamlike journey, making them feel as if they are in a trance at times. Depp plays Cesar, Suzie's Gypsy lover. The scene where Suzie follows Cesar to his camp and gets introduced to his folks is very much detached from the rest of the movie, in a dream world where music is the universal language.And the movie is sustained throughout by sublime music presented sometime as part of the story, sometime as background, and often in a way that you can't tell which is which. E lucevan le stelle from Tosca, for example, first appears faintly as background music, and later comes back as the performance of opera star Dante Dominio (John Turturro, but with a dubbed singing voice). The music is very much an integral part of the overall charm of the movie.Visually, the movie is also like a dream, the height of which is the scene showing Depp riding on his white horse towards the Gypsy camp, with two friends riding on either side of him, and Suzie following at a distance on her bike, all this in the middle of Paris with the Eiffel Tower in plain sight.The only other thing the remains to be said is about Cate Blanchett, the actress with a thousand faces. The gold digger Lola she plays here is just as earthy as Galadriel is ethereal in Lord of the Rings. What a blessing it is to movie lovers that we have Ms Blanchett around.

I was shocked that I had never heard of it and purchased it for the $17.99 and took it home. Why I loved it many people have complained about the pace, but that is one of my favorite aspects of the film. It moves like a sensual waltz. It has a beautiful pulse that grabs onto you and lets the well exuded emotions of the characters seep into your mind like old sepia photographs that you want to stare at for hours. It is raw and full of multi-layered subtext. I loved the story. There was no censoring or trying to look pretty or appropriate. John, Johnny, Cate and Christina, as well as Harry Dean Stanton and Oleg Yankovsky were all lost in this film and only the characters they played appeared on the screen. So believable and well acted. I have read several comments about the lack of lines for Cesar (Depp's character) and I do not understand that. He spoke so much without needing to speak out loud, besides, it was Susie's story. Amazing cinematography and art direction. The artistic craftiness that was transferred onto the screen in this movie reminded me of a short film called An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge (based on short story by Ambrose Bierce. I saw it in a film class in college and then went back to my dorm room and painted for hours while listening to Mozart's Requiem and drinking red wine.

I would have loved to have seen more development leading up to the resolution of Susie's journey. But it certainly didn't mar the film for me, rather it  emphasized why 'The Man Who Cried' was so completely non-commercial and why it mystified and therefore angered the 'connect-the-dots' crowd.If you are in the mood for a beautiful, lyrical, non-linear poem-film, give this one a try.

Ricci and Depp, as impossible lovers who just happen to be members of the two peoples most persecuted by the Nazis (a Jew and a Gypsy), are both perfection in their roles. John Tuturro and Cate Blanchett, as (respectively) an Alpha-male Italian tenor enamored of Mussolini, and Suzie's fellow dancer/confidante seduced by the tenor and his Fascist tendencies, are such compelling characters that they almost needed their own separate movie. The cinematography is beautiful throughout, and the sense of history, of the sweep of time, is wonderfully evoked. Last but not least, the score of the film memorably weaves together an old Yiddish lullaby with Je crois entendre encore, the great tenor aria from Bizet's Pearl Fishers. Both melodies share the same rhythmic and harmonic skeleton, and the film score reveals and celebrates it. A wonderful musical reflection on the theme of the film in general.

Sometimes the whole world will hear that cry, but often it will fall on deaf ears.  `The Man Who Cried,' written and directed by Sally Potter, is just such a story, of a people-- Jews-- unimaginably persecuted and attempting to find their voice, that common expression of their suffering and turmoil.  And, as is wont to happen in extreme situations, that expression will manifest itself in terms that are universal and defy the barriers of language.  The `Man' in this story can be found in hu-MAN-ity, and his cry can be found in the common expression of song  In the aria of the opera, in the songs of the gypsies camping on the outskirts of Paris, or in the a capella intonations of a young Russia girl, a Jew, exiled from her home and adrift, alone, in a world of incomprehensible confusion.	The story begins in Russia, 1927; a man (Oleg Yankovsky) is forced to flee the country for America, leaving behind his young daughter, for whom he hopes to send later, once he is settled.  Very soon, however, the preadolescent girl is forced to leave, as well, and winds up alone in England, at a school, where she is given the name `Suzie,' and, being an outsider, suffers the taunts of her peers.  And through it all, what keeps Suzie (Christina Ricci) going, is the thought that some day she will be able to join her father (from whom she has not heard since his departure from Russia) in America.  In the meantime, Suzie finds solace in singing, while her personal odyssey eventually takes her to Paris (at a most inopportune time for a Jew), where she becomes involved with a dancer named Lola (Cate Blanchett), a renowned opera singer, Dante Dominio (John Turturro) and an enigmatic gypsy, Cesar (Johnny Depp).  Now a young woman, Suzie's dreams of America have diminished somewhat, but as the Nazi war machine begins cutting a swath across Europe, her thoughts, with renewed fervor, yet mingled with doubt, turn again to the possibility of joining her father in America.	As with her previous effort, `Orlando,' in 1993, Sally Potter had a definite vision of how to approach and present her story.  Unfortunately, she seems unable-- or unwilling-- to share that vision with her audience.  The story itself is interesting, if not original, but her disjointed, abstract methods of presenting it make it too obscure to embrace.  On the surface, what some may initially consider an imaginative rendering of the material dissolves under closer scrutiny, and the artistic, abstract presentation is revealed as nothing more nor less than the effects of awkward transitions that defeat the very vision Potter was attempting with this film.  The `transitions,' in fact, which are so vital to the telling of the story, are actually not so much transitions as they are lurches or jumps, which dramatically distorts the flow of the film.  Add to that the lack of character development or delineation, as well as Potter's inability to maintain any tension whatsoever, and the result is a film that is emotionally uninvolving and, at best, unapproachable from the standpoint of the audience.  Visually, it has it's moments, especially in the silent exchanges between Suzie and Cesar, but they are simply too few and far between to sustain any interest.  And it's unfortunate, because Potter had all the tools with which to work, but didn't know what to do with them.	The performances, too, suffer the same fate as the presentation of the film.  Ricci looks stunning-- very reminiscent of a young Elizabeth Taylor, in fact-- and her performance is the highlight of the film; Suzie, at least, is believable.  Ricci does well with the material she is given-- which isn't much-- and her lack of dialogue and extended moments of silence may mask, somewhat, the ambiguity of the character.  She is wonderfully expressive, however, which at least adds a touch of mystery to Suzie, who because of Potter's lack of attention is not nearly as sympathetic a character as she should be.  Ricci has developed a powerful screen presence, quite apparent though unemployed in this film, and hopefully in her next project she will have a director who knows how to use it.	Like Ricci, Cate Blanchett does the best she can with the material, but under Potter's unsteady hand Lola seems out of step with her environment, and despite Blanchett's best efforts comes across as more caricature than character.  She certainly tried, however, and attempted to get more out of Lola than was humanly possible.  A poorly written stereotype, there was nothing Blanchett could do to save herself, or the character, with this one.  	John Turturro suffers the same fate, only more so.  Without the necessary guidance, he seems to have a hard time immersing himself into Dante's skin.  It's a good effort, but Turturro as Dante is like putting a square peg in a round hole; he just doesn't fit.  And the singing voice provided for him defies credibility.  	Depp, as well, seems at odds with his character, Cesar, though he suits the part of the silent, brooding gypsy quite well.  Again, it's a case of being all dressed up with nowhere to go.  The character was not so much poorly written as too ambiguous; to be effective (as he could and should have been), Cesar simply needed some direction, and it was not there.	The supporting cast includes Harry Dean Stanton (Perlman), Hana Maria Pravda (Grandmother) and Claudia Lander-Duke as young Suzie (the best bit of casting in the film; very credible as a young Ricci).  The most positive thing that can be said of `The Man Who Cried' is that it had such potential.  Alas, it was never tapped; and you're left with the thought of what could have been.  I rate this one 4/10.

This is the story of the girl, who flees, with some luck, to England, and then as a young woman to Paris, seemingly in search of her father. But she is delayed there long enough to be involved in an acting troupe, falls in love with a gypsy horseman, watches Paris fall to the Nazis, and escapes to America, at last, to find her father.How in the world could this go wrong? There are even three truly stellar actors in lead roles Cate Blanchett (as a Russian expatriate dancer in Paris), Johnny Depp (the Gypsy, of course), and John Turturro (an Italian opera singer, well done!). And the photography, by French cinematographer Sacha Vierny in her last film, and the production design, by Carlos Conte, who worked on Kite Runner and Motorcycle Diaries, among recent films, are terrific, almost self-sustaining.But somehow it is slow going stuff. It isn't lyrical, some voyage through disaster and beauty, and it even avoids sympathy for many of the characters, who naturally fall to one fate or another in this topsy turvy environment. Partly it's the script--there is little said, and very little said of interest, probing or fascinating or moving. And it's been said before, of course--the story, taken in its broadest sense, is that familiar terrible story that needs retelling, but with greater intensity and respect. Again, it looks good on paper.So, director Sally Potter is in charge here, and she wrote it, too. I really liked the surprise and invention of Orlando, which she directed, but that, too, was flawed, and it's probably her best film. The rest of her resume, that I've seen or heard about, is paltry stuff. So watch this knowing it has the chops, the goods, and the best of intentions, but it will only feel amazing in small parts, which never quite get rolling into a meaningful whole, including the calculated and inevitable tear-jerking end.

Sally Potter wrote and directed this homage to the effects of WW II on Europe and in doing so created some memorable characters and deft images that linger.1927, Russia, and a Yiddish singer father (Oleg Yankovsky) sings to his beloved daughter, knowing of the impending gloom that seethes over Russia. With his family's interests at heart he flees to America, and encourages his daughter Suzie (Christina Ricci) to follow. Politics knock and Suzie's attempts to join her father results in her landing in England where she is accepted as a foster child by an English couple who try fervently to rid Suzie of her Jewishness for her protection.Time passes and Suzie moves to Paris to earn money as a singer. She meets fellow Russian ex-pat Lola (Cate Blanchett) and the two sing in a Parisian theater until they are invited to join the chorus of an opera company headed by Felix Perlman (Harry Dean Stanton) and starring the famous Italian (fascist) tenor Dante Dominio (John Turturro). Suzie encounters a gypsy Cesar (Johnny Depp) and falls in love. With the advance of the Nazi troops toward Paris, the opera company fragments, the threat of Jewish and gypsy annihilation becomes a potent force, and Suzie and Lola manage to book passage on a boat to America. In America she searches for her father only to find him advanced in years, with a new family in tow, and critically ill. The full circle of the man who cried comes in the quiet of the hospital room, echoing songs of happier times.Sound sappy?

The actors are solid (the range of accents demonstrates a lot of coaching) and some are outstanding Cate Blanchett, John Turturro, Johnny Depp, and Christina Ricci in her most sensitive role to date. The music is a mélange of Yiddish songs, operatic arias and original score by the highly regarded serious composer Osvaldo Golijov!

I personally found it very refreshing that all the horrors of those times were not flung at the viewer at their graphic and horrific details, but were just glimpses, that said everything if you knew what they were about. Why Figele's farther left Russia? And who wants to live in the world where your village can be burned down overnight? Why she was portrayed as so shy and not saying much? And how would you feel if all your life you were hiding what you are and by that fact you couldn't fit in? Why did she hide it? And who'd want to be a Jew at that time? Why if she was so shy she followed Cesar and sang to the Gypsies? Because first of all shy people are not devoid of impulses. Because she could fit in and open up to the outcasts as she could not to anybody esle - they didn't judge her, they simply accepted her. Being a Jew and Russian and shy at a certain period in my life I found what Suzie went through quite realistic. And I really liked the way Ricci played a girl coming into her womanhood. Yes, to a person used to Hollywood action and dialog packed movies that would be a slow and probably boring picture. So,if you are one of those people - don't watch it and waste your time. In a completely Hollywood movie the scene when the ship is bombed would have taken 10 minutes longer. What happened to Lola? And do you think she could survive in a swimming pool on a sinking ship? In that double trap where nobody would rescue her?This movie as I understand it is mainly about loneliness. For me, the movie about such a subject should not contain many words - the ones that were there, were quite enough. The actors cast was superb. As for the ending - not too far from truth,since Jews of similar backgrounds did faund several Hollywood companies. Overall, I would recommend this film, but definitely not to everyone - don't watch it if you expect action or long dialogs.

And yet the performances by the all-star cast are uniformly good. Johnny Depp shows the substantial range of his powers in a role in which he says nothing for like the first half-hour he's on camera, and he's got maybe five lines in the whole movie. Instead, he communicates everything--and it's a lot--with just a look, a touch, a smile. Cate Blanchett is equally good as the gold-digging Russian dancer hoping to sleep her way out of poverty. John Turturro shows he's capable of pulling off something more than unlikable geek roles as the suave but ultimately evil Italian opera singer. Christina Ricci is the only actor who looks out of place in the movie's 1940 Paris milieu, but again she delivers the smoldering performance that's expected of her here.So what's wrong with this picture? First, the movie takes way too long to set up its premise Ricci is a Russian Jew working in Paris to raise money so she can track down her father, who emigrated to America years earlier. Next, there's just not a lot of story here--and what there is doesn't make much sense. Why, for example, do the main characters continue to hang around Paris when everybody else in the city seems to have fled and the Germans have taken over? Then there are loose ends What happens to the Blanchett character, who is swimming in the pool aboard an ocean liner when the ship is apparently attacked by German dive bombers? Then, when the Ricci character finally traces what happened to her father in America, the answer is too preposterous to give the film's ending any plausible meaning.The Man Who Cried looks like a movie that can deliver the goods--great scenery, captivating music, a top-notch cast--but the whole just never quite adds up to the sum of its parts.

She'll be remembered for Orlando, starring the marvellous Tilda Swinton &#150; but still, The Man Who Cried has moments of beauty and flashes of brilliance that make it well worth a look. It's messy, patchy, but has intense visual presence, and some memorable scenes.The casting shows clout for an art-house director &#150; Christina Ricci, Cate Blanchett, Johnny Depp, John Turturro, and so on. But greatest praise goes to Oleg Yankovsky as Ricci's father, and the luminous Claudia Lander-Duke, playing his daughter as a child, cast adrift in the world, yet with a stately inscrutability quite beyond her years.The visual tone is sumptuous, well matched by music which doesn't simply exist outside of the film, but is woven into its very texture. Potter is on surest ground in the worlds of music, dance, theatre, with vivid imagery and impressive tableaux. Her dialogue not so great. Thankfully Ricci's Susie is more likely to sing than to talk she is our ears and eyes in a journey through an unsafe, lonely world of the 30s and 40s, and her remarkable face speaks eloquently of sadness and ennui, loss and damage. Depp reprises his now patented gypsy/pirate/outcast role, sidelined as a character, but adding much needed sex appeal. He becomes just another adventure for Susie, emerging and receding from the gloom in a slow dance - but elegant and handsome, like the film. I'll not forget the scenes of a man dancing in a Parisian café; or Ricci singing, dirge-like, on a doomed liner. I'd like to forget Depp at the climax of his romantic brush with Ricci, riding pointless circles around her on a white horse in slow motion, like something out of a 1980s Kate Bush video.Not one of the greats; but with glimpses of something altogether better. Still, I'd rather see an odd, flawed gem, than a ploddingly efficient, unoriginal work, showing little imagination or passion.

The Man Who Cried is about a young Jewish girl living in Russia in the late twenties who has to flee her home country and eventually ends up in Paris as a young adult just before the onset of World War II. She gets involved with a cabaret showgirl played by Cate Blanchett, an Italian opera singer played by John Turturro and a gypsy man played by Johnny Depp. I found the movie slow-moving but not boring. It had a certain melancholy to it where almost everything was restrained and understated. There are dramatic moments but no big melodrama which honestly I kinda missed. I wasn't particularly touched nor did I cry or even get teary-eyed. Your own mileage might vary, but I don't think it's a big tear-jerker.There's a lot of music (mostly opera but not usually the bombastic cliché kind) in this film with two important recurring songs. They're quite beautiful especially the french song Je crois entendre encore which weirdly I didn't recognize as French despite it being my native language. The songs are important because they often convey the emotions felt instead of words. It doesn't really matter that you don't understand the words. As an historical drama, it mostly skirts big events, mostly focusing on their effects on our characters from different nationalities. You need some minimal historical background to get what is happening. The whole first part with the exile of the little girl was pretty gripping. She seemed so small and vulnerable. The romantic aspect was two-fold. The relationship between Cate Blanchett and John Turturro's characters was very interesting but not romantic. The relationship between Christina Ricci and Johnny Depp's characters was less interesting but more romantic.Johnny Depp doesn't say much but his presence is felt. He was born to play sexy gypsy men and I suspect most women will swoon over him ;) The other performances were fine with the stand-out being Cate Blanchett as a somewhat superficial Russian dancer trying to marry into richness. The songs were mostly lip-synched. I think they were done very well but still it disturbed somewhat my suspension of disbelief. In conclusion, I liked watching it, it was well made with strong actors but the story could have been told a little better to engage the viewer more emotionally. It didn't strike me as particularly memorable or as the highlight of any of these actor's resumes.Rating 6.5 out of 10 (good) "},{"Title":"All star cast with an all star story- what more could you want?","Date":"6 October 2002","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Music, Romance","Review":"  I was in San Francisco and decided to see an artsy film.

The fabulous cinematography by Sacha Vierny serves the movie well.

It will take the whole film to have father and daughter reunited once again.Christina Ricci is, in our humble opinion, sadly miscast in the film. By having her sing, Ms. Potter makes a blunder, because Ms. Ricci can't carry a tune. Why not have her lip-sync like Mr. Turturro does whenever he is seen in an opera, or belting a Neapolitan song for his friends? Ms. Ricci, a good actress, otherwise, is not as effective here as in other films.Cate Blanchett fares much better with her Russian Lola. Ms. Blanchett makes a great contribution to the film, and she makes Ms. Ricci pale, in comparison. Ms. Blanchett gives a fantastic performance in the film. John Turturro is also excellent in the movie.

The only thing we can think it must have been Ms. Potter's direction, because Mr. Depp is a great actor who is usually effective in whatever role he plays. Also, we wonder why did Ms. Potter insist in having Cesar and his horse in all the operas one sees staged.

Each piece is deep and moving and adds richness to the film. Unfortunately, the cast does not quite deliver as well. Ricci gives a valiant performance as the heroine; however, her accent slips noticeably many times, detracting from the authenticity. The filmmaker would have done well to go with a British actress instead.Depp's talent as a character actor was wasted in this film. As a love interest he was rather cold and aloof; there was a distinct lack of chemistry between him and Ricci. The problem wasn't that his character had relatively few lines, but that combined with few actions aside from some equestrian stunts led for a wooden performance from Depp, through no fault of his own. Unlike the wide range of body language he was allowed in Benny and Joon, this uninspired role gave him no chance to shine.In contrast, Turturro does an excellent job of portraying the talented, but arrogant and snobby Dante. His singing voice (I assume it was not dubbed)is captivating and unparralleled. Likewise, Blanchett delivered a believable performance as the likable but misguided Lola, and engages the audience in alternately being disappointed in and feeling sorry for her.

The Man Who Cried is about a young Jewish girl named Suzie (played by Christina Ricci who I am a fan of) during World War II, she basically gets separated from her father and then becomes a dancer in England. Then she starts working in a theatre, where she meets Lola (Cate Blanchett), a Russian lady who becomes her roommate and close friend. Suzie then falls in love with Cesar (awesome actor Johnny Depp). The film basically follows their relationship as well as her relationship with Lola, I am surprised more people have not seen this movie based on all the star power in it, Ricci and Depp are both awesome and Blanchett is also good as usual, I would recommend that anyone see this movie but children probably should only see it with their parents permission.

Christina Ricci does well with little dialogue and so does Johnny Depp, whose role was made for him.The themes of the movie are classic and heart wrenching  loss, song, family, poverty, finding your identity and being true to yourself in an unstable world.

I kept waiting for her to ditch that dumpy hair style and start belting out songs.  After all, she's supposed to be gorgeous and a chanteuse to boot.  Frankly, I think young Ricci has some killer eyes and hints at disarming vulnerability but it's sad to see her so out of place here and it's almost laughable how when she lifts her skirts to show off her supposedly great legs the director has to go to long shot.  Her singing isn't very convincing either.  That's no big sin but her character's voice is supposed to be exceptional enough to lift her above the childhood crowd and even wow the big singing star himself.  Her singing here wouldn't land her a solo in your average high school choir.  I kept thinking, Is that her real voice?  If it is, why didn't they hire a real singer and dub it?  If it isn't, why didn't they hire a decent singer for her?  I kept hoping Blanchett and Depp would leave their dumb partners and run off together.  Now that coupling would have been worth watching.   "},{"Title":"Good, but...","Date":"3 February 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Music, Romance","Review":"  The Man Who Cried is a really fine film, better than most what Hollywood produces, but the film has some serious problems; or let's say one big problem the screenplay.The Characters, except the man who cried, are all well drawn and the story successfully fits in the historical events. However the film's ambition is much bigger than what it finally is. Nice title for a film, I have to admit, 'the man who cried', but when I reached the point in the film where this wonderful title is 'explained', I said to myself 'Hey, this can't be it! Too lousy!'. Really the man is 'only' crying because his lover has to leave and some of his family members were killed (ok it's worth a weep or two, but not when you have such a great title!). The scene last about seconds and that was it. We see the man never again. The man isn't even the main character of the film. A better title would have been 'the woman who sang' or so, since this singer on the search for her father is the leading character. But this is still only the title and it wouldn't be correct to condemn the whole screenplay for it. As I said the characters (except our man...) and historical facts are really well written and the story gives good surface; but only surface. The film evolves much too fast for its plot. There are just too many characters and things happening to be well described in a 100 minutes. The man who cried is one character that is sacrificed to this tempo, his screen time is not long enough and he barely speaks. He remains mysterious you might say, but he stays that much mysterious in this film that he seems empty.Nevertheless this film is quite good and is worth watching twice. Even though the writer and the director are the same person, Sally Potter, the directing is really fine. Mrs. Potter's camera is always moving, it almost dances with the characters you might say (Potter is a dancer and made some films about dancing, remember 'The Tango Lesson'). The cinematography Potter is using is eye-popping, inspired by photographs of Paris in the 1930s it has a 'classic' look. But Potter combines this with intense modern colors, Lola's red lips will haunt you after watching the film. The musical score is haunting as well, I guess that is always so with Potter's movies. As an actor director Potter is more ambiguous; Cate Blanchett delivers her best performance I have witnessed, and John Turturro is at the same time hilarious, scaring and sad and totally startling, Johnny Depp is fine as always, but he is the man who cried and so the screenplay ruins his character's possible depth, but Christina Ricci, who generally is a fine actress, somehow seems to be doing but playing back her text lines, maybe this was wanted, but I found it bad. The editing was well done as well.Now a bit more about the actors, because them (and the cinematography and the music) are the most haunting of the film. Cate Blanchett is absolutely great; her Russian/French accent his stunning, her red lips haunting, and she just became this Lola. Her character is the one the screenplay probably best drew, and she made it even better. When the sad but ambitious Lola, who is dating one rich men after the other (in the film only two of them however), is smiling, it catches your breath, I swear. John Turturro as the rich and unscrupulous Italian Tenor is riveting as well. His character, who had the risk to become stereotypical, is made alive by Turturro. He got the right accent (probably because he is Italian) and his face (this big eyes and crooked mouth) are making him scaring, but his shivers and his voice make him sad and as always Turturro makes his character funny as well, but very subtle always. Mind-blowing. Johnny Depp is doing his best to save the man who cried, but the man is just not long enough in the film. Depp takes his usual risks and assimilates the character the best way he can. As always then he just got the looks for this man. Now Ricci was disappointing in this film. Don't know why, but somehow she seems always to be thinking about something else and her dialogue doesn't seem natural. Generally Depp/Ricci works fine, but here it doesn't, and it isn't Depp's fault. It is I guess only a lapse of Ricci and I guess in her next movies she will be acting fine again as we are used to.Overall I recommend this film, but it is just sad about the screenplay's lacks, for this movie could have been that much better with a better script. Watch it twice for Blanchett/Torturro, the cinematography and the dancing camera and the score.

The subject matter of THE MAN WHO CRIED is more of the stuff of Hollywood drama, yet Potter treats the film with equal sensitivity, keen sensibility and attention to detail in every respect of the production music (there's a lot of it, including operatic recitals); cinematography (challenging with shots of fire and water a-mixed, and underwater captures); set decoration, costumes, art direction that cover snowy rural Russia to enchanting city of Paris, to stage production scenarios to Gypsy camp grounds, and more; special effects, visual effects, sound effects, and stunts; a fantastic ensemble cast with impeccable collaboration. Already twice worked together before, Ricci and Depp appear comfortable side by side as a pair of war-torn lovers with diverse backgrounds. Yes, it's a perfect Hollywood romance, an engaging tearjerker of a tale with singing, dancing and magical moments, too. Streets of Paris will feel different after a visual fête of three Romanies performing on three galloping horses! The film's French title is Les larmes d'un homme = the tears of a man. The man who teared can very well be Fegele's (Suzie's childhood 1927 Russian name) father, yet definitely would also mean Suzie's Romany (Gypsy) bosom friend Cesar portrayed by Johnny Depp. As always, Depp didn't have to say much, a glance from his eyes and a turn of his head conveys enough emotions. Suzie is sensitively delivered by a thinner looking Christina Ricci - at first glance you might doubt if the lean face a-singing is that of hers. With Potter's poignant love story - this is definitely a more mature role that included intimate scenes - Ricci's no longer the pudgy-looking teenage Wendy from The Ice Storm 1997, she is more demure than the brash Dedee in The Opposite of Sex 1998. Being a revue dancer in Paris, she actually gets to look glamourous in THE MAN WHO CRIED, along with Cate Blanchett who's Lola, Suzie's roommate and companion from the same dance troupe. Blanchett's performance reminds me of Meryl Streep in Sophie's Choice, a delicate sophistication and accent, Cate holds her own delivering a Lola we empathize through her reveled past flashes, and felt her suppressed sorrow within. Tuturro is Tuturro, emphatic in his role of Dante the arrogant Italian maestro. Due credit to Claudia Lander-Duke as the very young Fegele - her radiant smile and expressive face and singing voice truly capture attention.If you feel like a dose of nostalgic drama with wonderful performances, try Sally Potter's The Man Who Cried.

Short scenes, almost without any words (except some short dialogues in Yiddish) show how a little Jewish-Russian girl gets to England (where she is called Suzie) although she is supposed to follow her father to America. More than one question remains unanswered during these scenes but strangely enough that doesn't matter. Those sequences resemble fragments which seem to emerge right from Suzie's childhood memory Crucial moments are kept in mind, not everything can be understood by a kid. The main part of the film portrays Suzie's life as a singer and dancer at an opera house in Paris and her love to a Gypsy horseman (Johnny Depp). Christina Ricci (more beautiful than ever before) is great in her role as Suzie Her minimal yet intense acting successfully keeps the viewer's attention on her face.But unfortunately the film suffers from a couple of logical mistakes (just to mention one of them Why is one of the subordinate characters arrested before the Germans have reached Paris?). Furthermore, in my opinion the Nazi threat to the Jews as well as to the Gypsies is depicted in a far too superficial way. Yet the sudden but touching end of the film compensates for some of those weaknesses. On the whole, I have rated this film 7 out of 10.

Wherever you place the blame, it would be unfair to place it all on the actors.  Christina Ricci does well in her element see *Opposite of Sex* and *Buffalo 66* (unfortunately the actress playing her character's younger self in *The Man Who Cried*, Claudia Lander-Duke, did a better job).  Johnny Depp should not play a supporting role.  He needs to have the extra time on screen for us to get past his handsome face and pursed lips to see that he's a real actor, as was better achieved in *Gilbert Grape* and *Dead Man*, to name two (c'mon, he was better in *21 Jumpstreet*!).  John Turturro and Cate Blanchett did their best with the poor script.  I'm left wondering how any of these high profile actors and actresses were convinced to do this movie.  High-sounding speeches about the current times (brink of the 2nd world war) seemed forced into already emotionally faltering scenes.  The historic grandiosity of the movie overshot character development and we're left with a patchwork from many other better period piece films.  Our natural instinct is to blame the actors, because that's who we see subjecting us to horrible turns of phrase and overly stereotypical character portrayals and downright goofy eye play (such eye play, unbearable to watch, constituted Ricci's and Depp's dialogue for the first quarter of the movie).  But it's fairly obvious, if you look at the same actors' work elsewhere, that writing and/or directing is the culprit, and this points the finger at Sally Potter, since she did both.  But I'm compelled to jump to her defense as well, since *Orlando* and her (still somewhat annoying, but much more convincing) *The Tango Lesson* were better.  In any case, don't blame only the actors, and let's hope everyone involved has come to realize that, despite a few good lines and moments (Turturro's Italian character prays for God to let the Germans win, thinking it would be better for his operatic career), this movie is a step in the wrong direction in all their careers.

I have not had such a cathartic weepfest since Joan Crawford and Sylvia Sidney retired. Briefly, the film is a picaresque tale of a young Jewish girl displaced when her Russian village is swept up in a pogrom, who finds herself evacuated to England and raised by a well meaning but coldly reserved English Christian couple.  She is sent to school in England and bullied until a Welsh teacher hears her lovely singing voice (which is a loose end as she appears to have lost her talent when she grows up).  She joins a cabaret, posing to music, where the girls supplement their income with rich lovers.  While in Paris she somehow transfers to a vagabond opera company.  This is where the film really goes off track.  On it goes, one misadventure after another until she finally gets to America.   I would have given this film a perfect 10, except for the fact that it becomes unravelled in a mess of loose ends and that Johnny Depp really should retire that taciturn Gypsy shtick - for the first half of the film I thought he was mute - did anyone explain that he was no longer filming Chocolat or were these outtakes?.  Unfortunately, neither Johnny Depp nor Christina Ricci ignited sparks - they acted like a pair of misfits who try coupling because everyone else seems to be doing it.  Can a young woman so determined to get to America to find her father really go chasing Gypsies around the empty streets of Paris on a bicycle at night?  The supporting cast is excellent, Cate Blanchett as the cabaret dancer whose career moves involve finding wealthy men, and especially John Turturro as the egotistical Italian opera singer who is on all the time, even when it is for an audience of one.  I won't say that Christina Ricci was miscast, just that she and Johnny Depp could have been cut out of the film altogether and would not have been missed, because they had nothing to do except look at each other.  The script writers were certainly not being paid by the word in their case. I particularly enjoyed the glimpse of a few good long standing character actors, such as Miriam Karlin, but overall, the film had a feel of a miniseries on the Romance cable channel.  A British version of Ellis Island!

They are played against or triggered by a world plagued with war and upheaval the likes of which one hopes humanity will never see again. The Man Who Cried condenses in a handful of characters much of such 20th century misfortune. Ms. Potter takes the melancholy and haunting melody from Nadir's aria in Bizet's Pearl Fishers as a continuous motif.... even when disguised as something else (e.g. the Yiddish song in the Russian beginning)..... which inexorably weaves her sad tale of many woes .... as if the undulating accompaniment is recurring grief supporting the lyrical moments in our lives in the melody above. This is a most unusual film which leaves you with memory of your own feelings as you watched it ... more so than just the pegpoints of a narrative. Unfortunately, the last 10 minutes or so of the film are seriously flawed they seem contrived and almost precipitous. It's a pity, because it takes some of the lustre off.The movie is splendidly cast with top notch performances from everybody. I must single out Johnny Depp...... he projects great inner  strength through minimalist acting. In my opinion this man is one of the most underrated actors in film; I hope his body of work, ever more singular and distinguished,  will some day be fully and officially recognized.  Kate Blanchett is superb and her Russian accent, inflections and mannerisms, accentuate the bittersweet glamour of her part. She conveys a character of such complexity that leaves you wanting to know more. (It's wonderful to have a new great Kate to praise in films again). Tarkovsky stalwart Oleg Yankovsky (sp), Christina Ricci, John Turturro.... all are at their best.A film that will probably never have a mass audience but which we are glad it was made. It will stay with you if you have a certain sensitivity, doubly so if you appreciate the emotional richness resulting from the integration of a musical idea with a linear narrative to create a new, inseparable whole. I can see myself returning to this DVD.

Cate Blanchette as Lola turned in her typical great acting with a flawless Russian accent, but it was difficult to know where she fit into the larger plot at times.

Christina Ricci and Cate Blanchett are both stunningly beautiful and breathtakingly gifted. But if you check your IMDb stats, you'll notice that Cate Blanchett is more than ten years older than Christina, and a good six inches taller.What does this mean? Well, it means that when you see them together, Cate is obviously the one you'd pick as the big sister, the wise and protective mother figure. She towers over Christina like C3P0 standing next to R2D2. But in the story, Cate's character Lola is supposed to be a silly, empty-headed floozy while Christina's character Suzie is an intense, passionate, deeply determined young heroine. Neither actress is right in terms of age or appearance. Cate is too tall, too noble, too elegant and aristocratic a physical presence to be cast as a trashy, comically inept gold digger. And Christina Ricci is too tiny, too fresh-faced, and too physically undeveloped to be Cate's equal.At the same time, film maker Sally Potter seems absolutely indifferent to the realism of the story, and the storytelling problems of pace, suspense, tension and credibility. While little Suzie drifts dreamily into an almost mystical affair with a hunky Gypsy, (Johnny Depp) the needy and greedy Lola clumsily ropes in a rich but comically cruel and stupid opera star. (John Turturro, the only major character who's perfectly cast in type and ability.) Problem is, Suzie's dreamy affair doesn't really seem that heroic. She doesn't help her Gypsy friends escape the Nazis. She doesn't even help the nice Jewish lady who lives downstairs. All she does is moon around looking serious and dreamy. She hates the anti-Semitism of the cowardly opera singer, but she doesn't really do anything to counter it. She doesn't even warn Lola not to marry the guy, or tell her she could find lots of better men.The whole story would have worked much, much better if Cate Blanchett and Christina Ricci had been cast better according to size, age, looks and type. Cate should have been the rich, self-assured, and aristocratic wife of a Vichy French banker or politician. She hears Chrstina sing and is captivated by her waif-like looks and pure, child like voice. The two become friends, almost like sisters, but then Cate, who's good at heart but rather bored with her much older husband, starts up an affair with that stunning Gypsy lad. For her he's just a fun fling, but young Christina falls for him on a deeper level, wanting to help him save his people from the Nazis. When spoiled Cate finds out her little sister has stolen her man, she flies into a horrible jealous rage and tells the Nazis everything -- but at the last minute she comes to the rescue and dies nobly, allowing Christina and her Gypsy to escape to America on the last boat out of Marseilles.Now THAT'S a movie!

The acting, overall, is good and enjoyable. The story sucks. That does seem pretty harsh, but this film had true potential an aspiring opera singer travels to Paris and stays with a showgirl (who falls in love with an accomplished opera singer), and meets a gypsy whom she falls in love with. Instead it seems the writer tried to make something as dramatic as possible. Not only is she an aspiring singer, she's a Jew traveling to Paris in WWII from Russia after her father goes to America, and the opera singer who her roommate falls in love with is, very conveniently, a fascist. There are many more examples, which I won't say for spoiling reasons, but they're pretty easy to pick out. The writer just threw as much drama in as she could and came up with a wannabe-artful story that was as poorly directed as it was written.

I'm still wrapped in the atmosphere of it so I'll try to collect my thoughts.First of all it was a very interesting story.  True, not especially original or unique.  But considering the backdrop of Russia, war, WWII, Paris, Germans and general fleeing there are only so many ways to tell those stories.  But what the story is really about is the people in it.To be a little more specific, Sally Potter (writer/director) started telling it right away, and from that moment it had my attention until the credits rolled up.Some movies hold my attention and pull me into their world because they are so real.  Some do the same thing because they create a feeling or truth that resonates with the same feeling or truth in me.  That is what this movie did.  Right away I could see that it was not even trying to tell the story of these events in a factual, journalistic way.  Rather, it was trying to create the image of the story in my heart, so I could always touch it and hear it.Its strange, in a way, because I could point to some flaws both in the movie itself, as well as some acting or directing,  but it doesn't matter because that isn't where the magic of this movie is.  That magic is in the whole gestalt of the movie, acting, music, and story, all working together to create a Jungian world of symbols as well as heart-felt emotions.There isn't much more I could say without giving away plot or needlessly going into details.  So I'll just leave you with what I've said so far.If you appreciated Orlando (another Sally Potter movie) for some of the reasons I mentioned above  then give The Man Who Cried a try.  It also has a beautiful and haunting soundtrack, much of it played by the Kronos Quartet.Finally John Turturro and Johnny Dep are plenty of reason to at least make it worth the price of a rental.Esteban "},{"Title":"Uninteresting, bordering on BORING in spite of top-notch cast!","Date":"13 November 2002","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Music, Romance","Review":"  This film is curiously uninteresting and the top-notch cast put totally to waste.

Christina Ricci never seems fully convincing and Johnny Depp, sadly, was under used. He is the gypsy she falls for and their love story was so unbelievable. They had zero chemistry to start with, and they barely uttered two words to each other and suddenly she was prepared to throw her life away for him? But it was stylishly directed and the music was beautiful and powerful, but you get the feeling it could have been so much more and more fleshed out. It was about the characters yet you didn't care for them nor do you really feel like you know them. Especially Christina's character, who is the driving force of the movie. You didn't care whether she found her father or not, or whether she even got out of Paris alive.I can't really recommend it.

The milieu is that of the Paris Opera, (she's in the chorus), and the plot is hardly conventional, (it's practically non-existent). Both she and her romantic interest, Johnny Depp, cast yet again as a monosyllabic gypsy, are negligible but the film has a couple of genuine stars in Cate Blanchett as a Russian femme fatale and John Turturro, miming to his heart's content as an Italian opera singer. Blanchett, in particular, seems to be having a right old time though you wonder just how seriously she was taking things.It's consistently attractive to look at and Potter makes good use of the widescreen.

It begins in the 1920s, with a poor family of Jews in Russia. The father sings opera and religious songs, his small daughter and he are very close. He decides to go to America to earn money but leaves his family behind. As the Naxi occupation becomes more threatening, the remaining family are required to move. The young girl, about 5, separated from her brothers and ends up in a very foreign place. The movie is really her story, as she grows up and is educated in England, but as a young adult refuses to believe that she will never see her father again.SPOILERS. Christina Ricci is good in the lead role as Suzie, the name given to her as she came off the boat in England. Raised in a foster home, she all but forgot her Russian background, and could only speak English. She ended up in Paris, working as a singer and showgirl, getting in with the more seasoned Lola (Cate Blanchett), a showgirl who would do about anything to get a wealthy man to support her. Lola was going to help Suzie get to America.Another main character is Dante Dominio (John Turturro), an opera singer who is very difficult, and who takes in Lola. Also vindictive, near the end he exposes Suzie as a Jew, as the Nazis are taking control of Paris, and she is forced to flee.Johnny Depp plays Cesar, a member of a band of gypsies in Paris. He befriends Suzie, they begin a torrid love affair, but in the end she has to leave him and take a boat to America.When Suzie finally gets to New York and looks up the Jewish community, it isn't easy finding her father. With a picture she carried since he left home years earlier, some remembered him, recalling that he had changed his name and headed to Hollywood to make his fortune, thinking all his original family members had died.

I love movies and I like a lot of movies that people don't like (exmy family didn't really like Edward Scissorhands, I loved it, I thought that Burton is a genius) but this is one of my least favorite movies besides Win a Date with Tad Hamilton and Once Upon a time in Mexico. There was no plot, and you had to read about 3/4 of the movie. I am a huge fan of Johnny Depp's i've seen about 11 of his movies, but his character was terrible. I mean he only had about 2 lines and one of them was in a different language. But don't get me wrong, he said those 2 lines well. And why did they have to blow up Cate Blanchett? I thought she was great in LOTR but this movie made her seem evil! At the end of the movie I said That was it? I thought they would have had more like, father gets out of hospital, they live happily ever after. And did they really need that much time for a flash back? But the weirdest part of the movie was the very beginning where they showed Christina Ricci floating in the ocean. I mean WHAT IS WITH THAT! Over all, I give this movie .5 out of 1,000,000.

Granted, I think that that might only be because I'm a hopeless sap-addict with a love of Johnny Depp.  I would not be surprised if Johnny Depp looks back on this movie and cringes, but then he doesn't strike me as someone who regrets past career mistakes.This is definitely not Oscar material.  The story is too complex, too image friendly, too convoluted to appeal to most audiences.  It's told in vignettes, almost, with few connecting points between the various scenes apart from the over-all story.  Understanding the point of the story is like wading through thick mud; it's abstruse and murky.But there are a few high points as well.  The imagery is beautiful, and one is truly touched by the Depp/Ricci dynamic.  Or at least I was.  As an Official Johnny Depp fan I love Sleepy Hollow, but I did have trouble overcoming how wooden the Depp/Ricci relationship was.  It's not nearly as wooden this time, as if they are both much more comfortable working with each other this time around.  Not only that, but the Sleepy Hollow script did not require them to display real affection and in this one they have to.  My big complaint about this area of the film, is that there wasn't all that much development of this story.  As a person with an over-large imagination, I filled in some of the blank spots edited out by the writers, and thus cried my eyes out along with Depp at the end of the film.  But I can see where a lot of people would not be impressed with this.Cate Blanchett wasn't bad, but I really dislike the fluttery attitude that her character affects throughout the film.  It's irritating and rather comical.But, I liked the movie.  I've watched it once and I know that I'll watch it again.  Why not?

Absolutely hated it. By the end, I wanted to gouge my eyes out with gummi bears. And I don't say that very often.Usually not judgmental about films, I had to give it a chance to work itself out in the end, but WHAT A JOKE. This has some of the poorest editing and plot configuration I have ever seen. And I hate knocking the director, but she was very forgettable. I wonder if Christina Ricci even read the script for this movie before she signed on. One good thing I do have to say about The Man Who Cried -- gorgeous music. Very pretty, very sad Italian opera and gypsy melodies. The soundtrack would probably be better worth your time than the film.In short... by the end, you just have a headache, and are befuddled at how even Johnny Depp's hotness couldn't save this movie.

I figured it would be a typical weepy....nice Jews, bad nazis, concentration camps.... seen it all before.Well, I thought, Christina Ricci is always nice to watch.Surprisingly, this movie is a small well crafted gem. The script is full of subtleties, and there are well done performances, no ham allowed ( sorry, bad ethnic pun).In fact, Cate Blanchett in the second female role is the only clinker, more due to miscasting than ability. The strength of Christina's character was worth the few melodramatic twists.

After a ridiculous (and I'll bet expensive) mini Titanic segment with the beleaguered Susie floundering around in a golden ocean, she finally makes her way to a goal which I had not realized was the meaning and direction of the plot. And it ends (unexpectedly but blissfully). I must say, however that the cast was very well coached and performed a variety of accents very convincingly....Cate Blanchett (Russian), John Turturro (Italian), Christina Ricci (English) and Johnny Depp (silent),    "},{"Title":"A real stinker!","Date":"12 January 2002","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Music, Romance","Review":"  This has to be one of the groaningly dumb movies I've seen in ages. Picked up the thing because of the names in the cast - Turturro, Depp, Blanchett. But I should have thought twice about the director - Potter!  It's her fault, no doubt at all. The story is ridiculous.  Little Susie/Fegele is finally going to America to find her Daddy (within a day, apparently) but her ship (What's it? The Lusitania?) is blown up crossing the Atlantic by what sounds like a Jap kamekaze, and within minutes she is fished out of the burning wreckage, and proceeds on her chronically depressed way. Turturro is assigned the feckless role of closet-fascist Italian opera noodnik and injects the only genuinely comic touch in the film by doing his opera arias with deliberate John Turturro facial grimaces, simultaneously acting a jerk and thumbing his nose at Potter. Blanchett either on her own poor judgment or due to Potter's megalomania, attempts to do a Meryl Streep get-a-load-of-THIS-accent performance, but succeeds only in escalating the amount of 40s glamour-siren lipstick she can wear and still talk. Depp seems to be biting his tongue as he's forced to freeze a somber romantic-gypsy-stud expression on his face and engage Ricci in moronic dialogue about how she ought to go on fighting (not that she's been doing any in particular).  Holding her in bed, he cries.  Guess he's the man who, or is it her Daddy in the final scene who's finally reunited with his little Fegele after becoming fatally depressed by how many Hollywood musicals he's produced. Sally Potter will eventually get there if she goes on in this vein.

It is hard to take the threatening WW2 backdrop seriously when the one-liners sound like B-movie made-for-TV clichés. Ricci did not carry the lead role competently. She lacks the gravitas necessary to convincingly convey the antisemitism and pariah status that the Fegele/Susan character was aiming for. Too bad since the moving music deserves a profound lead actor. Unfortunately, the superb soundtrack seemed to set in stark relief the inadequacy of the dialogue. I gave it a 6 by reminding myself that the 1-10 ranking system needs to stoop low enough to include really awful movies and this movie was certainly not awful. But certainly not great either.

Is there anything so wrong with that? And anyway, maybe there's something I'm missing. Christina Ricci is marvellous. You'd swear she was the most gorgeous woman alive - at least, that's what I was tempted to think, while she was directly before my eyes. She may well have the most luminously lovely screen presence since ... I don't know, since Marilyn Monroe, although her persona is of course completely different.

Soon after she finds herself a refugee headed for England without any of her family with her. Renamed Suzie and placed with an English family, she grows up a beautiful woman with a good singing voice but still longs to follow her father to America. Getting a job as a dancer in Paris, she starts to save her money to ultimately make the trip &#150; even if her gold-digger friend Lola advises her to hook a rich man to take her. This seems unlikely though, as Suzie actually falls the dark-eyed mystery of gypsy Cesar.It was the cast that attracted me to this film which normally is all well and good but this hook alone cannot hold me to a film if nothing else comes along. With this film so much of it scream out of professionalism but the narrative and the characters never seemed to step up the plate and show the film the way forward. The focal point of Suzie is supposed to carry the film with her feelings and her experiences but this is sadly the weakest part of the film. With long periods of no dialogue, the cast seem to find it difficult to know what to bring out of the story and the script isn't good enough to develop the characters enough for me to really care about them. It is still interesting enough for those with patience to stick with it but I did wonder if Potter felt that the best way to achieve a sort of aching poignancy in her film was just to have it move incredibly slowly.It is a shame because otherwise she has made it look pretty good. OK, some of her shots are rather contrived and her desire to find beautiful locations at times takes away from the realism, but generally it is an attractive film to look at. The locations and sets look equally as good and generally the film's use of music is quite haunting. Sadly the script isn't there to be supported by all this. Other reviewers have called it sensually driven as opposed to events driven and other similar claims but to me this is a pretty poor excuse for a story that is lacking and badly structured. The cast are a bit unsure of themselves as a result and few can manage to do much with their characters. Ricci is a bit stiff and unconvincing, seemingly unable to understand who she is playing and what she should be feeling. Turturro is mis-cast and although he tries hard he doesn't fit his character or his dubbed singing voice. Without much to work with, Depp decides just to trade on his moody looks and almost gets away with it. Blanchett is pretty good and gives a good performance with a simple character. Stanton gets a job but doesn't have much to do.Overall then, a pretty dull film that looks good but otherwise has little going for it. The narrative is dawdling at best and the script has forgotten to develop its characters, leaving the cast with an uphill struggle to even deliver a story, far less characters.

The music was outstanding, particularly the gypsy singing/dancing and music scenes. The funeral scene was touching and sad. Costuming was well done, and set design for the gypsy encampment was great. Loved the traditional gypsy relationship with horses; amazing scene riding horses at night with the Eiffel tower in the background. I will definitely watch other Sally Potter films; I found it erotic, a visual feast and delightful to watch. I loved that things in general were understated, not shoved in the viewer's face. A beautiful, artistic film. "}]
