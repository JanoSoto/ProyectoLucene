[{"Title":"Stupid plot, rubbish effects and almost no tension to speak of","Date":"19 July 2004","Score":"48 out of 73 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":"  Mike Brody appears to be totally over the events that struck his family in his youth and now works in Florida's newest underwater attraction &#150; Seaworld. His brother, Sean is less sure and never goes in the water &#150; although a visit to see Mike and a new girlfriend help him confront his fear if not get over it. Meanwhile, something is picking off staff and swimmers getting Mike and the staff out on a shark hunt. They capture a small great white and take it into captivity, only for it to die when it is put in too small a tank. They think their problems are over until an examination of the bite marks on some bodies and they realize that the shark that did the killing is much, much bigger than the one they caught.I saw this film as a child but couldn't remember if it was any good or not &#150; my childish fears may have made it scary even if the film was poor, so I decided to give it a go again recently. The first thing that struck me was the sheer rubbishness of the effects. In the original Jaws, Spielberg had hidden the shark as much as he could because the effects didn't work (and also therefore upping the tension); however here the makers just decide to show anything &#150; a poorly superimposed image, a rubber shark, fake severed arms and so on &#150; none of them are concealed, they are all shown up in all their rubbish glory. I could forgive it this due to its age but two other films had already managed to handle this issue before this film so I don't see why they went this route when it so clearly didn't work. Some shots are so bad that they could have been mistaken for being a spoof (witness the shark swimming towards the control room).Of course, after the poor effects the second thing that hits you is the laughable plot. True it is not as bad as part 4 in terms of plausibility but it is still pretty thin. No attempt is made to really give the characters any sort of, well, character and the very basic sea world plot just about manages to give the shark enough high profile feeding scenes to keep the film moving &#150; just don't hold your breath for any logic or sense. In fact, the opposite is true and this film does deliver some moments that make you wonder what the writers were thinking when they conceived some of this stuff! The manner of Jaws' death here would be hilarious if it wasn't so darn pathetic. Even with the plot being poor the film should still have had at least a few moment of fear and tension &#150; many of us fear being eaten alive so it isn't hard to draw on that, but this fails to have any tension or excitement to speak of. The effects suck a lot of this out &#150; but a director who's name is listed in the dictionary alongside the work 'workmanlike' didn't do anything to stop the rot either.Without characters the cast are set adrift with nothing to do &#150; how Quaid must have envied Roy Schnieder in the first films, at least he was a good character. Quaid runs around the place, Armstrong screams, Putch broods, Thompson screams and Gossett tries to act tough in the middle of a script that gives him nothing to do. I don't blame the cast but I am disappointed that nobody mention how very bad taste it was to make a happy ending out of the dolphins surviving while so many other people had not!Overall this is just a bad film. I'm not a big one for lists so I'll not play that game here but it is pretty much without any value at all. The plot is poor, the effects are rubbish, the direction is weak, the script just a load of nonsense and there is a total lack of tension, thrills or excitement. The original is a classic and this film is further proof that sometimes classics should be just left alone.

I don't think it is a masterpiece or anything, but it is good if not taken to seriously.  This one focuses on the Brodie boys who really went through a growth spurt.  One (Dennis Quaid) works at a sea amusement park and this is where the shark attacks take place (this should alone tell you not to take the film to seriously).  I actually saw this one at the theater too, so that helps to enjoy the film more as it was rather cool in 3-D and it is the only 3-D movie I have ever seen at the theater so maybe that is why I will always somewhat enjoy it.  The plot is at a sea park like I said and first the team goes after this one shark that was rather puny, then you find out there is a bigger one out there.  There are a couple of pretty good shark attack scenes and I loved the subplot of the people stuck in that pod underwater.  This film isn't for everyone though seeing as how it is ranked as one of the worst so read other people's reviews before deciding to see it.

'cause they wanna be more than they're. Sometimes, they look laughable, but the physical effects are awesome (the great great white). I appreciate this movie 'cause this is a movie of my childhood. I saw and recorded it on TV, and I grew with Mike and Kathryn, my right heroes!!!.Now, I'm conscious about the film's mistakes, but, for a third installment, the result ins't so bad. The plot couldn't innovate the genre, but the idea of a baby shark and his angry mother is... so childish and imaginative. Otherwise the idea of a shark attack in a aquatic park is fabulous. I think that if they made this movie without the 3D effect it looked better. Sometimes, the scales don't agree, and the lake looks deeper than it is, for example. The ending, with the mother breaking the control room's glass is... funny (and ridiculous) ...The characters are well performed, but I saw this film on the Spanish version, so the dubbing actors could act better than the original actors. Because of that, I don't understand why Louis Gosset Jr. was nominated for a Razzie award Â¿?. The relationship of Mike-Kathryn and Sean-Kelly are convincing.This movie is far for being the worst of the series. it's clearly weaker than the first ones, but...worthy and entertaining. If the effects weren't 3D, the movie was totally fabulous. But, furthermore there was the 80s. It doesn't look so bad for being 80s. Isn't it?

(I was ten) This film furthers the saga of the Brody family as sons Sean and Mike are now fully grown and moved away from Amity Island. Sean does something in Colorado if I recall, and Mike is (heh, heh, heh,) an underwater welder who just finished construction of an undersea kingdom at Sea World in Florida. Just when the park is about to have a grand opening, some uninvited guests show up. They being a 35-foot great white shark and her offspring. Needless to say, some people get eaten.This film was originally going to be made as spoof of the previous two films. I'm not sure if any type of a finished script to that effect exists, but it would be worth a look. Jaws 3D ends up being another serious monster movie with a disaster movie subplot. Not only does the shark eat a bunch of people, it also traps several others in the underwater part of the park. The race is on to save the people and kill the mother shark. Her baby dies midway through after it is captured and hastily put on display in the park. The conclusion is fairly exciting, and full of bloody carnage.The cast is one of the stronger points of the film. Dennis Quaid is the fearless Mike Brody. Bess Armstrong plays the park's head biologist and Quaid's love interest. (The real sparks were apparently flying between Quaid and Lea Thompson off camera, though!) Thompson plays a water skier at the park, and John Putch plays Sean Brody who falls for her. Simon MacCorkindale and P.H. Moriarity play a couple of Aussies who show up and help battle the sharks. By far the best performance is turned in by Louis Gossett Jr., fresh off his Oscar for An Officer and a Gentleman. He plays the owner/manager/president (I'm really not sure which) of the park. He has a terrific moment as he addresses the park guests in the underwater tunnels over the p.a. system. He turns on the fake executive public relations charm and asks them all to calmly exit the park just as the giant shark is bearing down on them.The individuals who play Dan and Liz left a lot to be desired. Since no other film credits are listed for them, one would have to conclude that they actually worked at Sea World and were given these roles since this is what they do on a daily basis. Maybe they still work there. Anyone know? The sharks look pretty good in most of the scenes. Except at the very end when the shark is lodged into the control room and its tail is sticking out. That looked incredibly fake. In addition, sharks must always stay moving in the water or they'll die. They can't just lay low in huge underwater structures waiting to pounce on their victims. They usually strike from directly underneath their victims in most attack scenarios. The big shark in this film also has the ability to growl and roar, but not as loudly as the one in part IV! The 3D effect looked very good in the theater, but films like this lose quite a bit of their luster on the TV screen. You're only left with a bunch of gag shots that were supposed to scare viewers in the theater, but now look ludicrous and forced.This film made some pretty decent $ in its theatrical run, and is still shown regularly on television. If nothing else is on, and you find yourself in front of a TV for an extended period, give this film a try. But be forewarned Part IV is perhaps the worst film ever made. Don't waste your time on that one! 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.

Having survived the horror of Jaws The Revenge once, I decided to see if I could brave this one, though.About the only thing that surprised me was that the premise wasn't quite as dumb as Jaws The Revenge is.  And while there is a reference to the events of Jaws 2 at least they don't insult our intelligence with a shark pursuing one family etc. of any Brody curse. What sinks this film though is that it's dull in every sense.  The FX are cheap and terrible and too often it's hard to figure out what's going on here.  Scenes that could have been suspenseful with a competent director just plod along in a muddled fashion.  In the end, Jaws 3 comes off more as a glorified made for TV type disaster movie with none of the high quality that elevates the original Jaws above such fare.

Set some fourteen years after the events of JAWS 2, Mike Brody now works as a marine biologist at Sea World, where a baby great white shark has managed to find it's way into the park through an open gate, where it subsequently dies. However as it turns out, this baby shark is not alone, as it's 35 foot mother has also entered through the gate & begins wrecking havoc on the guests attending the park.JAWS 3-D was the third instalment in the popular moneymaking JAWS series. Throughout the years JAWS 3-D has been given mostly a bad rap by fans, but in my opinion it's nowhere near as bad as many are saying. While far from a perfect film, JAWS 3-D does manage to be a fairly watchable & enjoyable time passer if you are in the right frame of mind. It's not the original, nor does it try to be & I think that is why I tend to see more in this sequel than most fans in the series do. It's a fun little movie, nothing more, nothing less. The plot for the most part is pretty fun & is the only sequel in the series that attempts to do something new with the plot rather than just have another shark on the shores of Amity Long Island run amok & it's also the only movie in the franchise where virtually none of the cast members of the first two return. The direction by JOE ALVES was pretty good, as he manages to capture the action at all the right angles & delivers several cool shots, in fact this would remain his only film, afterwards he went directly back into production designing, which is odd, since he was seemingly obsessed with having a directing career back in the late seventies/early eighties & when the baby sharks mother gets into the park & wrecks havoc, it's well worth the wait.On the downside however I will admit the film does have a few problems. While I did enjoy the direction by first & only time helmer JOE ALVES, he clearly isn't to polished when it comes to building up much tension or suspense in the film, in fact the film is severely lacking in the suspense & tension department & things aren't helped to much by the films 3D effects that are utterly lame, in fact even some of the corniest of 3D movies released during the 3D Birthquake that briefly re-visited screens back in the early 80's, at least took the time to create some interesting 3D images, even if they weren't very original. JAWS 3-D's effects are very poorly done, surprisingly so, considering the fact it was a big budget movie, released by a major studio. In fact the 3-D effects look utterly fake & are not very well done at all. Other 3D movies released during the era, at least took careful steps to separate the actors or objects from the backgrounds, because otherwise there is no real 3D, everything would just look like a cardboard cut out & that's precisely what's wrong with the effects work here! the objects being floated in front of the screen look like pieces of cardboard floating pass the screen or towards the audience (not much fun there) the films interesting plot about a shark getting past the gate & into Sea World is ripe with possibilities for endless shark carnage, but due to the films PG rating, the film never really does anything with it's interesting premise & the threat is never felt even, especially when things are supposed to pick up. Even the lower budgeted JAWS knock-off PIRANHA (1978) did far better things with the intended carnage on the innocent, by schools of deadly fish, both at a summer camp & at the grand opening of a new resort, where dozens of unaware visitors fell prey to deadly fish & the hero's of the story attempting to stop them. No terror ever really breaks loose resulting in an utter waste of something that would have really enlivened the film. Most of the characterization isn't fully fleshed out & the film wastes to much time on Sean Brody & a potential love interest in Lea Thompson, that does nothing for the story & goes absolutely nowhere, in fact I could have done without Mike's younger brother & Thompson's character, take them both out & you would still have a movie! & the film is practically over by the time the baby sharks mother breaks loose & wrecks havoc on the parks participants. A lot the the optical shots look silly & many of the 3D gags just don't work.All in all, I will admit that while JAWS 3-D may not be in & of itself a great movie, or even a good one, I don't hate it, at least not compared to some other reviewers who have heaped an unending amount of venom on the film. In fact it's actually my favourite sequel after the original (Yes I admit I'm probably one of five people walking this earth who thinks so & one of ten who actually enjoys this movie as a whole) maybe it's nostalgia talking here, since it was actually the very first JAWS movie I ever saw when I was really young & still remember the night my family rented it on VHS back in the mid 80's, I was terrified & it still holds a special place in my heart & instantly takes me back to that special night, making this film in an odd ball sort of way, like a time capsule every time I pop it in to watch it.

There's nothing fundamentally wrong with the idea, it at least adds many new elements to the Jaws formula. Where it all goes wrong is in the execution. The acting, direction, and production values are way, way below what they should have been. The 3-D effects are ridiculous. They bring to mind a SCTV parody of 3-D films, with exaggerated tricks that add nothing to someone watching this in regular format. Compare this to something like The Creature From The Black Lagoon, or It Came From Outer Space- those films were 3-D but play perfectly well as flat films. But those were made by people with talent, this film is not.There's also the weird idea of using the Sea World park, but making it a fictitious one located near the ocean with completely different attractions- it's a strange bit of promotional advertising. The real Sea World is quite different, and yet it's shown with all these fantastic elements that are pure fantasy. A better idea would have been to name the marine attraction something original. The scenes somehow come off way more corny and trite than the actual theme park was at the time. The use of the dolphins is a great idea that is staged horribly. The old Flipper show had better shark vs. dolphin scenes.The effects are wretched. In fact, had they worked it would have helped save the whole film from being a waste, but they are totally amateurish, below that of a Roger Corman exploitation film from the 50s or 60s. One expects more from a major studio mounting a sequel to a mega-hit.The actors offer nothing here. Dennis Quaid and Louis Gosset have shown remarkable talent, but none of it is on display here. Bess Armstrong and Lea Thompson are both very attractive, but again they don't really add anything, and Thompson seems especially vapid here. Luckily all these actors are in a film so filled with incompetence that the music, effects, editing and overall storytelling distract from their work.

When the film hit the video shelves, they scrapped the whole thing. Why make a 3-D movie in the first place if you're not going to take advantage of it when it's available for the home video market? The video looked bad when it was released as a rental. Many of the scenes that were shot didn't make any sense or were badly projected. The movie did poorly at the box office and after a couple of years, no more mainstream films were presented in 3-D. The movie itself is pretty bad. Only for die hard fans of the JAWS series.Not recommended, unless they re-release it in 3-D. other than that it's pretty much worthless.

With strange accidents in the park becoming a routine occurrence, they dive into a lagoon on the grounds and find a shark in it. After capturing the shark and putting it on display, it dies in it's first show. Unsure of how to carry on, they find the shark's mother still living inside the park and attacking the facilities. Working against the possible disasters, they race to stop the fix the attractions and shark before it destroys the park.The Good News This one wasn't that bad and was actually pretty decent. The film's greatest factor is that the characterization scenes aren't all that aggravating to sit through. The bar scenes and the few shown with the couples on the job are decently done, giving off a nice sense that a normal couple could be involved in these types of affairs without being forced into them. This sticks out mostly from the uncharacteristic nature of them, and are handled quite nicely, and while they do go on a little bit long for some, they're not a complete time-waster and that's a nice thing to know. The action does come along at the end in all the right installments, featuring a lot of big action set-pieces that come off really well. The discovery of the mother promotes all this, and the film starts in earnest at the time when it crashes into the complex and floods it. The sight of the shark appearing out of nowhere in front of a panicked crowd of tourists and crashes into their structure has delightful possibilities, and they are somewhat played nicely here. It also has a neat shock, as the disembodied head of a victim floats on-screen in front of an unsuspecting child. It's a classic shock that never fails. The race to fix the problem of the stranded visitors is a nice suspense-builder, coming off in a very elegant manner and allowing for some really nail-biting scenes. The chase through the underwater ship is pretty nicely done, and comes off with a great air of urgency about it. The shark in here also looks the closest to a real shark, giving off a realistic shape that is really close to a great white rather than a demonic face with a shark's body. It also displays a realistic touch by moving it's upper lip to attack, something that none of the other sharks did. This wasn't all that terrible.The Bad News There actually isn't that much to really dislike in this one. Most of what's wrong with the film is that the effects are pretty abysmal. The 3-D effect isn't employed beyond poking objects into the camera for no reason, stopping the film cold to show those effects. Needless scenes, as having a needle make sure it'll eject properly or having a dolphin emerge out of the water in our faces being prime examples. The green-screen photography present also doesn't help matters, often times making them look worse. The miniature tub is the greatest example, although the young, lifeless shark comes really close. There's no believability at all in hardly anything in the film, and this really hurts the film. It's nearly impossible to have any fear or tension in a film where the main threat isn't imposing, and it's on display nearly every time there's a shark on-screen here. The stupidity inherent in so many situations is a major crime, especially in the first shark's capture and display to the public being quite obvious. The reasons why won't be revealed, but upon thinking of the circumstances surrounding it are mind-numbing and wouldn't play out in real life. The measure of taking out the creature also applies, as it really defies logic that it would be so, and in a scene full of nonsensical things, it's hard to pick one thing about the ending that really works. Just about everything, from the really bad 3-D effects to the shark effects and the eventual outcome all having some manner of involvement together really make it underwhelming. The shark itself deserves mention, as the body count in here is really unacceptable. For a giant shark to cause as much damage and mischief as it does, to be around as many thrashing bodies in the water as it always manages to be around, and the fact that it sneaks up on the victims isn't going to be left out. There should've been more kills in here, and with so many missed opportunities, it's a real shame. The number of times it manages to sneak up on the water-skies without managing so much as to nick them on the leg is a major misgiving, and it really does nothing to help inspire fear in the shark, and with it's appearance and failure to get at so many of it's potential victims, this really fails as a compelling killer shark. These are the main things involved with this that really bring it down.The Final Verdict While it's not a complete, utter and total catastrophe like others in the series, there is some fun in this being a total camp-fest. It's a fun, cheesy affair that doesn't really do anything other than be great at that, and that's not that bad for a film to be. If this appeals to you, take a shot, if not, stick to the first two of the sequels.Rated PG Graphic Violence and some mild Language "},{"Title":"Terrible special effects but I liked it anyway","Date":"15 January 2003","Score":"9 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":"  *SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*Jaws invades an underwater park.

In the case of this film it worked and it is liked by many fans. Not that the film is a contender for winning an Oscar, but it's very good for what it is. However in some cases it turned out that the 3-D thing was used to fill up the seats and bring in the bucks. Such is the case with the third 'Jaws' movie, which was preceded by a classic film and an above average first sequel. By this point it seemed that Universal and the makers of the film didn't care about quality because even on it's own 'Jaws 3' is a loser. It's a case of a decent concept poorly executed and the result is a film best forgotten.Pros A great new setting. Nice underwater photography. Cast does a decent job. Moves at an OK pace. The film finally comes to life in the last third with some action packed moments.Cons Poor screenplay. Lousy special effects. Mediocre score except for the use of John Williams' theme. Apart from one scene in the first half, the rest of the film lacks the tension of it's predecessors. Looks like a made for TV movie thanks to Joe Alves bland direction. The first two films have human drama too, but here it's poorly written and directed and just bogs the film down.Final thoughts Let's face it, we didn't need even one sequel to the first film, let alone more. The first film stands on it's own and is truly the best of the killer shark films. 'Jaws 2' is an unnecessary sequel, but the talent involved make it worth a look. This installment isn't even a guilty pleasure, it's just a waste of time. A shame because the water park setting had potential and in the right hands this could have been a treat.

However, anyone with an open mind and a love for man vs nature will see this film as an exciting adventure. I urge everyone to give this film a second chance...it deserves it.

I love hokey, cheesy movies. And horror/thrillers never fail to turn out as such in basket loads. The Original Jaws is a classic in every sense of the word, a genuine edge of your seat thriller, that despite my having seen it 413 times never ceases to make me jump at just the right moments. The first sequel Jaws 2, was just your average, late-1970's rehash, Chief Brody is scared of Sharks, we get it, but not bad either, it had going for it a reasonable number of the original cast and enough of the shark to keep even the most slacked of jaws happy. Jaws The Revenge (the fourth one) is just trash, stupid and without redeeming value (except Michael Caine, but that is another review). But this little, almost lost gem, is just so great it blinds me as a shining example of how to make a great second sequel without any of the original cast, and being a sequel in name only, Halloween wishes it could the Jaws series, and Highlander, I laugh at you (and not in a good way). A quick rundown of the plot finds MIKE BRODY (son of Roy Scheider, is afflicted with the most interesting aging disease ever, as first he ages too fast, then starts to go backwards), played by Dennis Quaid, who was at the time, near the peak of his cocaine habit. Although to be fair, he keeps it hidden MOST of the time. He was something of a heart-throb in the 80's, and the years since have been kind to him, as he still turns out pretty decent fair and hasn't gotten too ugly with age. He, John Schneider, and Sean Connery should all do a film that compliments their superior genetics. Oh sorry...got off topic for a second. Brody is an UNDERWATER ENGINEER (real likely field of work, given his history, anybody with anything remotely approaching logical reasoning abilities would go and be a farmer in Kansas) who is the leading member of the construction crew finishing up a new addition to Sea World. Lou Gossett Jr. is Calvin Bouchard, an interesting millionaire who owns Sea World and is implied to have dragged himself up by his bootstraps, thus explaining his thick quasi-Cajun accent, and lack of refinement. A lot was made of his being in the film just after his win of a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for An Officer and a Gentleman, but he probably had most of this flick in the can before the awards ceremony (Shark Chow). Bess Armstrong is Brody's girlfriend (fiance) who is also a marine biologist, fortunately for both her and Brody, she has a strange power over dolphins, and that saves them. Simon (Manimal) MacCorkindale makes an appearance as the only person I have ever actually wanted to be eaten by a shark in a movie (and real life too), fortunately the movie doesn't disappoint. We get to see the most annoying member of the Brody men, Mike's brother Sean, who despite having a stated fear of water, spends quite a bit of the film in the water. Keep an eye open for a young Lea Thompson, she dated Quaid for a while after they met making this movie. Needless to say, a shark makes its way into the park, eats a few people (for the relatively few of us who have actually seen the movie in 3-D, it is a pretty neat special effect) and then has to be taken out by Brody. He uses a grenade, borrowed from MacCorkindale's corpse, as it has been decided that the only way for the shark's to go is to be blown to smithereens. Don't worry the dolphins rush Quaid and Armstrong to the surface after the coolest 3-d explosion ever, without worry or mention of the Bends. There is a very special place in my heart for this movie. For some reason I must be the only one, as the next film, just pretends this never happened. Which is sad because this one actually made money at the theaters, and has characters that are relatively easy to care about. Watch Jaws the Revenge, and you are hoping the entire Brody clan is taken out, not quite the heroes we were hoping for. But this little film is a great time waster. If you don't have a date for Friday night, or if like I once did, you do and she just wants to spend the night with the TV, some popcorn, the couch, a blanket, and you. You really can't go too wrong with this one. It's also a great flick to show the kiddies (I told you I am sick), I showed it to my then 5 year old nephew just before a trip to the beach, and a good time was had by all (although therapy bills are expensive). Get a copy, it's out on DVD (though not in 3-d), make a batch of popcorn, and enjoy your lovely Friday night.

I do not care what any one says, this film is a true piece of work. With the same type of opening, of a P.O.V. shot in the deep blue ocean, which was missed in Jaws 2, this one has a creepy feeling from the beginning. Admittingly, the first two films preceeding this have it beat in many areas, but not all! The very idea of not one, but TWO sharks in Sea World as its grand opening takes place...is just freaky! Special effects will suffer when viewed with out 3-D glasses, however, the film is still enjoyable to watch. Alan Parker povides the film with a new kind of shrieking score that makes the feel a little eerie as the original shark theme is put to the test, and brought to a new level of scary. What most call boring, is the intellectual discussions that the main characters speak of as they, being adults, must deal with the water crises in the most mature way they can. Different ideas of murder, explosions, and captivity are all the order of the evening as the exposition is revealed. Later, the film takes a plunge when hungry mamma is let out, and all hell breaks loose, literally. Not so much the scares, as the shocks, are what draws me to this film, and every minute is worth while. Never trust the ocean, it is always full of suprises, and in all the wrong ways.

The Production design specifically was entertaining. It helped that they showed a model of the undersea kingdom in the beginning to fill the gaps left by the crumbing special effects. But since almost the entire movie takes place inside the park, the filmmakers do a good job of making you feel like you are at an actual Sea World. Dennis Quaid demonstrates (for however brief) that he can fill a man of action role well. Bess Armstrong is hopelessly sincere even while spouting out ridiculous lines. Also the underwater photography is clearer and more fleshed out than is the norm.So if you are looking for a coherent, entertaining film - search elsewhere.

This time around it takes place at Sea World, and the main characters are the sons of the previous film's hero, Martin Brody. After several people are killed by a shark, the baby is accidentally captured, being mistaken for the culprit. Things take an exciting turn, when the culprit shark arrives to find it's baby and have a bite to eat. It's actually amazing that anybody in their right mind would be willing to take a risk making another Jaws movie, but I'm sure the 3-D effects helped it out a little. I'll admit that the cinematography was pretty nice in some spots, and the music could be pretty exciting, but it isn't as scary or as suspenseful as the incredible previous films. The acting in this movie is abysmal with a few exceptions, Dennis Quaid was okay as the hero, Louis Gossett Jr. helped to keep the movie afloat, no pun intended. And Lea Thompson wasn't all that bad either, she's mostly there for eye candy but whatever. The other actors were pretty lame, including the pompous Australian character who becomes dinner for the shark. The special effects can't even save the movie though, they are seriously some of the worst I have ever seen. There are several cheesy shots that were obviously for the three dimensional magic that simply doesn't exist without the glasses and the various super imposed images are extremely laughable, at one point you can actually see part of the little submarine get eaten up by the blue screen. The most gruesome scene in the movie is when despite his dull death scene, the shark's first victim's corpse floats in front of a glass tunnel and scaring everyone to death. It was funny when the corpse is right against the glass wall, right in front of a teenage girl, who is not only screaming in utter terror, but is pressed against the glass. I laughed so hard during this insanely goofy scene. On the other hand, it was gross seeing the corpse laid out on a table completely skinless from the neck down, and crabs crawling out of his mouth, pretty cool. I'm sure it must have been somewhat entertaining to see this movie in it's original cheesy 3-D glory, it's pretty horrible without it.The scene where the shark busts through glass and and floods a control room is unforgettable. The super imposed shark is motionlessly floating toward the camera, and there are various shots of the characters inside in slow motion. I watched this with my mom and she thought something was wrong with the video, she didn't realize it was for dramatic effect until halfway through the scene. When the shark busts through the glass, some glass shatters and falls, the shark is still floating there completely still. This can be excused thanks to the shark's death scene, which is still tainted by effects that would only be slightly cool in 3-D. Bottom line, this is mediocre movie and can only be fun because it's so awful that it's funny. The better parts of the movie, is the fast paced second half, Dennis Quaid, Louis Gossett Jr. and seeing Lea Thompson in a swimsuit, which was probably the saving grace of the movie. I don't really recommend this movie, but if you're just that curious to see how low the series was falling then knock yourself out. The first and original movie was a masterpiece that never needed a sequel, the second one was still pretty good, this one bites and bears no resemblance to anything the previous ones offered, but then there's a fourth one.

The first film, released in 1975, was a pioneering blockbuster directed by Steven Spielberg. He passed on a sequel, and so Jaws 2 was directed by Jeannot Swarc. Generally considered inferior to the first, it nonetheless made a modest profit at the box office in 1978. Five years would pass before another sequel was made&#151;but perhaps it shouldn't have. 1983 saw a brief revival of 3-D films at the box-office, with minimal results. It was likely presumed that a 3-D Jaws would have more 'bite' to offer filmgoers. It didn't work.This time (directed by Joe Alves), the action moves from the New England town of Amity to a coastal Florida Sea World amusement park. The film damages its thematic credibility early on by prematurely aging the Brody boys, sons of Chief Brody of the first two Jaws films. Now the 30-ish Mike (played by Dennis Quaid in his 80's zenith) is an engineer/designer of underwater tunnel systems, with Sean college-aged and visiting his big brother for the summer. Bess Armstrong is Kathryn Morgan, the park's head marine biologist and Mike's love interest. Lea Thompson is Kelly, a ski-show performer and Sean's would-be girlfriend.Louis Gossett, Jr. (who had recently won an Oscar for his role in An Officer and a Gentleman) plays the flamboyant Calvin Bouchard, a New Orleans-reared businessman who has just recently taken over as the manager of the park. Fishy things start to happen when a great white shark apparently mauls an unsuspecting worker near the park's storm drainage tunnels.Enter Philip FitzRoyce, played by Simon MacCorkindale (TV's Manimal) an Australian wildlife photographer/hunter who offers to capture the rogue predator. He is successful, and Bouchard orders that the shark be put on display to seize on the publicity. His decision is questioned by Kathryn and Mike, the latter of whom knows all too well that great whites aren't anything to trifle with.Soon, the shark specimen dies&#151;however, the recently discovered remains of another shark victim indicate that they couldn't have been killed by the shark in custody&#151;this one would have to be much bigger. Shortly afterwards, the park staff (and their clientele) are face to face with the shark's mother&#151;over 30 feet in length and apparently feeling a maternal revenge instinct. From there, shark mayhem starts happening in a major way, as the murderous predator mauls its way through a ski-show exhibition, the bumper boat lagoon, and floods an observation tunnel. The shark is contained only temporarily, setting up the climax where viewers get to see a slow-motion reaction shot from the protagonists as the shark apparently has the presence of mind to charge headlong into an underwater control room to get at those pesky humans.Quaid is decent enough as a lead and Gossett is always a pleasure to watch, but despite their acting pedigrees this film is still strictly B-grade at best. It is unintentionally humorous that Sea World would lend its brand name to be potentially marred as vulnerable to shark invasion (technically, there are no coastal-based Sea World parks). Perhaps the show dolphins prominently featured in the film (another real-life park attraction) had something to do with the enticement&#151;though it would have been great if at least one of them were sacrificed to the shark. The special effects here are dated, and rendered muter for the fact that the 3-D effect has been removed. Certain scenes show objects heading straight for the camera (like a hypodermic needle, a crossbow bolt, shattered glass&#151;oh yes, and 'Bruce'). Minus the 3-D effect, unknowing viewers may question the odd choice of angles. Everyone except a Jaws completist should only rent this film.

This is a terrible shame, as it absolutely rocks.The whole thing is set in Sea World, and is a great advertisement for it, although it's been re-jigged to fit the plot- Sea World is in fact landlocked, so, sadly, there is no chance of any monster sharks getting in and mingling with the public.Mike Brody- the elder son of the Brody family- is visited by his younger brother Sean as he works at the park with his marine biologist girlfriend. Mike seems strangely unaffected by his bad experiences with sharks in Jaws 1 & 2, and is played by Dennis Quaid. Honestly, I think they could at least have given the guys dark hair to match them a little closer to the previous actors, but hey hey. Dennis was probably all like Don't mess with my highlights, man! There are shark attacks, and they catch a convenient scapegoat (scapeshark?) shark with the help of Simon MacCorkindale's arrogant wildlife photographer. This shark dies in captivity, and its mum comes to wreak revenge on the park- which it does in spectacular fashion. Does Mr MacCorkindale survive until the end of the movie? Well, he speaks of the shark with disrespect. Underestimates it. What do you think?Sean Brody is lucky enough to meet slutty waterski dolly Lea Thompson, but unlucky enough to be attacked by the water monster the minute he is persuaded to get into a boat.The whole film looks great, and moves fast- and the shark effects are terrific- they use a lot of real shark footage, and realistic models. In fact, this film out of the 4 probably has the best-looking sharks.The 3-D effects would probably be great if you got to see them properly, but unless you're lucky enough to catch a special viewing of the 3-D version, you're left wondering why so many things seem to point suggestively into the camera, and marvelling at the strange baroque effect of non-3-D 3-D, if you see what I mean. Things float around looking weird and disembodied- totally disconnected from the rest of the scene. But it's not altogether a bad thing.For me, this is a beautiful and exciting film- it's like a 70's disaster movie made in the 80's.

I bet it sounded like a doozy of a pitch back when some studio exec and the writers were talking about a third installment in the series. Imagine it a brand new set of characters (less money to pay in salary after Schieder turned down a part), a major endorsement from a well-known attraction (Sea World), the idea of one shark in a confined space with lots of sea life and people and the gimmick of 3-D. What could be better?Let's start, albeit briefly, with the 3-D gimmick. That's all it is, a gimmick. Let's face it when you shoot in 3-D, any future viewing in anything but 3-D is going to look pretty bad. It's obvious no one stopped to think about that in 1983. As I sat transfixed to the television for the entire 99-minute running time, I couldn't help but notice when a 3-D effect came onto the screen. The opening credit sequence, the fish head in the credits, the shark exploding through the underwater control room at the end, shark dentures floating through the lagoon&#133;all right, I'll stop. The point is viewing a 3-D movie in 2-D doesn't work.As if those weren't enough, anyone remotely familiar with the Jaws franchise would be ill to see what it has become. Mike Brody, in the course of five years, has gone from teenager to the buff Dennis Quaid. In the same time frame, young Sean has grown from a lad to a rather strapping college man. How that happens in the space of a couple years is beyond me. And then there's the obligatory mention of why Sean doesn't like the water. Apparently, his adventure in the last film coupled with his father's exploits have made the guy a little paranoid. Wonderful, great, completely reasonable. But, think about it Mike was with Sean in Jaws 2. Why does he take the job at Sea World instead of staying on solid ground? (Funnily enough, in the next film, Sean will wind up being a cop in Amity, only to meet his fate at the hands&#133;er, teeth, of another shark on the water.)Then there's the little fact of these shark's seeking out the Brody clan after the events in the first film. At one point, I had which shark in the family died in which movie all worked out. That was back when I had more time on my hands than I care to remember. This movie revolves around the 10-foot-long kid shark and the 35-foot-long mother. Extrapolating just a little bit, if the first movie's villain was the father, and the second was a son/daughter, then who, exactly, is after Mama Brody in the fourth? The flipping grandparents? You've got to be joking me. A family of shark's following around a family of people no matter where they go is insanely insipid. I'm not even going to point out the folly of diving into the water where you know there's a shark in the middle of the night, putting the shark on attraction, having an undersea control center and the absurd idea a shark can swim backward&#133;wait a second, I think I just did.

Mike (Dennis Quaid) is a senior executive at Sea World, where Sean (John Putch) visits after college. No Brody family reunion would be complete without a big ole shark to remind the boys and us of their glory days. Forcing its way into Sea World though an unsecured gate, the shark snacks on staff and coral poachers while the Brodies and their babes frolic in temporary ignorance, until it all hits the fan at the park's big opening.The concept isn't that terrible. It's what the writers and director Joe Alves do with it that boggles the mind with sheer stupidity. Watching Quaid and the other actors utter weird inanities that supposedly pass for normal conversation is odd enough, without the wince-inducing performance by Bess Armstrong as the park's whale and dolphin manager and Mike's girlfriend. She seems to have raided Sandy Duncan's medicine cabinet and taken all her peppy pills. Then there's Lea Thompson as Sean's sudden new girlfriend, who thinks nothing of stripping down and enticing her new man to take a swim.I bet I can overcome your childhood fears, she says, wading into the water in just her bra and panties.OK, I admit, that does sound pretty good. But take it from me, it's not. All you do is watch these cutesy scenes and wait like Captain Ahab for that big fish to show up. When it comes, it's not worth the wait.The shark attacks are filmed in such a ridiculous fakey way you feel insulted rather than scared. You get a rush of bubbles, someone ducking their head underwater, stock footage of some shark filmed in Australia, and that's it. Oh, yeah, and a detached arm, pointing out at the screen to take advantage of something called Arrivision 3D. The compositions are so stiff it hardly matters.The big stiff is the shark itself, alternately a matte shot of a still image moving with glacial slowness toward the camera, or a rubberized model so fake it actually folds when it rams into something. At one point, we see Armstrong's character wading in a pool with the shark, pretending to nurse it while she actually pushes it around the water like Bela Legosi did that rubber octopus. Would anyone with any ocean sense get in a pool with a Great White? Well, I guess yes if it's more likely to capsize than bite someone, as the case is here.I'd be remiss if I didn't call out Simon MacCorkindale, who plays a roguish English adventurer and gives Jaws 3 its one source of true charm.

It's the most ridiculous shot in a movie full of bad shots, more so as Alves for some reason plays it in slow motion.I think it was slow motion; it was hard to be sure. Everything in this movie runs so slow time loses all meaning after a while. Jaws 3 is such a bad movie it becomes kind of fun in a warped way to see what nutty tricks they pull next, something you can't say of a lot of halfway-decent films held down by competent directors and logical plots. I guess Jaws The Revenge is actually worse than this, based as it is on the idea of an actual vengeance-seeking shark seeking out the Brody clan. The silly fish needn't have bothered; Jaws 3 did a better job finishing them off than he ever could.

I think the idea of having a Jaws film in 3D is a stroke of genius &#150; the idea of having a shark pop out at the cinema audience must've seemed as if it was on par with the discovery of gravity or the founding of new land after a six month boat journey. Alas, since I saw this film in its 2D cousin format; I didn't get the thrill I'm sure I would've got had it been in three dimensions. Given this information, I'll give my opinions based on a 2D viewing as it's only fair.I think a lot of people have a problem with the film's effects. True, having the bottom of a submarine disappear into the background and then reappear as it turns around is a sure fire way of completely zoning your audience out of the reality of the film but if it had been in 3D, I'm sure it would've created cheers instead of jeers. I've seen a 3D film at an IMAX cinema and I can tell you it's a joy to behold to see things pop out at you. These things supposedly happen in Jaws 3D at well spaced times. The shark charges at you and glass flies at the screen, dolphins do their jumping and water sprays everywhere and as I've mentioned, a one man submarine swims around on a clear blue, water background but when you're viewing them on a television, it just looks like an absolute abomination, graphics wise.What I liked is the way the action is moved away from the beach and the film goes down a new route; moving away from the cop-come-suspicion-come-convincing act in a refreshing way. What Jaws 3D does do differently that I'm sure it wishes it hadn't consists of numerous things. For one, you don't need to be a marine biologist to know that sharks can't swim backwards. They did so in Deep Blue Sea (1999) but we were given reason &#150; they were genetically altered; but here, the shark just seems to feel like it &#150; so it does so. Arguably the worst continuity error in a film of all time. Secondly, the film follows the previous Jaws instalments by having the character bicker and argue for a while; in this case the conflict is distinctly put across through the English characters and the Americans as they talk about what they'll do. The English want to kill it and the Americans want to save it; keeping it for their park. A bit of a misrepresentation, if you ask me.Although there are some glaring errors throughout this film such as the shark swimming backwards and the fact it managed to break through a pane of glass that was obviously too thick since it's pressurised for being underwater. Not to mention the annoying and cheesy way the dolphins attempt to 'save the day', the film remains as an average action adventure piece that doesn't have brain cells but doesn't need them. People mark the film down for its effects but that's premature since they probably saw it on a 2D screen anyway. I thinks it's fitting how one character says to the other when they're discussing the equipment they use at the sea world park 'You build it and I swim in it.' The same could be said for Spielberg, his original Jaws film success and its predecessors sequels &#150; you build in it and we'll swim in it.

Jaws is a classic, Jaws II is a strong, worthy sequel but this drek is just so pathetic. Though I must say it's nowhere near as bad as the notorious Jaws The Revenge.In the space of 5 years the Brody kids have gone from kids to total grown-ups. Dennis Quaid is Michael and he now works at Sea World (one would imagine he would have a fear of the water by now) in Florida. They've just opened up their Undersea Kingdom (y'know those glass tunnels) and ignorant park owner Calvin Bouchard (Academy Award winner Louis Gosset Jnr. at the start of his downward spiral) is so full of himself he doesn't even realise a massive Great White Shark has snuck into the lagoon and plans to munch on divers, swimmers, skiers etc. Luckily for them a renegade naturalist (Simon MacCorkindale from TV's Casuality-looking EX-ACT-LEE like Thomas Jane) is hanging around to convince everyone that getting in the water to torment/trap/catch the poor beast is the best idea. His fate is firmly sealed as soon as he opens his mouth. Which is a bit of rip-off considering he risks his life many times through-out the film and Calvin Bouchard jeopardises so many but escapes un-eaten.The shark coverage is down right terrible. The underwater photography sucks and is badly spliced with stock footage of sharks that look nothing like the clumsy foam rubber monster in the close-ups. The 3-D effects come off as the WORST you will ever see. Even in plain-old 2-D you can see that they were pretty much the most unimaginative and unsubtle attempts at reaching the audience ever. Even the 3-D tricks in Friday the 13th Part 3 were much more fun and natural than this.I first saw Jaws III on ITV years ago. It's best to see it on the new DVD as the 2.351 picture adds loads to the sides of the frame for those of you who suffered the pan and scan video. Plus there is a few extra gory shots that ITV and some video releases saw fit to censor. But the picture quality is real nasty with some dirty grainy scenes and annoyingly soft focus others. The sound is simple Dolby Stereo but don't expect any Oscar winning sound mixes this time. Even John Williams shark theme is all but vanished and some guy called Alan Parker's score is generic and unengaged.Extra feature(s) consist of a trailer (methinks originally in 3-D shown before Friday the 13 Part 3 began, in the previous summer). And then there's something Universal call 'Recommendations'. Click on it and what do you get? Still photos of the DVD covers of the other Jaws movies. Duh, thanks! The only interesting thing about this film is the fact that Sea World actually allowed their name and logo to be defamed in such a ludicrous way. Jaws may have been born into greatness but it died very, very quickly as a franchise. Now Jason Voorhees has lasted much, much, MUCH longer and the first Friday the 13th film was hardly a masterpiece.Never underestimate the underdog.

I love JAWS and I am also quite a fan of its camp sequel JAWS 2. But this 'film' contained NONE of the elements which made its two predecessors great movies. The first mistake made by the screenwriter has to be, his decision to move the story from the open sea to an amusement park of some description (but I for one was far from amused.)The thing that truly frightened me about the first two films was that it was out there lurking in the vast deep ocean I live by the sea so this was an extra terrifying notion for me. This element is sadly no longer present in the franchise by the time JAWS 3-D rolls around. The Director, clearly has no respect for Peter Benchley or Steven Spielberg, nor does he possess any real skill as a filmmaker, This is apparent in the fact that for a movie about a giant killer shark, there isn't exactly an abundance of shark attacks, in fact, there's about two! No director who respected Benchley/Spielberg's vision would subject his/her audience to endless scenes of meaningless dialogue between characters that we really do not care about. The 'climax' of the film is what really does it for me though, the visual effects are simply laughable as the barely manoeuvrable shark 'storms' the park by smashing a bunch of windows, surely it could have done this earlier and saved us a whole 90 minutes of drawn out waffle. Not only are the effects bad, but the scene itself is just plain stupid. The fact that people underwater appear to be running from a shark, and the man who is eaten does not surface once but somehow manages to scream! Priceless. Well, that's about it.

It's hard to imagine the second such ill-advised cash-in being the exception to the rule. Indeed, from the tackiness of its gimmicky premise (the film is begging for a midnight re-release now that 3D has eclipsed cinemas to an extent that would knock 1980s producers out of their seats) and value- judgment name-related puns being all too easy (3/10, or 'D' grade &#x96; take your pick), preconceptions of Jaws 3-D are inevitably more akin to a roast than a viewing. Surely, audiences are gonna need a bigger drink.At first, the film's notoriety doesn't disappoint. The hokey script and asinine dialogue (inconceivably penned by Richard Matheson and Carl Gottlieb, from Jaws The First) are barely audible due to the collective laziness of muddy sound mixing and the hilariously uncommitted performances of the cast. Audiences are forced to be so active in connecting the dots to make sense of character relationships, motivations, plot, and causality that it recalls that opacity of a neorealist art film, albeit with none of the artistry. There's also the odd sense that director Joe Alves (helming his first, and, wisely, last film here) has a hankering for the eerie surrealism of early Hammer horror cinema, as each shark attack, after a momentarily tense buildup, quickly devolves into a phantasmagoria of surreal red lights, choppy cinematography and editing, and distorted, echoing sound &#x96; a technique that is, unsurprisingly, far more bemusing than thrilling. So far 3/10 sounds about right. But then, roughly two thirds of the way through the film, there is a subtly discernible shift, as if cast and director groggily awoke from a drunken stupor and collective decided to start trying. Maybe the exhilaration of the film's (genuinely stirring) third act twist (there's always a bigger fish) was contagious, but, before you know it, the film's final third becomes a deceptively engaging thriller. The film's fairly clever shark in an enclosed theme park premise &#x96; oddly prophetic of Jurassic Park, of all things &#x96; is finally utilized towards thrills instead of an excuse to parade around pyramids of waterskiing girls in bikinis, and the blending of live shark footage and rickety animatronics is even vaguely commendable and seamless, adding to the cursory thrills. Alves' background as production designer definitively comes in handy, as the creative tapestry of underwater viewing tunnels makes for some surprisingly tense and engaging shark showdowns. We're still not even grasping at the gills of Spielberg's classic, but hey &#x96; at this point, we'll take it. Yes, the oooOOOOoohh 3D!! shots are about as forced and tacky as you'd imagine (as are the script's awkward attempts at positioning the film within the Jaws Brody lineage), but their antiquated clumsiness brings a certain kitschy pleasure of its own. It's also easy to leer at the film as a distasteful ad for Sea World (curiously, the Sea World of the film is a far more elaborate fictitious counterpart, so eager audiences would be disappointed seeking it out in real life). That said, there's something so gleefully subversive about promoting a theme park by advertising it as grounds for a disastrous bloodbath that it's easy to let this slide. For your 'spot the pre-fame star' viewing pleasure, Dennis Quaid is amiably noncommittal in the Roy Scheider 'charismatic blue-collar rogue' archetype, and fun to watch whether ironically or not. Bess Armstrong gives a surprisingly impressive performance as the passionate Sea World marine biologist (it's really a shame her career didn't gain more trajectory &#x96; if she shows this much promise here, imagine her working with a half-decent script). She and Quaid share a endearing, effectively playful chemistry, and by the end it's unexpectedly hard not to root for their romance to succeed in spite of workplace politics and shark massacres alike. Supporting them, Simon MacCorkindale's aping of Peter O'Toole as a cocky wildlife photographer is alternatively irritating and amusing, and Louis Gossett Jr. is fun throughout as Sea World's quirky CEO, while the excellently named P.H. Moriarty generates the film's most consistently genuine moments of emotion as MacCorkindale's grim DP. Don't be misled by the vaguely positive bent here Jaws 3-D's notoriety as a campsterpiece is merited, but it has a few tricks up its sleeve (fin...?) to boot, and it's effectively Oscar-worthy compared to the deliriously execrable part four. Jaws 3-D is without question worth watching for a laugh, and, if the third act results in becoming strangely invested and even the stray thrill here and there, all the better.

Too bad, because this fun-but-not-great movie could have been much better. Jaws 3D might just get better rating if it was revised in HD with some of the 3D cuts removed (Or a 3D version- Yes!). Jaws 3D is also quite different in both tone and style from the other films. Both Jaws 1 and 2 seem to focus on being trapped on the open sea, Jaws 3D is more claustrophobic-based.

It's even a step down from the disastrous Jaws 2, and yet another insult to Spielberg's original, which remains one of the most enduring thrillers ever made. But the Bottom 100? At the time of this writing, Jaws 3 stands at #71 on the IMDb's list of the 100 worst movies ever made, as judged by us, the users. While the movie was certainly ridiculous, it is NOT the 71st worst movie ever made. Maybe this is just a numbers thing, but if movies like Nightmare Weekend and Graveyard Shift (1987) are not on that list, the Jaws 3 definitely does not deserve to be.What it DOES deserve, however, is a good shellacking for being such a mess. Jaws 3. interestingly enough, continues more on Jaws 2 than the original Jaws. Jaws 2 at least had the sense to go for creating some of the tension and atmosphere that made the original such a success, while things like the shark turning into a run-of-the-mill movie monster were merely by-products. Jaws 3 takes that descent of the shark from predator to monster and runs with THAT. You can see some of the budding ideas that led to Deep Blue Sea (another stupid shark movie) in Jaws 3, as the shark takes on abilities to roar, swim backwards, swim through the reinforced glass and into the underwater control room, hide itself, and basically hunt like a human. The shark acts so unnatural in this movie that by the end I wouldn't have been surprised if it pulled out a shotgun and started shooting at people.On the plus side, they at least avoided something stupid like have the shark smile, but then again they couldn't resist having a dolphin frantically shaking it's head 'no' while a couple of diving humans search the sunken Spanish Galleon, bringing themselves dangerously close to the shark. Please. It's things like this that earn the movie worse ratings from the people than it deserves. Indeed, at least one person has pointed out a goof that's not really a goof. When the tour guide is leading people out of the Undersea Kingdom, it's not the green screen set that you can clearly see, but simply the outline of the portion of the Kingdom that they had been standing in.What no one has pointed out, however, is that when they were loading up poison to shoot at the shark, one person fills a syringe and then squirts out probably half of the poison that had been pulled into the syringe, wasting half of it and promptly demonstrating a massive lack of understanding of why that's done in the first place. You point the syringe straight up, flick it to release any air bubbles from the sides, then squeeze until it squirts to make sure there is no air in it. In humans, a single air bubble could mean a stroke and death, in the shark, the more ways to kill it the merrier. Besides, the syringe was held at an angle, and you can clearly see a gigantic pocket of air in it. I've never given an injection in my life and even I know that.(spoilers) In the movie's defense, at least it had a mildly interesting premise. Mike Brody, from Jaws 2, has grown into a strapping young man and works, fittingly enough, at Sea World. He's got this girlfriend with whom he has a goofy movie relationship, she's the dolphin trainer. Much of the first half of the movie is dedicated to showing a couple of dolphins do a lot of jumps and flips, then they disappear completely from the film during the shark portion, and then are cheered at the end for still being alive. One no name dolphin is munched during the course of the movie, but it appears in the movie only long enough to be eaten so it doesn't matter.The movie is probably now best known for being the first, and only, Jaws movie released in 3-D, a cute effect which does not translate well to video. Given the logistics of providing a home video in 3-D, they had no choice but to remove the 3-D effects and release it as a normal film. I really would like to have seen it in 3-D, because it is clear that the filmmakers put more stock in this effect than anything else in the movie. The 3-D scenes stick out like sore thumbs, not just because the movie stops completely in its tracks every time one arrives so that it can linger on screen and audience members can reach out in front of them and try to touch things, but because these scenes on video are so badly computer generated that it's almost funny. And they were right to put a lot of stock into the 3-D effects, because as is now obvious, without them the movie falls on its face as soon as the opening credits. In theaters, these credits may have jumped off the screen and wowed audiences. On video, they do nothing but cover up the water ski pyramid that you're trying to watch. Initially meant to be the first oohs and aahs of the movie, now they simply get in the way of one of the only impressive things in the entire movie.Another stupid thing from Jaws 2 that is added upon here is that Jaws 2 was a stupid teen horror movie, and this one goes for the same cast of stupid teenagers. Granted, they're all older than the kids in the Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street movies, but consider the bar scene. They entertain themselves by getting drunk and then trying to push each other over in ludicrous games like Standoff, and even worse, consider the scene where Lea Thompson's character, Kelly, is wooed by Sean Brody, who tricks her in a game of Standoff, takes her back to his table, and proceeds to hit on her in the most stupefying way imaginable. The only thing more shocking about how un-charming he is is that Kelly just devours it. With flirting like that going on, we don't need a shark. Humans will go extinct on their own.On the plus side, the following morning provides the only truly funny line in the movie, when Mike Brody offers Sean a cup of coffee ('Just throw it in my eyes, it will work faster.'). Unfortunately, the movie cheapens itself by showing a badly decomposed (and pathetically fake-looking) body of a shark attack victim. Remember the autopsy scene from the original? Not a drop of blood and still leaps and bounds more effective than this. The ballasts attached to the shark are back for this installment, but the spirit of the movies is gone. It is nowhere near the classic thriller of the original, but simply a bad b-horror movie. And by the way, what ever happened to the music??

The owner of the park (Louis Gossett Jr) is preparing to open it when a shark is discovered trapped in the park. The marine biologists (played by Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong) discover it is a baby shark trapped and they aim to raise it in captivity. Unfortunately, they haven't counted on the mother of the shark....The 3-D does work OK and inevitably, there are some of the predictable dimensional shots that you can see a mile off, but it is passable entertainment and, as directed by JAWS production designer Joe Alves (coming off ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK) it is enjoyable enough.

So after we got the first two Jaws movies, we got to have another one as this franchise keeps milking itself and this time it has gone to a third dimension. Yes, this movie was entirely shot in 3D during the 80s, and I hate to tell you this, I have never saw this movie as it was originally shot. I only saw this in 2D only, and I don't think that Universal Studios wouldn't bother to reissue this movie on Blu Ray with the 3D version. Also, I don't know how good the 3D version is, and I really don't know if it makes the movie a little better. So, what do I know about? So speaking of 3D, the movie is about another great white shark attacking more people, but this time it is attacking at a theme park known as Sea World (I'll admit that I actually like having a shark attacking at Sea World, but that is not saying much). Also, we have Martin Brody's son working at Sea World as he tries to protect the tourist from getting attack by a shark. So, that is what the plot of the third movie is, and I think its really lame. The characters aren't really that interesting, and nothing much to their personalities. However, I do like some of the actors in this movie like Dennis Quad, Bess Armstrong and Lea Thompson but their performances don't save the movie. I really don't care much of the rest of the cast, and really don't have much comment of their acting. Heck, really don't care for the music at all. Joe Alves, who was the production designer of the first two Jaws movies was chosen to direct this movie, and I really don't think he is really that capable on making a good Jaws movie. Again, about the 3D, I don't know if that version is better than 2D, but I do say that the 3D effects are very cheesy looking. The shark itself looks fine as it was all done practical, but the real life footage is hardly used in this movie because of the use of 3D. Even that one part, where the shark comes to break the glass slowly which I find it laughable. The movie does have some laughable moments like some tourist push a girl to the glass, where there is a dead man outside underwater. Also, the British guy's buddy yelling so loud by how much he has been overreacting. One scene in the movie, where you have two thugs that are trying to steal coral, which I think it should have been cut out because its adds absolutely nothing to the movie. Very pointless, if you think about it. I don't have much comment about the pacing, but it is 99 minutes and really can't comment if this movie bores me or not. So I'll let you be the judge of that on your own views of the movie, but if you enjoy it for its silliness that is fine. To me, there is nothing much to recommend that this movie is so bad its good, so I say that its just bad. Jaws 3-D is lame and silly, and I personally give it a 2 out of 10.

Not so much the Hunting of the Snark, but the Hunting of the Shark! If you see what I mean.There is, in fact so much non-stop nonsense that it gets a bit overwhelming at times. The shark is about as lifelike as a rubber shark can get, but towards the end there are some especially dire effects of the shark with its head stuck in the control room window. The stop-motion animation of the tail is extremely bad - you'll see better on most kids animated puppet shows - and the tail doesn't so much sweep back and forth as just twitch inanely. Of course, how it got stuck in the window is almost as hilarious. In 3D it might have looked OK, but on a TV screen (no matter how big) the shark just seemed to drift up to window with all the menace (and realism) of a bath toy shark. This scene 's hilarity was compounded by the looks of absolute horror on the faces of the control room occupants. Priceless! No matter how much you want to turn off, it's worth waiting to see this scene alone.Of course, the general physics is just as abused as the shark info. A grenade goes off underwater, not twenty feet from a couple of divers and they're not even stunned a tiny amount - no burst eardrums at all. Bah! Who cares if water is virtually incompressible!

Three years after the film's release came Jaws 2 which wasn't as scary and effective as its predecessor. Nevertheless, it made money, and the franchise distributor Universal wanted to make another Jaws film. Five years after Jaws 2 came Jaws 3-D. This time the filmmakers did something different. They threw in 3-D effects to conjure up scares. Why did they do this? I think it was due to the success of Friday the 13th Part 3 which was released in 3-D a year earlier. That movie made money, and the makers of Jaws 3-D were hoping to cash in on the 3-D craze that was supposed to be big in 1983. During this particular year, a mess of 3-D movies came out. In addition to Jaws 3-D there was the sci-fi adventure Spacehunter Adventures in the Forbidden Zone which starred Molly Ringwald (before Breakfast Club); Metalstorm The Destruction of Jared-Syn, another sci-fi movie featuring Richard Moll (before TV's Night Court) and Kelly Preston (before she became Mrs. John Travolta); the comedy The Man Who Wasn't There starring Steve Guttenberg (before the Police Academy and Cocoon movies); and Amityville 3-D, the third in the series about a haunted house which featured Meg Ryan in one of her early film roles. Jaws 3-D was the most successful movie of this bunch, but that didn't say much. The 3-D craze didn't go into 1984 like it was predicted. In fact, all these movies got horrible reviews from critics and people stayed away from them. However, I went to see Jaws 3-D when I was only 12 years old. I really didn't know a whole lot about 3-D at the time. I was told that it was a device in a movie where things come at you. When I was going to see Jaws 3-D I, along with my mother and a friend were given those special 3-D glasses which you had to wear if you wanted to see the 3-D effects. I put the glasses on, then the movie started. It was one of the most awesome experiences I ever had while seeing a movie on the big screen. I had never seen anything like it. But that was just a one time experience. They don't make movies like this anymore, so I haven't been able to experience a 3-D movie since. Jaws 3-D is the only movie I ever went to see that was filmed in 3-D. At that time I didn't care if the movie was critically bad and poorly made. I went to see it and had a good time. And on the basis of that one time movie going experience, I give Jaws 3-D three stars. But (and this is a big but), on home video and on TV the movie is knows simply as Jaws III. The 3-D effects don't come at you on the small screen as they did on the big screen. And that's disappointing. Jaws 3-D was only memorable for its 3-D effects, but since the effects don't come at you on the small screen, Jaws III is forgetable. And that's the version you'll be seeing of this movie from here on out. So I can only give Jaws III two stars.** (out of four)   "},{"Title":"Just Boring","Date":"17 November 2014","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" There are some good things to this film, like the kick-ass musical score, and the creative choice of having it take place at Sea World.

The sons of Roy Scheider's Chief Brody character, Mike and Sean, take center stage. Mike and girlfriend Kathryn Morgan are marine biologists at a Seaworld theme park. They discover a baby shark, which happened to be trapped inside the park, and later perishes. To their surprise, the scientists also discover that its 35-foot mother, a huge Great-White shark, is also trapped inside and is hungry; therefore, they try to evacuate Seaworld before any casualties strike.The special effects were bit of a downgrade from the first two movies, with the shark's execution being less realistic and horrific; in some scenes, you could hear the animatronics and machinery that the crew used to operate the animal. Alan Parker did a fine job on the music score, I think, and also incorporated John Williams' famous shark theme.While this film was pretty much slammed by many critics and viewers, even garnering several Razzie Award nominations, I actually thought the movie was exciting and more fun to watch than Jaws II. Having the setting inside a water theme park rather than the usual beaches in a small town is a neat idea, and seeing the Seaworld workers reacting to the idea that a huge Great White is inside the park, where thousands of visitors are, and trying desperately to find a plan to evacuate the park and capture the shark is suspenseful. The acting is descent and plot is fast-paced. Director Joe Alves did a pretty good job making the movie.There are more surprises and thrilling moments, I think, than in the previous movie. My favorite scene is the part where the Great White swims toward the viewing glass from the park's control room, puncturing the glass, letting water rush in and sending every person inside swimming for their lives.Overall, Jaws III doesn't match the original film in fright and shock value, but is what I think the better of the three sequels.Grade B "},{"Title":"Water thorn","Date":"26 June 2009","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" The sexy shark swam on by, catching me by the eye.

To put it in perspective the number 14 movie Scarface also was released threw Universal was allowed to run for 3 months, despite and X rating and only made slightly more money, and was a PR nightmare for the Studio. Why is this?First of all the producers of Jaws and Jaws 2 refused to get involved because they wanted this sequel to be a Comedy. Secondly Joe Alves the second unit director of 1 and 2 (the guy that does all the non dramatic hard work like stunts and sharks) was given this project as a debut. Most directors don't get a big budget debut, so this must have really ruffled the feathers of Alve's former bosses. So we know the rest, it was released, made a bunch of money, and to mend fences with the original Jaws hot Shots Universal yanked it. After all they just wanted the money.And it's really a shame because a lot of hard work went into this movie. I categorically dismiss the criticism about the special effects of anybody who didn't see this movie in 3D the way it was meant to be seen. The arguments that the brody boy's leap frog from kids in Jaws 2 (released in 78) to where they are in this movie (Released in 83) is equally idiotic. Nowhere is it stated or even implied that this movie actually takes place in the year it was released.The cast is Great with the exception of Quaid, who lacks chemistry with Bess armstrong who really nailed her role, so he should have been replaced. Alan Parkers re-scoring is great, and who can complain about getting to see a young Leah Thompson in a bikini.It's a shame politics get in the way of artistic expression, the critics are always there, but supply drives demand, a movie can't be successful if it get's yanked.

And it's up to Mike Brody (played expertly by Dennis Quaid) and a motley assortment of marine experts to stop it. While the story is compelling and exciting, everything just feels like a re-tread. Like a Xerox copy of a Xerox copy. The formula that worked so well the first time got faded a bit by JAWS 2 and faded even further with this one. As for the 3-D effects, many look so darn fake. The most laughable of which is the stationary image of the shark as it swims toward an underwater command center. It's so unfortunate, because there are genuinely good performances in this by not only Quaid, but also Bess Armstrong, Louis Gossett Jr, and a young Lea Thompson.

What they don't plan on is a greedy,Great White shark terrorizing the theme park,or menacing the people.Like I couldn't have figured that out by myself with the title.It's called Jaws 3-D isn't it?The first victim ends up being a guy who is repairing the dolphins' pens.He is suddenly attacked and pulled under water,and isn't seen again until much later.No one at Sea World bothers trying to find him or put out a search party,not that I can recall.A shark is seen trying to cause trouble,and attacks some people before it is captured.They put it on display,thinking they've stopped the attacks.But while the guy and girl are being lovey dovey and yaking,they forget to rehabilitate animal.The shark isn't used to being in a tank,so it starts to suffocate.Despite their attempts to save it,it turns over and drowns in front of a group of tourists.This was so stupid of them.If something like that happened in real life,the big cheeses at SW would've had their jobs.They soon discover that the shark that they had in captivity was a baby,and the mother is really mad they took it.A few days later,a badly decaying body swings side to side in front of a window,where tourists look at various wild, sea creatures.Upon examination of the decaying corpse,they discover the shark is twice the size of the one they caught.They assume it was the little shark's mother.They assume this from the way the skin and muscle was ripped cleanly off the front half of the body.First of all,how do you know that the killer shark is the mother,and not the big brother or sister?Second,if that had been a real decaying corpse,it would've been picked clean by scavengers; like crabs for instance.Third,the body would've been swept out to sea,and would've turned up on shore many months later.And the huge gaping wound doesn't even look right at all,it looks like something sawed off the flesh and muscle.Was the corpse/mannequin stolen from the set of Texas Chainsaw massacre 2 or 3?And since when did a mother shark ever cared for its baby?The shark pups are on their own after they're born.Did they get their information from a 4 year old?What a waste of film.The characters are never fully developed,so we don't have a reason to really care about them.The 3-D effects without the special glasses,look cheaply done.The scene where it is crashing through a large TV monitor,makes it look like a large, rubber shark head that smashes through;and stands still.It just looks so obvious that the shark is fake,and someone had tossed the glass right beside it.Not worth my time I wasted on this stupidity.Watch it for only the scene with the water skiers doing the pyramid,and the shark going after them.That,and the scene where the people get scared of the monstrosity, trying to ram shatter proof glass in a restaurant.

Now, before I watched this film I often wondered to myself, Why don't they put great white sharks in aquariums? After watching 'Jaws 3' I knew the answer. It's not because they die in captivity, it's because they always end up escaping and lots of people die. Oh, did I say lots? Because hardly anyone dies.'Jaws 3''s effects are, to put it bluntly, crappy. The film was originally presented in 3-D, which means you have several shots in which the shark model begins to move towards you on the screen. Now, effective this MIGHT have been in 3-D, watched on a normal television the whole thing looks hilarious. You have this completely UNMOVING model increasing in size on the screen and it's about as scary as 'Book of Shadows'. Ie not very.So should you watch 'Jaws 3'? Well, if you want a case study for the deteriorating effects sequels have, then by all means. If you want a decent film, steer clear. The acting is forgettable, the effects moreso. This is not a good B-Movie. A good B-Movie is 'Tremors'. 'Jaws 3' is to 'good movies' what 'Joss Whedon' is to 'talented.' Three out of ten.

After they capture a small Great White shark, it's gigantic mother (!) comes looking for it, and wreaks havoc on the park.  It's up to Quaid, his marine biologist girlfriend (Bess Armstrong) and a cocky underwater photographer (Simon MacCorkindale, from TV's Manimal) to stop it.  Decent performances are no match for a dreadful screenplay and some of the worst special effects ever seen in a major motion picture.

The original 3D effects are pretty obvious, except that in the non-3D version, the ones that were filmed as bluescreen shots look absolutely horrible, while the non-bluescreen ones just look silly. In one shot, a chunk of a submersible boat actually disappears before our eyes. I can only assume it didn't look that way in the 3D version, or they never would have left the shot in.Criticizing the plot seems almost beside the point. I mean, yet another huge killer shark (this makes number 3!) shows up, this time in Florida, where former two-time huge-killer-shark-attack victim Mike Brody just happens to be working at Sea World? Give me a break.I can't imagine why the Sea World people thought this was a good idea. The movie is atrocious, and makes Sea World look just awful in every possible way. On the other hand, if the movie had been really good, it would have made Sea World look like a terrifying place where visitors can easily become a shark's dinner. The idea behind this truly escapes me.I have to admit that the cable-TV version I watched was even worse than it had any right to be, since the filmmakers' incompetence was at least tripled by a horrible videotape transfer, appalling sound, and perhaps the worst pan-and-scan I have ever encountered.

Everybody was very excited because soon Sea World's newest attraction, Undersea Kingdom, which were four plexiglass tunnels that go 40 feet under the water so tourists can get a look at marine life up close, would be opening soon. The park's owner, Calvin Bouchard, was also excited that Australian governor Philip Fitzroyce was visiting. The only problem was a faulty sea gate in back and foreman Michael Brody (the son of former Amity police chief Martin Brody) looked on. His girlfriend, Kathryn Morgan, was Shamu's trainer. Later, Mike's brother Sean came in to help. Mike introduced him to one of his friends, Kelly, and the two just hit it off. That night, a crew member, Shelby Overman, went under the water to try and fix the gate when suddenly he was attacked by...Yes, a shark! Two bumbling coral thieves were also attacked by the shark.       In the morning, Mike Brody, along with Mrs. Overman wonder what became of Shelby so Mike and Kathryn take a small submarine down to look for him and are nearly attacked by a shark. Luckily, it was two dolphins to the rescue. When they surface, Mike and Kathryn tell Calvin about the shark. Kathryn thought they should capture it and put it in captivity but Philip thought they should kill it on camera and get media attention. Calvin sided with Kathryn so they successfully caught the shark!       Next day marked the opening of Undersea Kingdom! Tourists from all around came to see it. They also came to see the shark, who soon died. That shark was actually a baby Great White, which meant it's mother, Mama Jaws, 35 feet of terror, was close by. She found her way into the park and proceeded to attack every human she could get her jaws on. She even tried to get the people in the Undersea Kingdom, so when they tried to escape, the safety doors closed, trapping them down there with limited air. Philip tried to get Mama Jaws to go out the gate, but he was sadly attacked. Mike and Kathryn worked hard to free the trapped people and all seemed well again, until Mama Jaws actually crashed through the glass window to the control room, flooding it. Just then, Mike and Kathryn noticed Philip's corpse sticking out Mama Jaws' mouth, so thinking quick, Mike managed to pull the pin on the grenade Philip was holding and KABOOM! In an explosion of blood and body parts, Mama Jaws was gone for good. Mike and Kathryn surface in triumph.        What can I say? Jaws 3 is the worst in the series. It was a real groaner! I liked Jaws 1. I liked Jaws 2 even better, but Jaws 3, ugh! It was a good idea, though, but it just didn't play well. Bad acting from all except Louis Gossett Jr., he was pretty good and Lea Thompson was a real hottie! I hear Jaws 3's sequel, Jaws The Revenge, was even worse, although I haven't seen it yet. Jaws 3 was originally in 3-D, so the 3-D effects look stupid now that it's pressed down to 2-D video version. Anyway, in conclusion, even diehard Jaws fans should skip this one!

After seeing the second one, I was a little disappointed, but I still enjoyed better than other films I'd seen.      Then I saw this movie-if you want to call it that. What I would call this piece of garbage is a waste of film and a major waste of a good idea. Deep Blue Sea illustrates the idea of sharks attacking an underwater facility much better than Jaws 3-and I hated Deep Blue Sea anyway.     Here's what happens. A huge theme park is about to open, and its main attraction is an undersea kingdom where people go to see fish and reefs (Like we've never heard that before). Soon, though, the doors to the undersea kingdom are mysteriously opened, and guess what happens to be in the area and swim inside? A harmless little sea otter? No. A shark! Soon afterward (after skipping sensual activity involving mike and shawn brody with their girlfriends) the shark is killing everybody in sight, but then mike's girl decides to capture the thing and keep it in captivity. Sounds great, huh? NOT! Soon, the shark somehow dies (go figure) and then before we're aware of anything else, another one (the first shark's mother) is attacking the undersea kingdom and destroying everything!     There are three major things that I thought could have made this movie much better the story, the characters, and the shark itself. The story was amazingly lame. It doesn't even take us back to Amity, and that was the highlight of the first two films. Even though it was probably a good idea to change the story and not just keep having the same plot over and over and over that the shark comes in, kills people, then Martin Brody (who was mysteriously absent from this film) destroys it, they shouldn't have started a whole new setting with new characters. And that leads me into the second part the characters. The first film had three stars playing great roles Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss, and Roy Scheider as Quint, Hooper and Brody. As the second Jaws came about, only Scheider returned in the trio of great actors. And by the third movie he was gone. The only good actor in this movie was Dennis Quaid as Mike Brody. Tchh...and the last part was the rubber-I mean great white shark. But seriously, it looked so stupid I couldn't believe it. The bad shark in the first Jaws was ok, because they didn't have the special effects that we do today. But eight years later, technology had improved, but they still only used the same shark robot.

They surprise us in how they eventually evolve as the story comes to its inevitable conclusions...What we may initially perceive as the secondary Villain (the manager of this aquatic theme park, Calvin), turns out to be just an ordinary person at a loss for words, and tries his best to save the endangered tourists trapped underwater.  Unlike the previous two films (in which we're subjected to the pig-headed-ness of one dollar-hungry Mayor), Calvin made me laugh when I realized his character was just all attitude and 'talk.'  He is speechless when everybody realizes they have a serious situation on their hands 35 feet of man-eating death!The heroes (God save what's left of their present acting careers!) also prove brave and honorable.My favorite character, however, was the calm and rational female tour guide that succeeded in 'tranquilizing' the trapped visitors until rescue divers could successfully bail them out.  Here you have this short lady telling the much taller adults and children to conserve their energy and air, so that escape seems all the more possible.Brief Review J2 was pretty much along the same lines as its original... except here we have a regatta of mostly teens and twenty-somethings trying to stay afloat, and the shark in question keeps getting bigger by the time we reach J4.J4 stinks and sinks!

But in the tradition of a lot of Hollywood sequels, this third big fish entry is even more ludicrous than the second, and of course nowhere near as believably frightening as the first.Dennis Quaid stars as Mike Brody, who is now employed at Florida's Undersea Kingdom.  His younger brother Sean (John Putch) has the same problems with hydrophobia that their father once had, a fear that is amply justified when he goes to visit Quaid in Florida, and a shark enters the park's submarine tubes, killing three employees before being anaesthetized by Quaid and the park's chief itchycologist (Bess Armstrong).  What neither they nor the park's manager (Louis Gossett Jr.) know is that its mother is coming for its young one.  The result is the expected panic and a shark destruction scene that tops the one in JAWS 2 by leaps and bounds for its sheer ludicrousness.Even though it was originally shown in 3-D, JAWS 3 still isn't very good.  Sure, it has Quaid, Armstrong, Gossett, and even an early appearance by Lea Thompson.  But all of that goes for naught because of the stiff direction of Joe Alves (the production designer on the first two films, and associate producer on JAWS 2) and the unusually lame script by Richard Matheson (of DUEL and Twilight Zone fame) and Carl Gottlieb (who co-wrote the first two movies).

Certainly, it isn't a great film like the original Jaws, but it is what I consider a decent sequel and an enjoyable movie that works and that is much better than much of what passes for good movies, presently.Although the basic premise of a monster eating people is extremely old, I think the plot formed around this idea is rather clever and intriguing - a great white breaking into Sea World.Many of the film's critics bash the film for the unrealistic scenario of having a mother Great White follow its baby and seek revenge for the baby's death, and by criticizing it thus, they are showing their own stupidity.If such critics actually spent some time paying attention to the film instead of trying to feel superior, they would realize that the mother shark breaks into Sea World and gives birth there. Also, the mother completely ignores the baby (realistically). It isn't the baby's capture and death that sets the mother off - it's the decision to shut off the water pumps that provide it with its oxygen supply in the place where it was lurking that causes it to finally start exploring the park.Also, the special effects are damn good for an 80's flick and are much better than lame CGI in modern films. Sure, CGI has the capability of being realistic, but that capability hasn't been reached yet.This is a fine film that deserves more credit than it is given. I only hope that its poor reputation doesn't prevent Universal from giving it a good DVD release.

The premise sees biologists Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong capturing a great white shark to hold at Florida's Seaworld.  However, the manager (Louis Gosset Jr.) makes a careless decision and the shark dies.  Within hours, the shark's mammoth-sized mother has arrived on the scene for bloodthristy revenge.  Dan, on the previous page, clearly stated the mystery of Carl Gottleib, co-writer of Jaws and Jaws II, coming up with this idea.  Actually, it probably seemed a good idea at the time which explains the presence of such established stars like Quaid and Gosset Jr.  But, it turned out to be a thumbs-down.  The film is daft and unexciting and relies more on blood and guts coming out of the screen than on suspense.  The shark is bigger but no match for the two that took residence at Amity, it looks fake, roars and swims (or rather crawls) at a snails-pace and misses out on most of its potential-victims due to its clumsiness.  But, of course, its just a model and so the direction is really to blame.  Fortuanately, its quite fast-paced so watching it doesn't really do any harm.  Its just a big shame that Joe Alves has taken things so far off the rails.

The story in this one is that Dennis Quaid plays the now adult son of Roy Scheider, whom played the police chief in the first two films. Quaid takes a job working at Sea World in Orlando, and begins to strike up a romance with Bess Armstrong, a dolphin trainer and biologist at the water park. A maintenance worker gets mangled and killed in a late night attack by a baby great white. When the young shark is discovered, it is captured with plans to exploit it for more tourist dollars. Then the baby dies. And momma gets ticked. Very ticked. When Momma shows up, I have to say that the deaths are done well. Especially the poor guy whom gets chewed up, and we see (and hear) the carnage from WITHIN momma shark's mouth.The rest of the movie follows Quaid, Armstrong, and a few other noteworthy thespians such as Lou Gosset Jr., and Lea Thompson, as they try to outwit the momma shark's vengeful streak. This movie was released in the middle of the 3-D revival of 1983, and several scenes are effective (the floating arm comes to mind), but many are just window dressing (the submersibles), or just painfully goofy (the shark approaches the camera head on, but DOES NOT swish it's tail back and forth as it swims. The shark looks like a plastic toy moving on a track!)Just forget the earlier two films, and just turn your brain on auto-pilot, and you'll enjoy this film just fine. I just have one question, to anybody whom may know... When I first saw the film in the mid 80's on BETAMAX (!!!), the title logo of JAWS III was animated in a cool red and yellow 1950's scifi lettering style, and they chomped at the viewer to the accompaniment of a rocket-like swooshing sound and a loud CHOMP!!! Viewing a videocassette made in the mid 90's, the swooshing sound is there, the CHOMP sound effect is there, but the cool 3-D animated logo is gone. It is replaced by a still frame of Jaws III.

Note the meteoric increase in the usage of 3-D in theme parks.  Jaws 3-D, while not the best 3-D presentation, was an amazing sight to behold theatrically as every object imaginable, from viscera to killer whales, was thrust at the audience in widescreen.  Youngsters in the audience even tried to push away an approaching fish-head and inadvertently hit the patrons in front of them. The impact of Jaws 3-D has been greatly diminished by home video and the film's strengths are all but lost as the 3-D cinematography has been converted for regular viewing and cropped to fit the TV screen.  All that remains is the worst aspects of the film and Jaws 3-D is indeed horrible. A hideous mix of appalling dialogue, torturous music, and garish special-effects that would not appear even remotely real to a toddler. Yet, the film is a triumph.  A trash masterwork of misguided imagination, heedless financing, and erroneous melodrama.  If a film could ever be obnoxiously over-the-top and enjoyable for just that reason, Jaws 3-D is that film!  The film's entire premise is shockingly weak, unbelievable and laughable.  The music is pretentious and annoyingly repetitive, with the same basic theme duplicated throughout the entire film with little or no alteration.  The special-effects are flamboyant, fake, and insanely inconsistent.  The shark changes size whenever it's convenient for the filmmakers, varying from a plausible size of 20-feet to a ridiculous size of 35-feet.  The shark is extremely slow moving, growls, and has a large fleshy appendage in its mouth that appears to be a tongue. All this despite the fact that sharks don't have vocal cords or tongues.  In the film, a character somehow eludes the shark's oversized plastic teeth and is subsequently pulsated to death with the tongue.  We see this scene alongside the victim from inside the shark's mouth while the soundtrack plays a strange cacophony of music, crunching noises, intestinal bellows and what sounds like moans of orgasm.  If this moronic scene sounds tolerable, Jaws 3-D is a film to be enjoyed.  A film filled with many more inane, crass visual gags optimized by the 3-D medium, such as floating severed extremities, spear-guns, hypodermic needles, or mechanical eels.  The dialogue - whether uttered by white-trash or first-class performers such as Louis Gossett Jr. or Bess Armstrong - is always painful and most of the actors deserve better.  The film does however, pull out all the stops for an impossible finale that is not only the most competent scene in the film but also, dare I say, inspired.  Jaws 3-D is pure kitsch, a howlingly bad 98 minutes of absurd action sequences, shoddy special-effects and tawdry scenery.  If the preceding sentence exemplifies all that you enjoy about trash cinema, then by all means see Jaws 3-D!

The scene where the shark is lured into the filtration pipe and crunches Simon MacCorkindale is still fun to watch if only for the lovely sound effects.The strong cast is seriously let down by a script that goes far too far beyond the realms of suspension of disbelief.  A 25-foot Great White in the first film is conceivable, but a slow-moving 35-footer takes all the scariness away from being a Great White.  Also, a death count of 3 (4 including the pre-credits fish) is a bit disappointing for 'New depths of terror'.The 3-D effects inevitably look rubbish on the small screen and the stop motion miniatures are shocking (The final explosion is still satisfying despite the slightly naff re-formation of the jaws).  It was nice of the shark creators to try and get the protruding jaws effect of a real great white but it just doesn't work and simply looks like they forgot to attach the teeth to the shark.As far as the series goes, the film's a real disappointment but it's not frustratingly unwatchable.

Jaws 3D worked in the cinema, and that's what they made it for. If you're a Jaws fan like me, you'll have to get it. At least you can imagine how good it was in the 3D cinemas.

Later, the new JAWS movie was put out only to convince folks that it wasn't the same thing again. The result probably was beyond disappointment.Here's what I believe happened to JAWS 3. Alan Landsburg Productions actually created a killer shark movie not relating to the JAWS theme. Universal had a past history of suing film studios in releasing rip-offs similar to their patented work. Letting the giant movie studio release ALP's production was obviously the safest bet in avoiding a lawsuit.

Bess Armstrong was pretty good too, otherwise the remaining supporting cast was bland.The plot was fair but the whole branding of SeaWorld kind of left a bad taste in my mouth. Considering SeaWorld is a corporation that at the time in the 1980's had a very likely chance of treating animals poorly. Just like in Part 2 with the sailing scenes, there was a lot of fluff scenes that was basically performances by the SeaWorld staff.

The plot is exactly the same, only it takes place at Sea World, so we'll skip it. Not one of the cast members from the first two films showed up, but this was scripted by Carl Gottlieb, (original Jaws Screenwriter) ,and, for some peculiar reason, Richard Matheson. Dennis Quaid plays Michael Brody, the kid from the other movies (people age faster in sequel-land, I guess), and he is no substitute for Roy Scheider. Really, he's dweeby, unimposing, and an all around nice guy. The coolest stunt he does in the film is crash a golf cart. None of the other characters really left much of an impression on me either.The mechanical shark is as bad as in the first two films, but this time the film makers were dumb enough to show it all the time, showing just how fakey it is. At one point, it even crashes through the control room at Sea World, kind of like the Airplane in 1980's Airplane, only even funnier.

Deep Blue Sea of course focuses on several ocean stowaways on a research lagoon where three captured sharks eventually go awry and end up as man-eating killers almost in the style of all of the Jaws movies. Jaws III is almost like that.It was of course the original Jaws where those who loved Jaws had seen how the movie ended....with a shark being blown up as a bullet pierces a compressed-air scuba canister thanks to Chief Brody's hail of bullets from a rifle from an Orca boat that was about to be completely sunk into nothing.Jaws III has a slight give-away in the middle of the movie where a visiting character with a UK accent shows how a rogue shark could be killed....by a nose bomb. Definitely this refers to how the original Jaws ended...with an explosion. I found out that this explosive device has a power nearly similar to an explosive force as a classic depth charge. Louis Gossett Jr. tells that guy never to attempt to set off such explosives in the lagoon that was going to be terrorized by a baby rogue shark (a 13-footer) which dies in captivity in the lagoon, hence infuriating the rogue shark's mother that enters the lagoon through a faulty gate; this shark, a 28- to 32-footer (definitely a Great White class), chases the path where the already-dead shark went inside the lagoon and terrorizes the lagoon for another meal and some more victims.Louis Gossett Jr. counters that these shark-killing explosives could destroy the acrylic material in the lagoon and destroy the lagoon itself. But of course, when the shark hits the windows of the main control room of the lagoon, flooding it, using the nose bomb was a last resort because before the last shark was bloodied to death by the explosion, it already ate up one of the main control employees of the lagoon.I had seen that one of the other actors was a marine biologist who had tried to care for the shark that was killed in captivity.

In its man-made lagoon, about 40 feet under the water, Sea World opens the Undersea Kingdom, a new set of underwater glass tunnels that have their own control room, and Calvin's friend Philip FitzRoyce is there to do some filming.

When Overman's body is found, Michael vomits when he sees it. Kathryn looks at the body and knows that the baby shark could not have been the shark that killed Overman, because the baby shark's bite radius is too small its 35-foot-long mother killed Overman. When Kathryn and Michael tell Calvin and Philip about the shark, they all try to evacuate the park, including the park's beach, as they try their best to protect Sea World's visitors from the shark.The series is starting to get a little silly now.

(This is an extended version of the review I wrote on February 2007)JAWS goes from classic to just plain camp. JAWS 3-D is actually entertaining for more than just its campiness, but that's just generally why its mildly entertaining. Although this dreary series slowly hitting the dump, this one is actually quite a guilty pleasure. I've heard some pretty bad reviews about this sequel. That's simply too bad, I quite enjoyed this one, depending on how you view it. It has a real twist from the first two. This shark doesn't terrorize Amity like the first two. This one takes place in Sea World (not the one in Florida which we know and love). The shark is bigger than the usual and is wrecking havoc on a grand opening ceremony when her infant, who was captured and kept in the park, died recently. Now throw in some ridiculous scare tactics and it's an amusing film, granted not a great one, but certainly deserves even a little bit of merit. By the looks of it, it hardly bears resemblance to its predecessors, except that it features Mike Brody, played by Dennis Quaid. The film co-stars Louis Gossett Jr. giving an over-the-top performance, but as far as I can see he is the only good performer. The special-effects are terrible (not good then, just plain laughable now) but there are some really good moments and the ending with the shark is superb (even if the effects are amateurish even for 80's standards).Not as bad as they say, if only for its camp value. Watch out for that fake shark crashing through the glass! Rating ** out of 5.

Yeah, like these actors would be missed.The story revolves around a couple of Brodys hanging out at Sea World (why do all these people keep getting jobs near water?). One day, the staff catches a shark and things begin to take a turn for the worse. The boss actually decides to just show this great white to everyone in some kind of pool surrounded with an ankle-high wall. I see nothing wrong with that apart from the fact that the shark still doesn't manage to kill anyone.

A bunch of people fall into the water right in front of him, they all make it. Unbelievable.Okay, I can't really be fair about this movie because I never watched the movie in 3D. But then again, I don't think it would have made much of a difference. Of course, seeing parts of sharks flying in your face is amusing but it gets old really fast.

The new man-made lagoon with its maze of underwater tunnels called the Undersea Kingdom is shortly to open, but before doing so a great white shark is caught in the lagoon and with some convincing; owner Calvin Bouchard sees it as an opportunity to generate some business for the park. So on the opening day a dead body of a missing worker is found, but Kathryn realises that it wasn't their great white which killed the man. It was it's mother who is approximately 35-foot long and is living unknowingly in the lagoon.Wow, what crap! Yeah it's bad, but despite the negative flack that this film always seems to cop; at least it's watchable trite. For me this is one big guilty pleasure and it's actually my favourite 'Jaws' sequel&#133; oh my! I think it was the last one I saw in the series (and Jaws the Revenge being the first&#133; ugh!) Well, the sequels are simply stinkers with the franchise turning into somewhat of a joke (thankyou Jaws The Revenge). But I thoroughly enjoyed this scratchy and quite corny flick. Actually, the concept for the film isn't too bad, but it's just the execution where it goes awry and the script is a bit of a groaner too. Well really, the rotten to the core special effects is what sticks out like a sore thumb, though it made it even more amusing in it's ineptness. That's because originally the film was released in 3D, but since the images are in 2D is looks quite bad and flat. Who knows the gimmick might have blown me away&#133; eh, probably not, but I still think that I would get a good laugh out of it. Well it would add more to the factor since the film is simply an unintentional comedy&#133; yeah comedy, because there isn't too much in the way of thrills. It was just too goofy to be effective with only one or two suspenseful spurts that will raise a sweat, but more so it's plain cringe-worthy and simply implausible.The useless screenplay is pretty thin and dramatically flat across the board, but I give them points for a change of scenery. The film's setting is perfect and it's a real change of pace. I don't know if you can actually call it Jaws' show, since it basically took every opportunity to promote Florida's Sea World, even if there was a shark on the loose eating guests. But it centres more about the park and disaster this whole mayhem plays on it, which in doing so makes us want more bang for our buck. The hysteria and shark attack scenes are reasonably quick flashes and just lacking the killer blow. But I didn't find it too much of a problem.But good gawd the shark looked terrifyingly&#133; horrid! Seeing a shark close up would be petrifying, but here that's not the case because this rubber, robotic clap-trap was totally unconvincing and incredibly overdone. We just see too much of it and I never knew sharks growl. Oh well, if you can't scare the audience at least you got to amaze them in some shape. It also surprisingly builds up an atmosphere when the uninvited guests go munching and the underwater scenes are done quite well. The time goes by quick enough even with some irreverent padding. But for some people I can see why think its dull and that's because of the lack of horrific terror. The slow-motion sequences were horrifying, though! The music score is simply unspectacular with the trivial main theme making the only progress. The acting seems to be torn to shreds by people, but I thought Dennis Quaid, Bess Armstrong, Louis Gossett Jr. and Simon MacCorkindale gave modest performances with weak characters.An entertaining B-flick that's not that particularly exciting, but it tried to be different and I still I don't think its that dire as a lot people make it out to be. I don't know if it would make the film any better being in 3D, but the novelty of it would have been interesting.

In theatres it was presented in glorious 3-D, but not for home video, nor is it shown in its original 2.351 aspect ratio, which sort of takes the fun out of this movie. But it still has its assets. Besides having a big cast, I can easily say that the mechanical shark in this installment is the best yet! First off, I liked how the eyes of this shark realistically rolled back white whenever it attacked its prey, just as real sharks' do. A very nice touch.I also noticed that the shark in this movie had a lot more attention paid to the working mechanics of its jaws. For instance, when a shark opens its mouth, its gums lower to the point that they look like they're going to fall right out of its mouth. You'd think something so noticeable would've been incorperated into the design of the mechanical shark in the the first Jaws movie. But it wasn't until Jaws 3 when that effect finally came into play. It was the first and only mechanical shark in the series that did that. It was also the only shark in the series that never stuck its head out of the water for more than a couple of seconds, which was more realistic than having a shark throw itself onto a boat, and stay there until someone slides into its mouth.Lastly, the shark's skin seems to have been perfected. It wasn't rubbery like the sharks in the first and second movie, and wasn't as rough as sandpaper like the one in the fourth Jaws. Its skin actually looked fleshy! Apart from the shark's super-slow speed, and the several instinces where we were obviously meant to see it in 3-D, this shark looked more real than all the other sharks in the series put together! The one thing that I couldn't get past with the shark in this movie was its size. Though it's true that all the sharks in the Jaws series were guilty of being overly large, 35 feet is ridiculous! And what better way to see this big female shark demonstrate her freakish size than by scooping a full grown man completely into her mouth, where he's repeatedly squeezed between her massive tongue and the roof of her mouth until he explodes! Though it was interesting to watch, and maybe even a little funny, it was clearly impossible.All in all, this movie just served to be campy fun, and will appeal to you if you enjoy movies like Anaconda, Lake Placid, Piranha, and Deep Blue Sea. However, if you're hoping for a movie that recaptures the fear of the original Jaws, than don't look any further than Jaws 2..........

But the fact of the matter remains, I have been a big fan of sharks since I was about three years old, and what this film does is retain the shark physics very well. Shark behavior, on the other hand, is completely reversed (great whites only tend to go in for hit-and-run attacks) but that's really not the point of this film.What this movie is made for is purely entertainment. While the first Jaws had a tremendous amount of psychological tension, this film provides only death, death, death. More people are killed in this film than any other Jaws film. Not to mention that they made the shark the largest it could possibly be (35 ft). The 35 foot great white is as rare as fist-sized diamonds, but we see one in this film--thank God, though, for the size of the shark does save the film ever so slightly.The first hour of the film consists of tension regarding a smaller, ten foot long baby shark that is kept in captivity, being the only great white in such a state. Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong provide the leading roles here, and they are both incredibly good actors that have been given an incredibly mundane script. However, as a shark fan, I recommend this film for its scientific accuracy in the first half.Once the information is relayed to Louis Gosset Jr.'s character, Calvin, the story begins to turn sour. At first, the shark appears among a group of black-tips and sand tigers (less dangerous and smaller aquarium-type sharks) outside of SeaWorld's more expensive dining area, and it really scares the living hell out of the tourists (imagine a 35-foot black-eyed monster suddenly appearing around sharks no larger than perhaps six feet right in front of you).From there on, the whole movie turns to trash. It's like Godzilla underwater. The shark looks claymated (seriously) and it's vile and malicious. Sharks really aren't that smart. I don't believe any shark would ever smash its way into an undersea control room, but this one does. Also, I recall reading that sharks need to keep moving through the sea to survive (other than the sleeper shark), but this one has no trouble camping out for ten minutes to claim several victims. Also, I realize that this shark needs quite a bit of food to sustain itself (hello, 35 friggin' FEET!!!) but the fact is, it eats a few people, and yet the first of the people it eats in the second half of the film is not even swallowed, even after another victim is (see the film, you will understand what I mean by this).The best part of this film is the part in which a diver is trapped inside the mouth of the beast. For about three minutes we watch as this diver is chewed up (and really empathetically feel his tension). The camera angles for this time frame all appear inside the monster's mouth and the whole experience is coupled with a sense of intense claustrophobia that cannot be replicated in any other film.This movie was overall a hunk of garbage, but to fans of sharks like myself, a few shots of vodka can make Jaws III very interesting, but further than that, I would call it utter crap.

Exactly what part of his novel inspired this low rent monster flick? Anyway, despite being written by the original screenwriters of the first two films, Carl Gottlieb and Howard Sackler, this has nothing to do with Jaws I or II. It is largely a mediocre throwback to 1950s monster movies, even released originally in 3D, which only makes it seem even more like a 1950s B-movie. One gets the feeling, however, that even in cinemas, in 3D, the effects were largely unnoticeable; I forgot that it was originally filmed in 3D, except for when Jaws' jaws come flying at the screen during the climax, and two or three times dolphins are shown jumping out of the water toward the camera, in an incredibly cheesy, 1970s greeting card type of montage. Shark and mommy shark on the loose at Sea World(!) and a cast of soon- to-be-famous people have to do battle with them, blandly and boringly. Lea Thompson is cute in this, her first film role, but apparently the filmmakers didn't think much of her, because after receiving a bad cut on her leg at the climax, her character is never mentioned again. Simon MacCorkindale was clearly unfamiliar with his lines of dialogue, as he obviously stutters and stammers his way through them several times. The plot is only mediocre, in a campy, so-bad-it's-good way; the same can be said about the effects. The climax is a low rent rip off of the first film's ending instead of large yellow barrels, and a canister of compressed air exploding to kill the shark, this time we get tiny yellow grenades to explode and kill the shark, and wake up the dozing audience members. Truthfully though, this isn't quite as awful as its reputation has it. I probably prefer this film to Jaws II, slightly.

A better movie probably could have been made utilizing the basic premise, but these filmmakers aren't up to that challenge. The dialogue and the characters are just not that interesting, and the movie doesn't start to cook until past the hour mark. It may be unique for this franchise in its attempt to cash in on the resurgence in 3-D cinema during this time, but the effects are pretty damn laughable most of the time. Debuting first unit director Joe Alves, the production designer and second unit director on the first two movies, proves to be out of his depth here, and thereafter returned to what he did best.Police Chief Brody's eldest son Mike, now played by Dennis Quaid, is currently working at Florida's Sea World where he's romancing head biologist Kathryn Morgan (Bess Armstrong). As he is visited by his baby brother Sean (John Putch), an enormous shark slips inside the park gates, nibbling on an occasional victim before eventually making her presence known to the public.Co-written by Carl Gottlieb, who also co-wrote the first two movies, and none other than Richard Matheson (based on a story idea by Guerdon Trueblood), although Matheson would later charge that script doctors ruined his original premise. The actors are all reasonably likable, with a lovely and adorable Lea Thompson making her feature film debut and Louis Gossett Jr. offering a very amusing take on the entrepreneur character Calvin Bouchard. Simon MacCorkindale is likewise a hoot as the somewhat smarmy documentarian. John Williams's iconic score is appropriately utilized once again, with new compositions courtesy of Alan Parker.If there is one nice touch here, it's the added threat of Sea World customers trapped in underwater tunnels that have been weakened by the sharks' rampages.This kills time agreeably enough, if the viewer isn't too demanding.Five out of 10.

If I could rate it 0 stars then I would. How they can actually call this movie 'Jaws', not 'The Haunted Surfboard', I don't know. Poor, poor, Spielberg.I didn't believe one bit that there was a shark in the waters, even though I did in Jaws 1 and 2. Firstly, the special effects were so out of date. In the dolphin scene, where they first saw the shark, when you see the Great White for the first time, I found that they just stole the footage from an old National Geographic Documentary. Secondly, this movie was full of sexual references. For example, Sean Brody says to his older brother Michael Brody, I was so close to doing it in the water last night. after doing something inappropriate at the beach the previous night. Finally, the amount of shark facts they got wrong was just tremendous. I completely lost count. Overall, if you want to watch all of the 'Jaws' movies, I advise you skip this to 'Jaws The Revenge' for nothing important happens in this movie. So, under no circumstances (except for a good laugh) watch this movie EVER. Or else you'll find yourself being sick.

Whereas the first two films were set in a New England sea resort and focused on the struggle of an everyman police chief against a force of nature, this entry gives us an amusement park, a dolphin trainer, and her dolphins.The change is most apparent when one listens to the soundtrack. Whereas John Williams's soundtrack was full of menace, the Jaws 3-D soundtrack is full of celebratory cues meant to show off Sea World. (Indeed, at times the film comes across as an advertisement for Sea World.) Even the shark cues come across as adventurous rather than suspenseful. Although it's a good score, it doesn't really fit a horror movie.The horror is further diminished by the lack of characters to care about. The performances are too broad to care about any of the main characters, particularly Louis Gossett Jr. doing Murray Hamilton-lite as the owner of Sea World. Moreover, most of the shark attack victims are depicted as unlikeable, eliminating any real sense of empathy.The only reason I gave this film four rather than three stars is that I loved it as a child. It's mainly good for nostalgia or showing younger children to introduce them to the Jaws series.

At this writing, it ranks number 49, but is probably worst than that.  Believe me, even the 3D effects such as they were didn't help this turkey and it's amazing that the career of any of the actors involved survived it. Well, some of their careers didn't, as Bess Armstrong and Simon MacCorkindale went on to do bad television series and/or miniseries.  Though you may never have a chance to experience the film in 3D take my word for it when I tell you that you didn't miss anything.  The 3D effects were minimal, for example, in most scenes the shark was too big for the 3d effect to work, and other than some splashing water, and one floating fish head, there wasn't any sense in even bothering with filming it in 3D.  On top of this, never has the audio in a film been as bad as this one.  There are times when you have to strain to hear any of the dialogue.  Then again, you probably wouldn't want to hear it so you're better off.   I suppose I could talk about the acting, but there isn't any.  The worst offender here is Louis Gossett Jr. who should have known better.  He spends most of the film shouting mumbled dialogue which is totally unintelligible, as if he were in a hurry to get his part over with so he could leave the studio lot as quickly as possible without being seen.  He must have had some foresight into the big stinkeroo this legendary dead fish tale would become.The film must have made some money though.  That's why we were next subjected to Jaws IV, which goes onto prove that Carp is Carp, no matter what number you put behind it.  As for any excitement and suspense, my advice is for you to open a can of Star Kist.  That would be more thrilling than this mess, and take up a whole lot less of your time.

Lingering shots of coral, pointy objects and fish heads fill the screen and show 3D for what it truly is. Rubbish. The worst idea that the film employs is making the shark 3D too, turning it from a lean mean killing machine into a floating, etheral blue turd.

There was Jaws 3 and Jaws 4 The Revenge, and that was it pretty much! But then, as per the late nineties approximately, we literally received an overflow of inferior and quite often downright retarded killer shark flicks. And now all of a sudden, the aforementioned Jaws sequels actually don't look too terrible anymore. It started in the late 90's with the still traditional but totally inept Deep Blue Sea and Shark Attack, but then since the new Millennium things really got out of control with murderous sharks popping up in the most illogical of places (like the rivers in Venice, in Tsunami infested areas, swamps, etc&#x85;) and &#x96; worse even &#x96; all kinds of ridiculous hybrids and genetically altered species, like dinosaur sharks, octopus-sharks and two-headed sharks. Sigh &#x85; whatever happened to good-old fashioned massively over-sized Great Whites, like in our classic early 80's stinker Jaws 3-D? Now, please don't misunderstand me, the third installment in the Jaws franchise is still a very lousy film, but at least it's not bad in a frustrating or annoying way. The underdeveloped screenplay, the laughable attempt to bring depth to the main characters, the hilarious 3D effects and all the totally irrelevant padding footage &#x85; It almost feels cheesy and charming in a positive sort of way now. Interesting detail here is that Universal Studios, the mastodon production company behind the Jaws franchise, sued the creators of an obscure Italian imitation for being too reminiscent, but then they were hypocrite enough to steal ideas from the movie they accused of stealing from them! That's Hollywood for you, I guess. The script attempts, poorly I may add, to build a bridge between the previous two movies by depicting the Brody boys (the sons of Roy Scheider) as pivot characters in the grand opening of a brand new Florida Ocean theme park. Mike, the oldest one, works there as the head engineer and his younger brother Sean &#x96; supposedly still suffering from his childhood trauma even though he blindly follows the first cute girl he meets straight in the water for a nightly swimming session &#x96; comes to visit him for the ceremony. Due to malfunctioning underwater fences and unreliable technical staff, the park quickly receives unforeseen visitors in the shape of a great white shark and its offspring. Also in good old Jaws tradition, the park's senior executive initially hopes to exploit the baby shark as a unique special attraction without realizing he puts the lives of hundreds of guests and personnel in danger. When Junior White dies in front of many spectators, mommy goes on a relentless killing and destruction spree. The body count is intolerably low for a shark movie, but that's probably because all the action is concentrated in the last twenty minutes of the film. Throughout more than an hour, we're only exposed to uninteresting relationship issues, dull family conversations and a whole lot of random waterskiing footage. Most of the supportive characters are embarrassing stereotypes (an Australian outback hunter?) and the effects are hysterical even by early 80's standards. Especially the shark's ultimate attack is legendary, as he approaches the underwater control room in slow motion while the people inside just pull stupid faces.

The film focuses on Sea World in Florida where a Great White of some sort has snuck into the giant lagoon that they have at the park. So working at the park are Mike Brody (Quaid), son of the chief of course from part one and Katharine Morgan (Armstrong) chief biologist and girlfriend of his. Both do things with dolphins and eventually his brother Sean comes down as well. Well things start to go down hill as some beefy guy (grant) is missing, some divers among others and they find out there is a great white in the lagoon. So the owner Calvin Bouchard (Gossett Jr.) hires his pal Fitzroy (Mackcorkindale), some playboy esc adventure type to kill the shark and on live TV! Yea I bet that would fly. After some talking with Morgan he realizes they would make more cash if they could capture it (obviously). They manage to capture it and put it on display, but of course as in real life sharks, especially whites don't do to well in captivity and it dies. Funny how they gave the shark a pen that could barley hold small fish let alone a ten foot white. But meanwhile in one of the tunnels people can view from underwater a body has been found floating. It's the beef cake. What's left of him and Katherine determines that it must have been done by a far larger shark...lets say the mother, about 35 feet long. Soon the mom starts killing, reeking havoc, breaking the tunnels and stuff. Fitzroy and his pal go down to trap it, while Mike fixes something under water. Fitzroy gets swallowed and then it goes after mike. In a very stupid scene the shark smashes through the underwater glass, but is killed by the grenade still attached to what's left of Fitzroy's arm in the shark's mouth and it blows up...wow right out of the screen! Bad movie, but at least the dolphins live.OK anyone that knows anything about the series knows this is a bad film. Just about everything about it is bad. Everything! Even the setting isn't that great. I'm surprised that sea world would want publicity from this film about a killer shark, maybe that's why it didn't kill that many people. The acting is terrible, even from Jr. who I like. What the hell script did they give the man that you can barley understand what he is saying? There were more than a few parts where the sound is off and the mouths don't match. And it's not just Jr., its all badly acted to the point where you don't care what happens to any of the people. The first 2 movies I actually felt bad for most of the people, but from hence forth....no. You will beg for the shark to kill them. The setting may have been the only redeemable part in this film as in Revenge. But still the shark barley even kills anyone in this and it's been highly toned down to where the shark is now slow and very inefficient. The shark itself is huge, but very fake, not as bad as Revenge but very close. For the young shark they use almost all shots of a real great white sped up on film which looked very poor. And most of the film the creature is apparently stuck in some vent shaft and manages to swim backwards&#133;OK did anyone read a book on sharks? And of course the 3-D aspect. It dose look very bad, but why is it that Friday the 13th part 3 it didn't look nearly as bad as the shots they made here? The dumbest being Jaws coming at the glass underwater at the end. Seriously if you haven't seen this it was a one peace prop just coming straight at the camera and didn't even move it was so bad. Then it blows up and peaces of the jaw come at the viewer. Now granted it probably looked cool on screen with the glasses so I'm going easy, but even at that, they made it look so fake. And there are plenty of total goofs, like when Jaws is behind the water skiers, being a 35ft shark with its dorsal fin so close the mouth would have been under the skiers already. One part that stood out was when they get the corpse of the guy it really looked nasty and stripped away. However since it had been there for a number of days all the fish would have stripped it, so even that was silly. Overall I think this is slightly better then Revenge, but just barley. It may come down just to which one you prefer rather then the specifics. Let's say 2 and half out of ten stars, don't forget to look out for McFly's mom.

Well, it was worse than I ever could have anticipated and it was funny, but not even funny enough to keep me watching til the end.Why this was ever made into a film is beyond me. It should have been abandoned when it was a mere concept. Alas, time and money were put into making it and now poor suckers like me will waste their time and money on watching it. The story-line is moronic at the best of times. It seems strange to me that a supposedly brand-new, technologically advanced water-park would have such weak, rusty fences, prone to breaking and letting in Great White Sharks of monstrous proportions. And why are the Brody kids involved? It's implausible to the extreme to suggest that a third shark would follow members of one family all around in order to seek revenge for dead sharks it is unlikely to have come across. Considering the poor story, I'm surprised the shark didn't follow the family into the middle of the desert. And Florida? Really, Greak White's prefer cooler waters!And when the Shark gets stuck in the vents to the underwater lagoon, how does it survive in knee-deep water with the oxygen cut off for about 10 minutes? Even surviving long enough to kill a man (who also had his vital supply of oxygen cut off for 10 minutes) and manage to smash through the metal? I wonder.The shark attack scenes, well they were terrible. In an attempt to look more realistic they've gone with doco-style shots of a real shark (much smaller than the one supposedly in the park) sped up so that the shark's natural movements make it look more like it's having a seizure than attacking. And to be honest, I couldn't see half of what was going on anyway because of how dark it all was. Some parts of the movie were spent with me watching a black screen and trying to piece together what was going on through the poor dialogue. Needless to say, I could hardly keep up and I'm not sure whether that was due to the constantly changing story-line or the fact that I couldn't see anything. I could go on and on about how crap this movie was and how much I don't recommend it, (even as a bit of a laugh) but frankly, I think I've wasted enough time on this movie.

Unfortunately, the shark's mommy comes looking for it and wreaks all kinds of havoc in the process. Now it's up to Michael to stop the shark. With astoundingly bad special effects and acting, Jaws 3 makes the second film look like Ben Hur.Even what remains of John Williams' score couldn't make this movie the least bit chilling. The makers of this film decided to switch it up from the first one and show the shark any chance they get. Unfortunately, the special effects are so bad in this movie that the shark looks like a cartoon among reality. The tail doesn't even move as it swims through the water. They even make the shark roar like a lion, even though that's impossible. The plot of this movie is too simple. Mommy shark looks for baby shark. Kills people. Michael Brody must stop it. Anything beyond that is useless filler. The second film was understandable because it took place in the same area where it would be more likely to see another shark. Now we're at Sea World where Michael Brody works, and another killer shark shows up! Michael's gotta think there's a curse on him. When he was 12, the first shark swam right by him after killing somebody. When he was 16, he was attacked on a sailboat by another shark.

It absolutely blows my mind to fathom that the classic science fiction author Richard Matheson was somehow involved in co-writing this exercise in extreme tedium. The so-called story is a failed attempt at changing the locale to an aquatic theme park called Sea World where Chief Brody's now-grown son Michael works. Rather conveniently, two sharks (mother and child?) manage to gain access to the underwater kingdom to wreak havoc.Sounds like it has potential? Forget it. The new shark scenes are sillier than ever, the level of tension and suspense is nil, and the characters are completely uninteresting. The worst served here is actor Lou Gossett Jr., who was so excellent in the previous year's AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN. What a waste. Dennis Quaid plays Mike without much to do, and while his love interest Bess Armstrong is cute in a girl-next-door sort of way, she leaves no impression either. The selling point of the film in 1983 was its 3-D effects, and these look absolutely pathetic on your 2-D home screen.A really, really bad and muddled movie and easily one of the very worst sequels to a classic motion picture ever made.

Unbelievably, unforgivably bad in nearly every way, the film wastes a really good premise (the eponymous killer shark loose in a Florida water park) through poor scripting, atrocious special effects and forgettable characters.The action has moved from Amity island to Florida's water park where the sons of Police Chief Brody (the Roy Scheider character from the first two, who does not appear here) are working away quietly.  Mike (Dennis Quaid) is a diver and engineer and kid brother Mike (John Putch) is tagging along, whilst going out with a local water-skiier (a pre-Back to the Future Lea Thompson).  The new underwater theme park is preparing to open and proprietor Calvin Bouchard (Louis Gossett Jr) is keen to up the publicity for maximum profit.  Lo and behold, a Great White and it's baby spawn appear, to cause the predictable havoc......The scripting for this is quite dire.  There is too much in the way of technical detail (explaining the how the whole park works, filtration pipes, explosives and what not) therefore the whole story becomes lost and merely a means to serve the audience with shark attacks.The acting for this film is largely forgettable.  Dennis Quaid, Lea Thompson, John Putch and Louis Gossett Jr (excellent in An Officer and a Gentleman) turn in unmemorable performances.  There is no depth, no humour and thus absolutely no sympathy with any of the characters.Much was made of the fact this film was shot in 3-D, so we're treated to a series of totally pointless shots, including the lingering, gory aftermath of several shark attacks and a shot of the shark closing in for the kill, getting no bigger as it moves closer...The shark announces itself right from the start, homing in on a bunch of water-skiers practising outside the lagoon.  Later appearances are oomphed up slightly through a couple of jump-scares, and when the mother shark eventually goes on the rampage, the initial sight of its massive tail thumping on the underwater plexiglass is quite intimidating. The film could have made more use of live action shark shots and John Williams music, as the shark model itself, when eventually revealed, is nothing more than a clunky, toothless lump of grey-brown plastic.  It's final scenes with a sight of a victim being devoured from inside the shark, and the shark dying from an explosion set off from another character trapped in it's maw, are almost laughably bad.Clearly the lamest of the Jaws series, it was followed by Jaws The Revenge which improved on this effort while bringing an effective sense of closure to the by-now worn-out franchise.

That's probably why they picked Joe Alves, the production designer from the first Jaws movie as well as others (Escape From New York, for example, another very grimy-dark and somewhat shoddy looking movie) to direct--the guy was obviously better with everything other than the human portions of the scenery. Or maybe not. The whole movie looks very flat and colorless...lifeless. It's strange.No, I think what really kills this movie for me is that seems very...I don't know...UNPLEASANT. There are ways to take even the most misanthropic horror, the silliest and most glaringly fake special effects, and make it compelling, interesting, and somehow cool to watch. It's a very subtle thing which I can't put my finger on. Jaws 3 doesn't come close. As ridiculous as the movie is, it tries to be relentlessly dark, and there are hints of a kind of nastiness or something which doesn't scare me, or even horrify me, but just make me feel very uncomfortable instead, like I need to take a shower afterwards. Perhaps it tries to be too literal when it begs to be stylized. Perhaps it's too dead serious when it's obviously claptrap. There some kind of jarring collision going on, something isn't working right. Basically the thing is the visual equivalent of indigestion.I will admit that certain things like sound effects work almost too well--the crunching as another vapid Floridian becomes fish food, the muffled underwater groans and shouts. But it's not horrifying in a good, entertaining way, you know? There is one very inventive shot, I also have to admit--the one prick cameraman diver gets eaten, and you watch the poor bastard getting chewed from INSIDE the shark's gullet.I think I may have an answer. It seems like unlike many horror movies, which simply like to show off gore effects and photogenic ways to kill people, Jaws 3 seems to revel specifically in helpless suffering, prolonging people's pain while they die. Even that poor fish at the beginning doesn't just get eaten...the severed head floats there half-alive for half a minute, uselessly working its mouth, just to drive the point home. It's a distinctly sadistic movie. Perhaps we need to coin a new movie genre for films like this loathing movies. As such Jaws 3 would probably rank up there with The Passion Of The Christ or something as one of the all-time greats.

The requisite underwater terrain alone is a perfect medium for textured dimensional rendering, and the idea of a terrifying, relentless killing machine swimming off-screen into audiences' laps is inherently awesome in and of itself. Sadly, this uneven offering never takes full advantage of its technology or its subject matter, and while it's nowhere near as bad as the truly abysmal Jaws The Revenge (few things are), it's also nowhere near as good as the flawless original or the excellent and unfairly dismissed follow-up.Even without its potentially interesting visual ploy, Jaws 3-D has all of the ingredients to be a great sequel on paper a stellar cast, a fresh concept, and, of course, a toothy behemoth that had already generated some of the scariest moments in screen history. These assets are ultimately squandered however. The seasoned ensemble is given very little to do, so the character studies at the heart of Jaws and Jaws 2 are bypassed entirely. The Sea World setting is woefully underused, and instead of giving our beast a novel killing ground, the park mostly functions as merely another mass of water for the action to unfold in. Worse, the shark itself isn't ever used in a suspenseful fashion, and the handful of deaths attributed to the monster are blatantly telegraphed and largely ineffective.Like many 3-D films that are stripped of their visual device for the home market, this one contains multiple scenes that may have been fun to behold on theater screens, but become utterly silly here. Floating fish heads and severed limbs bobbing with the tide might have provided cheap thrills for the opening weekend audience, but in a flat DVD representation, they simply function as camera shots that linger for far too long.The shark effects range from serviceable to downright awful, and since footage of actual sharks is utilized rather extensively, the titular titan more clearly resembles a synthetic puppet when we're seeing it at work. A couple of scenes of the creature slamming into gates and boats seem to have been created by using a plastic mock-up instead the sophisticated robotic construct that populated the first two Jaws outings, and since little effort is made to sell these moments, you can actually see the rubber shark bounce off its targets upon collision. When these flashes are integrated alongside the graceful maneuvering of real great whites, there is little symmetry between the two versions and the complete suspension of disbelief required to make a scenario like this pay off is rarely achieved.Apart from its obviousness as a prop, the shark in Jaws 3-D just isn't all that frightening because the meager body count doesn't allow it to prove itself as an insatiable murder machine. A couple of random victims are thrown in early on, but when the shark finally makes its way into the water park, where a virtual smÃ¶rgÃ¥sbord of flailing legs awaits, every single person the shark pursues easily escapes its titular Jaws. Only one of the major characters gets bit during this extended sequence, and she gets away with little more than a few scratches on her leg.There are a few solid jump scares peppered throughout the film, but while the tension seems to be mounting every step of the way, the movie invariably pulls back before anything all that spectacular or horrifying occurs. Even the promising climax goes flaccid when the absolute dumbest false 3-D moment occurs, and any menace our finned antagonist has generated along the way is readily diffused by a protracted shot of her slowly floating toward the camera and breaking through a plainly animated sheet of glass. The way the shark is dispatched is particularly hard to swallow (this is actually a pretty good pun if you've seen the film), and yet another silly extended in your face moment caps off a tremendously underwhelming resolution.Savvy collectors will easily be able to track down readily available bootleg DVDs that retain the original 3-D presentation, but even the cleanest transfer available on the secondary market is still high-generation and extremely murky, a state which naturally strips away the potency of the visual effects. Watching my copy gave me a headache, and I had to stop about every thirty minutes or so to take off the glasses and give my eyes a rest. I eventually made it through, but when I did, all I discovered was that Jaws 3-D isn't much more impressive in its original form. The obsessive collector in me knows that if this offering ever gets a proper Blu-Ray release I will have to add it to my collection and give the film at least one more go, but the realist in me is guessing that even digitized 3-D effects won't make up for the numerous other weaknesses on hand here.There are a few effective moments here that will hold the attention of admirers of the series, but the film as a whole is a missed opportunity that can only be rightfully recommended to the most forgiving killer fish fans. An even better recommendation for those who have digested every frame of the unmatchable original and simply must have more is to skip this one entirely and give Jaws 2 another look instead.

How long they have had this reputation for, I do not know. If they did not have such a reputation before 1983, they certainly earned it then. After Friday The 13th Part 3, all the 3D film needed was another crapfest to give it a reputation as being a cover for a bad story or script. They got it in the form of Jaws 3-D, which not only ranks as one of the worst films I have seen to date, it also ranks as one of the worst 3D films I can remember. And I include 3D shorts from theme parks in that list.As with all films that have 3D photography, the big make-or-break point is the 3D effects. Where Friday The 13th Part 3 did at least a reasonable job with this effect, Jaws 3-D is a spectacular crapfest with its effects, too. Given that both films were shot using the same process, ArriVision 3D, the blame for this lies solely with the director. Underwater shots are hideous in appearance, with enough grain and diminished focus to leave the audience wondering what in the blazes is going on. A lack of detail in dark spots of the picture is often characteristic of films that were shot in the early 1980s and previous, but many of the underwater shots show no effort at all to alleviate this problem. Those who have seen Blade Runner will know this is not impossible. In fact, a few stage lights in the right places could have worked miracles during the underwater/nighttime shots.The acting is thoroughly wooden, but I cannot help blaming the director for this, too. Given that the cast includes such B-list dependables as Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett Jr., one would at least expect to be able to coax a halfway decent performance out of them. Especially considering that the things they are reacting to existed right on the set with them. Sadly, Quaid looks like he is ready to ask if he is meant to be scared yet, and Gossett Jr. looks like he's ingested too many painkillers. Mind you, these are the best performances that the film has to offer. You will be hard pressed to name two other actors from the film or the characters they portrayed.To the film's credit, there are no ridiculous scenes where the shark roars or explodes for no readily apparent reason. While the photography does much to make the equivalent scenes in Jaws 3-D nonsensical, they do make sense if you pay attention. Unfortunately, the ridiculous 3D effects will also leave you chuckling. The moment when the shark explodes, and its teeth come flying at the screen, is a priceless moment of unintentional comedy.This is where it all comes crashing down, unfortunately. The original Jaws was made on a very tight budget, and its director realised that he could not rely on effects to carry the day. He therefore decided to focus upon the human element, and filled his cast with the best cheap talent he could get his hands upon. Whether it was his direction or their ability, the performances manage to keep the viewer focused upon something other than the cheapness of the effects. Although you might forget the name of the characters, you won't forget the men who played them in a real hurry. Which is exactly the problem here. As in Alien 3, the characters are unmemorable because they don't have anything remotely approaching a second dimension.I gave Jaws 3-D a one out of ten. As a serious horror or drama, it sucks dead bunnies through a straw. As a comedy, it works better than the Marx Brothers at times. Jaws The Revenge was so bad it was incredible. Jaws 3-D was so bad that it is legendary.

It feels more like a actual parody, a la Airplane, of the previous Jaws movies and their countless imitators that you keep waiting for Leslie Nielsen to appear.

Jaws 2 was a production whose rushed schedule showed clearly in every frame, but at least it made a noble effort to be good and still capture not only the same thrills, but the same charm as the original. So it wasn't dismal when it failed. However, with the revival of the wildly over-hyped and unnecessary 3D format of movies came the third installment, Jaws III also known as Jaws 3D. A little time has passed since the second movie. Martin Brody's (Roy Scheider from the first two movies) sons have grown up and one of them (a young Dennis Quaid) is a maintenance manager at Sea World. During his brother's (John Putch) visit, a great white shark busts through the underwater gates and begins to snack on people who venture into the park's waters. Eventually, the shark is captured, which leads to a jaw-dropping discovery the shark is a baby. So ignoring the fact that in reality sharks do *not* care for their offspring, the cardboard cut-out characters declare that its 35-foot-long mother must also be on the loose on opening day, of all times.Gone are the thrills and gone are the great characters. Looking back on the original Jaws and having the chance to see it in a theater for the first time (and meeting its screenwriter, the knowledgeable Carl Gottlieb) I am only further reminded of how strongly that movie succeeded because of three sharply-written, characteristic-packed characters who we believe in as human beings. They were essentially cutouts (a police chief, a mad hunter, a biologist) expanded into personalities we could relate to, people we liked, so that we rooted for the humans and condemned the sharks. Well, the characters here are more cutouts, but they remain so. Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong do what they can, but they have nothing to expand their characters upon. Their motives and scenarios are flat, their passion nonexistent. The same applies for the supporting cast, with nobody standing out.For the record, I have only seen the two-dimensional format of this picture. Reportedly the movie is no longer available for 3D viewing because it was so cheaply done and looking at the film, I can see why. Because even if the optical hocus pocus were handled well, it would not excuse the incredibly cheap visual effects. Oftentimes when the shark attacks, it uses the same gimmick. First of all, the tracking point-of-view shot which was so terrifying in the original movie and so redundant in the sequels. The camera zooms in on the victim, in a close-up so extreme that we can hardly see anything, the screen goes red, and then out of plume of over-lit blood we see a digital image meant to be a severed head or leg float toward the screen. If it jumped out at you, it would only increase the stultifying reality of how fake it is. Sometimes the movie even throws in cheap gimmicks for a 3D shot for no reason at all, such as a ludicrous shot where the camera zooms in upon a masthead-like sculpture protruding over the entrance to an exhibit. Does the object have any plot relevance or does it even look particularly good? No. So why include this track-in shot? So the filmmakers could make a thing stand out for no particular reason.There are a great many horrid effects shots in the movie. Bad underwater sculpture and set design, including a submersible that was all too obviously a toy tricked into the shot. Effects like this had been done better twenty years before. As for the shark, the filmmakers make the dumb decision of using live shark footage for most of the scenes. As with the second movie, we see a lot of the shark this time around and by showing so much live shark footage and so few animatronics (which aren't too good this time around) the comparison is only more jarring. Sometimes the shark is also a digital effect, including an infamous shot where it rams through an aquarium glass, also not-so-convincing. And then there is a cheap rubber model used for the baby shark, which looks like something taken out of a TV movie.Actually, the whole movie seems like something taken out of a TV movie. It was directed by Joe Alves, the production designer for the previous two movies and unfortunately his directing talents are far below his ability to create models, animatronics, and sets. With many logical errors (such as a shark out-swimming a motorboat), lackluster character development, horrid special effects, and a distinct lack of joy, Jaws III results in being a very forgettable production. I guess that's the best I can say about it. That although it bored me as I watched it, I found no difficulty in forgetting the experience the following morning.

For one, its pacing is reminiscent of one of the early Friday the 13th films in terms of being very slow (only this time, it doesn't amount to anything remotely frightening), and, to compare it to Friday the 13t Part 3 - the infamous 3D chapter of the series - it's one gigantic gimmick to showcase its 3D effects. So what happens when you take away that gimmick, like when Jaws 3 was down-converted in the process of its home video release? At the time, VHS and Betamax, the two formats during the film's release, couldn't manage 3D capability, so as a result, the medium that made Jaws 3 different from many horror films was suddenly taken away and what was left was nothing but a bland, interchangeable affair, with poor special effects, little pacing, and the power to be forgotten hours after being viewed.The story, for the first time, takes place away from Amity Island and is now at SeaWorld, where underwater tunnels are being constructed for a new exhibit. Employees, including marine biologist Kay Morgan (Bess Armstrong) and Michael Brody (Dennis Quaid), discover that a baby shark has slipped through one of the underwater tunnels and may be responsible for several disappearances in the park. Upon being captured, more still disappear, and it becomes clear the real killer was the mother great white shark and not her offspring. This sends the SeaWorld staff into a panicking frenzy, unsure of what exactly to do about their shark problem.The one common criticism I have for all of the Jaws sequels is their slowness in progression. In the first film, the shark didn't appear until roughly the hour mark, giving us time to acquaint ourselves with the staff of the beach, the area of Amity Island, and be smitten with Spielberg's clear direction and Verna Fields' priceless editing. In the sequels, the time between the opening credits and the first time we saw the shark is nothing but bloated filler; the film giving us an illusion that it has characters to care about, places to go, suspense to have us experience, and tension in its scenes. They have nothing. Even when they look like they do, they still flounder under the emptiness of their own screenplays. The times the shark wasn't on screen, I wanted to see one. The times they came on screen, I simply wanted the film to end.Jaws 3's most fascinating feature, however, is not its inclusion of 3D, or its release history. It's that the man credited for the story is a man by the name of Guerdon Trueblood. Starring Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong. Directed by Joe Alves.

Anyway, once Jaws 3 starts proper we are introduced to Micheal 'Mike' Brody (Dennis Quaid), the son of police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider, who does not appear in Jaws 3) from Jaws (1975) & Jaws 2 (1978). Mike works as the chief underwater engineer at a marine amusement park called Sea World which is dubbed 'The World's Largest Marine Park', somewhere in Florida, as coincidence would have it his girlfriend Dr. Kathryn 'Kathy' Morgan (Bess Armstrong) also works there as a marine biologist. A new attraction called the Undersea Kingdom, which is an enclosed lagoon with transparent underwater corridors that people can walk through, is being shown off to the press & public in a preview weekend. One of the parks workers named Shelby Overman (Harry Grant) dives into the Undersea Kingdom to try & repair some damaged gates, while down there he is viciously attacked by a Great White Shark. Shelby's girlfriend turns up at Seaworld the next day & complains to Mike that he didn't come home the previous night, concerned for his safety Mike & Kathy dive into Undersea Kingdom's lagoon to look for him. While conducting their search they are attacked by a Great White Shark but both manage to escape unharmed. Back on dry land a cocky adventurer named Philip FitzRoyce (Simon MacCorkindale) wants to destroy the Shark & film it, but Kathy wants to capture it & persuades Sea Worlds owner Calvin Bouchard (Louis Gossett Jr.) that it would be good for business to have a Great White Shark as an attraction. They successfully capture the Shark but it dies soon after & that makes it's enormous 35 foot plus Mother very unhappy. With an entire amusement park & lots of people to terrorise no one in the water is safe as she seeks revenge...Directed by Joe Alves who was the production designer on the first two Jaws films I quite liked Jaws 3 even if going by some of the reviews & comments most people seem to think that it's just about the worst film ever, well forget about that as it's nowhere near. I will openly admit that the script by Carl Gottlieb, Micheal Kane & Richard Matheson isn't the best ever but it moves along at a fair pace & I liked the setting & overall story even if it's complete total & utter nonsense in a factual & scientific sense. Sharks don't swim backwards, they definitely don't growl or roar & have no maternal instincts towards their young. I suppose you have to take the good with the bad if you know what I mean, & it is just at heart a horror film after all isn't it? Director Alves unfortunately fails to create much tension, excitement or atmosphere during the infrequent Shark attacks although I love the way FitzRoyce was eaten/crushed with the camera placed in the back of the Sharks mouth showing us what we would see if we were being eaten, a really cool & memorable scene that's probably worth an extra star or two on it's own. Alves also fails somewhat when it comes to the dramatics out of the water with the human cast, the relationships & characters aren't that interesting. The shots which are supposed to use the 3-D effects are fairly obvious & as a result I felt one or two bits here & there looked a little out of place, having said that I quite liked the odd strange shot especially when the Shark was blown to pieces at the end & it's teeth & gums shoot towards to camera! The special effects in Jaws 3 are pretty poor, some of the optical effects are absolutely awful in particular the mini submarine underwater & the Shark 'gliding' towards the control room at the end as it breaks the glass in another obvious 3-D shot. Surprisingly there are a few good gore scenes in Jaws 3, a severed arm & some quite graphic shots of a mutilated body complete with a sea creature sliding out of it's mouth. The huge mechanical Shark looks good for the most part, especially it's mouth & teeth. Technically Jaws 3 is OK apart from those poor optical effects, nothing outstanding but nothing too bad either. John Williams unforgettable theme is used at times but the rest of the music by Alan Parker simply can't come anywhere near to matching it. The acting is OK by all involved even if they don't seem to be putting too much effort into it. Overall I quite liked Jaws 3, it moves along at a fair pace & kept me entertained for it's 100 odd minute running time without too much trouble. So what if it's all rather silly, it's only a film after all right? In my humble opinion Jaws 3 definitely doesn't deserve to be in the IMDb's bottom 100 & is certainly worth watching if you can bag a cheap copy from somewhere or catch it on T.V. for free.

It stars Dennis Quaid, Bess Armstrong, Simon MacCorkindale, Louis Gossett Jr, John Putch & Leah Thompson. The second sequel to Steven Spielberg's Jaws, this was originally released in the 3D format that had a brief rebirth in the early to mid 1980s. Plot centres around a WaterTheme Park coming under attack from a great white shark.It was originally mooted to have been a spoof movie, along the lines of Airplane et al, now that could have worked you feel, what we actually get is an unintentional spoof movie that was made in appallingly bad 3D. Yet the 3D gimmick was enough to get the punters into the cinema and keep those tills kerchinging to the point where Universal Pictures were rather happy. Happy enough to green light another sequel, the god awful Jaws The Revenge in 1987. As I was one of those punters who shelled out for the 3D Jaws experience back in the day, I feel partly responsible for part 4 assaulting the eyes of everyone who has ever seen it.Watching it now over 25 years later in 2D, the film is actually worse than I originally remember it being. Of course now in this internet age we can find out about the numerous script tamperings that went on with it, and subsequently look at the non directing career of Alves post this fishy garbage and fully understand why. Perhaps the biggest mystery of all is how Messrs Quaid, Gossett Jr & Thompson survived to have careers afterwards? But the reality is it's not their fault, Quaid is badly underwritten and a bit too fresh faced to carry the male lead role this early in his career, Gossett Jr actually does OK in the role of SeaWorld park manager Calvin Bouchard, showing the only moments of acting gravitas as he tries to keep things under control. While Thompson is a third arc character called on to look pretty and say a couple of lines whilst trying to keep a straight face.Even if we shy away from the poor effects work, that were, yes, poor effects even in 1983, Jaws 3 has an amateurishness about it that is laughably bad. The shark sequences look like they were filmed in a bath tub with some kiddies drawing used to scale, while the dialogue, too, seems to have been lifted from a 4 year old's memoirs. Then there is the performances from the likes of Armstrong and MacCorkindale, the former is bland beyond compare, the latter is, if you pardon the pun, wetter than a fish's blanket. There's some decent choreography on show for some water skiing sequences, but even these are countered by the ineffective use of the shark. Don't believe anyone who tells you that this is still fun in a popcorn no brain kind of way, it isn't. It's as bad as its reputation says it is and it's only saving graces are Gossett Jr and that it isn't as bad as part 4. 2/10 "},{"Title":"A big mess","Date":"9 June 2011","Score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Jaws 3-D is not as bad as JawsThe Revenge, which for me is one of the worst sequels ever, but it is the complete anti-thesis of the masterpiece that is Spielberg's original film. Even the second film was better, and while I would hardly call that film a masterpiece, it was watchable.One major problem with this film is that it's dull, in my opinion that is. I wouldn't have minded so much the sluggish pace if the suspense and plot were up to par. Sadly, neither are. The plot is both unoriginal and close to being a non-event.The suspense, tension and thrills were what made the original so memorable, there is next to none of that here. The music and direction do not help. The music feels very predictably placed sometimes which spoils the mood of the scene, and the direction feels pedestrian and tired.The locations are pretty good, they're not what makes the film so dull and cheap visually. That's the fault of the slip-shod editing and the rubbish effects, with the shark completely lacking menace and feeling incredibly gimmicky. Jaws 3-D also has some cheesy and trite dialogue and superficial characters that you don't care for at all.The acting is poor. Dennis Quaid has a badly-written character, and sadly in his performance he lets that show. The other actors are either bland or annoying.So overall, while not as bad as Revenge the film is a big mess. 1/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"Ten reasons to see JAWS 3-D","Date":"13 December 2004","Score":"2 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" 1.

Basically the Brody brothers, Michael 'Mike' (Dennis Quaid) and Sean (John Putch), sons of Amity Police Chief Brody, are working at seaside park Sea World with its aquarium based attractions, and run by Calvin Bouchard (An Officer and a Gentleman's Razzie nominated Louis Gossett Jr.). Sean meets Kelly Ann Bukowski (Back to the Future's Lea Thompson) and Michael's girlfriend Kathryn Morgan (Bess Armstrong) who work with the two dolphins Cindy and Sandy (Razzie winning Shrieking Dolphins), and do their parts to keep the place going. Soon enough Sea World, with its new underwater glass tunnels is endangered by a baby great white shark and decide to catch it to put on display, but it soon dies after not great treatment. They realise that the recent attacks in the open, caused by a shark, couldn't have been made by this baby, they are now on the lookout for the large mother that killed Shelby Overman (Harry Grant). It soon shows up and traps many visitors and the water park staff inside the leaking underwater dome, and the only way to kill the shark is to do the same as the previous film, electrocute him and have his jaws come towards us. Also starring Simon MacCorkindale as Philip FitzRoyce and Lock, Stock and Two Barrels' P.H. Moriarty as Jack Tate. Once again the shark, the rubber one nicknamed Bruce, doesn't scare you anymore, and even with the tell-tell signs that this film sued to be in 3D, like the shark crashing into the glass with shards coming towards you, it is just stupid. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Director for Joe Alves, Worst New Star for Worst Screenplay, Worst Picture and there was a Worst Career Achievement Award for Bruce the rubber shark from all three films.

Park creator (Louis Gossett, Jr.) is about to open a new attraction when a Great White shark gets into the park and begins its destruction. It's pretty clear that the only reason this movie was made was to cash in on the title as well as the 3-D effects, which were becoming popular again. I've heard from countless people that this film was one of the worst looking 3-D movies and that's pretty easy to see even when viewing it in 2-D. I was surprised to see how poorly this film was shot and at times how dark the footage actually is. Just take a look at the sequence where they're trying to lure the shark into the tunnel. This entire sequence is so dark that you'd think someone dropped some ink on the film print. The actual story of a shark entering Sea World just doesn't work for a number of reasons. For starters, there's really no epic feel of an ocean going on here. Having everything taking place in the park just gives the film a very small feel to it. It also doesn't help that the shark really doesn't get to attack very many people here. The film really doesn't have any guts as no one we care about every gets attacked and for the most part we get poorly constructed characters who are going to be the obvious bait. The shark here is also rather mixed. We get some footage of a real shark thrown in yet this ends up being a major goof because when the shark is actually captured and brought into a tank, it's obviously a lot smaller than the one we see used in the real footage. The shark itself looks okay but I can't say it was better than the previous two. It's certainly the biggest of the three but this is pretty much wasted as she (yes, it's a girl) doesn't get to do too much. I'm really not sure why'd they'd spend the money to build this thing and then not do much with it. What's most shocking about this film is the fact that the performances are probably the best thing. Both Quaid and Armstrong are good but they're obviously drowning in a bad screenplay. Lea Thompson is cute in her few moments here but Gossett is pretty much wasted. He turns in a fine performance but there's just not much he can do with the character. As far as the attacks go, we get one great one where we see the killing from inside the shark's mouth. This scene is worth sitting through everything else. The ending with the shark breaking through the glass is just silly and pretty much sums up everything you need to know about this movie. I'm not sure if the original idea of having a spoof would have worked any better but this here is certainly the least in the series and one that can easily be forgotten. It should be noted however that Universal pulled the plug on the 1981 Italian rip-off GREAT WHITE, which borrowed dialogue, scenes and stories from the first two films in the series. Universal got GREAT WHITE pulled from theaters yet they in return rip that movie off with plenty of stuff that ended up in this film. My advice would be to track down a copy of that movie.
