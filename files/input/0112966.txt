The story is simply about a pair of cartographers (map makers) who measure a hill in Wales and much to the displeasure of the locals, it isn't tall enough to be considered a mountain, which is what the townsfolk always considered it. So, the locals work together to build it up so it will qualify to be officially labeled a mountain. Sounds simple and even stupid, but it isn't. Along the way, a romance buds between Hugh Grant and Tara Fitzgerald. There also is some nice cinematography in here.Some might find it boring but I didn't. There was just something about this, a charm that made me feel good as I watched it and had me smiling even more by the end. This is a sleeper, a movie you might pass up..... but don't.

It's a crime that one of Hugh Grant's best films is hardly ever mentioned in interviews with him or articles about him, and is usually only listed in complete listings of Grant's films.  Written and directed by Christopher Monger, and based on a (true?) story told to him by his grandfather, the film is set in rural South Wales during World War One.  The story centers around two surveyors, one played by Grant, sent to map the terrain of South Wales.  Using a village as a base, the surveyors redefine a local mountain as a hill, causing much consternation among the villagers.  The villagers engage in devious activities to keep the surveyors in the village, while they literally add height to the hill to make it a mountain.  Hugh Grant is on top form as the shy and inarticulate surveyor, and is helped by an excellent supporting cast.  Beautiful cinematography and appropriately celtic music are icing on the cake of this thoroughly enjoyable film. Like Local Hero, The Englishman is made in the style of the British Ealing comedies of the forties, and in this reviewers opinion, captures even more successfully the spirit of a small rural village taking on and beating the system.

The writer and many of the names in the credits have Welsh sounding names. The scenery is beautiful and the characters are delightfully observed. It is a piece set at the time of the First World War. It has echoes of Under Milk Wood, of The Shooting Party, and of Clochemerle. Kenneth Griffith was memorable in Clochemerle and plays the Reverend Jones in this film.   At first, Hugh Grant seems to be playing yet another floppy haired, romantic hero, but as the film unfolds, there is greater depth to his character. The harsh reality of mining is simply portrayed and we are reminded of the heightened need for coal in wartime. The Great War itself casts a shadow over the whole village, making the film poignant and touching.

They plot to keep the men in the village until they can pile enough earth on top of their hill to make it over 1000ft and win back their mountain.This film starts strong with a great sense of humour that it can't quite sustain but is enough to win you over and get into the story.  The romance doesn't come into the film until he second half but the whole film is very gentle and winning so that it all just flows together so very effortlessly.  The humour at the top is a little sharper and it gets progressively slighter and mushier as it goes but it still works well.  Anyone who loves the Ealing comedies should enjoy this, as it appears to aspire to that mould.I really dislike Grant and find his whole stuttering, blinking act to be annoying most of the time &#150; Mickey Blue Eyes is an example of the sort of performance that makes me want to give up hope for cinema.  However here it works dammit!  He does his usual stuff but it fits perfectly because his character has no malice and doesn't go against the stuttering etc.  The support cast is rich with humour.  Fitzgerald likewise keeps it all fizzy and superficial as the tone requires and Meaney is suitably funny.  Griffith is very good and Hart is a surprising cameo even if his character is a little too serious for the piece.Overall this is very slight and has a great feel of whimsy about it.  If you're not in the mood for this sort of thing then it's light nature may annoy you but it was just the ticket for me and I really enjoyed it.

Never been a Hugh Grant fan because he is almost always the same in everything he does so the novelty of the  English Fop has worn off for me. Tara Fitzgerald always plays the sexy girl and, to be honest, I have never been a fan of her acting style, despite doing a good welsh accent. No, this film for me, which, despite my criticism of the leads, is one of my favorite movies because of its fantastic supporting cast. Colm Meaney is always good value and Ian Mcniece always adds quality to everything he does. However, getting back to my opening statement, it was Ian Hart's performance that moved me the most. It goes to prove that you don't have to have many lines or a leading role to turn in a masterful performance. In every scene he appeared in, he just excelled. To portray someone who has suffered the horrors of the trenches of World War 1 is not easy and it would have been easy to overdo it but he doesn't. The scene on top of the mountain after the lightning strike where, mentally, he is transported back to the horrors of the trenches, was truly moving. When Williams brings him back to the pub, again, despite what is going on with other characters and their dialog, we are drawn to him. He truly owns the scene. In every scene that we see him in, it is the haunted look that we see on his face, in his eyes, that truly captures the underlying theme of this movie - the desire for something good to come out of such hard times; a community that has lost so much desperately trying to recapture its pride by ensuring Ffynnon Garw is retained as Wales first mountain. Johnny is one that came home when the rest of the villages young men are unlikely to. He is one that the village is trying to cling onto although, most of the time, he is just beyond their reach. He is there in the flesh but not truly in spirit. Pivotal moments - standing up and speaking about the trenches at the village meeting. I loved the Reverand Jones reaction to Johnny speaking - the tears in his eyes, trying not to break down. Johnny is the one, probably the only one in the village, who is able to make the Reverand and Morgan the Goat set aside their differences. I loved the shot of Johnny after the breakdown when the voice-over speaks of the days of rain that followed. In one frame, Hart perfectly captures the haunted and damaged young man that Johnny is. I loved it when Johnny tells the School teacher to  Stop acting so English and I absolutely ADORED Johnny's epiphany near the end of the movie where he decides it is time to stop being afraid and face his fear. The camera zooming right into him so that the entire screen is his. The village applauding his arrival to the top of the mountain was magical. One of their sons was home at last. He was finally back with them. Of course you could just see this movie as a heart warming comedy - and sure, it can be enjoyed this way but I would urge all of you, if not already, to go back and watch it again from the perspective I have illustrated. As an actor, Ian Hart is a master, and in his portrayal as Johnny Shell Shocked, a master is truly at work. Any aspiring actor would do well to get this man's entire back catalog on DVD to see how it ought to be done.

It stars Hugh Grant, Ian McNeice, Tara Fitzgerald, Colm Meaney and Kenneth Griffith. Music is by Stephen Endelman and cinematography by Vernon Layton.Set in 1917, plot finds Grant and McNeice as two English cartographers who arrive in the Welsh village of Ffynnon Garw to measure what the locals proudly proclaim to be Wales' first mountain. However, it turns out that the mountain is 16 feet below the required 1000 feet requisite so therefore can only be classed as a hill. This news causes disgust amongst the locals, who then set about stopping the cartographers going home whilst they attempt to build atop of the hill to make it over 1000 feet.A film with a big title that is matched by the size of its heart, Monger's film owes much to those fun community based pictures that filed out of Ealing Studios back in the 40s and 50s, Re Whisky Galore! and The Titfield Thunderbolt. We can also safely place it the whimsy category where something as wonderful as Local Hero sits, while the old British comedy staple that encompasses an obsession with size (The Mouse That Roared) watches over the film like an approving British cinematic angel.Homespun humour marries up with the utterly engaging view of quirky village life to provide us with just under 100 minutes of entertainment. Although clearly simple in plot and structure, to simply dismiss it as such does not do justice to the fine work of the ensemble cast and the writing of Ivor and Chris Monger. With Grant doing what he does best, the amiable nervous fop, picture has a lead actor fully comfortable with the tone and texture of the production, while around him there are a number of fine character actors putting delightful meat on the comedy bones of oddball characters with names such as Morgan the Goat, Johny Shellshock, William the Petroleum and Betty from Cardiff! Best of the bunch is Griffith as Reverend Jones, a grumpy, stubborn eccentric who underpins everything so wonderfully skew-whiff about life in Ffynnon Garw.As for the writing? The screenplay has a wonderful ear for small village dialogue, while in amongst the value of community spirit theme, sits a near sombre observation of the effects of war on such a community. The production design is appealing, with Layton's photography around the Powys locations a visual treat, and Endelman's music has a suitably warming and jaunty feel; even if it starts to get a touch repetitive later in the piece. It doesn't have widespread appeal, it's clearly a film aimed at a small portion of film fans that love those films mentioned earlier. But in an era when film is being smothered by CGI and visual gimmickry, revisiting something like The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain offers up a most refreshing and diverting experience. 8/10 "},{"Title":"An unexpected treasure--solid entertainment","Date":"19 June 2006","Score":"6 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" I stumbled upon this movie on cable on a lazy summer afternoon. What a delight! It was beautiful, well-acted all around, and very funny. I was totally charmed by the movie from beginning to end. I couldn't help root for the village in their nonsensical quest, and I was totally drawn in by their attempts to keep the cartographers around. This is a light-hearted movie, but what it says about the horrible losses experienced by the UK in WWI and the sense of community of small towns in a simpler time gives the movie a stature that brings it far above a mere piece of fluff.This must be the only non-History-channel movie in existence with a cartographer as a lead role!! I just returned from a trip to England, and I am married to a man who was a cartographer for many years, so perhaps I was predisposed to like the movie. I also visited one of the vast British WWI cemeteries in northern France (Etaples), which moved me deeply. We Americans are woefully ignorant of the huge losses of promising young men that the British sustained during that war. The character Johnny Shell-shocked in this movie gives but a hint of the horror and emotional damage sustained by those who survived. As with everything else in this movie, it was handled with restraint and grace. Given what many of our own young people are experiencing today in Iraq, that sub-plot may have extra resonance with many viewers.Fix yourself a cup of strong, hot tea (or a pint of ale), adjust your ears to thick Welsh accent and sit back and enjoy an entertaining, thoughtful little movie.

They are doing surveying work for the government to look over the mountains of Wales The village is proud of the mountain just behind it, which for ages has been called the first great mountain of Wales. The two men measure the mountain and find it is 984 feet tall. Unfortunately, it has been determined that mountains must be 1,000 feet tall at least. So this mountain is not a mountain but a hill!Angry, the villagers determine to try to undue this mistake. First they have to keep the Englishmen in the village long enough for a second measurement of the mountain to be made. Second, they have to organize all the members of the village into working together to add some twenty feet to the hill and make it a mountain again.What follows is a comedy of clashing nationalities (Welsh v. English), particularly the obnoxious senior member of the surveying team, George (Ian MacNeice) who constantly belittles the locals, and who even says how much he hates them (then why did he take this job one wonders). The nicer, more amenable younger member of the team, Anson (Hugh Grant), is willing to observe what the community wants to accomplish (especially after he meets a local girl, Betty (Tara Fitzgerald)). Led by the local publican Morgan the Goat (Colm Meaney - from the various STAR TREK series), the locals try to keep George occupied by disabling his car, and lying about the local train service, and giving him as much gin as he likes. Anson proves far less hostile, and actually ends helping them.The Welsh are also split. Morgan is a wizard at organization, but nobody trusts him. Least of all the local spiritual leader, Rev. Jones (Kenneth Griffiths). When the townspeople are building the mountain up the first time, Jones notes that Morgan is making a mint out of selling beer to the parched men involved. Jones also has problems with the local schoolteacher, the Anglophile Mr. Davies (Garfield Morgan), who does not think his little charges should have a day off - in order to help build up a mountain. The weather turns hostile with heavy rains. Time is running out. Will the locals turn the hill into a mountain or will they have to accept the hill is only a hill?Well made, and funny (and sad at one or two points, when the effects of the war and the death of a leading character appear in the screenplay), the movie is well worth watching, and a definite 10 out of 10.

Unfortunately most of the magnificent peaks straddle the border between England and Wales, and they cannot be considered wholly Welsh in their own rights. Somewhere deep in Welsh-land, a village nestles in tranquility amidst rolling hills and green pastures. There was this particularly large mound in the terrain, and the villagers are proud to call it the mountain of Ffynnon Garw. Its the first mountain in Wales!, remarks a villager.Hugh Grant, cast as a English cartographer, is tasked to measure the exact height of Ffynnan Garw, and he bears unfortunate news to the villagers, that Fynnan Garw, at 980 feet, is 20 feet shy to qualify as a mountain, and hence won't appear in Her Majesty's Map.Now the Welsh are a proud race. One only needs to take a leaf from Ryan Giggs, the Welsh soccer wizard who actually turned down playing for England in favour of Wales, and missed out competing in the World Cup altogether. ( On second thoughts, he didn't miss much. England the soccer team stutters much like Hugh Grant the Englishman.) The mere suggestion of Ffynnon Garw as a hill would have the villagers absolutely livid. The only thing worse than that is to have an Englishman tell them that.Springing into action, the villagers decide to add twenty feet to the hill. It isn't such an easy task, considering the village has most of its able-bodied young men fighting the Great War in France. It is up to the women and children to rally for this valiant effort. Hugh Grant and his superior, a destestable Englishman with a huge potbelly and an even bigger head, are anxious to move on. Other hills are waiting for them to be measured. That's when Tara Fitzgerald, as an endearing village girl Betty, enters the story to try to charm the cartographers into staying for a few more days. And just in case, the Welsh make sure Grant's car was rendered useless, and they were left stranded in the village of Ffynnon Garw, with nothing more to do but to re-assess its status as a hill.Grant plays his usual stuttering and apologetic self. While I felt his stuttering was way overdone, he comes across as very likable and a seriously nice gentleman. Beneath his self-effacing behaviour is a man who knows when to assert himself. There was this one and only time when faced with a medical emergency, he actually orders his boss to bugger off. (Bugger off is one endearing phrase he utters throughout his movie career, if you haven't noticed.) Tara Fitzgerald appears as the romantic interest of Grant. The little game of seduction she plays makes your heart yearn once more for the high-school romances that once were sweet and whimsical. Colm Meaney is memorable as Morgan the Goat, the one magnetic personality who galvanises the village into action with his fiery ways and charms viewers with his cheeky ways.This is not a Grant vehicle. His vehicle would be About a Boy. If anything, this is simply a vehicle for the Welsh fighting spirit which resides in the heart of every Welshman.Who should stay away  Those who abhor spending Sundays at the picnic, those who can't stand Hugh Grant, and Welsh people, in the same vein as how Parisians stay away from Amelie.

Rallied by their minister, the entire town sets about making sure it's tall enough.This sweet and folksy comedy has a thin plot and moves at a snail's pace, but still succeeds thanks to the coziness of the village, the close bond the locals share, and Hugh Grant's boyish charms. Filmed just after Four Weddings and a Funeral, but before he was an international star, Grant is bright, likable, and interesting and not-yet affected by his trademark stammering and eyelash-fluttering.

But much of the enjoyment of this film is in the character studies. It so nicely gives us a look at several people and their Welshness. I can't say how folks from Wales may like the depictions; but they are curious, warm, friendly, and very real people shown in this film. All the acting is first-rate. Colm Meany and Kenneth Griffith play wonderfully off each other as pub-owner Morgan the Goat and Reverend Jones, respectively. Hugh Grant is very good in one of his most laid back comedy roles &#x96; here as a naturally shy young veteran from WW I. Tara Fitzgerald is very good as Betty. The rest of the cast make up a wonderful variety of different, if not eccentric, characters. This is not a comedy of rip-roaring laughter. It isn't loaded with sight-gags, or witty one-liners. There are a few clever lines, but the comedy of this film is in the everyday lives of the people of this Welsh community, and in the cunning to rouse the community to deal with a mountain of a problem. It is a very clean film, suitable for all ages and audiences. As many others have noted, it's a comedy of warmth that makes one feel good at its end. This film isn't for modern movie-goers who must have a constant flow of adrenalin. Or maybe it is &#x96; to help slow them down so they can learn to smell the roses along the way. Regarding the town's problem, it's interesting that there don't seem to be any real set standards for designation of mountains versus hills. The sources I checked seem to agree that the difference is more in the degree of steepness, rather than actual height. Funny though, that the 1,000-foot mark of distinction seemed to come from the U.S., where the British favored more a 2,000-foot mark. The outside scenes of this movie were filmed at Gyrn Moelfre, a hill or mountain in northeast Wales near the border with England. It has an elevation of 1,716 feet above sea level. But it rises just 778 feet above the surrounding terrain. The movie shows people climbing the hill on a trail with switchbacks.

During their journey they reclassify a mountain as a hill, much to the chagrin of local Welsh folk, who immediately set about increasing the size of their hill so as to reclaim its mountainous status.The film was released the same year as Braveheart, Mel Gibson's bloody hymn to ye olde Scotland. Monger's film is operating in a similar way, though its far more gentle, poking fun at all things English and exalting all things Welsh. Pitched at tourists, the film's designed to win you over with its lovable locals, quaint tone, funny customs and low key romance between an Englishman and Welsh rose.The film is supposedly based on a true story, or at least a local legend. Regardless, in Monger's hands the hill becomes a means of restoring both the Welsh community's war damaged self esteem within the film, and a means of bolstering Welsh patriotism outside the film. The National Assembly for Wales, which grants Wales the power to pass legislation without having to consult the UK parliament, was formed shortly after the film's release. Meanwhile, the cast's uncertainty as to what makes a hill and what makes a mountain (and when does one become the other?) is used as a means of cross-cultural bridge-building.

What was right was to try to represent deeply held values and emotional personalities in the brief time and plot space of a lovingly made film. Apart from that, it was so much like when I visited Ystrad Rhondda, Treorchy, and Ebbwvale and saw the faces of my ancestors in old photographs now appear on the human faces of the locals.The Grandfather said that the story was epic. That claim is always a stretch unless the story speaks to you individually. If it resonates with your DNA, it is epic to you. My DNA is doing much better for the experience. If your DNA is not Welsh, take the time to watch a movie that speaks directly to you.Meanwhile, I am putting it back in the VCR. Best wishes to you!

They must not have multiplexes in England, or they would have never come up with a title that long. It's a quirky character study in the Local Hero mold celebrating Welsh pride, and the English penchant for pointless endeavors. It was Hugh Grant's other summer film, in and out of the theaters before he had to go on all the talk shows and confess that he never get's invited to Charlie Sheen's parties. Hugh is one of two English surveyors sent to Wales during World War One to measure the height of the mountains, in the hope that in some bizarre way this knowledge will help the war effort. The film is set in a Welsh village that proudly claims to have the first mountain in Wales. However the Englishmen find the height to be 984 feet, just 16 feet short of a mountain (after all rules are rules). What follows is predictable, but great fun. With Colm Meaney (Deep Space Nine) as the local pub owner, Tara Fitzgerald (Hear My Song) who's a very pleasant distraction for Hugh and the audience, and an assortment of English character actors attempting Welsh accents with varied success.

A true feel-good movie.I would give this movie ten stars if they had cast someone else as Reginald Anson.

It's 1917. English cartographers Reginald Anson (Hugh Grant) and George Garrad (Ian McNeice) come to the small Wales village of Ffynnon Garw. The locals consider it the first mountain inside of Wales but it has to be at least 1000ft for it to be called a mountain. Morgan the Goat (Colm Meaney) is the womanizing scheming pub owner. Everybody is shocked at the mountain being calculated as only a hill. Morgan suggests adding 20ft to the mountain, Reverend Jones demands that the soil be taken from their garden and Johnny Shellshocked (Ian Hart) convinces everybody that it can be done. Morgan schemes to keep the cartographers from leaving with the help of Betty from Cardiff (Tara Fitzgerald).It's a light fluffy little comedy. The humor is charming. It needs something with a bit of edge. Tara Fitzgerald could have been that biting edge. She needs to be in the movie right from the beginning. The romance could be much better considering the two actors. It's probably that her character is faking and his character is clueless. They don't have quite the right chemistry. The rest headed by Colm Meaney has a lot of charm and carries the day in the end.

It is so delightful and refreshing, that it is a complete gem. It ranks with the wonderful whimsical comedies made by Sandy Mackendrick, such as WHISKEY GALORE (1949). The film is directed by Christopher Monger, who also wrote the screenplay, based on a story published by his father Ifor David Monger, who in turn heard the story from his own father. It seems that the story is essentially true. Considering how astonishing the story is, that really is remarkable. The film is set in 1917 in South Wales, just north of Cardiff, in a village with a long name which only the Welsh can pronounce. The Mongers were Welsh and so was Kenneth Griffiths, whose performance as the Methodist minister Robert Jones is spectacular and inspired, one of the best-honed comic performances in a British film for decades. He was 73 at the time. The humour of this film is the gentle, gnomic and teasing humour which the English use when they are making films about how charming, but deeply odd, either the Welsh or the Scots are. In this case it's the Welsh. I am very fond of the Welsh and have spent a great deal of time in South Wales, and I love the sing-song accent of the Welsh. I think most English people are fond of the Welsh, looking upon them as a quizzical species inhabiting the far west of the island, whom they wish they could understand. There is nothing the Welsh like better than half-teasing and half-insulting Englishmen, and there is plenty of that in the film, all hilariously funny of course. And when a Welshman gets stuffy, he may have a friend say to him, as happens in this film 'Stop being so English.' Well, it is wartime and young Hugh Grant has just recovered from shell shock after taking part in the battle of Verdun, and is travelling on an assignment for the Ordnance Survey with a much older man, played by the totally hilarious Ian McKenzie. The humour in this film is all well-judged, and never over-played, though they come near it many a time. The Welsh in this village are very proud of the fact that just beyond their village is 'the first mountain in Wales', after which the mountains continue to rise up and define northern Wales. McKenzie and Grant have come to do an official survey and determine the height of the little mountain. McKenzie announces in the pub that if the mountain is less than 1000 feet high, it will be reclassified on the official maps as a hill. All of the villagers are deeply shocked, and are full of apprehension that their one claim to distinction will be taken away from them. When McKenzie and Grant are able to measure the height they find that it is 984 feet, and the mountain is therefore a hill. The whole village goes into shock, and they determine to take measures to save the reputation of their mountain. So they form chains of people to carry soil up to the top and raise the height of their hill so that it can become a mountain again. All the goings-on are so wonderfully funny and complex that they defy summary, but this film is certainly a chuckle-a-minute, punctuated by one's guffaws. About half way through the film the pretty girl, Betty, enters the story. She is played impishly and naughtily by Tara Fitzgerald. Tara and I were once 'sport champions' together in an episode hilarious enough to be in the Welsh film. My wife and I were staying with our friends the Hitchings for Christmas at Swalcliffe, and Tara was with her friends the Harrises, next door at Swalcliffe, when we all came together for purposes of merriment with a considerable amount of hearty drinking for an evening. Tara was determined to play a game of hockey, despite the fact that it was dark outside and very cold, and insisted on playing hockey on the Harris family's tennis court, which was beside their house. I had never played hockey, but because Tara is very bossy and readily takes charge (even aged 14), she soon set me straight. It was enormous fun playing hockey on a tennis court, lit only by the light that came from the windows, and with wisps of snow drifting across the court. Tara and I won a heroic victory and were much toasted. She is one hell of a gal, and as determined as they come. She always adds a note of piquancy to any film she is in, including this one. Hugh Grant was at his very best in this film, and it was only much later that he irritated everyone by becoming too self-regarding and pompous with his Hacked Off campaign. Who cares if Hugh Grant's phone was bugged? I don't. He probably only talked a load of rubbish anyway. But in this film he is perfectly charming, so all is well, because he was still young and unspoiled. The film really is a marvel. If only there were more like it.

It is charming and features a wonderful cast. The story is interesting and quite entertaining. However, the premise would have served better for a short film rather than a feature film. Like many of Woody Allen's movies, the small plot is stretched to suit a film far too long for the idea. This film should have been 40 or so minutes long. Even 70 minutes would have been too long for this type of story. Even though it's a pretty short film in its own right, it was still too long for its story.

All of a sudden, and quite unexpectedly, two English cartographers from the British Army show up to take a measurement of the hill and - to the horror of the town - the mountain is found to be 984 feet tall - 16 feet short of the 1000 feet required to be included on the map as a mountain.Set during the First World War, this movie presents an interesting picture of Welsh nationalism. In today's world, nationalism has acquired something of a bad name. It leads to feelings of superiority, racism, violence, terrorism and wars. The nationalism depicted here seemed to me to be of a more positive type. It wasn't about putting anyone down - it was about these villagers finding something about themselves and their land to take pride in without insulting anyone else - although it's clear that they themselves felt insulted by these two Englishmen having the nerve to question whether their mountain was really just a hill, and they set out to do something about it! One of the great lines in the movie was if this isn't a mountain, we might as well be in England. The movie features good, if not overpowering, performances from pretty much everyone. Hugh Grant as the sympathetic Englishman Anson, and Ian McNeice as his less sympathetic partner - who considers the Welsh to be foreigners - do a fine job, and Colm Meaney has a very significant and well-played role as Morgan the Goat (there's some great humour here about Welsh names, that add to an overall wonderful, if somewhat low key, sense of humour throughout.) Tara Fitzgerald was also very good as Betty from Cardiff, who eventually becomes Anson's romantic interest, and also worth noting is Kenneth Griffith as Rev. Jones.Overall, this is a very pleasant journey of self-discovery for almost every character in the movie, and it's immensely enjoyable. 7/10 "}{"Title":"Building a mountain out of a molehill has a whole new meaning for me now","Date":"6 September 2007","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain is a film that reminds me of The Dish. These are two films that are charming and even modest. Qualities you don't usually find in the Hollywood mainstream nowadays. Another similarity they share is that they both feature monumental events that happen to rural, smalltown folk, and they're directed by natives to they're respective areas. In this film's case, Wales.Set in 1917, in the town of Ffynnon Garw (Welsh names are the worst!), two cartographers Reginald Anson and George Garrad (Hugh Grant and Ian McNeice) pay a visit to survey the land. Their primary interest is to measure the town's local mountain, something the townspeople take great pride in. But they're in for a rude awakening when Anson & Garrad discover they're 'mountain' is not a mountain at all. Just a really large hill.A mountain has to be at least 1000 feet. Ffynnon Garw's hill measures up to 980 feet tops. So its a big hill to be sure. But its still just a hill. The townspeople are devastated to learn this. So they set a plan in motion. Morgan the Goat (Colm Meaney), the town's local barkeep rallies the people together to build an extra mound on top of their hill, and turn it into a mountain.TEWWUAHBCDAM is a film of simple pleasures. But that's where its appeal lies. These people are so incensed by this apparent loss to their culture that they're prepared to bend the rules to restore their former glory. And who wouldn't love the film's idea of transforming a hill into a mountain by just going that little extra distance?The building of the mountain becomes a unifying force for the town and a newfound symbol of hope. Especially since these people have lost a lot of their self-esteem and drive because of WW1. But this new project brings them together and helps them to get back a lot of their faith in themselves. And director Christopher Monger puts these points across without hammering them home.Hugh Grant is not one of my favourite actors in the world. I personally think he's an annoyingly pretentious performer. The only time he's ever watchable is when he's served by an engaging storyline or a witty screenplay. And this film happens to be one of them. He basically falls into his standard, one-note style of acting throughout. In other words, bumbling, foppish and stammering. But at least the intensely likable storytelling allows his character to prevail, despite Grant's shortcomings as an actor.The supporting cast are quite a different kettle of fish. They're all wonderful, and they all have something to add.Colm Meaney's Morgan is my favourite of all the townsfolk. His character is interesting because he swings between ambiguous extremes. Someone who is on the one hand a concerned member of the community, and on the other a self-serving huckster prepared to use the town's dilemma to profit from it. Its a well written part, and well played too by the underrated Colm Meaney.This being a Hugh Grant film, there has to be a love interest for him. And Tara Fitzgerald is superb as Betty from Cardiff. She's not only here as a romantic love interest, but her role is tied into the plot too. She's there to keep Anson distracted while the townsfolk build they're mountain. She'll keep him from leaving town, and when the mountain is ready, he can re-measure it, and put things to rights.Tara Fitzgerald may be a little too modern for a Welsh lass of 1917, but I liked her spirited, twinkly eyed flirtatiousness. Her relationship with Grant is never more than amiable, but she's so appealing in the role, you really are convinced that Anson would be prepared to settle down with her. I know I would!Monger adds the occasional hindrance to increase tension. Such as a torrential downpour that could make short work of the townspeople's hard work. But that all comes with the territory. And the final scene. Where the town vicar passes away on the hill, and his buried earth is used to complete the mountain is clever and moving too.The question of whether or not they'll finish they're mountain is hardly a mystery. But did you really want anything less? Complimented by a lovely lyrical musical score, The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain is a gently amusing unappreciated treat, and one of the few gracious films to be seen on TV nowadays.

Those of us in the local area got the chance to have a good long laugh at ourselves and people we know who really are like that (note, most of us aren't like that but we still have these very stereotypes of neighbouring valley communities with whom we are in competition). It was certainly an excellent comedy piece. Despite the fact I traditionally dislike Hugh Grant and the films he's in, this film was worth watching. I don't see the film translating too well to people who don't undestand the quirky sense of humour of those of us who live around Cardiff, Newport and the related valleys. We have several hills here that were artificially boosted to claim mountain status, the hill depicted in this film (Garth Hill) wasn't the only example of this madness occurring. It's worth pointing out that this film isn't representative of Wales and Welsh history as a whole. We've got a tribal history and the land is still extremely variable in culture and outlook. I've lived in several different places in Wales - North, South, East and West - and can say with authority that the Welsh people with the quirkiest sense of humour are definitely located in the Heads of the Valleys region where this film is set. Maybe that's why we enjoyed the film when Welsh people in other parts of Wales were insulted? Never mind, some of us got the joke but then, since the writer/director of this film is native to the area himself, I'm not particularly surprised. )Don't take the film seriously, enjoy it as a comedy and it's a downright amusing way to pass the time.

Although it is definitely a comedy, still it shows the devastation and loss experienced by the home front during WWI and how the community suffers and yet survives. The comedy plays against this serious theme with the quirky characters in the village and the humorous attempts they make to keep two traveling map makers in the village long enough so they can add twenty feet to their hill so that it will be a mountain on the maps, which is has been until the map makers found that it fell short of the thousand foot definition.I give it ***1/2 out of ****.

Based on a real Welsh legend that may or may not be true.Contrary to popular opinion, Hugh Grant doesn't stammer his way through every role, but he does here. Late in the movie, the characteristic is justified in a gently moving way, which makes it forgivable to me. Besides, I don't mind Grant's stammer. Hugh Grant reminds me of the stars of an earlier era -- he plays one character remarkably well, and is rarely given a chance to play anyone else. The Englishman... is a movie of wonderful small moments, comedy without slapstick, wit without bitterness, and a graceful touch with small character sketches.

It was a very innocent, relaxed movie (then again, Hugh Grants stars in little else than that particular type of film) and it was shot in an absolutely gorgeous location.  I can honestly say I find it simple to understand why one would NOT enjoy this movie, but if you're in the mood for a cute, romantic comedy that will make you smile or want to gag, depending on what kind of person you happen to be. I love my action-packed, plot saturated adventures and such, of course, but a laid-back, rustic film like this was a pleasant change from the usual box-office hit.  The acting isn't really anything special, although I did enjoy the performance given by Colm Meaney, and the plot doesn't change much once you get the gist of the story line, making it pretty predictable, but it's fun to watch, I found. Basically, the plot revolves around a small, simple Welsh village around the turn of the century.  Hugh Grant stars as a puppy-dog eyed young man, as usual, who comes to the town as a cartographer measuring Ffynnon Garw, the mountain which the villagers honor as the first mountain on the Welsh border.  Of course, Mr. Reginald Anson (Hugh Grant) and his colleague (Ian McNiece) break it to the villagers that their cherished mountain is, in fact, only classified as a hill.  This news disheartens everyone in town, and they all unite to reclaim their pride and the good name of their mountain.  A small monkey wrench is thrown into Anson's plans when he happens to meet and take interest in a certain girl in the village (Tara Fitzgerald).and it really all goes from there. I'm am, by no means, saying this is the greatest film ever produced, because it is far from that.  But it's a light, cheerful romantic comedy that I think basically anyone could enjoy somehow.  If you don't enjoy the quaintness of the first 15 minutes or so, don't watch it; it won't get any better for you.  But otherwise, give it a chance, and I think you'll have a good time watching.

This is a nice gentle film about something that might seem unimportant or even faintly ridiculous - the exact height of a hill that locals consider to be 'the first mountain in Wales' - but the important thing about the plot is that this issue is important to the characters involved in the film. It is basically plot-driven - in the story of the questionable status of a local landmark and what the local people do to ensure that it is officially recognised as a mountain instead of a hill it would have to be, wouldn't it? - and it's interesting to see how the characters react to their situation. Should they bribe the cartographers? Should they increase the height of the mountain themselves? Should they accept - as the local schoolteacher suggests - that, if this hill was in another part of the world, it would be even less significant than the visiting cartographers declare it to be now?I think a great strength of this film lies in the characterisation. The diverse range of characters - from the unfathomable Reverend Jones to the mercenary schemer Morgan the Goat to the shell shocked former soldier Johnny Shellshocked and the lazy, domineering hypocritical Garrad who berates his colleague Anson's perceived laziness when he himself is clearly too hungover to even consider leaving his bed all day - is what stops the apparently perpetual stalling of the Englishmen's departure from ever becoming boring.

And more importantly, does it matter? Well, it did to the residents of a small Welsh village in 1917 when two English cartographers arrived to tell them that their 'mountain' did not in fact quite make the grade. The devastated locals hatch a plan to put the science right, and therein lies the plot of this very original and charming film.Its plot veers between the insignificant and the faintly ludicrous, but by the time you have realised this you are already enjoying yourself too much to care. Why? It's a delightful and clever combination of whimsical nostalgia and top-rate performances from some truly fine character actors who are clearly having a whale of a time.Most of these performances come as no surprise Hugh Grant plays his archetypal Hugh Grant character of course - but what critics forget is that he does it very well. Ian McNeice is typically impressive as his pompous but rather stupid superior, as is Ian Hart as the troubled young boy just back from the trenches, and Colm Meaney keeps the standard high as the sly local barman. But for me the show is stolen by Kenneth Griffith as the passionate, ever-trembling, Reverend Jones (watch him in the scene when he scolds Morgan the Goat for selling alcohol at the hill - a tremendously funny and moving characterisation).For me, the film goes off the boil a little when it gets a bogged down in Grant's inevitable fling with local temptress Tara Fitzgerald. But thankfully this doesn't clog the pace of the film too much, and we move to the denouement.It's only after the film has finished that you realise there was much more to it than met the eye. The atmospheric portrayal of early 20th century Wales owes much to meticulous direction and a wonderfully vibrant score. Critics might find some of the locals a bit yokelish, but that would be harsh, I think. This is an affectionate and subtle period piece, with something to say about the human spirit. But even more than that, it's an enjoyable, well-acted, funny and ultimately uplifting film.

The film's story takes place in 1917 and is seen through the duel shadows cast upon the local inhabitants by the local geographic prominence and War World I. While seemingly far from the carnage taking place in the trenches of France, the small Welsh village where the action takes place provides an indirect view of the sacrifice and pain caused by that war. Two of the central characters in the story were direct victims of the war, while the village itself has seen many young men march away never to return. It should be remembered that Great Britain lost nearly twice as many soldiers in World War I than in World War II. Given this backdrop, this is a classic story of divergent people putting aside their differences and through common effort coming together for the greater good.

His foil is the 80-something but believed to be 60-something Reverend Jones; this actor's performance is sheer perfection.

I felt at first it was going to be an enormous chick-flick, the story is actually much deeper than just the love connection between Grant and the local girl. It is actually a story of a town and the strength of their belief. It also portrays a small town coping with the loss of so many young men and boys to the war. While I thought it was going to be nothing but the usual Hugh Grant film, it was less about Grant and more about this little town in Wales. Based on a true story, I watched with amazement as townspeople put aside their differences, put aside their hatred, put aside their lives, to create a mountain from a hill. This mountain represented more to these people then money, then jobs, then anything that we now take for granted. Could you honestly say that if your hometown asked you to build a mountain that you would join, or would you wonder first if you had the time?I am impressed with this style of film. I have only seen a handful of films that have the theme of community as their central focus, one is going to be my movie homework, another is a great British film called Saving Grace where a community comes together to help a local widow. I did have some issues with this film. One big one was the title. Please, if you are ever going to make a film do not make the title also the plot. I mean, I think you can gather from the title what the entire film is going to be like. Another problem was that this film was too simple. I felt that some deeper sub-plot could have been created to bring some depth to this community. I think the director tried to do this with the story of the local boy who had gone to war only to return mentally unstable. I think this could have been such a great sentimental story, but it just was not developed enough. I needed to see what this boy had seen to understand his anguish and mental problems. I had to see more about his life to fully understand and fully tear up at the end when he chooses to help his neighbors build the mountain. This goes the same for the girl that Grant fell in love with. I felt that it was well too rushed. It only seemed that near the end of the film they truly loved each other and wanted to marry after only spending three to four days together. Maybe times were simpler back then, and perhaps that is another smaller theme, but I think this was a much deeper film. Deeper than I could have imagined. Bravo to Star Trek man Colm Meaney with his portrayal of Morgan the Goat. He stole this film away from Hugh. See this film if you have the chance.

And that ain't enough to be bothering with.The ambiguous nature of a film that is balanced so carefully on the border between England and Wales that it can't possibly tilt too far either into or out of either camp leads nowhere that has any real backbone of history The faux epic of a hill as a cultural virility symbol lacks any of the snarl and bite exhibited by the citizens of the Duchy of Burgundy (formerly Pimlico) against the edifice of what was the entire Establishment of the very post-War Britain whose much put-upon subjects were gleefully watching at the time. All we get in the later film is a prettyfied paean to the vapidly New Labour-ish waffle about 'community'. Oh, and a patronising nod in the direction of those funny little people running around Wales like harmless idiots.The final sunsets - SO eye-catching! - are a real damp squib after the truly pathetic fallacy of the storm. The only successful symbolism of the entire film is also pure bathos Balm to the shattered mind of the shellshocked character (actually called 'Shellshocked' by the unfeeling oafs whom he lives amongst!) who has an epiphany when surrounded by thunder and lightning, mud and rain. Was this what the film was building up to? Thank God the National Health Service wasn't around in those days to pick up the cost of such eccentric treatment. The entire epic exercise of building an extension to the hill is, indeed, clearly no more than a form of therapy - much like obsessive D.I.Y in suburbia, or indeed this entire bodged film. I hope the director gets out more, now.The only presence that ever threatens to ignite the film is Kenneth Griffiths as the minister. Unfortunately, any flammable material is kept safely out of his way in this utterly bland rehearsal of film formulae and cultural stereotypes that one had hoped were buried this forty years and more.This is a film that has no more imaginative pressure or intellectual integrity than Tara Fitzgerald's insultingly careless custody of a Welsh guise she visibly and audibly resents in every single scene in which she appears. Her accent is as great an insult to Wales as Hugh Grant's entire twittish persona is an insult to England. Mind you, I can't say I really blame the actress for so obviously regretting her involvement with such a crowd of mentally defective buffoons as are here on display This class of broad mummery, allowed to cavort about as if it were a portrait of the National characteristics of an entire race, would be an immediate scandal in most other ethnic contexts!The final insult is to have duped the contemporary locals, from the area in which the film is set, into lending their presence as a clincher of authenticity to this thoroughly bogus enterprise.I can assure anyone who cares to consider the matter that modern Welsh people who understand what they are about had far rather be totally ignored by the English media, than made into the sort of ridiculous clowns who could only be patronized by persons of a colonialist temperament, whose brains are also evidently not often at home. The token English nutter represented by Hugh Grant in no way balances this racial slur, as he is so self-effacing as to be meaningless as a character. His far more interesting and rebarbative old colonial superior is rapidly put out of the plot's way by the expedient of copious supplies of alcohol. Furthermore, the final engagement of the leading couple is deliberately rendered sterile by an overdose of twee sentimentality precisely in order to avoid raising any real engagement on anyone's part with anything that might have to do with the real world.One cannot forgive the Americans in 'How green is my valley' for portraying Wales as La-La Land, where impromptu male-voice choirs in black-face serenade the aerial pits that stand tip-toe upon the summits of the hills, whilst their women are forever mining butter for scones and scrubbing their menfolk in baths of tea in a lilting but sober corner of California which is forever a sort of Calvinist Ireland with chapel hellfire instead of IRA guns - and still less can one forgive our closest neighbours for creating the kind of sub-Hollywood Kansas dream-world which greets our incredulous gaze in 'Englishman ...'. Here is a theme-park, set aside for the escapist, immature amusement of an England which is incapable of realising Wales as an identifiable place. The plot is at once derivative of Ross and Somerville's 19th century Irish model of a ruling class harmlessly subverted by amusing native tricks, and yet it is obviously much less familiar with its own originals of the amusing types on display, than the earlier work, which does at least retain the imprint of some recognizable world of real experience.But this film is total fantasy, unrelated to anything. Who in hell wants to see these grotesque caricatures attempting to ingratiate themselves with their feudal masters by childishly attempting to increase the status, in the eyes of English officialdom, of an insignificant local landmark? No real Welsh person would grovel to a mere Sais for leave to remain in occupation of their own cultural landscape! See Brian Friel's play 'Translations' for a really witty demolition of the historical impositions of English officialdom on the people of an occupied country.Hugh Grant goes up this mountain of a mole-hill as a twit of an Englishman, and, when he is only half-way-up, it is quite clear that he will come down as exactly the same twit he was before. It is at this point in the clot - sorry, plot - that we lose all interest in the further accumulation of cloddishness, and all further desire to scale the heights of its pretensiousness. The signature-shot of this film is, indeed, a worm's-eye view of a mole-hill. It is a shot that injects a brief and unexpected note of subversive irony into an otherwise self-important folly. Is it an unguarded or a guilty confession by the director? Certainly, the whole project could easily have been buried under such a meadow-pimple - or under worse. Perhaps it should have been.But my considered advice to all English rose-growers would be to avoid like the plague the flatulent produce of this pantomime cow of a film, which is definitely guaranteed not put your national flower into good odour.Simply The film stinks.

I apologise to anyone I've offended with that comment, but it is literally the most boring film ever. I had to endure this utter garbage right in front of me on a plane flight, with no way of turning it off. The plot consists of little more than a bunch of people dumping some earth on top of a hill, whilst keeping the surveyor busy long enough to turn it into a mountain. Not my idea of a fascinating plot. If you want to see something more interesting than this film, paint a wall and watch it dry. For a start, paint can act human far more convincingly than Hugh Grant.  "}]
