However, even without knowing anything about the characters or story lines, I found that I enjoyed this movie a lot, and will probably now start watching the shows reruns. The movie starts off tens of thousands of years in the past, where an alien life form is roaming in underground caves. Fast forward to the present, and that same life form is unearthed by some kids in Texas. No one knows what killed this boy, and the firemen sent down to save him. Or maybe, someone does know. Enter Special Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). A seemlingly unconnected terrorist bombing is linked with the mysterious deaths in Texas, and lead Mulder and Scully all over the world to figure out this global conspiracy. Who knows about this alien life form? And why are they trying so hard to keep it a secret?From what I've been told, a lot of the regulars on the TV show make an appearance in the movie. But as I said earlier, even without knowing who these people are, the movie itself is good enough to stand on its own. What I found I liked the most, and the reason I'll start watching the show, is the interaction between Duchovny and Anderson. After 5 years together, these two work perfectly as a team. They know each other so well; you feel the chemistry and tension between them. The supporting cast was strong, and I liked the idea that an entire alien race is being hidden from the world by a bunch of old white men. The story itself, while again from what I hear doesn't really conclude any plot points from the show, nor start any new ones, manages to stand by itself. The scenery was terrific, especially the opening sequence in the underground caves.   What I was disappointed with was it seemed as if Duchovny was in the movie a lot more than Anderson. It was as if he was the star of the film, and she was a supporting member. The story seemed to revolve around him, and she was there to play off of. I wish that Chris Carter (the series writer and creator, and screenwriter for this film) would have made her more of an equal. The other problem I had was that while the plot was good, at times it wasn't explained as much as it could have been. The reason for the cover-up wasn't made as clear as it could have been, at least in my mind.Whether you're a fan or not, The X-Files Fight the Future is a good way to spend a couple hours in a nice air conditioned environment.

David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson seem out of place working with bomb squads and doing other mundane duties after their department is shut down by the government. However the two feel that something really major is up which involves alien colonization on Earth and a vast government cover-up that goes through the highest places in the U.S. political realm. A good screenplay and solid direction make The X-Files a first-rate film from a very good cinematic year. 4 stars out of 5.

On repeat viewings, however, the story is revealed to be thin, and lacking in incident. Its need to tie into events of the series makes it not wholly satisfying as a stand-alone vehicle, though it should still be understandable to those that have never seen an episode.David Duchovny as Mulder seems surprisingly at ease in his limited way, while Martin Landau is good as far as plot devices go. Gillian Anderson is unfortunately encouraged to overstate her lines, particularly in the beginning, while a cameo by The Lone Gunmen is perhaps the only indulgence that would be lost on non-fans.There are inevitable concessions to the cinema format, of course. Not the touted mild use of expletives, which happened from time to time on TV anyway. But the alien presence that mutates to owe a debt to Ridley Scott's Alien, or the near-kiss between the two leads. Thankfully, the first point actually makes a logical sense and carries the story forward. The second is something that was also long overdue, and silly that it took so long. For two people who obviously feel about each other the way Mulder and Scully do, to go five years without even kissing is stretching credulity.Ultimately, though, it lacks any clear focus for a casual film audience, and flits repetitively from action sequence to sloppy exposition and back again throughout its duration. Creator Chris Carter, like Gene Roddenberry with Star Trek before him, is not the smoothest writer of his own series, though he does adequately most of the time. Worst example is the opening Mulder/Scully scene which is laughably trite, and there are plenty more examples of Carter's trademark purple prose. Yet it does have a beginning, middle and end, and can be watched back-to-back with a TV episode with no noticeable jumps in style. In that sense, then, it is a most successful big-screen adaptation of a television series.Hard-core X-File fans will be inclined to award an extra mark to the total, then. But for a non-committal audience, this is a 6 as they would have no idea from watching this that the frail, fag-smoking pensioner is the series' major villain.

I, like many other critics who walked into The X-Files movie, fall into the latter category. But it doesn't matter, because I don't believe that there are any real twists in the plot or revelations like the extended title implies there may be. In fact, I think that even the strict fans of the television show may be a bit in the dark by the time the credits start to roll. I got lost about 2/3 of the way through, but I still had a fun time.Scully and Mulder, the two FBI Agents (I think) from the famous television show of the same name, make their big-screen debut in a feature-length, theatrical film release that plays much more like a clever science fiction film than a stupid one. I do not claim to be a huge fan of the science-fiction genre -- I like softer sci-fi such as The Terminator -- but I admire the hard sci-fi films that make an effort to reach those of us who many not be the most enthusastic sci-fi geeks. The X-Files has a harder task -- it has to reach those who not only have never seen the show, but also those who may not love sci-fi too much, and it does a good job. I admire it above all else for being able to do this.It strikes a chord that good sci-fi films have struck in the past. It gets down to the meaty bits, although sometimes the plot left me in the dark and the ending started to get a bit crazy, which lowered my overall pleasure regarding the film. It's like a mystery set in the world of UFOs and alien encounters. It is, at times, quite chilling in a subtle way, and at other times quite humorous and fun and thrilling.It starts off with a boy falling into a pit and being attacked by hundreds of small, slug-like creatures that crawl into his eye sockets and over his eyes (don't bring the kids to this one). More people enter into the pit in an ill-fated attempt to rescue the boy, and they wind up being knocked unconscious (or put into a deep sleep) like the boy. The bodies are all transported to a hospital, and that same hospital later blows up after Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Mulder (David Duchovny) are unable to stop an implanted terrorist bomb from detonating inside a coke maching.But then Mulder is told by a mysterious man outside a bar (Martin Landau) that the bomb was never attempted to be defused. It was all an elaborate cover-up to hide the bodies of the pit victims. Mulder shrugs off the old man at first before he realizes that the man used to be a friend of his father's, and that he has some interesting true stories to tell.The X-Files intrigued me, kept me interested for the most part, and gave me a few good chill sequences, and yet I haven't seen a single full-length episode of the FOX TV show (only little tidbits here and there). From what I can tell from my short experiences with the television show, this film carries a much more mainstream feel to it. I don't really take an interest in TV shows because I find them pretty corny. But The X-Files movie wasn't that corny.The sight of the aliens themselves is only touched lightly, and the secret promised to be revealed by the trailers and ads isn't. (I assume most people thought it would be in regards to Mulder's alien-abducted sister from his childhood.) But Duchovny is very interesting and often humorous in his role, and I would like to see him in more films than he is in. Gillian Anderson is a bit weak in her role -- in fact, my mother saw her on stage in London and reported back to me that she was so bored by her dull, lifeless performance that she nearly left the theater. But Duchovny carries along the film by himself, and the film has some good sequences. Overall, even people who have never laid eyes on the TV show will be able to appreciate this.3.5/5 stars.- John Ulmer "},{"Title":"Absolutely the best gift C.Carter and his crew could have given to us, the fans","Date":"14 August 1998","Score":"34 out of 52 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi","Review":"  The first time I saw this film I was expecting something less than  spectacular because of the mixed reviews I had read before going.

When I first watched and rated this movie, I gave it a perfect 10 for it being an exciting, fast-paced story of characters I've come to know and love. It still is all that. But putting the movie in context with the series, evaluating it as an episode between the seasons, forces me to acknowledge the flaws that it contains. As I've already mentioned, this is an exciting, fast-paced story; bigger than any mythology episode before it, as it is essentially a two-hour mythology episode. Rob Bowman, my favorite X-Files director does an awesome job. Getting chased by black helicopters at night through a cornfield and escaping from homicidal aliens in an enormous alien spaceship are things the series could never dreamed of doing with a television series budget. The drama, dialogue and action are great. Martin Landau does a wonderful job as Kurtzweil, Mulder's informant for the movie. I love the scene transitions in the movie. A lot of them are done in a creative way that informs as well as entertains. What brings the movie down a couple of points are some inconsistencies like Scully not getting caught in the autopsy room, the patient bee that can stay underneath Scully's collar all the way from a cornfield in Texas to Mulder's apartment in D.C., many hours later. And, of course, the bad guys that somehow know that Scully is going to be stung by the bad bee and have an ambulance and false EMT guys at the ready, and intercept Mulder's 911. Even in the X-Files, that whole sequence with the bee sting was too far-fetched to be believable. An interesting thing learned from the audio commentary is that Chris Carter wanted to give the fans a kiss between Mulder and Scully but not a real kiss. So he considers the near-kiss in the hallway plus Mulder doing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on Scully to equal a kiss between the two. Odd thinking methinks. The X-Files movie is not a letdown and a definite thrill ride for fans of the show. Just a few unbelievable plot inconsistencies makes it not the best that the X-Files has to offer.

The X-Files had so many different fans, I have to admit that I was a fan, not so much to the extent as many others were, but I enjoyed the show. However, I think because my friend rubbed it in my face so much of how much this show was the best television show to ever hit the air waves, I steered clear of the movie. But I was renting movies the other day and came across The X-Files, and figured to just give the movie a shot, it's been how many years since the show ended? But I watched it last night and I liked the movie. I think the only thing is, is this was a movie that was definitely made for the fans and no one else, because if you didn't watch the show, you won't get into the movie.Mulder and Scully are on the case again after they learn of a deadly virus that is killing off the planet. Of course the government is covering it up, making it seem like it's more of a terrorist or a horrible flu. Mulder wants to make the truth known, but Scully has just given up, that is until she is attacked by a bug carrying the virus and Mulder will not give up on her. He saves her, but she needs more strength if they are to make it out of this situation alive.The X-Files the movie is a cool sci fi film, if you are not a fan or didn't watch the series, there is a small chance you'll get into the film. But this was a definite treat for the fans, this is the film they wanted and as much as I hate this saying, The X-Files is just an extended episode with a bigger budget, but it's still a cool film. I liked it, Mulder and Scully always provide perfect entertainment and I just love Mulder going into his infamous speeches of the truth is out there, so over dramatic, but you gotta love his passion in it.

I'm sick of it happening again, I don't want to do this any more. I felt like applauding at that point.For me that speech was not only this film but the whole concept of the X-files in a nutshell.Nothing of any real consequence occurs in this film, nothing at all. It's simply two FBI agents occasionally being chased, or chasing someone, or looking puzzled. They sometimes find physical evidence of a government conspiracy to do something terrible, but the evidence is without exception snatched away or destroyed (or forgotten by the writers). Sometimes we might even see the conspirators talking about these forthcoming terrible events in very vague terms. The terrible events never, ever happened in the series. However, I was hopeful that with a cinema budget they might stretch to showing an alien invasion or two. Perhaps the writers had only been teasing the audience until they had the money to give their intended cataclysm justice on the big screen. Alas, all we get is an exploding building (destroying evidence), an exploding car (destroying evidence) and some snow falling into an empty hole. Nothing you wouldn't find in a TV Movie.The dialogue is awful too, Mulder is continuously told that he's barely scratched the surface of the conspiracy. I'd wager a good amount of money that he's actually gone right through the surface a long time ago and exhausted all the plot we're ever going to get out of Chris Carter. When we find out what this conspiracy involves, it's actually a very very dull mix of Alien and V, about extraterrestrials conquering the earth with the help of ambitious humans with a view to feeding on human bodies. Doctor Who also used this plot several times over in the 60s and 70s.In the X-Files, essentially, nothing happens, to the characters, to their status or their plans, and for the worst of reasons, because the producers want to string this franchise out for as long as they can make money from it. The aliens will never invade, but neither will Mulder ever prove to anyone that they exist, I can tell you that right now. I can also tell you that if all this *is* ever resolved in a final film or episode, it will turn out to be a disappointing cop-out.One of the other reviewers on IMDB compared the X-Files film to Hitchcock, but Hitchcock actually satisfied his audience by showing the little guy cleverly fighting back and eventually triumphing over the dark conspiracy against him. There was methodical progression, there was movement, there was excitement, tension and engagement. Hitchcock films are thrilling because you believe the hero might win or the villain might kill him. You know the conclusion is just round the corner, whatever happens.In the X-Files we *know* that Mulder will never be killed (the evil conspirators say they will not kill him for fear of making him a martyr). Unfortunately, we also *know* that Mulder will never win, because then they couldn't make a sequel to this single-issue drama. There is no thrill in the X-Files because the basic premise of the film (and indeed series), its ground rules, demand that ultimately nothing happens for the sake of extending the franchise. It's just aimless wandering.Sorry to be crude, but the X-Files is like perpetual Coitus Interruptus.The only vaguely memorable scene is Martin Landau p***ing in an alley.

A laughable cult to be derided like The Invaders, Land of the Giants or, indeed, Lost In Space. Wrong. It has matured into the most revered SF phenomenon since Star Trek and as those champions of hair, ZZ Top, once proclaimed it's 'got legs'.Forsaking opening credits or a slow build-up, director Rob Bowman propels us on to a roller-coaster ride of moderately daft spooky shenanigans and grand effects. All the same elements from the TV series are here, shadowy high-ranking figures controlling the planet - These people have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon, plenty of furtive glances and hellish beasties from the dawn of time. Plus we have the two small box giants, Mulder (David 'Mondeo Man' Duchovny) and Scully (Gillian 'the FHM pin-up' Anderson), coming across marvellously well on the big screen.In fact, for a show which thrives on a claustrophobic feel, this wide-screen treatment is cleverly handled. Bowman arms his two leads with a witty, edgy script, and pits them against the pervading evil through a combination of Aliens, James Bond and Alfred Hitchcock action sequences.Ultimately, The X-Files is very entertaining and thankfully devoid of any product placing or blessed meteors.

Ordered out by the agent in charge, the bomb explodes destroying much of the building and killing 4 people.  Without any suspects, the authorities look for someone to blame and focus on Mulder.  To clear himself Mulder investigates a tip from Alvin Kurtzweil that the bomb was to cover the fact that 3 of those killed were already dead.  Investigating, Scully discovers evidence that points to a viral infection by aliens, orchestrated by a group of powerful men.Although I had stopped watching series long before it finally ended I still wanted to see this film.  The basic plot is the element I've always preferred in the series &#150; the bigger picture of the alien conspiracy, as opposed to the one-episode wonder of freaks or monsters etc.  The film gets off to a great start &#150; the early scene where a man calmly waits for the bomb 2 feet in front of him to explode to destroy the alien evidence is creepy and tells the audience immediately just how important the contents of the building are.  After this point it keeps the momentum fairly well but doesn't manage to ever feel like it's not something we've seen before in the series.This might not be a problem for most people but for those who have issues (or are totally unaware of the series) then it is easy just to see this as part of the series rather than a stand alone movie experience.  That said, it does have elements that show it to be of a grander scale and it does fill out the screen quite well.  The best thing it does is manage to have a constant uneasy feeling over the lengths that the conspiracy will go to &#150; whether it's the bombing or the sealing of a scientist in a tomb, it all feels scary.  The downside of this is that the film can't capitalise on this as really this feeling works best as part of an ongoing series than just a film which requires an ending.There are a few funny moments (Mulder taking a leak on ID4 is the best) but the film does keep the drama up quite well.  In terms of performances, Duchovny can do this stuff in his sleep and at least is open to a little mocking of Mulder in his performance.  Anderson seems to have been a little short changed and is treated as a secondary character &#150; she spends a lot of the film shouting gruff instructions `don't think, just pick up the phone and make it happen' etc.  Support from the usual X Files characters are all good although with some of them you do wonder why they bothered for all the screen time they had.Overall this film will be liked by fans and should do the job for those (like me) who take a passing interest in the series.  As a film it is not perfect and is perhaps a little too familiar for my tastes, but seen as a big screen episode of the series it works just fine.

But the hype around it was so excruciating at the time this film came out that I thought, What the hell, I'll have to give it another go. And I thought the best place to start would be the film, which was being released amid much hoopla. I thought that it would be better than any episode; that, given the stretched budget and running time of a movie, the makers would be able to come up with a more developed and intriguing plot than the contrived, formulaic ones often found in TV shows; and if I liked it, I could take it from there.Well, the result was bitter disappointment. The movie demanded an extensive knowledge of previous data, places, characters and events, in order to be fully understood, and, even with the blanks filled in, no amount of spectacular visuals could make up for the paper-thin plot. I suppose that some of the most notorious scenes of the film (no need to mention, you know which ones) were big payoffs for fans, but the sad truth was that this was just an extended episode, i.e. it did not stand alone on its own two feet as a film and it should have never reached the big screen, just aired as a special. I believe that, even if a film is based on previous material, it should always be a self contained story that can be enjoyed, at least for the most part, also by the uninitiated, but this is clearly not the case here.So, I can't really judge the significance of this film for those who love the show (and I know there's a lot out there, so fair enough if they're satisfied, this movie was clearly just for them).

The script is also problematic for other reasons, not that Chris Carter was ever the most talented X-Files writer in terms of dialogue (see Vince Gilligan or Darin Morgan) but some of this movie seems extraordinarily cheap and speed-written (Carter essentially had to write this film and his season 5 episodes roughly at the same time), and the result is some really embarrassing moments.The whole movie has a sort of 'greatest hits' feel, cramming the Lone Gunmen in just for the sake of having them there, revisiting questions but not answering them, and bringing back stuff we remember from mythology episodes just for the fun of it. This was the first step into REALLY muddling the mythology arc the series became famous for, although I for one thought season 6 was exceptionally strong, but the show's mytharc dwindled fast in quality and by seasons 7 and 9 it was the standalone episodes that remained memorable and entertaining.To its credit, this film is well-made and excellently scored, and the acting is generally solid. There are good parts here and there but mostly it feels like a sellout. The mythology arc was seriously harmed by this film and there's no telling if it would've played out better without it.

And the Bees, somewhere in the first 5 seasons of The X-Files, Bees came into the equation. But what do Bees have to do with The Black Oil? That's what this film is about.But Mulder pushed too far and too hard, he took a huge gamble and lost - Lost The X-Files, literally, Cancerman burned them, and the entire X- Files department was shut down, Mulder and Skully relegated to Butt tasks.

And we get to see the scope of The Alien Conspiracy like it had never been shown in the Television Series, because it simply could not fit on a TV screen.And as usual, Mulder gets to see the full extant of the Conspiracy, while Skully's head is turned the other way But she had just been thawed out from a huge Spaceship, and Mulder had to do CPR on her at least once. So it's just par for the X Files course, Skully never sees what Mulder sees In the whole series, and two movies, Skully has never seen the incredible stuff Mulder has seen.The Black Oil makes one out-of-X-Files appearance In Fringe, Season 2, Episode 13 What Lies Below - This is in fact, the exact same Black Oil as is shown in this movie and in The X Files series.

It's vulgarized.  I'm not a big fan of the original TV series, although I suppose over time I've seen most of the available episodes.  Some of them are pretty dull.  But the writers as a collective whole had respect for the real fans.  The plots are often hard to follow and sometimes don't make sense but the real interest in any case was in the relationship between Mulder and Scully, as well as between the two of them and the mystery they were trying to unravel.  It was all very subdued.  Lots of dark rooms with flashlight beams waving around.  A bit of f/x with bumps running around under someone's skin but not much of that.  And, most endearing, a good deal of low-key humor.  But because not much is made of the comedy you have to watch carefully for it.  In one episode, Mulder confronts a self-proclaimed mind reader, thrusts his head forward, and says, Read this thought.  The mind-reader raises his eyebrows and snaps back, So's your old man.  The exchange is over in a few seconds.  All of the humor was rather like that.  And it's missing in this movie, which takes itself much too seriously and tries to make up for these kinds of crabwise quotidian exchanges by an expanded scale.  A building in the movie blows up in tremendous fireballs.  Cars actually -- can you believe this? -- smash into one another when they crash.  Special effects abound in a way they didn't in the series, overcoming the mind, boggling it with their monstrousness, a huge space ship, a hole in the ice!The plot is as silly as any of the sillier ones in the series.  A government conspiracy revolving around a virus that was stored by the original aliens who inhabited the earth -- am I getting this right? -- and it winds up with Mulder stalking across the infinite expanse of antarctic snow and happening to fall into the only available hidden three-foot-wide hole that leads down through three or four layers until he finds himself lying exhausted at the bottom of a thirty foot chute in the ice.  Does he try to get out?  Not on your life, or on his either.  He digs deeper, which only makes sense, as long as you're trying to come out in China so your can order General Tsao's chicken in General Tsao's Original Chinese Restaurant.The acting.  Dealing with Gillian Anderson first.  She has a skewed kind of beauty, her face from certain angles resembling a Renaissance sculpture, and from others an ordinarily beautiful Hausfrau.  I find myself wondering what her molars look like.  Her figure is odd as well, no neck to speak of, and a muscularity that bespeaks Bronco Nagurski.  I don't mean that to sound worse than it does.  She's an extremely attractive woman.  Love that nose, which reminds me of an overhanging ledge I once took a photo of in the Blue Ridge Mountains.  Her acting is adequate, both here and in the series, but it's impossible to tell what sort of legs her career will have because her range is necessarily so constricted.  David Duchovny, I am assured by multiple sources, is a big hearthrob.  His face has been described as panty melting.  Okay -- I don't hold that against him, despite my jealousy.  He seems like a nice guy.  I'd like to play poker with him.  But, as in Anderson's case, the role restricts him.  I can't tell whether he's an actor or not.  I've never seen either of them in anything except their series.I genuinely believe that fans of the series might as well stick with the series.  A few miles of rough road now and then, but it's a superior TV entity.  This movie is not much more than exploitation of the fans' interest.

For seven years they were the centerpiece of what is likely to be remembered as the show of the 90's.  Drama, comedy, they did it all well and different.  Season 8 and 9 are not in that league due to the reduced presence of Duchovny and Anderson and a burned out core writing staff, but it was still better than most of its rivals.  The movie essentially can serve as a cliffnote to the first five years, although I highly recommend buying the season box sets and start from the beginning.  For the film itself, keep in mind that the X-Files in the end was about the journey of Mulder and Scully to each other and not really about conspiracies or aliens.

If you like the series, you will probably like this film. Although I consider the TV show to be somewhat ridiculous, I enjoyed its plot-orientation, classy production, often sophisticated writing, and the relationship between the protagonists - Mulder and Scully. The film gives its audience more of the same, but elaborates nicely on Scully and Mulder, and amplifies the production values by an order of magnitude.Despite the somewhat convoluted mode of presentation, the story is pretty simple. Mulder and Scully have uncovered a cover-up involving a deadly extra-terrestrial virus, which is a precursor to a much bigger problem presided over by the mysterious secret uber-government the show so often hints at. A lot of questions are answered less ambiguously than the series normally offered, and a few new ones surface before the lengthy, action-oriented climax. Duchovny plays Mulder exactly as he did on TV, but Gillian Anderson adds impressive depth to Scully. Martin Landau gives a nice supporting performance as Mulder's questionable informant. The directing is a touch above the TV show's standards, as is the cinematography. And the special effects are much better than what XF fans are used to. Too bad they didn't have Angelo Badalamenti for the soundtrack. The story does one difficult thing very well - it fits within a long story-arc from the TV show quite nicely and yet manages to operate decently as a stand-alone story as well. Despite this the film is even more absurd and paranoiac than the TV show. Major suspension of disbelief required, but worth the effort if you like the show, or enjoy wholly fictional conspiracy theory. Had it not followed the standard S-Files TV show formula, X-Files - The Movie, might have earned a 7 instead of a 5 from me.

Hence the ship taking off a few minutes later. With regards to point 2, the FBI most likely have international cellular communications. Not sure how many mobile transmitters there are in the arctic, and although I see your point, it's not a big enough hole to worry about. Such a crater or land implosion would have notified a local meteorological site on their seismic detectors. I'm pretty sure someone would check it out pretty quickly on a satellite feed.Now onto my views, I thought it was a very good film as far as X-Files is concerned. It takes a while to get into it, but hits the whole theme of 'V' with the secret infiltration and colonisation of the planet earth. I love this idea, even if it is removed as it could be happening right now and we would never know it! The special effects are pretty good for the time this was created, there are a few issues in plot such as, when Mulder escapes from the UFO out of a hatch, an alien almost catches him but gets hit by a blast of 'steam'. Another blast of what appears to be 'steam' follows soon after, however during the few minutes they were in the pipe they were lucky enough to avoid such an event.Overall this is an enjoyable film for those who love to think that this world has more than meets the eye. This is television from a 'free' era of society which does not contain any particularly biased political influence or propaganda. 7 / 10 for it's decent acting, decent budget and effects. However this film could have done with being a bit more complex.

I continued to watch the show after the movie, but my interest had wavered by the seventh series.This movie was okay but underwhelming. It just didn't have the scale and scope that a movie should have compared to a television series. Now television has come in leaps and bounds over time. Just look at what they do on '24' each week - every episode is like a mini-movie. And many of the X-File episodes like the 'Duane Barry' trilogy, and 'Anasazi' trilogy were cracking in their pace and drama. But the movie just feels like a glorified television episode. I remember a documentary on the making of the movie, and the cast and crew were excitedly describing the opening of the movie where a bomb goes off in a building. Now everyone involved was understandably chuffed and excited by the new experience, but all filmgoers know that blowing up things are like the meat and potatoes of action movies. It's been done over and over and over.Overall, they were trying to push forward for the hardcore fans but also draw in a wider audience. This holds the movie back in many ways. The plot was a tad too complex and insiderish for the non-fans and they slightly over-estimated the fanbase pleasure at just seeing Mulder, Scully and the Cigarette Man on the big-screen. The big sequences - the bomb, the corn field - were not large enough for the average person. Winking at the fans like Mulder and Scully 'stung kissing' and Scully missing out seeing the paranormal stuff was cute but becoming a bit too much of a tease by this stage. There were no great revelations or twists for anybody. Too much sitting around in smoke-filled rooms and not enough humour.The above is mostly criticism because I was a long-time fan. But it's not a bad film - like I said, just a big TV episode. If you were a fan of the show and for some reason haven't seen it yet, you should give it a whirl. Others could probably give it a miss. They're saying now that the second film will be more of a monster of the week thing than a mythology thing, which shows they may have learnt something. I mean, the mythology eventually became so convoluted with so many questions and almost no answers that I don't think they could make it into an accessible movie if they tried. For the next movie, I assume Chris Carter, Frank Spotnitz, and Rob Bowman will be the likely creative team but all the hardcore fans know that Glen Morgan and James Wong wrote some of the best eps - however they too have fallen off the wagon - 'Final Destination' movies and 'The One.'

I also found it a bit too gory for my tastes. I had always liked the twists and turns of the plot in the TV show and I thought they did an effective job in this movie-I think they really had an impossible task but they pulled it off. I recently saw the first two episodes of the new X-Files TV miniseries. I had some feelings about it. I felt that it didn't seem to reflect that a massive alien conspiracy had been uncovered/proved & dealt with within the confines of the first X-Files movie. The first episode opens with a voice over by Agent Mulder basically saying 'I have never found a shred of proof of the existence of aliens.' In light of the first X-Files movie that would be absolute nonsense. Not only did Agent Mulder find proof of aliens on Earth in the first X-Files movie he came into close physical proximity with actual aliens. That is more than 'evidence' which he claims in the voice over of the first episode of the miniseries he has yet to come by. I can accept a lot from a science fiction/mystery orientated TV show like the X-Files-but a denial of major plot premises of past efforts albeit in a movie isn't one of the things that work for me.

The story isn't as interesting, crazy or scary as many in the series, the pace of the story is much slower (whole film should have been at least 15 minutes shorter), and the banter between the main characters is not as sharp.And since ALL of this is also true of the later I Want to Believe feature film--except even more so-- then the only conclusion I can come to is that Chris Carter should stick to TV. At least as far as X-Files goes. A genius at TV, he just doesn't seem to get what works in movies.I hope they revive the series with Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny in the leads. It would actually make more sense for experienced FBI agents to be in their mid 40s to early 50s, in my opinion. (of course, it helps that Duchovny is still quire handsome and Anderson has gotten even hotter in her mid years). If they do it as a limited series,like House of Cards or American Horror Story, I think it could be a big hit.

The movie is just as good, an exciting addition to the TV show but still understandable for people who haven't yet seen the TV show.Basically, F.B.I. agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully end up caught in a plot of alien colonization, although the X - Files cases have been closed seemingly for good. This alien plan goes all the way to the mysterious Cigarette Smoking Man who has, let's just say, not very nice intentions.It was great to see this movie, the characters were just as good in this as they were in the television show. Canadian actor William B. Davis was excellent as the Cigarette Smoking Man (that character was like my idol as a kid) and the plot is suspenseful.

I've never been more than a casual viewer and, to me, this film represents the best the series had to offer.Everyone knows that creator Chris Carter was inspired by the Night Stalker TV Series when he formulated The X-Files. Whereas that brief 70s series was overt and almost cartoony with it's depictions of the paranormal, The X-Files always took a more subdued, realistic approach. To some, this made it boring; to others, fascinating; to many, a mixture of both.The way the plot in the movie unfolds is similar to Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, albeit more serious and quasi-believable. After an explosion reminiscent of the Oklahoma City bombing, FBI agents Mulder and Scully stumble on an otherworldy virus and an intricate governmental cover-up. Their investigation leads them all over the map and, ultimately, to Antarctica, with numerous mysterious happenings.Other than the paranormal, the appeal of The X-Files has always been Gillian Anderson. What a uniquely beautiful redhead! The film runs two hours and was shot in California, British Columbia, Texas, New Jersey, London and Washington DC.GRADE B+ "},{"Title":"Great Sci-Fi and you don't have to be a Fan of the Series to Enjoy,","Date":"4 March 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi","Review":" The X-Files is a great movie with a well developed storyline with a talented cast.I have never seen a single episode of the television series and decided to watch this movie when I saw that it was on TV,I was afraid that I wouldn't set a lot of it since I haven't watched the series,but it was clearly written so people who don't watch the series could still understand what was going on.The two main actors,Derek Duchovney and Gillian Anderson,are the best part of this movie,they both suit their characters extremely well and you can tell with the on screen chemistry that they were use to working with each other from the series.I think fans of the series will probably still enjoy it very much,but people who haven't seen the X-Files can still definitely watch the movie,and I would recommend as a good sci-fi and mystery.Mulder and Scully get caught up in a worldwide conspiracy that could change the future of mankind. "},{"Title":"An over long episode of the X-files","Date":"28 December 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi","Review":" Probably one one the most hyped and advertised movies this years. I will also say anticipated but that is getting way to clichéd, and I am here to be critical rather than a form of free advertising. Anyway, this movie has been described as a very good X-files episode. My opinion is that it wraps up the four seasons of the X-files. The mystery has been revealed and we know what is going on. It is a decent movie on its own, but it fills in a lot of gaps that have been left open in many of the important episodes. It continues on from episodes such as Tunguska and explains the real intention of the aliens. In some cases we wonder if Chris Carter had a plan in mind as he put the episodes together (such as John Michael Strazinsky with Babylon 5) but it seems that with this movie, there was an idea that was tying all, or a lot, of the episodes together.The problem with such a movie is knowing what to give out. The advertisements talk of a bomb going off in Dallas which covers up a number of dead bodies which were pulled out of the ground, one of them being a rednecked kid. What we do have is an alien that was lying dormant in the ground for millions of years and it was unearthed by some rednecked kids on the outskirts of a Texan city. Within minutes FEMA is there covering it up and the smoking man is running the show.That is an interesting thing about the smoking man. He is not as powerful as we expect him to be. On one hand he seems to be the guy that is behind everything but there is a secret organisation that are pulling his strings. The smoking man is really an operative that has more powers than the President of the United States. In fact he has the authority to assassinate the president if the president looks like he is going to undermine their plans, and the plans are broad reaching.I don't want to give too much away because the whole point of the movie is the mystery. Once the mystery has been revealed then there is nothing of interest left. I watched the X-files for the big mystery and was a little board with the episodes that did not raise more questions about what was really going on. We know that there are aliens around and we know that Mulder's father was involved in it. We also know that there have been medical experiments on many people and recently we found out that people were being exterminated because of these experiments. Most importantly the Black Cancer that is the major focus of Tunguska, is heavily involved.The X-files continues the theme of the distrust of the government and the hatred of the central authority. In these episodes it has always been the government that has been attacked for its secrets and conspiracies. There is the running idea that the government is not to be trusted and the truth is being hidden from us. We are living a life that is terminally destructive and the government knows why. Others claim that humanity is too flawed for a government to be so powerful. A statement they are men that don't make mistakes is quoted but everybody makes mistakes. The truer statement is one is the loneliest number and that, to me, is the truth.

As with any great success, The X Files felt the time had come for it to branch out to mainstream film. Unfortunately, those expectations were not as anticipated enthusiastically as might have been expected. Why? Well, this movie follows the TV show very closely in terms of plot, character motivation, and even ups the ante in budget and special effects. The big problem I feel must have been that a more general audience would not or did not want to follow along with the investigative zeal of FBI agents Mulder and Scully for evidence of aliens on our planet and of a government conspiracy to hide that fact. The script does make allowances for those that might not follow the show, and everything is explained simply enough. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson do their standard best in the lead roles, and the supporting cast is quite good with John Neville, a wonderful William Davis, Martin Landau, and the always underrated Mitch Pileggi excelling. Had this movie been more successful, Chris Carter and crew might have been able to move the X files from the small screen to the big screen permanently - but that was not to be. Although I have only recently become an X File addict, I did see the movie - not really understanding all that much but liking it nonetheless - before I saw one single episode. After seeing all nine seasons, the movie really pales in comparison to most mythology shows. I don't know why. Maybe the expectations were just too high that a movie would be so much more. For me the movie is very good but a glitzier, more polished episode - nothing more. For those following the series season by season, you really need to see the movie chronologically with the series. It explains some things to be later developed in the show and even explains the disappearance of a character I always found very interesting.

It did not disappoint; the new LA locations looked great (still missed BC though), the special effects were amazing, and that third act was just crazy. One of the best things about the film was that it actually furthered the plot, rather than just rehash the story up to that point.However, I'm not sure how accessible this film is to new viewers. I had spoken with several people who had seen this film with no prior X-Files experience; several were confused and turned off, while others became interested in the show as a result. The plot advances at a quick pace, so I can understand why some people wouldn't get into it--the film really does kind of expect you to have at least some knowledge of who the characters are.Overall though this is a solid film. It's a must watch for fans of the series, and would be a good place to start for those who haven't seen it before.

In fact, as alluded to on the DVDs extra features, one could drop in on this version (never having seen the TV show) and still find plenty to whet their appetite.Mulder and Scully soon find themselves facing the wrath of the FBI...again. They're blamed for something that's clearly not their fault, but as AD Skinner tells them, the FBI looked bad because of the explosion and someone has to pay. Mulder's renegade reputation makes him an easy target and because of Scully's closeness she, too, it is clear, will pay the price. Mulder, however, meets a man who tells him things that only fuel the fire within him. The plot thickens from there.True to the TV show, the movie version has the kinds of twists, turns, and surprises that true X-Philes can enjoy. There are also revelations that confirm what many Philes have suspected. Humans, in their attempt to appease earth's first inhabitants have gone along with a program that, it becomes apparent, will seal their doom. The Syndicate was organized to cope with the aliens and their plans and thence an alliance was formed with the aliens to save humankind...at any cost. I could go on, but why spoil the plot line...? Some may find fault with this movie. But then there are those who would find fault with The Godfather, Gone With The Wind and so on. I'm not trying to equate the X-Files movie with either of those or any other great movies...I'm only saying that fault can be found with virtually any cinematic endeavor.The X-Files movie, like the TV show, is entertainment. The X-Files is one of the most cerebral television shows to come down the pike in many years. It's a show that will make you think. The characters, stories and bizarre happenings are meant to keep one guessing. And Chris Carter has done an admirable job in this movie. The X-Files didn't become a worldwide phenomenon by drivel and gauzy plots. This movie will fit well in one's X-Files collection and fill in some blanks, but not all of them. The movie is true to Carter's vision of what the X-Files is all about.X-Philes should enjoy this and look forward to the next installment on the big screen.

The show, which here is transferred into big-budget Hollywood form for the big-screens, has a good lot of its credit in due to its main characters, Mulder and Scully (David Duchovney and Gillian Anderson), who are of course professional, more often than not slightly paranoid, and occasionally amusing in their straight-forward way. That they have a good connection as actors and play off each other like its second nature goes a long way to help make many of the strange oddities and sometimes more off-beat stories seem fairly credible. It's basically like the Silence of the Lambs as a TV show, only substituting the disturbing gore and violence for stories somewhere in the Twilight Zone area. In short, pulp entertainment with an intelligent twist.If the movie may not match up to the best episodes, or if it does depending on how much or how little you watch the show (it could go either way, and I speak as a little more than a casual viewer), it might be due to the grander scope given to the story, how ideas and character traits maybe are taken a little over the edge here. It may not be much of a spoiler to say here that, yes, you do see aliens, and other interesting, if not 100% successful, suspense sequences. It's also one of the most 'wordy' of the late 1990's sci-fi summer blockbusters. A problem though in maybe not knowing enough, or likewise knowing too much, are that the supporting characters are not given enough background. That much has to be explained in the film for non-fans that has already been explained on the show ties up certain things in the story as well.But certain gripes aside, the X-Files film, even during some scenes with some weak dialog, does provide a story that is involving, and doesn't coattail to the Independence Day crowd. Mulder and Scully this time are on the trail of a mystery following a mysterious hole is un-earthed in North Texas, meanwhile as a building explodes in Dallas. Certain evidence leads the two into a cover-up involving a virus, entailing a huge room full of bees, a run through a corn-field, and finally a trip to the frozen tundra for an amazing discovery. If some of this already sounds routine, it really isn't a lot of time. Martin Landau, for example, has a good, small role as an undercover author who meets up with Mulder, giving little points of Governmental paranoia. The scenes inside the 'Dallas' building combine the tense prospects of a Hollywood action scene and some cleverness behind it. Only the climax in the tundra, ironically, is no too satisfying.Apparently, the film is connected in-between two of the seasons of the X-Files that were running at the time. Would it be better to see those last episodes of the season before and first of the season after for guidance? Is this really just a big-studio pumped TV movie? I'm not sure to either one (maybe more of a yes to the second one). But I didn't feel too cheated, unlike other blockbusters of the time.

There are always something happening. You already know the character and that allows you to cut right to the chase without any introductions. The characters are good and just the way you want them. There are some interesting interaction between Mulder and Scully and the other characters interact nice as well.The cinematography is really nice. It's classic X-File just much better. The lightening is good and the composition is just great. It's really cool and enjoyable to look at. The mood and the characters are captured very well. The sets, decoration and costumes are also good. The film has much the same over all look as the series.Duchovny and Anderson knows their characters and deliver a good and believable act. Many of the others are also regulars from the series, but not all.

It's a great mood-builder and brings out the action and feeling very well.Fight The Future is bigger, longer, more tense and thrilling, more filled with action and better than any episode of the series I've seen so far. It's definitely a film worthy of a great series. If you're an X-Files fan you have, of course, seen this movie. If you haven't, it's time you do.

I had never seen The X-Files before, but after seeing the movie I was hooked. Being able to enjoy the movie without knowing anything about the show was an accomplishment by the creator.Many critics downed the movie saying it was to confusing to understand. I felt the story made sense without being too unbelievable or outrageous. It blended the right amount of intelligence, drama, fiction, action, and conspiracy to stay interesting.Many other honorable mentions are Rob Bowman and his directing. He pays great detail to color and setting. Mark Snows score kept the tone of the movie very atmospheric. And finally the special effects should have been Oscar nominated, they created several different places to see and things to look at. The X-Files movie stands alone as a great science fiction film.

Everything from Star Trek to Josie and the Pussycats  absolutely sucks!  There is one exception, though.  The X-Files.  This movie totally rocked!  The film came out at the height of the show's popularity and linked the very successful fifth and sixth seasons.  This is the only box office smash that David Duchovny has ever been a part of and it will be the only box office smash that he will ever be a part of, but that's beside the point.  The X-Files is a non-stop thrill ride that will leave you on the edge of your seat.  (I came up with that all by myself)  Duchovny, Gillian Anderson, and Chris Carter were able to translate their television success into a $187 million box office powerhouse, and the film lived up to the enormous hype bestowed upon it by the show's hardcore fans and critics alike.  If you've ever seen The X-Files television series, then you've seen this film, and you were not disappointed.  If you have not seen it, I suggest you throw away your 29 cent Lost In Space DVD and head straight to your local Blockbuster or Hollywood Video store and rent it.The X-Files is everything you could ask for in a sci-fi drama/action flick.

It rewards regular viewers and entertains clueless losers.The relationship between Scully and Mulder is almost addicting, because you can't wait to see where their friendship goes next (although us frequent watchers know what happens), and their commitment to each other is touching.

I wanted to believe. I couldn't wait to wrap myself in the truth. After five seasons of the show, I was ready, but did the film do it's job? It's really a mixed bag. A lot depends on your affection towards the show.While I'm content with the transition from television to the big screen, I, like many other fans was hoping for more. I believe they took the movie down a notch hoping to appeal to a wider audience. I'm hesitant to say it's been dumbed-down, but it may as well be. Which in business terms makes a certain level of sense. You want to increase your profits via the mainstream market. Basically those people who don't watch the X Files or even know what it is. Of course, this juggling act demands you fight to keep your dedicated fan base happy. Making it a feature film with a double digit budget is going to afford it some leeway, but at the end of the day it will all come back to the hardcore fan base and this leads to the film's biggest flaws which only a fan like myself could gripe about.On the surface all the right elements are here. Rampant paranoia, lies, murder, conspiracy theories abound, the usual faces. The visuals work, the theme music is still great as always and the acting throughout is solid. What's missing are things as a fan I expected to see. A darker atmosphere for a movie versus television and the tone one comes to expect from the source material. I couldn't help but feel the movie was too bright for it's own good. Give me the darkness, the necessary evil conventions of the X-Files.There's a share of triumphs and disappointments for the X Files on the big screen. You get some satisfying moments of action and dialog, but some elements feel like they got lost in the mix all together. The biggest disappointment is the film never answers any real questions. It just keeps adding stuff to the mix and some of it comes off feeling old and used, material the show has trend before and for fans this is not such a good thing. Throughout the show, we know no one believes them, we know they will have no proof at the end and we know the majority of things will remain unchanged at the outcome. This movie is no different. I am particularly sick of those cliché boardroom scenes where a panel dismiss anything Mulder or Scully have to say. It's time to cut the life support on these recycled elements. My threshold would be higher and I could withstand more of them if only we'd get some answers instead of more questions without answers, self-doubts and dubious plot holes.I suppose one could question if this was intentional or not. They've never been very liberal with the truth and giving out answers. Maybe this whole thing was meant to be nothing more than a tease. That itself is formula now. The next entry (because you know they'll be one) has to be more for the fans and not for the general public who barely show up for a feature that has been made easier for them to accept. They also better be willing to finally cave in and give us some clear cut answers too or I will be a lot less forgiving to see Mulder and Scully go through the same paces all over again. I don't deny the movie is an entertaining entry into the world of the X-Files, but it didn't address many of my needs as a fan.

Meanwhile, a building in Dallas containing FEMA offices explodes, killing five people.  Terrorist plot or a sinister government coverup?  Our heroes Scully and Mulder take us through an action-packed two hours where we not only discover the answer, but lots more.You don't have to have watched the TV show in order to like this film.  All you really have to know is contained within the first fifteen minutes--no cheesy flashbacks or anything, we just get to see Mulder and Scully in true form as she reluctantly follows him on yet another one of his crazy jaunts. But I think it does help to know the running plot on the series--where Mulder and Scully do battle against the Cigarette Smoking Man and the Consortium, resulting in alien abductions and implants and terminal cancer and alien bounty hunters and what have you.One thing I didn't like was the unbalanced profanity.  It felt a little tacked on with Mulder.  Scully, on the other hand, was supposed to say something really vulgar (I can't remember what) during the scene by the railroad tracks, and by cutting it, I think they really cut the intensity of her frustration.Also, I thought Martin Landau was a poor casting choice--I didn't like the way he played his character.  His character had a lot of potential, but it was wasted.What this film manages to do is give significant answers to that running storyline for regular viewers of the series, while being entertaining and engaging for those who've never seen the show.  It's remarkable how they pulled it off and remarkable that they even pulled it off at all.  It sent me away smiling.

The two greatest strengths of the series was in full force the mythology and the ever-evolving relationship of Mulder and Scully.  The most disappointing was that no more answers were given particularly the Samantha factor, but that's part of the charm.The plot was excellent in relating to any non-regular viewer of the series just how epic the whole idea of the X-Files really is.

Their love for each other is SO obvious but their respect for their close friendship is even more romantic.

With marketing hook ups as Never letting his main characters fall in love, never clearing the mysteries in its entirety and documenting the paranormal events he portrays on the series with scientific and intellectual background information the creator has achieved to form one of the greatest television shows of the 90´s.Now, Chris Carter has achieved one more thing, to take those one hour TV episodes to the big screen with intelligence and an enormous ability. Even though the movie is a BIG, LONGER AND MORE EXPENSIVE episode he didn´t get carried away by the budget, which is bigger than the one he has for the TV episodes and managed to deliver a movie with an extremely clever and deceiving plot. I know  that The Truth is Out There, but Carter is giving it out to us in little teaspoons.David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson have made personal creations out of their characters (as also has William Davis with his Cigarrete Smoking Man persona). And fans have grown fond of them and learned to love them to the point of maddingly hoping for them to get hooked up sentimentally.The mythology of the series, which gets continued in the movie only with a bigger and more epic scale, has made us all try with all our efforts to discover the real nature of The Conspiracy planned by The Sindicate with no satisfactory results.Mark Snow´s score is even better when he is supplied by a grand orchestra.And you can see that Carter restricted himself in the use of special effects. This movie is for real Sci-fi fans.I really think (in my most personal opinion) you better watch the mythology TV episodes before watching the movie or you´ll never understand some important things, clues, situations and relationships between the characters.

On the one hand, it had to be accessible to the general audience in order for the movie to be profitable, but on the other hand, Chris Carter had to make sure fans of the show wouldn't feel disappointed. He nearly gets this balance, and ultimately what we have is an eminently watchable thriller, that offers up a great deal more than it wants or cares to answer - much like the conspiracy episodes of the tv series.If you look at this in context with the series, it is one of the more straightforward plots Carter has written; but as a segue between the fifth and sixth seasons, it seems to contain several contradictions. However, taken as a stand-alone movie it does work, and the acting throughout the movie is generally top-notch, but you would expect this after 5 years of the show.As an introduction for non X-Philes it achieves its objectives, but for long-devoted fans I sense they may feel let-down, because ultimately Carter merely glosses over the conspiracy, only adding a couple of twists to what is really going on.

It was as frightening as, if not more than, the terrifying series itself.  Only this time, the scale of the cover up is much greater, and more frightening.  I don't like how they showed the alien with the action figures, or the extra bits of footage that found their way onto the videocassette.  It was scarier in the theaters, because all we could see was this killingly fast mass moving and screaming about.  And the ending is very scary, because it's so ambiguous, just like the series itself.  I think the trailers sold the wrong movie, because they said that the truth, the final truth that fans and viewers alike were waiting for, was coming.  We didn't get the truth.  We didn't get any further than we usually do in the series.  But it is the closest that we and the famous agents, Mulder and Scully, have gotten to the truth.  This movie is meant for the big screen, and with very loud sound, because the point of the film is to scare us s***less.  That's on one level of course.  On another level, it's a continuation of the series, shown on the big screen, as it should be.  I was definitely frightened, and caught up in the drama and the excitement.

The movie's story falls squarely between the series' fifth and sixth seasons, which is, coincidentally enough, precisely when the film was released.  It plays like a bigger, badder version of a regular Sunday-night episode, one with a bigger, badder budget.  Part of the reason for the series' popularity lies in its rich cinematic feel and atmosphere, and this is brought with great success to the big screen.  Another part lies with the series' real accomplishment the striking of an amazing balance between dramatic closure and actual plot resolution.  The ability to leave the audience feeling satisfied while still leaving many unanswered questions, and often posing new ones, is creator Chris Carter's great miracle, one which he has accomplished only with lesser success in his second series, Millennium. Don't expect this movie to stand alone, independent from the series--like, for the most part, the Star Trek movies do--or to get around to answering all the questions it asks.

The cast and crew had to sign secrecy clauses in their contracts and only received the final pages of the script near the end of production. All these cloak and dagger techniques made for good publicity and anticipation by the legions of fans who were wondering if some questions from the series would be answered and if so which ones. The good news is that some questions were and more questions were posed.  This was the one movie people had to see this summer, and if you haven't seen it yet, it's now available on video priced to sell.FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are on a routine assignment when we first join them on a roof  investigating a bomb threat. Now that the X-Files have been closed, they are reduced to doing standard assignments. Little do they know that the building houses several victims of an alien virus that was contracted from an underground cavern in Texas.A high ranking FBI officer (Armin Mueller-Stahl) is called in to diffuse the bomb, but deliberately allows it to go off, thereby killing himself, and destroying the evidence. This causes Mulder and Scully's suspicions to rise and they come to the conclusion that once again the U.S. Government  is hiding something.As the story progresses, Mulder meets up with the paranoid Dr. Kurtzweil (Martin Landau), and gets caught up in yet another conspiracy.  A conspiracy that could possibly answer his questions about his sister.When Scully contracts the aforementioned virus through an infected bee sting, The X-files quickly turns into a action movie with Mulder racing from Washington to Texas  and to the Antarctica to find the cure.Director Rob Bowman does an excellent job of keeping the suspense intact and filming the elaborate action sequences. If  you didn't know any better, you would think  that this was just an extra long and big budget episode of the series. That's because it wasn't exploited for the big screen and blown over the top. There are bigger explosions and special effects, but  the characterization isn't forgotten. All the key cast members from the series are in it and Mulder even gets to swear a few times. This turns out to be  a really captivating, intense, and well written movie.As for the X-files questions Are they answered? Yes and No. There is some insight from a key cast member into the disappearance of Samantha Mulder (Mulder's sister) and Mulder's father's involvement in it, but nothing concrete. There is a rumored director's cut that is supposed to be released early next year on DVD that apparently goes into more detail about this, but nothing is confirmed.During the course of this movie, there is a hint of a romance between Mulder and Scully. However, as Chris Carter stated in previous interviews he likes to tease the audience. With all the answered questions, a lot more are asked, and we will be glued to the TV set this season to find out what the explanations are.X-Files Fight The Future follows all the rules of good movie making a strong beginning, a twist in the middle, and a big ending. This one keeps you glued to the screen for the whole 122 minutes of it. But be warned -- if you haven't followed the television series you will be totally lost. This was intended to bridge the gap between the last year's season finale and this year's season premiere.

Chris Carter and Co.'s first foray into a big screen adaptation of the cult show easily captures this aspect. The movie begins where the show left off (with some minor and major exclusions) and Carter & Co. manage to segue neatly into a new plot direction. Mulder's scene in the bar and Scully's conversation with Mulder in his hallway fill in the gaps for Non-Philes while giving enough juice to keep the daily phile interested... Carter makes use of the FX and scenery possibilities open to a Big Screen, and thus allows the viewer to visually take in everything from an FBI buidling's destruction to the Artic to the Desert. Despite the success of plot and wonderful jobs done by Anderson and Duchvony, the movie ultimately feels like a two hour episode. Those expecting more will be disappointed. Those in for the ride will enjoy it immensely...

My wife was able to follow along with very little problems (the problems came from closing her eyes during some of the gorier parts and missing some key info).  Yes, it was like an extended episode of the show, but when you have so many episodes that could be movies, the two have a tendency to blend.  Nothing wrong with that, IMHO. Any STAR TREK fans out there will tell you that the first STAR TREK movie was just horrible (except my college roommate, who liked it for some reason), and X-FILES was *way* better than STAR TREK.

I am not a fan of the X-files series, nor have I ever viewed an episode. Knowing nothing more than the characters names and some pretty basic things about them, I knew very little of the X-Files.This film was made based on the belief that anyone would be able to sit down and watch and understand it, regardless of whether they had watched the series before. In my case I found this to be true. Knowing nothing of the series did nothing to take away from my understanding and enjoymnent of this film.I liked this film for many reasons but mostly for the speed of which this film moves at. Everything is told and completed in minimum time and yet still is very effective. Take for instance the whole bombing scene. We start off on top of the building and less than seven minutes later, the building is destroyed and the plot for the rest of the film is set. The acting of Duchovny and Anderson is also quite superb and for some reason was a lot better than I anticipated. Perhaps it was because each were only masters of the T.V. domain or Duchovny's performance in Playing God. Special Effects in this film are another area that succeeds. Compared to other Sci-fi blockbusters they are nothing , but I believe that anything more in this film and it would have all seemed too much.There are a few downsides to this film that I found, but then again could have been different for a regular viewer of the series. The area that most confused me was the ending. The logistics behind Mulder getting to Antartica, finding the right spot, not getting caught while doing so, falling through the snow in the right spot, knowing where to go once in the lair, finding Scully, releasing Scully and getting out all seemed much too farfetched for me. After all, agent Mulder is no James Bond, he is perhaps just a slight bit more refined in some areas than the normal man. After the two escape, and Scully has just gotten out of the water entraption, one would figure that with mimimal clothing and drenched hair she would freeze in the harsh Antartic climate in only a matter of seconds, but she doesn't. It also seems that they would have had to wait a long time to be rescued and after a few minutes in the cold, each would have perished.Performances from William B. Davis as the Cancer man, Blythe Danner as the Well-manicured man and Martin Landau each add credability and suspense to the otherwise youthful feel of the film. The plot is believable and matched my expectations for this film. Chris Carter did a fine job and might even persuade me to catch a couple episodes of the series in the near future.The X-Files is a good film that won't make my ten best of 1998 but will get a recommendation to others to see it even if they do not watch the series.7/10 stars.

You and I both know that it would be tremendously cute if Mulder and Scully kissed, but it would RUIN THE SHOW! It's not meant to be.

It is about as good as an average episode, but this one lags a little, gets a bit boring, but at times, it livens up a lot.  The movie is about the alien black stuff that takes over people's bodies.

The X-Files Fight The Future is a magnificent film experience. I am a HUGE fan of the series, so I knew I would like it regardless. I am writing this from the point of view of a film buff. The tension in this film can be cut with a knife in most spots, the cinamatography and special effects are fantastic, and the acting is wonderful. Great job to David and Gillian for expanding not only their characters world, but also their personalities and lives. I have seen the film 7 times  I own both pan and scan and widescreen copies , and plan to watch it many more. I just can't get my fill. I especially like the way it answered one question, and asked ten more. True X-Files fashion. It is NOT, I repeat NOT, a big episode for one reason. It is WAY more fulfilling then your standard mythology ep.

I usually read reviews as a guideline, but I *do* expect them to be mixed. So the reviews on The X-Files The Movie didn't surprise me at all (although I would've liked to hear more from the non-fans of the show).Having in mind that Chris Carter had a very tough job trying to make the film appealing to X-philes and non X-philes, I think he did a pretty good balancing act. As someone else pointed out, a $60 million in-joke wouldn't make much sense. On the whole the film was enjoyable, not too convoluted, and answered some long-standing questions about the aliens and the Consortium's project. Some complained that we should also have learned Samantha's fate, but I disagree. Just imagine how mixed up a casual viewer would be! As an X-Phile, I believe I got value for my money.BUT... as much as I liked the film, I believe that the fans deserve more... and if we are going to have a film franchise once the series wraps up I would NOT appreciate the watering-down of the plot for the benefit of the non-fans and the studio's gross profit.

The plot to this may be a little too much for some people to handle but one thing that won't disappoint anyone is the amount of suspense this movie has.  One of the things I really like about some movies is that you don't know what's going to happen next and this film does an outstanding job at making that happen the entire way through the movie.  The characters Mulder and Scully are both 2 characters X Files fans have watched for the past 5 years and even if you don't watch it you will still enjoy them very much in the movie. It has also just been said that they are planning to make another X Files movie in the year 2000 when the 7th season is over so we do have another film to look forward to.  For those who have not seen this yet, watch it and be amazed.  And for those who think this is just another episode, name one episode in the past 5 years that could answer so many questions and have such thrills (even though most of the episodes are thrilling, none can compare to this) and such outstanding special effects that could make this movie look like just another episode.

Sadly, no. I think my main objection comes from the fact that TV-man Bowman and his team chose to plagiarise too many other films for special effects- Aliens and Titanic spring first to mind... any ideas as to this man's main filmmaking influence? Aside from that, this film was of primary notability for its blatant spelling-out of some things we had already pieced together from the series. While I'm certain that this was the point of making the movie, I'd have thought that this exposition could have been done in a less obvious manner. We watch the X-Files, give us some credit. Numerous cliches were used which could have easily been avoided, and once more, Scully was put in sexually (or pseudo-sexually) compromising positions only to be saved by big man Mulder. Despite all this, there seems to have been no character development to speak of within the film, and I'm picking that the next season will not show much difference from those preceding it. I watched the series for the irony, the in-jokes and the quirky relationships between Mulder and Scully. The X-Files Movie robbed the X-Files of much of its charm, suspense, uniqueness and mystique, putting a bright spotlight on things which need only be alluded to. I'm not sure if I can go back.

This is, however, completely irrelevant in relation to the film, as either way you're quite likely to be fairly disappointed.For those who fall into the latter category and need some background, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are FBI agents, assigned to investigate (but apparently never solve) paranormal cases, classified as the X-Files.  Mulder, nicknamed Spooky by his colleagues, is a firm believer in all things weird and is convinced that The Truth is Out There ever since he watched his sister being abducted by aliens in his childhood. Scully, a qualified doctor and a firm believer that all things weird have a rational scientific explanation, was assigned to the X-Files to debunk Mulder's paranormal explanations (most of which revolve around some sort of government conspiracy or other) but has been swayed by her experiences with Mulder that perhaps something unexplained really is going on.Anyways, for filmgoers who didn't know the above, after about half-an-hour or so through the film they're brought up to speed with some standard contrived let's tell everyone what's going on type scenes (including the old get-drunk-and-tell-the-barman classic). After which things don't really improve.There's a distinct aura of deja vu around the rest of the film, especially since it breaks very little (if any) new ground. Any seasoned sci-fi addict will instantly recognise the origins of most of the material (spot the references to The Abyss, Aliens, Species, The Thing and perhaps even Total Recall - it's not hard) which has appeared to have been cheerfully ripped off.For those who know and love The X-Files already, it's fairly standard recipe with double the dough so it spreads over two hours instead of one, some large dollops of unpleasant gory detail, sprinklings of bad language and a larger budget all added to the mixture to give it a 15 certificate and that big screen flavour.  But what leaves the sour taste in the mouth is that it's the fans that are being had.  It had so little big screen impact that watching the film just gave me the impression I was sitting too close to my own television.Duchovny and Anderson put in a reasonably decent but rather plodding performance with a good supporting cast - but then so they should, they've been doing little else for nigh on five years.  Acting in The X-Files must be like putting on an old pair of slippers.My advice is wait 'till it gets to video and watch it then.  Scaled down to the small screen, you'd be hard pushed to notice the difference from the regular TV series and less annoyed by the lack of decent cinematography and small-town scenery handling.Three out of ten - and that's mostly for the special effects.

That's when the movie begins, with Agents Mulder and Scully been reassigned for another cases, in here, they have to stop a bomb from blowing up in Dallas. And going from this, Mulder uncovers a conspiracy that evolves UFO's, government lies, etc, much like lots of episodes of the show. For the series fans, this is great, but for a regular viewer, the plot seems really weird, because it doesn't explain who is the Cigarette Smoking Man, who are Agents Mulder and Scully, what are the X-Files, etc. The script even tries to explain this to virgin audiences, but the few attempts seemed out of place, unnatural and even funny sometimes. This problem could've been easily solved with a prologue, explaining what's basically going on.The acting here is not a joke as many people say, but it isn't great also. Most of the actors here are regulars on the show, but there are also newcomers, like Martin Landau and Terry O'Quinn. The director here is Rob Bowman, another regular from the series, and he does a nice job. One particular aspect that is worth mentioning are the Special Effects, well done for 1998.Overral, this is an excellent movie for the fans of the show, but it feels weird for someone who has never watched or is not familiar with the story of the series.

No sci-fi first hour of faux suspense here! Without blatantly re-introducing the many sub-plots and characters, the movie whisks us away to the far corners of government conspiracy, and, of course, alien invasion. The action is seemingly large and the plot plausibly works, despite the television gold plated monotone delivery by Special Agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and tepid love interest Special Agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). I admit that after numerous viewings, I'm still unclear on how we went from black oil to full blown aliens but I do clearly see a modern day Indiana Jones adventure of global proportions, although as with all sci-fi territory, your mileage may vary.

But it does good with what it's already established it brings to the Sci-Fi genre , like The Matrix did, seeing as it is The Matrix predecessor in Sci-Fi greatness. This film, in my opinion, set the benchmark for conventional Sci-Fi and turned it into what we see now.This movie I was hesitant to see at first but after watching the first three seasons I thought i should at least give it a try and boy was I blow away. It's a mystifying and malicious experience in the art of conspiracy and deceit and it moves along at a very steady and easy pace that you can easily keep up with and a story you can understand and follow as it plays out. This is the kind of film that keeps you guessing and guessing till the end it never let's up with the intrigue and the tension, it brings so much to the table and you have no choice but to eat it all up one small morsel at a time that so good you can't resist, this film also gives you a gritter side to The X-files adventure that you didn't see in the series it puts the agent's in more peril and danger then they have ever been in before and that is also another factor that contributed to this films success.But when it comes down to it there is probably nothing bad you can say in this films honor, it's just to good to put down. The X-Files Fight the Future is great fun and it's a wild ride that you have to experience to believe, it's sinister and diabolical, it calculating and efficient in it's execution of it's craft and style. it brings more than it should and it does well with it and gives you a good show for your money and if your forgiving this film won't displease you. All in all The X-Files Fight the Future is a great Sci-Fi thriller that is a see and see again fun that you can't ignore. The X-FilesFight the Future is red hot.

If a person isn't a fan of the show, the movie is going to be problematic.The movie fails by not having a real concluding climax. The movie ends with Mulder finally seeing a UFO and the climax is that confirming revelation that they are real after a season when Mulder was brought to doubt that UFOs were anything more than a cover-up for biologic weapons research. This is a big moment for Mulder, but not for the audience. The audience was shown aliens early in the movie, so there was no question that aliens existed. For an audience that knows the truth, and has seen alien ships every bit as spectacular, and more, than what was shown here, it's extremely anticlimactic. The audience still doesn't understand underpinnings of the government conspiracy, doesn't see any resolution with the conspirators, and basically just saw a big budget episode of the series that remains open-ended. That's okay for the series because that's how the series works and that's why it's a fine as an episode tying together the fifth and sixth years of the show.Somebody, that wants to watch a satisfying movie that stands on it's own, isn't going to be completely happy with this movie.

Still, I'm happy to report that this film is a MOVIE, and not an extended episode of the TV series.  It's far from perfect, to be sure, but it's still better than most of the schlock that Hollywood churns out these days.     The plot involves a mysterious alien virus (known to us fans as the Black Oil - or maybe the Black Cancer, I got confused) which is trapped (and unleashed) in a cave in North Texas.  Rather than simply taking over/killing its host, it now begins gestating its offspring inside its human host.  The Syndicate, led by the Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis), attempts to cover it up by sending three victims of the virus to Dallas, where they've planted a bomb.  But Mulder (Duchovny) and Scully (Anderson) are soon on to him, and with the help of a paranoid doctor (Martin Landau), they're soon taking on the Syndicate in an attempt to save Earth.  Duchovny and Anderson have always interacted well, and both play to their strong points in the films.  The special effects aren't fantastic, but they're good enough.    The main problems I have with this film is 1) length/pacing and 2) supporting characters   1) Length/Pacing It's well over an hour longer than the TV shows, and yet it moves way too fast IMO. The plot is developed well enough, but too quickly we're dragged from one set-piece to another.  This leads to problem no. 2   2) Supporting Characters I didn't mind this as much as might have since the story was Mulder/Scully centric, and of course Landau did a great job as the doctor (forget his name at the moment), but the show's regular supporting characters are sorely underused.  The Well-Manicured Man (John Neville), A.D. Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), the Lone Gunmen (Tom Braidwood/Dean Haglund/Bruce Harwood), etc., all appear only briefly and have little to do.  WMM, played by Neville, an actor in the great British tradition, at least does something relevant to the plot; he helps Mulder find Scully and a vaccine for her, and then he's killed off.  William B. Davis (the infamous Cancer Man) appears more often than his comrades, but has next to nothing to do and no real quiet scenes.  The Lone Gunmen have ONE hilarious scene and then bow out for ever.  Skinner does next to nothing besides lead Mulder and Scully to their hearing and speak to Mulder in the hospital.  Even the guest stars, like Armin Mueller-Stahl, one of Germany's great actors as Strugholdt, the Syndicate's unofficial leader, has only two scenes in spite of top billing.  To his credit, Landau (and indeed the whole cast) does good with what little they have to feed on, but they cannot be blamed for being underwritten.Those flaws aside, this is still a very interesting mythiarc episode, a good explanation into the events that began Season Six (which I saw BEFORE the movie) (though what happened to Gibson Praise see The End/The Beginning is not mentioned here), and all-and-all a fun waste of time.

It's vulgarized.  I'm not a big fan of the original TV series, although I suppose over time I've seen most of the available episodes.  Some of them are pretty dull.  But the writers as a collective whole had respect for the real fans.  The plots are often hard to follow and sometimes don't make sense but the real interest in any case was in the relationship between Mulder and Scully, as well as between the two of them and the mystery they were trying to unravel.  It was all very subdued.  Lots of dark rooms with flashlight beams waving around.  A bit of f/x with bumps running around under someone's skin but not much of that.  And, most endearing, a good deal of low-key humor.  But because not much is made of the comedy you have to watch carefully for it.  In one episode, Mulder confronts a self-proclaimed mind reader, thrusts his head forward, and says, Read this thought.  The mind-reader raises his eyebrows and snaps back, So's your old man.  The exchange is over in a few seconds.  All of the humor was rather like that.  And it's missing in this movie, which takes itself much too seriously and tries to make up for these kinds of oblique quotidian exchanges by an expanded scale.  A building in the movie blows up in tremendous fireballs.  Cars actually -- can you believe this? -- smash into one another when they crash.  Special effects abound in a way they didn't in the series, overcoming the mind, boggling it with their scale, a huge space ship, a hole in the ice!The plot is as silly as any of the sillier ones in the series.  A government conspiracy revolving around a virus that was stored by the original aliens who inhabited the earth -- am I getting this right? -- and it winds up with Mulder stalking across the infinite expanse of antarctic snow and happening to fall into the only available hidden three-foot-wide hole that leads down through three or four layers until he finds himself lying exhausted at the bottom of a thirty foot chute in the ice.  Does he try to get out?  Not on your life, or on his either.  He digs deeper, which only makes sense, as long as your trying to come out in China so you can order General Tsao's chicken in General Tsao's Original Chinese Restaurant.The acting.  Dealing with Gillian Anderson first.  She has a skewed kind of beauty, her face from certain angles resembling a Renaissance sculpture, and from others an ordinarily toothsome Hausfrau.  I find myself wondering what her molars look like.  Her figure is odd as well, no neck to speak of, and a muscularity that bespeaks Bronco Nagurski.  I don't mean that to sound worse than it does.  She's an extremely attractive woman.  Love that nose, which reminds me of an overhanging ledge I once took a photo of in the Blue Ridge Mountains.  Her acting is adequate, both here and in the series, but it's impossible to tell what sort of legs her career will have because her range is necessarily so constricted.  David Duchovny, I am assured by multiple sources, is a big hearthrob.  His face has been described as panty melting.  Okay -- I don't hold that against him, despite my jealousy.  He seems like a nice guy.  I'd like to play poker with him.  But, as in Anderson's case, the role restricts him.  I can't tell whether he's an actor or not.  I've never seen either of them in anything except their series.I genuinely believe that fans of the series might as well stick with the series.  A few miles of rough road now and then, but it's a superior TV entity.  This movie is not much more than exploitation of the fans' interest.

But a while back I began watching it on Netflix. I liked it. Pretty good stuff. And then I came to the end of season 5. I knew there was a movie that was made to sort of provide a bridge between seasons 5 and 6. I also knew that supposedly one didn't need the movie to move from one season to the next, but I decided I wanted the whole X-Files experience and started searching the movie down. I had to try a few different places, but eventually came across a copy and watched it. I wouldn't exactly say that I was disappointed with the movie. It wasn't bad. It just seemed to me that what I was watching really was a TV show being expanded to fit the big screen. It was OK, but I can't honestly say that I sat transfixed by it.The movie ties into the events of the last episode of Season 5 basically as Mulder and Scully are facing a hearing having to do with some of the events of that episode. There's no other real tie-in to the series, except, of course, the very general alien conspiracy angle. Two of the recurring groups - for lack of a better word - appear in this (the Lone Gunmen and the Syndicate.) The Syndicate, I thought, was strengthened by the addition of Armin Mueller-Stahl, an actor who always impresses me and who fit the part well. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson are both fine in the roles of Mulder and Scully - which they should have been; they had been playing the characters long enough. The movie perhaps tries too hard to prove that it's a movie and not a TV episode with the addition of some rather mild cursing, which came across as - to me - out of place, if only because Mulder and Scully never curse! To me, that just became a distraction because it was out of place and out of character; it seemed like series creator Chris Carter (who also wrote and produced the movie) saying look at me. I made a movie. Now we can swear!The story was nothing particularly special in my opinion. It revolves around the alien invasion idea, and toward the end when the revived aliens become a little more front and centre there's a clear influence from the movie Alien. I thought setting the last few scenes of the movie in Antarctica, with Mulder travelling alone through the Antarctic snows to save Scully came across as a bit silly. In fact, a lot of the last half hour or so of this movie really didn't satisfy me. I'm not sure whose idea it was to turn the TV show into a movie (while it was still a TV show and would continue to be for several more seasons) but I don't think it was the wisest decision. The X-Files should be a small screen experience in my opinion.

But the biggest problem with both the TV show &#150; and this movie &#150; is that there is no really eerie or interesting or unique mood created. It's all rather plastic-looking, like the typical TV drama stuff of the 90s.The truth is out there, and it's this watch The Twilight Zone and Outer Limits (the b&w versions) because X-Files is a rather mediocre series.

The plot is remarkably convoluted - something about an ancient alien organism whose attempts to colonize Earth are uncovered by intrepid FBI agents Mulder and Scully - but Chris Carter's script maintains an equally remarkable sense of clarification, making explicit what might otherwise have been buried under tons of scientific gobbledygook. The narrative hops from scene to scene, location to location, while refusing to sacrifice its characters in favor of special effects set-pieces, but the film is nevertheless loaded with widescreen spectacle. There's a graphic explosion in the first twenty minutes which is uncomfortably reminiscent of the real-life bombing which destroyed the Oklahoma Federal Building several years earlier, and another explosion during the climax which leaves a VERY big hole in the Antarctic landscape. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson adapt to the new format with ease, and the fine supporting cast is a veritable who's who of veteran character actors. Many fans are agreed that this is not the Files' finest hour, but the film plays fair with audience expectations and bodes well for future entries in this particular franchise.

During one of the assignments a bomb goes off in a Dallas building but it turns out due to an informant(played by Martin Landau) that the bomb was actually a cover up for the dead bodies in the building that had a virus of extra terrestrial origin. What happens then is the stuff that X-Files is known for(most notably the mythology episodes) government conspiracies, possible aliens, and black oil.Fight the Future acts as a bridge for the gap between seasons five and six but also tries and fails to hook in casual viewers who have never seen an X-Files episode. It's very clear that this movie is for the hardcore fans of the TV show mostly because there is very little exposition on who's who or what's going on unless you have watched the TV show. Despite that flaw I do believe that this is a good extended episode movie. Unlike most movies based on TV shows Fight the Future extends the plot with a higher budget and good storytelling of The X-Files variety. (Although parts of the plot borrow from Ridly Scott's Alien but I'm not complaining) But a few things don't make sense like the bee that gets stuck in Scully's shirt then stings her hours later in Mulder's apartment or the confusing connection between the black oil and the aliens in the movie. But then again, The X-Files never really explained everything and always left things ambiguous in the show which was one of the reasons for me why the show was so good when I watched it on Netflix.David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson are great as always as Mulder and Scully. Their chemistry was also one of the things that made the show great and the emotional payoff in the movie will only make sense if you watch the TV show. Martin Landau is always great in a lot of things that he does and the informant he does is a good role. Then there's Willian B. Davis as the Cigarete Smoking Man and what can I say the guy was perfect for the role because he had that mysterious atmosphere about him.Fight The Future is a well directed and well made movie despite some plot holes, inconsistencies and its inability to bring in new viewers unless they've watched the TV show.

I remember the intense fan base when the series aired and I've seen a few scenes flipping through the TV stations but that is it. The film makers of the first big screen X Files film stated that they wanted to make a movie for fans of the series, but also a movie that anyone could watch and they succeeded in that task in a big way because I loved the movie!! I mean X Files is enough of a cult iconic series that probably 99% of the world knows the basis of Fox and Mulder and a little about their background which I do so that certainly helps. But even outside of that they spend significant time on character development, a strong story that links the TV Series but also stands perfectly on it's own, and gives us a riveting sci-fi action experience. X-Files creator Chris Carter obviously has a love and a passion for the sci-fi but also for his characters and the cast he chose to play them. Director Rob Bowman has been doing Television, in particular great Television for two decades, and knows how to handle a story and bring it to the big screen which is no small task.David Duchovny has got to be one of the driest actors on the planet. There is very few roles that could suit his style but Agent Fox Mulder is most definitely one of them. As Mulder he makes everything seem possible and plays the lead very well. He makes the film move at a good pace and plays the role of Mulder to perfection. Gillian Anderson is and always has been Ying to Mulder's Yang. Anderson and Dochovny have unmistakable chemistry and yet both of them as actors and their characters seem very dry...perhaps a testament to the writing and creation of Chris Carter because they are superb in their roles and go above and beyond for the film. Martin Landau is terrific as the conspiracy driving force Dr. Kurtzweil. He is really the most prominent supporting actor and everyone else shares little screen time but they all do great and it appears as though some of the staple characters from the series are also there.Of course there is more to bringing a TV Series to film than making it watchable for non-fans but that does give them big points because I loved it without ever having former plots or stories to know about. And yet fans seem to love it too so they succeeded. On it's own merit the story is a terrific thriller with plenty of conspiracy and aliens and Government cover ups and takes you from Dallas to the Arctic in a heart beat and leaves you wanting more!! The film definitely makes me want to see the series and follow up on the characters and that is also a sign of a great film from TV. The special effects are top notch and everyone does a great job and the story is so fluid and riveting. Plenty of memorable moments to say the least. So if you love science fiction, conspiracy, or even have always thought you would like The X Files, do yourself a favor and check this one out because it won't disappoint. A real gem and sure to be a classic for years. 8.5/10 "},{"Title":"First X-Files a good effort","Date":"25 July 2008","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi","Review":" As an early fan of X-Files, I loved it. Of course, I enjoyed the stand-alone episodes of unusual surreal experiences behind a potential real situations. The episodes around the mythology of government conspiracies and alien extra-terrestrials were okay for me, but often got too convoluted and labyrinth. X-Files, Fight the Future, is the latter, actually embedded as a bridge between seasons five and six. That, for me, was on strike against it. In this sense, it was dubious that non-fans of the X-Files television series would venture in. They might be too confused. On the other hand, maybe that was the goal since the television show went into syndication that year. The only other strike was the slip-shod direction of Chris Carter. I think his writing with Frank Spotniz is better, and as executive producer, he is a master-mind. With those two gripes out of the way, I will say that X-Files Fight the Future does work as a thriller and action movie. We begin in West Texas. This initially starts in the last Ice Age about 100,000 years ago, and comes to today. A young boy discovers a cave with a strange alien blood. The movie jumps to Dallas where a bomb threat has been called in. Mulder plays a hunch and searches the building across the street. It is. They evacuate the building. Still, three people are dead, including an agent. Now, Mulder and Scully are grilled for their actions. It seems the powers that be were upset in finding the bomb because it was part of a government conspiracy. Mulder meets Dr. Kirtzweiller (Martin Landau) who claims to have special knowledge of the conspiracy. The links he gives Mulder lead the tandem duo to a military morgue, some train tacks, a corn field, and a strange facility with bees. All the elements are fragments of a larger picture the audience has trouble seeing. Eventually, Scully gets sick, and is intercepted. Mulder must now find her with the help of his supervisor, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pillegi) and the well-manicured man. Despite the flaws of slip-shod direction, and the convoluted plot, I find X-Files very entertaining. It has suspense, action, and intrigue in line with a mystery. The chemistry between Mulder (David Duchovny) and Scully (Gillian Anderson) is wonderful. Both are passionate about the ways they arrive at the truth. They have enough tension for creativity, but not too much to make it destructive. As for those outside the television fan craze, I don't know. But X-File fans will definitely like this one.

Soon after a group of sinister men in suits arrive to clean up... The X Files are now closed & both FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) & Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are assigned to more mundane tasks like dealing with terrorist threats in Dallas where Mulder discovers a bomb which ends up detonating & destroying a building, causing $45,000,000 in damage & killing five people. Someone has to take the blame & Mulder & Scully are it, however a Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil (Martin Landau) contacts Mulder & says that the explosion was in fact planned by his own people to dispose of three bodies infected with the alien virus. Mulder decides to investigate Kurtzweil's claims & discovers aliens, conspiracy's, cover ups, shadowy figures & a sinister plan that could wipe out the entire human race...Directed by Rob Bowman the only, thus far, big screen outing for Mulder & Scully is a pretty good film, I have seen most of the TV series although not since they were first aired here in the UK probably over 10 years ago now so it is hard for me to compare the two. The script by Chris Carter works well, the basic story is good although I have to say any fan of the series may find it somewhat linear & predictable. The film also has a big climax in which it starts to resemble Aliens (1986). I think I'm right in saying that the alien blood featured in this film is also present in some of the TV episodes so I guess it doesn't really take things in any new direction. I also thought that it went on for too long, I personally like short films as my interest begins to wain easily & I must admit I did start to look at the clock to see how long was left. I would have preferred if the story had more of a mystery element, we the viewer know what's happening & we have to wait for Mulder to catch up, as it were.Director Bowman, a veteran of the series, does nothing spectacular. There are a few nice wide aerial shots of deserts, snow covered landscapes but for the most part it looks like the TV series. There are a few aliens in it, a fairly tame autopsy & a few splashes of blood but nothing too graphic.With a budget of about $66,000,000 all I have to say is where did the money go? That's a hell of a lot of money for a mostly character driven film with two big CGI effects (a building blowing up & a huge spacecraft at the end) & no major stars. It's well made & has that Hollywood polish to it but that is a lot of money considering what ended up on screen, to my eyes anyway. The acting is OK but it's not like Duchovny or Anderson haven't had practise in the roles, is it?The X Files is a good film with a entertaining sci-fi type plot, fans would probably be disappointed as I don't think it's a radical departure form the TV series but, as I said, I think it's a solid film.

Well, the television show was always like a mini feature film, the production style and the moody photography making it more of a cinematic experience than a televisual one which is why I think this big screen version works so well. Chris Carter writes the script, it's directed by Rob Bowman, scored by Mark Snow, edited by Stephen Mark and the visual effects are handled by Mat Beck, the television team, and you know what, that cinematic style that the television show did so well transfers to the big screen superbly. This is The X FilesThe Movie and boy is it good. Moving the production from moody Vancouver to sunny Los Angeles is a good move. While the film retains that dark moody look (just take a look at the fantastic scene where the Syndicate meets) we also get the look of a Summer blockbuster (which this film was).Essentially The X FilesFight The Future is a continuation of the mythology (story arc) begun in the television series where Mulder and Scully strive to stop the colonization of Earth by a benevolent force of extra terrestrials being conducted by a shadowy government known as the Syndicate (which appears to be a global affair, not just an American one if the film is anything to go by). Not strained by the budget or time constraints of a television show budget, here Carter and Bowman get to have more fun and place in sequences that would never have been possible on television. We get the fantastically staged, if frighteningly realistic, bombing at the start, the thrilling helicopter chase, the secret under Antarctica and it's destruction at the rising of an alien ship. The mythology, which was essentially Mulder's quest, the forefront and spine of the television series, which was always a personal quest, now becomes an epic struggle, no longer a personal one, even though, going by the special edition version here, still has links to Mulder's attempts to discover what happened to his sister. All of a sudden the Syndicate is a world wide affair, the FBI stretches beyond Skinner and the Syndicate's nefarious schemes reach out beyond rail road cars and hospitals in middle America. This is a fantastic big screen transformation if you ask me.Carter's script is as good as expected and the direction of Bowman is, like on the shown, assured. The best director on the series, his episodes were always the most cinematic visually and he doesn't disappoint here. Then there's the performances from the main and supporting cast. Duchovny and Anderson are superb as always, especially Anderson as Scully faces tough choices over her career, while the supporting cast is made up of new and familiar faces. Cigarette Smoking Man and Skinner are present, but John Neville as the Well Manicured Man steals the honors as the best of the supporting cast from the show as the character once and for all lays it all on the line and shows us that he was a good guy all along, while fine support also comes from Martin Landau as Kurtzwiel, Mulder's informant who quickly gets the Deep Throat/X treatment. Forever tempted away from casting big names on the show, doing it here works, not just because it's a movie, but because like Jodie Foster, Mimi Rogers, Michael McKean and Bruce Campbell, Martin Landau really fits the role here and it doesn't feel like a star cameo for the sake of it.The X Files works so well on the big screen and we really shouldn't be surprised, but it's been five years since this film and I hope that that summer in 1998 will not be the only time I and other X Philes will be able to see it where it so clearly belongs.

The X-Files, when watched chronologically, is one of the most rewarding and thought-provoking TV series ever. David Duchovny (Mulder) and Gillian Anderson (Scully) are one of the best teams in TV history, and had almost instant chemistry. Awesome supporting actors like Mitch Pileggi (Skinner), William B. Davis (Cigarette-Smoking Man), John Neville (Well-Manicured Man), and of course, THE LONE GUNMEN ~!, also help the cause. The movie is set in between series' five (the last truly great series) and six (a very good series, but one where X-Files goes Hollywood, the comedy is raised too high, and writing usually not as good as before), with the conspiracy in full swing. Mulder gets closer to the truth than ever, actually entering a huge UFO in his attempt to rescue Scully from capture. The shadow government group, those being the X-Files' main villains (though not all of them are bad people), are in full force in the movie, with one of the best members being killed off in the movie. The problem with this movie is that it's more of a double episode than a movie. For non X-Philes, it'd be very easy to be confused by this. For X-Philes, the storyline is easy to follow and entertaining. The movie is very good, but I have seen better episodes on the regular TV show. The finish just serves to set up season six, which instantly follows up on Fight the Future (I love the episode names. Season five conclusion is The End, movie is Fight the Future, season six kick-off is The Beginning).

When the movie aired, it was awful. Hideous. The only redeeming part being that it had Sylvester Mccoy in it.What's the point? The X-Files movie is awful. It's a complete disaster. I was a fan of the series and when I saw the movie I gave up on the show. I watched 3 or 4 years for *that*?? The government is working with the aliens, because they'd wipe us out if they didn't? Huh? I don't even care if I'm getting the plot wrong. That's the whole point.Whatever. Talk about your serious letdowns. I think it's obvious that Cris Carter has no creative energies left. Millennium tanked. Harsh Realm lasted what, 15 minutes of its first showing?This movie is just a bunch of different episodes patched together. We get the informant that gets killed. Ooh! Shocking! That's never happened on the show before! We get Mulder and Scully reassigned. Gasp! Scully gets kidnapped! Holy god! How original!I've joked to other friends about this. Mulder should call the guinness book of world records people. Scully obviously has to have the record for most times being kidnapped.Another problem, and this is one I have with the tv series too. Why do they keep referring to each other by name, even when they're alone? If someone did that to me, I would be very worried. But then all of Hollywood has nameitis. How many times was the name Jack spoken out loud in Titanic? Enough already! Give us some credit for remembering characters names the first time they're mentioned.This movie is awful. Just horrible. The only people I can see liking it are people who bought into the hype, or were uberfans of the show to begin with. I was able to analyze the Dr. Who movie separately from my appreciation of the series. Why can't the same people who liked this movie?

The movie continue the run from the end of the fifth season where Season 5 end it and The X - Files got close. The movie begins here. The story follows Thirty-seven thousand years ago, a deadly secret was buried in a cave in Texas. Now the secret has been unleashed. And its discovery may mean the end of all humanity. When a terrorist bomb destroys a building in Dallas, Texas, FBI Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully are drawn into a dangerous conspiracy surpassing anything they've ever encountered. With the dubious assistance of a paranoid doctor (Martin Landu), Mulder and Scully risk their careers and their lives to hunt down a deadly virus which may be extraterrestrial in origin - and could destroy all life on earth. Their pursuit of truth pits them against the mysterious Syndicate, powerful men who will stop at nothing to keep their secrets safe, leading the agents from the cave in Texas, to the halls of the FBI, and finally to a secret installation in Antarctica which holds the greatest secret of all. Terry O'Quinn also stars as Darius Michaud FBI Agent who leaves that terrorist's bomb explodes in the building so they can cover the truth about the deadly alien virus. Chris Carter & Frank Spotnitz are awesome writers with story and amazing job by Rob Bowman as the Director of the movie. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson are amazing as FBI agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. The movie is the best i am glad that William B. Davis is also here as Cigarette Smoking Man and The Well-Manicured Man portrayed by John Neville are also here. Gosh i miss John Neville so so so much in Next Seasons in The X - Files.

The first was in the summer of 1996 when I saw Independence Day with my family. I was blown away. This was my first exposure as far as I remember into stuff about Area 51 and Roswell and little green men. I was absolutely enthralled. But the problem came in that there was no more information to be had from the ID4 well. So for the next two years I kind of played around with some different shows about the topic. The Arrival and Contact were two of the main ones and I also watched a few episodes of The X-Files and began to become very interested in the show. This brings us to the second event. Christmas 1998, my brother- in-law had my name to buy a Christmas present and he bought me a pair of jeans and the Collector's Edition of Fight The Future on VHS. I had never seen it and I honestly didn't know much about it. Ironically, we also got ID4 that year for the family and watched it numerous times together, but I stayed up late enough one night to have the TV to myself and watched Fight the Future for the first time. This was like ID4 for smart people. Elaborate plot with conspiracies and dark alleys and all kinds of crazy twists and turns and really big words that you never quite know how to spell let alone define. I loved it! I even loved my little trading card that came with it that simply quotes the following... Your aliens, Mr. Mulder, your little green men, arrived here millions of years ago. - Well- Manicured Man I remember reading that and it absolutely blew my mind! They've been here all this time? Since 35,000 B.C.? How? Why were they just hiding in that cave all that time? What the heck is going on? I gotta watch this show more! And so I did. As you can probably tell by now, this movie played a major role in my becoming a fan of this show. Now that I understand the mythology of the show better, I can watch the show and actually understand what is going on. I understand why WMM gave Mulder Scully's location and then blew up in the car. I understand the significance of the building exploding at the beginning and the bodies that were found. And I understand the link between the black oil virus and the little green men. The story is so complex that I won't waste any time trying to outline it but I'll go ahead and mention some of my favorite parts. The kid falling in the hole at the very beginning. Did you know that getting the wind knocked out of you is actually a spasm of the diaphragm muscle, that's why its hard to breathe, because the diaphragm doesn't cooperate. That poor scientist guy getting locked down in that hole with the alien, ugh. The bee silos and the helicopters in the corn field, that scene always comes up when I play Scene It. The entire last 45 minutes of the show in Antarctica is just amazing. The movie really doesn't have any flaws in my own humble opinion. I find myself simply wanting more of the same.

The plot was a little too straightforward, but it was great to see the spectacular  cast.  The first scene is the creepiest, but after that the movie never again  reaches that level of suspense.  Overall its not a bad film, but followers of the  series will definately get more out of it than the mainstream viewer.  My IMDB  rating 6.5/10.

It finishes off well what happens to Mulder's sister.  The only problem is that the storyline conflicts with what happens in the last season of the X-files, but that doesn't matter.

For one thing, Fox isn't in the habit of handing out $20 Million per episode. And secondly, what else would it be? The movie is based on a show called The X-Files, so you go to the theater expecting X-Files. Of course it's going to be like three big-budget episodes put together! What else would they do? Take completely non-related to X-Files things at make it a movie and slap the title The X-Files on it?

The typical Chris Carter incoherent plotting and wooden dialogue, only stretched out to fill two hours of screentime.  The story, heavily borrowed from the SciFi classic Quatermass 2, and without any attempt to credit the makers of that earlier film.  Product placement is everywhere, and not terribly subtle either.  But that would be forgiveable, if we'd been given a decent story to follow.  As it turned out, the ensuing sixth season of the TV show barely even referred to it.For both shippers and noromos, the long touted Mulder/Scully kiss was a travesty--and to make such a scene the central moment of the film only served to show how bankrupt the imaginations of the storytellers were.  And how bored Duchovny and Anderson were with each other by that point. (g)What was particularly depressing was how obviously the film was of established SciFi summer film cliches, from Star Wars to Alien--yet for some reason, Carter still felt he was entitled to take a potshot at Independence Day, even though the huge spaceship at the end is mightily reminiscent of the ones in that brainless but reasonably well-made alien invasion flick.  The SFX for Carter's film didn't impress anybody terribly much--we'd seen more innovative and effective visuals back in the early days of the show, when it was about the power of suggestion, as opposed to showing us everything--and then pretending nothing had been shown.The box office worldwide was decent, but not impressive, given how many viewers the show had around the world--here in the U.S., it became painfully apparent that a surprisingly large percentage of regular viewers of the show hadn't even gone to see it once.  At that point in time, there were quite a few of them, but their numbers would diminish mightily in the next few years, as it became apparent that the movie, rather than serving as a new beginning, had merely marked a convenient endpoint to the saga of Mulder and Scully.  And a lacklustre conclusion it was.  But far better than the one Carter gave us at the end of season nine.If there was any truth to be found in here, it was that Carter was not ever the secret of his own success, as a clear-eyed viewing of his lacklustre IMDb resume will indicate.  The true architects of 'X' were Glen Morgan and James Wong, at least in the early seasons.  But in truth, no one person could ever take all of the credit.  Which didn't stop Carter from trying.

It wasn't X-Files. It was more like a mixture of Aliens and Independence Day. I mean SPACE SHIPS?????? Come on! That's not your usual X-Files stuff is it? If this movie had been named as maybe Aliens 5 then I might have actually liked it. But it was not a good X-Files movie.  "},{"Title":"Give me a breeeak!! Please change the name of the movie to Total Extraterrestrial and i might mark it even with a 4.","Date":"21 February 2003","Score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Absolutely disgusting the way they have f***ed up one of the best TV-Series that it has ever been created. The music does not make you feel anxious of what it is going on. There is not a plot with a scientific Scully version (absolutely amazing in the series) but at the same time with reasonable theories, that you actually can believe as plausible most of the times, about some mysterious object or happening. There is not a good direction. The characters reminds me the typical crap American movies stereotypes.It might be another american movie, maybe even a bit entertaining, like several of them are. But once you have seen the series you are expecting soooo much more. "}]
