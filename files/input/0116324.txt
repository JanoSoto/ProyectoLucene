Human neuroses give rise to a lot of sympathetic laughter. Most of it is human frailty and absurdity. Tea Leoni is hilarious, and does a great job of getting on your nerves, and trying to get into Stiller's pants behind his wife's back while still being completely neurotic and self-absorbed. Her psycho-babble is highly effective. Stiller plays the usual awkward introspective man who lacks self confidence. His parents are magnificent, and so are his 'real' parents.

He gets on a plane with his wife, Nancy (Patricia Arquette), and the adoption agency associate that he is working with, Tina (TÃ©a Leoni).

Since much of the search will not happen until the adopted children reach a certain age nothing prepare them to accept the reality of how they came into this world and what motivated those parents to give them up in the first place.Such is the dilemma that Mel Coplin faces. He has been adopted by a Jewish couple, Ed and Pearl, who have done well in bringing him up; Mel is a well adjusted man. After his own son is born, he decides to track down his natural parents. With the help of a young woman of the adoption agency, Tina, he and his wife, Nancy, embark in a trip to find the parents he never knew.What seemed to be an easy task, Mel who is traveling with Nancy and the baby, plus Tina, turns out to be a complicated journey as the agency has botched the adoption papers and this quartet has to go through two sets of possible parents without any luck. When they finally get to the real parents, Mel is probably thinking if trying to meet his real family was worth all the trouble.Flirting with Disaster is at times a road movie because of the many turns the story takes Mel and his own family. David O. Russell directed the film with great sense of style as he takes us along. Ben Stiller, who still had not made a splash in the movies, is impressive as the likable Mel, who gets much more than what he bargained for. Tea Leoni who is seen as Nancy, made a terrific impression on us when we saw the film originally. She proves here why she was destined for bigger and better things. Her inter action with Ben Stiller is the best thing in the film.The rest of the cast is excellent. Mary Tyler Moore's Pearl Coplin is one of the best things she has done in her career. She makes this woman real. George Segal, a great comedy actor with great timing, appears as Ed Coplin. Patricia Arquette, who is Nancy, doesn't have much to do because she plays Nancy, the most grounded person in the film. Alan Alda and Lily Tomlin are the real parents, who are former hippies from New Mexico and in spite of being older, they still are young at heart doing the same things they did when they were younger.Flirting with Disaster owes a lot to David O.

This is modern-day dark edged screwball comedy that would like make master filmmaker Howard Hawks (His Girl Friday, Bringing Up Baby) proud.Russell's film weaves the ludicrous story of a thirty year old, first time father who can't overcome the challenges of not knowing his birth parents enough to see his wife's sexual advances or even give his kid a name. Who else could we expect to see in a role so heavily stacked with Murphy's Law possibilities than that consummate lovable loser Ben Stiller? Before we know it he, his wife, and an incompetent adoption case worker set out to meet his birth parents.What follows is the full range of comedic possibilities from the standard road trip to off-the-wall characterizations, mistaken identity, love triangles, attempted murder, and armpit fetishism.

And you'll finish thinking it's a pretty stupid movie. The ending in particular makes you wonder what all the build up was about since it diffuses, as if the writers ran out of conflicts (or solutions) and raised their hands in surrender.But on the way there is one funny gag after another. And a whole slew of excellent actors doing their zany best. Some of them have very brief (and contained) appearances, for sure--Lily Tomlin and Alan Alda, for example, in a hilarious section of the movie with little connection to the rest of it. In fact, the whole movie is broken into spasmodic sections, held together mostly by the three leading leads (there are lots of main characters) Ben Stiller (looking for his biological parents), Patricia Arquette (his suffering, sweet wife), and Tea Leoni (the mentally incomplete but skinny and sexy interloper). Stiller isn't actually totally funny by himself, but acts like more of a foil for all the crazy things happening around him (this is his style on purpose, a kind of regular guy in an irregular world). Arquette is almost too normal for this abnormal world, but that's fine, she's likable, and is meant to be the loving wife who doesn't quite know how zany the events around her are. At first. Leoni has a terrific way of making nutty faces and being just slightly insane without being just stupid (the way Will Ferrell is just stupid in a different kind of humor). There are gay jokes and jokes about LSD and a general playing of an ultra-licentious world against what seems to be a normal human desire to connect with your genetic parents, unknown to you. The mistakes along the way are what make it hilarious. Until the end, where it maybe is trying to say, Oh well, everything is okay in a world where anything goes. Sure.

Ben Stiller, his wife Patricia Arquette, and an adoption agency representative, Tea Leoni, go on the road in search of Stiller's birth parents.  Ben is nervous and mostly passive.  His wife apologizes for having put on weight during her recent pregnancy.  The statuesque Leoni and Stiller find themselves attracted to one another, although neither is ready for an affair.  The search takes them to San Diego where Stiller's mother turns out to be a materialistic nonentity with two radiantly healthy daughters, a big ranch house, a collection of glass zodiac figures, and no brains.  It turns out to have been a mistake.  They next find themselves in Michigan where Stiller's father is an ex-Hell's Angel who now drives a truck and twits Stiller for looking Jewish.  This is also a mistake.Next stop, Antelope Wells, New Mexico, navel of the universe, where Stiller's parents are revealed to be a couple of aging hippies, Alda and Tomlin, with a lunatic son who is a selfish and jealous young man who doses the quail dinner and sends one of the visitors on an unwitting acid trip.  Oh, the trio of investigators has picked up a male couple who are married.  One of them is Arquette's ex-boyfriend and likes to lick her armpit.Stiller's parents of orientation, a nice Jewish couple, show up unexpectedly, there is a mix up of vehicles, and Stiller's adoptive father, George Segal, gets caught by the police with his arms full of dope. Despite all the travel, the movie doesn't really go anywhere in particular.  Oddball is heaped upon oddball, gag upon gag.  Stiller stutters a good deal, and there is a lot of overlapping nervous chatter, and people normalize all over the place --  Alda explains that after Stiller was born, he, Alda, and Tomlin spent some time in the slams but it was for nothing.  Less important than a speeding ticket.  It wasn't even illegal.  Or it shouldn't have been.  Everyone was making LSD in those days and it's not addicting.The question isn't really whether the movie assumes the morphology of a Woody Allen movie, but whether it gets its job done -- and it does.  As far as that goes, the situational and conversational gags are funnier than many of those in Woody's recent movies.  And if the movie lacks depth, well, that's okay.  Deconstructing Harry didn't have much depth either, and neither did most of Charlie Chaplin.  If the style is a little irritating it's because we've seen it and heard it so often before.  But the jokes are usually funny.  The performers are up to the task and the pace never drags.  The direction is well handled too.  Example  Segal and Mary Tyler Moore discover that they are driving the wrong car, now immobilized on the highway, that it may not be theirs.  Look in the trunk and see if our baggage is there, says Moore.  Segal rummages through the trunk hysterical with worry.  No luggage.  Just a lot of junk in bags and briefcases, which Segal tears open to find that his trunk is now loaded with illegal drugs.  The cops come and catch him.  But the director doesn't spell out the entire ordeal for us.  Gradually, as Segal stares at the drug factory in his hands, and as he starts shouting at Moore, we see that blinking red lights are beginning to light up the scene and we hear a car pull to a stop off camera.  (We see no car, no cops, and we hear no voices.)  Segal, still holding the paraphernalia, turns towards the source of the red light wordlessly, with an idiotic smile.  Dissolve.  A less trusting director would have taken us through the entire encounter with the police, the two big brutes in intimidating uniforms and their baritone voices, Segal's and Moore's silly attempts at an explanation.  But what we see, though truncated, is funnier because it prompts our imagination to fill in the rest of the scene.  Not badly done.  Amusing, really.

All in all, not only was this a poor excuse for a movie, but 1996 was truly a low point for the usually dependable Alan Alda - he also starred in the dreadfully horrible Everyone Says I Love You, Woody Allen's worst movie ever.As just an extra note, I might add a little something. People didn't like The Cable Guy (directed by Ben Stiller) because they thought that Jim Carrey was wrong for the role; I liked the movie's impending sense of doom.

It fits the form of classical cinema or classical paradigm in that the director, David O. Russell, does not get distracted from telling the story with filmmaking techniques. It is a clear and precise comedy that never leaves the characters in action, and is done so in a way that works unlike many other films of this genre released today. The film is structured narratively, with a clearly defined conflict from the very beginning. Ben Stiller shines in his performance as a neurotic new father who is trying desperately to find his biological parents in order to name his newborn son. At one point in the film the viewer begins to become anxious and wonder if the same problem for the protagonist, Stiller, is going to continue on in the same form as it has in the past half of the movie, but luckily Russell then changes the flow of the film and brings it to a much more comedic finish than the first half.The photography is shot in full and long shots throughout most of the movie. Russell must have used deep-focus shots when filming because the surrounding background is clear around the characters, using a wide-angle or short lens. The characters are never off of the screen except for a few instances when we see a plane flying or a car driving and then we have voice-overs. The dialogue is always continuous- there is never a break in the script which works well because the screenplay is well written and clever on its insights on the little inconveniences of everyday life. Although all of these events are too unbelievable too happen all at once, they are all real life comedic situations that could happen to anyone. When compiled together with this plot line, we have this film before us.Although this is a typical movie in the sense that it does not break any barriers or do anything creatively in its techniques in telling the story, the plot and screenplay do enough justice in making the film entertaining for the audience and one of those films you can just sit down, relax, and have fun viewing because it makes sense and fits together. This aspect is not like many Hollywood films released today, with their gaping holes that leave the viewer feeling unfulfilled. Altogether this was a good film, even though it did fit many of the typical Hollywood stereotypes.

In this case I chose Ben Stiller who hasn't really changed his style of comedy that much since 1996. His mannerisms and silly face expressions are more or less the same but he's got bigger budgets to play with nowadays so he doesn't have to rely on his performances to much, like in Tropic Thunder and Night At the Museum. Anyway, this movie is about Stiller hunting for his biological parents after his wife gives birth to his son. With the help of his wife and his sexy adoption agency worker, who wants to film the whole event, they start there journey which has its ups and downs. The adoption agency ends up getting Stillers biological parents identify wrong so there journey becomes bigger then they first thought. When he finally tracks down his parents, the situation goes from bad to worse because of his parents weird habits and strange lifestyle. The movie was quite funny in parts but the storyline is extremely far fetched. The young Josh Brolin and his gay partner, played by Richard Jenkins, was quite a weird choice by the director but they played there parts quite well. I've always been a fan of George Segal and I liked the chemistry between Alan Ada and Lily Tomlin but I did lose interest after a while. Anyway, it's light hearted fun which is silly in parts, but watchable. Average!Round-Up It's weird seeing Josh Brolin star in a comedy were he is playing a gay role after seeing him in butch movies like Oldboy, No Country For Old Men and Sin City. The movie was made earlier on in his career so I can't blame him for taking on the project. This was also made earlier on in Ben Stillers career and it really does prove that his range is limited because he hasn't progressed as a comedian that much. His films always gross a lot at the box office and with Rentaghost and Zoolander 2 in the pipework, he is still a bankable actor for the big studios. I know a lot of people that are fed up with his movies but I doubt that he will go down the same route as Jim Carrey and Eddie Murphy, who find it hard to pull in the big audiences nowadays.Â Budget $7million Worldwide Gross $15millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their comedies about a man whose trying to find his biological parents so he can name his newborn baby. 4/10 "},{"Title":"A David O Russell film which shows that finding about one's real parents could be a real disaster.","Date":"13 February 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" It is no surprise that in many ways human beings reflect what their parents must have been. There is a biological perspective to it as this has a lot to do with the fact that children carry their parents' genes in them. However, there is no definitive yardstick for determining the behavioral traits of children as they might or might not have been influenced by their parents. All these ideas tend to give rise to an inherent desire to know more about one's parents especially 'one's biological parents'. This is a challenging as well as a serious theme which has been humorously represented on screen by American director David O Russell. For this reason, he takes us on a hilarious, fun filled ride across two different parts of America where a married couple meets up with other oddball characters. Apart from discussing issues related to bad parenting, 'Flirting with disaster' talks about a couple's conjugal life after the birth of a baby. Although most people would not like to be found in a position to generalize a work of art, this film remains a good example of American attitudes to drugs, marriage, relationships and sexuality. Hilarity is ensured as each character carries multiple flaws.

The craziness just overwhelms everything. "},{"Title":"Flirting with Disaster","Date":"4 September 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" David O. Russell directs Flirting With Disaster. The plot? Ben Stiller plays Mel Coplin, a young man who attempts to find the biological parents with whom he has never had contact. This, he hopes, will explain why he is why he is. Unfortunately Mel keeps meeting the wrong people, all of whom he keeps mistaking for kin. The film ends with Mel eventually meeting his genetic parents &#x96; a pair of marijuana growing hippies &#x96; but its overall point is that there are always other prospective partners, people and kin vying for our attention and more. What matters or defines us are ultimately the choices we make, rather than the genes in our bodies or the company we keep. This stance is the opposite of Russell's Huckabees, where choices seem irrelevant in light of social/cultural programming. Russell was a political activist/scientist before turning to film.Flirting With Disaster sports funny performances from Tea Leoni, Alan Alda and the oft underused Lily Tomlin. Its last and first acts are very funny, but things slow down during its middle portion. The film's structured as a road movie. If Russell's underrated I Heart Huckabees was a existential comedy in the vein of late Woody Allen, Flirting With Disaster is a light farce in the vein of Allen's earlier, madcap comedies.8/10 &#x96; Worth one viewing. "},{"Title":"Bringing Up Garcia.","Date":"21 October 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Flirting with Disaster is a true companion to classic screwball comedies of the 1930s and 1940s. Not too unlike Howard Hawk's Bringing Up Baby or His Girl Friday, David O. Russell's outrageous and often funny comedy takes its absurd and wild tone to the very end, seemingly slamming on the brakes just at the moment when we feel as if there is more to learn about these characters. This may be true but Russell's intention is to show us their behavior in this particular instance, that is finding Mel's (Ben Stiller) parents.Films like this depend almost entirely on the acting and writing for success. Fortunately, here they both are superb. The cast alone makes the film worth checking out. Stiller, Patricia Arquette, Tea Leoni, all the way down to Josh Brolin and Richard Jenkins as a couple of federal agents make their characters as weird, interesting and watchable as any comedy of the last 20 years. What also succeeds is the pacing of Russell's script, which is light on drama but moves at such a rampant speed that you barely have time to catch your breath in between jokes and situations. Needless to say, this film is a treasure. Not much more can be said without ruining the marvelous surprises and bizarre circumstances it has to lay out. All that is required is to turn off your conceptions of coincidence, realism and contrivance and simply enjoy a most enjoyable story about a man looking for identity and realizing perhaps he shouldn't have.

She performs average good - I still believe that her best film is 'The Family Man' with Nicolas Cage - and others, like Ben Stiller, also do an acceptable interpretation. I expected something better from him, I still have 'There's Something About Mary' in my mind, which was a great fun to watch. Though, here the situations were indeed very funny, however, maybe I was tired or what, I couldn't really laugh at them. I think the entire atmosphere, the conversations, the people, the landscape were typical American, and at least I got an impression of the 'everyday' American lifestyle. The final scene surprised me, as the story didn't really end, just stopped as it started. So, this is just an average Sunday afternoon DVD to me, in fact, it didn't even reach the cinemas in Hungary. 6/10 "},{"Title":"One of the best comedies--this is real humor","Date":"2 December 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" David O. Russell recently came out with I Heart Huckabees, which was definitely a comedy, but also a very smart, philosophical film about life. Flirting with Disaster is a much different kind of movie, but he uses the same kind of humor-focusing on the character personalities.In Flirting with Disaster, Ben Stiller is married to Patricia Arquette. They just had a baby and are trying to give it a name. Meanwhile, Stiller is on a search for his real birth mother and is assisted by Tea Leoni in the Adoption Agency. So, the journey begins and along this journey, Stiller comes into contact with his mother and father, but they turn out not to be his parents after all. Now, two cops are part of the Stiller's group.Then finally, we meet his real parents, Lily Tomliin and Alan Alda. Now comes one of the best family/dinner table scenes ever shown in a movie. Alda's character is so funny that I almost died laughing. The acting is superb and the whole family appears to be so normal, until we find out about their acid and LSD problem.Some people probably won't appreciate Russell's humor because his humor isn't for everyone. A lot of the humor is very character based and dry (sort of similar to Wes Anderson's idea of funny).Well, after seeing this movie, people will hopefully appreciate the thought David O. Russell put into all the dialogue and people will have to appreciate the absurd and hilarious journey Ben Stiller took to find his mother...for better or for worse.

Every year there appears to be a batch of failed comedies that leave me shaking my head in disappointment and asking why?, but there are always a few that stick out as being superior examples of what the genre is SUPPOSED to be Flirting With Disaster is in the latter group. Simply put, it is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It recalls the great slapstick comedies of the fifties in which each scenario is blown out of proportion and the hysterics keep building and building until you start wondering how they could possibly take it any further ... and then they do. The story involves a middle-aged entomologist (Ben Stiller) who sets out to find his birth-parents with his wife (Patricia Arquette) and an adoption agent (Tea Leoni). To reveal any of the plot's twists would be a crime, but these snippets should give you a vague idea an Indian wrestling match ends in the collapse of a Chinese shrine; Stiller catches a bisexual cop licking his wife's armpit; and an officer from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms consumes two-and-a-half tablets of LSD. From start to finish, director/screenwriter David O. Russell delivers non-stop laughs and surprises, and yet he never makes the mistake of allowing the story itself to careen out of control -- as so many others have; the film remains anchored throughout to its simple message of family love. Each character is relatively devoid of stereotypes, and the story never succumbs to the unbelievable. The performances are nothing short of brilliant Stiller is a comedic genius, and his outrageousness is perfectly balanced by Arquette's subtlety. The supporting cast is a treat, featuring appearances by Mary Tyler Moore, George Segal, Celia Weston, Alan Alda, and -- most notably -- Lily Tomlin. Every single gag is perfectly timed, and the film itself is virtually flawless. The somewhat documentary-style direction is a nice touch, but I couldn't even begin to explain why the film succeeds as greatly as it does. This is just one of those instances in which the movie is so great, it doesn't even seem as if the film-makers were trying. While watching it I was vaguely reminded of one of last year's great comedies, Woody Allen's Mighty Aphrodite, and it's not difficult to figure out why Russell's writing recalls Allen's playful profaneness, proving that it IS possible to make an intelligent sex romp. So often I find myself too distracted by a film's flaws in order to simply enjoy it, but Flirting With Disaster proved to be an exception to that rule. See it for yourself to discover why it is one of the best pictures of the year.Grade A "}{"Title":"A competently-made, laugh-a-minute, romp.","Date":"22 February 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  This movie is ninety minutes of sheer hilarity.

'Flirting with Disaster', however, is climbing the list to become a classic. Before Ben Stiller became famous with 'There's Something About Mary', this film proved he had some real comedic talent and that this director was no one hit wonder. 'Flirting with Disaster' is the story of Mel and Nancy Coplin (Ben Stiller and Patricia Arquette) who are trying to find Mel's birth parents because he has been adopted. This story follows the adventures of them and adoption agency worker Tina (Tea Leoni) trying to find Mel's parents and they have some hilarious and very black fun on the way. Like I said before, Ben Stiller proves he's an excellent actor and he really should try his hand at some darker and drier material than the more mainstream stuff that he's working on now. Patricia Arquette proves she's a great actress and that she can be very real in a lot of her roles, much like the realness from 'True Romance'. Tea Leoni is absolutely excellent as Tina, the adoption agency worker and she's got more than good looks and nice legs. There's some small appearances from Alan Alda, Mary Tyler Moore and Richard Jenkins. For those coming intis film expecting it to be a Hollywood movie, you're not going to get it.

The critics seem able to see its brilliance, fortunately.For starters, the cast is positively star-studded and with many wonderful acting veterans whose universally famous roles were an integral part of my childhood. Mary Tyler Moore, Alan Alda, lily Tomlin (!). Dick van Dyke show, mash, laugh-in. It doesn't get any better than that-- they represent a lost past and seeing them reinvented, and all in one movie, is marvelous.I think the problem many people have with this movie is that they try to identify with one or another character to enter the escapist mode of movie watching and find that identification is impossible. For example, Mary Tyler Moore's comforting presence is quickly vitiated by her shrewish behavior. What is needed to fully enjoy this movie is a lot of ironic distance. Fortunately when I saw this movie, I was studying theater of the absurd, which has as a primary goal the frustration of precisely this escapist mode of movie watching. Movie watching in the escapist mode is like a drug and the typical viewer will scramble around frantically (like a lab rat in a maze) to find the sympathetic character with whom to identify, and to get started enjoying their fix.Needless to say, it didn't take me long to get over my consternation and get with the plan. The aesthetic pleasure of the absurdity, and the complicity of being in on the joke, are far greater pleasures than mere escapism.When I was a kid, I handled situation comedy poorly, (oh no!! How is Genie gonna get out of this scrape this time?). I was enjoying immensely the ironic aspects of this movie but still that ancient voice of anxiety and stress were still somewhat disturbing me during the viewing of this movie.It was quite a relief, then, that we see the faces of Lily and Alan as affable mom and dad, at the threshold of a warm cozy home in New Mexico. All would be well. Not so fast. When once again the plot turned outrageously improbable, I gave a belly laugh and thoroughly surrendered to the absurdity of the wild romp at the end.

From that point, it becomes mildly amusing, thanks to a terrific cast. It's nice to see the likes of Moore, Segal, Tomlin, and Alda, although sexual scenes of these old-timers is the kind of imagery one does not want lingering in the mind. This film provided Stiller with a career template for playing neurotic men who keep encountering disaster, but the script here is not as witty and the plot not as engaging as some of his later efforts.

Unfortunately, Ben has fallen into the same rut that haunts Eddie Murphy and others who have lost the sense of humor they once possessed after having children. Comedians should be sterilized for the good of their work. Ben stiller made the film Envy right around the birth of his first child and hasn't been funny since.The plot revolves around Mo Copeland, a thirty year old man who has just given birth to his first child and is having problems naming the child due to his lack of identity from being adopted. He sets out on a misguided journey to find his birth parents and hilarity ensues. Very funny movie.Go into this film expecting and knowing nothing and you will be entertained and laugh out loud.

Russell. He said he thought I would like it. Boy, was he right! I was then treated to 90-some minutes of wonderful dialog and interesting plot twists and a travelogue across America. The characters are so idiosyncratic, but have enough realism to be engaging. Stiller plays a neurotic NY Jew (any other type for Stiller?) who cuts the apron strings of both neurotic, overprotective parents and embarks with his wife (Patricia Arquette), baby son, and the unstable and lusty representative of his adoption agency (Tea Leoni), who constantly video tapes, to find his birth parents. The journey becomes more complicated along the way, and after additional unplanned destinations they pick up a most odd couple to travel with them.(I'm so proud that I have managed to avoid so many spoilers with that sentence.) The weird characters in memorable roles played by both the famous and the obscure include Mary Tyler Moore and George Segal as Stiller's adoptive parents, Lily Tomlin and Alan Alda as Stiller's other parents, Josh Brolin and Richard Jenkins as the gay G-men, Celia Westing as the southern belle with the glass zodiac animal collection in San Diego who may be the birth mom, David Patrick Kelly as the paranoid former Hell's Angel in Kalamazoo who may be the father, Charlet Oberly as the fascist B & B operator, and Glenn Fitzgerald as the hostile effeminate brother.

Russell did not capture his full potential, but instead demonstrated his budding capacity behind the camera. I will begin by agreeing with my wife when she commented that this was one of the best ensemble cast films she has ever seen. Russell manipulated and moved his characters into the right places at the right time that always felt even. He controlled the screen and moved the story to levels that I never saw coming. He continually kept fresh images in front of our eyes, and forced his actors, and us, out of their element to progress the story. It was obvious that Russell was a master behind the camera and was able to ensure that no zigzagging occurred that would cause us to falter or loose sight of our goal. While there didn't seem to ever be a bubble in the movement of the characters and story, where I found most of the bubbles occurring were the actors that helmed the characters. While each have their own discreet method of acting, I somewhat felt that they all just didn't mesh well in this story. Stiller was humorous, but lacked the depth that his character needed for us to really understand his plight. Arquette was sympathetic, but again the depth factor was obvious and there were times where I felt that she just wasn't giving her full potential. She was in the scenes, but I knew that it was Patricia Arquette and not the character she was to be playing. I can honestly say 'ditto' for Tea Leoni's character. There was just something missing. Maybe they needed more back story, perhaps we needed to spend more time with them, or perhaps it was the way that these actors pushed their characters that just didn't seem to mesh with the rest of the film for me. The only actors that really went above and beyond their call in this film were the secondary actors. Mary Tyler Moore was well out of her element and loving every minute of it (and so were we), Alan Alda and Liv Tyler were perfect together, and the best buddy-cop scene ever in a film could not have been done by anyone other than Josh Brolin and Richard Jenkins. They did not only provide some of the funniest moments in the film, but their scenes stole the film literally from everyone else. I could have watched an entire film on just these two and their idiosyncrasies. That would have been funny.As I look back onto this film I try to think of why I was so conflicted about my feelings towards it. It had some elements that I just found hysterical and could see Russell's style, but then there were times where I felt the actors were just flubbing this film completely out of control. This was a family neurosis movie. What Stiller was trying to do was find a cure for his (and possibly his newborn son) neurosis. He thought that by finding his true parents he would be able to bring some closure to his life.This was the focus of the film, but as I watched him go through the motions around his psudo-parents, I felt we lost focus of this goal. Russell's direction accurately kept us moving along the path, but Stiller was no guide. His focus throughout this film was about as solid as ice on a spring day. There are parts where we know where he is going and he is doing great, but other times he falls through the cracks. Thankfully, he has the secondary characters to back him up and help him out of his pitfalls. This film was not a perfect fit for Stiller. I thought for everyone else (sans Arquette), they fit perfectly into their roles. Stiller just seemed out of place.A 'find-your-true-family' caper can be funny. Russell's 'find-your-true-family' caper is funny, but not hysterically funny. The humor could have been more adult and articulate. I thought this was a decent film, but it didn't blow me away as the other Russell films have. It almost felt as if he had calmed himself down for this film. He didn't seem as eccentric as he does in his later outings. Russell goes through the motions and does very well, but his cast is what ultimately brings this film down a notch for me. Stiller is not a fit, Arquette character could have been played by a mannequin compared to her, and Tea Leoni needed to get some hot Duchovny action &#133; and soon! Again, I cannot thank the surrounding cast for their hard work and dedication because without them I don't think I could have survived this film. Russell's direction is ample, but Stiller's performance ruins. Overall, this is definitely a 'yheaah' film. Not quite a 'yea' and not quite a 'nea', but somewhere in-between. If you are a die-hard David O. Russell fan, I suggest checking this film out at least once to experience his power behind an ensemble cast (which again works well in I Heart Huckabees), but it doesn't deserve more than one viewing. Russell has made better films than this and I think you should stick to them instead of coming back to this one. Plenty will disagree, but that is how I feel about this film.Grade *** out of ***** "},{"Title":"Offbeat comedy has its share of humorous moments","Date":"16 April 2003","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  While I did enjoy this film for the most part I did grow a little tiresome of some of the dialogue and situations while the film was winding down. I'm glad the film is just under 90 minutes because if it went on any longer it definitely would have overstayed its welcome. Story has a man named Mel Coplin (Ben Stiller) who is trying to locate his birth parents and his adoption agent (Tea Leoni) thinks she has located them. Mel and his wife Nancy (Patricia Arquette) and their newborn hit the road first to San Diego where they think his mother lives. Mels adoption agent comes along so she can record Mel reuniting with his parents with a video camera. One of the volleyball girls is model Beth Ostrosky. Well, the woman in San Diego isn't his mother and then they go to Michigan where they think his father is. Eventually two gay cops come along for the ride and one of them is attracted to Nancy. The dialogue is reminiscent of Robert Altman's films and at times it seems improvised. One of the unique things that stand out in this film is the casting. George Segal and Mary Tyler Moore play Mels adoptive parents and Moore's character is very overbearing. She never stops talking and it reminds everyone that Moore is a good actress.  ****SPOILER ALERT**** Alan Alda and Lily Tomlin play Mels birth parents and they seem fine at first but everyone eventually finds out that they still take a lot of drugs! The casting is unique because some of these actors seem to be playing the opposite of their persona. Its fun to watch! But I did find that the dialogue grew old with characters stepping on each others lines which is what happens when actors improvise. Another thing that I found tiresome after a while was Josh Brolin as one of the gay cops as he butts into Mel and Nancy's marriage without any respect at all. I kept expecting Mel to finally tell this guy to mind his own business. Film has a low budget feel and the cinematography is really not very good. It looks like a docu-drama and for a film thats shot at various places of this country it doesn't have one good shot in any location. David O. Russell is a good filmmaker and I thought Spanking the Monkey was a very interesting film and while I did enjoy this comedy, I wish it had more of a focal point. Mel and Nancy decide that they should be together but how did they arrive at this conclusion? Witty dialogue and some eyebrow raised casting make this entertaining to watch but I wish Russell had a more serious intent.

However when he finds that the agency has made a mistake it sparks a wider search for his real parents.I taped this film because I have seen several other films by the same director and wanted to give this a shot on the strength of those works.  I knew it was a comedy but had no other notion what it was about.  At first the plot is worrying because it looks like a dumb road trip movie, however the characters and plot ensure it is more than just that.  The plot is basically nothing more than a device for the characters to be themselves and provide the comedy themselves rather than just trough action.  The comedy does also work through actions but many of the characters are well enough written to be funny within themselves.The acting is good on the whole.  Stiller gives his usual performance that will be familiar to anyone who has seen Cable Guy, Meet The Parents etc.  Arquette is OK and Leoni is sexy if pretty uninteresting.  Jenkins steals every scene he is in as the uptight cop.  And on that point, how very refreshing to see gay characters in a comedy who aren't flaming stereotypes!  Alda, Tomlin, Tyler Moore and Segal are all hilarious in their parental roles and do much more than just provide famous faces.Overall I found this to be very amusing if not hilarious.

Both basically have different versions of the same theme; trying not to be too embarrassed while meeting people who are about to be part of your family.  This movie is just so light hearted with such colorful but realistic characters that it was impossible for me not to just absolutely enjoy.  While Meet the Parents seemed to be more about forcing it's main character into public humiliation (which is something I don't find very amusing), this film allows a little bit of embarrassment to every character, and as a result the characters grow and understand each other.  The plot twists because of how the characters would naturally react to a situation and not just for the fact of creating more laughs.  There's a strong comedic balance here that makes you have actual care for the characters.  I'm not sure why there aren't more films made like this, that don't rely on too many sight gags and bathroom jokes and just allow the personalities move the plot.  After getting to know the people in this film, I wanted to watch the film go on for ages, just as I do all great comedies.  To be fair, the ending did seem to come out of nowhere, but the ending didn't seem to happen too quickly.  We are given a few quick shots afterward showing the lives of the characters after the end of the story occurs.  The film also has a bit of a fate's destiny forcing the main characters together, and that, by the end, there are some firm yet awkward relationships that will repair themselves and create some larger family.  Anyway, I'm just rambling.I saw THREE KINGS not too long ago, and I'm surprised by how diverse of a writer/director David O. Russell is.  He appears to take a little longer than most directors in coming out with new movies, but it's easy to understand why when the films he makes are so different from one another.

Russell proves SPANKING THE MONKEY was no fluke with this movie, which may push the bad taste envelope, but unlike others (are you listening Bobby and Peter Farrelly?), knows bad taste alone does not a movie make.  You also need humor and people to care about, and this movie provides it in spades.  There are so many genuinely funny scenes here it's hard to list them all, but my favorite would probably be when the FBI agent played by Richard Jenkins is accidently given LSD and takes a trip he never expected.Ben Stiller and Patricia Arquette are the two leads here, and they do fine work, but the real treat is the supporting cast.  You might just dismiss the casting of Mary Tyler Moore and George Segal as Stiller's adoptive parents, and Alan Alda and Lily Tomlin as Stiller's real parents as just stunt casting, but they go beyond that to be funny.  Moore is especially good as a pushy mom, being 180 degrees away from her TV image.  Tea Leoni is probably best known for a lousy TV sitcom, but she proved she had genuine comedic talent here as Tina, the adoption agency worker.  As one critic up here pointed out, what makes Tina funny is (1) she's tall, (2) she's clumsy, and (3) she has no sense of humor about either of those traits.  And what makes it work is she isn't self-conscious at all, but throws herself right into the character.  And finally, Jenkins is quite a surprise; though he's a good character actor, I had no idea he was this funny.  All in all, hysterical! "},{"Title":"A disaster!

I think I laughed hardest at TÃ©o Leone with her long legs like an ostrich striding to get away from a crazed truck driver. She had to look elegant even when her life was at stake.One of the themes is adultery, just what constitutes adultery, and what you should do about it both as adulterer and adulteree. Poor Ben breaks in on a very handsome man licking his bored wife's armpit. How should he react? Etiquette books don't cover this.It is a very gay friendly movie given that in was made in 1996. Homosexuality is treated as just one more comic opportunity. The two gay characters are quite far from the stereotypes. That treatment was refreshing and funny.It is a bit of a sloppy movie, but it is fun just the same.

There really isn't much wrong with this movie... only that it could have been even funnier. Sadly this movie has no visual, nor audible characteristics. Pretty much all this movie is about, is the comedy (and relationships). The comedy itself though never is too silly. That is the real strengths of the movie. Even though Characters are totally extreme, they don't feel absolutely unrealistic. That is very unusual for a Hollywood comedy movie.- I found it refreshing.

How in heaven's name were these actors able to keep a straight face making this? Tea Leoni, especially, greets each new disaster with insincere mortification so effectively that it is the movie's best running gag.To recap, Ben Stiller is a husband, new father and adopted son of archetypely loud and &#x15;quarrelsome Jewish New York parents George Segal and Mary Tyler Moore. Ben wants to find his roots, i.e., birth parents. He has enlisted the help of adoption case worker Tea Leoni, whose somber professional manner conceals incompetence of colossal proportions.So begins a road movie as Ben, Tea and Ben's wife, played by a physically lush Patricia Arquette, and their baby set out on the quest, which seems simple at first. What they are actually plunging into is an incredibly complicated unfolding of an adopted child's real history.There's no point in going into the plot in more depth. Suffice it to say that no sooner does one set of crazy people, all of whom seem perfectly normal at first, exit the movie than a new set of crazy people pops up.Favorite scene? I'd have to say LSD guide Lilly Tomlin trying to talk down an LSD-lit-up Richard Jenkins. The destruction of the post office comes in a close second. Oh, but wait, there's the armpit-licking scene. And ... I give up. David O. Russell, the writer/director, take a bow.

Russell made a ramshackle screwball farce back in 1996 that's well worth revisiting on DVD, at least until his next film comes along. He was able to blend character-driven humor with moments of pure slapstick as he tracks the misadventures of Mel Coplin, a neurotic entomologist on a frantic search for his birth parents to resolve his long-standing issues with identity. Tina Kalb, a leggy, off-kilter adoption agency worker thinks she's found Mel's mother in San Diego, so Mel, Tina, and Mel's sweetly frumpy wife Nancy, nursing their five-month baby, embark on a journey that becomes ever more haphazard with every turn of events. Unsurprisingly, an attraction develops between Mel and Tina, who is anxious to get pregnant herself. They meet a gallery of eccentric characters in what becomes a memorably wacky road trip. The real coup with this under-appreciated film is the casting. Long before he sold himself up the river with execrably witless comedies like Meet the Fockers and The Heartbreak Kid, Ben Stiller was a promising actor of relative subtlety, and he expertly mans the rudder as Mel with his skittish self-containment. An actress who never seems to fulfill her potential, TÃ©a Leoni brings a mix of klutziness and sexy smarts to the incompetent Tina. As Nancy, Patricia Arquette has a soft, fuzzy quality that makes a nice contrast to Leoni's angularity.Russell was smart to cast four veterans as Mel's two sets of parents. As his adoptive parents, George Segal and a cast-against-type Mary Tyler Moore are hilarious playing classic New York Jewish stereotypes. Moore, in particular, has a field day playing the obnoxious dark side of Rhoda Morgenstern rightfully proud of her unsagging breasts. As the couple who turn out to be Mel's real parents, Alan Alda and Lily Tomlin are equally funny as graying New Mexico hippies heavy into their art and LSD. When Mel meets them, that's when the film becomes a whirlwind, Noises Off-type of farce with all the personal shenanigans coming to a head. Playing a gay couple who happen to be FBI agents, a surprisingly deft Josh Brolin (No Country for Old Men) and the always dependable Richard Jenkins (superb in this year's The Visitor) shine as bickering personality opposites. Glenn Fitzgerald as Mel's psychotic brother and Celia Weston as a Reagan-loving Southern matron round out a razor-sharp cast. It all ends rather abruptly, but Russell shows a genuine talent for juggling a lot of comic possibilities with supple dexterity. The 2004 Collector's Edition DVD is light on extras - just three deleted scenes, a few outtakes that don't compare to the final film, and a brief featurette on the film's development and production. "},{"Title":"The cleverly pompous humor of Russell's writing shines on screen...","Date":"23 October 2006","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" David O. Russell's imaginative story of the farce trip of 'Flirting with Disaster,' though highly implausible, is hysterically spontaneous and profusely funny. Unlike most of Hollywood's comedic productions, which rely solely on absurdity rather than content, 'Disaster' blends legitimate tension with steady humor, amounting to one of the funniest and most enjoyable films of the year. Russell's script is sharply written, allowing viewers to identify with its characters, even as they come upon outlandish misfortunes &#150;- to which their approach is often more ludicrous than the matter at hand. Mel Coplin (Ben Stiller) was an adopted child. Now married, he and his wife Nancy (Patricia Arquette) set out to find his birth-parents, with the help of adoption counselor Tina (Tea Leoni). With their infant child, who has yet to be named due to Mel's emotional strain of not knowing his biological parents, they hit the road for the truth behind his family ties, on a wild cross-country duck hunt that would leave them with a couple of gay government agents, two wrecked rental cars, marital uncertainties and one gigantic headache. The cleverly pompous humor of Russell's writing shines on screen, with great comedic performances from the whole cast, especially veteran actresses Mary Tyler Moore and Lily Tomlin. The film is well-directed and it's editing, done by Christopher Tellefsen (The People vs. Larry Flynt, Capote), is clean-cut and thorough, making 'Disaster' a quality movie experience as well as a goofy one. For those who love the genre's best in mishap and mayhem, 'Flirting with Disaster' won't be hard-pressed to generate its due share of laughs.

Laughed myself silly and believed it one of the funniest films ever. I bought the video soon after and watched it, but hadn't seen it in about 9 years now I guess. Anyway, I remembered how much I loved it and wondered if it would have held up over time. Seems to have. I didn't remember it being quite so self- conscious as it was and so greatly wishing that it was a Woody Allen, all-neurotic-all-the- time film, but still, the pratfalling and unending humiliations and embarrassment is hilarious and the cast is wonderful. I liked Tea Leoni when she had her sitcom (better than 99% of anything else out there then or now), The Naked Truth and this again reminds us why. Patricia Arquette is wonderfully sober, the straight man in this whole affair, if there is one. I would love to see the out-takes from this film; I wonder if they're on the DVD-or even if it's ---on--- DVD yet because it would seem that keeping a straight face while everything gets crazier and crazier would lead to some serious laughter off-camera. Mary Tyler Moore, George Segal, Lily Tomlin, Alan Alda, all immensely game and really really funny, as are the gay FBI agents whose names elude me. And of course Stiller is practically twisted inside out, he's so neurotic. Russell's Three Kings was a great departure, and equally wonderful, film. Haven't seen I Heart Huckabees although it looked a little precious. Haven't seen Spanking the Monkey although it looked really funny too. This, however, is a wonderfully original and nervously energetic comedy. While I might have criticized it initially, that was really simply by way of comparing my reaction to the film now as to nine years ago. A very very funny film.

Nowhere else can us bastard daughters and sons go to find an irreverent and uproarious look at the uncertainty, confusion, general malaise, and fantasy labyrinth we enter when considering who we are and from whence/whom we came. This film is one of the many other sides to depictions like Blossoms in the Dust of Greer Garson fame (based loosely on the Edna Gladney story).Mel's dilemma is like so many - adoptive mom and dad are strange, and he's not sure where he fits in, but what to do with the unknown, especially after you know it?
