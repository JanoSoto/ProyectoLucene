Like `Survivor,' the name of the game here is, well...survival; but with one significant difference from any of the shows you've seen on television  The winner in `Series 7, The Contenders,' written and directed by Daniel Minahan, will be the only one from among the contestants still standing at the end of the show, meaning `alive.'  Yes, that's right, the object of the game here is to eliminate the opposition, as in `kill' them-- by whatever method available.  Guns, knives, bombs, blunt instruments, anything goes; whatever it takes to do in the other guy (or gal).  And it ain't over till it's over, which means when five are dead, and only one remains.  Of the six in contention this week, the returning champion, with ten kills to her credit, is 30ish Dawn Lagarto (Brooke Smith), who also happens to be eight months pregnant.  She'll be pitted against Connie Trabucco (Marylouise Burke), a nurse; Tony Reilly (Michael Kaycheck) a husband and father of three; Franklin James (Richard Venture), the oldest of the bunch; teen Lindsay Berns (Merritt Wever); and finally, Jeffrey Norman (Glenn Fitzgerald), an ex-boyfriend of Dawn's, who has his own reasons for being in the game.  And so it begins; and the question now is, of the six, which will become the hunters, and which the hunted?  Does Dawn stand a chance of putting five more notches on her scorecard?  Or this week, will one of the other five prevail, and walk away with the cash?  Or, more notably, be the `one' who is able to do so.It was inevitable that this film-- or one like it-- would be made, given the way television has been saturated with `reality,' the past few years.  And since it had to happen, at least it was born of, evolved and guided by the artistic capabilities of Minahan, who has crafted and delivered a gripping, thought provoking satire that reaches it's apex of effectiveness hours, or even days, after the film has ended; because for anyone with any scruples at all, this film will linger in the memory like a phosphene caused by rubbing the eye, and it'll take that long to even begin to sort out the myriad implications of it all.  The obvious question/message of the film is, of course, just how far should/could/can society go in this direction before realizing the consequences of the moral turpitude `reality' shows must necessarily embrace to be successful.  Minahan does not moralize overtly, however; rather, he very subtly plants the suggestion of what the next step in real life may be within the matter-of-fact presentation and context of his story.  And he does it with such precision that it is not until much later that the full impact of it hits you, and it's then that you understand how extremely appalling and depraved the concept is when extrapolated to the nth degree, as Minahan so aptly illustrates here.  Minahan's approach may be more clever than imaginative, as his film plays out as if it were lifted from the negative of `Survivor' or one of it's clones.  But it's cleverness at it's best.  A film cannot seem this true-to-life and entirely natural without a lot of hard work that includes technical knowledge, an eye for detail and an impressive grasp of human nature; Minahan didn't just walk onto the set one day and crank out such an accurate duplication of a `reality' show.  It begins with the astute insights Minahan weaves so incisively throughout his screenplay, and culminates in the way he translated it all to the screen.  Watching this film is something akin to watching Jim Carrey early in his career doing Henry Fonda, or Kevin Spacey doing Christopher Walken or Pacino; it's the kind of professional impersonation/interpretation that just doesn't get any better.What makes it so enthralling is that Minahan so succinctly captures that documentary look and feel of what has become a `genre' of television, and like the best of them, he lets you get to know the contestants-- through interviews and `mini-bios'-- before the bloodbath begins, so that you can pick your favorites and put your money on the one you think has what it takes to win.  He creates a genuine `sporting event' atmosphere, which works at the time-- it puts you in the moment and draws you into the action-- but in retrospect, it makes all that has transpired and everything you've witnessed seem even more disconcerting (which is, of course, the idea).  And you realize, finally, that you've been duped into accepting the unacceptable, and moreover, made to believe by some perverse rationalization of thought that it was all right; which in itself is a keen observation of the power of the medium through which it is proffered.To make the `reality' convincing, the performances, of course, had to be convincing; and they are.  Minahan extracts precisely what was needed from his actors to really sell the show, beginning with Brooke Smith's portrayal of Dawn.  This is the central character of the film, so it was imperative that she be especially believable, and Smith pulls it off beautifully.  As you watch her, you never get the feeling that you're watching an actor; in keeping with the documentary feel of the film, this is Dawn, a young, pregnant woman involved in a game of killing for cash.  it's a solid performance, the kind of which is often overlooked or taken for granted precisely because it is so natural.  The supporting cast includes Donna Hanover (Sheila), Angelina Phillips (Doria), Nada Despotovich (Michelle) and Alex Yershov (Nathan).  To call this film pure entertainment would be wrong; to call `Series 7, The Contenders' an entertaining indictment against moral sense and sensibility, however, would be accurate.  It's one that's definitely going to make you stop and think; and consider.  7/10.

Set in the near future, SERIES 7 is cleverly constructed as a marathon of seventh-season episodes of The Contenders, a hit reality show in which contestants are selected via state lotteries and given guns with which they're expected to hunt down and kill their fellow contestants (although they're free to use their own weapons and be inventive). The object to stay alive. The prize whoever remains alive after 3 Contenders seasons wins his/her freedom from the high-rated program/ordeal. The champ is Dawn Lagarto (Brooke Smith of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS), a pregnant, troubled but essentially decent drifter. Trapped in the program for the past two seasons, Dawn's reluctantly willed herself into becoming a frighteningly efficient killing machine to keep herself and her unborn baby alive. For her third and final season, The Contenders sends Dawn to her hometown of Newbury, Connecticut. Her fellow contestants/adversaries include prim but ruthless ER nurse Connie (Marylouise Burke of MUST LOVE DOGS and A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION); teenage Lindsay, whose well-meaning but overbearing parents (Mom is played by Donna Hanover, TV personality and Rudy Giuliani's ex!) coach her for the show as if she were trying out for an athletic competition; unemployed asbestos-removal worker Tony, who's trying to use this cruel TV twist of fate to unite his family; crazed conspiracy theorist Franklin; and Jeff, an artist who's dying of testicular cancer -- and who also happens to be Dawn's high school sweetheart. The lingering flames of love and resentment between these two, and the reactions of Jeff's long-suffering wife, provide the film's most poignant and suspenseful moments, as well as one of its funniest clips of the low-budget student film they made in high school, including every 1980s video clich√© imaginable and Joy Division's technodirge Love Will Tear Us Apart on the soundtrack. SERIES 7's authentically television-like feel is augmented by its story being told entirely through such TV conventions as bumpers, interviews, voiceovers, cutaway footage, dramatic re-enactments of events by doubles, and exciting tag lines (Real people...in real danger...in a fight for their lives!). We even meet most of the characters as they're notified of their selection for The Contenders on-camera, as the show's masked, armed minions come to the new contestants' homes like sinister Publishers Clearing House representatives. These TV gimmicks create deliciously satirical overtones in and of themselves, and yet the movie's irony and gallows humor works precisely because it's all played absolutely straight, not with the nudge nudge wink wink air that too many recent thrillers have overdone in their attempts to be edgy and postmodern. But the film's brilliant craftsmanship wouldn't be nearly as effective without the power of the fine cast's performances, particularly Brooke Smith; her riveting performance makes Dawn the emotional center of SERIES 7 THE CONTENDERS. That said, the film also chillingly portrays the way fear and self-preservation can turn even the most decent human being into a stone-cold killer. This sharp, smart, exhilarating thriller works on so many levels, and it's got one of the niftiest twist endings in ages, too! Somehow, I suspect it's only a matter of time before a real-life reality show figures out a way to go this far... -) "},{"Title":"A sensational satire","Date":"12 May 2006","Score":"7 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Thriller","Review":" I don't know about you but I'm pretty much 'realitied' out. If I see another behind the scenes, fly on the wall or real people confined to a televisual prison program I think I might well have to tear up my TV licence... and with Big Brother 7 (I think) on its way here in England that might well happen (although, now that I think of it, BB 7 might well end up sharing some unintentional similarities with Series 7 of the Contenders... more on this shortly).To tell the truth, I have never liked any reality TV shows. Instead of showing you something positive they seem to rejoice in the negative and encourage only the worst sort of backstabbing, vindictive and childish behaviour we should be discouraging, rather than rewarding. Unfortunately the trend doesn't look to be slowing down any time soon and this is a very worrying possibility.In recent years there has been a counteract against the reality TV boon, best personified cinematically in Battle Royale (which is close if not quite a reality TV satire) and, bang on the money, Series 7 the Contenders (henceforth Series 7). There are other voices of sanity out there, particularly in books (see Ben Elton's Dead Famous for a brilliant example), which seek to satirise reality television, but only the medium itself can really show us where the end will finally happen, television and real life of course...Series 7 represents a logical step in reality TV. With audiences losing interest in physical and psychological hardship of volunteers, an alternative will have to be found. Therefore why not have a lottery based killing game where five people, along with a sixth champion of the previous game, must compete to slay each other within the limits of a small town in American. As I'm sure you can guess, this barbaric program has yet to be made but it is highly likely that television executives have thought long and hard about the possibilities... it wouldn't take a genius to think of the boost in ratings that, for example, Death Row inmates given a chance to win their freedom if they kill five of their fellow cons in some sort of last man standing style battle royal. Those men would all be scheduled to die anyway, so why not make it for entertainment rather than just justice...? Such a possibility, very fortunately, hasn't yet come to fruition, nor am I aware of any attempts to do so, but one only has to imagine such a show to see that it would be very possible to make it and, moral concerns aside, it really would sweep all before it for audience popularity.Series 7 represents such a program to the nth degree and, very accurately, portrays the emotions a disparate group of the lottery 'winners' might feel upon being selected. I won't dwell on the film itself, simply because I don't want to spoil the humour and utterly spellbinding violence it creates, particularly the juxtaposition of both aspects... you find yourself giggling at an 8 month pregnant woman's attempts to psych out a 50 year old nurse, only to feel the laughter die in your throat as the same woman garrotes, drowns and shoots three people, amongst others, seconds later...The closeness of Series 7 to the formats of other 'reality' shows is striking, from the hideous melodrama, 'I'm going to win' speeches and sad, pathetic individuals more needing sympathy and a bit of cash than the fame they crave. When this is held up alongside the same people brutally killing each other it makes for a very real and chilling portrayal of reality television, particularly in America though by no means limited to that country. These people don't have to fight. They don't have to kill each other. THey certainly don't have to put up with being videoed, attached to GPS monitors and hooked up to microphones 24/7. If it was me I'd blow the cameraman away and go from there... but these people obey the rules of the game, even though the show purports to have no rules, and hence are hostages in a very real sense.This is best demonstrated by the subtle allusions to the fact that the game may well be fixed. By a staggeringly remote chance, Dawn (the pregnant woman) ends up face to face with a former school friend... one of the competitors claims the show is faked... one man suffers a 'self inflicted stab wound to the back' while fleeing... and footage of various situations disappears and must be 're-enacted' by actors. These are just some of the issues mentioned but, as we are supposedly watching the TV show rather than a film about the show, the details aren't explored, which is a place the film falls down a little. Other problems are the TV gimmicks, like sudden 'what will happen next?' montages every 10 minutes or so. Sure, this would happen on TV, but in a film (I saw this at the cinema) it gets quite annoying. However, these quibbles are mostly minor. Anyone who is addicted to reality TV shows and people who genuinely despise them will find something here, although they might not like what they see. As for the Series 7 scenario...? Just how implausible do you think it is? I only ask because, in one of the series of Big Brother in Australia, one of the 'cast,' while making out with another member of the cast, asked her whether she was excited. When she gave her answer he then picked up a knife and held it to her throat.'How about now?' he wondered. This man was subsequently taken out of the BB house but the question remains... how far will TV executives go with reality TV? Series 7 the Contenders shows us the depths to which it could stoop eerily accurately.

The main thing that makes the movie's premise work is that the movie takes itself seriously. It's similar to Christopher Guest's mockumentary style in that the people in the movie are for the most part unaware of their own ridiculousness. Now, that being said the acting in the movie is excellent. There is very nice character development of the main characters, and Brooke Smith's character has to be the most appealing and interesting assassin I've seen on screen ever. Most importantly, the movie is presented exactly like a reality show which eventually draws the viewer into suspending their disbelief and accepting the ludicrous world these characters inhabit. Even the bad parts of reality shows are accurate, the narrator's overly dramatic voice, the cheesy melodramatic music to inject some false drama, the corny stock footage of the flying bird. It's all so accurate it's wickedly funny. It even parodies cop shows during a car chase. Finally, the icing on the cake is that as ridiculous as everything is, you realize that American society isn't too far off from this extreme today, and that gives the film the added bite of seriousness that propels it above being simply entertaining and makes it a true satire, This film is even more impressive considering the fact that the idea was conceived 5 years ago before the reality craze began.I encourage people to watch Series 7 once, it's destined to become a cult classic. The last line of the movie is also laugh-out-loud funny.

Spoiler Warning if you haven't seen this or don't want it spoiled, stop reading here. This film is supposed to be three half-hour episodes of a reality-TV series stitched together in a marathon format, a la some of the Cops or Real World marathons that come around from time to time. This mock reality series called The Contenders or Series 7 (or both?) involves 6 people, chosen at random by their government numbers, who must kill the others in order to become the champion.Mocking reality TV in this way could have been pretty high-concept stuff, but the execution failed to live up to the vision. The acting is so-so and the plot just doesn't seem to get there. It just sort of peters out at about 85%. The director didn't seem to be able to decide if he was going to mock reality TV, or if he was going to parody it, and that failure to decide is evident throughout. Either one would have been interesting, but the fence-straddling compromises the entire production. The director tried to include too many ideas, and at some point it just wears thin. Reality TV is such an easy mark -- even when this was still in production -- that a more subtle touch would have worked better. Frankly, for dystopian future television programs, The Running Man is a far more interesting and well-executed idealization, and less dated than one might think, given that it's sort of long in the tooth by now. Delusions in Modern Primitivism is a better mockumentary about how we are voyeurs to self-destruction.Don't waste your time with Series 7 The Contenders. Watch Network or Delusions or Running Man, any one of those is more satisfying.

The premise of the reality show is that the contestants are given weapons and have to murder each other in order to win. The contestants include a mentally insane man living in a trailer park, a cancer patient, a religious nurse, a high school teenager, a middle-aged father, and (the reigning champion) a pregnant woman. The film is structured as a marathon showing and is played as a series of episodes strung together each following these contestants. The film depicts these people as normal and everyday people who are forced into this terrible situation against their will, but the real meat of the film comes in when we get to learn about the histories of some of these characters. That's the point of the film where the film grows out of being a spoof of reality shows and begins to manifest into a social commentary. The high school teenager has parents who encourage her every step of the way and help her suit up for the murders that she is about to commit. The pregnant woman has been disowned by her own mother due to past incidents. The middle-aged parent has his own troubles at home. There's a lot more going on here than at first glance. This is an angry and dark satire that really challenges some of the concepts of reality and the satire of itself.There's a lot here that I truly admire. For starters, the performances. They are pretty awful in a way that, at times, seems cringe-worthy. However, when you take a look at reality television shows such as Survivor and The Real World, the acting in those is even worse. It's supposed to be reality, yet the people in them are not believable. That's what makes reality television such a joke, and so in a roundabout way of saying things the performances here are good because the actors are good at capturing the melodramatic mannerisms of the contestants at large. I particularly enjoyed the performance of Brooke Smith as the pregnant woman. She is ridiculously cold and cruel and monstrous, and you can really feel the bitterness that she feels. Yet her mannerisms are so sarcastic and almost pathetic. The same goes for the rest of the cast, but Smith has a visual presence to her that I've always admired. She's a terrific actress. Nobody can forget her performance as the kidnapped victim in The Silence of the Lambs. I've seen some of her television work as well and she almost always sticks out in a good way. Merritt Wever and Glenn Fitzgerald do an equally good job as the teenage girl and the cancer patient, the former being the most likable person in the cast and the latter having all of the best lines and being the most interesting of all the characters.My favorite thing about this film, however, has to be the momentum of it. Series 7 The Contenders is almost never boring and there's always something going on. It's virtually impossible to stop watching once you've started, even if you pick up in the middle of it. I think this was done intentionally. I think a lot of televisions shows have that same kind of watchability factor, and what I appreciated the most about this film is that there were no commercials that cut into the action. The satire of the film itself is simple and clever, but even if you put all that aside, you still have one hell of a captivating film. Putting the climax of the film aside, you do get to care about almost all these characters and you don't particularly want to see any of them die really.If you want my personal opinion on the film, I cannot say that I like it too much. I don't personally find the film itself to be very funny. I like dark humor, but I thought that this was too sick, really, to be funny. I also really don't like the ending. It felt like I was being beaten over the head by the satire. I also find that the film itself isn't exactly re-watchable. Once you know how it all ends, you really don't have any desire to ever really sit down and watch it. There are films out there that are sick and that you never really WANT to watch again, but at the same time you feel you should and can't help but feel the need to sit through it, but Series 7 The Contenders plays all of it's cards in one sitting and as a result you really don't feel any desire to absorb any of it. It's more the type of film that you just appreciate rather than like and enjoy. I can imagine a lot of horror fan and readers of Fangoria would love it to pieces or at least get a huge kick out of watching it. In my opinion, as brilliant and as clever as it is, I definitely wouldn't advise mainstream moviegoers to watch this. I thought it was a brilliantly directed film in a lot of ways, and the satire was effective, but I can't exactly recommend it. I'm glad I saw it though.

Big Brother had aired in the summer of 2000 and dominated the tabloids while Pop Idol and Survivor both debuted the following year to equal success. But the backlash was already beginning and it started with this razor-sharp parody that took the genre to its logical conclusion. But this doesn't just illustrate the problems with reality TV - it shines a light on the depraved, fame-hungry individuals who will literally do anything in order to get on TV for their fifteen minutes of fame. Catching up with it again today, I was reminded not only of how far ahead of its time it was but also how scarily accurate it was. One suspects that it's only a matter of time before such a chilling scenario appears for real.The film is presented as a series-long broadcast of a show called The Contenders in which five randomly chosen people are each given a gun and thrown into a battle to the death with the sixth entry, the winner of the previous series. For this, the seventh series, current champion Dawn (Brooke Smith) is heavily pregnant and determined to be victorious again as her freedom is due once she wins. Returning to her hometown, she is pitched into battle with college student Lindsay (Merritt Wever), unemployed thug Tony (Michael Kaycheck), Christian nurse Connie (Marylouise Burke), paranoid conspiracy theorist Franklin (Richard Venture) and cancer patient Jeff (Glenn Fitzgerald). As the series progresses and the body count rises, each contestants secrets are revealed in front of the nation. Will Dawn survive for the sake of her unborn child or will another of the Contenders take her crown? Series 7 The Contenders is a spot-on parody of the countless shows of this nature that pollute our screens on a daily basis. Writer/director Daniel Minahan's use of graphics and narration (provided by Will Arnett) perfectly apes the genre so well that you have to remind yourself that it is a movie and not an actual show. The mostly unknown cast also add to the illusion that this is really happening - Smith's foul-mouthed mother-to-be is a brilliant character and you root for her throughout, even if her morals are somewhat twisted. But then again, this feels like a slightly different America - when she blows away an old guy at a cash desk, few of the other people present bat an eyelid because they see the TV cameras there and realise it's a show. And without meaning to, the movie also parodies those desperate souls who wish to partake in these ridiculous shows. No detail is too graphic and no secret is too big to be splashed in front of the cameras, all for the sake of entertainment. I loved the moment when the previously loyal Lindsay confronts her pushy parents and even stabs one of them and then, seconds later, she's expressing her undying love for them. The film reeks of hypocrisy, as it should. It leaves the same nauseating taste in your mouth that most reality shows do.There will be some who don't get the joke, probably those people who believe that the likes of The Only Way Is Essex and I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here! are documentaries. But I can't stand these reality shows which have about as much reality in them as a Mark Rothko exhibition. Series 7 The Contenders remains a solid and stark reflection on a subculture of TV and TV viewers that have abandoned reason and logic in the pursuit of audience numbers, even if it smashes the point home over and over again. The movie does have a very strong 'indie' feel to it (or 'low budget' if you're being unkind) and it's impossible to listen to Joy Division again without thinking of the movie. But I have a lot of respect for this movie and would recommend you try and watch it. And whatever you do, please keep telling yourself that it's just a movie...

Five of the contenders are newly, randomly chosen people who are pulled from a lottery. They are handed a gun as a way of welcoming them into the show. The sixth contender is the winner from the previous season of the show. It is the Hunger Games before the Hunger Games even existed. Although the contenders aren't necessarily children, young people are not ruled out of the lottery. For instance, one of the contenders in the show is a 17 year old girl. The movie goes from being darkly hilarious to just plain dark as the show's contests show no mercy in killing the other one, no matter who they are.Shot mockumentary style, the movie is very fun and constantly keeps the audience on the edge of their seat; there's no telling what's going to happen next, who's going to die, or who's going to eventually come out on top.

Well, what we would have in this movie, and to be honest with you, if you gave everybody in Big Brother guns and turned the house into a shooting gallery, I would still not watch it, and not because I don't like violence, but because I find these shows really boring.In fact, I found this movie really boring. There was simply way too much D&M (deep and meaningfuls) in this film to keep me at all interested, and the fact that these characters were all fictional, sort of, not actually did, make the D&Ms all that more pointless and painful to sit through. In a way the violent scenes are few and far between, and even then that stupid voice over makes it even worse.Okay, yes, I understand that the whole idea of this film was to speculate on where society was heading with its craze for reality-TV, and it is not like society has not been there before. Ancient Rome was famous for its blood sports, and the gladiatorial arena did not have foul conduct rules. Basically you were given a sword and told to kill the other gladiator, or, if the audience simply wanted blood, throwing some unarmed prisoner into a pit full of wild animals and see who won.Actually, public executions have been a form of entertainment for quite a while, and in many cases still are. When somebody is executed on death row, apparently there is an audience (though you can't actually buy tickets for it). Granted this film may be a little far fetched, but still, it is really, really, boring.

It's filmed as a marathon of episodes. The writer/director, having worked as a TV producer, has some insightful and critical things to say about the direction of modern entertainment.I liked many aspects of the movie. It brought to mind other cult satires, such as Man Bites Dog and Videodrome. The acting was pretty good. The actors had to be very naturalistic, and I think they pulled it off well. The indie soundtrack was generally pretty annoying, though I guess indie fans will probably love it. The in-universe TV producers dig up an embarrassing short movie set to Love Will Tear Us Apart, which I found utterly hilarious (and spot on for artsy losers in the 1980s, not that I could possibly identify with it). The movie itself mixes reality TV camera work, interviews, and dramatic re-enactments. Throughout, a rather dark picture is painted of the country, the TV crew, and the in-universe audience. It's revealed that the TV show manipulates contestants, as well as leaving open many questions about corruption and implied fascism.The highly cynical take on TV, culture, and society will probably turn off some people, but if you like cynical satire, you'll probably love this.

This mockumentary hits the vein that The Running Man touched on so many years ago.  We have six contenders randomly selected to slay each other(I think that producers know full well who its going to boil down to, even in a field of 100 or so).  We end up with a teenager, an old man, an unemployed family man, a nurse, a pregnant girl, and her now married, cancerous ex begging for death.  Issued 9mm pistols, they hunt each other down.  There are also side stories to each player, giving it an Osbournes on drugs feel(wait a sec, that IS the Osbournes).  That said, here is the review.  I just loved it.  If I hadn't known it was a movie, I would have believed it was a real tv show.  Everyone had personalities and showed they weren't just monsters out to kill anything in sight, though they definitely acted like animals, resorting to anything BUT the 9mms they were issued.  It makes you wonder how society will get if reality tv keeps going.  Perhaps we will have a tag game where points are given out based on whether you wasted them with a rocket launcher or a samurai sword, maybe a million dollars if you killed them with a plastic billy club(assuming you live long enough to enjoy the money).  It also makes you think if producers make sure to get whatever dirt they can on the later survivors of any game like we saw with multimillionaire, joe millionaire, survivor, etc.  Spoiler noteOne gripe I had was with the sniper scene.  Everyone got one but Connie, who orchestrated the meeting with two contenders losing.  If you wanted to generate any suspense, have her get one too.

The target is television reality shows  something that just screams to be satirized.  But, surprisingly, the movie rises above its own obviousness and really twirls off in unexpected directions.  Presented as a marathon from the previous season of episodes, Series 7 The Contenders gives us a (very-near future?)vision of a world in which reality tv has been taken to the extreme-sport-level of actual murder.  These contestants--chosen significantly against their will--stalk each other and fight to the death.  Reigning champion Dawn (the always-exciting Brooke Smith) is back to do battle in her hometown; the fact that she is heavily pregnant gives her mission (and the movie) a depth it wouldn't deserve.  But, despite some serious moments and some serious violence, this is a comedy.  Luckily, it succeeds as such.  While often focusing on the conspicuous joke, Series 7 does so with demented glee; this is blacker-than-black comedy.  An ability to laugh at death is certainly a prerequisite to enjoying the film.  But writer/director Daniel Minahan is best at finding the humor in our national susceptibility to being manipulated--especially when it comes to television.  Some of the most piercingly funny bits are when non-contestant characters react to being part of the drama of the show; I especially love when Dawn's very young niece grabs at her moment in the spotlight (the girl's age also gives the moment a little extra creepiness--this kid knows the tricks already!).  Most viewers will see the little twists coming well before they happen--though there is a goofy surprise at the end--but the dead-on casting makes this a treat to sit through.  Minahan's characters are all distinct, yet all crazed in exactly the same way, so it's fun to see how they react to the demands of the game--and, with the exception of Dawn, patently dig their proverbial 15 minutes of fame.

This season sees five new contestants randomly selected by lottery for the game show. The rules are simple &#150; each contestant is given a gun and a rifle as well as a choice of other weapons and protective gear. From this point they are separated from their families and joined by a camera crew who will shadow them throughout their time in the show. The winner? Well, whoever is left standing when the others are all dead wins their freedom and life.I remember hearing about this show years ago when it came out but I had never seen it being shown anywhere until it popped up on late night television the other week. It is depressing but the film is actually more relevant now than it was then simply because reality shows have continued down the road that they were on when this was made. Of course it has not gone as far as murder-television but with celebs eating bugs, Big Brother causing protests in India and many other extremes it is hard not to appreciate the point the film is making here.The strength of the film is that it accurately recreates the staples of the genre in the repetitive nature of clips, heavy voice-over use, trailers for coming next, interviews with the contestants and so on. Looking at the genre cynically you could say that the show also gets other things right &#150; specifically the manipulation of footage, the way emotional interest in the contestants is falsely generated and of course the way that conflict and fighting is produced to keep the viewer interested. This aspect of it works well and it really does capture the look and feel of the genre, setting it up well to deliver a scathing attack on the genre from the inside.Unfortunately it is here where it falls down somewhat because it is not as sharp or as clever as it would like to think. OK it does the genre as well as any reality show, but the ability to turn this on itself is lacking. Of course the idea appalled me as a viewer and that was the point &#150; that the viewer would question the genre on the basis of this film, but I do not think it asks enough of the audience to make this happen. In fact, once you get over the concept, it can almost be watched as a reality show of sorts and I imagine fans of the genre could easily miss the point of the film &#150; mainly because it doesn't make one that well. It will sound like a strange criticism but I do think that by hitting the genre spot on throughout the film, the result is that it is almost too straight to act as an attack at the same time. Instead it is just an exaggeration and it leaves the viewer to do the work.The cast are OK, no really good performances but they certainly deliver the turns that convince within what I expect from the genre (and I write this as a guilty but unrepentant viewer of America's Next Top Model and a couple of other trashy shows). Smith, Burke, Venture, Wever and Fitzgerald all do well enough without ever threatening to be real characters. The only member of the cast that really stuck in my mind though was Arnett, who turns up in a small role &#150; but he was memorable to me for being Gob in Arrested Development, not for what he did here! Overall then, this is a very convincing extreme version of reality television that remains topical due to the genre becoming more and more extreme and cruel, not the film itself hitting points well. However beyond this design and structure there is not a sharp criticism or message to be had and as a result there is not much of a message other than the obvious one about the path that reality TV is on and why cruelty or suffering of others should be acceptable as entertainment. Topical &#150; but not as sharp or clever as one would have hoped it could have been.

Sheckley later wrote novels around the idea, the first of which (The Tenth Victim) was made into a movie in 1965 - but it's that first short story, predating The Truman Show by forty years, that captures the flavour of reality TV as we know it today.  It's not itself reality TV, of course.  It's a short story.  The Truman Show, by far the best film to deal with reality TV, isn't itself reality TV either.  It's a movie.  The Contenders is different because it ISN'T a movie - at least, not a real movie.  It's yet more reality TV footage, made at a time when we're drowning in the stuff, blown up onto 35mm prints and screened in cinemas.That's ALL it is.  It's important to be clear about this.  Bram Stoker's Dracula consists of (fictional) diary entries, letters, case notes, newspaper clippings and so forth - but when you put the lot together, you find they make a novel.  Some of Woody Allen's best efforts (like Zelig and Sweet and Lowdown) consist entirely or in part of made-up documentary footage - but similarly, when you put all the pieces together, the result is a movie.  No such transformation takes place here.  If you put together segments and out-takes and alternate camera footage from an episode of Temptation Island, you'd most likely end up with yet another episode of Temptation Island; nothing more.  The only difference here is that the reality TV show in question is a fictional one.Yes, this is satire, but that's the problem.  It's the kind of lazy satire that feels it can get away with anything.  If the characters are poorly defined, or the acting is less than convincing, or the camera angles, wrong or the storyline convoluted and overly sensational - no matter, it's all part of the joke.  If anything else had gone wrong, THAT would have been part of the joke, too.

Obviously this is satire, and there are some genuinely funny moments, such as the parents of a teenage contestant urging their daughter on, as, armed with a rifle, she attempts to take care of an elderly opponent on a golf course. When the same girl, taking the gun into a shopping mall, is challenged by a security man, she says `its all right, I'm from The Contenders' and he lets her pass.  The two main characters, Dawn (Brooke Smith) the champion from the last series and Jeffery (Glenn Fitzgerald), an opponent and former boyfriend, are sympathetically drawn. Dawn is pretty aggressive, but also eight months pregnant, and filled with emotion on returning to her home town. Jeffery, an artist, is suffering from testicular cancer, and though cared for by his devoted wife, wants to die. Needless to say, it becomes pretty hard for Dawn to pull the trigger on Jeffery when she gets the chance. The other contestants are not so sympathetically drawn, but they are by no means monsters, even if Connie the ER nurse with the deadly needle, goes to confession before stepping out to kill someone.I formed the distinct impression that the contestants were not actually volunteers, being selected at random from something like the list of social security numbers. If that were the case, and I was selected, my first priority would be to wipe out the producers, not my fellow contestants. The Gladiators of ancient Rome were not volunteers of course, and perhaps that's the parallel the producers of the film seek to draw, or perhaps with the military draft for Vietnam.Occasionally, reality TV makes good television, as in the case of the Australian `RPA' about the day to day workings of a large Sydney hospital. But the contrived ones, like `Survivor', `Boot Camp' and even the quiz show `The Weakest Link' depend on (vicarious) fear and humilation, not to mention voyeurism for their entertainment value. Freak shows such as `Springer' add loathing to the mix.The director here (Daniel Minehan) does a good job of demonstrating just how nasty the premises are behind these sorts of shows but don't really sheet home the blame. I don't mind seeing a few of the high and mighty humiliated in public but I do object to ordinary mostly decent people being chewed up for entertainment purposes. Dawn and Jeffery deserve our sympathy, not our revulsion, a point the film makes reasonably well. It also illustrates that P T Barnum's dictum has lost none of its force.

Each series shows 5 new contenders plus the survivor from the previous series. We follow Series 7, in which the current champion is 8 months pregnant. The conceit of the movie is that we are actually watching the series; it never steps outside itself, and by and large, this works remarkably well. It forces the viewer to observe himself and his own act of viewing; as I watched, I became caught up in the television series, and had to stop myself and say 'waitaminnit, this is a movie.' The parody of reality TV is vicious, and actually much more complicated than at first it appears. The initial reaction is that it's a one-note parody, no different from The Running Man in its dark vision of where reality TV will lead. But it is more than that, showing us how we are manipulated by the images we see, how we become desirous of seeing more, how easy it is to overcome revulsion...no, for revulsion to become part of the pleasure. In the course of it, it also shows the effects of distorting random violence into heroism while still pretending that the rest of our values about violence and justice remain untouched. None of this is heavy-handed or preachy because we are participants; we are tv viewers watching the series, and things are unfolding. No one is talking at the viewer, and when they are, watch out; it's part of the manipulation. The movie didn't try to explain how such a thing became legal, how a television show got the right to randomly select any American citizen and force them to participate. This was a problematic omission, the movie bespeaks a dark future but doesn't have the wit to tell us how we got there. This could easily have been done without breaking the bounds of it's all the show that the movie sets for itself by having it be part of the opening credits.

Reality shows are becoming increasingly more desperate to shock people (witness Fear Factor)...the next obvious step is to kill!  Of course this won't ever happen (I hope) but this film (shot on high-definition video) shows how it might look.The acting is just great...especially Smith and Glenn Fitzgerald as another contestant.  The movie looks and sounds just like any other reality show you might see on TV.  By turns this movie is sad, horrifying, very funny, surprisingly touching...and downright fascinating.

With Big Brother 4 slowly coming to its conclusion, and still nothing of any excitement to actually happen within the house, it was refreshing to see an extreme take on the whole 'Reality TV experience'. The film takes a glimpse at society where a game show involving murder and death is acceptable, and the 'Contenders' even become celebrities. Sound familiar?? The premise screams out The Running man, but the two films couldn't be any more different. The Running man is almost fantasy like, extreme outfits, weapons and cheesy kill off lines, where as Series 7 the contenders gives a pistol to a 8 month pregnant women and lets here walk in to a 7/11 and blow someones head off! Its reality at some level, it all depends on your own perception of reality.The idea behind the film is that a lottery occurs and if your numbers come up, then you have no choice but to enter the game show! Win and you go on to another series, lose and you lose your life. As the contestants do not have a choice in the matter, it makes the show even more ruthless and degrading. The lottery machine doesn't know if your pregnant, have testicular cancer or are a god worshipping nurse. It's got nothing to do with caring, its cold, simplistic and nasty. Live or die, it's up to you. If your expecting to see non-stop carnage, then you will be left waiting, as although there is violence in places, this isnt Ichi the Killer.The film is played out in an episodic fashion, in the style of America's dumbest criminals or Police Camera Action, which breaks the film down into bite size pieces. There are a couple of bits within the film which are quite shocking, but the emotional undertone can creep up on you when your least expecting it. Brooke Smith is fantastic as the reigning champion and mother-to-be, and its a far cry from seeing her rub 'lotion on her skin' in Silence of the Lambs! Glenn Fitzgerald also puts in a great performance and when the two share the screen the emotional past of the two is evident. The other characters are bit parts with none of the other contestants really getting much screen time, yet they all play their part to make one shocking, emotional whole.

That's that part out of the way.I think while most people get the whole how far will reality TV go issue, there are a couple that people miss.The first is the way all the contenders thought all their opponents were sick, psychotic or evil, when they were all in the same boat and doing the same thing. Connie killed a man while he was paralyzed and tricked her opponents to put themselves in a vulnerable situation so she could make easy pickings of them, but then had a go at Dawn for all the people she killed (yes I know she was also having a go at her for her loose morals but it was also about the killing).The other issue raised is the manipulative power of TV. Tony stabbed himself in the back?! I think not! And the whole dramatized ending was ridiculous (from the TV point of view, not as part of the movie). I haven't seen the DVD deleted scenes, but apparently what really happened was very different. Also, I think using 'Love Will Tear Us Apart' at the Final Showdown is another example.

Well, if you found yourself glued to the screen during that moment, you will love The Contenders. It's this brand new reality show and the creators just packaged the entire seventh season and released it on VHS. What are the rules of this new hit series? Well, five contestants are randomly selected, the staff of the show locates them, hands them pistols, and then the game begins. To put it very simply, you win the game by killing the other four people in cold murder before they do the same to you. If you manage to come out on top for three rounds, you get a big cash prize! Oh, and you can't refuse to play. They'll kill you. And you can't commit suicide, because that's against the rules. Now are you ready to hear that this entire show is a crock? Series 7 is really a very well-made satire of all those grisly reality shows the American public loves. It has just about everything to make it seem 'real', from the slick intro to the cheesy voice-over host and even some Real World moments where sappy scenes are paired with love rock ballads. It's also very violent and packed to the brim with language, so if you get queasy at the sight of blood or don't like cursing in your movies, stay far away from Series 7. As for this viewer, I had a great time watching the characters as they battled for the title of champion. Which, what does that say about me or the rest of the people who get sucked into this reality? Does it say we can be shocked by nothing? True, I winced when people's throats were cut and others were shot point blank, but I didn't turn the TV off. So how far can we push the limits of television? These are just a few of the questions raised during a normal viewing of this film. Oh, and there was definitely a creepy conspiracy going on behind the cameras of this show. Contestants coincidentally get injured off camera and are left open to an attack, footage is somehow 'lost' and thus must be dramatized, and an odd string of red letters is supposedly sent to four contestants by the fifth, an elderly nurse. Or were they? I liked this film.

Entertaining originality alert - flee for the hills Hollywood!","Date":"30 August 2002","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Thriller","Review":"  Sigh. It's been too long - an original concept in a movie and not just a twist on a concept. Well it's welcome.The movie is a subversion of all the reality television series plaguing our screens. As there numbers increase, along with their audacity, this movie's parody of them is all the more striking. `The Contenders', now in Series 7, is a television show where a reigning champion is pitted against five members of the public, selected at random from a lottery. Each is given a gun. The winner is the one who lives after winning a number of games. The current contender is the heavily pregnant Dawn, who is going back to her old town where she might actually know some of the competitors. We're then treated to the whole series of this reality drama, run back to back, in a `marathon' run. At no point does the film deviate from pretending to be a TV series, which allows the viewer to get the intended feeling of a show rather than a movie.The characters in this TV `show' are small parodies of the real ones you see. The actors are all well chosen to make you think `where have I seen them before?' - the sort of familiar faces that plaster these shows. There's the introspective one, the energetic one, the determined one, the wild kid, etc. All are played with a touch of the melodrama we too often see in these real people - exaggerated pleas to the camera, extreme spectrums of emotions, and so forth. Dawn's monologues to the camera are strongly reminiscent of shows I've seen before, just done with a hint of mockery that makes me grimly smile. They're all just a little off kilter, a little bit `out there' that you can simultaneously identify them and mock them.The direction of the movie keeps it constantly in tone. There is a definite split in the movie - an episodic feel as we go from episode to episode in the `series 7 marathon'. Each of these splits is accompanied by a hilarious `next time on The Contenders', with clips of whats-to-come. There is a great use of the dramatic and corny tunes that such series have - overly sentimental clich√©d nonsense is shown for exactly what it is. The sheer absurdity of some moments of tenderness (when people are being brutally slaughtered) adds to the delicious black comedy of it all. How can it not be ironic having sweet `I love you' music playing while someone plans to kill? And let's not forget the great `Love Will Tear Us Apart' Joy Division video. If you see the movie you won't forget that - and forever mock pretentious art videos. As they deserve to be mocked.The film isn't flawless. The biggest flaw is that the movie falls into absurdity towards the end. It's quite damaging and ruins the effect of the picture. The situation - the set up - is bizarre enough without the need to build to an overly-climatic confrontation at the end. It's as if the producers felt that the ending wasn't strong enough and pandered to the audience that they are, somewhat, taking the proverbial out of. It makes the movies' powers of parody a lot less effective in the final few minutes and seems forced. Still, up to that, it was an effective commentary on the ridiculous way these shows are heading, and bitingly funny at times in a nihilistic sense. Well worth a watch, but the ending left a distaste in my mouth I couldn't entirely remove. 6.9/10 for the originality aspirations though.

Everything is there from commercial break-type announcements, last-week-on messages, musical cues, and interviews with contestants. Most of the time the coverage was even believable (which is to say, it seems at most times that the footage really came from a videographer following around a contestant). The ending is also a great of commentary, but should not spoil it.Possibly the only failing for Series 7 is its under-examination (if not complete disregard) of the overtly sexually exploitative nature of many of the currently popular reality television shows. The irony here is that the director had actually pitched Series 7 as a television show (for broadcast, but still staged) and decided to seek independent funding for the feature because the network executives wanted more sex and less violence. It's hard to understand exactly why he found violence (with respect to the mass media) to be the topic most appropriate for criticism. Or, rather, it's hard to understand why he would deal exclusively with a critique of violence.Series 7 is definitely one of the most interesting (post modern) pieces of cinema (in quotes as this it was meant for the small screen) released this year.

Unlike the glitzy '10th Victim' from the sixties, which seemed like an excuse to ogle Ursula Andress, it's uncomfortably believable. All the characterizations are superb, and though the digital videography does provide the flavor of television, the anamorphic enhanced DVD reveals that it must have been shot in high-definition video - it's much less grainy than Spike Lee's 'Bamboozled' or Mike Figgis' 'Timecode'.  After a good exposition of all the players, from the midpoint on there are constant surprises.  The violence never seems gratuitous.  The very fact that it feels only mildly absurd is quite an indictment of our current pop culture. One hopes for a prolific future for Mr. Minahan - a brilliant concept, brilliantly executed.

The rest are cineplexes that have nineteen screens and show Harry Potter on five of them.  So I had to wait for video.  For a movie shot on video that's pretending to be a tv show, watching it on video isn't so bad.The movie was going along just fine.  I was enjoying it and reveling in how some one else hates the idea of reality tv as much as I do.  Then there was the extreme violence.  When they started showing the reigning champion and her 'greatest hits,' I almost got sick.  There's just something about shooting on video that gives a movie a brutal honesty to it.  Watching something on film, you feel removed from the action taking place on screen.  But with this, you're right there with them and it's a little disturbing.  If I were to watch it again, I'd probably be able to laugh at the funny parts, but during the fist viewing I was adjusting to the style.As much as I like what the movie has to say, and as much as I did enjoy it, I have reservations about it.  Not because of the violence, but because it was a little redundant.  It really has just one point to make about tv, entertainment and the public's appetite for violence.  It's a satire and it goes on a little long for that.  Instead of putting several episodes together in order to give a movie-length marathon, a short film that contained just one half-hour episode might have been more effective.To combat this problem of the novelty getting old fast, the humor is added.  However, the humor doesn't really seem enough to carry it.  I suppose the real problem is getting the viewer to want to see the story carried out to the end.  And while I was interested in how the story would play itself out, I wasn't affected by it in any tangible way.  I did enjoy the movie and would recommend it for a rental, but I can't look at it with the same awe for originality and enthusiasm as I did with a movie like The Blair Witch Project.

Cracking performances from top acting talent helps, especially the wonderfully demented nurse with the syringe. Every soap opera cliche descends like a diluvium over the proceedings and is handled by the writer/director with ruthless precision.However, an enthymeme like this needs to sustain a certain internal logic. Why would a contender who has just beaten an opponent to death on camera try to suggest to the entire mall that the program is faked? If this was just to set up the next joke, then there is a failure of purpose here. Likewise, would cameramen be prepared to stand so close to a contender when they are in constant danger of being caught in  crossfire? Also the cinema highjack is problematic. The offer that is made to Dawn by the television presenter is no different to the premise of the show already rejected by the lovers in favour of shooting hostages in order to secure their freedom with the baby, so why does she not realise this obvious fact? Admittedly, it is a reconstruction with actors by the television company so it is arguable that we only have their version of events, but it is a weakness in my opinion.However, as the premise is a surreal and unlikely one, the film can be seen as a meditation on fate and hope, and perhaps nature itself. The ending offers the cheeky supposition that the theory of Darwinian natural selection may not be all it's cracked up to be.Hopefully, Daniel Minahan's career will not be the stillborn genesis we've seen so many times before in regard to promising talent.

With its impending DVD release, and the subsequent controversy (translates to free publicity) that is sure to follow it, 'Series 7' is going to become one of the defining films of 2001.  And what a film it is...Crafted as a modern reality television show (and including all of the pop psychology, melodrama, and editing-based cliff-hangers that these shows thrive on), 'Series 7' basically tells the story of eight-months-pregnant Dawn returning to her East Coast hometown to confront her family and her old high school sweetheart.  The residents of her hometown are not exactly delighted to see her (at least not in person!), since for months now they have all witnessed Dawn brutally murdering people on the mega-popular 'Contender' gameshow.  Five hometown residents are particularly concerned with Dawn's return, as they have been assigned by government computers to join Dawn in the 'Contender's' kill-or-be-killed gameshow.  It's survival of the fittest, where the only grand prize is life, and the only parting gift is a bullet in the head.Sounds like a laugh riot, huh!?  Easily one of the funniest films I have seen in a long time, 'Series 7' relies primarily on violence or the preparation for impending violence to elicit laughter from the audience.  And laugh they did!  I have seen only a small number of comedies at the Uptown Theatre, but none was as warmly received as 'Series 7.'  From the opening gunshot to...uh...well, to the closing gunshot, this crowd was in stitches!  So were most of the 'contenders'...Sure, people will complain that this is just American bloodlust at its worst, that somehow violence and humor should never be so directly linked, that this film will inspire violence in the real world, blah, blah, blah.  Well you know what I say to those people!?  Too bad!!  Murder can be damn funny on film and few films pull it off as well as S7.  It also works as a quality satire, critiquing both the constructed reality of television in general and the tropes of reality shows like 'Survivor' and 'Big Brother' in particular.Complaints, you ask?  Surely there must be something to criticize!  Well, every film has its flaws, and S7 is no exception.  A minor issue to be sure, but I think S7 was just a little to restrained when it comes to violence.  We could have used a few additional contestants (meaning a few additional murders) and maybe some more backstory on Dawn's earlier success on 'The Contenders.'All in all, I loved it and I can't wait for the DVD!  Bring on 'Series 8'!  Or even a prequel showing how Dawn got started would be wonderful, as she really is an amazingly sympathetic and entertaining character.*BANG*  *BANG*  *BANG*  Excuse me...do you have any bean dip!? -- Dawn speaking to the clerk in the store where she just murdered S7's first victim.

The crucial element is that the contenders in real-life choose to be contenders for reasons of greed - for fame or money.In Series 7 however, the contenders are chosen by some sort of government sponsored lottery draft-pick.  They have no choice but to take part and kill or be killed.  It might be a good idea but it's nothing to do with the reality genre and has more in common with the Vietnam war. In fact it was written years before Survivor and Big Brother hit our screens.So all we're left with is an invented game show that isn't a satire of anything. As a game show with the appropriate stings, narration, etc it looks convincing.  As a movie, however, it doesn't work.Assuming you manage to get over wondering how and why this show started seven series ago there's still quite a few logic flaws to hurdle.It's very difficult to keep a full-length movie going on such a one-note premise and the screenwriter resorts to credulity stretching plotting.  For instance all the contenders are given guns but note the times when the contenders don't use guns and ask why.  At the mall, it was so a contender could prolong a killing scene.  At the hospital it was so my favourite contender could be killed off easily.Which is another point.  Due to the restrictions of the structure we don't get to know the characters too well so we don't care a great deal about them.  The worst drawn character flip-flops so much between motivations just to keep the plot going it becomes plain annoying. Making the hero pregnant is clever but it wasn't enough to make me care about her. My favourite contender wasn't the hero but someone who was the underdog and proves to be resourceful and clever under pressure.  Which made the aforementioned mistake at the hospital so unbelievable.  If contenders in fear of their lives don't always kill people by the quickest easiest method available then that's just silly. If you create a completely new world with its own rules and then you break your own rules then that's just bad film-making.

The premise of this movie is that it is actually a marathon showing of back-to-back episodes of a reality TV show called The Contenders. Except this show isn't about boxers or Muy Thai fighters. In this show, 6 people are given guns and told the winner is the last one left alive. TV camera crews follow each Contender around as they kill each other off. The reigning champion in this 7th season of the show is Dawn (Brooke Smith), a very pregnant woman who has already killed her way through two previous seasons and 10 people. Now Dawn's been brought back to her hometown to square off against 5 final opponents; Connie (Marylouise Burke) - a nurse who takes to killing like a duck to water, Tony (Michael Kaycheck) - a drug addicted Guido who decides he doesn't want to play the game, Franklin (Richard Venture) - an old crank who has coated the inside of his mobile home with lead foil, Lindsay (Angelina Philips) - a teenager with the world's stupidest parents and Jeffrey (Glenn Fitzgerald) - Dawn's old boyfriend who is dying of cancer and is married, even though he's really gay. These 6 people fight and don't fight, kill and don't kill, all while a smarmy narrator teases the audience with their eventual fates. Clearly, Series 7 is meant as a black comedy take on the reality TV genre and it does a decent job of mimicking the conventions of the genre. There are confessional moments where the characters talk directly into the camera. The show is constantly building up to big moments and then cutting away from them to stretch the suspense out as long as possible. There are even a couple of good bits where they are obviously mocking the way reality TV show producers edit these shows together to manipulate the audience into thinking and feeling certain ways about the people in the show. But the basic problem of Series 7 is that it doesn't take itself seriously enough. Being too serious is usually bad for any movie, especially a black comedy, but this story needed to be thought out a lot more. That brings in the comic book fanboy. I am one, so I can speak from experience. We take our comics very seriously. Not only can we rattle off ridiculous bits of trivia, but we actually sit around and think about stuff like&#x85;who would win in a fight between Werewolf by Night and Vixen from the Justice League. We try and figure out how Iron Man's boot jets would work in real life. We try and explain why Modok doesn't kill Captain America when he has him tied up and at the big giant head's mercy. We don't just enjoy out comics, we enjoy coming up with our own explanations for how the things in comics could and would actually happen. Series 7, however, doesn't spend any time at all thinking about that stuff. It establishes that people are chosen by lottery to participate in The Contenders, but that's where the background information ends. I t's never explained who is running the show. It's never explained how a show like this exists. It's never explained what these people are playing for, other than their lives. I t's never even really explained how the game works. Imagine watching an episode of Survivor where no one ever explained to you that the players can win immunity by doing certain things. The way the contestants behave wouldn't make much sense, would it?Series 7 doesn't bother to think about how a murderous reality show would have to be set up. It just has these people being followed around by camera crews wearing bullet proof vests, but that doesn't make any sense. There'd be camera guys getting shot left and right, both deliberately and accidentally. A reality TV show about people killing each other would have to be different in certain ways than The Amazing Race or Big Brother, but this script never bothers to wonder about any of that. That lack of intelligence or care undermines the whole film. The actors all do a decent job, but the script puts them in situations and behave in ways that don't make any sense because the script never bothers to consider how a show like this would work in real life. Series 7 was made when reality TV was still a newish genre. Perhaps back then, you could more appreciate the satire because how a reality show worked was less certain and less well understood. Today, though, we know so much about what reality TV is and how it's made that it's hard not notice that Series 7 is rather lazily put together.

I can only assume that writer/director Daniel Minahan is American and wrote this low-budget, purposely amateurish looking piece at a time and in a world where reality TV is quite probably the bane of television. Coming from the United Kingdom, we get a show entitled Big Brother once a year in the summer which usually turns into one long, hot summer slog as every night we tune in to see what pointlessness unknown's to us have got up to.For Britain, that's about as far as it goes but America perhaps take it several steps too far; they glamorise their reality stars and take it to a level that is beyond sensibility. Programs such as 'The Hills' and many real-life, MTV, 'spring break' (whatever the hell that is) set programs covering the actions and re-actions of American teens; all of whom do not, it would seem, have a care in the world. This sort of material threatens to leak over to our screens but mercifully; it is limited to only the digital networks and not the mainstream, free-to-air channels. And so comes Series 7, a film posing as a TV programme that we are directly watching but comes off as a failed piece of entertainment more so than it does an attack on reality TV.Series 7 may fall short but it is only a marginal fail, in my opinion. By the time the film enters its final stretch, I feel we are supposed to feel genuine compassion for the characters as they come to terms with their feelings but if we are not supposed to and are to remain focused on the satire then the film has failed on an even larger scale because we are wasting our time watching it. This is due to the satire that has been introduced, arrived and then left in exchange for what I presume to be mere guilty entertainment. The biggest problems with Series 7 The Contenders is its logic but this may be deliberate since a lot of reality TV shows (and their competitors) have logistical problems. These can range from the straight forward continuity errors such as the blowing out of a tire of one competitor's vehicle before having it intact the next scene to the passage of thinking of certain characters.The film comes off almost like a Dogme '95 film what with its use of natural lighting, real life settings, utilisation of props found on the location and hand held camera. The film does contain voice-overs and inserts found footage but even Scandinavian Dogme films break the rules now and again - and they invented the movement. The primary error with the film is that despite trying to look like a reality TV show, you never get the convincing feeling you're watching one. This is due to a lack of consistency on the character's respective behalf's. The idea is that several random people get drawn to take part in a free for all death match across a randomly selected city using guns or whatever they like to kill the other competitors last one standing wins. Brilliant idea, you think but when characters such as Tony (Kaycheck) are stupid enough to remain in their homes despite knowing they're in the game, only leaving when they come under fire from other competitors, you know you're watching something that has something to say on a certain subject (reality TV) but is not putting in enough effort to make it a subjective experience.There is a distinct lack of empathy (perhaps deliberately so) towards Dawn (Smith) when she tells us her father is 'buried around here, somewhere' before insulting him. Later on, we must like her enough to support her when the film enters its final acts. Then there is the flaw in the overall idea of the film if last competitions victor is brought back each time then that person will be continuously living a life of killing, etc. until they are killed themselves &#150; that cannot be right, can it? Then there is the issue surrounding the theological reason for the programme. The government within the film's universe comes up with this idea that there must be a contest in which the last competitor left standing wins and they use guns to kill each other. Surely in a country like America, what with its gun culture; its frequent shootings and gun crime, such an idea would be in poor taste. So we are to believe the government is promoting the use of firearms as a means of entertainment instead as a means of protection &#150; which is also in bad taste.I know it sounds like a contradiction but the most disturbing things amongst all this low budget but high realism violence are actually the scenes with Jeff (Fitzgerald) and his wife and how certain elements within his life affect the overall situation of the game. But it is a small element of drama that quickly turns into routine romance that we've seen in films such as Natural Born Killers, True Romance and Badlands. Indeed, more bizarre still; try watching this film which is 'government run' on a commercial television channel a government produced TV show that is interrupted by adverts? Now you're really starting to take the cake. "}{"Title":"Good until a certain character died.

I'm a fan of Merritt Wever, and when her character was brutally beaten to death (by a frickin' cane, how dumb is that?), I just didn't care to watch the movie anymore. It's just not believable after that. Are we supposed to think that she got beaten to death by a 72 year-old man with a metal cane? He was barely hitting her with it!Character development was good, for the most part. The movie focused mainly on Dawn and Jeffrey, and very little on Franklin. Everyone else is in between. Development of Connie's character was really good, as I really wanted her to die. Her first kill was tactless and she was a b*tch.But that's just me. I'm biased. All around good movie.

Can there be reality in film?  Film records moments that are real, but what happens when you stop the camera? Doesn't playing them back without context change the moment? What happens when you film small moments and edit them together?  Does any reality exist after that?    The answer is no. I think?We've been inundated with reality programming for a few years now.  The novelty has worn off.  You can see producers scraping the barrel for some new ideas.  So, I can imagine a show like SERIES 7 THE CONTENDERS, being pitched by a bunch of young up and coming producers and that's what scares me.Picture this every human being is given a number.  There is a lottery and those who win have to be on the hottest reality television show THE CONTENDERS.  The premises of said show kill the other contenders.  If you're the only survivor you must come back for the next season.  As our film opens seven seasons have passed, and five new contenders are chosen.The contender who survived season six is Dawn Lagarto (Brooke Smith, Vanya of 42 Street- Who coincidentally shares a close resemblance to SURVIVOR 1's SUSAN HAWK) a women who is eight months pregnant and while has a rough exterior has a heart of gold.  The other contenders are Connie (Marylouise Burke, Meet Joe Black) the catholic nurse with sociopathic tendencies. Jeffery (Glenn Fitzgerald, Buffalo Soldiers), the testicular cancer victims who just may be gay, or maybe he's in love with Dawn. Tony, (Michael Kaycheck, Requiem for a Dream) an unemployed oaf who has a family on the edge of deterioration.  Franklin (Richard Venture, Courage under Fire), a strange old man whom has conspiracy theories on the brain.   Then there is Lindsey (Merritt Wever, Signs) the high school flirt with doting parents (her mother is played beautifully by Ex-Mrs. Rudy Gulianni, Donna Hanover).Director Daniel Minahan (TV's Six Feet Under) crafts a fascinating tale with a great gimmick.  The entire movie is told as the entire seventh season of THE CONTENDERS.  What I like about this gimmick is it allows Minahan to be a character himself.  He is the puppet moving these characters around.  Also helping with the story is typical TV style narration nicely delivered by Will Arnett (Southie).  These elements help create a briskly told, interesting character study of why we as people enjoy watching reality shows.Brooke Smith is really good as Dawn.  What I especially liked about her was that she had this rough exterior but in the small moments she shows genuine concern about what was going on.  This film is really her story, and she plays it straight.  Every time the camera is on her she's in true form. True to herself and true to those around her.  In fact many of the scenes without her fall flat or are over the top silly.The same can be said of Glenn Fitzgerald role as Jeffery. He and Smith transcend the material making it their own. Minahan was smart to follow them.  Jeffrey's story is really sad and there is this certain amount of pain and anguish in him and Fitzgerald gives him the right amount of sympathy and humor.  I love Jeffery's still life photography.  It's brilliant!.That's why I wished the other actors had paid more attention to there roles. None of them is very confident with their characters.  There is a tongue and cheek quality to them, so a lot of the satire falls flat.  Some of that is the screenplay's fault.  It barely develops the character of Franklin who fills the screen for no more than five or six minutes.  Lindsey is always upstaged by her parents. Which is funny to a point.  But why this film works in some places and not in others is because the moment the film becomes self aware of it's comedy, we as an audience are pulled out of it.I also think the movie goes a little bit longer than it should.  There are certain moments that just dragged on.  I will admit that I stopped the film in places and picked it up later. But with a film like this you can do that. Because when the film is on, it's dead on and when it drags you can forgive it.  It's also told episodically so it allows you that freedom.So in the end, did I like SERIES 7THE CONTENDERS?  Yes, very much.  It is a biting satire that only gets better  years.  Why? Because as television reality programming pushes the line more and more a program like THE CONTENDERS is closer to being a reality.

They can not if they have to sort out who they really are and what their limits are. They  owe it to themselves to be the best they can be.

First, it's wickedly funny.  The commentary between action sequences is modeled after the typical documentary in reality programming, and in many cases, is funny by it's own right.  The situations in the larger picture, though, are even funnier as the full scope of all the subplots emerge.Second, it's horrifyingly shocking.  I'm not one to be turned off by movie violence, but the violence that is at the heart of this movie is fully realized and portrayed very well.  It's hard to watch.The combination of the two is where Minahan and company really show their skill.  The juxtaposition of the constant humor with the shrieks and cries of a mother as she watches helplessly while her teenage daughter gets beaten to death is the vehicle that drives the whole point of the movie home to the viewer.  This movie is entertaining because of the humor, but the violence takes the content outside of the movie and into the real world.  The adept viewer walks away with a renewed shock that behind the reality TV and the constant flow of trash on Springer and other talk shows that we use as entertainment, lie real people, with real problems.  It's hard to watch those shows again and take the situations out of the context of a real life.To those who criticize the violence in the movie, I can only suggest what the movie would be like without it -- it would be the same kind of exploitative trash that is the subject of it's satire.

It is a very innovative film, and is very versatile also.  It is an action flick, a drama, a romance flick, a suspense flick, and a black comedy.  First I will talk about the action.  The action is brilliant.  Of course a flick about a reality show where contestants are killed off is going to have action, but the action is this one is brilliant and violent, with each contestant having a brilliantly thought up death, except the winner, who wins in such a way that has sequel written all over it.  Personally I hope it spawns a sequel.It is also a drama, as the contestants tell their personal stories of hardship.  They all live in a small Southwestern Connecticut town (it is fictional but I think it is Norwalk in real life).  Each contestant telles a different story, from the tough family man Tony (Michael Kaycheck) to pregnant Dawn (Brooke Smith), who won the last game and has a broken relationship with her mother, explained in the film.  Seeing the characters die and seeing an end being put to their stories definately qualifies this as a drama.Series 7 is also a romance flick.  From the goth type music video that shows the characters Jeff (Glenn Fitzgerald) and Dawn (Brooke Smith) as teens in love, to the love between Jeff, a testicular cancer patient, and Dawn for the film, in which Jeff even ditches his wife for Dawn.This flick also is a suspenseful movie, keeping the viewer on the edge of their seat trying to guess who will win and waiting to see who dies next.The film also has elements of black comedy, as it is a spoof of reality shows, and spoofs those shows in brilliant fashion.As you can see, Series 7 is a brilliant film which is versatile and a definate reccomended viewing.My Rating 9 out of 10 or A- "}{"Title":"Probably one of the worse movies of 2001","Date":"6 February 2002","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Thriller","Review":"  *Spoilers ahead, but that shouldn't matter since i hope you wont see this one anyway*If you planned to see this one i have to strongly advice you not to. Because this was one of the most wasted 1¬Ω hours I've experienced.First of all, this is an complete rip-off of the great movie Battle Royale. It is as stupid as watching any lame American TV-show like Cops or Candid Camera.The plot are totally predictable. One challenger pregnant and another is a nurse, anyone doing some logic thinking understands in the beginning what should happen between those.The concept is ripped as mentioned before and the movie lacks the violence necessary of making this movie enjoyable. I mean, the preggo shoots a guy in the back and no blood or not even any trace of the hit in the back.I could go on forever without finding anything good about it, so take your money and get a copy of Battle Royale instead of watching this piece of crap.1 out of 10, too bad i couldn't rate it lower.

It is a cunning, flawless parody of a genre of TV show which is neither.  On its own, the film is a hilarious story (the premise is BRILLIANT), but its true genius is in the way it mocks reality TV, which it does PERFECTLY.  Everything is so ridiculous, so obviously contrived and commercial, so baldly formulaic, it can only be the work of one who knows reality TV well enough to point out its most absurd qualities.  Daniel Minahan is not only such a person, but an exceedingly clever, skillful writer.  He has managed to kill two birds at once by writing what is not only a carbon copy of an actual reality show, but also a humorous, sardonic story which can stand on its own.  Like all skilled parody artists, half the brilliance of Minahan's work lies is the ironic way in which he imitates the genre he's mocking, weaving subtle mockery into his reality-show clone with the deft hands of a puppet-master.With perhaps a couple exceptions, the acting is brilliant, especially on the part of Dawn and Jeff, who were so totally real, I almost thought I remembered them from Temptation Island or Survivor or The Real World. Then, of course, I remembered that I dont' watch that crap, but that's neither here nor there.  Tony, Connie, and Jeff's wife were wonderful caricatures, and the fact that they were predictable and yet not made them PERFECT characters in the context of the film.  Congratulations to a cast of unknown actors and actresses - show 'em how it's done, people.  Ya don't need your name on magazine covers to be a damn fine performer, and casts like this are living proof.  Hell, even the old guy was good, and he was in it for what, 15 minutes?Anyway, Series 7 is an awesome film and everyone should see it.  Anybody who's ever seen even an episode of one of our many reality TV shows will most likely laugh their head off at the devious way in which Minahan picks the genre apart and reveals it for what it is  voyeurism, pure and simple. The pretext (and yes, it IS nothing more than a pretext) of being able to see into real people's lives draws people to watch these shows the same way the open window of the girl next door draws young men to steal their father's binoculars in hope of catching her in a state of undress.  With reality TV, it's not physical vulnerability that draws us, but emotional - the chance to look at people's secret wants and desires.  Minahan obviously understands this, and his film exploits this principle flawlessly.Everyone involved with this film should get a medal, and Daniel Minahan should be built a shrine.  This movie is a work of genius.  Watch it right now, and if you don't love it, there's something wrong with you.

I hate all of those reality based television shows like Survivor and Temptation Island (to name a few) and I thought this would be an ok parody of those shows.What an understatement. I have not laughed this much in a theatre for a long time.This movie takes every aspect and gimmick that makes reality television retarded and exaggerates it.The basic premise of the movie is there are 6 contestants picked out by numbers that the government assigns to people. Those 6 contestants have to play the game and are all given a Glock 17 handgun. The only prize in the game is...... your life!I would definitely recommend this movie to people who like dark comedies and have a twisted sense of humor. Some of the scenes are quite f*****d up and not for everyone.Enjoy!

Aside from its bargain basement production values, which present an eyesore 10 minutes in, the overall tone of the film is misguided. Several reviewers have attacked the acting in the film, but I think the real problem is this lame attempt to make the film into a farce. Aside from the fact that the jokes are not funny (a pregnant woman swears a lot, a young girl gets a bunch of guns), it doesn't gel with the overall tone of the film. Had the makers actually made Series 7 to bear a striking resemblance to actual reality TV-colorful yet hollow edits, lame sound effects, sweeping camera motions-maybe their point would have been more solid or at least more palatable. Instead Series 7 meanders through the already harried world of death and game show. You can just imagine the director slapping himself on the back for stating the obvious "},{"Title":"Wow!

Like Swift, Voltaire and more recently Brass Eye's Chris Morris, Minahin's film gets right under the skin of his society's skewed sense of morality.I stumbled into Series 7 The Contenders. Having heard very little about it, I went to see it simply as an alternative Captain Correlli's Mandolin and the loathsome Nicolas Cage. My friend Kevin and I were among an audience of only 9 - and this in its first week of release. I remember a feeling of dread, having been in a similar situation the week before and sitting through the terminally-bad The Hole. Within seconds though I was sold. The film is laugh out loud funny from the word go, and manages to keep on surprising and taking more and more ridiculous twists as it rides towards its hilarious climax. Halfway through the film I turned around to see if the rest of the audience were as thrilled to have stumbled upon such a gem and discovered that Kevin and myself were the only people who had sat it through.Series 7 is certainly dark and maybe it has a very particular taste of comedy, but I really find it difficult to believe that anyone would not find it wonderfully funny and masterfully acted by a great ensemble of unknowns. I can only hope that it might get a new lease of life on video, as it left the theatres too quickly to make an impact. It delves into the heart and soul of the Made-For-TV lifestyle America has franchised around the world and takes no prisoners. Ridiculous? Yes, and yet utterly believable. Truly a masterpiece of satire waiting to be discovered. And who says Americans don't do irony?

Since then it has bubbled up to the top of my consciousness maybe once a week or so. As a point of comparison I don't remember too much about the original Running Man but I do recall it was a ham-handed what if scenario of a brutal futuristic game show that asked me to believe in the fairy tales that good is 100% good and always wins, bad is 100% bad and can't survive the light of day - if only it were so. In these times of corporate dominated media and government domestic spying such notions seem naive in the extreme.So, to me anyway, this film was more about how incredibly effective the corporate media is at manipulating one's persona, and how anyone can fall victim - on both sides of the screen. None of the contestants seemed to have any choices. They couldn't not participate in the killing, but almost more important they had no control over how they were portrayed on the screen, their humanity subsumed absolutely by the stereotypes thrust upon them in the editing room. And we, being the flawed creatures we are, fall for it time and again, even if we suspect we are being manipulated, which I find profoundly depressing.I've seen tons of all sorts of movies, and this is one of the few that I desperately wish I'd had the idea for. The intentional cheesiness of the acting and intentionally lame TV video quality only enhance the reality of the experience. What a totally genius, high impact, low budget, incredibly effective project. Bravo!!!
