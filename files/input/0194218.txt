[{"Title":"a genuinely chilling thriller","Date":"25 January 2002","Score":"34 out of 37 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":"  The `banality of evil' has long been a source of fascination for those artists exploring the dark side of human nature.  Gloomy houses filled with vengeful spirits or twitching psychos hold less fear for the common man than the sudden discovery that the `people next door,' the PTA member down the street, or the social director for the local church youth group are the true villains who surround us unnoticed, people whose very `normalcy' serves to mask the evil within.  For only when the mask is finally ripped off and we at last get to see what we have been living next to all along do we come to realize how very tenuous is our security and safety in this world.  What could be scarier than that?In this category of works, `Panic' emerges as a genuinely chilling, emotionally unsettling psychological thriller, short on gratuitous violence and long on characterization and mood.  Writer/director Henry Bromell has fashioned a dark, disturbing tale of a man named Alex (William H. Macy) who seeks the professional help of a therapist played by John Ritter.  Alex's problem is a decidedly unique one  it seems that, since he's been a teen, he has served as hit man for his father (Donald Sutherland) whose mysterious, shady `business' apparently calls for the elimination of certain parties at the request of unknown `clients.'  Alex is a seemingly good man, devoted to his wife and son, who has somehow found a way to distance himself emotionally and morally from the heinous crimes he commits.  Yet, obviously, Alex has arrived at a point of moral reckoning &#150; for how else to explain his sudden need to unburden himself to this total stranger?  Macy gives a brilliant performance as Alex, showing, in his totally understated reactions to the people and events around him, what it is like to be buttoned up so tight that even with all the mayhem and filial abuse he's experienced in his life he is able to truthfully say `I don't know if I've ever been angry' &#150; even at his father who got him into this life in the first place.  What makes `Panic' so unsettling is that it violates all our comforting notions about the ties that bind father to son and family members to each other.  Rather than setting a fine moral example for their child, both of Alex's parents, Michael (Donald Sutherland) and Deidre (Barbara Bain), have actually groomed him to become a cold-blooded killer.  Yet, life seems to go on in surface ease within the confines of not only that family but Alex's own family as well.  Alex keeps the truth hidden from both his wife, Martha (Tracy Ullman) and his 6-year old son, Sammy (David Dorfman), allowing them to function almost as any other normal suburban family.Yet, Alex has other, perhaps more mundane problems as well.  He meets a somewhat disturbed 23-year old fellow patient named Sarah (Neve Campbell) to whom he feels an immediate attraction.  Tentatively, these two lost souls grope towards each other, both of them hoping to find in the other that which is lacking in themselves.  But in many ways, Alex is actually a man of strong moral character in certain aspects of his life and he agonizes over taking the initial step towards consummating their relationship, knowing it will harm the wife he loves but no longer feels attracted to.  Bromell's sophisticated screenplay refuses to spell out every psychological detail for the audience, allowing us to make our own connections, draw our own conclusions and reach our own moral judgments.  As director as well, Bromell establishes and maintains a mood of almost heartbreaking melancholy and sadness.  Characters rarely speak above a hush; the camera glides slowly along taking in the scene at a leisurely, unhurried pace; and the haunting musical score heightens the strange unreality of the world which these people have come to inhabit, a world that seems to call into question everything we take for granted in the area of morality, ethics and basic common decency.  The performances from every member of the cast (right on down to little David Dorfman) are letter perfect.  Each of these fine actors knows exactly the right note to hit in every scene, never cutting against the grain of understated seriousness that Bromell has established.`Panic' is a small, underrated gem that lingers long in one's memory.

Though Panic may seem to derive from unoriginal material, Brommel's lifelike characters coupled with deft dialogue and observant direction make the film a realistic look at the undoing of a middle aged man.William H. Macy stars as Alex, a hitman who works for his father's (Sutherland)  contract-killing business. He leads a double life, with his wife  (Ullman) and son unaware of his real trade.  In his middle-age, he becomes increasingly disgusted with what he has done all his life. Under his calm, collected facade stirs repressed resentment for his father's controlling grasp on his life. When he meets a young woman(Campbell) he feels invigored and decides it's time to quit the family business.The fact that writer/director Henry Brommel decided to make the profession his main character was trying to break away from contract-killing is disposable.  He could have easily substituted it with any undesirable profession; his characters are so well-developed and believable, scenes handled so smoothly and realisticly and dialogue written so insightfully and naturally that the focus falls on Macy's conflicted character rather than his job as a hitman.  Brommel's script feels like a Shakespearean tragedy, with a definite theme of destiny running throughout.In Alex, Macy creates a tragic, easily sympathetic character, and turns in yet another brooding, great performance, as can always be expected.  Donald Sutherland is also effectively abrasive and abusive as his overbearing father, and Ullman's dramatic turn as Macy's wife is a welcome change for the comedian.  Consider a scene in a bicycle shop, where her mood subtly darkens and peaks in an affecting scene of emotional confusion.Henry Brommel's first feature, Panic is a film that is well-crafted in its sincerity.  With a first-rate cast, a plausible script, terse dialogue, and nice direction, this character-study is hopefully just a taste of Brommel's aptness for creating characters that seem real.   8 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Dad","Date":"5 August 2004","Score":"20 out of 21 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":"  I recently caught up with this little gem of a film on cable.

One always wonders about the secret life of hit killers. One doesn't have to go too far to realize they probably are one's own neighbors, or social acquaintances, or even friends; they're no different from us, at least on the surface.In this story, the grandfather, is a despicable character who does not hesitate in eliminating anyone for the right price. He has no scruples in teaching the ropes to his own son, and even to the grandson!Alex, is a man living in turmoil. He knows what he has done in the past and suddenly is coming to realize the consequence of his actions. He has to see someone to help him find peace with himself. In going to Dr. Parks, he is trying to find absolution, although, he doesn't find it there. On the contrary, there is a dramatic twist when Alex learns about who is supposed to kill next.Alex, brilliantly portrayed by William H. Macy, mesmerizes us. Not only is he a fantastic actor, but he makes us believe he is that man. One of the best things in the movie is the late John Ritter. He is equally convincing as Dr. Parks, the man who unravels the mystery.Donald Sutherland, as the grandfather is perfect. He is a natural actor in everything he does. Neve Campbell surprised in her pivotal role of Sarah. She shows a capability and range that are incredible. Tracey Ullman is Martha, the suffering wife, and she doesn't get to do much.

Macy, Neve Campbell, Tracey Ullman, Donald Sutherland, John Ritter, Barbara Bain, David Dorfman.  (Dir Henry Bromell)Character actor William H. Macy has that certain beleagured, world-weary, kicked-dog look about him that fits like a cheap suit but all the same a perfect match for his deceptive moping demeanor.  In this black comedy he plays Alex, a depressed contract killer who decides to see a therapist to come to terms with `the family business' with his overbearing father (the always underrated and subtly silky Sutherland) who taught Macy  in his preadolescence the fine art of killing for a career. Unbeknownst to his adoring wife Martha (a surprisingly low-key dramatic turn by comedy superstar Ullman) and his precociously wise-beyond-his-years 6 year old Sammy (newcomer Dorfman; cute kid), Alex is seeing Dr. Parks (Ritter) on the sly and his only confidante is his mother (Bain, who seems to have been off the screen radar for some time) who seems like one shrewd cookie (after all that's how her husband got his job!) Unsure of the risk in seeing the shrink, Alex continues when he meets in the waiting room Sarah (the wonderful Campbell, in a nicely played role), a beautiful young woman, who is seeing another psychologist in the adjoining office building.  He is immediately smitten by her but remains guarded the entire time, plotting for the right moment which never seems to come.What makes matters worse is his latest offing to kill Parks.  This conflict of interest gnaws at him and only adds fuel to the fire for his desire for Sarah, who also harbors a yen for the gloomy fellow traveler. All this adds up for some sly dialogue, innuendo and ultimately a final confrontation with Alex facing his fears - his father, his `job' and Sarah over his family. Macy is in fine form with his mild-mannered family man clearly at odds with his other life and the desire he has for Campbell who also acquits herself nicely as the bluntly spoken bisexual freespirit. The film pales in comparison to the latest splinter faction of hitmen in  analysis fodder (`Grosse Pointe Blank', `Analyze This' and `The Sopranos') yet it balances the fine line of comedy and tragedy particularly thanks to the cool undulating tones of Sutherland (witness his threat to his son in a bowling alley bar that goes from ice cold to sunny as he impromptu dances with a waitress). If you like your noir with a touch of comedy this is the film for you.

Well, kind of.)To tell you the truth, well, I expected quite a lot out of this film. Roger Ebert praised it quite a lot, giving it four stars and speaking of how it's a tragedy that it wasn't released properly. Also some TV Guide publications gave the film four stars around here -- FOUR STARS. It may not sound like much, but four stars hasn't really been thrown around for ANY 90's film -- Pulp Fiction, American Beauty, Heavenly Creatures, and others, got the 3 1/2 star rating. And this film, starring one of my favorite actors (William H. Macy), got four freaking stars -- of course I'd love to catch it.I began to get more and more disappointed as the film went on. A lot of it just felt forced, manipulative, and contrived. Cliched I could even say.There were a few instances where the film worked -- the father and son discussions felt very real, relaxed, and right. And I especially liked the scenes between Macy and Neve Campbell.But then you have the whole squirrel issue -- not so much with William H. Macy's case, but when we see his son participate in squirrel hunting as well. There's a case where the film goes into phony melodrama.Actually, nearly every scene with the young kid (except the father/son discussions) really doesn't work for me.The ending involves the son in the fullest extent. And for me it once again falls apart, because I don't know why anyone would want to give such important scenes to this kid. Like the ending, for example -- you have the loud, dramatic music against his rather phony acting.Not every single thing fails in this film. John Ritter completely works in his role. And there are other things... but I seriously don't see what all the big deal was. It's not a great film... more mediocre than anything else.Perhaps I have to see it again to really get it or something.

Other than well-done cinematography, I couldn't find much of anything to like about this film. The plot and characters are cliched and one-dimensional; I would rather watch more acknowledged cliches done well than more ridiculously precocious children, criminals with family lives, and bad guys who see therapists. The characters' extreme simplicity would be forgivable in a movie with something else taking up screen time, but in a movie that seemingly is about nothing but characters, it's dumbfounding. Only Macy has any hint of complexity, and it's really little more than a veneer established by making him awkward and moody.  The major plot points are fairly easy to predict; it's only a matter of when. The performances are mostly decent, (with the exception of the typically lousy Campbell) but the actors aren't given that much to work with; there are no memorable lines or particularly impressive acting moments.

William H. Macy plays Alex, a hit man who is carrying on the family business under pressure from his father. The first obstacle for me was accepting the mild-mannered Macy as a hit man. I can accept the fact that there are hit men living in apparently normal circumstances and keeping their business a secret, I just did not accept Macy in the role. As the father I suppose Donald Sutherland portrays a person who is amoral enough to be a hit man, but there again there was some hardness lacking. Think of the hit men in The Godfather and compare.The next obstacle was believing in the relationship that developed between the young, beautiful and lively Sarah (Neve Campbell) and the confused, middle-aged and withdrawn Alex? What was there about Alex that would attract Sarah, who was shown as predominately lesbian? I didn't see it.The scenes with Alex and his six year old son Sammy were touching and were the only scenes where Alex seemed relaxed and engaged. But the kid spoke in a manner way beyond his years and clearly was just reciting written dialog.Alex has kept his death-dealing profession a secret from his wife. Supposedly he made a living by running a mail-order business selling lawn ornaments, kitchen gadgets, sexual aids and such. Does his wife really think that he is supporting the family with that kind of business? She would certainly have to be involved in such a business to make a go of it, and consequently she would know about the finances and see that things did not add up.The dialog tended toward the affected. For example the first lines in the movie have Alex saying to himself, Do you ever get the feeling that you're dead? Like some dog lying on the street that's been hit by a car and left there to rot. Does anyone actually talk to himself like that?The music tries to add an element of suspense and threat but I felt it was too intrusive.Having said all of that, the beautiful photography saved this movie for me. The settings are artistically composed and the lighting impressive. And the actors are all in good form. It's too bad that all of this talent was not put to better use.

Macy, Tracy Ullman, John Ritter, Neve Campbell, Donald Sutherland, Barbara Bain, David Dorfman. Brommel has cast Ullman and Ritter in decidedly un-funny roles, and the offbeat casting is a welcome change from what we normally see.Panic is the story of a hit man, Alex (Macy) who actually works for his father (Sutherland). He covers his true profession by doing mail order work; by all appearances, he and his wife (Ullman) and their son Sammy (Dorfman) are a typical suburban family. Unhappy with his life, Alex seeks the help of a psychiatrist (Ritter), telling only his mother (Bain). In the waiting room, he meets a young woman (Campbell) to whom he is immediately attracted, which complicates his situation further. His mother breaks her promise and tells his father about the psychiatrist. When Alex receives his next assignment, he discovers that he is to kill his psychiatrist.This is a profound story of a gentle, good man made into a killer by a monster of a father, with his mother's knowledge, who kills to please his father but also can't stand up to him and quit. His rage is so deep-seated that he has lost emotional attachment to just about everything and everyone except his son - and it's finally his son who wakes him up out of a nearly lifelong repression. When it's time for Panic to moves, it does - quickly.Panic doesn't seem panicked at all. In fact, it moves very slowly. But it moves slowly not because it's poorly made - the slowness is deliberate, mirroring Alex's own psyche slowly coming out of the fog. By making a decision about Sara, the Campbell character, and by seeing his mark, his own psychiatrist, as a living, breathing human being, Alex starts to make the connections between what he does and who he is -and how they don't jive. And the difference between the two could lead to the loss of another psyche, Sammy's.William Macy gives another brilliant performance, as a loving father, a distant husband, and a cold killer, the child of two monsters who never cared a damn for his feelings or desires, a man who realizes finally that he has to step up to the plate or have the cycle repeated.This is not the kind of drama that plays well in a movie theater. It's too adult, too small, too subtle, too character-driven, and too good.

It's not a topic that lends itself well to screenplays, since the attacks are, by nature, inexpressible.  One doesn't know what's happening, except that one feels the need to medicate with drugs, alcohol, or sex.  Something's wrong, but what? But that's exactly what makes Panic so engaging.  Most of the film's psychological drama lies, like an iceberg, beneath the surface.  One watches the main character behave as if in a somnambulistic trance, going through the motions of life, not knowing exactly what he is doing, or why.  We see him commit a murder, in cold blood, and then go home to his lovely wife and son as if he'd just made a trip to the grocery store.  Yet the confusion and the angst are visible for the knowing eye to see.  And when he's with his father, who has crafted every inch of his son's personality as his own mirror image, there's a sense of normalcy to bed down the feelings of panic and anxiety.  One practically feels reassured as to the nobility of the assassin's profession.  Panic is a movie that expresses these difficult, conflicting emotions through actions, body language, and gestures, but not with words.  The scenes in the psychiatrist's office are a far cry from the blubbering, effusive outbursts in movies like Prince of Tides, and thankfully so.  There's one other thing that I really liked about Panic, which, I admit, comes directly from my own personal experience  the panic stricken man comes to understand his father as a monster, not a stern but loving patriarch, by comparing his relationship with his son to his father's relationship with himself.

Although there are many cases supporting and disapproving both theories, it is hard to argue against the fact that children raised in a hostile environment are usually aggressive themselves. In Henry Bromell's Panic (2000) Alex (William H. Macy) was trained to be an assassin at a very young age by his father (Donald Sutherland). After a childhood of practicing on squirrels, rabbits, and other animals, Alex becomes the primary hit-man in his father's family business of contract killing. Years go by and Alex never complains about having to assassinate numerous people (some innocent). However, eventually Alex realizes that he is suffering from severe depression and he can't figure out why. He has a loving family, yet he aspires for a dramatic change in not only his occupation but his entire lifestyle. In an attempt to transform his life, Alex begins forming a romantic friendship with a young girl (Neve Campbell) he meets at his psychologist's office. Also, for the first time he begins to stand up to his parents, who have always demanded perfection from him especially when working on the job. The relationships that Alex has with the people closest to him including his psychiatrist and his new love interest are what make Panic a superior thriller.Personally my favorite scenes are the flashback sequences in which Alex's father (Donald Sutherland) teaches his son the art of murder. All of these scenes have a very creepy undertone caused by the way Sutherland reacts lightly to the murdering of innocent animals and people. Very few actors are able to pull this off to the same extent as Sutherland does, which can also be seen in one of my favorite films from the 1980s called Eye of the Needle (1981). Overall, Panic may be hard to find at Blockbuster or Movie Gallery since it was such a low-budget film, but if you are a member of Instant Netflix it is definitely worth your time. Although there are not many action sequences, it is more thrilling than most films.

Macy, but you may also feel a bit of uncomfortable empathy, too.  I was prepared to be offended by this movie about a man who kills people for money, especially since when this man, the central character, is supposedly made sympathetic because he seeks out the help of a psychologist.  Perhaps this would be a dark comedy?   I'm not sure what type to consider it as a whole, but all in all, I found it very moving.  Alex, the hitman, is trained from early childhood to exercise cold control and use a gun to take a life, first a squirrel, years later as a young adult, a stranger in a car.  His father, Michael, establishes the business of being a hired killer, by wedding a woman who could help him get started in the business.  Alex's life is contradictory from early on  he exhibits the professional detachment needed to carry out hits, yet he lacks the confidence, even as a middle-aged man, to defy his father and quit the business.  Yet it is obvious that Alex wants out.  He finds himself to be considered old by a young woman he finds beautiful, yet he is helpless to turn his life in a more moral direction. He is a fairly good and certainly gentle husband and a wonderful father, despite having been raised by his seemingly sociopathic parents who are also absurd control freaks.  It is not beneath his dignity to dress up as a monster to delight the children at his son's birthday party.  But he is deeply, deeply sad.  As the movie progresses, it seems that Alex truly believes that a way out for him is pure fantasy.  One can, in their mid to late forties, turn one's life around if the faults are less severe than Alex's.  But one cannot give life back to those who were murdered.  Still, he yearns for a miracle, and to me this plays out in his half-hearted pursuit of a much-younger beautiful woman, Sarah.  He knows that a real, lasting relationship with this fantasy woman would be very unlikely unless he could transform himself into a young man of her age....perhaps when he killed his first victim.  It seems that Alex believes only time-travel could save him....back to a time before he crossed the line that he could never uncross.SOME SPOILER Alex, to me, is resolved to the idea that he doomed, yet he does eventually show the moral courage to stop his father from committing any more murders or recruiting anymore children into the business, and also to stop himself. It is, ironically, his father's contemptuous remark to Alex of Who says? (Alex had just told his father that he should not have taken Alex's son and Michael's grandson, Sammy out to the woods to experiment with shooting a squirrel).  Finally, Alex has an identity, and it is a braver one than he had known.To sum up, VERY good movie!!

They play off each other like members of a top-notch theatrical troupe, who realize that a quality product requires each actor to support the others unselfishly.

There are places to laugh, to be shocked, to be horrified, to be saddened, to be aroused, to be angry, and to love.

A good writer gives the reader room to breath and supplies the oxygen. Its got to flow as if you knew it all along, so you can cocreate the images with the writer -- so that you suggest things to him that he picks up on. Some deadtree writers understand this -- very few screenwriters do. And of those that do, it appears that they need to take matters into their own hands.This makes two great screenwriter/directors to appear this year, Garcia and Bromell. In one case the pathos of loneliness, in the other the pathos of not being alone. One feminine, one masculine. Both mastering the quiet sin of covering ourselves with someone's troubled soul, knowing their pain but only (only!) feeling an echo of our own.Some small self-reference with the framing as a bed-time story and an internal framing as the all-important squirrel kill. But otherwise it is an emotional meditation, straightahead honesty. The cast knows this and even Ullman plays it straight. Must have taken some real convincing in her case, and I'm sure she was cast because she has a reputation for playing multiple characters.Macy already has enough classy work to see he knows and apparently can advertise his strengths. Check out Jurassic Park III where he talks always ahead of the beat. Not as fast as Jennifer Jason Leigh in Hudsucker, but the same notion of making fun of acting. Then turn to State and Main where he actually directs bad actors but varying his delivery! Then to Mystery Men where he plays three roles himself looking at you and winking; the family man who needs a role; and that role (the shoveller), each with a different speech pattern. So he knows how to stand in two sets of shoes, the writer's and the actor's.Here he stands in two without acknowledgement your shoes as cowriter, and Alex's. No one else has to work very hard. Sutherland overdoes it, but that's the point of the character. Campbell has no center, and that's right too. Doesn't matter whether she's good enough to do so if needed. Its the breakdancing of acting.

Well, I paid to see it in a theatre, and I'm glad I did because visually it was a striking film. Most of the settings seem like they were made in the early 60s (except for the shrink's office, which was dated in a different way), and if you leave the Neve Campbell sequences out, the whole film has a washed- out early 60s ambience. And the use of restaurants in the film was fascinating. For a first-time director whose background, I believe, is in writing, he has a great eye. Within the first ten minutes I felt the plot lacked plausibility, so I just willingly suspended my disbelief and went along for the ride. In terms of acting and the depiction of father-son, mother-son, husband-wife, parent-child relationships, the film was spot-on. William H. Macy, a pleasure to watch, seems to be filling the void left by the late Tony Perkins, if this and Magnolia are any indication. Tracey Ullman as the neglected wife was quite moving, to me. It was a three-dimensional depiction of a character too often viewed by society as two-dimensional. Of course, Donald Sutherland can add this to his collection of unforgettable portrayals. The depiction of the parents (Bain/Sutherland) reminded me, in an indirect way, of Vincent Gallo's BUFFALO '66, although toned-down quite a bit! I would definitely pay money to see a second film from this director. He has the self-discipline of a 50s b-crimefilm director (something P.T.Anderson will never have!), yet he has a visual style and a way with actors that commands attention. "},{"Title":"Wonderful! Wonderful! Wonderful!","Date":"28 August 2000","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":"  It is always sad when fringe movies such as this are overlooked by the majority of filmgoers. Panic is a wonderfully compelling and poignant study of a character who feels trapped in the pointlessness of his own life.William H. Macy, as Alex, is as convincing as always. This fine actor seems to have a special talent for pulling at your heartstrings, no matter how flawed his characters may be; we may not always condone the lifestyles of the protagonists he plays, but the emotions of fear and confusion that he evokes in us are often all too painfully familiar. The title, Panic, initially seems paradoxical, given the lack of overt emotion. At one point Alex tells his doctor that he rarely gets angry. Yet, as this story unfolds, it becomes increasingly obvious that rage and desperation, not indifference, are the driving forces behind this man's existence.More than once I was reminded of his performance in Fargo, another strongly character-driven movie. In both Fargo and Panic we witness a middle aged man who somehow seems to have stepped out of synch with the rest of life. He has lost his way, and the only way back deceptively appears to be though the darkness. He knows he is making bad choices, but desperation overpowers self-control and common sense.Alex connects with Sarah, a 23 year old woman (mesmorizingly played by Neve Campbell), whom he meets in a doctor's office. Thematically, this union is less coincidence, more the work of fate. Alex finds a certain comfort being with Sarah, sensing perhaps that she is a fellow drifter, like him, someone who has lost her way and is floating aimlessly through the rest of her life, waiting powerlessly for its inevitable conclusion.Opting for movies such as this is a shrewd and convincing way for Neve Campbell to answer those critics who question her acting abilities. Too often it is the characters she has played who are the weakness, offering Campbell no depth in which to flex her acting muscles. This performance, however, may be an eye-opener for many.In a perfect movie world, not only would there be many more films like Panic, but also they would reach and be appreciated by a much wider audience. If you watch movies for the richness and depth of characterization, rather than merely the latest state-of-the-art special effects, then, for you, Panic is unmissable. A+.

Macy and Donald Sutherland.  It's a telling look at how indecision and denial can bring about the internal strife and misery that ultimately leads to apathy and that moment of truth when the conflict must, of necessity, at last be resolved.	Alex (Macy) is tired; he has a loving wife, Martha (Tracey Ullman), a precocious six-year-old son, Sammy (David Dorfman), a mail order business he runs out of the house, as well as his main source of income, the `family' business he shares with his father, Michael (Sutherland), and his mother, Deidre (Barbara Bain).  But he's empty; years of plying this particular trade have left him numb and detached, putting him in a mental state that has driven him to see a psychologist, Dr. Josh Parks (John Ritter).  And to make matters worse (or maybe better, depending upon perspective), in Dr. Parks' waiting room he meets a young woman, Sarah Cassidy (Neve Campbell), whose presence alone makes him feel alive for the first time since he can remember.  She quickly becomes another brick in the wall of the moral conflict his job has visited upon him, as in the days after their meeting he simply cannot stop thinking about her.  His whole life, it seems, has become a `situation'-- one from which he is seemingly unable to successfully extirpate himself without hurting the ones he loves.  He can deny his age and the fact that he has, indeed, slipped into a genuine midlife crisis, but he is about to discover that the problems he is facing are simply not going to go away on their own.  He's at a crossroads, and he's going to have to decide which way to go.  And he's going to have to do it very soon.	From a concept that is intrinsically interesting, Bromell has fashioned an engrossing character study that is insightful and incisive, and he presents it is a way that allows for moments of reflection that enable the audience to empathize and understand what Alex is going through.  He makes it very clear that there are no simple answers, that in real life there is no easy way out.  His characters are well defined and very real people who represent the diversity found in life and, moreover, within any given family unit.  The film resoundingly implies that the sins of the father are irrefutably passed on to the progeny, with irrevocable consequences and effects.  When you're growing up, you accept your personal environment as being that of the world at large; and often it is years into adulthood that one may begin to realize and understand that there are actually moral parameters established by every individual who walks upon the planet, and that the ones set by the father may not be conducive to the tenets of the son.  And it is at that point that Alex finds himself as the story unfolds; ergo, the midlife crisis, or more specifically, the crisis of conscience from which he cannot escape.  It's a powerful message, succinctly and subtly conveyed by Bromell, with the help of some outstanding performances from his actors.	For some time, William H. Macy has been one of the premiere character actors in the business, creating such diverse characters as Quiz Kid Donnie Smith in `Magnolia,' The Shoveler in `Mystery Men' and Jerry Lundegaard in `Fargo.'  And that's just a sampling of his many achievements.  At one point in this film, Sarah mentions Alex's `sad eyes,' and it's a very telling comment, as therein lies the strength of Macy's performance here, his ability to convey very real emotion in an understated, believable way that expresses all of the inner turmoil he is experiencing.  Consider the scene in which he is lying awake in bed, staring off into the darkness; in that one restless moment it is clear that he is grappling, not only with his immediate situation, but with everything in his life that has brought him, finally, to this point.  In that scene you find the sum total of a life of guilt, confusion and uncertainty, all of which have been successfully suppressed until now; all the things that have always been at the core of Alex's life, only now gradually breaking through his defense mechanisms and finally surfacing, demanding confrontation and resolution.  It's a complex character created and delivered by Macy with an absolute precision that makes Alex truly memorable.  It's a character to whom anyone who has ever faced a situation of seemingly insurmountable odds will be able to relate.  It's a terrific piece of work by one of the finest actors around.	Sutherland is extremely effective, as well; his Michael is despicably sinister in a way that is so real it's chilling.  It's frightening, in fact, to consider that there are such people actually walking the earth.  This is not some pulp fiction or James Bond type villain, but a true personification of evil, hiding behind an outward appearance that is so normal he could be the guy next door, which is what makes it all the more disconcerting.  And Sutherland brings it all to life brilliantly, with a great performance.	Neve Campbell looks the part of Sarah, but her performance (as is the usual case with her) seems somewhat pretentious, although her affected demeanor here just happens to fit the character and is actually a positive aspect of the film.  If only she would occasionally turn her energies inward, it would make a tremendous difference in the way she presents her characters.  `Panic,' however, is one of her best efforts; a powerful film that, in the end, is a journey well worth taking.  9/10.

As a bonus, 'Panic' delivers subtle, acerbic humor&#151;an unexpected, undeniably charming, and very welcome surprise&#151;through its bumbling, unsure-of-himself, low-key star, whose ever-cool state is enticing, especially given his line of work.The forever-great William H.

Alex, whose lust to lead a new life is obstructed by the fear of disappointing his dictating father, strikes an unwise fancy for Sarah, which ultimately leads him to understand the essence and irrefutable responsibility of being a husband to his wife and, more importantly to him, a good father to his six-year-old son, Sammy (played enthusiastically by the endearing David Dorfman).Henry Brommell's brilliant 'Panic' is something of a rarity in Hollywood seldom seen (with the exception of 2002's 'Road to Perdition') since its conception in 2000&#151;it weaves two conflicting genres (organized-crime, family drama) into a fascinating, warm hunk of movie-viewing that is evenly strong in either direction&#151;and it's one that will maintain its exceptional, infrequent caliber and gleaming sincerity for ages to come.

If I hadn't known this was such a recent release I'd have thought it came out in the mid 80's. The atmosphere and photography, as well, as the highly charged performances were what I enjoyed most.Unfortunately, the movie is really difficult to watch. There are a handful of movies that, while very obviously maybe well made are just almost to intense. That's the way I felt about Panic. It isn't gory but is very emotionally upsetting though the characters, all of them, hold an element of fascination as well.SPOILERS THROUGHOUT There is an element of gloom throughout the movie that does not let up. Of coarse, the plot, is in itself, pretty much a downer but Panic while being a very good film in a lot of ways, is so disturbing while watching that it's hard to get through it. Some movies, such as American Beauty, which it's been compared to, are disturbing but in a good way. With American Beauty I felt riveted to my seat. With Panic, after a bit, I just felt like turning it off. It made an impression on me alright, but not the way I'd have wanted.This movie is obviously meant to disturb and it did. There's not a lot to criticize in panic but it's not a movie I could give an 8, 9 or 10 to, simply because I wasn't transfixed as in other films that might be equally disturbing but contain the element of keeping you glued to your seat as well. Panic is a good movie. It is thought provoking, well acted, emotionally brutal and sad. It also has that element of complete realism and really gets you thinking about one's neighbors, friends, coworkers etc-who they really are and what secrets they maybe carrying around. I admire Panic tremendously and do plan to watch it again, it seems the type of film where the second time around might make better viewing, knowing what it's about etc but as of right now my vote is 6.5 of 10. The movie touched, it disturbed, but it also drained. As far as performances go though-10's all the way through.

Meanwhile, the 'beautiful young thing' he's become acquainted with from the waiting room outside his therapist's office, Sarah (Campbell), is becoming an obsession for him.While Alex-the-son is in a three-way scrap with Alex-the-father and Alex-the-husband, and doesn't even understand what's happening to him, his wife (ably portrayed by Tracey Ullman) despairs, his little boy worries and his newfound therapist (a subdued and plausible John Ritter) begins to get very edgy about the way Alex seems to be monitoring his routine.In a story that explores, among other things, the whole family dynamic, you'll find it all rings true. The context of the story is violent and exotic, but the relationships aren't. For example; your father is probably not a controlling and manipulative sociopath (and, you know, small mercies and all that) but even so, how many of us would find it easy to step up and admonish him, when he steps over the line? Donald Sutherland's marvelous performance as the monstrous pater shrouded in congeniality is a highlight of the movie. He actually had me shouting at the screen. And I'm British. We just don't do that ...This juxtaposition between the unfamiliar and the everyday is reinforced throughout the film. Alex leans on a wall, shooting the breeze with an acquaintance who's complaining about how hard it is for his wife to get an appointment with her doctor. Next moment, an array of weaponry is revealed in the trunk of the acquaintance's car. Alex is shopping.Really. Dig this out and watch it. You won't find the experience entirely comfortable, nor will it be an escape from the rigors of the world (because there's too much of the world in the movie) but it will make you laugh, wince, cheer and, most importantly of all, it will make you think.

Macy is at his most sympathetic and compelling here as a hit-man and loving father who wants to step out of the family business without angering his overbearing parents. Treads much of the same territory as TV's The Sopranos in terms of the mid-life crisis of a criminal theme (here too he visits a shrink) but is still worth watching thanks to some taut direction from Brommel (I look forward to what this guy directs next), an excellent script, and all around great performances. Macy is excellent as always. This is probably his best role since Fargo. Donald Sutherland is at his creepy best as the domineering father. Tracy Ullman gives a surprisingly riveting dramatic turn as Macy's wife. Young David Dorfman is excellent as Macy's bright and sensitive son (many of his lines sound ad-libbed and are wonderful). Even Neve Campell (who I usually find abhorrent) is compelling as the troubled young woman who captures Macy's eye. All of this is punctuated by a moving score and crisp pace that lead up to a predictable but still powerful climax and meaningful and touching aftermath. This film deserved a much wider release, as I suspect it would have connected with audiences. "},{"Title":"Not bad.

But I like Macy's work, so I finally gave it a look, and I was happy I did.  To be sure, humor/irony abounds in scenes that leverage the incongruity between what characters say and how they behave in the context of their knowledge (or lack thereof) of Macy's line of work.  But, as I see it, the film is about something more (fortunately).  There is far more sadness than humor in Macy's understated portrayal of Alex, the hitman at midlife who has become aware of his condition and is seeking escape/resolution in visits to a therapist (John Ritter).  The natural question, as one of the earlier user comments noted, is why has it taken Alex so long to sense that something is dreadfully wrong?  How can such an apparently nice guy be caught up in all this, and how could he have been doing it for so long?  The answer lies in his relationship with his controlling father (Donald Sutherland) and, secondarily, with his controlling mother (Barbara Bain).  The catalyst for Alex's awakening is his relationship with his own son.  Alex's dissatisfaction with the life he has lived, the lie that he has lived with his wife (Tracey Ullman)--who is unaware of Alex's work as a hitman--is crystallized in his emerging relationship with a young woman (Neve Campbell) whom he meets in the therapist's waiting room.  The events unfold more in the tradition of classical tragedy than comedy, as we follow Alex's awakening, his struggle to determine his own direction, and its inevitable conclusion.  Alex's struggles can also be seen in a broader context--a kind of allegory of modern midlife existence for many of us, when we struggle to come to terms with the life we have lived, or have failed to live, and the person we are, or have failed to become.  There is one particularly poignant scene in which Alex recalls his first murder, directed by his father.  His father accompanies him on this first assignment, giving words of encouragement as if to a child first learning to ride a bike, and gives Alex a little boost from behind to send him on his way.  It is not, after all, an easy film to watch.  But I expect this is one I will see again.

From some of the other comments about it being on cable I'm guessing it was released only on TV or in Europe maybe.Oh well, it doesn't matter. I was pleasantly surprised. William H. Macy does a good job playing a man who was taught to bottle up his emotions by his father who obviously is suppressing a lot of hatred for humanity in general. Some of the lines from Tracy Ullman and the kid were a little off, but the acting was very good all around. I'm glad to see Mr. Macy finally get a love scene since those are usually reserved for the pretty boy actors. I felt that Neve Campbell was a little miscast since I didn't really see how such an uninteresting stereotypical gen-x chick was supposed to be the catalyst for the whole middle age crisis thing. However, I do feel that she did the best she could given her limited acting abilities.The camera work is really pretty in the film, lots of hard edges and simple geometric backgrounds. What I liked most about the film was the script. A lot of films that go for the noir feel end up sounding so corny and clichéd that you just can't take the characters seriously, or they try to sugar coat everything so that mainstream audiences won't run the danger of feeling uncomfortable (*cough*..American Beauty).There are instances in this film when the script seems headed for corniness, but Mr. Macy quickly rescues it with his very realistic morose reactions. The weakest section is the sex scene with Sara the dialogue wounds really forced and I really wanted Mr. Macy to go a little more berserk when his passion was finally given an avenue through which to vent.A lot of the themes explored are similar to those in American Beauty, a film which I heartily despise, but the script and actors give the film a serious and deeper tone so the messages don't end up sounding as preachy or superficial.

Boy was I wrong. To be fair, the acting was excellent especially from Ullman, and of course Macy who manages to be cast perfectly (again) as a downtrodden, middle-aged man in a crisis. The plot, though, was another matter. Other films have ripped off lesser ones, but Panic seems to rip off major movies whose plots are already well-known. Man in a mid-life crisis, fantasises about a younger woman (already done in American Beauty). A killer sees a psychiatrist for his problems (done in Sopranos and comedically in Analyse This). Man wants to quit family business of crime (Godfather Part One and numerous other mafia movies). I mean, how cliched can a storyline get? And none of the lines were particularly noteworthy.I was surprised to see the high rating and hear that Ebert had praised it, considering that the last half hour of the film descended into inanity. Panic tries to carry itself as a black comedy but ultimately fails, there isn't remotely any of the dry humour that abounded in Fargo, and the story as said before had already been done. There are also some film noir elements thrown in like the flashbacks and voiceovers but they don't have any effect whatsoever. And dear God, the kid was almost as annoying as the one from Phantom Menace.Anyway, 5 out of 10. The only redeeming feature was Neve Campbell.  "},{"Title":"William H.

Dad begins training son very early, shooting a squirrel, to eventually become a hit man. We see a flashback of the first official hit, as a young adult, and his dad walking beside him literally high-fives him for a good job and the start of his career.  Critic Ebert has a fairly complete and accurate review of the film, but I don't quite share his praise.  After developing the conflict between his wanting to quit the business he finds so distasteful, and his father and mother chiding him for abandoning the business dad has worked so hard to build, it doesn't go to a very good place. However, maybe that's the only place it could go without making it a dark comedy, where Macy gets to quit and dad learns to take it in stride.Instead dad begins to train 6-year-old grandson to shoot and kill, again starting with a squirrel.  This while dad had contracted son, Macy, to make a hit on his shrink, thinking that was the way to subvert his intentions. But the training of the grandson was too much, Macy went and shot and killed his dad, who by now we all realize is just an evil person. So Macy either dies or goes to prison, we're not certain, and in a whimsical end we see Macy's shrink talking to someone, the camera pans, it is the young grandson. Pretty good film, different, could have been better with a better-written last 1/3 of the movie. Macy of course is good as usual, delivering his Mamet-like dialog, Sutherland is superb as the evil dad, Neve Campbell good as the 23-year-old attraction, and Ullman  ok as Macy's wife.

Panic (2000) is a classic noir and Greek/Shakespearean tragedy. Scoff not. The seed of unraveling doom starts when the father imposes his structure on an unwilling son. He is doomed by himself. The son who does what he knows is wrong to avoid confrontation with his father sows his own doom. (Hamlet hesitation.) The mother is a quiet evil of Lady Macbeth and Medusa proportions, who screws her husband and son (Oedipus). The twist is the role of the chorus as psychologist &#150; and the pulling of the chorus into the action &#150; a paradigm-cracking innovation. Macy thinks the chorus is a sounding board for his dilemma as it has been since Oedipus. But when your father tells you to kill the chorus, you implode. This cannot be! You pulled out the thread that will unravel the stinking mess that you have been denying since your first job in the family business. Additional allegory is the role of today's businessman who quietly arranges for slave labor to sew his company's sneakers (or to market cigs to kids) and who comes home to his sweet family. (This is done well in The Big Heat with Laganno who dwells on how distasteful is it for his sanctorum to be invaded by a low-class cop.) As I say, while I would have lit and directed it differently, I love the straight-forward Blue-Velvet-quiet-town ordinariness of the director's approach. It makes the truth more fun to pull out. I would love this to become a cult Blood Simple.

William H. Macy plays Alex, a typically Macyan put-upon schnook who is whipped by a sadistic, overweening father (Donald Sutherland, uncharacteristically hamming) and an icy, facelifted mother (Barbara Bain, previously unmissed). Dad keeps Alex under his thumb he's tutored him in the family business and insists that Alex stay in it till he dies. In case you haven't guessed, Alex is a hit man. And this central conflict of the movie begins not to make sense within the first five minutes. As controlling and mean as a dad may be, why would Sutherland insist on putting his son through this at the risk of screwing up a job and going to jail? Why wouldn't he hire an eager killer, or do the jobs himself? The movie never gives a satisfying explanation. Glumping around his house, Alex loves his six-year-old kid (David Dorfman, extremely cute) and wishes he had more feeling for his wife (Tracey Ullmann), a well-meaning baggage who couldn't rouse romantic ardor in a coke-stoked rapist. Of course, this is the moment when Alex runs into a succulent, screwy, counterculture-y twenty-three-year-old hottie (Neve Campbell) who, perhaps more than any hot-young-thing character in contemporary movies, comes ripped right out of the Middle-Aged Guy Screenwriter's Fantasy Handbook. Hyperarticulate and wise-beyond-her-years, she rattles off alternate psychiatric explanations for Alex's leering at her, leaving him with a Wha? look on his face. We see her effortlessly suctioning the hottest guy at a party to her, then sending him shooting back through the ionosphere without a parachute, jackknifing him with one talk-to-the-hand remark. And--for no reason than the obvious one--we see her relating to her shrink the story of her first lesbian adventure...followed shortly thereafter by offering a guy to join a threesome with her and her girlfriend. After WILD THINGS and this, hasn't the once rather fancy-shmancy Campbell, who is a trained dancer and from Canada for crying out loud, a little tired of being the bell that Pavlovianly rings America's Howard Stern desires? And then, of course, Alex has to go to...a shrink. (Bad ideas in Hollywood come in threes; God be praised, this shall be the last incarnation of this dumb gag.) There is a whole plot--well, it should be THE plot, but it's more of a subplot--about Alex being forced to whack his shrink (John Ritter). After having had only one session with the shrink, when he gets Ritter's picture from his dad as the anonymous Next Guy to Get It, Alex doesn't understand that this is his dad punishing him--making him kill someone he trusts. This seems almost absurdly implausible; and this whole story never comes into focus because there's no relationship between Alex and the shrink--they barely speak to one another throughout the entire movie. Several of our worst film critics have gnashed their teeth and rent their garments over the fact that Artisan sent this puppy straight to cable. I would suggest that Macy, Campbell, Sutherland, Ritter, Ullmann and company should write polite thank-you notes to the heads of Artisan for cutting down the movie's exposure to an audience. One can only imagine that the success of AMERICAN BEAUTY sent this one into production; let there be no more copycats of that synthetic tripe, knock on wood!

Macy plays Alex, who is a hit-man. He wants to retire, but his Dad, Michael (Sutherland) won't let him...without a fight. Alex is having a nervous breakdown and goes to a psychologist, Dr. Parks (John Ritter) When Michael hears about this, he puts out a hit on Parks.Panic was dumped on video for no reason. It's definitely a hidden gem. The whole cast is fantastic. Macy and Sutherland are perfect in their roles. Sutherland's character stands out. Even when Michael is opening a birthday present, he looks menacing.Tracy Ullman plays Alex's wife. She also does a good job at developing her character throughout the film.Panic is a movie you should look out for, if you like the actors involved.For more insanity, please visit comeuppancereviews.com "},{"Title":"How does Panic NOT work?

Having seen it, though, it was like the worst case scenario of someone directing their own writing without the benefit of a third party's eye for catching sloppy dialogue and silly plot devices.The first 75 minutes of this film's hour-and-a-half running time comprise a painfully dull mosaic of exposition made up of conversations about and references to something other than what's happening on the screen.  The reward for suffering through this hodgepodge of contrived dialogue and manufactured plot twists is a predictably goofy ending that tries too hard to be impactful and, instead, ends up as empty as the rest of the movie.I understand Neve Campbell being in this film, but what talented performers like William H. Macy and Donald Sutherland were doing within 50 miles of this stinker is beyond me.  If I must claim a silver lining, it's John Ritter's sporadic appearances.  He is one of the best actors in film today, and it's sad he's not given deeper roles.The only people I'd recommend this to is aspiring screen writers. Hopefully they'll gain confidence in their own work upon seeing the nonsense that passes off as a dramatic thriller today.

The films pacing was horrible. The script had excellent qualities and yet this director was unable to show honest believable people who had a reason to interact. I felt nothing for any of these people. This film had no resemblance to life. Even a life this weird had no real feeling. I don't understand why this tragic mess of human beings could not be made darkly funny. This movie was not comedy, dark or otherwise. I witnessed a disastrous attempt to revive the characters and every time a character showed any signs of life, that life was snuffed out and pointless. It surprises me that this film is so highly rated and the reviews are so effusive. Panic had no real passion.

William Macy does his usually stuttery blank delivery of script lines. None of the characters give you anything to care about. The kid's annoyingly precocious and whoever wrote the script obviously had none. Neve Campbell provides some tepid salacious moments (ooh, girl on girl, she's bisexual, isn't that hot). Donald Sutherland hams it up but essentially has nothing to say, and repeats it. Nothing happens that isn't telegraphed clearly. A waste of time. HBO is completely capable of producing excellent flicks (the film on the Scarsdale diet doctor is one), but this is a stinker. Waste of several good actors. Plus, there are very few therapists who put patients in the same waiting room, and very few who strike up conversations while there.

What is so great about a guy with no emotion?  *yawn*You never see Alex show emotion for anyone other than his son.  Yeah, I know that this is why his son is the only one to cause him to lose his temper (if you can call it that), I get it.Characters are undeveloped, relationships aren't given enough time to be understood.  In one scene Sarah says they won't fall in love, and the next time we see her she's talking about how his death really shook her up because they were so close?  Logic synapses abound in this film.It's like someone watched Boogie Nights and wrote this part to mimic Little Bill.  Even the scene where he loses his temper is the same as when Little Bill shoots his wife, down to the facial expression (or lack thereof). Yes, William H. Macy is good at portraying a man without emotion - been there, done that - can you say Magnolia?This movie didn't only lack emotion, it lacked substance, a good script, developed characters, and a plot.  And it certainly lacks my recommendation. )~A~ "},{"Title":"Stink bomb","Date":"22 June 2002","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":"  One of the most dreadful films ever made. It advertises itself as a comedy - not so. Macy is very effective in comedies like Fargo where he is befuddled and fritters. He can be very funny. Otherwise he generally plays supporting roles. Here he has to carry the whole film. He plays it straight and his mannerisms make your skin crawl after a while.The poor schmuck doesn't know why he's unhappy as a contract killer so he goes to a shrink. After Analyze This and The Sopranos this plot device is a little tired. The twist here is that the relationship is played seriously and the dialog is as insipid and as wandering and pointless as in real therapy.The family business of murder for hire is completely unbelievable. It is just stated with no explanation as if none were required. The protagonist has no connections with organized crime or low characters. He lives in a nice middle class neighborhood and wears a business suit everyday. He stays at home and has a part time mail order business as a cover but his wife never catches on to the fact that he has another more substantial source of income.Just awful.

Macy seems to wear the same frown he last wore in State & Main and nothing short of a bullet it seems will dislodge him from his eternal funk. Sutherland gives the usual villian performance he is so really good at. This is hardly one of the best movies to come out of Hollywood; more likely one of the usual -types schools produce lacking artistic edge and quality that sustains throughout. No, this is not a good picture. It is truly doubtful given Neve's circumstances she would (ever) fall for a frumpy Mr. Middle Age--it just isn't even plausible here, given context.

He nails long bits of dialogue in long unbroken takes. He adds so much humanity to the film.It is pointless to opine about William H. Macy. He is a titan. But, god almighty lets not forget Donald Sutherland. He is the pinnacle of evil wrapped up in sheep's clothing. The mentor of his son, in a very disreputable trade. And god, I miss John Ritter! And Neve Campbell.. be still my heart.Hit men movies are always enjoyable. What this says of humanity I don't know. But a hit man movie saturated with humanity is something yet again and I promise this combination makes for a very satisfying experience.

You get sucked into the story despite your plot qualms until you get to the end and realize you've been a witness to something stupid.I described the film to my girlfriend the next day and she said, Are you sure this wasn't a comedy?  It sounds too much like the Sopranos. Tracy Ullman?Maybe the problem was the casting. The public will accept swarthy actors with Jersey accents making their money from murder. But you can't fully support yourself on murder alone. You've got to have gambling and rackets, crooked politicians and bogus land swindles. Sutherland and Macy as father and son killing people a few times a year could never support themselves as pictured here.  The crime in this film should have been about embezzlement, or money swindled from film investors.The squirrel hunting scenes are completely ridiculous. No child of five or six shoots and kills squirrels with pistols.Tracy Ullman was wasted in this role. Donald Sutherland has been in a zillion movies. He's a good actor no matter the plot, and I guess he isn't too fussy about the films he does. William H. Macy keeps playing the same unemotional but inwardly tortured soul. I like watching him on the screen, but I don't care to see him necking with pretty young women.I can't believe that smart people with money made this movie. Some one should have said, STOP THE MADNESS! "}]
