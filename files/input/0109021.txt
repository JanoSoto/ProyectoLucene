I'm sure that those cowboys feel that those 8 seconds are like an eternity.This picture is about one of the very best at his profession, Lane Frost. The three principal players at the time this film was made, Luke Perry(Beverly Hills 90210), Stephen Baldwin(The Young Riders) and Cynthia Geary(Northern Exposure) were all at the height of exposure from popular television series' and brought a built in audience to the show.It helps by the way that Luke Perry bears an absolutely uncanny resemblance to the real Lane Frost. During the end credits there is some interview footage with the real Lane Frost so I'm sure there were a lot of oohs and aahs from the audience as the movie ended.I remember reading about Luke Perry and that his background before he became a teen heart throb was from a really tiny Ohio town. I'm sure that Perry understood the character of Lane Frost very well who hailed from a small town in Oklahoma. This film now joins other good movies about the rodeo scene, like The Lusty Men and Junior Bonner. Only difference is this one had an actual rodeo champion as a hero/protagonist.The portrayal of Lane Frost was as genuinely nice young man who rose to the top of his chosen profession through, skill, hard work, and dedication. He was doing as so few of us are privileged to do, actually make money doing what he loved. He gained a celebrity status in his field and was prey to the temptations that accompany fame. The Lane Frost, Perry gives us is a man who was very human. Doesn't detract in the least from his accomplishments. Cynthia Geary is fine as the wife who wins, loses, and wins Perry back ultimately. She's also rodeo people, the real Mrs. Frost was a barrel racing champion.And Stephen Baldwin as Tuff Hedeman who was Frost's best friend and eventual successor as bull riding champion registers well in his role.In 1994 the very year that 8 Seconds came out, professional bull riding spun out on its own as a sport with the formation of the Professional Bull Riders. It's champion in 1995 was none other than Tuff Hedeman. And in 1996 Tuff Hedeman and Lane Frost with both inducted in the PBR Ring of Honor, the equivalent of their Hall of Fame. It's a good biographical picture and should have gotten much more attention than it did.

It tells his story of living in his fathers footsteps and becoming a legend in his sport. It tells of how he met the love of his life and the ups and downs of his career full of broken bones and broken homes. A must see for anyone who knew his story, or followed Rodeo competitions. It will be enjoyed by those who like a good honest story about a real person.The acting was really good here and although Luke Perry was a huge star on Beverly Hills 90210, to me this is by far his best acting role. Stephen Baldwin is th only guy I wish they had replaced, those Baldwin's (with the exception of Alec in some roles) are just bad actors. The movie was good production wise, and whoever is responsible for shooting and arranging the bull-riding sequences did a great job too.It has a lot of heart. Lane is a great guy and everyone loves him, but he wants his dad to be as proud of him as the rest of the world is, doesn't every boy that looks up to their dad deserve to be told how proud they are. The movie shows that it takes a lot sometimes to know what love is, and it truly shows that following your dreams can make and often break a person.This movie was a good little drama. It was slow at times and thats what hurt it for me, it has some very dated stuff which makes it cheesy. I wish they had made it a little more exciting, but it has tons of dialog and lovey dovey appeal. It is often labeled as an action and other than the bull-riding it is not action at all, and its often called a family movie, but although it has a pg-13 rating, I think it is not family friendly, not for younger kids anyway.If you like sad drama's give it a try, or if you like rodeo stuff. I still can't give it more than 3 stars cause it didn't do a whole lot for me.Yee Haw!

I was a bit disappointed that they didn't mention that the real Lane Frost was a strong Christian, that they made his character in the movie have conflicts with his father when in reality they had a wonderful relationship, and that they included a cheating scene which never happened (the real Lane and Kelly Frost did split up for awhile, but there never was any cheating done by either side)I recommend this movie, especially if you have a language filter on your player P although do be forewarned that there are some 'references' as well.

As Lane works his way up the rodeo circuit with his best friend Tuff Hedeman (Stephen Baldwin), he meets Kelly Kyle (Cynthia Geary), a pretty barrel-race rider with whom he falls in love. Lane and Kelly marry, and while Lane's dedication to rodeo and its fans earns him a devoted following, it also keeps him away from Kelly and threatens to sink their relationship. Lane's hard work pays off when he wins the 1987 world championship, but the danger of the sport catches up with him two years later, when he dies as a result of an accident during competition. This movie was made to commemorate the life of Lane Frost. Lane was the typical boy. At a young age he started to bull ride. He traveled around with his best friends and he made his way up the rodeo circuit. He followed his dreams. They made the movie to show that Lane lived his life to the fullest. He made mistakes just like the normal person. Also that Lane died doing what he loved. He did not let the fear of death stop him from doing what he loved to do. He had his minor injuries every now and then, but he did not let that stop him also. This just shows us that if a bull rider could do it we could do it also.Growing up always loving animals the movie intrigued me to want to watch it. With loving horses and cows I knew that 8 Seconds would be a movie that I would love. After watching the movie I saw that it was about more than just the fact of rodeos. The movie taught me to always follow your dreams no matter the risk. I believe there is no better way to die if I am doing what I love!

Before I really say anything, I'd like to mention that if you have something against 'cowboys' or 'country life' then don't watch it. Its about cowboys, bull riding, horses, country life, country jokes and yes some of it is crude. The acting is brilliant, the story line is strong and true to the real story of Lane, with casting that really complements the story. It is a 90's film so its dated, but this only makes it seem more honest and true. The country lifestyle is shown well and I guess this is part of the reason a lot of people don't like it - country jokes and country boys are often crude and seemingly disrespectful, and for someone who doesn't really understand it the 'redneck' stereotype can certainly sway opinion.

The title of the movies explains it all. It's the longest eight seconds of a rider's life. The movie is a true story about a bull rider named Lane Frost, whose life was taken from him by a bull. This movie touches my heart in so many ways. When I watched 8 Seconds, I saw Lane's love for his friends and family, his wife, and his passion to ride bull.The movie starts off slow by going off with his two best pals to start the journey. Tuff Hedeman, who was the funny guy of the group and always has a smart remark, was an important part to this movie. Even though it seemed like he gave Frost a hard time, he cares so much for him. When Lane first got hurt and he was laying in the recovery tent, Hedeman came up to him and gave him confidence that he was the best bull rider and all he needs to do is to `Cowboy Up.' One year later after Frost's death, Hedeman was in the big show and rode the best ride ever. When his eight seconds was up, Hedeman rode an extra eight in his memory for his buddy. Cody Lambert, who was the poetic guy of the group, wrote about their experiences along the way. Lane's family meant everything to him. In the movie Clyde, Lane's dad plays a jerk. Clyde (James Rebhorn) never gives Lane any compliments about his bull riding. This bothers Lane, but he never really says anything. Lanes tries everything to please his dad.During Lane's bull riding and going to rodeos, he meets his wife Kelly Frost (Cynthia Geary) who was a barrel rider in the beginning who hated bull riding. At first, she gave Lane the cold shoulder, but he never gave up and finally she caved in. With all his fame and glory he became like all other stars, a cheating fool. Like every movie, there has to be a love scene, but in this movie Frost shows how much one can love a person though. Even though he cheated on his wife, he drove himself sick until they got back together. Watching this and knowing what he was doing made me want to punch Luke Perry for being such a jerk.The main point of the movie is Frost's passion for bull riding. His father was his inspiration to ride bulls, and he wanted to be the best just like him. He started out in the high school rodeo, then went out on the road traveling with the guys. Rodeo to rodeo he kept climbing to the top. Towards the end, Frost challenges the bull Red Rock, who has never been ridden. Frost started out rough, but in the end he defeated Red Rock. At the big show in Cheyenne, competing against the best and riding the best ride of his life made this movie so good. He was about to win the championship, but the bull charged at him. The bull stabbed Frost with his horns which made a rib pierce his heart.  Luke Perry was the best actor they could have picked for this part. I don't even know who else they could have chosen.Would I see this movie again? Better believe I will, even  buying my own copy of the movie. The movie blends well together. I'm sure there are some parts of the movie that was exaggerated, but considering it was a true story I think the movie made its point.

Instead they will cringe at badly done accents and wonder where the boy's likability  went. No loved one is spared, and the writers seemed to go out of their way to transform Lane's Justins from leather to clay. Why does the media tear down our heroes?Luke Perry's affected accent borders on parody and Cynthia Geary, (formerly Shelly on Northern Exposure), is downright unappealing as Lane's wife, Kellie. All too often TV actors lack a certain texture to make it on the big screen, and the casting here proves it. I suspect the powers that be were trying to cash in on the popularity of Perry's and Geary's television shows. The late Red Mitchell, a genuine Texan, and film actor, was excellent as the poetry spouting  Cody Lambert. Cowboy poetry is a real art form, but the real Cody Lambert wasn't known for his poetical abilities.Further evidence that Perry is no Lane Frost comes from the scene where he tosses his hat, brim down, on a chair. No self respecting cowboy would ever do that! (In fact, it was a rapid glance test for sniffing out coca-cola cowboys back in the days following Urban Cowboy when everyone and their brother was trying to pass as a real cowboy. On that subject, a lot of rodeo cowboys are treated with disdain by those from working ranches. Rodeo is an extremely expensive hobby and most real cowboys can't afford to ride any circuit other than the pasture fence line.) The vast majority of rodeo cowboys, and wage riding cowboys, for that matter, end up so stoved up that they are old men by the age of 40, something the film gave a passing nod to. Lane really did wear a wild turkey feather in his hatband, but he wasn't hurt by Red Rock, who was actually a popular bull to draw. The trailer in the picture was an insult to the man, and they did split up for awhile, but it wasn't over cheating. Tuff really did manage to hang on for 8 more seconds in honor of Lane during his ride at the 1989 National Rodeo Finals. You can say well, heck, it is only a movie, cut it some slack, but I say this is about a real man who really touched a lot of people's hearts, and those that don't know any better now only get this fractured view of him. He deserved a lot better.Then there is the way family members are portrayed. If one believes this movie, the whole Frost family had closeness issues... and that is just with the parents. Lane's siblings are ignored all together. In real life, Elsie is generous and the picture of Christian charity, and bless her for it, but this film showed her and Clyde in a pretty bad light, and doesn't say much for his real life wife either.Still, there are some interesting moments, and an absolutely priceless credit sequence where we get to see the real Lane Frost in action. Your heart can leap into your mouth watching him get busted up by those bulls and you may cheer when he gets up and walks away with that infectious grin of his. If you want to be a bullrider, you may even give it a rethink after seeing that even a champion gets stomped every once in awhile.I always bust out sobbing while those precious minutes roll by, but it is from seeing Lane ride again, and being mentally transported back in time. Those were exciting and very stressful years, and I frankly resent the director's attempt to force us into reaching for the tissues by the choice in music over the credits. (Typical country tearjerkers.) Instead of walking away in contemplation, or in marvel of Lane's life, we are left on a very big downer, a box office killer and further proof someone was asleep on the job. Lane would not have wanted that for us.Overall, I give it low marks for the mauling of a genuine American Hero, but qualified high marks for that credit sequence!

THAT is the Lane Frost America knew, not this unpleasant Hollywood creation which tarnishes the image of everyone who was real in Lane's life.Lane Frost's impact is still being felt, due, in part,to this motion picture. True, it is good that it brought Lane to younger generations, but at what cost? Did we really need another biopic creating a hero with feet of clay? It almost feels as if cynical Hollywood couldn't cope with the light that was Lane Frost, so they had to pull him down into the mud, and recast him in their jaded images.For instance, Clyde Frost, Lane's father, is portrayed in a particularly bad light, having him jealous of his son and withholding his love and approval. This movie padre pushes Lane so hard that he practically forces him into his fatal date with destiny, never deigning to make an appearance at the rodeo until Lane was gone and Tuff made his famous 16 second ride. This cheapens Lane's image, making his love and generosities toward his parents seem shallow and calculating. Clyde deserved better treatment. So did Elsie, who comes across as a woman blowing in the wind, too tied to her husband to be supportive of her son. Where, for pities sake was the Christian compassion so evident in the real Frost household? The film completely ignored Lane's siblings; sister Robin and brother Cody, and made his wife, Kellie, a cheating strumpet. I think if Lane were with us today, he would object to the way this film tarnished his finely crafted image.

Natalie, now 19, saw it and remembered it from her young childhood. She said she thought I would like it. After I watched the movie I asked her why she liked and remembered it so well. She said it was because she likes bull riding. Quite a comment from a 99 pound girl!!Luke Perry is Lane Frost who from a very young age wanted to be a champion bull rider. The movie concentrates on the period in the 1980s when he and his friends traveled all over the southwest in a car, driving from one rodeo to another. Frost was known for his friendliness, big smile, and always willing to help out. And also pay attention to the fans, especially the younger ones.Cynthia Geary (of Northern Exposure fame) is Kellie, a champion barrel racer. At one rodeo the two of them met, soon became more than friends and later married. A central figure in Lane's life was James Rebhorn as his dad Clyde Frost. We see that Clyde, although clearly proud of his son, hardly ever gave Lane praise, but instead often told him that he needed to get tougher, to do better. Even as Lane was approaching world champion status as a bull rider. This had a negative effect and Lane became moody and hard to be around at times.Another key character was Stephen Baldwin as the uneven tempered Tuff Hedeman. As part of the byline at the end of the movie the real Tuff credits Lane with his successful transition in life.Good movie, has a lot of bull riding and a good dramatic story.SPOILERS Anyone who knows the history of this story also knows that Lane Frost met an untimely death in 1989, ironically just a few months after Natalie was born. He has just had a successful ride and jumped onto the ground. The bull turned and gored him such that a rib broke and punctured a major artery near his heart. He died there in the rodeo arena of excessive bleeding. He was still in his 20s.

That day was his best ride and I will love too shake his hand when I get to that fine ole' place up there. I will be a bull rider when I am older in the pbr although I am a girl and I will ride for him! I will make that 8.o seconds or however long it does take to make me feel good about showing you I care. I have never met you but I feel like I know you. You will always be in my heart and I hope everyone who see's this feels the same way about lane frost or you shouldn't be here, if you ain't a cowgirl who care's you should still care about the guy who lived his life for rodeo and made a line of respect for everyone in the pbr. love, taylor hanson "},{"Title":"Luke Perry is truly genuine","Date":"2 December 1998","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Sport","Review":"  I really enjoyed Luke Perry's performance in this movie.

I simply have a hard time empathizing with a person who has to prove his manhood by torturing a poor animal.  I was saddened a little by his death, but I almost cheered when the bull nearly castrated him!  Simply paybacks is what I think.There is a deeper story than that, however.  If Luke Perry indeed represented Lane Frost pretty well, then I must admit Lane Frost wasn't that bad of a guy.  I thought Perry did a pretty good job (despite my very low expectations) and the relationship between him and his love interest is pretty realistic from my standpoint.  Not a great movie, but enjoyable if you're in the mood for a sad drama and have a little bit of country in you.Although I must say that if you are a country fan and you don't feel like watching the movie or hate rodeo, the soundtrack is still pretty good as far as country movie soundtracks go.  Not quite as good as the soundtrack for Maverick, but I thoroughly enjoy them both.

Since the Karate Kid's director made this movie, I thought it would be really great. I wouldn't make a convict watch this movie. There were more dirty jokes/scenes than I ever expected. I bet there's cowboys out there who are EMBARRASSED by this movie. Lane Frost starts out as a nice guy, but he turns into a (pardon the pun) bull-headed, conceited jerk overnight. The reason I hate it so much is it's so danged depressing. I mean, in some movies, the hero DOES become a conceited jerk, but they grow out of it, and they certainly don't end up dying in the end. I have no idea idea how long it was, but it felt like THREE DAYS. This is NO exaggeration, it just stinks. I give it a bucket of bull manure.

Two cowpokes travel around in a Cadillac, hanging around in bars boozing and chasing women. Then the action picks up when they go to rodeos. Oh, boy! Just what I wanted to see. Some brainless cowboy getting on a steer, or whatever they are called, and riding it around an arena covered in cow flop with a group of other cowpokes yelling, Ride 'im, cowboy!, and Yeehaw!. A must see for all you Garth Brooks fans out there. YAAAAAHOOOOOOO!!!!!!! "}]
