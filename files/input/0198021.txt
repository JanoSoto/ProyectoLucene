I admire the fact that a wonderful movie was created without nudity, very little violence or excess profanity (were there 4-letter words in the movie?). I admit, it's somewhat of a fantasy that good things happen only to good people and bad things to bad people - but it makes you feel good about the outcome all the same.

This is exactly what happened to me when I sat down to watch Where The Heart Is.Within the first few moments of the film, I knew it would be special; this reason is Natalie Portman. Portman has a unique look of innocence that cannot be pulled off by many actresses as she does with her character, Novalee Nation. I couldn't wait for the next scene she would be in because of the physical beauty she possesses and the beauty in the performance she gives.Complimenting the performance of Portman is that of Ashley Judd. As I was watching Judd and Portman, I could tell that these are two actresses who knew exactly what the other would say and do the moment before it was actually done. Ashley Judd lights up the screen every SINGLE time she arrives in a scene. It is a no wonder she is the best at what she does.Another reason I liked Where The Heart Is relates to the double story lines of Portman's character determined to raise her daughter by herself while trying to make a career in photography. The other storyline revolved around the ex-boyfriend trying to make a name for himself in country music.The cool thing is that these are hobbies of mine and whenever I saw a camera or heard country music it brought a smile to my face. Not only are these hobbies of mine but they are both testaments to what can be done if one works hard enough to attain a specific goal. The story is one that will take you on a journey through the depths of your heart, soul, and end up in your head relaying the message that Where The Heart Is is a phenomenal movie.Where The Heart Is is not only my favorite film but the best film of 2000.

City of Angels, Message in a Bottle, and Where the Heart Is all have that special ingredient that just grabs the viewer and holds him or her until the very last tear flows from their eye.   Natalie Portman is very well cast in her role as Novalee Nation, a 20 year old pregnant woman who decides to move to California with her boyfriend.  The sad thing is, when her and her boyfriend stop at a Wal-Mart in the middle of Oklahoma, he leaves her behind, and moves on without her.      The movie follows her life after she realizes that her boyfriend has left her stranded, and is not coming back.  A very unique screenplay allows this movie to radiate a love for Novalee, and allows the viewers to develop a friendship with her.        Lexie Coop (Ashley Judd) becomes Novalee's best friend when they meet in the hospital after Novalee has her baby. Where the Heart Is has everything it takes to be a great movie.  The choice of actors is superb, and the direction is wonderful.  Of course with every movie made, at least all that I have viewed, there was a few things wrong with the movie.  For instance, Novalee's mother abandoned her when she was about 8 years old.  Right after she gives birth to her baby, her mother shows up by her side, and quite frankly, nothing ever becomes of that scene.  It's completely irrelevant.  Also, there is the whole living in Wal-Mart for six weeks thing to consider.  I mean can that really happen?      At any rate, by no means should these `mistakes' thwart your intention of watching this movie, it a real tearjerker, and I believe the best date movie since For Love of the Game.

Portman is literally stranded at the local Wal-Mart and then becomes a national celebrity when she gives birth late one night at the store. Local gardener Stockard Channing and her live-in lover (Richard Jones) take the youngster and her child in as Portman gets the opportunity to work for Wal-Mart. Immediately we are introduced to a whole host of vivid characters. There is nurse Ashley Judd who is rearing five young children of her own, department store photographer Keith David and shy librarian James Frain who is taking care of his alcoholic older sister (Margaret Ann Hoard). And we even get a short glimpse of Portman's trashy, money-hungry mother (an electrically-charged cameo for Sally Field). Time passes, and Portman experiences life, love, triumph, tragedy and everything in between as she makes the small Oklahoma town her own. Smart drama that never loses its way and stays interesting due to Portman's show-stopping performance. The rest of the cast is right on key as well as fellow Heat alum Judd does a deceptively deep and heartfelt job. The movie works due to a steady pace, strong direction and a totally under-appreciated script. 4 stars out of 5.

I have also never cared much for Sally Fields movies. Perhaps I always think of her from the Bandit movies... My first impression from all the trailers was that Where the Heart Is was noting more than another chick-flik that I would no doubt find well-produced, but forgettable. I was wrong. Natalie Portman registers a great performance as a meek and down-trodden pregnant teen who learns early in life that our lives can change with every breath. Ashley Judd puts in an Oscar worthy performance in her supporting role as the older, married friend who has trouble finding the right man to be the father of her children. Stockard Channing plays the unforgettable Sister Husband who takes the young girl and her newborn child in, and Sally Fields makes a momentary appearance as the young girl's absentee mother, one of the highlights in the film. Fields has deepened my respect for her as an actress with five minutes of film time like no other actor/actress has in a long time. Joan Cusack appears as a talent manager in the film's sub-plot and is phenomenal in her brief on screen time as well. Yes, there are men in the film, veteran David Keith among them, but for the most part, this film relies on the vision of the world through the eyes of it's female leads. I loved this film- the comedy, the drama, the love story... I laughed, and although I hate to admit it, being a tough guy and all, I cried- several times- during this wonderful film about learning to be content with what we have and learning to appreciate how unique and special everyone and everything is.

The story has a country flavor, plenty of country music and a story that could serve as the film version of the typical lyrics of any country music CD.  It is replete with bad decisions, bad luck and tragedies at every turn.  It is sappy, corny, stereotypical, and unfortunately full of the types of things that really happen in rural America.  Despite this seething despondency, it has an upbeat fatalism that suggests that at least for some of the people, the struggle against bad breaks and hard times pays off.The story follows the life of Novalee Nation (Natalie Portman), poor young girl setting out to start a new life with her no account boyfriend.  When Novalee makes a rest stop at a Wal-Mart in Oklahoma, he ditches her, literally leaving her there barefoot and pregnant.  Having only five dollars to her name, she takes up residence in the Wal-Mart and ultimately has the baby there.  She becomes a minor celebrity and she is adopted by the Welcome Wagon lady.  The remainder of the film examines the various relationships and experiences she has in this small town over the next seven or eight years.The story is charming and steeped in sentiment.  The character development of Novalee is excellent, although Director Matt Williams could have spent more time on some of the supporting characters, especially Sister Husband (Stockard Channing).  To his credit, the film was nicely shot, and the tornado scene was fabulous.Natalie Portman's performance was her best to date.  She played the part with a near helpless determination that made her a very attractive and lovable character.  Her southern accent was terrible, but her portrayal of the rural southern attitude was on target.  Though the part didn't have a lot of range, she was extremely effective with the emotional element, and elicited great sympathy and admiration for her response to her desperate situation.Stockard Channing was wonderful as the eccentric Welcome Wagon lady.  I would have liked to see this part expanded, just to see more of Channing.  She was enchantingly warm and peculiar.  James Frain was also very good as Forney.  He made the character very interesting and affable.  He continues to be a solid supporting actor who has shown himself to be extremely versatile (Hilary and Jackie, Reindeer Games, Titus).  Ashley Judd added another fine performance to her resume, with a free spirited portrayal of Lexie.This was a nice story with an agreeable and upbeat ending.  I rated it a 7/10.  Add a point if you are a woman or if you have ever lived in a mobile home.  It will find its most enthusiastic audience with women due to its extreme sentimentality, but it is not so `female' that it can't be enjoyed by men, making it a good date movie.

After giving birth to the baby in the store, she is swindled and abandoned by her mother (Sally Field) but survives and flourishes thanks to the kindness of some rather eccentric strangers.So far, so good. Very enjoyable. But the last 45 minutes or so really unravelled rather quickly. I questioned the need to continually bring us back to Willie Jack's (the baby's father) attempts to get a singing career going. None of his scenes really served to advance the plot in any way, and quite frankly, the guy was a loser who abandoned his pregnant girlfriend. I didn't care what happened to him - even though some of what happened was poetic justice - and the movie could have been shortened by 20 or 30 minutes - without losing a thing - if all his scenes had been simply cut. I also felt that it was totally unnecessary to include (albeit - thankfully - only for a few minutes) a theme about child molestation. Where did that come from and why? It made a relatively enjoyable movie very heavy, and it was a heaviness that - for me at least - never really disappeared. The end of the movie (revolving around the relationship between Novalee and Forney (James Frain) was also telegraphed quite early on. Having made those criticisms, the real highlight of the movie for me was Natalie Portman as Novalee. I wasn't familiar with this young actress until now, but she was marvellously cast as the sweet, innocent, naive young Novalee, and then showed a wonderful capacity to show her character evolve into a mature and independent young woman. (I have to say that, while the movie seemed to be trying to say she was a great mother, she seemed to spend a lot of time away from little Americus, but that's a minor point.) Portman was excellent, and I will look forward to seeing her again.This rates a 6/10. Would have been higher, except for the weak second half.

Emotionally effective teen girls, teen pregnancy, lost hope, and lack of parental support is sadly a part of today's society and this movie shows life isn't A-OK all the time. There are downsides, upsides, and even a zig-zagging path that comes along in life. This movie shows that something good can lead to something bad in a heartbeat, and while tragic, the movie sometimes eases up, but you can tell simultaneously really wants to have a good story and scenes that stay true to life's unpredictable set up.Natalie Portman is amazing in this. No other female actress could portray a role of gratitude, emotion, and bring life to the character in a way she did on screen in this. Her acting skills flow fluently throughout this movie and it makes you cringe at points when stuff goes unexpectedly. Its a sad movie. But it's a beautiful sad movie, not like a movie that is so miserable its unenjoyable. Where the Heart Is also doesn't establish a droning effect which most movies include now. Its fluent and highly realistic.Novalee Nation (Portman) is a pregnant 17 year old fleeing with her boyfriend from Tennessee to California. When Novalee stops at Wal-Mart, her boyfriend abandons her and leaves her stranded. Novalee makes Wal-Mart her shelter after being locked in after closing when going in the bathroom because of sickness due to her pregnancy. She lives undetected for an unbelievable six weeks. Novalee meets a young man named Forney (James Frain) who's life was in jeopardy because of his alcohol addiction and his choice to dropout of college.Novalee goes into labor and gives birth in the Wal-Mart and becomes a celebrity for her actions of sheltering in the store. Novalee wakes up in the hospital where she names her baby Americus showing she is a strong women of many talents. Much to her surprised, Novalee gets an unexpected visit from her mother (Sally Field) who agrees to hold to the $500 given to Novalee from the president of Wal-Mart and to have them both share an apartment. However after agreeing to pick her up the next day, the mother flees with the $500 leaving Novalee and Americus stranded.The events go on and on to the point that its hard to leave off on just one without spoiling something else. Its definitely a movie with twists and turns of the many, but the twists and turns never go the way you'd expect. For an underrated, solemn drama it has great potential which it lives up too. It also goes on the record for being one of the saddest movies I've seen next to Bicentennial Man and My Girl.

While I agree that she did a good job, she just wasn't compatible with my mental image of Novalee. The Novalee described in the book was overweight. One thing I absolutely did not see the point of was changing the number she was afraid of from 7 (as it was in the book) to 5 (in the movie). Also, I wondered why they had Sister Husband give her the Buckeye tree instead of Benny Goodluck, they could have made room for his minor character. Stockard Channing was great as Sister Husband. Sally Fields did great at her short stint as Novalee's trailer trash mom. And the actor who played Forney Hull did a wonderful job. In my mind, Ashley Judd did a great job as Lexi Coop, but again, my mental image of Lexi Coop was somewhat different, I certainly hadn't imagined her that pretty.

I think maybe I'm supposed to learn that women do the stupidest things all the time... that some of them are bound to choose a mate based on sexuality and then wonder why they're being abused and that a few lucky gems get wonderful men (at least they're convinced of that) and then either kick the bucket or tell these men to get lost because they're feeling unworthy.  That was all that was to be learned by this movie... horrible insight at best.  This movie doesn't do women (or anybody for that matter) justice.

The heroine is a perfect example of a taker. She is oblivious to the wants and needs of those around her, while taking advantage of them for her own benefit. Her only positive quality seems to be that she is cute. You never see her giving of herself, either to those who have given to her or to those she meets who are in less fortunate circumstances. I know that some viewers will think that I'm being harsh, but if you feel this way, then I suggest that you rewatch the movie and make a note of each time she does a selfless thing or tries to pay someone back for what she has received from them. She basically wanders through the film in an airheaded daze...Oh, was that guy doing all those things and taking care of my baby because he liked me? OK, I'll give him a mercy-f*** and then dump him.

The high rating was undoubtedly due to emotional and seldom-used themes explored in Where the Heart Is, but this cannot disguise the movie's incredible lack of continuity and poor acting.(Spoilers ahead)To be blunt, Natalie Portman cannot act.  The scene where she first has contractions (in the Wal-mart bathroom with the little girl nearby) was terrible!  Novalee was supposed to be in at least a _little_ pain, but all Portman does is say Aaaah twice at a normal conversational volume.  Patently unconvincing.  And I don't think any of the other actors will be winning any awards either.All the movie's advertising harped on the problems that Novalee would have raising the child.  When it's clear that the child will have a happy home about 1/3 through the movie, it's the movie that is having the problems, the first of which is the incredible ease with which Novalee recovers from the abandonment(about 15 minutes of movie time).  Most of the rest of the scenes manage to move the timeline along without advancing the plot.   Americus, the child, has only marginal importance in the second half of the movie.  (and who the heck thought of Americus and Novalee's reasoning behind the name?  Aya!)  It seems like the writers had difficulty trying to make a story long enough for a movie.  The last 2/3 of the movie consists of several unrelated incidents, which culminate in true love.   A good example is the incredibly contrived tornado scene.  It's so stupid!  To generate some suspense, Novalee of course has to leave the shelter when the tornado is 10 m away, and nearly get sucked into the twister.  Boy, it sure left me wondering whether she would survive.  The scene's purpose was to kill off Sister, but even though I liked the character, it didn't seem to matter very much.They follow the music career of Willy (who abandoned Novalee), but it never has any bearing on the rest of the movie.  There's plenty of other filler (the worst was Forney explaining to Americus how chocolate milk and whipped cream are made. Banal and pointless.  The last line of that scene was a slayer).This movie also seems to have a contradiction.  Novalee's problems started when Willy and she had sex before being truly committed to each other.  Yet, she and Forney also have sex before she is willing to be committed, and this intercourse is viewed positively (I guess since they are together at the end).  So it's not smart to have sex outside of marriage except if it's to someone you like but won't see again?To sum up, the movie is a patchwork of scenes that are mostly uncoordinated and irrelevant.  It's not campy, but it's good for a few laughs.  Or cries of agony in a normal conversational tone.

No offense to the reviewers who have regarded the movie Where the Heart Is as such, but ya'd think after 40+ years of the women's movement, such terms would have long gone out with the bath water - or should I say toilet water?? No matter. In this reviewer's opinion, brilliant author Billie Letts' novel Where the Heart Is was an engaging and enriching reading experience that had all the ingredients for a film equally so (as the films Hud and The Last Picture Show were to Larry MacMurty's novels). Alas, in this reviewer's opinion, the movie Where the Heart Is, did N-O-T NOT do justice to Letts' novel. The script was an amateurishly condensed version of the novel, a scatter-shod hodgepodge that left a lot of loose ends flying in the breeze (speaking of breezes, the tornado scene was downright stupid, especially that F - 5 funnel concoction; the funnel in MGM's The Wizard of Oz - a nylon stocking pulled over a Slinky toy - looked 100 times more realistic). If anything made this movie the least bit watchable, it was the incredible cast that deserved a much better material to work with. Natalie Portman was a brilliant choice to cast as Novalee, the hero of the story even though her Southern accent was way over the top. The most remarkable performance was that of James Frain as Forney Hull, the librarian who delivered Novalee's baby and grew to love Novelee more than Novelee loved herself. I don't believe any other actor on the planet Earth could have played the role of Forney with more realism and sensitivity as Mr. Frain, who is a genius of his craft. To have had Forney deliver Novalee's baby in the Wal Mart would have made a far more touching scene than that camera fade-out after Forney smashes unscathed through a plate-glass window while Novalee shrieks on the floor.In this day and age, movies of the past are constantly being remade; if anyone decides to remake Where the Heart Is, let's hope there's a script that will do Letts' novel much better justice!

This is one of those movies where someone could argue with me up and down how bad it is and I wouldn't care because I adore it. I've seen it dozens of times but it had been awhile so watching it again was a delight all over. I read the book years ago too and the film is very close to the book. The characters and story and drama and comedy and romance is near perfect. It is just completely entertaining and touching and so well acted. I am certain that this will be a classic in the years to come. Films to me are meant to be entertainment. That is the ultimate goal. There are exceptions to that of course (art, education, theories, knowledge) films can be all these things but I love when a movie is just simple and entertainment and Where The Heart Is is exactly that. I love these characters and their interaction and the things that happen to them over the course of the film. The soundtrack is also very good and the setting of the small town just really warms your heart. It is everything you could expect and then some and always leaves me smiling.Natalie Portman is a star. She has been a star since she was just a little girl and she is still a star today. This was when I really noticed her for the first time as an actress because she is absolutely endearing in this role. She is simple but so far from stupid and her characters goes through such an incredible arc through the course of the film. She might be one of my favourite movie characters. Ashley Judd is fantastic as Portman's best friend and a struggling single mother. She actually gets a huge story arc herself and its often moving and hard to watch and uplifting in the end. Their chemistry is terrific and Judd is phenomenal. Stockard Channing adds a level of expertise to the film as the lovable Sister Husband. She becomes a surrogate mother to Portman and although her role is less substantial, its important and a great part. James Frain is fantastic in a subtle brooding sort of way as the brilliant and tortured soul Forney. Frain also has a great story arc and his chemistry with Portman seems odd at first and then completely wins you over. Joan Cusack and Dylan Bruno round out the supporting cast and both are truly outstanding. Some might say these characters are a little cookie-cutter but the film covers such a wide span of time and they go through so much that you'll become completely attached to them.Considering how much happens and how much time the film covers, the pacing is near perfect. It never feels rushed and makes sense and is believable even in the most ridiculous sense. The film feels genuine and honest and fun and you can't ask for more than that from a movie like this. I think its a complete shame that Matt Williams, best known as a producer, didn't do a lot of directing after this. He holds everything together and keeps everything flowing nicely and while the film doesn't exactly stand out in style, it is still no small feat to hold it together with very bold characters. If you have not seen the Wal-Mart Baby movie...please see it. It is one that I cannot recommend enough. You will laugh, cry, rejoice and meet some really cool folks.

I was totally won over by Novalee and a town full of wonderfully different characters.

Oh well,  can't please 'em all!!!  I fell instantly in love with this very likable story about a girl's five year journey in eastern Oklahoma.  Novalee Nation could be anyone we know,  a frightened pregnant teenager who was on her way from Tennessee to California with her boyfriend.  When she asks him to pull off the road at an Oklahoma Wal-Mart store so she can go to the bathroom,  her boyfriend,  Willy Jack drives away and leaves her.  There is no family to call,  for Novalee was abandoned by her mother at the age of five.  She has nothing.  She is pregnant and totally alone,  with only $5.55 to her name.  For several weeks,  she has no choice but to live in the Wal-Mart,  where there is food,  facilities and shelter.  During the course of time,  she meets a good hearted woman named Sister Husband (played winningly by Stockard Channing),  her good friend Mr. Sprock, the weird but wonderful town librarian Forney Hull, (who IS James Frain??? He was perfect for this role,  beautiful and benevolent.)and Lexie Coop (the most sparkling performance from Ashley Judd I've ever seen) a nurse aide at the hospital Novalee and the baby recover in.  In these people,  Novalee finds family,  and in this small Oklahoma town,  she finds home.  I read the book by Billie Letts just a week or two after seeing the movie,  and the film is very faithful.  There are those who may dismiss this as the typical chickie flick,  or as too sentimental and too corny.  But I think this story stands out with a much more important something to say.  It's not all about kindness and goodness,  there are appropriate helpings of tragedy as well,  in the forms of a killer tornado, the alcoholism and cirrhosis that claim the life of Forney's sister,  and most shockingly,  a boyfriend of Lexie's who ends up being every single mother's nightmare.  I guess this is just my cup of tea,  a story about people,  about how they cope with all of the problems of life and how after they are knocked down,  they pick themselves up,  brush themselves off and go on.  In this five year span,  Novalee transforms from a terrified,  lonely, friendless 17 year old girl to a successful and self-assured 22 year old woman who has a definite sense of who she and her family are.  Natalie Portman did a beautiful job.

Natalie Portman and Ashley Judd are both very good as single mothers trying to raise their children in Oklahoma.  It is interesting to see both ladies grow as the movie progresses.  Portman's character, Novalee, starts off as a pregnant teenager who is abandoned by her boyfriend in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart.  She goes from being a scared young mother to being a strong independent woman. At the same time Judd's character, Lexie, starts out as a single mother of 4 who auditions several men to be the father of her brood.  After a devastating experience she realizes that he has been drawn to the men in her life for selfish reasons.

I suppose I should start off by confirming my enjoyment of this movie.  Indeed, I did have a fine time watching it.And now for your pleasure, my thoughts are free for the picking...WHERE THE HEART IS is a heart-warming, heart-tugging, heart-lightening, heart-bursting film of love and life.What you get is a simple story of Novalee Nation, a 17 years old who is quite afraid of the unlucky number 5 and who is quite pregnant.  She goes on a cross country trip to California with her boyfriend, stops at an off-the-road Walmart for a pit stop, and finds herself having arrived at her destination.  It is NOT golden California, but the middle of nowhere, America.  Her would-be musician boyfriend had left her behind, and if you're thinking it's an accident, it's not.From here on, Novalee's life will never be the same as before, or ever after.  For here in the pleasant town of Sequoyah, Oklahoma is where she finds an odd gathering of wonderful souls who take her in as one of their own.  Novalee has found what she had always been looking for a home, loving family and friends, and a better way to spend her life.  All of these are here in the place of her abandonment, and not California, and not with her boyfriend.Throughout this moving picture of wonderful emotions and sweet incidents are quiet humor made by the interesting characters and their peculiar styles.Although at times, this film is easily predictable in its premises, and the individuals in it are not allowed to developed fully their potential as characters, WHERE THE HEART IS was never meant to be anything more than the dream that it is.  It is nothing, but a dream.  One that is set in the little world of Sequoyah where kindness still is, hopes exists, and the people care.Don't think you know what you're getting yourself into when you rent this movie because it will take you for a surprisng ride.  It may seem corny to some, but this too has its value as does everything else.  Chick flick, you say?  It'll be the best one you see.  I promise, he he.What makes a good movie is a lot of factors to consider.  One way to determine this is by its audience response, and the smiles on the faces of the people walking out of the theater is testimony to the fact that WTHI has had a job well-done.  The happy thoughts it creates in our minds should be commended in a time of very scarce little content and happiness.By the way, Ashley Judd and Natalie Portman are the sweetest ladies to grace the silver screens in recent memory.  Don't you agree?  ...yeah, yeah...just nod...that's right....very good, glad you agree too.

Ruby was about a PWT girl who was angry, proud, smart and determined; it was completely without sentiment or cliche, and had a very realistic ending -- which is to say, it was totally unlike Where The Heart Is.

What really got me was my curiosity of what Novalee would do after being stranded in Oklahoma, pregnant, with only a skimpy dress and $5.55.  Living in the Wal-Mart is an interesting/unbelievable explanation, but it's a movie so I accepted it and moved on.  Novalee could have done anything/gone anywhere with her tree and $5.55, so why not stay in the Wal-Mart?  Anyhow, it gives her the 15 minutes of fame needed for the rest of the story.The rest of the movie was interesting as well just to see all these people living their lives.  Were some parts a little corny?  Yes, as if giving birth in a Wal-Mart was any attempt to do otherwise.  But the movie is very enjoyable and you'll find yourself just kind of watching the whole thing 'cause it's there.(kind of like British films, hehe -)But in the end, I think Novalee shows us that happiness is what we make of it.  There either is or isn't such a thing as destiny since she's dumped in some random town in Oklahoma(somewhere between Tennessee and California is all I knew at the time) and just begins to settle there and finds all she needs from this place.

Heartwarming, illuminating, even inspiring at times - but no tissues were required. It's more funny than moving.

Natalie Portman is Novalee Nation, a 17-year old with child. On the way to California with her revolting boyfriend, she is left in the car-park of a Wal-Mart store in a small town in Oklahoma. She has nothing except a foetus. The film tracks her life over the next five years the birth of her daughter Americus in the Wal-Mart; her budding photography career; her friendship with hospital nurse and serial mother Lexie Coop (Ashley Judd); her relationship with eccentric librarian (and the man who helped deliver the baby) Forney (James Frain). Novalee comes up against a few obstacles, but her will and determination are strong - perhaps too much so. I think the reason why WTHI isn't a weepie is that Novalee is too strong a character - the audience doesn't really feel for her, or doubt she will eventually triumph. Her biggest problem is her superstition over the number 5 bad things happen to her when it crops up. One the way to California she buys some shoes from Wal-Mart and the change from $10 is $5.55 - she rushes out to the carpark and sure enough the boyfriend is long gone. But despite this lukewarm aspect (and it's not due to bad acting from Portman - she is divine) there are many highlights to be seen here. One is the knockout performance by Ashley Judd - and a great supporting role from Wal-Mart. Novalee gives birth in aisle 6 (after scrambling out of aisle 5) in the Wal-Mart; she gets a job there; she gets married there. The Wal-Mart people would be well-satisfied with this film.

Portman has a unique look of innocence that cannot be pulled off by many actresses as she does with her character, Novalee Nation. I couldn't wait for the next scene she would be in because of the physical beauty she possesses and the beauty in the performance she gives.Complimenting the performance of Portman is that of Ashley Judd.

Ashley Judd lights up the screen every SINGLE time she arrives in a scene. It is a no wonder she is the best at what she does.Another reason I liked Where The Heart Is relates to the double storylines of Portman's character determined to raise her daughter by herself while trying to make a career in photography. The other storyline revolved around the ex-boyfriend trying to make a name for himself in country music. The cool thing is these are hobbies of mine and whenever I saw a camera or heard country music it brought a smile to my face.

As you watch Novalee Nation (Natallie Portman) transform from a vulnerable down on her luck and knocked up teenager to an elegant and wise young woman, you can't help get sucked into the story.  You laugh at her obsessive hate for the number 5 yet are amazed at the way bad things always happen involving fives.  You feel bad for Lizy (Ashley Judd) and her awful bad luck with men, not to mention her children who have snack foods as namesakes.  Yet you think of someone you know who always seems to attract the worst of the other sex.And you feel relieved (and yet sad) when you see the failed life of Novalee's boyfriend who dumped her at Wal-Mart.The only negatives are that the movie gets a bit slow in certain places and gets preachy at times.If you have ever been pregnant or lived with a pregnant woman, you will really be able to relate to a lot of the humor in this movie.  And if you have children, you will feel the full emotional impact of this filmI highly recommend this movie for almost everyone.  And guys, it's not a chick flick!

It makes you feel the inner depths of what makes up your personality.  Since tomorrow is composed of all your life experiences of todays and yesterdays, those of us that view life as a long journey of deep, strong feelings will be in emotional heaven through every character.  This movie also reminds you that life is composed of individual and very unique experiences, the significance of which we may not immediately understand, but which come into focus with the passage of time. If you have acted honorably, honestly and with respect for others, your actions age well.  Trust also an underlying theme of this movie.  It reminds you to find those special people in your life that you can trust with your deep emotions and to hang onto them forever at all cost. Invest in them by trusting them with your heart and they will invest in you with the same.  Both investments make you rich in life by becoming rich in emotions.  The most priceless thing in life is life itself and the relationships that a life full of robust feelings is built on.

Instead of male bashing, Where The Heart Is presents flawed men-- and flawed women, equally.  Instead of exalting the Sisterhood Of Women as some wonderful utopia, this movie reveals women leaning on men, men leaning on women, and the fractures within each group.For the first time in a long time (for Hollywood, at least) all of the actor's names above the titles are female. . .  but instead of a feminist movie, this is a humanist movie, celebrating the human condition above all.

Soon after, she gives birth, becomes a celebrity and her life really changes.I remember watching The Professional and commenting on the screen presence and maturity of Natalie Portman.  Years later she stole the spotlight in Beautiful Girls and I told my friend that she was destined to be a leading actress - too bad I didn't write it down.

The movie also boasts a strong supporting cast Ashley Judd, is wonderful as Novalee's perpetually pregnant friend who keeps choosing the wrong men and Stockard Channing and Joan Cusack also turn in strong performances.  Too bad I can't say the same for the writing.The writers tried to stuff too many elements into the plot and it shows.  First, the parallel plot involving the boyfriend who dumps Novalee may have been intended as a Karmic parable, but it is horribly contrived and a total waste of screen time.  Second, you always know ahead of time when something bad is going to happen because of the overuse of a certain omen.  Third, given the number of tragedies the women have to face you begin to feel like you're watching a soap opera.  Finally, the actors are forced to deliver some truly horrible lines (which they manage to do so with a straight face).Make it a matinee, or better yet, wait for the video.

Actually, the film is much more than a chick flick; it leads the audience to explore a plethora of colorful characters and situations that make us fall in love with a young woman named Novalee.  Having read the book, I found myself, while viewing the film, yearning for the clever commentary and added extras the book provided.  The film also moves a little too quickly, glossing over some important situations in Novalee's life.  However, the film does live up to expectations in my opinion, and executes the story well.Natalie Portman has always been a favorite of mine, ever since I first viewed her in The Professional.  She is the main reason for the film's charm and charisma.  The supporting actors are hilarious and portray their character's colorful personalities to a tee, the best of whom being Ashley Judd.  One of my favorite parts of the film however was the ending, which happens to be quite different from the book.  In the book, Novalee is at a telephone booth, telling Forney she loves him.  In the film, Novalee drives to Maine to be with him, and then they end up marrying at the Walmart.  I thought it was a cute and heartwarming way to close the picture.I definitely recommend the film to everyone.  While it's no American Beauty or Cider House Rules, it conveys a sort of feel-good aura that makes it a joy to experience.

It's the tale of Novalee Nation, a girl who was left at a Wal-Mart by her boyfriend on his way to California. At the time, she was seventeen... and pregnant. She stays in the Wal-Mart until she has her baby, and by doing so becomes a celebrity overnight. The story continues as we follow her life as she comes to care for and even love all the members of the small town she finds herself in. We also follow the story of her ex-boyfriend as he slums his way through life, eventually leading him right back to where he started. Novalee has every hardship imaginable thrown at her, and through it all she learns to live her life to the fullest and love to her fullest extent.Yes, it's a beautiful story from a novel that is one of my favorites. Unfortunately, this movie does not do it justice. One of the biggest problems for me was several points of severe under-dramatization. I wanted to feel more the entire time. I wanted more emotion and drama the entire time. Miss Portman does a decent job of portraying Novalee Nation, but she doesn't seem to get that into it. Perhaps it's because I'm a drama-lover, but I wanted more from her character in particular. The rest of the cast is all acceptable. The two guys of the story especially stood out to me Dylan Bruno and James Frain as the man who dumps her and the man who falls in love with her. Stockard Channing was also enchanting in the role of the woman who takes Novalee in, Sister Husband.Really it's a story about love. Once you have it, you must never let it go. Once you do, you'll never be content until you set it right. This wonderful story shows that. That's why it has the rating it does. It's hard to go too wrong with a tale like this. 6/10 stars!

Her newfound friendships with strong supportive females and one really sweet guy, become less friendship and more of a family for her, which includes her own daughter.

This is exactly what happened to me when I sat down to watch Where The Heart Is. Within the first few moments of the film, I knew it would be special; this reason is Natalie Portman. Portman has a unique look of innocence that cannot be pulled off by many actresses as she does with her character, Novalee Nation. I couldn't wait for the next scene she would be in because of the physical beauty she possesses and the beauty in the performance she gives.Complimenting the performance of Portman is that of Ashley Judd. As I was watching Judd and Portman, I could tell that these are two actresses who knew exactly what the other would say and do the moment before it was actually done. Ashley Judd lights up the screen every SINGLE time she arrives in a scene. It is a no wonder she is the best at what she does.Another reason I liked Where The Heart Is relates to the double story lines of Portman's character determined to raise her daughter by herself while trying to make a career in photography. The other storyline revolved around the ex-boyfriend trying to make a name for himself in country music.The story is one that will take you on a journey through the depths of your heart, soul, and end up in your head relaying the message that Where The Heart Is is a phenomenal movie.Where The Heart Is is not only my favorite film but the best film of 2000.

Every time she comes across anything that includes the number five, whether it's five o'clock or five dollars in change at the store, it is followed by some form of calamity that makes Novalee's life a little harder. Furthermore, Novalee experienced misfortune even with her own daughter.Where The Heart Is first began as a novel written by Billie Letts. Then, it was turned into a motion pictured directed by Matt Williams and screenplay by Lowell Ganz. My aunt who always recommended me to watch it gave this movie to me as a Christmas gift. I think she wanted me to know that there are many hardships in life and to never give up, just like Novalee kept on going with her life even though she had many discouraging events that happened to her. Where The Heart Is opened in 2000 but I first watched it on November 20, 2005 in my room at my house. This movie rated 6.5 on a scale from one to ten on the Internet Movie Database. It was given a low scored because many viewers believed the characters could have been more developed in their parts. I personally would rate this movie a ten because it was very dramatic to me and very compelling. It had really captured my attention with Novalee's character and all of her misfortunes adding on and on as she kept trying to find some hope.In Where The Heart Is, the number five an ironic symbol of bad luck, because in the movie Novalee faces more struggles in her already misfortunate life when she comes along anything with the number five tied with it. Even though she did all she could to keep her away from pain, it still hovered over her like a black cloud always around.Novalee's life of bad luck had begun at early childhood. On her fifth birthday her mother left her for a baseball umpire and never came back and left her to spend her growing up years alone with no family to rely on. From that moment on she was cursed with ill luck. After she dropped out of school to wait tables in a restaurant, a waitress that went crazy attacked Novalee with a steak knife and cut her from wrist to elbow. It took fifty-five to stitch her back up. From this traumatic experience in her life, Novalee continued her life constantly followed with pain and heartache when she comes across the number five.Novalee's persistent misfortune had followed her throughout her life every since she was a young girl. She left her trailer home with her controlling boyfriend to begin a new life in Tennessee at five o'clock. He had bought an old heap for eighty dollars with no floor on the passenger side. Novalee fell asleep and her shoes fell out from the bottom. After, they stopped at a Wal Mart so that she could use the bathroom and to buy some slippers. After purchasing her item the cashier gave her change of five dollars and fifty-five cents. Novalee was horrified and ran out of the store leaving her stuff behind. She nervously ran out into the parking lot and only found her old camera sitting in the parking spot where she last saw her boyfriend. For the next two weeks she managed to stay inside the Wal Mart at night and using merchandise that would help her get through her day and her pregnancy. At the same time she kept a list of the things used and how much she owed Wal Mart. Then one night while Novalee slept, she felt a sharp pain from her stomach. She nervously walked down the aisle gasping in pain when her water broke and she fell to the ground in aisle five. She helplessly crawled to aisle six and then a man broke through the window and delivered her baby while she had passed out. She woke up the next day in the hospital only to be surprised that she was a local celebrity. She was now considered the mommy that gave birth to the Wal Mart baby. She wanted to give her baby a strong name that means something. She named her Americus Nation.Furthermore, Novalee still continued to come across more struggles even with her own daughter. Americus was born on July 5, 1995. When Americus was five days old she got the jaundice, when she was five weeks old she had an ear infection, and when she was five months old she was kidnapped. A religious couple that believed she was an abomination kidnapped her. They had come from Midnight, Tennessee to give the word of God to the baby but were turned away by the Welcome Woman. They were the same couple that sent Novalee a letter and wrote, A baby born out of holy wedlock is an abomination in the eyes of God. After they kidnapped Americus, they had left her in a manger in a Nativity scene in front of a church.The number five is a symbol of the same main thing in the movie. One single number represents the pain and struggles of one person. Although, after all Novalee's heartaches it shows that everything turns out for the best and that with bad comes good.

The climax comes near the end, she looks him up at the university he attended after his sick sister died, tells him and he says 'Novalee there is nothing better than you.'  Not a great movie, but a nicely-told little romantic story. Natalie Portman is in fine form, as she was in movies like 'Beautiful Girls' and 'Leon.' Her only bad acting role was in Star Wars.

This seemed like it started out as a joke, but then the script-writer(s?) decided to throw in some drama, without actually trying to make a good balance between the two. I honestly can't say that Natalie won me over with her naive, barely likable teenage character, or her over-the-top fake southern accent. The plot seems to go nowhere, even though there's material for several long films, or quite a few TV series. The whole thing with the number 5 bringing bad luck; it just seemed like a very weak plot device, that could've been thought of by a child. The plot twists are barely enough to keep the story going, and are mostly just desperately trying to keep the viewers interest, usually unsuccessful. This is indeed a very average attempt at a drama; the only honestly positive thing I can say about it is that the humor does have its moments, just too few of them, and the actors mostly do good work. Most people should skip it, though.

As far as Portman's acting, I accepted her quietness as part of Novalee's character and the transformation from abandoned child to young mother was touching.

I'll get to that later, but first of all you should be advised that this film is an advertisement for a chain of large retail stores based in small towns across the U.S.  Subsequently, there's lots of emphasis on religion, specifically christianity.  If, like me, the site of people sitting around a table praying before a meal makes you uncomfortable, that's reason alone to avoid this film.  The Great Big Store/religion tie-in is as subtle as a wallop from a sledgehammer, as anyone who has ever been in the Great Big Store can attest from the choice of reading material in the book department.Natalie Portman, she of the annoying monotone from Star Wars Episode IV, plays a pregnant young woman who is abandoned by her boyfriend at the Great Big Store.  She lives in the GBS for six weeks, then has her baby.  A local crazy librarian with curly hair and gigantic brown eyes leaps through a plate glass window to deliver her baby.  How he was able to discern that she was having her baby when she was in the middle of the store, far from the entrance, is anyone's guess.  Hollywood knows nothing about plate glass windows; in real life, such a stunt results in many deep cuts, profuse bleeding, and stitches, though the hunky librarian emerges unscathed.Natalie becomes a celebrity because her baby was born in the GBS.  Seeing her on the news, her trashy mother, wonderfully played by Sally field, comes back and promises to set up a new home for her after abandoning her many years ago.  True to the movie's premise, mom never shows up for the promised ride to the new home.  Clearly, the person who wrote this film has some abandonment issues.Ashley Judd plays a new friend who pops up from nowhere as though they've known each other for years.  In fact, Stockard Channing does the same thing.  If this film teaches anything, it is that complete strangers are much more reliable than your own family.  Ashley doesn't believe in birth control, and she sleeps around like mad, so she has one baby after another, all from different men.  An earth mother, she blithely goes through life without a care in the world, not working, with no thought of how in the world she's going to care for the inevitable next baby when she has five of them already.  Her earth mother status is chopped short when she dates a man who goes after her daughter and she catches him in the act.  Why did she leave her children alone in the house?  Who was watching them?Stockard is killed by the phoniest looking tornado in Hollywood history, proving once again that nothing beats the sheer terror of the sixty-year-old tornado in The Wizard of Oz.  There is a moment of high drama when Natalie is being pulled into the tornado, but holds onto a stair-step with one hand.  Right.  A weather phenomenon that can destroy buildings, pick up cars, and snap trees in two is unable to dislodge the puny fingers of a young woman from a piece of wood.  Okaaaaaaay.In a seemingly unrelated subplot, Natalie's boyfriend becomes a country-western singer, managed by the incomparable Joan Cusack.  Unfortunately, she's only on the screen for a few minutes.  I wish that Joan and Natalie had changed places, then we'd have a real film.  Anyway, the cowboy singer inexplicably bottoms out and turns to a life of drink and drugs, wanders onto a railroad track, and gets his legs cut off.  Take that, you woman-hating, girlfriend-abandoning jerk, the female voice of the film seems to say.  Typical of scripts seemingly written by fourteen-year-old girls, the characters are either good or bad.  The librarian cares for his invalid sister for years, foregoing a promising future.  Stockard regularly sleeps with a man but they're not married, but it's okay because she's religious, you see.  Natalie herself can do no wrong, of course; there is not one moment in the film where she makes a mistake and has to make up for it.  When did this happen?  When did they start making movies about dull leading characters who are the object of all the evil in the world?  It's the everything happens to me phenomenon, where people feel that they don't have to take responsibility for their actions, and that it's someone else's fault.  It's symptomatic of the world today; just look at Gary Condit or those Enron guys.Anyway, the film wanders over the screen like a sleepy dog, never finding its center.  What is this film about?  Who knows?  Who cares?  I'm convinced that there is a group of fourteen-year-old girls somewhere who write these kinds of scripts (Boys On The Side, for example) and are simply replaced, Menudo-like, the next year after they mature too much.  On a scale of one to ten, I have to give this film a three.

Ashley Judd is very good, beautiful and engaging as well.  It's a charming fairy tale -- though one which in its broad outlines has a refreshingly plausible upside ending, rather than the incredible long shot sort.One bit of movie trivia -- I love the evocation of Natalie's first very powerful role, as the already charismatic and disturbingly sexy 12 year old informally adopted by a recent immigrant hit man in The Professional, through her huging to herself a large potted plant as she travels into a new home and phase of her life. In each film it's the only emotional tie the young girl really has left at that transition, before she builds up again from rubble.Where the Heart Is has a thoroughly laudable set of messages, and their general outline rings true.  It's all about openness and giving to others, ultimately prevailing over selfishness and irresponsibility. It's about finding the right people for you, even when they might not seem so right at first.  It's about young and not quite so young women learning through life's experiences to finally tell good men from not so good or downright bad men. Further, it's refreshingly set in a geographic and social part of the country, among Oklahoma and Tennesse small town working class whites, that generally gets little attention in the movies.  With captivating and charismatic performances by the beautiful Portman and Judd, and as well in a different way Stockard Channing as the reformed alcoholic earth mother, what's not to like?  It should be a thoroughly winning, if fairly small movie.  Well, partly it is.  Portman and Judd have done their careers no harm, and some good, by this film.  The screenplay, by and large, is good as well.  The trouble is the directing.In its its character portrayal details, this movie is fundamentally false.  How could a young girl as emotionally unclouded, clear and giving, with almost no consuming resentments, come from foster homes, no father, and the thoroughly irrepsonsible and emotionally unreliable and distant mother which Sally Fields portrays in an excellent cameo?   As well, Portman as directed (and maybe cast) just doesn't pull off being nearly illiterate and not so bright very well.  She is obviously highly intelligent in every look and expression she gives.  Judd as well plays too smart for her role.  They are both simply gems too unclouded to be believable in their life circumstance -- especially the older Judd, who has had more time to recover from teenage waywardness.  The result is something more like a fairy tale, than a work of real dramatic truth.  The fault seems the director's, not the actresses. They seem directed to have played unremittingly loveable, rather than real.Novalee would be much more believable if she were significantly wilder, more irresponsible and sexually driven than she is portrayed.  There is some tinge of that, in her early sexy innocence with her baby's father, and the very brief lust at first sight scene with the auto mechanic, but it is very much downplayed (no hot scenes, no compulsions), there is only one such relationship after she is abandoned, and it lasts barely a month.  Why if she wasn't going to keep being pulled in that direction doesn't she much sooner really connect with the young, intelligent and caring, and at least fairly good looking (if not cocky)  Forney -- who early on becomes the effective adoring daddy to the daughter which is the central focus of her life?  Instead it takes more than five years.  Yes, sure, the reasons given -- the spoken one that she doesn't think she's good enough for him, given his college and family background despite his unambiguous interest in her, and the unspoken one that he doesn't seem like enough of a stud to her until she has done some considerable changing and learning some of life's lessons -- together make perfect sense abstractly.  But they don't ring true emotionally in the film.  She seems like a Forney sort of girl in many ways from the get go, and certainly after she has given birth.  We see her learning and growing, but not emotionally or sexually changing all that much.  The fatal attraction for cocky studs just isn't portrayed, at least after she is abandoned in the Walmart parking lot right at the very beginning.Nor do we see what is supposed to be largely the same story actually portrayed by Judd -- rather than explained.  As well, what is with the never married Judd's pumping out the five kids by her early thirties?  The first one sure.  But then she doesn't wise up about female backup birth control?  I'm not saying that never happens.  I'm saying I don't buy that the character portrayed by Judd would have kept doing that, with her self awareness, intelligence and unclouded emotional makeup.  Unless perhaps there are things we aren't really told.  Such as that maybe the kids were really oops pregnancies designed to wring commitment out of a succession of guys that weren't really willing to marry her.  She tells Novalee and hence us that she repeatedly kids herself about the sorts of men she falls for, but it's something we hear about, rather than see in her. In each case the director didn't want to cloud the picture of emotionally perfect, and otherwise highly attractive, female characters slowly emerging from life's bad breaks and their small town working class origins.  They aren't complex or flawed enough to ring true, especially not with the life stories they present.

The movie would have you believe a kind librarian dove through a plate glass window at Wal Mart (where Novalee takes up residency after Mr. Wrong skips out...but for six weeks!!) in order to deliver her baby.

Ms. Portman continues her rise to the upper crust of Hollywood by making Novalee more than just the trailer trash her character could have easily fallen into, but by adding depth and feeling to an otherwise dull character.  Novalee could easily have been forgettable until the birth of the baby.Stockard Channing has a great turn as Sister Husband, the welcome woman of tiny Sequoyah, Oklahoma (I've been there, the movie wasnt filmed there...trust me.)

It was not a hard sell - we are both fans of Natalie Portman and Ashley Judd (perhaps me more so). I am no fan of Stockard Channing or Joan Cusack, but with two Oscar-nominated supporting actresses alongside Natalie and Ashley, I figured this really had to be all right. Right?We assumed it would be hokey. The Wal-Mart thing pointed accurately to the intended demographic. The ad for the soundtrack before the feature began was an ominous sign. But I could never have expected these four women to involve themselves in something like this. I stayed silent about how awful it was for a while, afraid of ruining the film for my wife, whom I feared might be enjoying it. But when the wind picked up through the window while Novalee was sorting the wedding pictures, I could not refrain from yelling twister!The tornado actually stood as a perfect metaphor for this movie - the dialogue was as subtle and manufactured as a Warner Brothers F4; the plot twists and turns as predictable as that studio tornado that creeps through miles of open country, but somehow is gonna wind up tearin' the house down and killing at least a dog. The only thing that surprised me was thatAmericus was not sucked out of the storm cellar. I was vindicated, however I had already predicted the Sister Husband woman was dead.I was unfortunately right again when I guessed that this was an Oprah Book Club pick. I admire Oprah, and my wife insisted it was too bad for her to select. But my hunch was that no writing this bad could have made it to the big screen without the Oprah propaganda machine. I find it sad that this touched so many people, because if I understand the message, it is this Women are victims. They will be dumped on and abused until some moment of dumb luck leads to an epiphany that will land them in the arms of the 'right' man.With a half hour left in the movie, we agreed that Forney was the only one holding up under the weight of this script. That was, until he started speaking more, and succumbed to the dialogue.I don't care for Wal-Mart and I do read the New Yorker, which clearly pegs me as a cultural elitist liberal snob. So be it. I had never anticipated coming here to post comments about a movie, but something about this movie made me connect to the Internet before the credits rolled. It was as bad as anything I have seen since `How to Make an American Quilt,' another movie I watched against better judgment to see an actress I like.I won't even mention Sally Field's scene.Ashley Judd and Natalie Portman are wonderful actresses.

Good performances and excellent individual scenes that occur so haphazardly that the movie never quite figures out where it is going but manages to cover a lot of ground in the process. This gives both films such a surreal quality that a few days after viewing you will wonder if the whole thing was just a dream (Christina Ricci as a blonde sorority girl-Natalie Portman as a pregnant hillbilly-must have just been my imagination). Unfortunately, both films stop short of being truly surreal and are simply ordinary efforts with a little strangeness. If a visionary director like David Lynch had just ratcheted up the surreal qualities a tiny bit more the result would have been special.The plot is such a mix of randomness, contrivance, flash-forwards, improbability, coincidence, reversals of fortune, and incidental sub-plots that the editor must have been pushed to the brink of madness during the post-production process. The ending is such a lame contrivance that you are puzzled that the producer did not send the script back for major alteration before shooting even began.It is a tribute to Natalie Portman that she holds this mess together, and even manages to keep the nausea meter at a tolerable level during the ending. Although you won't believe it from her Star Wars performances, Portman is really a fine actress. Although horribly miscast here (couldn't her character have been from rural Nebraska without that hillbilly accent), she does manage to bring her character to life.

This is exactly what happened to me when I sat down to watch Where The Heart Is.Within the first few moments of the film, I knew it would be special; this reason is Natalie Portman. Portman has a unique look of innocence that cannot be pulled off by many actresses as she does with her character, Novalee Nation. I couldn't wait for the next scene she would be in because of the physical beauty she possesses and the beauty in the performance she gives.Complimenting the performance of Portman is that of Ashley Judd. As I was watching Judd and Portman, I could tell that these are two actresses who knew exactly what the other would say and do the moment before it was actually done. Ashley Judd lights up the screen every SINGLE time she arrives in a scene. It is a no wonder she is the best at what she does.Another reason I liked Where The Heart Is relates to the double storylines of Portman's character determined to raise her daughter by herself while trying to make a career in photography. The other storyline revolved around the ex-boyfriend trying to make a name for himself in country music.The cool thing is that these are hobbies of mine and whenever I saw a camera or heard country music it brought a smile to my face. Not only are these hobbies of mine but they are both testaments to what can be done if one works hard enough to attain a specific goal. The story is one that will take you on a journey through the depths of your heart, soul, and end up in your head relaying the message that Where The Heart Is is a phenomenal movie.Where The Heart Is is not only my favorite film but the best film of 2000.

But it is a really good movie, nonetheless.  It is reminiscent of O'Connor in its wry, Southern feminity, its critique of the self-righteous, and its usage of suffering as a means to self-discovery and revelation. I also like its pro-life message. The women lack morals when it comes to sex outside of marriage, but at least they love their children and can separate the blessing of children from the less-than-perfect circumstances of the children's birth.  The title is a double reference to Home and to the beating heart of the unborn baby, referred to at the beginning by Novalee, to which the baby's father (before abandoning Novalee at Wal-Mart) says, You can't prove it to me.  His own encounter with the grotesque near the end of the film leads to his admission that this profession of doubt regarding the humanity of his unborn child was a lie. I don't remember if abortion is ever mentioned specifically in the movie, but it definitely presents a critique of the myth of choice, and the preeminent guilt of deadbeat dads for putting women in the circumstances where they feel it is necessary to kill their children rather than have them born into a life without a loving father.

However, if you like feel good movies this is a good one to see.This was a film with many subplots. Some have speculated that it contained too many subplots. I disagree. Peyton Place was successful, even a classic, and it contained just as many subplots. The movie is about realness. This isn't a film full of fluff typical of Hollywood. This is why it stands out to me. It's about life. Life is full of misfortune and unhappiness. From honesty and integrity to alcoholism and loss, this film has it all. It's not glossed over but touched on in a way that makes you see how life passes by and mistakes are made but you pull through in the end.One viewer pointed out how unrealistic the film was because of lack of surveillance in a Wal-Mart. Perhaps. However, not every small town has a need for such hi-tech systems. This doesn't mean it's realistic but it doesn't mean it's unrealistic either. It's simply a fact.The film has plenty of humor as well as tearful moments. Though I don't like Ashley Judd (that's putting it lightly), she did well in the film.

Even though the story takes place in Oklahoma, there was no fooling this former Austinite. The locales were very familiar and it was fun pointing out to friends my ol' stomp'n ground.Natalie Portman of Star Wars fame, was perfect as the pregnant, naive, somewhat dumb young girl, who gets abandoned by her boyfriend in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart. (Been to that Wal-Mart many times) and is befriended by an odd assortment of characters. Lexie played by Ashley Judd stands out. Judd is just down right gorgeous, and even in the scene where she has stitches and bruises, she's still beautiful. Her comedy touches really carry this film. The supporting cast was excellent. Still, Hollywood, has noticeable problems with southern accents and some of the supporting cast struggle with it, even some of the veteran ones, but Forney played by James Frain, a skilled British actor, playing an American was fun to watch.The events that fall into place throughout the story are entertaining but the sure luck of Novalee is a bit on the far-fetched side. Having her spend the rest of her life on welfare and turning tricks on the street corners, would have been more real to life, but a real cinematic bummerThe main theme is that despite the circumstances, people can still live out their dreams, and friends and family, even adopted ones, are so very valuable to life.This is one that can be enjoyed again and again.

I think Novalee showed a great example of someone who decided to take charge of her life, and made her dream of becoming a photographer and having a home come true.  It's pretty schmaltzy in places, and maybe a bit unbelievable in others.  But, who says a movie has to be believable?  I think if it entertains you, or moves you, or makes you think.....it's not like we don't know it's just a movie.

Ashley Judd and just about everyone else in this movie did a fine job.  Unfortunately, Natalie Portman, who did a fantastic job in Beautiful Girls, let the team down.  Her facial expressions rarely altered.  If the eyes are the window to the soul, hers were permanently shuttered, and her face was a stiff mask.  She was able to carry the comical parts quite well.  Perhaps she has not truly suffered, or, conversely, she has suffered too much, to be able to convey sorrow or abject loss.  The love scene, as well, was too, too romantic - not very realistic. The poor fellow did his best, but Natalie Portman did not convey a sense of undying love for poor Forney.  Also, I had no idea the setting was Oklahoma until the tornado hit.  I thought the setting was Texas.  I do like Ms. Portman's work, generally.  (Perhaps this character is the secretive type, who never gives her feelings away?)  I might read the book and check this out for myself.  My apologies if that is in fact the case.  I would give this movie a 6.5 out of ten.

None of the characters except Willy Jack and Moses Whitecotton were as I pictured them.  And it wasn't just the way I pictured them, it was the way they were described in the book.  Novalee was supposed to be thirty-seven pounds overweight according to the back of the book, not looking as though she has anorexia nervosa.  I couldn't put this book down while I was reading it, but I found myself checking the clock every five minutes during the movie to see when I would be put out of my misery.

It was.  However, it was a chick flick in both senses of the term.In the pejorative sense of chick flick, this movie is like a CD-changer with four CDs -- wacky, weepy. sappy, and sweet.  Moreover, the changer has not even been put on random play, so the order of play among the CDs is predictable when it is not formulaic.  Even fans of soap operas should grow tired of diseases and desertions, deaths and dopes. On the other hand, Natalie Portman realized her character well and her speech to Ashley Judd was superior to any formal philosophy I have read or heard.  Many elements of the picture amplify or exemplify the lesson that Portman there enunciates, so the film achieves coherence around the means that women use to get around the preponderance of lowlife males in the world.  That is the good side of a chick flick.I'd have cut out everything about Willie Jack after he leaves K-Mart.  He is largely a digression.  That would lose the film Joan Cusack's wonderful character but would shorten the film and keep it focused.I was pleased by Sally Field's cameo but angered by the credulity of the central character with respect to Momma Lil.  I found it hard to sympathize with Novalee, so stupid was her trusting her mother.  If the movie is about goodness, could we see goodness unalloyed by stupidity, naivete, or recklessness?I enjoyed the characters, was intrigued by the beginning, was not annoyed by the predictable ending, and wish that much of the middle had been streamlined.

I honestly expected this movie to be your typical chick-flick melodrama, and was expecting to be miserable as I sat next to my wife watching it. I was totally unprepared for how much I enjoyed this movie.  While I thought Natalie Portman did an adequate job as Novalee Nation, it was the performances of Ashley Judd as Lexie Coop and especially Stockard Channing (of whom I've never really been a fan) as Sister Husband that made this movie for me.  In some ways, the quirky characters in this movie reminded me of the characters in Mumford, although in that movie, too much emphasis was placed on their quirkiness, whereas in Where the Heart Is, the characters felt more like real people. Joan Cusack and Sally Field have relatively minor roles, but still carry off their characters well.  James Frain is great as Forney Hall, the genius caretaker of the library who falls for Novalee.  A great script that never really falls into melodrama, and which features a few unexpected turns.

Using a skillful combination of good acting, plot development, and an appropriate amount of emotional manipulation, director Matt Williams successfully guides us along Novalee Nation's (Natalie Portman) seemingly random, unexpected, and thought-provoking life.  Portman demonstrates great potential as a serious, mature actress as the young, abandoned, single mother protagonist. Although Portman's relative youthfulness and inexperience surfaces at times, it aptly suits her character's young age.Portman is surrounded by an excellent supporting cast.  Lexie Coop (Ashley Judd) provides an incredible mixture of sass, sensuality, and seriousness at all the right times.  Likewise, Stockard Channing somehow remains alone in her own world as Sister Husband, as if serving some sort of higher purpose. Even Sally Field's appearance contributes more to the movie than its briefness would suggest.Although the women in this movie make it shine, the men provide substance. Dylan Bruno's performance as the insensitive, selfish, womanizing Willy Jack Pickens exceeded my expectations.  It would have been too easy to end up hating this man. However, Bruno manages to break out of the trite Hollywood stereotype and emerges as something larger.James Frain does a commendable job as Forney Hall, the town's eclectic librarian.  He manages to blend comfortably with the rest of the ensemble, never overplaying nor underplaying this role.  Frain helps keep the movie centered on Novalee's life, not his.If I sound impressed by the acting, I am!  If someone forced me to pick a flaw in the movie, I could only point to the ending.  Or, to be precise, how the movie wraps itself up so neatly at the end. With such strong acting, Where the Heart Is could have taken a chance and ended on a slightly bittersweet tone.  How poignant would that have been?  Unfortunately, Williams opted for the fairytale ending, leaving me with a faint saccharine aftertaste.

It's more about the everyday life of a young woman and the impact she has on those around her. Novalee Nation (Natalie Portman) is a young woman, pregnant with child, who has aspirations of living the American Dream with her less than ideal boyfriend. As is given away by the trailers, Nation's boyfriend abandons her at a Wal-Mart and Nation is forced to fend for herself and unborn child. She does the only logical thing. She lives in the Wal-Mart and eventually gives birth to her baby there. That's about the only true plot. From that point on, the story takes on a day in the life approach as the audience is given a glimpse of the people that go out of their way to help this young lady raise her child and guide her through life.What I really liked about this movie was that it was simple. There wasn't a complicated story or an abundance of special effects to distract you from the story. It was clean and simple with a genuine feel of humor laced throughout. You couldn't help but laugh. Natalie Portman was pretty good as Nation. She showed that she has a larger range than what was shown in The Phantom Menace but she still looks a little stiff in some scenes. Ashley Judd was very good as well but the real scene-stealer was Stockard Channing.

Portman grows up and into a career, the dependency roles get reversed with Judd, the older and hopelessly fertile woman who befriends Portman early on. There is a short, funny bit with Stockard Channing and her man-friend, thanking God for their bounty and asking forgiveness for having relations on the kitchen table this morning. All in all, you've got a movie that will come to television (read free) 90% or more intact on Lifetime or We, where the gals can snuggle up with their flannel jammies on the couch and munch popcorn.Maybe that's why so much of Where the Heart Is is drooling away from me. I'm not one of the gals, I don't have flannel jammies, and the damned popcorn kernel thingies always get wedged between my gums and back molars.

The characteristics (or rather symptoms) of this sort of garbage wasteful use of established, ultra talented cast (Natalie Portman, Ashley Judd, Sally Fields cameo) put to work with a horrible script (adapted from the novel by Billie Letts) that avoids building on interesting themes (Novalee Nation's development as a mother, which would have been a twist in respect to Natalie Portman's last movie, in which she plays a daughter), instead relying on the typical silly coincidences and cliches that will draw the chick flick and date movie crowd.The plot spans the some-odd 5-8 years in the life of a underprivileged young woman who steps out into the world with nothing more than a Polaroid camera and a baby and ends up with financial security, a perfect marriage, and a close friend in Lexie Coop.  The film seems to try to go for the witty Mark Twain humor and satire but the result is rather bland as the material seems rather uninspired to give an effect of slick, sugary, pretentious fairy tale that countless other movies before have offered.  Beyond the exciting climax of Novalee taking shelter and having her baby in a large department store, the story seems to lead nowhere, with numerous cartoonish developments that seem to initiate from anything in relation to the number 5.As an actress, Natalie Portman is a fine jewel that only the most talented director can shape into something of merit.  The absence of such a presence is disheartening, considering her early work was so superb.  Since The Professional made her one of my favorite actresses, it strikes a nerve to see her repeatedly shaped into a casual, nameless starlet who's essence is lost amongst the others like a grain of salt lost in the sand.Ok, enough rant.

BIG mistake.  this film was ridiculously written, poorly acted, just an enormous mess.  the plot of this film is so contrived, i wondered what the poor author, Billie Letts, thought of when seeing what hollywood has done to her novel, which i have not (and, as of now, will not) read.  we follow as one bad thing after another happens to these characters, and each are resolved so quickly it's like oh, well i'm glad that's over with. what's next after our brief moment of happiness?  the dialogue was bad and the script teases us with characters we are only given the potential to care about, and end up hating mostly.Natalie Portman's character is not as likeable as she seems, Ashley Judd's character is saved by her performance from being the biggest insult to women on earth, James Frain is SO close to being the best thing about the movie, but the script and direction kill that as well, Cusack's appearance in the movie is pointless and boring.  and Channing's character was fun to watch because she is luminous and the best performer in the movie, but even she was poorly written.  and Dylan Bruno as the no-good boyfriend...i wonder each minute he's onscreen WHY we are forced to follow his uninteresting jump in and out of country music fame.besides all of this, the characters are all immoral and unintelligent.  poor Keith David, a talented actor, was fortunate to be the token black wise man, but the rest... here's the message i got watching this movie  men are all jerks, women are imbeciles, and children are a burden on their poor parents who are forced to love them because hey..they're kids.  i was insulted.  i felt like getting up and screaming congratulations to the filmmakers! you have officially made me sorry that i'm a human being!you know what, i do recommend this movie.  i think every one should see it, i think film class students should be strapped to their seats to watch it in class as a study of what kind of films not to make, or at least to keep the heck away from.  i am sorry to say all of this, i like the actors, but truly this film was just terrible.  obviously it had a big budget, and the performers were well paid.  we'll pretend that's their excuse, because it's a career low for all involved.

Actually, I almost loved it, but only because, with just a little bit more work, this could have been as funny as any of the Naked Gun spoofs.Virtually every scene is so contrived, and the scenes so populated by actors intent on parodying their every move, that I had to stifle laughs throughout the movie. The most obvious example is the tornado sequence where our heroine grips the rungs of a ladder in a storm shelter while being sucked upside down by a twister that is hovering just overhead. Various objects blow past her including, finally, her baby girl, whom she manages to grab with a free hand, just in time. The person trying to hold on to her, just two rungs below, is somehow immune to the forces of nature trying to extract everything else from the cave. All the director would have had to do was add a few extra objects to the mess flying by, say a small dog that looked like Toto, or a re-creation of Judy Garland in red slippers, and the scene would have been perfect. But no, they tried to play it straight and all we are left with is an unbelievable series of set-pieces that increasingly strain credulity, until the final moment, when our southern heroine suddenly drives across the entire country to find true love with her jilted lover up in Yankee Maine.The only reason I gave this two stars and not one, is the great character acting by this ensemble. They are all wild eccentrics of one sort or another, and any one of them would have been a wonderful, tasty addition to a normal serious film.

It's a right-brain/left-brain thing that you just can't escape. Watch Harrison Ford when the demands of the art are greater than trivial. And watch it here with MIT grad Dylan Bruno where the demands of the part are barely trivial.

Like practically every chick-flick I've seen, Where The Heart Is has more than its share of downs, with a few ups here and there so the whole thing isn't a complete downer.  I would barely consider this a comedy; the only comedy came from Stockard Channing's character.  Instead, I got another bizarre, sad experience, ala Varsity Blues.The movie starts out with a young girl (no age is given) called Novalee, who is moving out to California with her soon-to-be deadbeat boyfriend.  He leaves her at a Wal-Mart store, where she manages to keep her cool and live in the store for almost two months undetected.  She meets an odd assortment of locals who help her get back on her feet again after giving birth to the Wal-Mart baby.Okay, now for the rant-there are small spoilers within.  The worst thing to happen with this movie is the glaring Wal-Mart all over it.  It made me laugh every time I saw the store, thinking how giddy everyone at Wal-Mart HQ must get when they see it.  It's product placement at its worst.  That encouraged me to look for more advertising Kodak, Pringles chips, Oreos, was it?  Second worst thing of the movie are the Southern stereotypes that are being drilled into my brain, very painfully.  I'm not a Southerner, but I don't believe everyone down there are like the characters in this movie.  I hated Ashley Judd's character the most.  She was flighty, annoyingly immature, and totally irresponsible with men and birth control...plus, she gave her children godawful names.  She made Natalie's Novalee look like a college grad.  Sally Fields gave a perfect whip the remote at the TV screen performance as the horrible, scheming mom to Novalee. Another big problem I had with this movie is that its time-span of five years ruins alot of the emotional impact.  The exact same thing happens in Ms. Portman's other film, Anywhere But Here.  We, the viewers, are dragged through five years of these characters' lives and have to endure every traumatic event within that time.  It's trauma overload, and way too much for me to handle.  Not that I get sad, it actually angers me to know that film-makers are doing whatever they can to get tears out of the eyes of viewers.  Call me stubborn, but I don't give them the satisfaction.  The only really happy event in the film is at the end, and it's so extremely short, that you might miss it if you blink.  In the end, I was pretty unsatisfied.Lastly, I absolutely hated Novalee's ex-boyfriend and the fact that precious minutes were wasted on his dead-end storyline.  Once he leaves Novalee, we get follow his life and watch him get his five minutes of fame and then witness his decline.  It serves no purpose whatsoever.  I couldn't have cared less what that sleazebag was up to.  It only came in handy during the short hospital scene near the end and even that wasn't worth the effort. To end on a brighter note, I thought Natalie Portman was very good and I really think these types of movies suit her talents, much better than Star Wars films.  Stockard Channing was quite good also, as was Sally Fields.  I know this movie is based on a novel, but I really wished they had used a generic department store in the film.  I wish the nice ending had been longer, too.  After all that depressing junk, I needed to see more than that.  Instead, I was reaching for my can of Pringles (coincidentally) for comfort.

The two-hour runtime really begins to drag.Plus points? The direction cannot be faulted and is successful in bringing across the atmosphere of this warm but desolate place. Ashley Judd's talents are wasted as Novalee's friend and confidante, and Stockard Channing is criminally underused as the woman who invites Novalee into her home - possibly the only character depicted with more than just a single dimension to them.Portman holds the film up, her looks and style as impressive as ever and almost making a likable character out of somebody who is so fundamentally self-centred. Unfortunately her attributes alone are not enough to save this poor example of a 'chick-flick' from its inevitable resting place sleepover parties for pre-pubescent girls.If you're over the age of twelve or have a Y chromosome in your body, avoid.

On their way to California from Tennessee, single and pregnant Novalee Nation (Portman) is abandoned by her boyfriend Willy Jack (Dylan Bruno) at a Wal Mart in Oklahoma.  She has no friends, no family and only a few dollars in her pocket.  Lost, with no one to turn to and no place to go, she takes up residence in the Wal Mart for the next six weeks, where destiny has placed her for the birth of her daughter.  Mercifully, fate brings Forney Hall (James Frain) to her, a young man who lives nearby above the town library with his sister, and he delivers the baby. 	What follows is a story of very real people who are just trying to live their lives as best they can, seeking the good in themselves as well as others, and striving to hold on to the important things as they sort and sift through all the obstacles life has to throw at them, and does.  Throughout her travails, Novalee's life is touched by those in need themselves, beginning with Lexie Coop (Judd), the nurse who befriends her when she needs it most, and `Sister' Husband (wonderfully played by Stockard Channing), who takes her in when she and her newborn baby have nowhere else to go. 	From the novel by Billie Letts, Williams and writers Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel have presented a truly heartwarming film, told through characters with whom the audience can readily identify and empathize; a story of compassion and love that aptly illustrates the magnanimity of the human spirit, as well as the depths of evil to which it is capable of descending.  When Novalee is in the hospital, her mother, Lil, (an uncharacteristic role for Sally Field in a terrific cameo), who had abandoned her when she was five years old, shows up after seeing the story of the `Wal Mart Baby' on television, only to steal from her.  In another exacting scene, Lexie tells Novalee of coming home from work early and catching her boyfriend abusing two of her children, a scene which is all the more effective because the crime is not shown; we see only Lexie and her children as she describes what happened.  And it is harrowing. 	Their work here firmly establishes Portman and Judd as two of the finest young actresses in film today; Channing has never been better, while Frain and Bruno must be given credit for adding so much to this worthy endeavor, as well as the rest of the supporting cast which includes Joan Cusack (Ruth Meyers), Keith David (Moses) and Richard Jones (Mr. Sprock).  A great story and first-rate performances all around make `Where The Heart Is' an unforgettable film that will stay with you, in your heart and in your soul, for a long, long time.  I rate this one 10/10.

"},{"Title":"This Movie hates you.","Date":"11 July 2011","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" his movie is shoddy. It took a decent premise and distorted it into a misguided, oversimplified yet somehow horribly contrite and contrived outing that should be left to the bargain bin. The warning signs appear early, as we find Portman's character knocked up by her AGGRESSIVELY distasteful beau, who couldn't be more stereotypical white trash if he wore confederate flag underwear. The audience is clearly supposed to dislike the guy, but the amazing part is how much this movie dislikes him and prevents him from any sort of happiness at every turn. Oh, but it actively dislikes all the other characters as well, and it TRULY despises the audience. Let it be quite clear Novalee Nation is a Saint. Everyone she meets immediately loves her (not counting her immediate family), she effortlessly balances her job and raising her child with pursuing her love life, and to top it all off, she looks like Natalie Portman without any effort. IN SPITE OF THIS, life hits Novalee and those around her with tragedy after tragedy for no apparent reason other than to bring some life to this limp, monotonous film. Not that any of these tragedies have any IMPACT on Novalee, OH NO. She is a plucky go-getter (who doesn't real go-get anything) who just plows on and lives her puny little life as if we're supposed to care. The most laughable example of the moronic melodrama she's put through is the tornado scene, which is drawn out far too long and features the worst CGI tornado in recent memory. The 'disaster' serves no real purpose other than to give one character an off-screen death and show off Novalee's impressive upper arm strength. I don't really blame Portman for any of this, I blame the insipid writing, amateurish directing and horrendous editing. As this film approaches the two hour mark (an hour and a half too long, if you ask me), it hits a cacophony of barely related scenes that never congeal to form a coherent picture. Portman is just stuck in this perfect storm of agony and makes due. The only inspiration evident in this film is the beginning, where Novalee is stranded at a Wal-Mart by her baby's daddy (can you GET more classy?), and must scavenge for supplies in the untamed aisles of the store. Its a fun for a little while, but it all comes crashing to a halt with the delivery of her child, AMERICUS Nation. Why this name was chosen never becomes clear, as it has no significance to anything or anyone beyond inducing a snicker every time its used on screen. Far from an inspiring tale of survival and recovery, Novalee is shown essentially riding on everyone else's coattails and somehow profiting from disaster. These disasters include Americus being kidnapped by religious fundamentalists for some reason (she turns up fine within minutes), Novalee's best friend beaten, and her daughter raped (both recover just fine, and the friend ends up marrying a guy later on), and her pseudo-boyfriend's sister's death, which is arguably an good thing and somehow ends up in a romantic tryst in a motel room. Sprinkled amid this tragedy salad are stale croûtons depicting the scuzzy impregnator who abandoned Novalee as he raises to meteoric heights as a country music singer (which isn't saying much) only to crash down again for no apparent reason. The ending to his (unnecessary) saga must be seen to be believed. His legs are cut off by a train and he ends up in a hospital where Novalee shows up and forgives him, then he's never heard from again. THERE, I saved you the pain of seeing it for yourself. Aside from being ridiculous, none of this has ANY bearing on the story other than to have somebody ELSE to dump tragedy upon.Ugh, I could mention the laughably stilted romance between Novalee and and James Frain, which spends most of the movie going NOWHERE and when it finally gets where it was going, you wish it would go back where it came from. All the side characters are either despicable pricks or angelic saints, and the only way to tell them apart are whether they are nice to Novalee or not. None of these characters are deep, they have no background, no purpose, and most of them aren't likable. It is bad, VERY bad when you're laughing at the pain a character is experiencing.I really could go on, but I can hardly bear the strain. This movie has no moral, no direction, no purpose to the goings on. It has bright patches but they are so few and far between its like they don't exist at all. Characters come and go and the whole film is literally DROWNING in melodrama. If you like Natalie Portman, you MIGHT be able to bear this cross with a straight face, but I'm pretty sure viewing this movie is considered cruel and unusual punishment.Out of respect for yourself, your loved ones, and for decent movies everywhere, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE.

There is no story, or better yet, the story is so messed up that I don't think even the (very good) actors know exactly what is happening half the time. I haven't read the novel, but I imagine it is much, much better. I believe the writer and director lost it somewhere along the way while transposing the novel into a screenplay.Oh, and how they lost it! This story doesn't have a beginning or an end, and in the meantime doesn't seem to be going anywhere for a full 2 hours! I caught myself waiting for the film to start after a full 90 minutes of watching it... The main characters seamlessly meander through the screenplay with no apparent direction; things seem to happen for no apparent reason (for example, the ex-boyfriend all of a sudden being run over by a train, then visited by the heroine in the hospital, and after that disappearing back into the woodwork again...). What's the point? We never manage to understand what the filmmakers are up to. Maybe it is our fault though...I read that this is the first movie of director Matt Williams. I sincerely hope it will also be the last.

Any one of the stories would fill a 120 minute film on its own, but Where the Heart Is, directed by Matt Williams and based on the novel by Billie Letts, starts out as a distraught little Tennessee tale and ends with everything but the kitchen sink. If a movie contains this much material, we know one of two things 1) The filmmakers have lots of ideas and think they need to cram all of them into it, or 2) poor editing. My guess it that Where the Heart Is suffers from both of those factors. 	Natalie Portman plays Novalee Nation, pregnant, broke, young, and recently dumped by her white trash boyfriend, Willy Jack Pickens (Dylan Bruno). She finds with nowhere to stay but the vary Walmart where she was left. Novalee meets Moses (Keith David), a friendly photographer, Sister Husband (Stockard Channing) and her husband, Mr. Sprock (Richard Jones), who offer a loving home to her after becoming aware of her situation, a hospital nurse (Ashley Judd) who goes through men like blue jeans, and Forney Hull (James Frain), a young librarian who soon finds himself falling in love with Novalee.	Meanwhile, in the film's most interesting subplot, Willy heads down the road to music success with a sarcastic, rude agent named Ruth Meyers, played with the perfect biting tang by Joan Cusack. Several of the scenes these two characters share are hilarious. Take this dialogue for instance Ruth You just carry that guitar around to keep your balance? Willy You want me to play? Ruth What the **** do you think I want you to do, call bingo? One tune; your best shot. Willy Well, I wrote this one myself. Ruth I have goosebumps already. But why focus on Novalee's boyfriend in the first place; it confuses the narrative. It gives the movie a different feel, and certainly adds some life into the otherwise boring mess, but this subplot is enough for a movie on its own. 	Where the Heart Is never really allows us to become familiar with any of the characters. The movie is better at stereotyping than developing. We see that Willy is lowlife through examples that a white trash lowlife might bestow, but never really get to know him. Novalee herself is too passive for us to really care about. Things happen to her, but she never really makes things happen. It is like she is a confused character bewildered in a series of events that turn her life from bad to worse. She is not very smart, either. Actually Where he Heart Is is one depressing situation after another. There is even a scene in which a tornado strikes town and kills one of the movie's most important characters. This is way too obvious, and, although the turn of events is necessary for the script, the method of bringing the events forth is completely ridiculous.	Are we really supposed to believe Novalee bunks inside a local Walmart for over six weeks? Doesn't the store have surveillance cameras or security guards or something. To show us Novalee is an honest person, the movie even has her keep a running tally of how much money she owes the store or food, clothing, and other essentials she uses. And what is it with the number five? Bad luck? How about bad screewriting, credited to Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel. 	We keep waiting for Where the Heart Is to take off and to be about something-but that never happens. The move never takes off and soars with its material. Here we have a movie with enough plot for a series, and with enough characters for several movies, but it never takes advantage of anything. It just kind of sits back and invites us to participate in the characters stupid decisions. Well, thanks for the invitation but I think I'll pass on this one&#133;  "}]
