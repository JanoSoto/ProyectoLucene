This production is too modern.  Now I understand that they probably wanted to make it more appealing to today's moviegoers, and I know that it's hard to fit all a book into a film - but why did they change the essence of who Fanny Price is?  She is a highly moral, quiet, smart, very put-upon young lady.  While Frances O'Connor is a wonderful actress, she played Fanny all wrong.  She was smiling (constantly), having pillow fights, speaking her mind.  There was no sense of period or restraint in her portrayal.  I think the writer/director should have had more faith in the characters in the book.With so many storylines to choose from in the book, I wonder why new ones were added, such as the slave trade and opium use?  It is a shame that Sir Thomas didn't have the character arc seen in the book, that has him appreciate Fanny more and show her greater kindness when he returns from Antigua.  In the film he is just always a big, mean bully.  Jonny Lee Miller's Edmund is not nearly pious and conflicted enough.  He is meant to be joining the clergy.I am sure I would have thought it was an average film if I didn't know the original source, but it was a big disappointment.

Every director can bring his or her fresh eyes to a play and make it new. Even so, I think we are obliged to stay true to the basic tennents of the text. Are the works of Jane Austen as open to interpretation? Maybe, but I doubt it; Certainly not if MANSFIELD PARK is anything to go by.MANSFIELD was always my favourite of Austen's six novels. Many modern critics, while not denying its basic greatness, have problems with the book. Many find FANNY PRICE unlikeable, many find her judgemental, and feel that her Stoic, Augustan approach is hard to relate to. Stand-by, do nothing, and eventually he'll see the error of his ways and come to love you. Not very modern, is it?OK, so if you don't like the main character, if you don't like what she has to say, then what do you do? Look for other aspects of the story you can relate to. In recent years some critics have chosen to see MANSFIELD PARK in Post-Imperial terms, as a critique of Slavery. After all, the family's wealth is based on plantations in Antiga, which were run by slaves. Is that what the book's about? Is it? I don't know. I think the evidence is a little slim, but who am I to deny the possibility? Maybe it plays a part in the subtext of the novel.So, I'm a modern script-writer who doesn't like the novel, it's pre-occupations or even Fanny Price. What do I do? I completely re-write the story to take a possible minor sub-text (slavery) and turn it in to the driving narrative force. I then take smart as a whippet, stubborn yet passive Fanny and turn her into a ballsy version of Bridget Jones. With an attitude. I then string together a couple of scenes from the book with a few invented bridging scenes to advance the romance. Et Voila! I have a completely different story!I don't know what this film is, but it isn't Mansfield Park. Enjoy it on its own terms, but don't ever get the idea that your watching Austen on the screen. But, jeeze. I think that if you're going to adapt a novel for the screen, you ought to at least like the source material; Otherwise, what's the point? If you don't like the main character, you shouldn't be able to completely re-invent her. Or if you do, you should have the decency to be a little ashamed.

It's quite watchable. Some of the acting, especially from Pinter is excellent.But the rest resembles those films made from classic novels in the 30s where no one concerned in making it had time to read the book. A quick treatment by a college student, a quick script conference, then off we go. Rozema has almost no idea of what the book is about but is entirely unembarrassed by her ignorance in her interview on the DVD.Austen fans don't have to wait long to discover just how far off the wavelength she is. The first contact between Sir Thomas and Fanny is a reproof for running through MP's corridors shrieking like a banshee. Lines are taken from Mary Crawford in the book and given to Fanny in the film. How's that for missing the point? One by one characters appear looking no more recognisable than if they were appearing in a literary celebrity edition of Scooby Doo.I agree with other reviewers that if the film was called something else and the characters had different names, it would be impossible to trace it's origins to Austen's book which is definitely not a conventional love story about bright young things getting together having overcome a few obstacles.There's very little to choose between the morals of Rozema's characters, so nothing of the catastrophic descent into the abyss is associated with the production of Lover's Vows, nor do we have any glimpse of Rushworth and Crawford vandalising Sotherton. Mrs Norris is one of the most deliciously evil creations in literature - Rozema reduces her part to a few lines. Thomas Betram is a modern artist - yikes! William Price, Fanny's brother and one of the key relationships in the book, is missing altogether. Susan, her sister, has been reading too many Style magazines.Mansfield Park might have been a bit like this had it been written by Georgette Heyer or even Jackie Collins. As an Austen adaptation it is execrable. But it's so far off the mark, that as something else entirely, it's not all that bad. Maybe they should just change the title.

I am not a Jane Austen purist - if I were, I could not say that the Root/Hinds version of Persuasion was my favorite Austen adaptation, which it is.  This is Patricia Rozema's Mansfield Park, NOT Jane Austen's.First, Rozema gives us a feisty, spirited Fanny Price, who tells off Aunt Norris and Sir Thomas, who accepts Henry Crawford's proposal, and then rejects it the next day (a la JA herself with Harris Bigg-Wither). In this MP, Sir Thomas deserves to be told off. He is portrayed as a lecherous dirty old man, who leers at Fanny and Mary Crawford throughout the film.We have all heard about the additions Rozema made to the film. She deals with the slavery issue in a very heavy-handed way, beating us over the head with it whenever possible. Tom Bertram is not the empty-headed fop he is in JA's book; here he is just as much an abolitionist as Fanny, and it is his sketchbook filled with incriminating drawings of Sir Thomas abusing the slaves in Antigua that Fanny finds. In fact, Rozema's take on Tom is rather bizarre; in the book, his arguments with his father center around his irresponsibility and his profligacy. In the film, while Sir Thomas tries to scold his son for these faults, Tom takes him to task for his activities in Antigua. What I found odd was that, if Tom is such an abolitionist, why would he be so free and easy with money tainted by the slave trade?Rozema left out what I consider to be some very important people and scenes. William Price and the Grants are nowhere to be seen; as a result, there is no amber cross bought with prize money, no distress over which chain to wear to the ball, no one to accompany Fanny to Portsmouth. Fanny's dislike and distrust of Henry are never fully explained. We never get to see the outing to Sotherton and, while we do see Maria flirting relentlessly with Henry, we never see him playing one sister off against the other. Fanny's disapproval of the theatricals is never explained either. In Rozema's version, it seemed as if Fanny was simply not invited to be in the play, instead of being unalterably opposed to it. The scene with Fanny playing Anhalt to help Mary Crawford rehearse is also completely wrong. Mary starts caressing Fanny, while Edmund watches with his eyes almost popping out of his head. So, instead of Edmund giving in and joining the play in order to spare his family the embarrassment of publicity, we are left with the impression that he takes on the role of Anhalt just so that he can justify having Mary run her hands all over him.Next, we have the scenes at Portsmouth. Here, we have Henry sending Fanny a display of fireworks and doves, and then we see her accepting his proposal and sealing the bargain with some less-than-chaste kisses - in public, no less! The  (in)famous sex scene between Maria and Henry takes place at Mansfield Park rather than in London and, because Rozema has played with JA's chronology of events, Fanny is already back from Portsmouth, and it is she who catches them in the act. Edmund is present for the aftermath, where Maria tries to defend her actions.Another thing that galled me no end is that Mary Crawford's defense of her brother's actions is done in person, at Mansfield Park. She is patronizing towards all concerned, including Sir Thomas, who has finally stopped leering by this point. The newspaper item announcing Maria and Henry's behavior to the world is read by Fanny, and the culprits' full names are used, which is also not the way it happened in the book.A couple of people walked out about 1/3 of the way through the screening I attended, and several others walked out just as the credits began.  The Wishbone versions of Pride & Prejudice and Northanger Abbey resemble the source material more than this trash does.  Shame on you Ms. Rozema, shame on you!

The acting is fairly good - particularly Johnny Lee Miller, who makes an excellent Edmund. But the story is not that of Jane Austen's wonderful novel. The Fanny Price of the novel is a delicate wallflower, intelligent and warm but extremely timid. In the film, she's feisty and strong-willed, independent and almost rebellious. Fanny Price is not confident and witty; she is shy and thoughtful. This new Fanny may fit modern sensibilities, but I was severely disappointed; by completely altering the main character, the whole story seems different. I should very much like to see an adaptation of the novel that remains as faithful to the book as the BBC's excellent mini-series version of Pride and Prejudice (the Colin Firth / Jennifer Ehle version) or Emma (with Kate Beckinsale, not the Gwynneth Paltrow version). If you want a romantic movie, go for it. But if you're an Austen fan, you might want to stay clear.

Having immensely enjoyed recent renderings of Sense and Sensibility, Emma, and various versions of Pride and Prejudice, I expected to receive similar enjoyment from this film.  I had not read any reviews or advance press before watching it.  I had, unfortunately, just read the book itself this summer and it was fresh in my mind.  In my opinion this is the WORST rendition of a Jane Austen work I have ever seen.  Perhaps if I had never read the book, I might have enjoyed it somewhat more, but to me it was unbearable to see a book I thoroughly enjoyed so completely rewritten.  I am astonished at the comments of some of the reviewers here opining that Jane Austen would have approved. Poppycock!I began to feel sick early on.  To me, the character of Fanny Price and other major characters bore as much resemblance to Jane Austen's heroine as Danny Devito bore to Arnold Schwarzenegger in Twins. The entire invention of Fanny as a budding writer, the deletion of her younger brother who was so important in the plot concerning Henry Crawford, the image of Fanny as somewhat outspoken and rebellious, the depiction of Fanny's aunt as an opium addict and her uncle as a brutish, raping slaveowner.... The list goes on and on.  Henry and Maria being caught by Fanny in the house, Fanny voluntarily kissing Henry and agreeing to marry him and then retracting.  Ugh!I really detest writers who want to mold everything in the modern vein. Fanny Price was not a modern heroine, but she fit her time.  There was far too much PC propaganda and feminist hogwash which you might expect in a movie about our society but is ridiculous set against Fanny's time. She was devout, loyal, quiet, humble, stubborn only in her keen perception of others' character as measured against her conviction of what was good and what was not, possessing an innate strength of character which did not rely on others' perception of her and which she refused to compromise.  Jane Austen would not have approved of this new Fanny for precisely this reason  her Fanny did not care about the new conventions of moral thought and permissiveness in her own society.  The movie downplayed the seriously flawed characters of Henry Crawford and his sister.  It portrayed him far too sympathetically, made it appear that he truly and deeply loved Fanny and seemed to blame Fanny's (non-existent) double-mindedness for his downfall.All in all, this is an extremely disappointing film if one cares about what was really written in Mansfield Park.  I think Clueless as a modern version of Emma (and which I also enjoyed) is more true to Austen than this let-down of a movie.

Not having read it, I can't comment on that, but whereas I enjoyed  Douglas McGrath's 'Emma' and Ang Lee's 'Sense and Sensibility' (both praised as faithful to their texts), 'Mansfield Park' is certainly less successful, losing coherence but gaining stridency compared to those works.  In 'Emma', for example, the joy was in a precocious young heroine gradually learning that there were things she did not know; but haughty Fanny Price, the main character in this film, is always right, witty, invariably possessed of good judgment and anachronistic feminist attitudes - in other words, completely unbearable.  Some of the dialogue seems similarly out of time, the young Fanny and her sister are inexplicably played by a couple of self-consciously adorable American kids, and audience is consistently encouraged to apply modern values to judge the characters. Other things also seem odd (Fanny has lived with the family for many years, but they continually treat her as if she had just arrived; the social placement of Fanny, her aunt and mother are never explained; and as Fanny and the leading male are mutually in love throughout the story, it's hard to see why it takes them a whole film to get together).If one scene serves as a good example of what's wrong with this film, it's when Fanny catches a suitor in flagrante with another woman.  Jane Austen wrote highly subtle dissections of the social structures around her, disguised in the form of acceptable romances - that's the merit of her work.  The beauty of the story lies in the form of its telling.  The absence of explicit sex from (some) old books isn't necessarily a failing, just as you don't necessarily improve a classic thriller by remaking it with bigger guns and louder explosions. It's a small scene, but one senses that director Roezma doesn't really understand her own material.  A disappointment.

True, it's a poor telling of the novel, bits from which are stuck together without the structure of it being clearly conveyed or, apparently, recognized. Also true, it's filled with bad theatrical ideas, such as combining the heroine of the novel with Austen herself (and then casting the role with an actress who can play neither one). And also true, it's played less like an Austenian social comedy than like a half-baked version of Tom Jones. All these things notwithstanding, up to a point it's entertaining enough. (However, enough here means, as always in this usage, not quite enough. Halfway through the movie, not seeing much I recognized on screen, I turned to the novel, and found one paragraph of it more involving, amusing, and wise than everything in the movie rolled together. But let that pass.)Then came the Social Significance - as if Austen's novels were not full of social significance. Evidently the adapter disliked the nineteenth century, and Austen, and set out to show them up for what they were. I pretended to miss the insinuation of her father's having molested her and her sister--there being no other interpretation to be placed on the looks exchanged between the two of them and their mother when he gives Fanny a hug. But then Fanny turns up an album of atrocity pictures showing what her (almost) foster father, his son, and his crew were really getting up to with their slaves. This exceeds allowable bounds. Such a device might be imposed on Fielding, or on Dickens, without betraying the author's purpose too far; but not Austen. It obliterates the story, or what's left of it. In the face of rapes and beatings and tortures, who gives a fig whether Miss Price and her Reverend get together? Yet the comedy of manners continues galumphing along as if the scene had never happened. Having forced it in, the adapter makes no changes in the narrative to accommodate it. This is film-making for MTV watchers, i.e. patients with short-term memory loss. Ah - the adapter might counter - but that's just the point! The characters act as if these horrors didn't exist! To which I would reply if she felt, reading the novel, that the squire was just the kind of man who would have done that sort of thing, white European male pig that he was, and that Austen (owing to her famous ignorance of human nature, which causes her books to continue to be read two centuries later) was too much of a booby to see it, whereas the adapter's own superior sensibility makes all things manifest, she might at least have done Fanny the justice of having her react to the discovery as she would have, given her character. The story turns on her absolute moral rectitude and her rejection of the amorality represented by the Dangerous Liaisons characters. In the face of the dark deeds of which she becomes aware, her denunciation of the others becomes itself amoral and hypocritical, for she has silently acquiesced in the viciousness of her class. This conclusion must be extrapolated, since it is nowhere stated in the film, the adapter not having troubled to stir in the muck she has tossed into the pot. But I can't help wondering, if her object was to discredit Fanny, as well as the monsters around her--if she had so little use for the character as that--why did she choose to do this book?

I cannot believe that Patricia Rozema could have had any love for the book to create a story so blatantly ignorant of its origin.The characters, which were distorted beyond recognition, had no constancy as they were rapid-fired from scene to scene, without direction and without guide.Had Rozema at least had the decency to pace the story as it should have been, to select lines from the book which did serve as character-building stepping stones, and given Fanny the goodness, the gentility and submissiveness she carried through-out the novel, I could have looked less harshly on this film.I was also furious at Lady Bertram's opium addiction, at Mary Crawford's hints at lesbian tendencies, at Sir Thomas Bertram's motives and dealings in Antigua, and the complete unnecessary, though brief, nude scene with Maria Bertram and Henry Crawford.

The book Mansfield Park has a singularly unappealing protagonist in Fanny Price, a simpering and timid milksop, which was a big shock after Pride and Prejudice whose Elizabeth Bennett is surely one of the most enchanting fictional heroines ever.   The book is also dense and long without the trademark Austen lively wit.  And then, there is the confusing  play within play plot which further muddles the story.OK, I got that off my chest.  Phew.  Now about the movie. I enjoyed it very much in its own fashion.   It is rather unfaithful to the book, other than the general plot line.   That's not necessarily a bad thing.  In this free adaptation of Austen via Rozema, Fanny is portrayed as a determined woman, of intelligence, strength of character and mischief.  She is more Austen and Elizabeth Bennett than the Fanny from the book, and her appeal is magnified by the performance of the wonderfully expressive new Australian actress, Frances O'Connor.  They also canned the whole thing about the play (just barely skimmed over), thank God.  The story moves along briskly, starting with the poor relation Fanny coming to live with the rich Bertrams, then making friends with the second son Edmund whom she comes to love as she matures into young womanhood.   As with all Austen novels, it is about an independent-minded woman who finds her way into a wedded bliss, through many trials and tribulations.  Between Fanny and her heart's desires lay obstacles, mainly in the form of a very attractive but amoral pair of brother and sister, Henry and Mary Crawford.  Mary sets her sight on Edmund, and Henry, although initially interested in the empty-brained Bertram sisters, starts pursuing Fanny.  The chase begins as a challenge, but gradually turns into something resembling a genuine feeling.   In Rozema's hand, Henry is a scoundrel but is made rather appealing and sympathetic, someone who gives the annoyingly decent Edmund a fair competition.  Fanny almost gives into him (not so in the novel) and her resolution to hold onto her true love is made more courageous because of Henry's appeal.The movie is lovely to look at, and the music is appropriately frothy. The performances are variable, with the clear distinction in the outstanding Ms. O'Connor.   Embeth Davitz's turn as mercenary Mary is chilling, and Harold Pinter is excellent as the mercurial Sir Bertram, who is simultaneously affable and brutal. I had the  most problems with Johnny Lee Miller's Edmund, whose wooden delivery made me wonder why he had Fanny's devotion.The film's not a masterpiece by any stretch (and is inferior to SENSE AND SENSIBILITY in wit and to PERSUASION in heart), but nonetheless very enjoyable.  A lesser Austen is still an Austen, I guess.  The film also has a modern sensibility that's sometimes jarring.  There is a very 20th century outrage in slavery, quirky pauses in camera work, Fanny talking directly to the camera (tricky but it works) and even a hint of lesbianism that's rather uncalled forAt any rate, it's entertaining, different, and worth the price of admission just to see the luminous Frances O'Connor.   I feel I owe her a small debt of gratitude for making Fanny finally palatable, and for that, I expect grand things from this actress.

What is unmistakably a 20th century cast with 20th century manners dresses up and romps through it as a bodice ripper, completely missing the point that it's meant to be a study of social power structures breaking down in 18th century England.

In place of Austen's beautiful prose, Rozema's Mansfield Park delivers delicately crafted performances, heartbreakingly poetic cinematography, and a haunting score by Lesley Barber, but still manages to capture Austen's wit throughout.Frances O'Connor and Jonny Lee Miller (as Fanny Price and Edmund Bertram) carry the film with their subtlety and chemistry, and a few scenes between the two are enough to deem the film a masterpiece. But they are not the only merits the supporting cast breathe dimensionality to their characters with interesting interpretations of Austen's work. Most notable are Lindsay Duncan in her dual roles as Mrs Price and Mrs Bertram, and Victoria Hamilton as an intensely human Maria. Sophia Myles and Justine Waddell display equal genius albeit within the limitations of somewhat small roles. It is more difficult to gauge the performances of Alessandro Nivola and Embeth Davidtz; their characters are too affected by choices made in the script (arguably, Henry Crawford for the better and Mary Crawford for the worse).One can be a fan of Jane Austen and still appreciate the film. Although it bears little resemblance to the novel itself, it embodies much of the spirit of Austen and draws from her other novels where Mansfield Park the novel might be, dare I say, lacking. I am an ardent supporter of Austen, but I must say that the film version makes a commendable choice in choosing a protagonist that shares more of Pride and Prejudice's Elizabeth Bennett's spirit than the subdued Fanny of Mansfield Park.The film does, of course, have its flaws. The slavery issue is treated in a manner too heavy-handed to blend with Austen's style, and the same can be said of the hints of lesbianism that are just painfully out of place. The sexual tension is often a touch too overbearing in the film, although I agree with Rozema in saying that the film does not create this sexuality anew but draws from the tension latent in the novel (with the exception of the above-mentioned lesbianism). Other disappointments include Sir Bertram and Tom Bertram, who are practically caricatures that mar the otherwise brilliant characterization in the film.Regardless, the film's high points far outweigh its imperfections -- all in all, highly recommended.

Even the leading female and male characters in the film seem lost among the others due to a lack of contrast.  Worst of all is the most unimaginative use of narration that I can recall seeing in any film to date.

The director? The ACTORS? First, allow me to acknowledge that MP is the most sexual of Austen's books, dealing with Edmund's purely physical attraction to Mary, Fanny's rather incestuous love of Edmund (yes, I know that it was not strange to marry one's cousins in that time period, but her fraternal and romantic feelings are rather mixed up), the whole thing with Maria and Henry, and Mary's outward acknowledgment of it - she insists that the only way to get Henry to marry Maria is to let them keep living together, at which suggestion Edmund is properly horrified.However, Fanny Price was never, at any time in the book, witty, sharp-tongued, or sarcastic. She was clever and affectionate, but mild-mannered, sweet, and cripplingly shy. In fact, it's specifically stated in the book that Henry's persistence is due to Fanny's mildness and sweetness of manner, which makes her seem reluctant to refuse him. Not to mention that she was NINE YEARS OLD when she first got to Mansfield. Austen was fond of Fanny - she is the only heroine to whom the authoress refers to as her own (my Fanny) - but she was not meant to be a representation of Austen herself. From all letters and descriptions written by her family and friends, she appears to have been nearer to Elizabeth and Jane of Pride and Prejudice.I have no idea of the entertainment value of this movie, as I was too paralyzed with horror at what they had done to one of the most carefully-nuanced, well-written works in the English language by turning it into a disgusting farce.

They are usually extremely disappointing, so after I had finished reading Mansfield Park and moved on to the 1999 film I wasn't expecting much. What I was expecting was for the film to follow the basic ideas that Jane Austen was trying to convey. This was not the case. From the first five minutes I felt like I must have turned on the wrong movie.William's place was taken by 'Susie', Edmund's role as Fanny's adviser and helper has become a cheesy schoolyard crush, Sir Thomas is some sort of vulgar criminal, and even Fanny herself isn't the modest and shy persona that she is in the novel.Besides not following the basic elements of the story, the actual film is confusing. I am unsure whether the part where Fanny is seen accepting Henry Crawford's proposal was reality or merely a dream sequence. Also, the focus on black slavery seems to me, so out of place as to distract from the actual story at hand.We must remember that, although Fanny Price may seem dull to some, it is what she wasn't and what Austen doesn't make her that makes Mansfield Park so interesting.The worst part of this film, that I saw, was the completely ludicrous sex scene involving Crawford and Mrs Rushworth. At this point, I stopped watching. I find it quite ridiculous that we are encouraged to believe that this would have happened under Sir Thomas' roof. It is believable that these sinful occurrences would be able to be screened by the circumstances in London, however it is evident that Sir Thomas wouldn't have allowed these two to be in the same room together alone in his own home. This completely cheapened the film.As I didn't watch further than this point, I cannot comment on the remainder of the film. I sincerely hope that it did not get any worse, if it is possible that it could get worse.I wonder why so many have decided to take a Jane Austen novel to the big screen with little to no regard for the actual story. It seems more appropriate to make your own films, based on your own inferior story lines, and leave the name of Jane Austen out of it.I feel as though the creators of this film have completely ruined my enjoyment of Mansfield Park (the book) as I am forever doomed to think of this hideous film instead of one of Austen's most entertaining novels.If you have not yet watched Mansfield Park, I urge you not to. Find a better version, if there is one, but do not waste your time with this movie. If you have not yet read Mansfield Park, please take the time to read it as Jane Austen meant it to be and don't let the movie ruin your enjoyment of it.

In Austen's novel, Fanny is true to herself, but is a quiet fearful person who dreads change.  While this may not be an interesting focal point for today's audience, the character's immobility is intentional.  Fanny represents England at a time of great uncertainty.  Internally, the monarchy had been compromised by years of George III's insanity and his sons' frivolity.  Externally, the Napoleonic wars were threatening Europe.  England, like Fanny, was searching for stability and familiarity in a changing world.  This film totally undermines its source.  If you watch this movie, enjoy the costumes and the scenery.  Don't be fooled into thinking, however, that this production has anything to do with Jane Austen's Mansfield Park.

Couldn't she have made an original movie instead? A lot of people say they like it even though it is so different from the novel, but I can't do the same.

But if these characters existed in real life, I would trust Fanny over Elizabeth any day. As witty as Elizabeth is, her judgement is faulty (as a result, the 2nd half of the title is called prejudice). She cannot discern who Wickham is, and believed in his good appearance.

While following the overall outlines of Austen's book, it departs in a number of astonishing but very effective ways. In many ways I find it the most satisfying Austen adaptation I've seen.Modern eyes find the traditional Fanny Price to be too much of a, well, a wuss. She shows a steely resolve that anyone would envy when faced with a serious moral choice, but most of the time she's portrayed as timid and resigned to being trampled upon. Her moments of joy and excitement pass quietly. Such a character isn't especially appealing to today's moviegoers, and it's hard to make such a character engaging.Instead of giving us the traditional Fanny, Patrician Rozema (the director/screenwriter) has built a character with parts of Fanny and parts of Jane Austen herself. This Fanny will sit in her room during free hours and write stories home to her sister or write her History of England for her own (and her cousin Edmond's) amusement. She races down stairs, expresses her thoughtful but unorthodox opinions, rides in the rain, and does all sorts of other non-timid things. But her vivacity is squelched by Aunt Norris who constantly ensures that Fanny not forget her (low) status in the household.Another important departure is the opportunity we're given to finally look behind the curtains that hide the inconvenient piles of dirt. While Austen didn't always sidestep messy things, most Austen filmmakere have. But in Mansfield Park examples abound of plain old shabbiness. Mansfield Part is a huge pile of masonry (seems almost a palace to naive American eyes) but it's partially a ruin and it's frugally decorated, especially when compared to similar homes in Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility. Austen indicates that Lady Bertram suffers from poor health, but the film portrays an illness fueled by regular doses of narcotic medicines. Sir Thomas' problems at his New World plantation seem to be tied to his use of slave labor (with an ironic resolution at the end).As with the other '90s Austen revival works, this one shows much improved production values over the '80s BBC miniseries -- better use of musical scoring, more physical action by actors, and better use of locations and scenery.

Not only is the plot skimmed over and changed beyond all recognition, the characterisations are just...odd. WHY does every film of Mansfield Park show Lady Bertram as either an alcoholic, an opium addict (!) or, as we saw in the 1983 miniseries, plain old simple-minded? Are you telling me there are no longer any rich, idle women in the UK who prefer to shuffle off responsibility for their homes and children onto others in order to spend their time doing basically nothing? There certainly are in other parts of the world.Fanny Price as she is in the original novel starts out as a shy, frightened little girl who is trained to know her place--and that place is definitely at the bottom of the rich relations' totem pole. However in this version, she's an extroverted hoyden who speaks her mind in no uncertain terms. And why was it necessary to eliminate the important role of William, Fanny's loved and admired brother, to replace it with an apocryphally close relationship with Susan? Yes, Jane Austen and her sister were that close, but in the book Susan is almost a stranger to Fanny, having grown up in her absence.I could go on and on...but we'll end by saying that not even the decent performances offered by Mr Bertram and Mr Rushworth (who manages beautifully to be amusing and annoying at the same time without being cringe-making)could salvage the terrible way the film was rushed through to the end with scanty voice-off narration of all the important elements that were changed or totally left out, and the annoying, senseless repetition of things could have ended this way...but they didn't.This could have been an interesting, engaging film...but it wasn't.

Her acceptance and then rejection of mr Crawford in the film makes her seem very fickle and as for the ride in the rain! This is so out of charactar its laughable.  If you like this novel or any of Austen novels I assure you you will be very disappointed with this film.Simply as a film Mansfield Park isn't too bad.  it is fairly entertaining and does keep you interested throughout.  This is probably because of a strong performance by Frances O Connor as Fanny. Although nothing like Fanny of the novel it is a very fine believable and sincere performance and she manages to engage our sympathies like none of the other charactars.  The other actors are adaquate but noone except Fanny is remotely good or interesting, possibly because of the not very good script! There is nothing wrong with Jonny Lee Miller but he has to be one of the least charismatic actors around.  I was very surprised when I found out Mrs Price and Lady Bertram were played by the same actress(6 months after i watched it) and it is definitely one of the most interesting things about the film.  Still, both roles were basically cameos anyway.  I thought the tension was built well before Sir Thomas caught the family practicing Lovers vows but it was pointless becuase he didn't even get angry.  His lecture to Fanny about marrying Henry went on much too long and again he didn't even sound angry.  The camerawork is at points ridiculous - did the director want to prove they could do slow motion shots?  When the Crawfords enter, the camera moves slowly up to their faces and it didn't make it tense and exciting, just over the top.  As for the score.. what was going on there? one of the messiest scores ever too loud too often and didn't fit the film at all.Mansfield Park isn't awful but its nearer bad than good. Without the strong central performance it would be very poor.  For a wonderful adaptation of Jane Austen which is also a fantastic film in its own right, watch Ang Lees Sense and Sensibility. It is about 1000 times better than this.

But this movie was riddled with flaws. The script had been pretty much de-Austenized; I can't recall any witty lines--perhaps there were none. Much of the costuming, though reminiscent of the Regency period, seemed inauthentic somehow, especially Mary Crawford's black dress with lacy sleeves--it looked like something off the rack in Macy's evening wear. The music was loud, irritating, persistent, and oppressive, and it didn't fit the mood or the action. The camera's repeated zooming into too-close head shots was bizarre and uncalled for. And the aura of sexual perversion was alien to the Austen genre; in fact this brooding film seemed rather more Daphne du Maurier than Jane Austen.If you are not offended by such bastardizations, by all means see the movie.

The cast was delightful, and Francis O'Connor and Jonny Lee Miller captured the essence of their characters as written by Jane Austen.  I realize that any film adaptation of a novel is bound to be lacking in some respects, but there were two major changes to the story which were too drastic for me to accept.First, Austen's Fanny Price is steady and sure in her convictions, but the Fanny in the film is lacking the strength of character that makes her such a great heroine.  Second, the film introduces an unnecessary and inappropriate subplot about Sir Thomas' involvement in slavery.  It creates tension between Fanny and Sir Thomas and changes his character completely.  Sir Thomas in the novel is a loving, if somewhat restrained, benefactor who develops a real affection for his niece; the film portrays him as a sometimes cruel and certainly callous man who feels he is doing a great service by providing his poor niece with the opportunity to better her station through a loveless but financially and socially beneficial marriage.

Fanny Price is nothing like she is in the book, the other characters have been equally changed for the worst and as far as I could tell hardly any of Austen's witty prose has been retained!! It seems this adaptation is 'Mansfield Park' in name only.This is probably the most difficult of Austen's novels to bring to the big screen because the characters are so much a product of their time. Fanny is supposed to be shy, submissive, compassionate and pious. She was never outspoken, headstrong or feisty. In short, she is not Elizabeth Bennet and she never will be. To attempt to portray Fanny in this light is missing the point of her whole character. She is dull and boring by today's standards, but her disposition was admirable during the time that she lived.I really don't know what the filmmakers were thinking with this adaptation - they probably weren't!! At any rate, it is only because Jane Austen is long dead that they would dare to produce this version. If you haven't read the book you'll probably enjoy it.

It is full of party bubble in the early evening, strange lovemaking at midnight and a splitting headache in the morning. The movie is Mansfield Park, and it is reminiscent of Miss Jane Austen's longest and best novel. The novel plays the part of one Lady Scenario who is invited to a Hollywood party. When she arrives, Lady Scenario finds herself in the hands of a silent film director whose interest is to improve the story. The scenarist says, Dear, we really need to do something about you before my guests arrive. Sitting to watch, she orders her servants to strip Lady Scenario to her bodice. The director then begins the process of filming the adopted child wearing various fantastic garments.The principal fantastic garment in this film is the makeover of Fanny Price. Miss Austen's Fanny Price is pious and patient. She is a Christian woman in possession of great spiritual strengths. These guide her when she finds herself wary and unsure of the intentions of those around her. The novel generates a good deal of moral tension as the world (Mansfield Park) tries to corrupt her, to make her believe she is a prig, all the while she attempts to understand her changing feelings about Edmund and Frank. The film's Fanny is a budding author, whose writings comprise Miss Austen's juvenilia. She has some mischievous opinions about the world, an untidy disdain for Miss Norris and a certainty that she has the moral goods on the people. The problem with this approach is that the screenwriter's opinions about how things should progress keep colliding with the reality of Miss Austen's story. Everywhere in this film the bubbles fly, as the director wrings and twists poor Miss Price through one scene after another. For this film's Fanny to want to marry Edmond in the end is perilously close to illogical and hypocritical.We ought not entirely to blame the director and screenwriter for this. In the context of a two-hour movie, it would take good intellectual leaven to raise Miss Norris beyond being merely heartless and the Crawford siblings beyond the merely lifeless. The resulting Mansfield Park movie has the thrills and titillations of an old silent film. And an organ accompanies the film. This organ usually puffs out something that sounds like Miss Austen, but when it thunders, loudly, we find ourselves in a scene more like a modern morality play.One can only wonder how this loud organ cry ever found its way into a comedy of manners. The screenwriter is intrigued by black slavery, women disrobing women, and the idea that a woman who might be an author has a superior moral voice. These fetishes intrude everywhere like unwanted guests reeking of absinthe. The screenwriter would do her interests more good, it seems, if she were to make a movie about the current issue of black slavery in the Sudan. Or perhaps she could combine her interests and cleverly reverse black/white roles by filming Evelyn Waugh's Black Mischief. At the end of this new film, we could wickedly watch as the black women slowly disrobe the Englishwoman Prudence before preparing her for their dinner.Then there is the business of Fanny the budding author. No doubt there are talented alter-ego's for Jane Austen in her books (I think of Jane Fairfax in Emma), but Miss Austen's clarity of vision precluded making any of these women more exalted than one might find in general society. That meant no one of Miss Austen's rare talents could exist in her novels. To remake the retiring Fanny of the novel into an author with an attitude, and to give her the familiarity with Edmund Bertram she enjoys throughout the movie, are modern touches that blanch and spoil the terror of Mansfield Park. It is as trite and nerveless an approach as the current trend to replace Christmas Trees with Holiday Trees.What a lost opportunity. Mansfield Park is not one, but two, perhaps three movies. The first film need not taking us any farther than Chapter 10, which concludes the Southerton expedition, a gold mine of character study that properly handled could overtop a decade of European film making.But for now, I just have a splitting headache.

While most people can enjoy reading about Elizabeth Bennet or even the spoiled Emma Woodhouse, Fanny Price has always been the irritating goody girl nobody would really want to talk to for very long.

Rozema seems interested in Jane Austen, and interested in life during the early 19th century, so I don't know why she didn't just make an Austen biopic, rather than filming a novel whose plots and characters she doesn't really seem to like. Rozema can't figure out how to handle the mild character of Fanny, so she changes her into the typical feisty heroine, borrowing material from Austen's real life to bolster the idea. Personally, I think it would be an interesting challenge for a filmmaker to create a likable character who is meek, so I was disappointed that Rozema didn't try it.Rozema approaches the material from a very modern perspective, making Sir Thomas Bertram a sexist slaveowner rather than the more complex character Austen created, and dwelling on the physical discomforts of living in the early 1800s. These issues would have been interesting to explore within a different story, but Mansfield Park is not about these topics, and in my opinion, the changes don't work. For example, we're suddenly expected to laugh at Bertram's humorous final line at the end of the movie, when we've hated him for the rest of it. Rozema's approach can also be heavyhanded Maria Bertram hisses I can't get out!, just in case the audience didn't quite get that the story comments on imprudent marriages, and when Tom Bertram gets sick, the audience is treated to closeups of him vomiting.Rozema is a talented filmmaker in some ways the visual images of the film are very memorable and unusual. But her handling of Mansfield Park does injustice both to Austen's novel and the other issues Rozema wants to explore slavery is too important a topic to relegate to a subplot.

This painting's style & subject matter (self-portrait of the artist behind his easel, and behind him the figure of a slave in chains) would have been impossible in 1806, probably even in 1906.  The sketchbook that Fanny finds later bothered me less, because it consists of quick charcoal sketches, meant to be private--but the idea that the family (or Tom himself) could have framed such a painting & hung it on the wall is inconceivable.  It would not only have been regarded as ugly, but as symptomatic of the artist's insanity.  Remember, the time setting of this movie (1806) is years before the Impressionists, even, whose early works were thought of as ugly simply because the technique was unfamiliar.  Thomas Lawrence or Sir Joshua Reynolds would have been appropriate for the walls of Mansfield Park, or an amateur daubing in style somewhat similar to these masters.  The use of this painting was supposed to prepare us for Tom's later breakdown at the prospect of being the heir of a slave-owner, & also to reinforce the caged bird motif which links Fanny, an unpaid domestic servant, with the slaves in the slave ship, but its crudity makes me blush for the director who undoubtedly had the funding--but not the knowledge of art history--to arrange for something appropriate and convincing.   I did think the parallel between Fanny's writing & Tom's art was interesting--the theme of artistic expression as a way out for the caged bird.  It made me wonder why Fanny & Tom are never seen communicating.  He seems more like a kindred spirit than Edmund.  As I recall, in the novel he was nothing but a wastrel--but it's a long time since I've read Mansfield Park, so I'm not about to compare the novel to the movie.

The other sister married a man for his money and connections and this position allows her to extend some help to her poor sister's family.Using that connection, the poor sister sends her pre-teen daughter, Fanny, to finish growing up in her wealthy sister's household. This was not uncommon at the time, in a sense playing a lottery hoping that upon maturity--living in that wealthier setting--Fanny would meet and marry a man of sufficient means that she'd be able to rescue some or all of her natal family.The movie primarily shows the social life of young unmarrieds in this English gentry household while also presenting Fanny's dilemma whether to go the route of her mother or of her aunt--or, can she find (or be allowed to find) some alternative in between? Austen's works often reflected the plight of women trapped in that era's social system (& subtly encouraged change?). Those wanting a literal translation of the book into a movie may be disappointed. The director (Rozema) used the book's basic plot line but transformed this film's Fanny into one very similar to Jane Austen's actual character as well having many of the experiences and issues Austen faced in her own life. Frances O'Connor does a superb job as Rozema's Austenized Fanny and Harold Pinter as Sir Thomas was also great.While times have fortunately changed a bit since that era, there are aspects of making such marital decisions that are still present now and will be as long as people need to make choices of why they will marry and whom (or whom they will marry and why).On the surface a light, period chick flick piece but with some unobtrusive, underlying serious threads.

Fanny is the most altered; she has more spunk (waaaaaaaay more spunk, possibly more than is easy to forgive for die-hard Austen fans) and Frances O'Conner is more attractive than Fanny seems to be described in the novel (or as portrayed by the actress in the mini-series.) She is also fashioned a bit as a reflection of Jane Austen herself as a writer of love stories, and even a very subjective POV of a History of England novel much like that actually written by Miss Austen as a teenager. Sir Thomas' character is written a little darker and of course the slavery issue becomes one of the centerpieces of the story, something that was glossed over so lightly in the novel and the mini-series that it was barely noticeable. Indeed, it may be brought too much forward to forgive for die-hard Austen fans. I will leave it to others who are better informed and educated than I am to decide whether the 1990's politically-correct ideologies of the young people in this early 19th century story seem unrealistically anachronistic.However, as a movie by itself, viewed as inspired by rather than based upon the novel, it works very well. It is interesting and the characters and enhanced story lines are mostly well-thought out. Tom Bertram, Jr. is a tortured artiste, and is not just an idle playboy, but one who is desperately trying to distract himself from the great burden of guilt he carries regarding how his family's fortune is made on the sweat, tears and broken backs of forced, slave labor. The only characters who really do remain truthful to the novel are Lady Bertram and Aunt Norris. I like that it is brought right out in the open that Lady B is a borderline alcoholic (if she hasn't actually crossed over that line.) While Edmund is portrayed still very closely to how he was originally written, he, too, is given a little more of an edge. A little side observation Embeth Davidtz, who plays Mary Crawford, so much resembles Jackie Smith-Wood, who played the same character in the '83 mini-series that she could be Smith-Wood's daughter (or at least her much-younger sister.)The ladies' costumes are gorgeous, the prettiest I've ever seen in any Jane Austen film/TV adaptation.

I always thought her novels to be boring insipid and simpering when force upon us as unwilling students in English Lit classes. Full of dull characters, doing dull things, in even more dull times I thought. Perhaps I have never quite grown out of this, having never been able to bring myself to read Jane Austen to this day. But I have seen some wonderful movies and TV series based on her novels and have loved them - a tribute perhaps both to my growing maturity (after all I am now 50) as well as the reach of a good cinematic production. In short this adaptation has seemed to be hated by the Jane Austen true believers while loved by others. The true believers will find it not to be authentic enough no doubt. But I am one of those others. While there are aspects of the production that seem odd- the attitudes displayed do seem a little modern for Austen and why on earth did they choose such a ramshackle run down old dump for Mansfield Park? But it is entertaining and delightful. I predict most will thoroughly enjoy it, if not love it. - Even in all of its Jane Austen predictability of outcome!

Why not just write the script and make a movie and not make the fraudulent claim that it is an accurate representation of a book by Jane Austen? The only things in common with the book were the title, the names of a half dozen characters and a few scattered plot points. Decent movie, but gets an awful rating b/c its basically a fraud.

Not much as an adaptation -- let's face it, there would be no modern audience for a direct retelling of *Mansfield Park*, with its Brontë-ish moral underpinnings and antiquated ideals, much as I personally might agree with them. It is a very different creature from the novel on which it is loosely based, in more ways than one. Ack, the undertones of lesbian eroticism were a bit too much, really, and the slavery subtext with all it entailed was, I thought, an unnecessary addition. However, it does touch on some of the main themes quite well. What makes this movie enjoyable for me, though, when I manage to mentally separate it from the novel I love, is the pretty and somewhat unconventional directing. And unlike many reviewers here I think Frances O'Connell did a wonderful job as Fanny; in fact I thought the whole cast was well-selected and did a fine job.

I am a Jane Austen fan and purist, and was not offended that this version did not stick avidly to the book. The acting was solid and the characters believable (no strings, no wood) I am a big fan, have read the book many times and the characters were well matched to the actors, even if the central story deviated a bit.I give this 9/10 for a chick flick period drama with a happy ending (as all in this genre should be) and a 6/10 for a strict version of Mansfield Park. This 6/10 does not detract from the enjoyment of the film in my opinion.It states clearly in the opening credits that the film is based on Jane Austen's letters, her Juvenilla stories AND Mansfield Park so in this version the character of Fanny Price is given a generous nod to the characters and events in the life of Jane Austen, which is a new and interesting twist and nice for those who are fans of Austen and not just the 6 novels. Fanny in the film is not as reserved and put upon as Fanny of the book, but this is where the Jane Austen letters come in, and I would like to believe that Fanny of the film is just as worthy a heroine (because after all we all love Jane too).As with all movies of a good book there are omissions that some may find frustrating, but the parallels with Jane Austen's life; her early writings of the Juvenilla stories and her reading them to her beloved sister, her first accepting then refusing the marriage proposal a day later, all added to the charm of this version.I am pleased that I got over myself and the negative reviews I had previously read and decided to give it a go. It is worth watching, and to all the nay sayers out there, No it really is not that bad, there are many film version that are unwatchable, but this is not one of them.

He is the most intelligent adapter of books for film that has yet been produced, having written the wonderfully self-referential 'French Lieutenant's Woman.' 'French' is one of the ten best-written films in history -- and Streep's most multidimensional performance too!Pinter's (yet unfilmed) screenplay for Proust is studied by every film student; he has even done Kafka. So his involvement here set high promise.What is attempted is something worthy of a Pinter a multidimensional folding of making a writer equivalent to one of her characters; to make a book about the writing of a book; to submit that containment in the book is like slavery or (the feminist statement) a marriage without love. Along the way, the filmmaker further intends to expand a relatively weak (for Austin) book in ways thought to preserve its intent as if Austin were writing for film.Most of the artists involved in this film are of high caliber. The problem is that none are of the caliber needed to achieve the level required of the aspirations. An interesting attempt though. I think we should celebrate the intent even though it misses the mark. How else will we encourage intelligence and risk-taking?

Not that I find her works boring but they simply aren't my cup of tea. I read Pride and Prejudice in a first year literary class, but it was a fairly dull experience for me, and I have never picked up Mansfield Park once.As a film, it is not even an eventful one. A kind of coming to age, rags to riches and back again kind of plot line. Although there were some beautiful settings and some extremely nice costuming, I never really felt that I was witnessing this period drama in the 1800's. I was trying not to laugh at most of the actors, taking themselves exceptionally seriously in roles that they obviously did not fit in. The main character was rather blasé at best. The morality of some of the characters were simply selfish, even when they were not trying to be, by simply trying to improve their social settings. By the end of the film, nobody had really changed, but just become more aged and experienced as one would expect. In the end, the women of the story overcome their respective obstacles and then it stops like an overly long bus trip. You need a meal and a nap at the end of this film.I would assume you have to enjoy Jane Austin novels to enjoy this film.

The photography and production design are exquisite. What a far cry this is from Hollywood's remakes of the classics in the 30s and 40s, with everything shot in black and white on a studio sound stage. Majestic landscapes in full bloom. And what must it be like to live in Cornwall and bear the brunt of all those westerly gales? Mendocino County write large.The performances are top notch as well. I don't know how closely the characters resemble Jane Austen's, never having read the novel, but independent of her text they can stand on their own two feet. And not just the performances but the casting. As Fanny Price, Frances O'Connor looks and acts like a properly British Jessica Harper. Embeth Davidz is paralyzing cool and pragmatic. I can't figure out just who plays Fanny's mother in Portsmouth but she's emblematic of the poor around the world, pinched and weathered. I had no idea that Harold Pinter was an actor as well as a writer.I can't say that the plot is gripping. Well, I guess it is, in a way. The problem is that it's so similar to other lavish soap operas in which everybody is in love with the wrong person for reasons of affection or social status -- vide, Far From the Madding Crowd, Gone With The Wind, and on and on. Dickens worked such themes into his novels as well, but he added a dash of social commentary, of engagement with the world outside the mansion. And he played recklessly with the English language Oh, JOY! What a reversal of desolation. Austen seems sedate by comparison.Patricia Rozema is a winning director, hitting all the right notes. No fancy directorial fireworks, no razzle dazzle, and the stylistic touches come at just the right places, as in the epilogue, in which characters freeze into tableaux just long enough for a summary of their fates. "},{"Title":"Based on the novel by Jane Austen AND journals and letters","Date":"29 June 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" If one reads the opening credits, shortly after the young Fanny climbs into the carriage at the beginning of film, you will find the words Based on the novel by Jane Austen, Mansfield Park, early journals and letters. Therefore the movie makers do indicate that this movie is NOT purely a book adaptation, albeit in small print. In truth, this movie is half Mansfield Park, half Becoming Jane.I would have been very upset with the film if I had not read the above-mentioned caveat (even having been fore-warned by IMDb users that this movie was highly inaccurate), but knowing this made the world of difference in understanding WHY they made the changes that they did.Fanny doubles up in character as Jane Austen herself, which is the biggest flaw in the plan, seeing as most interpretations of Jane portray a very independent woman--quite the polar opposite of Fanny Price. The problem is, the director or writer didn't quite make up their mind which way to portray Fanny/Jane, so sometimes she is outgoing and feisty, and sometimes shy and submissive, so the character in the movie is very inconsistent.Edmund, Fanny's cousin, doubles up as Jane's beloved brother, Henry. Edmund falls for Mary Crawford; Henry Austen fell for his older widowed cousin Eliza de Feuillide, against the wishes of his sister Jane and the rest of the family. This coincides with Fanny disliking Edmund's affection for Mary, and also gives an excuse for picking an actress of whom my first impression was, She's too old to play Mary. And Fanny's unladylike playfulness with Edmund makes more sense in the light of how Jane likely behaved with Henry.Henry Crawford doubles up as Tom Lefroy, the source of some speculated flirtation in Jane's life, as well as Harris Bigg-Wither, the man from whom Jane accepts a proposal one day and retracts it the following morning. This is the reason why they make Fanny in the movie accept Henry Crawford and then decline him, even though in the book Fanny declines him consistently and emphatically. It was tempting in both cases to marry someone with financial competency. And I think the Tom Lefroy side of it is why they have Fanny engage in some verbal jousting and teasing with Henry Crawford and have her enjoying his company on occasion.Fanny's correspondent and best sibling-friend in the book is her brother William. Her sister Susan is substituted in this role in the movie to play the fill-in Cassandra, Jane's only sister and her confidante, frequently by extensive correspondence whenever they were separated.Other tie-ins to Jane Austen's life is that they have Fanny being an aspiring writer. Fanny writes a History of England, as Jane did in earlier years, and it appears that the lines Fanny says in the movie about some of the kings of England may be snippets from that writing. When Edmund refers to Fanny having a new modern way of writing, it is because she was parodying older history books. The other stories she concocts and relates to her sister appear to come from other pieces in Jane's Juvenilia.Understanding that the movie makers were combining fiction with biography made the digression from the novel's plot more understandable, but I think they should have taken more effort to make this apparent to viewers. No one in their right mind should put the title of a Jane Austen book on a movie that does not closely follow the story for fear of raising the hackles of the many purists out there (myself among them). It was an interesting idea they had, but not well-advertised enough of a concept to excuse themselves. If they had even tweaked the title a little, such as Jane's Mansfield Park, it might have better alerted the audience that the movie is not just the book verbatim and has more to do with Jane herself.Now, I like the idea, once presented as such, but was it well-executed? Moderately so. The big problem was, as I suggested, having one actor filling two roles simultaneously, rolled up together. Fanny came out a bit wishy-washy. Edmund did all right generally, but it was hard to see that he ever really loved Mary with the infatuated devotion he has for her in the book, which makes Fanny's fear of losing him less grounded. Fanny's unwavering love for Edmund (in the book) is diminished, as well, because of her flirtations and temporary acceptance of Henry (in the movie). And of course the entire plot is rather rushed through to try to fit in 2 hours--a problem for any Austen novel--so many details and character development are lost.However, in spite of the negatives, and in spite of wishing this had been a purist adaptation, we still are left with an enjoyable Regency-era movie, full of great sets and pretty costumes (a few looked a bit off to me as far as accuracy goes, but we'll set that aside and try to appreciate the aesthetics as they are). It's a basic time-period rom-com, if not a true work of Austen, and as such I intend to like it for its own merits, in its own right, and not for its namesake.And considering that many readers dislike Fanny as an Austen heroine, changing her character likely made this more appealing to a broader audience; if you are one such reader, you may find this movie even better than the book. (I think Fanny is grossly underrated as a heroine, but that is another argument.) If you are on the fence about whether to watch this (as I have been for years, before finally deciding to give it a chance), make up your mind to pretend this is a different story altogether, not Mansfield Park, and perhaps you will find room to like it.

(Fanny's mother and Lady Bertram are sisters). Fanny falls in love with her cousin Edmund, the younger son of the family, who is in training for the priesthood, but he seems to be infatuated with the beautiful Mary Crawford. Fanny herself is pursued by Mary's brother Henry, but she distrusts him and rejects his proposal of marriage.Mansfield Park is, of all Jane Austen's novels, perhaps the most difficult to adapt for the screen. The main difficulty lies in the character of its heroine, Fanny Price, a quiet, timid girl to a modern audience can seem at best dull and insipid and at worst self-righteous and priggish Kingsley Amis went so far as to describe her as morally detestable. This difficulty has not, however, dissuaded film-makers from trying to adapt the novel, as there have been two different screen versions during the last fifteen years. This film, dating from 1999, was the first; the second was the ITV television film from 2007 starring Billie Piper. Both films adopted a similar approach to what might be called the Fanny problem, namely to rewrite the novel. Austen's Fanny is a shy, timid, sickly introvert. Fanny as played by both Piper and Frances O'Connor is an attractive, healthy, outgoing, self-confident and extroverted young woman, closer in spirit to some other Austen heroines such as Elizabeth Bennett or Catherine Morland. Both interpretations, especially Piper's, were attacked by the critics, but in my view the decision to reinterpret the character in this way was the correct one. What works on the printed page does not always work well on the screen, and a film which attempted to preserve the Fanny of Austen's novel would probably come out as intolerably dull, like the lifeless BBC TV series made in the eighties. The film's writer and director Patricia Rozema does, however, make further changes to the novel which work less well. In the original book, Fanny's family were not poor in any absolute sense, but only poor in comparison to the aristocratic Bertram family. By Regency standards they were middle-class; her father was a retired naval officer and they even employed servants of their own. In this version, however, her father is a labourer and the family live in quite genuine poverty. Given the snobbery of the age, it is difficult to imagine the Bertrams even acknowledging such an embarrassing family connection; if they wanted to do Fanny a kindness they might have offered her a position as a servant, but not as a companion to their daughters. Moreover, O'Connor's character speaks with a middle-class accent and displays evidence of a level of education far beyond that of most working-class girls of the period. Austen's novel did mention that Sir Thomas Bertram had business interests in the West Indies, from which it is fair to infer that he was in some way involved with slavery. This is not, however, a subject dealt with in the book; Austen had never visited the Caribbean and had no first-hand knowledge of slavery. The film, however, makes this into a major theme, with a whole sub-plot revolving around the issue. Sir Thomas's elder son Tom, who in the novel is a hard-drinking, profligate fop, here becomes a sensitive young man who returns home deeply disturbed by what he has seen in Antigua and it is implied that he becomes ill as a result of the shock to his nerves. There are other changes made to Austen's story. It is strongly implied, for example, that Mary Crawford is bisexual and attracted to Fanny. Henry and Maria Rushworth carry on their adulterous affair under the noses of her family in their own home; Fanny actually discovers them in flagrante delicto. The trouble with these changes is that they ignore the moral stance of Jane Austen's work without putting anything substantial in its place. Mansfield Park is an essentially conservative (with a small c) work, a critique of what she saw as the looseness and corruption of the progressive morality of her day, exemplified by the dissolute Crawford siblings. Rozema tries to turn it into something much more politically radical, touching on modern concerns such as racism, gay sexuality and the class system but it just does not work as such. Subjects such as slavery in the nineteenth-century Caribbean, working-class poverty in nineteenth-century Britain, or even lesbianism in the Georgian era, might all make interesting subjects for a film, but I would not recommend Austen's novel as the starting-point for a film on any of them. This film was not a great critical success, but was not savaged quite as much as the ITV film, highly unpopular among bilious Janeites who loathed the idea of the former teenage pop star and pin-up Billie Piper, Britain's answer to Britney Spears, as an Austen heroine. (O'Connor, an Australian actress little known in Britain at the time, carried no such unwelcome cultural baggage with her). Yet I actually preferred the ITV version which, in my view, steered a successful middle course between staying too slavishly close to the original and departing too radically from it. This version has some good points; as normal with heritage cinema the costumes and the setting (Kirby Hall in Northamptonshire) are attractive and there are good acting contributions from O'Connor and Harold Pinter as Sir Thomas. Rozema's film, however, strikes me as a classic example of a film which does indeed depart too radically from the book on which it is ostensibly based, using it in an ill thought-out attempt to support a quite different political and moral agenda from the one the author had in mind. 5/10 "},{"Title":"A Good Story Ruined","Date":"10 May 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" How utterly annoying this film is for Austen fans.

They change some of the points of the story by elaborating some things that they merely brushed over in the book. They don't emphasize certain other things that the characters feel, say or do but they do it without alteration of the essence of the character. (I will not point them out here for those of you who haven't read the book so as not to draw your eye to it when you watch the movie.) They also change the spot of where things happen, or how they happen but you still get the core of the characters across, so no harm done.Other than those small changes I think that this movie is very well done. No book-to-movie translation is exactly like the book. They must make artistic changes because you can't see exactly what the character is feeling or thinking. The casting was brilliantly done because the actors chosen don't overshadow the character they are meant to portray; although I think they gave the audience a more favourable persona in Edmund. In the movie he is protective and affectionate of Fanny (which he is in the Novel as well) but without the pass-over kind of affection that it was. In the novel he would sometimes seem to the reader unworthy of her affections just because he was so blasé towards her and her opinions that you would think him a bit of a snob. The movie cuts that out and makes him seem like the perfect man personified. Fanny was excellent, she was just as awkward and unsure yet lovely and well spoken as the Fanny in the book. The language of the script is considerably well written and the way that they speak pulls you into the storyline.Overall this is a good movie for period piece fans, but for the Austen fans who want an exact screen portrayal of their beloved book, they might be a tiny bit let down.

Any work of literature is subject to interpretation, but the essence of the book, and the intentions of the author is completely destroyed in this version. Any Jane Austen fan will find this movie rather strange. This is not Jane Austen's England. It's the director's vision of what Jane Austen's view of England at that time should have been.

I actually nearly stopped reading the book because of how much emphasis was on how badly her aunt treated her. Austen made the point to such a point that I nearly put the book down. And the lectures of the aunt and her uncle just seemed to go on and on and on. Just based on those changes, I actually think the movie is better.

Well, coming from someone who didn't read the book, I found the main character to be of pristine moral character.I admired how she went with her gut, despite how easy it would have been for her to marry the other man, and despite the opposition from the family. So far as the other points of immorality, I didn't see much of it. I mean, yes they had the love scene where the heroine walks in on the couple in bed. There was no raunchiness to this There was no erotic lovemaking that you caught a glimpse of. It didn't seem overdone and it seemed appropriate.The only thing that disturbed me and seemed unnecessary however were the pictures in the drawing book. There were scenes of rape and sexual gratuity concerning slaves, and this not only disturbed me, but seemed non-consequential to the plot. It was unclear whether or not these pictures were of things that actually happened, although the old man's reaction and appearance of shame did seem to point to that the pictures did represent something that happened. I did not like this at all.In the end, it seemed that being a moral prevailed however, as the two people who always did the right thing whom you hoped would somehow be together, did get together. To me, it seemed that the people who did evil were in some fashion punished for their crimes by the consequences that comes from doing these things. For example, the man that said it was safe to flirt with a married woman, or the woman that said that she was in an unhappy marriage so she had a right to cheat, basically ended up being out of luck in the end from the consequences of cheating.Then there was the part when heroine made a decision to marry that man and then changed her mind. I know that some people were disturbed by this. To me, it seemed realistic that she would begin to fancy the idea of him, and it was both shocking and admirable that she was able to go with her brain over her heart and say no, even after making the mistake. I thought maybe it was because she was just afraid to let herself fall for someone, but, in the end she showed herself to move forward without fear when it was with the man whom she loved and knew was right for her.Anyway, I enjoyed this film. It was an inspiration, although a small one. It wasn't something I will remember forever, but it gave me something to think about. By the way, the acting was great. I also quite liked the heroine's sister, and wished to see more of how her life turned out.

One of the main characters was viciously villainized and unfairly portrayed. There were unneeded and gross scenes which just ruined the movie. I then went and read the book to see which version was correct and was greatly relieved to find out that the original BBC version, which has a great story, was totally accurate.

But anyone who has ever seen a film version of a really good book must know that there's NO WAY to reproduce the novel's intricacies or pace in a film. The script writer has to discard a lot more than he or she keeps and that means a simplified plot line and character development that the book's admirers are bound to find deficient. That's perfectly fine with a Tom Clancy novel because -- invitation to flames -- all they've got is a plot and cardboard characters. Same with a lot of other authors of pulp fiction. Jane Austen's novels are subtle and carefully observed -- and no movie can possibly match those characteristics. If you really love a book, you might be well advised to skip the film. One thing that needs to be said, however. Frances O'Connor is not a typical American girl -- she's British as are most, perhaps all, of the actors in this movie. And pay attention to the lord of the manor who is played by Harold Pinter, the famous playwright. In his subsidiary role, he's the star of the film (though nowhere near as beautiful as Ms. O'Connor).

In addition to the taboos about depicting perversion and depravity, apparently there is the one about being unfaithful and by implication, disrespectful to a great literary work.  But even among literary adaptations there seem to be shades of disapproval.  No-one seems to worry about what is done to works like Fielding's Tom Jones or Swift's Gulliver's Travels, but heaven help the poor person who may one day make the first feature film (it has already been done as a quite respectable TV serial) of George Eliot's Middlemarch.  Proust adaptations don't seem to cause much eyebrow raising possibly because most readers, like me, will give anything to get to grips, however simplistic the means, with the most challengingly unreadable of all great novels.  But when we come to Jane Austen we are clearly on sacred ground.  Any attempt to tinker with the Regency goddess of the written word will, if not quite up to the mark, unleash the wrath of Austen aficionados the length and breadth of the cultivated world.  Of all directors and adaptors who have placed their heads in this lion's mouth, Ang Lee is one of the very few who did not get his bitten off when he remained relatively faithful to Sense and Sensibility.  And yet is not his a relatively tame piece of cinema when compared to the high jinks of Hollywood's Victorian dressed version of Pride and Prejudice and certainly the heresies of Patricia Rozema's Mansfield Park with its nude copulation scene, Sir Thomas's frenzied destruction of his son's horrific sketches of cruelty to Negro slaves and Mary Crawford's cry of exasperation, This is 1806, for Heaven's sake!  Let me stand and be counted, I have no scruples about admiring a film that takes liberties with a great source if in so doing a new work of outstanding, albeit different, quality is the result.  I won't say that Mansfield Park is my favourite Austen adaptation - I have great affection for the sheer playfulness of the old Olivier/Garson Pride and Prejudice - but as pure cinema the new film is wonderful stuff.  It may verge on the melodramatic (the last hour in particular) or indulge in the quirky (Mr. Norris's death - just like one of Truffaut's black comedy jokes in Tirez sur le Pianiste in a way that is completely alien to Jane Austen's style, but is is a work full of heart and feeling.  I really believed that Fanny and Edmund were made for one another.  When it seemed that they might drift apart I was sad and when they came together at the end quite overcome with joy.  It is not that the director treats the relationship simplistically.  It has an internal development nowhere more beautifully expressed than in the scene where Edmund fetches Fanny from Portsmouth so that she might attend his ailing brother.  Their hands touching during the coach ride back to Mansfield Park is the film's powerful and emotional turning point, a moment so tender that all arguments about source faithfulness seem irrelevant.  This is a fine film in its own right.

First, I don't recommend the movie; second, I don't recommend the novel. After watching the movie, I was left dumbfounded. There is no elaboration on the kinship developed between Fanny and Edmund(there is not much more in the novel either); it is simply implied. As in most all cases, a movie adaptation can never surpass or better the original work.A novel such as Mansfield Park meticulously places emphasis on character-development. Fanny Price has a disposition and temperament manifested best from incidents and predicaments she deals with throughout the novel. Austen's own interpretation and diagnosis of Fanny gives insight into the character the movie cannot. The movie does a poor job of displaying the physiognomy of a subtle, yet complicated character.The trivialities and superfluity placed in the plot made it seem incredulous, i.e., the relationship between Fanny and Mr. Crawford. The novel better explains Mr. Crawford and his disposition to Fanny and society in general.It would be a most monumental, prodigious task to show not only Mr. Crawford and Fanny's quiet histrionics, but most of the characters in the novel; especially Edmund.I'm with the consensus on the notion that this movie should not be called Mansfield Park. Doing a movie adaptation of this novel would be a thankless task; a director would take less acrimony and excoriation being president.

And at last who can ever forget the fantastic mini series of Pride and Prejudice (also from the BBC) which is the finest of all. But Mansfield Park too, is up there with the rest. Frances O'Connor played Fanny Price to perfection and the characters in this adaptation, in my opinion, were very true to the novel. This version did creep away form the novel, but it wandered in the best direction. Sumptuous acting and cinematography paved the way for this visionary splendor and the romance between Fanny and Edmond was every bit as poignant as it was in the book. Mary Crawford and Henry Crawford had a very earthy presence in the film masked by early 19th century demeanor and these characters (you know the ones who love to hate and for a moment I even pitied Henry a bit until...)were played wonderfully by Embeth Davitz and Alessandro Nivola.

Austen's novels are slow, delicate sketches, not terribly suited for film.This particular novel, Mansfield Park, is rather problematic for adaptation, as its heroine, Fanny Price, is a quiet, introspective creature -- hard to get to know and like.  If it takes an entire novel to appreciate Fanny, how can that be accomplished in a 90-minute movie?  The filmmaker accomplished this by changing Fanny's character.  In the movie, she is far spunkier than in the novel.  It's not a bad adjustment.The key theme of the novel and the movie has to do with the opposition of modern and conservative.  Austen wrote the novel as an argument against the social and moral excesses of Regency England.  Although it is not completely clear in the movie, you do get the idea that Fanny and Edmund represent old-fashioned virtues, while the Crawfords represent modern vices.  It all works pretty well.All in all, not a bad adaptation, and worth seeing.

She is promptly told to buzz off (in not those terms) but such an action would have been unthinkable in those times.I enjoyed watching this film and I was glad when all ended well (I knew it would from the very beginning) - the acting was wonderful, the scenery nice, and the characters were interesting even though I couldn't figure them out all of the time.

Fanny Price, although beautifully acted, is portrayed here as rebellious and headstrong when she was really a humble character, full of conviction; there's a big difference. Secondly, the movie sacrifices an accurate portrayal of 19th century England's culture for a statement too conformed to today's very different philosophies.

Controversial subject as it was, the film was not exploitative - simply showing the range of emotions how a woman felt in her unexpected self-discovery journey, initially reluctant and gradually succumbed to her inner true feelings.Here in Mansfield Park, though at times reminds me of the steady heroine in the 1995 Persuasion, we have Frances O'Connor (distinctly different personality portrayal from her 1997 Kiss or Kill Australian road movie) as the steadfast Fanny Price, and making this Jane Austen film very much her own. We follow her through her focused observations, interactions, inner reflections and restrained anguish; her joys and freeing moments of solitude have implied visual (typographic) poetry.  The upheld modesty and intellectual aura about her made her unique among her insensitive rich relatives but one beloved cousin and soul mate Edmund. In a way, the tale is that of a modern woman quite ahead of her times. It is costume drama with love a-mixing and matching, yet at Mansfield Park, times and people around Fanny eventually go through the rigors of change not unequal to what she's been through.Casting included a glamorous looking Embeth Davidtz as Mary Crawford, Alessandro Nivola as Henry Crawford, Jonny Lee Miller as Edmund (Jonny first appeared in the computer intensive 1995 Hackers with Angelina Jolie), and an impressive performance by young Hannah Taylor-Gordon who portrayed Fanny in her childhood days (Hannah did a remarkable job in 1999 Jakob the Liar opposite Robin Williams). I'm amazed at what this Canadian woman director can offer us - 1987 I've Heard the Mermaids Singing is one of her earlier films, which was quite different and imaginative from the mainstream movies at the time. Rozema is certainly not shy in delivering what she wanted to express and realize on the screen, even if it means taking liberty in the screenplay. If you're a true Jane Austen fan, you would not have missed the A&E 6-hour series 1995 Pride and Prejudice, with Colin Firth as a very convincing Mr. Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet - a perfect pair beyond the 1940 B&W film's Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier. You may also like the 13-part saga of 1978 Flambards, about an enduring and independent young woman and the various happenings on how she survived and matured in her life's journey - Christina McKenna's portrayal of Christina Parsons is one delightful heroine you'd want to persistently follow.

The basic plot is about young Fanny Price, growing up in a poor English household at the end of the 18th century.  Even as a young girl of maybe 9 or 10, when the movie opens, she displays a precocious literary skill for story telling. Fanny is sent to live with wealthy relatives, the Bertrams.  They make her very aware of their class differences which, they state, lead to her inferiority.  But as she grows up, she proves, while in her humility not at all trying to, that in fact she is very much their superior in terms of her intelligence, kindness, intuition about human nature, and practical sense.Fanny is almost too good to be true.  She is generous and sweet, and doesn't seem to resent the snobbery that she meets with at the Bertram estate.  Her writing blossoms, such as in a modest history of England that she pens and her letters home to her younger sister.  What a gem of a friend she'd be!Fanny is incredibly modest and unselfish, qualities which allow her to develop an intuition and objective sense about people.  She sees right through the phoniness and pretention of Henry Crawford, a high society friend of the Bertrams who courts Fanny.  Much to her credit, she rejects Henry's advances in a setting where women were not expected to have such strong opinions.  She holds the hope for romance with a Bertram cousin, Edmund, who is pursued by Henry's sister Mary.It was disturbing to watch the idle rich wile away their time in trivial pursuits, especially once we come to understand that the Bertram wealth is due to the labors of slaves in Antigua.  The slave issue is of course quite unsettling.  Other than a more explicit scene with drawings of the inhumanity of the Bertram patriarch toward his slaves, there is one scene that I found even more powerful and which still sends chills down my spine.  On Fanny's 100-mile carriage journey to her new home, they stop for a rest and she sees a large sailing ship in a harbor below, and hears wailing.  When she asks the porters, they say it's a slaver and the sounds are just the slaves being transported aboard.   I enjoyed the music with the closing credits; it sounded Elizabethan until a voice in some foreign language started to sing.  What language and genre is... aha!  It must be African (later verified in the credits) -- and it was a powerful and moving effect to combine the African singing with Elizabethan music.I loved the scenery and camera shots, such as of Fanny's carriage journey along seaside cliffs.  I very much enjoyed Fanny's reading of her lovely prose, and liked how the director had her character several times read directly into the camera, as if she were talking to us viewers.The romance is sweet and innocent. There is no foul language and, other than a quick modest glimpse of an extramarital affair and the very sad pictures of slave torture, really nothing offensive to keep a family from enjoying the film.  I don't, however, think that the pace of the film would appeal to teenagers, which I would characterize as dreamy and immersive.It's a simple and satisfying story.  Fanny is quite endearing and the unraveling of the story to me is a welcome respite from some contemporary films which seem to cater to a diminishing attention span.  It won't appeal to everybody, but if you enjoy films based on Jane Austen novels or movies like Room With a View, give Mansfield Park a try.  I'd give the film a 7 or 8 on a scale of 10.      --Dilip 1/16/2000 "},{"Title":"Twisted -- but enjoyable -- Austen","Date":"8 January 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  One of my biggest personal pet peeves about cinematic adaptations of novels is their infidelity to their original sources.

Director/screenwriter Patricia Rozema has mixed in some of Austen's letters and notebooks along with the book-text ; as a result, the central character of Fanny Price is more a reflection of Jane Austen than Jane Austen herself may have intended. -- With this previso aside, however, _Mansfield Park_ is well worth viewing.

In fact I have not seen an adaptation of Mansfield Park that I think captures the character of Fanny Price suitably. The 1983 version comes the closest to the book but that is more for the faithfulness to the story rather than the portrayal of Fanny. She may be one of the most difficult heroines to get right. I love the book for its amazing depth and complexity of themes, characters and socio-political statements. I love Fanny for the unusual representation of the feminine she portrays. She must have been unusual even at the time of writing for Jane says only she will love this heroine. Fast forward to today and Fanny's long-suffering, pious, sensitive nature is positively anti-feminist.The problem is that screenwriters take those characteristics and cast them to what we think of as pious and long-suffering. In the 1983 version, Fanny is stiff and self-righteous. The literary Fanny is graceful and elegant. Why else would Mr. Crawford find her compelling? We can't even imagine these days how this could go together and screenwriters dodge the issue by re-writing the character.This was taken to an extreme here with the writer choosing to use Jane Austen herself for Fanny rather than to bother tackling Fanny at all. This was also seen the the deplorable giggly wild thing Fanny in the 2007 version. I challenge a screenwriter to produce a version of this book reasonably faithful to the text and actually explores the tremendously complex character that is Fanny.A few words about the movie itself. There are a few gems that are in the book that I have not seen in other versions. For instance slavery is a part of the book, subtly wound into the subtext. Jane was an abolitionist. And I loved the line where Edmund says  Fanny, you really must begin to harden yourself to the idea of... being worth looking at. Fanny was beautiful, not stiff and thin-lipped.Overall this piece needs to be taken as an artistic rendering, not a literary adaptation. Then it is more enjoyable.

Those who say this film does not resemble the book at all, or has nothing to do with the book, or that Fanny Price is the complete opposite of the character in the book have in truth either never really read the story, or are engaging in extremely careless exaggerations.It is true that some mild liberties have been taken with this adaptation. The character of Fanny Price is not quite as meek and timid as she was in the book. But in this movie, neither is she portrayed as some kind of aggressive, assertive, anachronistic feminist. The few times where she is compelled to speak her mind are more than balanced by scenes in which she displays restrained sensitivity, or feels awkward, or defers to those who she deems superior to her in situation...just as the Fanny Price of the novel.Further, the few references to Sir Thomas' involvement in a slave trade are merely an interesting interpretation, and of such a minor nature, that they do not detract from the spirit of Jane Austen's storytelling. The reality is that that spirit has been kept intact. ALL the major characters and plot elements are still there, a challenge made difficult by the time restraints of a two hour film, and yet quite competently and impressively met. If one wishes to criticize a version that completely misses the mark on those two scores and very much deserves harsh criticism, it can be justifiably directed to the more recent and poorly-made BBC version starring Billie Piper.Some objections have been made to a more explicit depiction of the affair between Henry Crawford and Mariah. This was something Jane Austen decorously hinted at in her book but the full meaning of her intent was clear. The scene is extremely brief and not at all gratuitous nor explicit. If anything, it merely helps to emphasize the selfish betrayal of Henry and Mariah as they expose their families to scandal.The film is beautifully lit and shot, and the direction is quite often wonderfully subtle. The acting is excellent all around, but Frances O'Connor's subtle expressiveness in particular is a pleasure to watch. The music - described by one reviewer as loud and obnoxious (are you kidding me???) - is very charming chamber string music, more than appropriate to the tone and setting of the film.It may very well be impossible to satisfy some Jane Austen purists, but director Patricia Rozema and her crew deserve commendation for this enjoyable and intelligently made adaptation.

In doing so, I found it interesting, exciting, emotional, and dramatic.However, I also found it extremely shocking, including such scenes and characters that were so entirely different from any I had encountered in other Austen books (or, if you'll allow my bias, well-made adaptations). There are subjects touched on in this movie which I would think Austen would have stayed miles from, and I find it hard to believe that she wrote about such things, most prominently slavery and the mistreatment of slaves in America. With these assumptions, I looked on this film with a subtle crease in my brow.But it didn't take me long to put this all out of my mind and try to enjoy the movie for its individuality. Standing alone, without the assumption of Austen, it made me laugh and brought even a tear to my eye. I might even go so far as to say this movie is a breath of fresh air in regards to the taboo topics that it touches on, regardless of their lack of canon.So in the end, if you haven't read the book, you might just like this 'adaptation'.

The most disturbing liberty for me had to do with the relationship between Sir Thomas and Fanny upon his return from Antigua. In the book they had an amiable and very close relationship.

O'Connor was delightful as Fanny. I hope we see a lot more of her in the future. Equally good was Jonny Lee Miller as Edmund Bertram, who carries on a flirtatious romance with Fanny almost from her first arrival at Mansfield Park (the family estate.) Also offering strong performances were Embeth Davidtz and Allesandro Nivola as Mary and Henry Crawford, a brother and sister who also take up residence at Mansfield Park. Nivola does a good job as Henry, who simply can't understand why he can't convince Fanny to return the feelings he has for her. Davidtz has an impressive screen presence, and although this is never developed, and nothing improper ever happens, there are a couple of scenes in which there is some very powerful and yet innocent eroticism hinted at between Mary and Fanny, which makes you wonder just what goes on behind closed doors at Mansfield Park.In other words, I liked the movie. It had some problems, mind you. It creeps along a little bit and there are times when you wonder just where this movie wants to go, as the plot seems to meander here and there without establishing a strong direction. Still, it's a pleasant enough journey through early 19th century England, and does include some spectacular shots of the English countryside and seashore.

(possible spoiler)","Date":"5 April 2000","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  For too long, Jane Austen has languished in Gilbert and Sullivan-like respectability/ossification.  Adaptations of her work on British TV, immensely popular, ransack the author not for her fierce satire, her miraculous facility with language, her sheer cheek or her rarely flattering insights into human nature and society, but for the excuse they give to indulge in detailed costumes and big houses with pretty parks, features which naturally enough, are given scant attention in Austen's novels (which is why the best Austen adaptations have been modernisations such as METROPOLITAN and CLUELESS).Authenticity in Austen works, therefore, nowadays is judged by the excellence of such bourgeois whitewashing, the elegant ironing out of difficulty and danger.  Patricia Rozema's MANSFIELD PARK is mercifully, gleefully unauthentic.  For a start it is not a literary adaptation at all, but an adaptation of literary criticism of the novel (Edward Said in particular) - at two removes from the source material, Rozema has ample room for disrespect and truth.Further, she takes Austen's most joyless book unfortunately her best also, in that it contains her most astonishingly sustained writing), removes the reason for its dullness (the insufferably priggish Fanny Price), intersperses her heroine's narration with Austen's own journals and letters, breaks narrative convention in a whole host of ways, the most obvious of which is the heroine talking to camera.  By so taking apart the book, she makes the most faithful adaptation possible.  Not that it matters, but Rozema is right - Jane would have approved.All this playfulness, however, is double-edged.  The film opens, as with THE END OF THE AFFAIR and another masterpiece with which it shares many close affinities, LE TEMPS RETROUVE, with a montage of manuscripts.  Throughout the film, Fanny constantly writes letters, diaries, satires, stories. There is an elaborate sequence where Fanny is shown how to prepare her writing material.  Frequently, as does Catherine in 'Northanger Abbey', Fanny must defend novel-reading, and uses it, successfully, to both define her femaleness, and to judge people and life.And so the film works on two levels.  There is the world of the book, in which Fanny is not necessarily a prig, but quiet, druckened, as Harry Pendel might say, kept so down by social exclusion that whenever she does talk there is dismay and shock on the faces of her 'betters'.But when Fanny writes, no matter her material circumstances , stuck in a chilly, ex-governess' cavern, where she is denied even a fire, she is as free as a bird (a significant metaphor, which invokes and reworks its cliched associations), linked to her narration.  She reveals the world of Mansfield Park for what it is, an austere, brutal ruin, based on slavery, repression and the commodification of desire.She is witty, satiric and brave, she talks to us, shows US out of the early 19th century, what she can't show her peers; while the ballroom sequence, filmed with a grace that suspends time, magically choreographing her sexual awakening, is the most beautiful I've seen since THE LEOPARD.  Rozema frequently has her on edges, brinks, clifftops, or divides the screen into halves, suggesting both the precariousness of Fanny's position, and the sense of her emotional growth, moving from one state to another.Crucially, when the plot works against her, and she is banished from Mansfield Park, she stops writing and narrating, her parent's hovel is littered with crumpled paper that speaks nothing, while others write and speak for her, trying to decide her life.  The link between social power and who has the right to speak has never been more chillingly evoked - hence the emphasis on novel-reading and writing.  This makes the wonderful ending so unsubstantial; like Nabokov in 'Bend Sinister', Fanny reveals her puppet mastering (the film's poster has a giant Fanny looming over a tiny Mansfield Park holding a key), arranging happy endings for herself, unhappiness for her enemies, all with the flourish of her pen/voice, but hardly likely for the real Fanny Price.This metaphor has the effect of splitting Fanny in two, as well as the narrative, allowing Rozema to expose the society she is describing (and the unthinking collusion of latterday petticoat fetishists), the world of surface politeness (in one sequence we see characters dressing for a ball, putting on their public selves) and the real, truly nasty world.  The film is full of mirrors, windows, distorted reflections (in tarns etc.), undermining this society in the way Fanny's fantasy undermines her subject's so-called 'realism' (the surface of Mansfield Park reveals nothing, we need the horrifying art of Tom to reveal it to us).In many ways similar to Richardson's TOM JONES, what is most exciting about the film is that it does not take its cue from the society under scrutiny, fidelity to which makes so many 'classic' adaptations so stilted and sterile, but its extraordinary heroine, with its seemingly capricious shifts in tone, sprightly, often hand-held camerawork, a style laced with deceptive irony and yet emotionally devastating (the film is quite stunning in its representation of the place of  omen at the time, and much more sympathetic to 'aberrant' characters like Mariah than Fanny).The opening sequence is a stunning statement of intent, as young Fanny arrives at Mansfield Park.  A BBC drama would have played up the huge mansion and its grounds - Rozema shrouds it in darkness, decay and mystery, like a Gothic novel; Fanny's first encounter is with an unknown drunk.  The film ends, not with the usual Austen music flourish, but a bleak piece of African gospel called 'Slavery', refusing us the comfort of even a make-believe happy ending.All the actors are extraordinary, bursting out of the theatrical ghetto that is the bane of heritage drama - Harold Pinter is particularly magnificent and chilling, bearing the weight not only of his rank, but his whole rotten caste and country.  But it's Frances O'Conner's show, and she is an amazing find, managing to embody every emotion possible, while still retaining her powerful playfulness - she is Kate Winslet with irony if you like, an actress of genius.

I have read three of her books and have seen several film adaptations (including Clueless) and I don't see anything truly noteworthy about Austen's stories. A typical Austen story has three major elements.  1) The heroine is a young, beautiful whip, too smart for her own good.  2) The most perfect man in the world is in love with her and she can't see that.  And 3) She is limited by her social ranking, however her status is undergoing a turbulent period.  Austen's novels are pure soap opera.  All this talk of beautiful people running around beautiful mansions in beautiful corsets is just not believable.  So why then, do I fall for it every single time?This is the story of a young girl, Fanny Price, who's mother married down the social ladder.  As a result they live in peasant class housing, defineately on the wrong side of the tracks.  As a teenager, Fanny (played by Francis O'Conner) is sent to live with her mothers family in the gorgeous mansion called Mansfield Park.  There she is constantly reminder of her of where she came from.  Two of her cousins are giggling 'man catchers' who are bewildered by the fact that Fanny is not as well educated as they are.  An aunt who obviously sees the potential of Fanny, tries to keep her at bay, using subtle hints if she sees Fanny getting out of line.  But, like most Austen leads, Fanny does not sulk about it too much.  She puts her best foot forward, rolls with the punches and waits patiently for her opportunity to shine.  Fanny does shine in the eyes of her other cousin, Edmund (played to the pouty hilt by Johnny Lee Miller).  They form a deep bond early on in the film, and of course, just like all of Austen's stories, their obvious love for each other is kept restrained.  (Anyone into bondage would love Jane Austen.)Soon the story gets more complicated with the arrival of another suitor.  Henry Crawford is a wealthy little pervert, defineately good looking, as well as hot to trot.  He dismisses the other women of his rank in an effort to win over Fanny.  Of course, true to most Austen characters, Fanny isn't too sure about his proposal, because she isn't quite sure she can trust him.I was pleasantly surprised to see that Patricia Rozema was directing this effort.  Her previous work on such classic art-flicks as I've Heard the Mermaids Singing and White Room, demonstrate her unique directing abilities.  She comes through with Mansfield Park as well. Many of todays period dramas attempt to bring a story up to date by offering tawdry sex.  Rozema keeps that repressed theme that is so evident in Austen's work, and instead focuses on the absurdities (at least in our eyes) of the staunch moral and ethical dilemas of that era. What Rozema crafts is an intelligent, humorous and original film, true to the Austen form, but still unique in its own way.  The acting is good and the direction is first rate.  The smoldering sexual tension between these beautiful young actors, along side the cold and mannered social practices of the day make this an entertaining film to watch.

The heroine here is perhaps even a bit like Austen&#x97;though the actress is prettier, by all accounts&#x97;and it includes letters read by the character that are seemingly Austen's words. But what the cast and director Patricia Rozema pull off here is fabulous. There is no one reason this movie works so well, except of course the really scintillating, funny writing of Austen herself. The lead character is Fanny Price, played with true joy, angst, and subtle wit by Frances O'Connor. The two men who court her on and off are strong enough as men to be convincing, but they are perfectly still young men, barely more than boys in years, and they have those youthful flaws. Which is part of the fodder for Austen's wit.And social observation. If you don't quite catch the way she plays social classes against each other you miss part of the substance. It isn't just that the poor niece ends up at the rich uncle's house, but that this same niece has the perception to see through their facades. And to keep mum until just the right moment.This isn't a liberation film where the woman charges to victory in a big speech or by a power play. Instead&#x97;and this is one reason Austen is still readable today&#x97;the woman simply comments on the issues in a way that makes clear her more advanced views, and the obstacles slowly fall away through outside circumstances (rather than her own doing). The passivity of Fanny Price might bother some people, but that's exactly her role, as a character, in this pageant.One last point&#x97;slavery. This is the one novel of Austen's that gets her in trouble for her languid views on the uncle's use of slaves in the West Indies. The movie seems to twist this into a more modern condemnation, which helps us stay sympathetic to the whole shebang. There is even an added scene of sketches (done in a way rather like Goya's socially critical drawings of the same time, with some Kara Walker thrown in) which make clear the crisis at hand.If you want to dip into Austen through a movie, choose between this and the 2005 Pride and Prejudice and you won't be disappointed. Of course, if you want to read the book&#x97;that's even better. More modern and fresh than it should be for 200 years ago.

But unlike any of the previous contemporary film versions (Sense and Sensibility, Persuasion, Emma, etc.), Mansfield Park has both a fierce awareness of where the wealth on display in the film comes from, and the moral implications of these facts for her drama.  This is the only film from this period to contextualize the emotional lives of its characters with issues like slavery and genuine poverty.One of the best lines in the film comes Fanny returns home from Mansfield Park to her desperately poor family because she does not love the man who has proposed to her.  Her mother sneaks into her bedroom late one night and tells her, Remember, dear.  I married for love.  It's the kind of moment that none of the other Austen adaptations would have known what to do with. But it is part of this film's subversive humor and trenchant social critique, and it gets the biggest laugh from the audience.The film's deft handling of the issue of slavery is also noteworthy. Austen's characters make much more sense given the full social context in which they lived.  Harold Pinter, the playwright, is powerful and terrifying in the role of Sir Thomas, the patriarch of Mansfield Park.  The confrontations between him and Fanny are truly mesmerizing.This is a great and powerful film, made with intelligence and moral sophistication.  It's also wickedly funny.  A great piece of entertainment for the heart and mind.

Yes, yes I know that it's not faithful to the book, but I do believe they readily admitted to taking inspiration from other Austen works as well as the author herself. I in fact read, or tried to read, the book and found it dull and uninspiring, unlike other Austen novels. For these reasons, I don't have any objections on that score.What I do find regrettable is the insistence on trying to make the story modern and wicked. Firstly, Jane Austen's works have always stood the test of time without trying to modernize them. I find Pride and Prejudice more relevant than many movies based on novels written 10 years ago. And secondly, the charm of Jane Austen is that her characters are in no way wicked! They have faults abundantly, but the heroines and heroes are undoubtedly good. They are not sleazy. I hate to think that being naughty is the equivalent of being modern. Or that every story that mentions slavery must make a big deal about how horrible it was and good people will instinctively realize that and will stand against it. We all know slavery was bad, but it was a way of life for a very long time and believe it or not, not every good person was an abolitionist. All this to say that the forced modernity jars very unsettlingly with the characteristics anyone who is familiar with history knows and expects to see.Buuut despite the rant, I was altogether pleased. I felt the changes in Fanny were an improvement and though she felt inconsistent, I could understand where waverings in her personality came from. I think many mistake her steadfast loyalty to Edmund for smugness and prudery, and truthfully I might not like her if I had to live with her in person, but I felt for her on screen. The rest of the cast did very well, though Mary was too much vixen, even making insinuations with Fanny.It was very interesting at the end where Fanny states it all could have ended very differently, but it didn't. I definitely saw that as I was rooting for Henry most of the time. I do truly feel if he had shown more patience or Fanny had accepted him, they may have grown to love each other and things could have still ended happily. But Austen seems intent on having that one deceitful man in all her stories Wickham, Willoughby, Frank, Henry...Ah well, all in all a good film. One of the more melancholy of the Austens, alongside Sense and Sensibility- when things get dark, they get DARK. But don't worry, the sun will shine again, as suns are wont to do...

For the record I am a passionate fan of the novels, and thought the recent Keira Knightley Pride and Prejudice too silly and modernized. The ads and previews for Mansfield Park on its theatrical release made it seem like a revisionist, sexed-up bit of trash, so I skipped it. What wasn't stressed then, and makes watching the DVD worthwhile, is that it is revisionist in a very thoughtful, interesting way. Note that the movie claims to be based on both Mansfield Park AND Jane Austen's journals and other writings. It never claims to be a straight filming of the novel. Fortunately it is beautifully made and has integrity in being faithful both to aspects of the book and to the writer/director's interpretation of it. It earns the liberties it takes with the novel.No, this is not Jane Austen's Fanny Price. Fanny has been re-imagined as Jane Austen herself, a woman of intelligence and talent for whom ideas and writing are essential to life. The wild stories we hear Fanny reading to her sister are passages from Austen's Juvenilia, and we also hear passages from Austen's journals and other writings. I've never been a Fanny-hater myself, but I did love this new Fanny. I was surprised at the absence of Fanny's brother, but the writer/director (Patricia Rozema) has combined William with Susan for the sake of economy. As she explains in the commentary track, she retained Susan instead of William since Susan's character has a conclusion, as it were.The abolitionist theme that is very subtle in the book is played up here. Not with preachy monologues and 21st century anachronisms, but by dialogue and events that come naturally from the characters. There have always been abolitionists. Other, more overt motifs in the novel, such as improvements and acting, do not get much screen time. Changes are also made in chronology, and there is a brief caught in flagrante sex scene that doesn't deserve the scorn heaped upon it.What emerges in this movie is a great, vibrant heroine, the hybrid Austen/Fanny character. Austen's journal writings are haunting, echoing and summarizing many of the themes of her best characters and fiction. Frances O' Connor gives a fantastic performance as the adult Fanny, supported by as fine an ensemble cast as I've ever seen. The movie has a wonderful score, and looks just right. Deliberately not as opulent as some adaptations, this film makes the signs of decay around the house of Mansfield Park subtle but unmistakable.This version of Mansfield Park is not a straight depiction of the novel, and the adaptation won't be to everyone's taste. Patricia Rozema does know Austen's work, but as a filmmaker realizes that you can't just transfer great prose onto a screen. She made choices as to which themes to bring out and which to ignore, and made changes in character and dialogue to give the movie a life of its own. These choices were made for artistic reasons, not out of ignorance of Austen. You could ask, Why not just write an original screenplay if you're going to change so much? I think it's because Rozema and we love Austen, and Austen is still at the heart of this film, just beating a different rhythm.

Her mother married for love. She was sent to live with her aunt's family the Bertrams in Mansfield Park at the age of 10. She's looked down upon by everybody except the son Edmund (Jonny Lee Miller). Sir Thomas travels to their Antigua plantation with the oldest son Tom. The rest of the family is joined in Mansfield by Henry (Alessandro Nivola) and his sister Mary Crawford (Embeth Davidtz). Edmund becomes infatuated with Mary. The Bertram sisters Maria and Julia both vie for Henry despite the fact that Maria is already engaged to the dull Rushworth.This movie takes slavery on as a central theme. Also Fanny Price is a thoroughly modern woman as well-read head-strong thinking woman. Her abolitionist views are ahead of her times. This adds something much more than the usual Jane Austen interior romanticism. I'm sure some Austen fans hate a lot of the changes but it works for me. It adds a higher moral idealism to the romance.

It's interesting to see how so many of the cast members have become successful on television since James Purefoy in the Following, Johnny Lee Miller in Elementary and High Bonneville in Downton Abbey. Francis O'Connor isn't as pretty an actress as I would have liked to fill the role but she acts well.For modern audiences, Mansfield Park will never be widely embraced as Sense and Sensibility, and Pride and Prejudice because one has to accept a great love between first cousins. It's a shame this dated aspect stops it from being more well loved because the story is interesting and deals with adultery and divorce which is quite daring for the time. Also the Crawfords are among Austen characters some of the more interesting flawed characters. They are well played by Embeth Davitz and Alessandro Nivola.There are some differences from the novel that have been criticised in this version. Some relocations of events and reducing of characters I understand is necessary for brevity. The slavery issue is played up to make things more modern.Overall it's still a well made and attractive adaptation that doesn't have that cheap television feel of some other productions.

I found Fanny boring, and to me Edmund truly seemed to treat her like a sister in the book, and I remember thinking that if I were him I wouldn't have romantic feelings for such an insipid person either (to be honest, he was pretty dull himself). Because of my lack of love for the book, I'd never seen any adaptations of Mansfield Park, and was specially glad to stay away from this one, so hated by my fellow Austen fans.I decided to see it this week for truly shallow reasons I discovered Jonny Lee Miller was in it, and I think he's really hot, especially in this phase of his life (great actor also). So I watched it, and surprisingly, really liked it! I completely understand why fans of the book hate it, if one of the other five Austen books were changed to this extent I would have a fit. Fanny is a completely different character, though a much more interesting one in my opinion. The outrage fans showed over the slavery storyline is specially understandable, it's such a jarring storyline to insert, not to mention it makes Fanny into such a Mary Sue in her I'm ahead of my contemporaries in understanding that slavery &#x96; which has nothing to do with the actual book &#x96; is bad mindset. Also, yes, Frances O'Connor is much too old to play Fanny.Perhaps because I was already well aware of these shortcomings, I let myself enjoy the movie without nitpicking. I found this Fanny a truly engaging character, and for the first time I found myself cheering for her and Edmund (in the book I couldn't care less about her love for him, and the only reason I wasn't surprised he returned her affections in the end is because it's an Austen book and I knew the heroine would get her happy ending). This was because both actors gave much more energetic performances than were to be expected if the script followed the book more closely, IMO.In summary not for fans of the book, completely understand their opinion, but I still liked it. And my crush on Jonny Lee Miller has increased tenfold!

Effort could have gone into capturing the spirit of Fanny's character from the book, however her character here is pretty much the opposite of her novelistic counterpart, rebellious in alternative to shy and thoughtful. Frances O'Connor is alluring and manages not to be too forced in her acting, but this is not the Fanny I know and love. The other characters are rather dull and devoid of the personalities that made them so compelling in the book. The pace can be sluggish at times and the music is repetitive and over-bearing, while the writing is stilted and takes you out the era and the story is muddled and because of omissions like the Grants there is not enough of the themes here that shaped the original story so well.

However, I was quickly annoyed by the disgraceful attack on our Queen Elizabeth I. I can only assume the scriptwriter is descended from a disgruntled Scots emigrant and doesn't know the truth. Whilst the view of our great Queen as a brutal persecutor of Mary Queen of Scots may delight some disgruntled Scots, it is totally inaccurate. Mary was a foolish woman although also in a difficult situation as she was a staunch Catholic in a country that had turned mostly Protestant. After her third very stupid marriage failed and she was on the run from her own nobles who had no respect for her - which is significant - she hoped England would give her protection. Yet at the same time she continued to insist obsessively that she was Queen of England and plot and scheme to do away with her Protector Queen Elizabeth. Unfortunately for her, the usual rule of winner takes all applied. She had to be imprisoned as she was encouraging sedition. Elizabeth should have had her executed long before she actually did after enduring many years of Mary's interminable plotting against Elizabeth's life, but Elizabeth held to the view that a Monarch should not be dishonoured. It is a pity her cousin Mary of Scots didn't have the decency to honour Elizabeth similarly. Mary didn't it seems care about the fact that England had had an appalling experience under the brief but manic rule of Catholic fanatic Mary I who introduced the vicious Spanish Inquisition with horrendous results into England. Thank heaven she didn't last long. The Inquisition is totally alien to English ways. There was no way England would stand for another Catholic ruler either - which is partly why later James II later was slung out, and rightly. There is no way Fanny - or Jane Austen - would insult Queen Elizabeth as in this movie. I must assume the movie isn't British or the scriptwriter would know better.The Slave Trade... Jane Austen did not get into politics. Fanny wouldn't have dared to criticise. Tom is a selfish arrogant drunkard and I don't remember him ever complaining about slavery. Did he? Fanny was quiet and careful not to offend and very well aware of her lowly status. Her Aunt Sir Thomas's wife was very fond of Fanny though imposed greatly on her - why isn't this bond shown? Fanny and Edmund were rather insufferable prigs by our modern standards but not by theirs. This movie's Fanny is far too feisty by far.If the scriptwriter hadn't chosen to get into politics and smear England's great Queen, this movie would have gained 8 stars from me. I don't mind a loose adaptation, but do get the facts right. If the story had been written by a Scot resentful of the treatment of their Catholic Queen Mary and about Scots of the time who might have been equally annoyed, the view of Mary and Elizabeth it expressed would have made sense.

Her mother, a sister of a wealthy English landowner and merchant, married for love and, ended up, poor and in charge of an ever growing family. One day, Fanny is sent on a visit to the wealthy uncle's mansion, Mansfield Park. In her early teens, Fanny thinks she is going for a short stay, only. Much to her great discomfort and sadness, she finds her mother has given her to the relatives to raise. Moreover, her relatives do not treat her as a loving niece but, instead, decide to give her a status somewhat higher than a servant but lower than themselves. In this horrid atmosphere, Fanny's only friend is her kind cousin, Edmund. As she grows in beauty and intelligence, Fanny becomes a keen observer and, indeed, writer of the escapades of her relatives. Her family, after all, has a drunken aunt, a mentally disturbed male cousin, a golddigging female cousin, and more. Also, new to the neighborhood, is a brother and sister, who are also doing their share of scheming and social climbing. But, will Fanny be able to follow her heart in the midst of the chaos? This is a somber Austen, much more so than Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility. Fanny's relatives are, for the most part, pretty awful folks and her survival amongst them is not a pretty picture. Nevertheless, O'Connor is wonderful as the young lady who uses her own smarts and determination to rise above her circumstances. The rest of the cast is also quite good, with one possible exception. Jason Lee Miller, who plays the adult Edmund, is a bit lacking, in my estimation, in the qualities needed for the principal male hearthrob. How unfortunate. The costumes, settings, production, script, and direction, however, are all top of the line. Any Austen fan will not want to miss this one, for any reason. But, even if Austen has never been your cup to tea, sit down and take in Mansfield Park. It is a fine, fine movie.

It had virtually nothing to do with Austen's book, which I happen to think is the most densely structured and interesting of her books. But the film brilliantly shows us the difficulties of adapting the past to the all conquering present.Let's say Rozema detested Austen's book, and didn't want her film to convey Austen's message effectively. Fair enough. I think Austen is a conservative and a snob, and I can sympathize with someone who wants to subvert all that. But look what happens when a fairly (I assume) illiterate filmmaker tries to rewrite Austen. First off, the tension between Fanny and Sir Thomas disappears. Instead of being a stiff but nevertheless very moral older man, he is made into a brutal lech, and a debaucher of slaves. All this unnecessary political correctness makes it ridiculous that Fanny should worry about his disapproval. Austen's Fanny wouldn't have stayed three minutes with this Sir Thomas Bertram. And what was the point of making Fanny a feisty modern feminist in relation to Mrs Norris? Again, a feisty modern feminist would have been turned out of the Park by Austen's Mrs Norris in no time at all. So Rozema's anachronistic attribution of spirit to Fanny ruins the careful structure of the book, in which fanny's Christian patience and humility wins over everyone she comes into contact with.But I thought the film was fascinating, because it reveals a huge problem that filmmakers, especially, face. How can you be true to the spirit of the original, and yet signal that you disapprove of the spirit? Rozema's choice was to simply rewrite Austen, which is probably the silliest option. But I have to admit that a brilliant film version of MP would probably be a flop. We simply aren't willing to accept Austen's message, which is about Christian fortitude and patience, not to mention resisting sexual desire.

I never finished the book, and decided never to touch anything by Austen again. A few days ago, I came across Mansfield Park on the shelves at my local video rental store, since I was just browsing and happened to have my membership card and a few bucks in my pocket, I decided why not, so I rented it. When I popped it in my VCR, I was pleasantly surprised. While I'd agree that the bit about slavery is extraneous, there's no need to dwell on minor points, as they occupy a tiny fraction of screen time. I loved O'Conner's portrayal of Fanny, and for the longest time I thought she's going to marry Henry Crawford and live happily ever after. I completely missed the bit about his flirtation with Mariah and I guess it was so minor that I just automatically dismissed it as not being central to the plot. I'd have never thought the Crawfords to be such as they really are. I really enjoyed the incorporation of the bits of stories that Fanny wrote, ...their intimicy grew to such a pitch that they no longer kick each other out of the window at the slightest provocation, ...but lived beyond their means and eventually was jailed where she was partially eaten by her two young sons, but she plans to stab the prison guards... I loved these tidbits as they really give an insight to the creative and imaginative mind of Fanny Price. What made the whole movie work is O'Conner's portrayal of Fanny, if they have made Fanny timid and shy and submissive as had been suggested, I think the movie would've been boring and turned me off Austen forever (now I'm going to find P&P and S&S to watch). This Fanny is actually exciting, to quote Edmund, her entire person is entirely agreeable. There are lots of movies with hot actresses, and there's lots of movies with sappy teen romances, what set this movie apart is that it's romantic without being sappy, it's fun without being frivolous, and the heroine isn't some boy crazy school girl or butt kicking action junkie, she actually possesses wit and humor, with capabilities for invention and creativity. In other words, she actually has a brain and a heart of course -) .

They are seen as  cavalcades of pretty costumes and good manners, a sort of filmic wing of Good Housekeeping. Austen's insight into human behaviour, her dextrous use of language and her keen satire of the mores of love, wealth and marriage are all too often ignored. As well as being (loosely) adapted from the novel Mansfield Park, the script is based on Austen's early journals and letters. It might be better to call this Patricia Rozema's (the director) Mansfield Park, rather than Austen's.This has been portrayed in the mass media as punk Jane Austen with lesbianism, sex, slavery and other assorted liberties taken. As usual the coverage of these aspects is out of proportion. The lesbianism amounts to a couple of mildly flirtatious moments; although slavery is a key theme in this adaptation. Modern critics, such as Edward Said, make much of the references to an Antiguan slave plantation in the novel; far more than Jane Austen does. Rozema makes the moral issue - how can these people live a life of ease with the profits of slavery - central to the movie.Fanny Price (Frances O'Connor) lives in poverty in Portsmouth until sent to live with her Aunt's family in Mansfield Park. The family is led by Sir Thomas Bertram (Harold Pinter) the alternately affable and stern patriarch; his alcoholic wife (Lindsay Duncan, who also appears as Fanny's mother); Mrs Norris, Fanny's aunt, who is a petty dictator; the youngest son of Sir Thomas, the serious Edmund (Johnny Lee Miller); Sir Thomas' two silly daughters; and Tom the eldest son, who in the original book was merely a libertine but here is not only a libertine but an anti-slavery libertine (content though to squander the proceeds of slavery)Into all this come Henry Crawford (Alessandro Nivola) and his sister Mary Crawford (Embeth Davidtz); attractive, unconventional and ultimately amoral, and the agents that send most of the action in motion. Fanny acts as the catalyst for the moral regeneration of the family. Her patience, kindness, and intelligence shine through at all times.Naturally enough, while other characters constantly remind us of Fanny Price's undesirability (mainly due to her lack of family name and money), Frances O'Connor is a babe who would stop traffic in real life. This Fanny Price is far more assertive and acerbic than Austen's. As is the way with the movies, the action is less subtle than in the novel; what Austen leaves unspoken, or doesn't deal with, is made explicit. The acting is superb, especially Harold Pinter, holding up very well for a man who'll be seventy in October.The last music we hear over the end credits is an African song called Slavery. We are a long way from the pretty frocks of stereotypical costume drama. Occasionally  the political and sexual subtexts are a little forced. One character exclaims this is 1806 for Heaven's sake which is the early 21st Century talking. Overall though there is much to enjoy in this thought-provoking film that catches the spirit if not perhaps the letter of Austen's works.

Rozema puts a feminist spin on Austen's text, which is not necessarily true to the book Austen herself was quite a conservative. The film is also more of a romance than the book; which could mainly be due to the expectations of a modern audience. Fanny Price is, in the book, a difficult character to sympathise with, and the ending, although presented happily is suitably occluded. Fanny IS marrying her Cousin. Mansfield Park is essentially a tale of obeisance to society. The Be rtram sisters break society's rules and are punished. Fanny, by marrying Edmund, is dutifully maintaining the fabric of society - which Austen herself held to be so important - and is duly rewarded. A well studied and argued piece of film-making, even if it does twist Austen's text somewhat to meet its feminist agenda.

After a screening, I walked out with the feeling there was much to think over.  Now, after reading several reviews and doing much careful reflection, I believe the main achievement of the movie is the elaboration and foregrounding of certain aspects of the circumambient reality of regency England. Ms. Rozema's intersection of Austen's own world with the world of her novel creates the effect of a momentous alteration.The crucial question is how the original story is altered.  It is the moral dimension of the novel that gains amplitude in Ms. Rozema's rerendering. Through the notable changes in the characters of Sir Thomas Bertram, Thomas, Jr. and Henry and Mary Crawford, the story acquires the angry tone of a forthright and broad-based social indictment.  Near the end, Sir Thomas is bowed if not broken by his complicity in patriarchal, imperialist, slave-mongering England.  Thomas, Jr. is nearly driven to suicide by his extended, pious rant against all that his father embodies.  Henry Crawford (and Maria Rushworth) are imprisoned within the arrogance of abused privilege.  Mary Crawford succumbs to a vulgar ambition which finally becomes cancerous.  It's as if the laughing, witty spirit of Jane Austen, peerless moral intellect who nonetheless remains in balance with the humorist were suddenly bum-rushed by a stern, didactic reformer.  Although it's easy to rationalize that Ms. Rozema, who writes in today's climate of post-censorship, projects a more commendable moral fervor because she's free to make explicit what the repressed culture of Jane Austen could only whisper, one suspects that Jane Austen, in writing about her own country and society, projects her muted morality through a tender affection and loving toleration wholly absent from her Canadian interpreter.  On the question of rebuke vs. toleration, in application to moral values, Ms. Rozema clearly holds the higher ground.But there is another application, namely, aesthetic.  Although the impact of aesthetics upon morality remains a vexed question, its impact upon the vitality of art is fundamental.  The enduring beauty of Jane Austen's writing lies within its coupling of human nature astutely observed with a generous and supremely tensile sympathy.  In her genius for characterization, a genius that defies moral pigeonholing, Jane Austen finds no counterpart in Ms. Rozema.I don't quibble when I point out that Fanny's removal to Mansfield Park is due not to Lady Bertram, as one might expect, but rather to Fanny's other aunt, Mrs. Norris.  Early on, we see Mrs. Norris, a mean-spirited, pretentious attachment to the Bertram estate, express shock upon hearing Sir Thomas' assumption that Fanny will move into her and Mr. Norris' cottage. Her idea in bringing Fanny was to have her live (albeit as a virtual servant) in the big house.  While it might be argued that Mrs. Norris merely likes to strike a generous pose while spending the largesse of another, her role as catalyst blocks her absolute dismissal as a petty tyrant.The most telling changes occur within the character of Mary Crawford.  In the original, as in the rerendering, there is a pivotal scene where Edmund's eyes are opened to the strong worldliness and deficient piety of Miss Crawford's character.  But she never disgraces herself as a heartless vulgarian.  Ms. Rozema's Mary Crawford is an unambiguous villain who merely has to announce herself in order to permanently repel anyone possessing common sense.  In the original, Mary Crawford is an attractive woman possessing sparkling wit, excellent judgment and uncommon good sense.  It is only through the exercise of his highest discernment, which he acknowledges to have been honed to sharpness by Fanny, that Edmund sees that Miss Crawford's charms are evanescent.  Even then, it's primarily personal feeling, not indignation, that guides Edmund's choice. There has even been some argument, among professional critics, whether nor not within Jane Austen, in the creation of Mary Crawford, the artist outmaneuvers the moralist.

Those who profess to be experts about such things say that this early work was not one of her best.  However, I found the film to be delightful and very much in keeping with Austen's penchant for conjuring up romantic intrigue in 19th century English society.This is the story of Fanny Price (Frances O'Connor), who is taken out of poverty by her aunt and benefactress to live in high society.  Though she is given every benefit afforded her cousins, she is constantly reminded of her second-class status in the household.  As the story revs up, we are treated to a typical Austen maelstrom of misplaced romantic affections.  Mariah Bertram (Victoria Hamilton) is engaged to Mr. Rushworth (Hugh Bonneville), but she is infatuated with Henry Crawford (Allesandro Nivola) as is her sister Julia.  Though Henry enjoys flirting with Mariah, his true affections lie with Fanny.  Fanny shuns his attentions because she loves her cousin Edmund (Jonny Lee Miller) who is smitten by Henry's sister Mary (Embeth Davitz).  This is a classically delicious Austenian romantic conundrum.  The remainder of the story goes about reconciling all the unrequited love with more than a few interesting twists.Patricia Rozema adapted and directed this film, which was very nicely done.  The choice of locations was excellent and she used the countryside effectively, giving us numerous lovely outdoor scenes.  The period rendering was very good as well, presenting very realistic 19th century sets and costumes.  There has been a lot of controversy about Rozema's insertion of the slave issue, which was notably absent from Austen's novel.  To a point, I have to defend Rozema, but ultimately I felt she went too far. A director has a responsibility to make the film believable by providing details not in the script.  For instance, Austen doesn't specifically describe the actual dress and furniture of the time, so the director must find suitable props and costumes of the period to give the film a genuine look and feel.  Slavery was a dominant issue of the time and so the insertion of the topic was a realistic detail, as long as it remained in the background.  However, the introduction of the sketch pad (those who have seen the film will understand) took slavery out of the background and made it a plot element.  This was tantamount to rewriting Austen's story, and I felt it was a preachy and presumptuous abuse of artistic license.Frances O'Connor was outstanding as Fanny.  She was enchanting and effervescent and passed credibly for a teenager despite being almost 30 years old.  Fanny was a multifaceted character.  She was a combination of youthful ebullience, fierce independence and stubborn determination.  O'Connor handled all these aspects of her character like a pro.  Embeth Davitz was also excellent as Henry's conniving sister.This delightful and well-crafted film is very entertaining and enjoyable.  I rated it 9/10.  With the possible exception of the slavery issue, lovers of Jane Austen will not be disappointed.

Yet, here is the latest, a film version of what many consider to be one of her weaker efforts, `Mansfield Park,' a tale set, like all her stories, in the pleasant countryside of early 19th Century England.  Faced as they were with the obvious inferiority of the source material and the prospect of building a film around what is universally admitted to be one of Austen's drabbest heroines, the filmmakers obviously decided to risk updating the material by bringing a more modern, socially conscious sensibility to the proceedings.  Predictably, many Austen purists have balked at the screenwriter's injection of so sanguinary a subject as the slave trade into the author's carefully isolated and circumscribed world of genteel manners and quaint social customs.  In addition, the film even provides a glimpse of passionate lovemaking that, while insignificant by today's filmic standards, may well jolt the true Austenphile into a state of palpitating agitation if not downright apoplexy (pass the smelling salts someone; I feel a case of the vapors coming on)!Actually, `Mansfield Park' emerges as a reasonably entertaining film, true to the spirit of Austen in its sharp-witted dialogue and its exploration of ever-shifting romantic relationships that are the staples of all the author's works.  The protagonist, Fanny Price, sent off at a young age to live as the `poor relation' at her relatives' estate in the country, has been made less the passive observer she was in the novel and more a woman of action and decision.  The film essentially concerns itself with the romantic travails of this kindhearted, clear-eyed young woman as she copes with the haughtiness, facades and deceptions of a number of the people around her.  Even though the story seems at times a pale reiteration of themes and plot devices developed to more effectiveness in the author's `Pride and Prejudice,' the complexity of both the characters and the storyline keep one intrigued for most of the film's running time.  As with Elizabeth Bennet, Fanny discovers the realities of the true persona so often hidden beneath deceptively simple surfaces and learns to accept a world and the people living in that may not be quite in accordance with one's stubbornly held pre-conceived notions. As to the inclusion of the issue of the uncle's involvement in the slave trade, it is not, in and of itself, a matter for immediate dismissal.  Just because Austen never included it in any of her works doesn't mean that it is necessarily irrelevant in helping to fill in the social background of the era presented.  The problem, though, is that the subject is dealt with in such a superficial manner that it seems tacked on as a too-obvious attempt to render the time period more in tune with modern standards of equanimity and social justice &#150; as if our liberal consciences could not indulge themselves guilt-free in the seeming triviality of these characters' over-sheltered lives if we were not forced to notice that such a lifestyle was possible only on the broken backs of human workhorses.  (One wonders if, in a film set in modern times, we will now be subjected to discussions of the cruelty and inhumanity of the treatment of migrant farm workers every time a character indulges himself in a piece of fruit.  It is always so much easier to point the finger of wagging shame at the barbarity of cultures long passed from the scene than at our own).Luckily, writer/director Patricia Rozema has been blessed with a first-rate cast of extraordinary actors, including Embeth Davidtz as a fully fleshed-out version of Fanny, and even playwright Harold Pinter, of all people, as Fanny's slave-owning uncle.  Visually, the film is gorgeous, capturing the many-hued brilliance of the tranquil English countryside and the dreary, somber grayness of Fanny's impoverished seaside home with equal effectiveness.`Mansfield Park' is nowhere near the sparkling delight that `Emma' was.  Still, it provides riches aplenty for those with a fondness for this time period and the uniquely special joys Jane Austen's works provide.

Out of the even more famous mind of social chronicler Jane Austen (Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility) comes Mansfield Park, a product of the transition from romantic to Victorian England, specifically set in the first few years of the nineteenth century.The film version of the novel directed by Patricia Rozema (I've Heard the Mermaids Singing) thrives on taking a feminist view of men's limitations and a good woman's faith in true love as the only arbiter of a successful marriage.Rozema depicts the rise of Fanny Price, poor ten-year old cousin to the rich Sir Thomas Bertram family, to trusted family member and eventual wife to Sir Thomas's cleric son. The elements of class rigidity and social climbing, carried throughout the century to Anthony Trollope's Barsetshire novels, are all there A young woman must marry well by whatever means at hand but suffer severe loss should arrangements not go as planned. That a poor young woman fights every moment for dignity and a chance at happiness is expressed in Sir Thomas's advice to his daughters about cousin Fanny She is not your equal. But that must never be apparent to her. The moneyed men rarely suffer serious consequences in this culture war, a source of justifiably unending feminist scorn. That women could not inherit under English law placed the whole circus in perspective for a father like Sir Thomas with sons to receive his wealth and daughters and nieces to negotiate into marriage. His exchange with Fanny over marrying the unworthy but well-off Henry Crawford crystallizes Sir Henry's narrow thinking and Fanny's struggle in this exchange Do you trust me?'' he asks. ''Yes, sir.'' ''Well, I trust him, and you will marry him.'' Although we are used to the usually careful Miramax renditions (The nineties are filled with masterpieces), Rozema innovates by adapting Austen's journals, letters, and 1814 novel to the director's vision. In effect, Rozema creates a leaner version of the novel with a heroine less somber and more literary, a character even closer in temperament and talent to Jane Austen than the author herself created. Purists need not be offended The resulting film is every bit Austen's world of maneuvering misses and manipulated males, all of whom seem to share the goal of marrying well and preserving fortunes.Rozema's sub-theme about slavery and abolitionism is highlighted by a sketchpad of slave horrors and comments about the Bertrams' good life being supported by their Antigua plantation. It's a nice touch to have Sir Thomas forsake slavery in the end only to turn to tobacco as his next investment. The modern sensibility catches the irony, Rozema succeeds in updating Austen, and Fanny finds her soul mate. Pretty neat for a hefty novel written 200 years ago.And by the way, if feminism and nineteenth-century social climbing are not interesting to you, at least see the film for its superior cinematography&#151;those helicopter shots the director admits to loving almost to obsession are another of the delights to connect the post- modern Seinfeld and Friends world to the romantic early Victorians.

Her cousin, Edmund, (Jonny Lee Miller) is her closest friend and only ally in a household that treats her like a servant, instead of an equal member of the family. The 'action' begins in the movie when Mary and Henry Crawford arrive at Mansfield and change everything and everyone. The best part is noticing how and why, because some things are so subtle, it took many viewings and the commentary on the DVD to fully appreciate.The movie right on, and couldn't have followed the book more closely, without compromising writer/director Patricia Rozema's attempts to include Jane Austen (not just her book) into the film, as well. The stories Fanny tells are actually from Austen's early works and journals and other bits from her other works were put in as well, that Austen fans can pick out and appreciate.The movie has a modern feel to it, with underlying references to slavery and a deeper relationship between Fanny and Mary. The mood is fresh and though the story from a different time, it feels like it is new, which is why Austen is such a great writer and why this movie can be appreciated by anyone.

The double-whammy of (a) arty drama and (b) really more of a story for women.You know, some of the classics are classic, and some are just pretty boring. It's based on the 19th century novel by Jane Austen, and, well for an action movie guy like me, a lotta lotta stuff has blown up in movies since the 1800s and it just didn't keep my attention. However, I'm quite willing to believe that for those with a greater emotional appreciation for drama and a greater refinement of taste on the arty side, this might be a great film.Who should see this film-- Women who like dramas-- Anybody with an appreciation for 19thcentury fare Room with A View, Pride andPrejudice, endless British upper class bickering about daddy,etc. By the way, check out Bridget Jones's Diarywhich will be right up your alley and accessible to guyslike me, too.I'll give Mansfield Park (hey, I'm entitled to an opinion) only a 4 out of 10.

Her books lend themselves to different approaches &#150; from the almost page-for-page reproduction of the BBC mini-series 'Pride and Prejudice' to the almost unrecognisable California-isation of 'Clueless'. This film is somewhere in between. The story is the same &#150; poor young relative comes to stay at country estate, grows up with family, falls in love (but doesn't realize it) with pious younger son of family, is pursued by rakish neighbour whose sister is her rival for the son's affections, avoids disgrace and marries the reverend one. Three things stand out. First, the cast, most of whom are young, eager, not famous, and convincing. Frances O'Connor is exactly right as the house mouse Fanny with deep passion and a strong self-regard beating beneath her bodice. The object of her affections, Edmund, is played by Jonny Lee Miller, previously seen as the shambolic Sick Boy in 'Trainspotting'. He is still a trifle neurasthenic but here is rather more sympathetic. The Crawfords, the rakish neighbours, played by Alessandro Nivola and Embeth Davitz are both good-looking and vaguely evil, or are at least operating according to different values from the romantic Fanny and the pure Edmund. They are strongly supported by the older cast, in particular Sheila Gish as Fanny's snooty aunt Mrs Norris, and Harold Pinter as Sir Thomas, the paterfamilias with his autocratic manner concealing a strong need to be liked &#150; not easy when you own slaves in Antigua. Pinter, a most distinguished playwright, started as an actor and has not lost his touch.Second, the camera-work. This might be a costume drama but the set is minimally furnished and instead the camera concentrates on the cast's faces, presenting a considerable challenge to the actors who must both sound and look right at every moment. No gorgeous interiors, only one brief glimpse of a social event (Fanny's coming out Ball), no battles and one brief sex scene. Instead we get an involving, if somewhat improbable story with some well-rounded characters. I say 'improbable' because it does seem hard to believe that poor little Fanny would really stand up to Sir Thomas' pressure to marry the young, well-mannered, handsome, wealthy, socially prominent Henry Crawford, who is attracted to her, just because there was something vaguely untrustworthy about him. But I suppose that was Ms Austen's point &#150; marriage to obtain position is bound to be a disaster. But then so could be marriage for love, as Fanny's own mother had found. Is spinsterhood the only alternative for someone who wants to be their own woman?Third, the location. Here the film is geographically true to the novel, which is set in Northhamptonshire and Portsmouth. The Northampton location is Kirby Hall, a grand Elizabethan mansion now partially ruined, and not lived in since the 1760s. The lack of interior décor produces a stage-like effect rather at odds with the pervasive use of close-ups and the naturalistic dialogue with its occasional anachronisms. The building, really a glorious ruin, is more of a metaphor than a set, but what is the metaphor? The passing of the landed aristocracy in the face of the industrial revolution (only just underway)? The noble, ancient but actually rather depraved and dissolute family? Or, if you are a moderately bad Baronet, the need to make a buck anyway you can to rebuild the west wing? Kirby Hall is not Mansfield Park, but what is it? Maybe just a cheap location. Anyway, the gardens are interesting. "},{"Title":"Thanks to the interesting story, this a nice drama","Date":"12 July 2005","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Normally I'm not too much a fan of costume drama's situated in Victorian England. In fact, I'm not really a fan of the genre of the costume drama in general. But from time to time such a movie is shown on television and then I almost always give it a try. The main reason for that is because there sometimes can be a big diversity in these movies. Not all of them show Victorian society as the perfect mix of elegance, beauty and good manners. Some of them also show the less pretty side and that's something that I can appreciate.In Mansfield Park we see how Fanny Price, the 10-year old daughter from poor parents, goes to live at Mansfield Park, the estate of her aunt's husband, Sir Thomas. When she arrives, she isn't seen as a full member of the family, but is more or less used as a cheap maid. But she is a clever girl who likes to read all the books that she can lay her hands on and has a keen eye for seeing and describing the irony in many situations. As she grows older, she becomes especially close to Edmund, Sir Thomas's younger son. When she has reached the age all girls are supposed to be presented to society so they can find a husband, she comes to the attention of Henry Crawford. Sir Thomas is very pleased with this match, but Fanny isn't the typically docile young woman. She wants Henry Crawford to prove himself worthy and while Edmund is courting Henry's sister, it's getting more and more obvious that the Crawford fortune was made by the use of slavery in America, which makes it a lot harder for Fanny to see the man's good nature...Despite the fact that this movie looked a lot like all the other costume drama's that I've ever seen - for some that must be a positive aspect, for me however it is not - I must say that I quite liked it. Especially the fact that Fanny was a more or less rebellious young lady in a time period that this was absolutely not done, makes this movie a lot more interesting for me. I don't like it when they try to make you believe that these people lived in a perfect society, because that certainly wasn't the case. The contradiction and contrast between the poor and the rich wasn't forgotten for once and that's a good thing. But next to the story, this movie has other fine things to offer as well. The acting for instance is more than OK. Except for Frances O'Connor, who played the role of the adult Fanny Price, I didn't really know any of the actors. That's not so weird when you know that most of them have only played in TV-movies and mini-series, two things that I don't watch very often. Also worth mentioning are the costumes and the decors. It's obvious that they have taken quite some time in making it all look realistic and believable and I sure can appreciate such a good effort.All in all this is a fine example in the genre of the costume drama. It's perhaps thanks to the contrast between poor and rich and the fact that they have used some fine humor in the story, that I liked it more than average. Whatever it is that made me like it more, it worked and that's why I give this movie a 7/10. "},{"Title":"A nice wicked comedy based on an 1814 Jane Austen book.","Date":"24 October 2000","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  The film was set in the late 1790s and the early 1800s in England.  Fanny Price is the oldest of a large, poor family and at 12 she is sent to live with her wealthy aunt over 100 miles away, at Mansfield Park.  As Fanny is getting into the carriage she askes her mother, How long will I be gone? Her mother just turns away. Apparently it was common in those days to give away children.  Fanny accepts her fate and is politely taken in by her aunt's family, but she is always an outsider. A very smart and progressive outsider.From her arrival at Mansfield Park, it is clear that Fanny has a bond with Edmund, and you feel early on that they will eventually get together.  But, it looks like they will both marry others, and that's really when the good part of the movie begins. It truly is a wicked comedy with clever dialog and funny situations.  It's treatment of flirting, explicit sexual references, infidelity, mistreatment of slaves on Antigua, and the like were very risque' for that time.Eventually Edmund becomes a minister, and is about to marry a lady who turns out to be wretched, Fanny almost marries the wretched lady's brother, who turns out wretched also.  And all ends well with Fanny and Edmund getting the last laugh together while all the others lead miserable lives as outcasts of various sorts.The simple message in this story is be true to yourself, as Fanny and edmund ultimately do, and all will turn out well.I rate this film a strong 7 of 10, for a fun story and excellent acting, but not quite as good as those I rate 8. I saw it on DVD. The picture is first-rate, and digital dolby 5.1 sound is good, although this type of movie does not have much in the surround channels. The scenery and musical score are both lush.

The setting and costumes were beautiful, the actors were charming and attractive, and everything was very well done.  I think Ms. Austen would have approved. "}]
