The nostalgia is not just for the stars, Newman, Hackforth and Garner but for the whole private eye genre of the forties. All three stars show why they have been tops for so long. At 73 Newman can still make the action and the sex scenes creditable. It gives new hope to men of a certain age everywhere! It is a film that probably plays better on TV than in a movie house. The pace is leisurely but there is some nice sharp dialogue and atmospheric camera work. All this plus a moody score by Leonard Bernstein make for a highly professional entertainment.

I've read some reviews of people wondering why widely acclaimed filmmaker Robert Benton has made this movie. A short answer To provide screen experience to new starlets with veteran actors.There are 3 of those starlets in this film. First one is Reese Witherspoon. 1998 was an important milestone for her. She's been busy whole year long with Pleasantville and Overnight Delivery. Through 1998 summer she played in Twilight, thus she has bold scenes with Liev Schreiber. Even though she has a cameo role as Mel Ames in the film, her role includes the only nudity content of her box-office movies career. Yet, Twilight features its queen Susan Sarandon. For me, this is Sarandon's third best after Atlantic City and White Palace. She comes out of pool, starts walking in Eve outlook, looking for her Adam, then Newman comes by.The second starlet is Liev Schreiber. He plays Mel's date at Mexico. While Mel lies naked on a couch, she asks him Do you love me?. He keeps his silence a bit while staring at her tits, and hinders himself from replying No, I just love your tits. Thankfully Mel speaks before him I mean it doesn't really matter you love me or not. If all the movie critics thought the same way that Robert Benton has written the worst script of his life, they might be right.The third starlet is Patrick Malone. If you read this review right now, and don't know who Patrick Malone is, it's because herein Twilight he wasted his chance of a lifetime due to his imitation of Will Smith. A young actor in Hollywood must not copy other actors of same career level. I actually liked Malone's harmony with Newman playing his partner, if only he could have played his own style. He was one of the supporting actors in Lawrence Kasdan's Grand Canyon(1991).Even though the cast is rich on paper, the whole plot is turning around Paul Newman. No one is able to come closer to him, and he acts only with his self-belief. From my point of view, the main issue is not the script nor the cheapness of the story telling methods. Nobody but Benton and Newman, is in the mood of making a movie. Gene Hackman, James Garner, Stockard Channing spoil the story. So many stars make it darker. Only Newman and Sarandon could have been enough to fill the cast, since the storyline is so simple.

Yes, it is true that an average viewer should be able to spot the villain, well before the ex-cop and ex-private investigator does so in the film by comparing life-styles. But that is what young audiences will look for in the movie. What I liked about the script were the subtle dialogues ranging from Samuel Johnson misquotes to acerbic one-liners that developed each of the characters slowly. Take the misty-eyed Lt. Verna (Stockard Channing) greeting Ross as an old acquaintance and then closing the dialogue with the icy Cuff him! to the arresting officers. You have an extra-ordinary script here and everywhere in the film.This film is not action-packed; it is heavy on dialogue requiring a mature mind to take in the clever character buildup. Sarandon's character, in particular, was well developed leading to a charming finale.Benton never appealed to me as a great director; nonetheless this film's strength lies in his script (co-scripted by Russo), a thoroughly delightful cast ensemble, and a notable camerawork by Sobocinsky.Finally, I thought the film's name was a wonderful and appropriate selection.

It's especially wonderful to see this skill applied to a film like Nobody's Fool. In Twilight, Newman is reunited with Nobody's Fool director-screenwriter Robert Benton and is essentially playing the same character. Only this time the character is placed in a manipulative plot that seems like retreads from better crime films. It's simply a window for Newman to show is talents. Other screen veterans--Gene Hackman, Susan Sarandon and James Garner (who is just as natural in front of a camera as Newman)--are also on display, but are not given the screen time to display their skills. It's really Newman's picture and the rest of the actors are simply guests. Stockard Channing is underused in the role of a police investigator and one of my favorite character actors, M. Emmet Walsh is completely wasted in the role of a...well...a corpse, I guess. The message--about people in the twilight of their years--is heavy-handed and the story makes absolutely no sense logically.

Every element that went into it should have produced an interesting film, after all, this was the second collaboration between Mr. Benton and Richard Russo, a wonderful writer on his own right. Unfortunately, there are no sparks in this slow evolving take on deceit and an unsolved crime in L.A.The opening scenes are deceiving because they take place in Puerto Vallarta. We see Harry Ross, a private investigator, going to the rescue of a rich girl, Mel Ames. Mel is a gorgeous creature that is seen in all her glory, and it seems to have been planned that way in order to hook the viewer into staying for the rest of the story. Alas, beautiful Mel goes straight and is only seen in a couple of other scenes! We lose, that's all!As a film noir, there are too many things that don't make sense in Twilight. The film is not a complete waste, although the pace, being slow, doesn't add anything to the story, or the way we feel after sitting through it after a while.Paul Newman makes an interesting appearance as Harry. James Garner, another great personality, does the best with the small part of Raymond Hope. Susan Sarandon is mysterious and secretive as Catherine and Gene Hackman doesn't have much to do. Reese Witherspoon, making her screen debut, is lovingly captured by the camera. Stockard Channing, one of the best stage and film actress working in films today, is wasted. Giancarlo Esposito is the only one that brings a badly needed comic relief to the movie. M. Emmet Walsh, Liev Schrieber, Margo Martindale, and John Spencer play minor roles.While the film is far from horrible, but it requires a lot of patience from the viewer. The crisp cinematography by Piotr Sobocinski gives the film a beautiful patina. Also the moody music score of Elmer Bernstein and the production design of David Gropman, contribute to make the film appear much better than it is.

His old colleague Raymond (James Garner) tries to persuade Harry to get away from it all.The film is about immoral people who are wealthy and wish to stay ahead and use others for their own means.

Newman, Hackman, Garner, Channing and Sarandon provide sophisticated and amusing banter. Although Ms. Sarandon and Channing are somewhat younger than the aforementioned actors, they blend in with the boys smoothly. The talents of the supporting cast, Liev, Reese, Giancarlo and mucho(Margo Martindale) are not lost either. The depth and intricacy of the story line does not suffer as a result of the cute and witty banter rather, the humor augments the tone and helps to set the stage for the evolving dramatic plot twists.I would be remiss to exclude lauding the hauntingly beautiful and appropriate soundtrack and recurring theme by Elmer Bernstein. His contribution is as important to the subtlety and color of the story line as any cast member's. Although all the characters shine in this Hollywood detective escapade, Mr. Garner shines the brightest in his sardonically gritty role, even in its more limited time allotment. A good flick to catch, especially if you like the subtlety of substance over form!

That can be said of many movies and also about Twilight. No, this isn't Team Edward or Team Jacob, it's a film noir about wrapped in secrets, ghosts from the past and some skeletons in the closet (more like on a swimming pool!). On the front seat of this we have the team Paul Newman and director Robert Benton, re-teaming after the successful Nobody's Fool; and the amazing passengers of this are Susan Sarandon, Gene Hackman, James Garner, Stockard Channing, Giancarlo Esposito, Reese Witherspoon, Liev Schreiber, John Spencer, Margo Martindale and M. Emmet Walsh (horribly reduced to a pivotal role but with no speaking lines). Newman plays Harry, a veteran private detective in the twilight of his career and years, decadent and living of favors in the house of Jack Ames, a dying veteran actor (Hackman) and his wife (Sarandon), also an actress, doing some jobs here and there for them, covering up their dirt. Then, during one of those jobs, after almost getting killed by another detective, he decides to check out what's behind the many out-coming mysteries which are appearing on his way, things that might have to do with his past and also things from the past of his bosses/friends. Favorable point for him the unusual help of a sidekick (Esposito) - in terms of script kind of strange but it works well. Low point for him flames getting higher between him and Ames wife; her brat daughter (Witherspoon) whose purpose is to put the man down just because she doesn't like him, due to an incident involving her boyfriend (Schreiber). Fine movie but quite cheap if you think about all the elements involved. Quite simplified as noir don't tend to be, convoluted in so many dialogs and never all that interesting or clever, Twilight begs for our attention but doesn't give much in return. When you see the mystery close of getting solved, already figuring out who's the bad guy, you end up asking yourself Why should I care about this story?. Well, you should care but the movie doesn't impels you in such direction. You're there for the actors and that sometimes works replacing the excitement, the thrills, the action, everything that is missing here. While it feeds us with Newman giving an outstanding performance, it doesn't offer much when it comes to show the other actors, most of them reduced to a few scenes (Garner stands out with perfection though). Once again we see Newman's character trying to show he can hit the top of his craft even though he's not fast and younger as before, realizing that things have changed but he still can find a way to do something. But he played this several times before and in better projects (The Verdict, Nobody's Fool and his Oscar winning Eddie Felson in The Color of Money). Sarandon brings lots of sensuality in her role but at times it seems director Benton and his writing partner Richard Russo are forcing things far too much when it comes to presenting those sexy moments. Hackman was a little underused in this, but presents some class act during his first scenes. Conclusion it's not fun as it could and should be but it's watchable.

At the police station, he runs into another old pal and colleague, now retired, Raymond Hope.Harry has a developing interest in Catherine and ends up in bed with her one night. He also is blackmailed by a parole officer called Mucho and by Mel's old boyfriend, Jeff, now an ex-con.A dying Jack Ames feels betrayed that Harry has had a fling with his wife. Harry, meanwhile, is forced to face the reality that his friends have been deceitful and manipulative of him.Raymond Hope tries to persuade Harry to get away from it all, but showdown ensues in Raymond's glass-walled hillside home.The movie has a great cast headed by Newman,Sarandon and Hackman.Unfortunately,the intelligent script isn't engaging enough to keep the viewer tuned in as the plot is lacking in energy and interest.The talent of the excellent cast is what made up for the movie and saved it from complete ruin.But nevertheless,the actors/actresses tried their best to make the most out of the screenplay and the final product turned out to be better than average.Overall,Twilight is a movie that has an excellent cast in a lifeless screenplay still deserves a 9 out of 10 rating.

He's living with them because he was hurt on the job when after being hired to bring back their daughter Reese Witherspoon from running away with Liev Schreiber, Reese accidentally shoots Newman. Don't ask for the circumstances, they have to be seen.Anyway because of what Reese did, Newman is living with her family and one day, he's asked to deliver a package by Hackman to a woman. At the location he finds a fatally shot M. Emmett Walsh still able to shoot at Newman. That sends the whole plot starting which involves the disappearance of a prominent actor and Sarandon's former husband twenty years before.Imagine Philip Marlowe now middle-aged, but entering senior citizenry and you've got Paul Newman in this part. Actually Newman was 74 when he did this role, but could have passed for a dozen years younger. Better still imagine Newman's own Harper which he did in two films and you have a better example.Director Robert Benton assembled a really crackerjack cast in support of those already mentioned. Keep note for James Garner as another retired cop turned private eye, though someone nothing like Jim Rockford, Stockard Channing as Newman's former partner at the LAPD, John Spencer as Channing's boss who would like some explanations as some bodies start to pile up around Newman.Most of all note Margo Martindale who was the woman Newman was supposed to deliver the package to. Note her relationship, personal and professional to at least one other of the cast members. It's a really touching performance of a lonely and frustrated woman.Up to the end of his life, the quality of Paul Newman's work never went down even if he did a clunker or two among his films.

And then a drunk.","Date":"25 February 2012","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" Twilight is directed by Robert Benton who also co-writes the screenplay with Richard Russo. It stars Paul Newman, Susan Sarandon, Gene Hackman, James Garner, Stockard Channing, Reese Witherspoon, Giancarlo Esposito and Liev Schreiber. Music is scored by Elmer Bernstein and cinematography by Piotr Sobocinski.Harry Ross (Newman) is working for Jack (Hackman) and Catherine Ames (Sarandon). When one day he is sent to deliver a package for Jack, it turns out to be the starting point of trouble that opens up a 20 year old missing persons case involving Catherine's ex-husband.Twilight, the word in this case signifying persons in the twilight of their lives, is on the surface a standard murder mystery infused with noirish blood. But although the film never gets above a steady beat, where subtlety of performances and tone are key, it's a better picture than the poor box office it garnered suggests. However, in spite of the quality that comes with said performances and script, the latter sinewy and begging for the mature film fan's attention, picture is a little too subtle for its own good. When action does come into play it feels like an intrusion, misplaced even, which shouldn't be the case as there is, after all, a suspected murder and private investigation going on in the plot. The blend isn't quite right in spite of the intelligence and thought that's gone in to make the characters engaging.The whole calm over chaos approach taken by Benton (Kramer vs. Kramer) is however admirable, many people like dialogue driven movies, especially ones dripping with noir atmospherics, myself included, but it does put itself out as being only accessible to a select audience. That's why it failed at the box office; well that and the fact that this A list cast of some distinction meant expectations went through the roof prior to its release! But there's still much to enjoy as the seasoned performers dally around themes of mortality, loyalty and forbidden fruit, with the rose tinted cloud of nostalgia hovering constantly over head. It's apt that the film clearly harks back to noirish movies of yesterday, for its main characters are forced to constantly look backwards, to times passed, times never to be had again.The good far outweighs the bad here, but you need to be in a select band of film lovers to get the best rewards from it. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Why did they make this movie?","Date":"24 October 1998","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  Mind you, the movie is OK.

Paul Newman makes a payoff for Gene Hackman and murder emerges","Date":"22 May 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" Writer-director Robert Benton does reliably entertaining work with some depth, and the neo-noir Twilight (1998) is no exception. In this movie we have 3 characters who are in the twilight of their lives. Some were also in the twilight of their real careers and lives. Paul Newman died in 2008, James Garner in 2014. Gene Hackman is 85. Susan Sarandon at 68 is from a younger generation and still making movies.Hackman and Sarandon play actors who married 20 years earlier when Sarandon's husband conveniently disappeared, apparently a suicide. Newman is an ex-cop, an ex-private investigator and an ex-drunk who has been living in a room above their garage for two years, after having gotten shot in the leg rescuing their daughter, Reece Witherspoon. They're all living on friendly terms. Newman's let his p.i. license expire. He's content being near Sarandon and living an easy life. Hackman's battling cancer. Garner's another ex-cop who's friendly with them as well.Hackman asks Newman to deliver a package for him, which is obviously blackmail. Newman gets nothing but trouble, launching him into renewed acquaintance with a cop he once worked with, Stockard Channing. Newman soon is in a real mess.As many times as we have seen a similar plot line, it still can be entertaining if done well. This is done well. Newman is outstanding even if we've seen him in such roles before. Maybe it's because he's done this kind of role before. Fairly early on, by the early 70s, Newman overcame the negatives of method acting, disposed of them or hid them away, and developed his own ways. He has a long string of successes and enjoyable portrayals to his credit. He carried on the tradition of major Hollywood stardom. Twilight is his movie, with Hackman, Sarandon and Garner playing supporting roles with their own customary skills.The story moves right along without a moment of boredom, and yet each scene is done meticulously so that we savor the screen interactions. There is some meat to the screenplay. There is some mystery to it even if it has derivative elements. There is enough said and enough left unsaid, enough shown and enough left unshown. Our engagement depends on a balance between these opposites.

Murder, blackmail and betrayal also feature heavily, but it's the complicated relationships between the story's characters that ultimately distinguish this from so many other similar neo-noir thrillers. Its moody atmosphere is established early on by Elmer Bernstein's wonderfully evocative score and the feelings of loss, sorrow and regret that are so apparent in many of the characters add further to the profoundly melancholic feel of the piece.Retired private detective Harry Ross (Paul Newman) works as an odd job man for a couple of old friends who used to be top movie stars and lives in an apartment above their garage. His current arrangements began a couple of years earlier after he'd been hired by Jack (Gene Hackman) and Catherine Ames (Susan Sarandon) to bring back their 17-year-old daughter Mel (Reese Witherspoon) who'd run away to a Mexican resort with her significantly older boyfriend. Harry completed the job successfully but, as a result of a bizarre accident, suffered a bullet wound in the thigh.One day, Jack sends Harry on a seemingly routine job to deliver a package to a woman called Gloria Lamar (Margo Martindale). When Harry arrives at her place, a seriously wounded man shoots at him numerous times before dying. Harry soon establishes that the dead man was an ex-cop who was involved in the investigation into the disappearance of Catherine's fist husband 20 years earlier. Almost immediately, Harry's apprehended by police lieutenant Verna Hollander (Stockard Channing) and during his time being questioned, meets his old friend and fellow retired cop, Raymond Hope (James Garner). Both Raymond and Verna had been colleagues of Harry's during his time as a police detective.After being released by Verna, Harry goes on to carry out his own investigation into the 20-year-old mystery and in the process, makes some interesting findings.The main characters in this movie have all seen better times and reflect on their failures, faded glories and mortality on different occasions. These are people in the twilight of their lives who live with their disappointments and lack of hope for the future but whose strong passions and determination to get what they want, continue to complicate their lives. The all-star cast is brilliant in this movie with Newman, Hackman, Sarandon and Garner all displaying tremendous maturity, subtlety and charisma and Channing, Witherspoon and Martindale all exceptionally good in their supporting roles.

Perpetually down on his luck, Fool's first act watches as Sullivan struggles to claim unpaid wages. For the next hour, things only get worse for Sully he loses bets, loses money, almost loses his leg, is revealed to be estranged from his family and gets thrown into jail.The film's great joke, though, is that Sully is never sullen. Always giving as good as he gets, Sully repeatedly steals machinery from his boss, and flirts with his bosses wife (Melanie Griffith). As the film progresses, we the audience also begin to appreciate just how many people rely upon the unlucky Sully, how lucky they are to have him in their lives, and how upstanding a guy he is when compared to many others in his community.Which is not to say Sully is without flaws. Indeed, Nobody's Fool's climax features the usual improvements and reconcilliations typical of the genre. Sully learns to be a better man, a better father, and attempts to correct mistakes in others he once committed himself. This is all painfully routine. Where the film shines is in Newman's lovable performance, Benton's ceaselessly witty dialogue, and his willingness to sympathise with major and minor characters which lesser films typically villainize.Released four years later, Twilight again stars Newman. This time he plays Harry Ross, an ex-cop and one-time private detective. Like Nobody's Fool, the film's first act watches as Newman damages his leg. Again like Nobody's Fool, the film then begins to question the impotency and disloyalty of its lead character.Throughout Twilight, Newman plays a now familiar archetype the ageing private detective. He's an old timer, washed up, and mocked by all. To make matters worse, everyone believes that Ross lost his penis in a gunfight. Ross' presumed impotency is mirrored to the film's other ageing characters a washed up actress (Susan Sarandon) in her twilight years, and a dying actor (Gene Hackman), both of whom are friends with Ross. The film's moral dilemma hinges around all three characters. Did Hackman and Sarandon collude to kill a man, is Ross helping them, and more importantly, will he cover-up a murder to protect a friend? To say anymore would be to spoil the fun.Twilight is set in California, home of many great sun-bleached noirs. It's also home to Benton's earliest noir, The Late Show, a 1977 feature which starred Art Carny as Ira Wells, an ageing private detective who, like Harry Ross, is accused of being long past his sell-by date. Both films allow their ageing heroes one final blaze of glory. Both films are also unable to transcend the conventions of their genre. Twilight's climax in particular is rife with clichés.7.5/10 - See Cutter's Way and Flesh and Bone (1993).

Unlike most young actresses, however, at least Whitherspoon can look back and know she was exploited in a quality film while she was working with some of the best performers of a generation and one of the biggest movie stars of all time.Harry Ross (Paul Newman) used to be a cop and, after that, used to be a private investigator. But after a job down in Mexico bringing back the rebellious daughter of an aging movie star named Jack Ames (Gene Hackman), Harry gets shot. Ames takes Harry into his home while he recovers, then keeps him around as a handyman and family friend. Two years after the Mexico mess, the cancer-stricken Ames asks Harry to deliver an envelope for him. When he takes it to the instructed address, Harry nearly gets shot by a guy who was himself shot in the gut sometime before Harry arrived. Harry manages to just barely avoid getting killed until the guy dies, after which he discovers the man was named Lester Ivar (M. Emmet Walsh). I var was another former cop turned private eye and Harry learns that Ivar was continuing to investigate the disappearance of a actor 20 years ago. That actor was the then-husband of Jack Ames' current wife Catherine (Susan Sarandon). It seems the actor disappeared just in time to clear the way for Catherine to leave him for Jack. And if you think you know where the story is going based on that little plot twist, you're right. That is where the story goes. Harry's investigation into who killed Ivar, who's blackmailing Jack Ames and what happened to Catherine's first husband brings him into contact with another old private eye buddy (James Garner) and an old flame on the police force (Stockard Channing) before culminating in the sort of darkly hopeful ending that the best film noir always aspires to pull off.This is a very good movie. As I mentioned earlier, it's not much of a mystery. You might not be able to guess every single detail of the story before it unfolds, but you figure out early on how it's going to play out and even how it will likely end up. There's very little whodunit going on here, but that's not a problem. This isn't a movie about how a mystery gets solved. It's about the people caught up in it.The actors in Twilight are every bit as good as you could expect or want with performers of this caliber. Whitherspoon gives the weakest performance of the lot, but what young woman could measure up to the veteran talent in this cast? Newman, Sarandon, Hackman, Garner and Channing all do superb work as those rarest of all Hollywood movie characters &#x96; grown ups. These aren't old people tagging along in a young person's world and they aren't characters who behave a decade or two younger and stupider than they actually are. These are people with histories that define then and histories they sometimes struggle to overcome. Newman and Hackman are especially marvelous to watch as two men who both know the thread of their life is running thin and are readying themselves for that end. Even though you know where the story is going, it's a great pleasure to watch these characters get there.Twilight is quite a nice film with lots of real human emotion, humor and drama. It takes a very down-to-Earth approach to desperate acts and how they can shape people's lives, in contrast to many films where it seems like every aspect of existence is heightened and exaggerated to ridiculous levels. Newman made a handful of enjoyable and classy movies like Twilight at the end of his career and they serve as a worthy capstone to his remarkable achievements.

Miss Witherspoon is prominently featured in the opening few minutes (with some of her features famously quite prominent)but she otherwise does not factor much into the film.  At a crucial moment in these opening scenes she accidentally shoots Paul Newman (a Private Investigator sent to retrieve 17 year-old Reese from a weekend of concupiscence with her slightly older boyfriend at a resort in Mexico).  Her little girl-like panicked and blurtingly apologetic reaction- eyes like saucers, hand against the mouth- to this incident embodies every/any character Miss Witherspoon has portrayed on screen thus far (including, presumably the girl in Sweet Home Alabama, which I have not yet seen).  It was quite an illuminating moment for those interested in her career.Onward, however, to the subject at hand the movie itself.  When cast in 1998, as I mentioned, Miss Witherspoon was just another young aspiring actress in California.  The rest of the cast is like a Who's Who of established Hollywood stars, which in and of itself makes for an entertaining film, despite a certain severe weakness to the story and direction, which conspire to make the plot really only of incidental interest to the viewer.Paul Newman, looking every bit as aged as he is supposed to be, is cast as a retired Los Angeles police officer, Private Investigator, husband and alcoholic.  Ever since the shooting incident in Mexico, he has been staying as the houseguest of the wealthy actor and actress (Gene Hackman and Susan Sarandan) who had dispatched him on that mission.  Mr. Hackman's character is ill, and Miss Saradan's character is very seductive towards their guest/companion/gofer.  When an ostensibly simple task for Mr. Newman's character(an apparent blackmail pay-off on behalf of Gene Hackman)takes the film into a new direction as a mystery, James Garner (old Jim Rockford himself) saunters into the script as well as an old friend of Gene Hackman's, and former police force colleague of Newman's.  Stockard Channing (Rizzo, of Grease) appears as well as an LAPD Lieutenant, and former partner (among other duties) of the Newman character.The plot wanders along about blackmailers, the mysterious disappearance of Susan Sarandon's first husband twenty years before, remote mountain cabins and the efforts of Newman to piece things together.  A former partner is miraculously brought into the action when the plot requires, and dead bodies continue to accumulate while Newman, now in a Rockford-like mode struggles to solve the riddle before the LAPD haul him in. It's more like a TV movie mystery at this point than anything else, but that's not entirely bad.I think some important scenes or pieces of dialogue must have ended up on the cutting room floor, but it's easy enough to follow the trail and guess who really did what back then, and how it will turn out before the closing credits.   Reese's topless scenes were rather gratuitous and not necessary to the story, and now that she's America's newest sweetheart and movie star, (not to mention noted wife and mommy)will probably never be repeated on the silver screen again. The twilight of the careers of the older established actors has been eclipsed by the dawning of Reese's star.  It's interesting to watch, and the movie's not all that bad either.

At one time, he retrieved their 17-year-old daughter (Reese Witherspoon) from a tryst in Mexico.Catherine was married before, to an actor named Billy, who has long believed to have been lost at sea. There have always been rumblings, however, that Billy was murdered. When Jack asks Harry to deliver an envelope to a woman named Gloria Lamar, Harry suspects blackmail. He gets more than he bargained for.Twilight has the noirish feel of a '40s film, right down to the Channing character being named Verna. The name Gloria Lamar is certainly an homage to the '40s as well. It also has three actors inextricably linked with PIs - Newman, Hackman, and Garner.With all of that, the low key Twilight is really style over substance. Its pace is lethargic, and the director seemed more interested in setting up striking images - such as Sarandon kneeling on the ground at her ranch, Newman watching Garner in a mirror, etc., than the actual story. The story lacks urgency.All of the acting is very good, with Newman at 73 still handsome, still sexy, and still able to play a tough guy.Worth seeing for the cast and atmosphere.

The plot is noir-ish, not too exciting, the dialogues tongue-in- cheek, including a few nice one-liners (Mama Cass died choking on a chicken bone, you know? ), but ultimately, the whole affair appears a bit too laid-back to evoke more than dozy interest.

Noir plots tend to be tortuously complex and not particularly satisfying on any genuine level (beyond the occasional thrill of predicting a plot twist or spotting the murderer).  Usually, the killers in these films have one of three motives money, lust, or sometimes money AND lust.  So, for the viewers, watching these films becomes a matter of connecting the very familiar dots and witnessing the predictable plot unfold.Yet somehow, the best film noir pieces somehow manage to rise above the genre's limitations.  We all seem to love The Big Sleep because of the witty dialogue and sexual tension, but not because we're particularly fascinated by the plot.  It seems that even a movie with a pedestrian story-line that doesn't make much sense can be considered a classic, if other elements pick up the slack.  Sadly, Twilight can't avoid bumping its head against the film noir glass ceiling in the same way that Bogie's best films can.  Maybe that's because the dialogue in Twilight is merely outrageous rather than extremely clever.  It's fun to watch the characters in this movie swap OTT insults, but there's something so glib about the tone that it doesn't quite work.  I laughed throughout the whole movie, but had a hard time figuring out whether I was laughing with it or at it.But hey, I can't totally knock a film that features Paul Newman dunking a punk's head into a plate of chicken wings.  Or, for that matter, a totally gratuitous scene of James Garner urinating over a balcony.  One thing Twilight gets right is that it's crazy and cool in the way that film noir should be crazy and cool.  And of course, as every other reviewer has pointed out, it's a privilege to watch so many experienced actors strut their impressive stuff in one film.  For the record, I think Gene Hackman gives the most nuanced performance, but since he's been my favorite contemporary actor for years, I might be prejudiced!Nevertheless, these great stars did deserve a better vehicle.  I didn't hate the plot of Twilight, as some others did, but that's only because I'm used to film noir and its limitations.  I'm surprised that so many people were shocked by the bad script, because it's not really bad, just typical  mystery fare.  The only real crime that Twilight commits is not being quite so good as the old movies that inspired it; sadly, it's more like a Janet Evanovich mystery than a Raymond Chandler mystery.

A harmless errand turns into a brush with death and reveals clues to an apparent suicide two decades ago. This drama brings an all star cast, including Gene Hackman, Paul Newman, Susan Sarandon and James Garner as leads.Twilight however, can't live up to the expectation. One of the problems is the cast itself. Of the 9 major speaking roles, 6 are over 50 years of age, making the plot feel downright elderly. The movie is somber and always serious, but the script has the actors saying and doing silly things. One has to believe that Paul Newman (the retired PD/PI) is basically inept and foolish at the beginning, but dominating and in control by the finale. That situation might be more believable in a rookie film.But muddled characters are at home in this movie. They appear and disappear as needed, withhold information when they have no reason to, do things that defy explanation, change their loyalties with little reason or complaint. Plot devices that might seem cliche in some directors hands, seem heavyhanded or infantile in this movie. The few action sequences are filmed poorly with one notable exception. Some characters seem to have no point at all and should have been written out.  Sarandon, Schreiber and Hackman however, are exceptions and give fine performances. Too bad they had such minor roles. The plot has major blinders on as well. For instance, Newman is found at multiple crime scenes in compromising situations. At none of these is he given more than a stern questioning and a nasty look. The motivations of the police are ignored to better serve the mechanations of the plot. For other characters experiences are forgotten, obvious possibilities are ignored, coincidental meetings are commonplace, and the bad guys painstakingly leave a trail back to themselves for Newman. Heck, they may as well have named Reese Witherspoon's character Plot Device for all the purpose she has in the movie. Although she may have been included to attract the under 70 crowd.By the end all of the characters are required to be so mallable and shadowy that none of them seem real, none can be trusted and you certainly cant care enough about their welfare to be concerned about the conclusion.

Garner is another former cop, who it turns out had shot and killed the former husband after he fell into the dry pool at the country home, then buried his body near the pool. Newman finds the skeleton, discovers the bullet hole in the skull, confronts Garner, they have a shoot out, Newman survives.  Hackman is dying of cancer.As I say in my summary, the story is not particularly novel nor riveting, but the great actors are a lot of fun to watch.  It is not clear why the film is titled Twilight.

Channing, Garner, and Liev Schrieber are good in support, but I found the Giancarlo Esposito character offensive. Benton did much better with this type of film with THE LATE SHOW.

The direction lacked the spark, could've made better use of the locations. The photography is fine but Robert Benton never really got his teeth stuck into the film. Benton lacked the visual sense, needed more style.The performances are fine, but nothing made them special. The dialogue wasn't interesting and a lot of it is predictable. The film just doesn't give anything knew to the genre.The cast was perfect but the script doesn't give them anything to get there teeth into. The story's climax is unsatisfactory, I really didn't care.A great cast but a disappointing script and direction.

Not to mention Susan Sarandon.  I would have been in heaven watching these five sit around talking about the weather.  And it would have been more interesting.  The script does not hold up -- at all.  The dialogue is wretchedly hackneyed, and the plot holes are huge enough for Godzilla to fall through.  The pacing is dreadfully slow, and the photography does a very poor job of trying to emulate film noir.  The ending did not work for me either, but by that time, I was just happy to see it end, and there are very few Paul Newman films I ever felt that way about.

I know, because I did!  I watched until the end just because I wanted to be sure that I didn't miss anything out of this awful movie.  I  know, I am masochist! Where should I start?  The scenario?  I could spit and hit someone that would do a better job on it (to paraphrase a line from the superb Swimming with Sharks)!!!  When watching a movie like this one I wonder if there was a scenario at all or they just made up the story as they were filming it. That would explain in part why this is the dullest story I have seen in months. As for the actors, they fail to deliver the scripted cliches with any conviction.  It was painful to watch Paul Newman, Gene Hackman and Susan Sarandon, as well their star ridded support cast prostituting themselves in this horrible movie.  But then, money makes the world go round&#133; "},{"Title":"Here's Looking At You Reese!","Date":"5 April 2005","Score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" This isn't a very good movie, but if you wanna see Reese Witherspoon topless this is your movie. Lucky for you it happens early in the movie.The rest of the movie really isn't worth watching.Wow I just noticed you have to write at least ten lines........bummer. The movie has a bunch of big names, seems like they could have done more. The mystery is boring. The characters are uninteresting. oh, Susan Saranden is naked also. She was fifty one when they filmed this. Does anyone want to see a naked fifty one year old Susan Saranden?? Not me. Reese is only twenty two and looks very firm and pert in this film, again this movies only saving grace. "}]
