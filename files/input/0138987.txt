He commits to going on 20 dates and recording the results. Unfortunately, halfway through, he falls in love with one of his dates and now has to figure out how to complete the project without alienating his new love.What makes this different from standard mockumentaries -- and what some of the other IMDB reviewers seem to be missing -- is that, while it's clear that the final film isn't a true account of the events (some of the dates are obviously faked, and Elie the villainous producer can't really be THAT evil), it isn't so clear whether Myles Berkowitz (credited as writer and director, as well as star) started out with a serious intent to make a documentary, or whether it was meant to be fiction from the outset.Most of the evidence points to Berkowitz' initial sincerity. This *is* his only film (except for a bit part in No Small Affair, 16 years before this movie), and Elie *is* listed as Executive Producer. The official budget *is* the stated $60K. Most of the early dates seem real -- it's only the later ones that start to feel scripted, especially the feminist ballerina.One thing that gives this movie its charm, then, is that while Myles (the character) fumes about the way in which his original vision for the movie is eroding away from pressure from Elie, Berkowitz (the filmmaker) seems to be going through the same genuine quandary for a different reason -- it didn't take his full 20 dates to find love, and NOW what's he supposed to do?The cover job is both charming and disorienting He goes back over the old footage and edits it so it looks like it could have been a mockumentary from the start, but plays it from the hip so it looks like a mockumentary pretending to be a documentary.Wouldn't Robert McKee be proud?Others might not have the same sense of pride. The film will come off as either a clever if ham-fisted attempt to make lemon footage into lemonade, or a pretentious and annoying trip into the avenues of Independent Film by a blind drunkard.Viewer's choice, and it seems to depend on what the viewer thinks of Myles Is he annoying, or is he cute?I thought he was cute, and while the film is hardly a classic, it's worth a try. Look for it on cable (that's where I found it), and if you're sick of it after half an hour, turn it off and not much lost.

The style is definitely independent in nature as it takes a new look at the style of documentaries and entertainment. 20 Dates is a very adept look at dating in LA... honest, raw, and true. To make it entertaining, Myles Berkowitz even pokes fun at sleazy film makers via an underlying 'Mafia style' producer who you never see on film, but you definitely hear him with his threats of broken body parts and an accent straight out of Brooklyn. This movie should be on your list of must see.

He wrote it, stars in it, and directs the film. To say that his presence is unpleasant is being nice.  I cannot imagine anyone finding this guy attractive, and yet the film never shows that either.  Knowing beforehand that most of this picture was staged doesn't help the matter any better.  Berkowitz never mentions that part of his film is faked.  Although I usually don't care about cursing in films, I couldn't help but be very sickened that such a light-hearted movie would have such a plethora of F-words.  Most of the people on-screen are dreadful human beings, and I question Berkowitz to why he must follow a dream that he so obviously isn't cut out for.  It's like being nail-gunned to a wall at a party you cannot bear.  The best moments are suspiciously off camera, which might be accounted for in the I made this up part of the documentary.

He also is keen to make his debut film that will launch his movie career. He decides to combine the two biggest failures of his life - his film `career' and his love life to make a film about the real search for love in LA.  He sets out to film 20 dates to capture the moment where two people fall in love.  However he is in for a rocky road - not only does he have trouble with his dates but the guy funding his film wants it to be something other than what Myles envisages it to be.This film was made on the cheap and is a mix of documentary and mockumentary; there is no way that all the stuff in this film is real - certainly I never accepted that Elie the producer was the character that the film painted him to be.  However, the majority of it seems to be relatively real and the majority of it is funny - which is the important thing here. Forget Myles arty pretensions about filming true love as it happens, the point here is wit and fun.  The film is a very particular type of wit and if you're not into it then it is likely that you will hate the film; for me I really enjoyed the light humour of the whole piece and found it amusing even if I wouldn't call it hilarious.I really liked the invention of some parts of it the comparisons of the budget in military terms (his film would be the equivalent of one French soldier surrendering to whoever it happens to be at war with), the stuff around Elie, the `meetings' with his agent etc.  In fact most of the funny stuff is staged - and it is for the best.  If I was being cynical I would question whether or not 95% of the film was scripted and acted as natural. But it didn't bother me because I found it funny.Myles himself is a strange guy; he is quite abrasive and pretty unpleasant at times and is a bit of a jerk.  He definitely doesn't deserve Elisabeth but it is easy to be amused by his cruel humour at times.  He holds the attention pretty well when he is on dates, but as an actor I didn't think much of him at one point we learn he refused an offer for a script on the basis that he would only sell it if he could star - he really needs to focus on writing as neither directing or acting appears to be his thing on the basis of this.  The support crew are hilarious.  Myles sound guy and cameraman are funny when they have the chance, while both Richard the agent and Elie are hilarious and don't mind sending themselves up!Overall, treat this film as a comedy rather than a documentary - large chunks of it are staged, but it actually helps the film.  It is very rough but it is different and quite enjoyable; it is funny in witty ways and it is funny in inventive ways and both styles work really well.  It is not a perfect film (Myles' comes across like a daytime tv presenter at times) but it is fun; and that's all I was really looking for.

My impression is that he started the project semi-seriously, then quickly realized that it would be pathetic and not funny unless he made the situations more and more ridiculous. As a result, the whole thing has an uneasy, cheap and insincere feeling about it.As someone smartly pointed out, the film has two of the dates suing and putting restraining orders on Myles and yet they appear in the film, which would be impossible as it would require a consent form. It also appears to me that the majority of women who appear as the dates are professional actresses (albiet not famous ones, excepting Tina Carrere) -- they are simply too obviously pretty, polished, thin and comfortable in front of the camera to be average civilians.Mr. Berkowitz makes a classic error in only casting this kind of very pretty thin actress, instead of utilizing a variety of believable women, which might have made the premise (even in a mockumentary) more believable and funnier. He also skates over what is probably his real-world problem, and which is that both the movie character and the real world Myles Berkowitz appear to be functionally unemployed (his real life IMDb credits are practically non-existent, excepting this film). Even in the world of the movie, his ex-wife divorced him for never being employed. I think the viewer (let alone Mr. Berkowitz's real life dates) are deserving of an explanation of he manages to live in one of the most expensive urban environments in the US, in a luxury apartment, driving a fancy car and eating out at pricey restaurants when he doesn't seen to have any source of income whatsoever. (Is he drug dealer? Living off his rich parents? No clue!)You can get away with most anything in a film, if the jokes are really funny. 20 Dates is painfully, embarrassingly UN-funny. Mr. Berkowitz's idea of a joke is to have his character, while on restaurant dates, announce to his companions how the food served is likely to give him either diarrhea or constipation -- the WORST kind of childish potty humor.It is not very surprising to discover that Mr. Berkowitz never made a film before 20 Dates and in the last 8 years, has not made a single film, appeared as an actor in anyone else's film OR had a writing or producing credit of any kind. My gut instinct tells me that this film was not financed by Elie (the gangster money man who appears off-camera) but more likely by Mr. Berkowitz's affluent parents, or perhaps represents a shocking abuse of credit cards.

So what we really ended up watching was a series of TV sitcoms exploring the meaning of life while on the trail for a mate with a camera and a sound boom. The narrator could only express a sense of cluelessness at each turn. Art imitates life. Even the film maker, himself, admitted that the premise could only be stretched so far when he took a different tack, one where he had finally found true love but still must continue dating other women to complete his movie. An unsuccessful attempt to reanimate a dead story line. Some nice touches, however. The movie critic, with his deadpan sudo-psychoanalysis, added a sense of poignant humor. I also enjoyed the satirical moment with his bashing of the French, given that film critics normally swoon over the French as the masters of cinema. Then there is role of Elie, the financier, which offered some momentary humorous distractions by relieving the viewer from Berkowitz's constant self-examination. It's ironic that the woman on the first date observed to our hero during dinner that everything was really about him. I submit that it was a warning to the viewers as much as it was dialogue.

I don't have a problem with that, so long as the guy is interesting.  But a nebbish looking for love in LA?  THAT'S unique and interesting?  Getin line, buster! What got me irritated, though, was that some of the dates he filmed didn't know he was filming them.  That's just duplicitous and self-serving on the part of the man--not that that's anything unusual, but that rarely makes the guy sympathetic. Besides, when he wants to get intimate with his dates, he turns the camera off.  How hypocritical is that? Overall, very disappointing film, and a very disappointing guy.  I sometimes wonder if the date he wound up with ever stayed with him.  But frankly, I doubt it.

I know some people who went to see THAT movie and thought it was real! 20 Dates was an effective look at dating in big cities in modern times, using a fake Cinema Vérité effect that was obviously tongue in cheek. If you got that, then you could enjoy the movie instead of spending it guessing what was real and what was not. The points were that meeting people is tough, that meeting good people is almost impossible, and that once you meet someone and there's chemistry, it is then real easy to muck it up. The film was well paced, and the characters developed to where you had to watch until the end to see it through. If you want to see the dating topic explored in a different way from today's Hollywood romantic comedies, this is it. In fact, that's another subplot, as evidenced by the constant references to that genre, and the use of the writing consultant as contrast to the real story playing out.

People call him egotistical, but the movie at its core is a candid, plain-spoken exploration of his numerous flaws. This is not the movie that a fundamentally egotistical person would make.There are so many movies about falling in love, but as Berkowitz has figured out, not a whole lot of them are documentaries. The other movies are all about fantasies of love, fantasies that almost always fail to ring true, fantasies that are not instructive, that do not inspire, that it's not possible to relate to. Here we finally have a movie about a real person - however contrived the situation - trying to meet another real person. Now that's something special. And despite the fact that I don't act like Myles, and I wouldn't choose to act like Myles, the fundamental human realism of it made it possible to identify more with this movie than a thousand glorified romance fantasies.It doesn't have to be that way. There are plenty of entirely fictional films that draw me in, make me feel a part of the story. But the love parts never do, because they're always so patently caricatured. The unqiue thing here, the key to Berkowitz' success, is his sacrifice of ego, which enables viewers to ride along into a subject that is all about sacrificing ego.

I'm very glad that I went to see it in the theater, even though I was in the first row of a 40 ft screen theater.  I suppose that this movie may have a lot of flaws to those who study movies in depth, but if you go into it with a light, fun attitude, you'll probably enjoy it.  I actually got a little misty-eyed near the end.  (I know you're saying WHERE?)

In fact, that's the point.  It chronicles the failures, and ultimate success of Miles in his search for love.  And in a twist of fate, the challenge to that success from the same film that brought it in the first place.  While it's a little weary at points, it's rarely predictable.  It's a welcome change from the usual Hollywood cookie cutter romance. Worth seeing.

He  is also trying to make it in the movie business so he comes up with a good idea.  Why not create a documentary by filming his next 20 dates, hopefully showing the dating game in modern Los Angeles?  Myles receives the financial backing and away he goes.  He meets women by arrangement, in grocery stores, at weddings and more.  But will he have to go on 20 actual dates to find the woman of his dreams?This is a humorous, pseudo-documentary that enlightens and entertains. Myles narrates the film with a sly, amusing touch and even when he seems somewhat full of himself, he elicits guffaws.  The women he chooses are all attractive and, for the most part, willing to participate in the film-making process.  The financial backer, unfortunately, is included in the film and uses a never-ending stream of bad language that is offensive.  However, his role is small.  Recommended for anyone searching for yet another romantic comedy, especially one that does not abide by the rules of the typical love story.

I just watched it and thought it was great - not just because of the scenes about real dating and love, but because of Myles's attempts to keep his producer and agent happy and make his first film.  Two things First, you don't need to like the lead to enjoy a movie.  I liked Myles a lot, and thought he did a fine job, but have liked many movies with leads who weren't at all likable.  Second Everything in this movie seemed real to me.  If there is some proof that anyone has that something was scripted or fake, please let me know.  I watched it all and it seemed like an honest portrayal of one man's quest to find love and make a movie.

Was it a documentary? Was it a student film.  I will say this it was funny.  Some of it was obviously fictional, I just don't know how much.  Was this a doccumentary which was re-edited with some scripted parts to give it pizazz or was it supposed to be this way from the beginning.  It certainly kept me guessing. It wasnt' as good at its press, though it obviously impressed people at Slam Dance.  It doesn't actually have anything to say about dating in Los Angeles, except in repeating the old adage about LA women needing an emotional sky-cap to carry all the baggage they bring with them.  The nebish trying to get a date bit has been done so much better in every one of Woody Allen's films. So why do I like this movie so much? I have no idea.  It's on cable now, so watch it.

This is 80% commentary and at least 5% women complaining about being filmed. There are many pretty women but we hear too little from them, especially not enough that is positive.I admit that I did not pay attention enough to judge whether this is real or not, but it is very, very rare for a movie like this to be real. I watched this movie assuming the characters are acting and I saw nothing that caused me to think otherwise.

The realisation is not so good. The director is not a very talented one, the whole movie has more of an amateur home video. There are only two reasons to watch it At the end of the movie actress Julie McCullough from Growing Pains appears as one of the dates and she bewitches with her natural charme and Tia Carrere from Relic Hunter is the last date. I have seen better amateur videos.
