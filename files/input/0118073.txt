[{"Title":"Funnier than the first one","Date":"3 December 2003","Score":"25 out of 26 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" The Brady Bunch Movie that was released a couple years prior to A Very Brady Sequel was a decent success. The movie was actually pretty funny, I was obsessed with it when I was a kid. As I grew up, there was a flaw that I found with the film, the point of that film was to show how the Brady's were so different from the world and the real life family, no matter what decade. The Brady Bunch Movie was missing one main thing, the reactions from others around them. So A Very Brady Sequel, that's not only what they did, but they did it extremely well and this movie is one of the funniest comedies that you will ever see.One evening, a man claiming to be Carol's long-lost first husband, Roy Martin, shows up at the suburban Brady residence. He is actually a con man named Trevor Thomas and is there to steal their familiar horse statue that is actually a $20 million ancient artifact. They, portrayed as na√Øve, believe his story about suffering from amnesia and having plastic surgery after being injured. Eventually, Trevor's ruse is uncovered by Bobby and Cindy; in retaliation, he kidnaps Carol and takes her and the artifact to a buyer in Hawaii. The remaining Brady family travels to Hawaii to save her and foil his plans.One of the scenes that nearly kills me with laughter each time is when Roy is taking Carol and tells the kids to stay back, Cindy says You can't take my mommy!, Marcia says Cindy's right, take Jan!. You rarely get comedic timing on a joke like that! Roy's reactions to hanging with the Brady family was too funny. I loved when Alice mistakes his mushrooms for actual mushrooms and as he's eating them in the spaghetti she made he realizes that he's tripping with the Brady's. Leading into a very funny cartoon of an acid trip with the Brady's. I thought the touch with Marcia and Greg having a romance was funny since every Brady fan knows that in real life Maureen McCormick and Barry Williams had a little fling, weird seeing brother and sister have that kind of chemistry on camera.A Very Brady Sequel is guaranteed to make you laugh. It's just a fun comedy with a lot of fun pokes at the series. The cast was great and really clicked well. Adding Tim Matheson as Roy was a great idea, he's timing on the jokes was perfect. His character was exactly what these movies needed. I also thought it was a great idea taking on the famous Hawaii episode, how could you not laugh at the way Greg gets wiped out again while surfing? I wish they did make another sequel, but maybe it's better to leave the movies off with a bang, keep us laughing, keep us wanting more because the Brady's can finally rest knowing that they left that audience with a smile on their faces.7/10 "},{"Title":"A Very Underrated Movie","Date":"9 October 2005","Score":"25 out of 28 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" This satiric sequel is a rare exception--it's better than the original. Highlights include Jan's made-up boyfriend, George Glass, Marcia and Greg's awkward sexual attraction, a cameo by Zsa Zsa Gabor and Rosie O'Donnel, not one but TWO musical dance numbers, Marcia's obvious wig in her scene at the pool, Jan losing her contact lens while driving, Mr. and Mrs. Brady's hilariously obvious sexual innuendo, Alice's spaghetti with special mushrooms, the family trip to Hawaii, and the (brief) return of Tiger, the dog. There's a lot more funny stuff too!While the original was all about the Brady's living in the 90s, the sequel is more concerned with the wacky misadventures the characters get themselves into. The comedy is intensified when other non-Brady's (people of the 90s) react to the Brady family. Fortunately, the Brady's are still oblivious to the fact that they aren't living in the 1970's anymore, so we can keep on laughing at the ridiculousness of the situations they are placed in.Honestly, it is such a funny, underrated comedy...RENT IT!

All the actors did well here, especially Shelly Long, Gary Cole, Jennifer Elise Cox and Tim Mathieson. The funny situations, quotes, tone and style of this movie help hide the fact that not all that much really happens and the premise of this film is absurd.One of the biggest questions that fans often had about the show was the taboo subject of whether any of the Brady kids hooked up. A Very Brady Sequel tackles this issue head-on with Greg and Marcia trying to decide whether they should give in to the urges they start to feel for each other. This whole subplot was very interesting, if not also a little uncomfortable at times. Christopher Daniel Barnes and Christine Taylor are great as Greg and Marcia.The one role that I felt was perfectly done and helped the movie out the most is Jennifer Elise Cox as Jan Brady. She does an even better job with the role then the original Jan, Eve Plumb. Almost all the scenes with Jan are funny and Jennifer just shines through.Obviously, fans of The Brady Bunch are going to get the most enjoyment out of this. For a newcomer, you might want to check out a few episodes of the TV show first.

While the original movie was very funny (grunge music nonwithstanding), the total lack of a plot was a pretty obvious hole.This time around we're actually treated to a decent storyline (as relative as can be to the entire Brady aura, that is) involving Mrs. Brady's first, long-lost husband, Roy. This adds a whole additional avenue for laughs as we now have an straight outsider thrust directly into the everyday realm of the Bradys. As he tries to enact his nefarious scheme, he's dragged kicking and screaming through their loopy antics, breakout songs and Mr. Brady's lectures.The same Brady cast returns and they're as spot-on as ever. A bulk of the laughs continue to go to insecure Jan, as she tries to convince everyone she's a viable person. A new incest angle is introduced between Greg and Marcia (Does this mean we're not really brother and sister?) that plays very well throughout. Tim Matheson is an excellent addition as Roy Brady, and he gets some scene stealing parts as well, particularly when he ends up tripping with the Bradys.While Sam seems to have disappeared in this one, we do see a couple of other Brady icons who seemed to have been missed in the first movie, though blink and you'll miss them. Surprisingly no real-life cameos in this one.As with the first movie, the more familiar you are with the TV series the more you will enjoy this movie. If you've never watched the Bradys then you'll probably want to skip these movies as most of the laughs are derived from inside references to the episodes, but if you have, then this is highly recommended and one of my faves.

When the Brady movie came out in 1995, I was thrilled--as the saccharine Brady family was gone and the movie had a wonderful way of making fun of itself. Because of this good-natured lampoon, I was excited to see the sequel--and it did not disappoint--being MUCH better, even, than the previous film.Here, the plot is much sillier and the film is much more daring--going some sick places that the last film never dared. Jan is back--and even crazier than before and simply a hoot. And, there is a totally sick plot involving Marsha and Greg that had me falling on the floor laughing.One of the only reservations about the film is that it, unlike the TV show, there is some family-unfriendly humor. It was very, very funny and welcome...but not for the younguns. The other is that to enjoy and appreciate the film, you really need to have seen the original show. If you never saw the show, you will miss a lot of the references and won't enjoy it nearly as much. So, as a result, here is how I rate the film 9 if you've seen the original show and hated it and 7 if you've never seen it and 2 if you LOVE the original show and can't imagine anyone lampooning this 'pure genius' (yeah, right).The "},{"Title":"A cheerful comedy that is actually funny.","Date":"13 October 2007","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" A sequel that's even better than the first part is a rare occurrence, even more fun than the first film. Once again, it's Jennifer Elise Cox who steals the show with a number of hilarious moments. This overlooked actress has (or had?) the potential to be another Goldie Hawn, but, alas, the major hindrance in her career going forward is that she isn't a Spelling, a Coppola, an Arquette, a Fonda, or a Barrymore. Having lack of powerful family connections is a truly unforgivable crime, and probably a major reason why she didn't make a breakthrough. If Drew Barrymore, for example, had 5% of her talent, she'd be the no.1 female star in the past 2 decades. I don't think much of child and teen actors, but Cox is possibly the funniest teenager I have ever seen in a movie, and one of the funniest actresses, as well. Her semi-retarded, ultra-naive facial expressions, so perfectly suited to this role, and her delivery of lines are absolutely perfect. Matheson is also very good, as is the guy playing the oldest son.

One of the best gags is the uncomfortable incestuous relationship that results from Greg and Marcia sharing their room in the attic. There's also great parodies of the Brady Bunch animated series, bad musical numbers, and the Hawaiian Vacation episode.There are some dud gags as well, but the filmmakers once again took great-- possibly obsessive-- care to replicate the costumes, dialogue, sets, editing, and cinematography of the original Brady Bunch series.

I said in the third verse, And if one day I'm strick-en with cyni-cism. And you look onto this review as not groovy. You can go on to not trust me. After I enjoyed The Brady Bunch Movie. I suppose the same line is valid in this review too. I'm not necessarily proud that I enjoyed both film adaptations, but there are times when we can not help what we liked. Again, from the first frame, I enjoyed the Brady's overwhelming eccentricities.The storyline is pure simplicity; the Brady's are stuck in the seventies while the whole world has kindly shifted into the nineties, therefore, capturing the idea that the Brady's, while timeless, are also pretty outdated. Mike Brady (reprised by Gary Cole) is contemplating what to give his darling gold-haired wife, Carol (Shelley Long) for their anniversary, but in the nick of time, a man claiming to be Carol's first husband named Roy (Tim Matheson) shows up and tries to win Carol back. In reality, he's a snaky con-man, searching for a statue of a marble horse.While the family naively welcomes Roy back home, Greg is hasty about the whole thing, yet never questions if something is really behind this alleged miracle. It is never truly said, however, how Roy managed to know all there was to know about the family, but nevermind that small little detail. The subplots follow other Brady characters, as expected, such as Jan trying to boast to the family about her new boyfriend, George Glass (who is imaginary), Marcia and Peter possibly falling in love, and the family traveling to Hawaii in the latter half of the picture.Again, much like the original film, the whole idea and premise is a little anarchic, but not to the point of utter senselessness. We do not get much in the area of outsider reactions, but we didn't in the first one either, so perhaps it wasn't the filmmaker's prime intent. There are certain pictures we can not help but like, and The Brady Bunch films are two of mine. They're silly, deranged, yet deeply, weirdly satisfying and self-aware - the best part of all.Starring Gary Cole, Shelley Long, Tim Matheson, Henriette Mantel, Christopher Daniel Barnes, Christine Taylor, Paul Sutera, Jennifer Elise Cox, and Jesse Lee Soffer. Directed by Arlene Stanford. "},{"Title":"Very Good Parody of a Very Bad T.V. Show","Date":"11 May 2012","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" First off, it should go without saying that The Brady Bunch was one of the worst, lamest, stupidest shows on television, but it goes without saying, too, that a lot of forty-and- fiftysomethings disagree. That, I think, is pretty much solely because it reminds them of their childhood, when most of them were happier, and had their whole life ahead of them, and any show that they remember watching in their youth, and that has some semblance of the styles, values and attitudes of that era, regardless of how bad the writing is, will do the same thing for them. With dialogue and behavior so brain-damaged it's almost a surreal experience to watch, it's perfect fodder for a satire. It should have been done in the late seventies, of course, a few years after it was cancelled, but better late than never. Unfortunately, these are affectionate satires created by people who seemingly actually liked the show, but they still work because the jokes are so dead-on and they string all the elements of the show together to create simple, entertaining plots. They're actually very campy, which is probably the best way to approach this immaterial material. The sequel, for a change, is the superior of the two. The first one was kind of boring, which is the worst thing a satire can be. The plot of the stolen horse in the sequel is appropriately ludicrous. Christine Taylor as Marcia bears a freakily uncanny resemblance to Maureen McCormick. Olivia Hack creates a classic distortion of Cindy. The only characters that don't quite work are Christopher Daniel Barnes as Greg, using facial mannerisms that parody straight-edge 70's nerds in general but not Greg in particular, and Shelley Long as Carol. There's always something subtly sad and pitiful about Shelly Long's face, voice and mannerisms in everything she's acted in. It works for Jay Pritchett's ex-wife and Diane Chambers, but is precisely wrong for Carol Brady. Her character seems like it thinks deeply and gets depressed, which makes the character too three-dimensional. Tim Matheson as Carol's fake ex-husband is humorously self-serving and unctuous. It's just personal taste, but I found the short-sleeve Banlon shirts he wears in almost every scene really annoying. Zsa Zsa Gabor's cameo was great. I don't see the satirical significance of having Rosie O'Donnell there though. There was one missed opportunity for a good joke. After the scene where Roy has a trip after eating spaghetti in which Alice accidentally put his stash of psychedelic mushrooms, he asks Marsha, Who put the psychedelic mushrooms in the spaghetti? She should have said, Go ask Alice. I think she'll know.

Take Jan!Without a doubt this is the best comic movie of 1996, but one of the best ever. It got nearly all what I need out of a comedy. The pace was the real hero of it; since uniquely the talented lines don't stop throughout the whole thing. This is compared to the first movie&#x85;What first movie ?! Simply this one learned its lesson out of (The Brady Bunch Movie &#x96; 1995). This time it's brighter, faster, and took the irony to the next level. Now the joke is on you Brady people ! Attractively the matter of making fun of the Brady family Look at the hair, the clothes, the constant cheerfulness was a stroke of genius. It's like what if the Brady Bunch came out of the reruns to our present day ?! This great no-time machine matter put them as they are in the middle of our world to live one of the sharpest paradoxes ever between not only the 1970s and 1990s, but also between the polished, so idealistic, American TV once and the reality's taste after 25 years; where the Brady songs would be misplaced, too gay, and annoying ! Or how the 90s's fashions, drugs, or menage a trois would affect the family.. sorry, THIS family! To be generally a brilliant Brady movie and Brady spoof in the same time ! All of that through the situations of the main plot  a fake father (I loved the way he turns into Brady's victim !), stolen statue, kidnapped mother, an adventure to bring her back.. and so on. As you see, the comedy here works on 2 levels (the irony of one out-of-its-time family, and a tale of how this family must get together) and no wonder folks, since one of the movie's makers is (Harry Elfont). He is not a scriptwriter with too many works on him, only too interesting comedies like (Josie and the Pussycats &#x96; 2001) or (Surviving Christmas &#x96; 2004). And I believe (AVBS) is his highest achievements yet.The dialog was crazily funny. OH MY GOD, you can't count the lines that really clicked. And who might forget the dialog of the oldest boy with his fake father about girls, or the one of the mom and the airport's employee (misunderstanding at its top). Let alone the creative and original comic situations (the oldest son searching for his lost mom while surfing, the scene in which we hear all the regretful testimonies even the Brady doll's !). And the performances, OHHH the performances ! For instance  this is the most funny role Christine Taylor ever made, Gary Cole wasn't more droll or charismatic, Shelley Long IS Carol Brady and its perfect parody as well, and how Jennifer Elise Cox could walk while shaking her braids this clever and this goofy ?! I have no idea ! With the short appearances of (John Hillerman) from (Magnum), and (Barbara Eden) from (I Dream of Jeannie), in nearly their famous TV characters, it's more than obvious that it's not a homage to the TV at the 1960s or the 1970s; it's rather a homage to the classic TV as a whole, to reflect unquestionable loyalty and honoring, and refute any supposed toying or disgracing.The average length of shots without laughing = 10 seconds ! It amuses more than any big production comedy with big names. And it delivers even for anyone didn't watch the original TV show too. In one word  it is a classic in despite of any box office or any pedant critic.Finally  Roy  Marcia. Oh, Marcia, Marcia, Marcia. You have grown up to be so gorgeous! / Marcia  I know / Roy  And Jan.

The paper-thin premise of this sequel centers on the appearance of a shady con-man (Tim Matheson) who arrives on the Bradys' doorstep claiming to be Carol's long-lost first husband, who, according to this film's opening scene, was lost at sea. The con-man is really there to get his hands on a statue that has sat in the background of every episode of the TV show and we now learn that it is part of a set and worth a lot of money. But the funniest part of this movie for me is a subplot in which after Roy's arrival, Greg (Christopher Daniel Barnes) and Marcia (Christine Taylor) learn they may not be brother and sister and start lusting after each other. This is, of course, a knowing nod to all those who have read Barry Williams' book GROWING UP BRADY where he confesses to having been madly in love with Maureen McCormick and had trouble looking at her in a sisterly way when they were working. This movie addresses this in a hysterical scene where Greg and Marcia are sharing the room in the attic and start undressing in silhouette. This scene is cleverly shot and perfectly performed by Barnes and Taylor. The rest of the cast has settled comfortably into their roles for this sequel, especially Gary Cole, who is just spooky as Robert Reed as Mike Brady and Jennifer Elise Cox, who steals every scene she is in as Jan. The fun peters out before a truly lame finale, but for true fans, there is fun to be had here.

This time the hideous horse statue (which turns out to be worth $20 million) in the titled family's house is up for grabs by the evil Tim Matheson (who pretends to be Shelley Long's long-lost first husband). The dim-witted family, headed by the boring Gary Cole, once again annoys all around them with their sickening 1960s routine of dressing poorly and singing even worse. All in all if you love the sitcom, sit back and enjoy. 2 stars out of 5.

A Very Brady Sequel is borderline stupidity, which I suppose is the purpose. I'm still trying to figure out if this is a spin-off of the television show, or a parody using the same characters? You could watch the movie and try to figure it out, but quite honestly...it sucks. Don't waste your time. 2/5 stars - "}]
