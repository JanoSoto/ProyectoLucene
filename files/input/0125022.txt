[{"Title":"Good old-fashioned dirty-minded fun, even when Jennifer Love Hewitt isn't on screen.","Date":"20 July 2002","Score":"44 out of 52 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance","Review":"  Director David Mirkin used to write for The Simpsons, which explains why Danny Elfman did the main theme for Heartbreakers - a movie that, success-wise, has more in common with The Greatest TV Show Ever than with Mirkin's earlier Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion, and not just because Shawn Colvin makes a guest appearance here as well. Don't get me wrong, it's not nearly as clever - but it IS often as funny. Plus you get to look at Jennifer Love Hewitt a lot.Mother/daughter grifter duo Sigourney Weaver and JLH are on the verge of splitting up, but agree to do One Last Big Score (isn't it always the way) in order to get out of trouble with the IRS and part sufficiently loaded; Gene Hackman, as a chain-smoking pensionable zillionaire (His liver spots are positively luminous) is their mark in Palm Beach and also the source of a lot of the fun. In fact, he and an under-used Ray Liotta come close to swiping the film from the leads, but Sig and Love make a good team, each complementing the other - Weaver's the better actress, but Hewitt holds her own; and though the former's attractive, the latter - even in her blonde disguise - is smokin' (something the film never forgets - you get to look at Jennifer Love Hewitt a lot).The Robert Dunn/Paul Guay/Stephen Mazur script won't win plaudits from the PC brigade; Heartbreakers is often a farce in a good sense, but the female characters come off for the most part not as morally upright as their male counterparts (though Hackman's moneybags is by far the most repellent person here). Pacy for sure, and often funny if not always in what the late British DJ Kenny Everett's Cupid Stunt character called the best possible taste (witness the oral sex gags early on), there's a distinct slowing down as the tale unfolds and Jen's growing feelings for a potential mark (Jason Lee) makes it more sentimental than cynics would like; the first half of the movie is funnier and edgier than the second. But you get to look at Jennifer Love Hewitt a lot.In the end, Heartbreakers has a tone a bit too much like the likes of Are You Being Served? to be a must-view for all; the movie sometimes comes across like a Carry On film. Only with a budget. And good performances. And decent writing. And funny. And with a fine soundtrack. Okay, so it's not much like a Carry On film, but it does make for a good two hours' watching; Weaver fans will get a particular kick out of her rendition of Back In The U.S.S.R., and Hackman fans will enjoy seeing him upstage everyone except for Hewitt's anatomy; I gave this 7 out of 10, but I should have given this an 8 purely on that count. This is one movie that lives up to its title.And did I mention you get to look at Jennifer Love Hewitt a lot?

Heartbreakers is a delightful comedy that proves how deceitful a clever woman can be,as Weaver demonstrates as the gorgeous and alluring Max Conners,who targets wealthy gentleman,walks them down the aisle,and then empties their pockets through divorce when she discovers that they have eyes for other women.But the amusing thing about this film is that the other women is Max's sexy younger daughter Page,and she can turn just as many heads as her mother.Unknown to her husbands,Page is trained to seduce them,helping her mother get out of her newest marriage with a few bucks in her pocket,and the freedom to put more foolish men under her spell.Ray Liotta is hilarious as Dean,and Vinnie Stagliano,the ex husband of Max,who is bitter and desperate for revenge when he discovers how much of a bitch his ex wife is.Meanwhile,Page believes she could just as easily lure men into marriage like her mother,and sets her sights on Jack Withroe (Jason Lee)a bar owner who falls in love with her,unaware of her game.But the plot really gets interesting when we learn that Page has a heart and is in love with Jack.The ending is exciting,enjoyable and romantic.Heartbreakers is a fun film for the females,with plenty of eye candy and cleavage for the males!

The results are mixed (but mostly good), with some terrific slapstick and some pure drivel.  Maxine (Sigourney Weaver) and Paige (Jennifer Love Hewitt) are two very slick con artists who find rich patsies and marry them, only to divorce them for big settlements after enticing them into indiscretions.  When they get nabbed by the IRS for not paying their taxes, they must score one more time to climb out of their financial mess.  The target is chain smoking billionaire William B. Tensy (Gene Hackman) who is dying before our eyes of lung disease.  The only question is whether Maxine can get him to propose before he keels over.  Meanwhile, Paige is running her own scam on Jack (Jason Lee) who owns a bar resting on prime real estate worth $3 Million.It is mostly pratfall humor, with lots of sight gags and general nuttiness, which is often uproariously funny.  The whole idea that the diminutive Paige could have been spawned from the Amazonian Maxine is implied comedy at its finest, leading us to conclude that Paige's father could only have been a midget.Gene Hackman completely steals the show as the wheezy billionaire.  Hackman, who is one of our national treasures as a dramatic actor, shows magnificent range, and he turns out to be the best comedian of the bunch.  Sigourney Weaver is also in rare form brandishing some bodacious outfits and undergarments.  She is especially funny as Olga, trotting out impressive broken English and even doing some vocals accompanied by a Russian balalaika band.  Ray Liotta gives a lighthearted and funny performance as a chop shop owner who can't get over his love for Maxine, even though he knows she scammed him.  Jason Lee's understated nice guy portrayal serves as the perfect counterpart to Jennifer Love Hewitt's bratty vamp.  The perennially cute Hewitt still can't seem to transition into grownup roles.  No matter how sexy they make her up (and they do quite a good job with her considerable attributes), her pubescent mannerisms and delivery still make her come off as a teenage harpy.  In her defense, this is what the role required, but it doesn't do much to move her out of her character rut.Overall, there is a lot of good fun here that is often dissipated by puerile absurdity.  Still, there are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, mostly delivered by Weaver and Hackman, that make this a better than average comedy.  I rated it 7/10.  Fans who like seeing Sigourney and Jennifer in sexy outfits will not be disappointed.

Directed by David Mirkin. Written by Robert Dunn, Paul Guay, and Stephen Mazur. Produced by John Davis and Irving Ong. Rated PG-13 (for sexual content and language). Released by MGM Productions.It is becoming a genuine tradition for movies with sexy stars and seductive content to believe that males of all ages view the world not with their brain, but with the external organ between their legs. Heartbreakers does a convincing job at persuading us to agree, if we guy audience members can ourselves get past the ample amounts of cleavage and sexy dialogue inhabiting by this PG-13 rated comedy that contains enough suggestive material and revealing midriffs for many parents to pause over. The film is another mother-daughter story about letting your children grow up-but disguised itself as a hilarious comedy about sensuous swindlers who make their own luck. It makes us laugh because of the irony of its situations, and it makes us smile because of the knowledge of the writing by Robert Dunn, Paul Guay, and Stephen Mazur. Heartbreakers is easily one of the funniest comedies of the year.The film stars Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love-Hewitt as Max and Page, two conniving con artists who use their good looks to get what they want. As the movie opens, Max is married to small-time Jersey womanizer Dean Cumanno (Ray Liotta), but the marriage is short lived when Max shows up at his office the next day only to find her newlywed fooling around with an attractive younger woman-her daughter, Page. The whole act was a setup for a abrupt and easy divorce settlement, with the two double-dealers coming away from the act with their pockets overloaded with three-hundred thousand dollars and a really nice car.Page is growing up and wants to start a business on her own, but her mother thinks she is not yet ready and finds them both in a demanding circumstance the IRS needs lots of money real soon from Max and Page. A spiteful agent (Anne Bancroft) explains that their accounts have been drained and criminal charges are about to be pursued. Page coincides to help her mother with one last job in order to pay off the alleged debts. They find the perfect target in Palm Beach, an aging tobacco exec named William B. Tensy (Gene Hackman), who is worth over twenty million. Although neither Page or Max find this smelly chain smoking, old man particularly attractive, Max poses as a Russian aristocrat named Ulga Yevanova, while Page finds her way with Tensy as a revealing housekeeper for his local mansion.This last job ultimately poses a few problems for Max and Page. Max finds herself followed  by Dean, who seeks another martial bliss. Page finds herself falling in love with the kind-hearted owner of a local bar (Jason Lee), who is worth three million dollars. Max wants her to go for his pocketbook, but Page really has feelings for this person-even though romance is against her better judgment. The two must decide how to deal with these situations, all while persuading Tensy to further fall for Max in attempt to pay off the IRS.Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sigourney Weaver deliver performances that are both sexy and funny. They are also very well cast; making perfect and believable mother-daughter chemistry. There are also some funny performances from the strong supporting cast. Gene Hackman makes a fool out of himself with a character on the other side of the world from anything he has recently done. The charismatic young actor Jason Lee (Almost Famous, Mumford) furnishes a convincing romantic interest-although there is little chemistry between Hewitt and him. Anne Bancroft (The Graduate, Great Expectations) fits in with the crowd gleefully. Other small roles from Jeffrey Jones (The Devil's Advocate, Sleepy Hollow) as a hotel manager and Nora Dunn (Three Kings) as a maid framed for house robbing her own employer, are also entertaining.Director David Mirkin struck out with the 1997 comedy Romy and Michele's High School Reunion, but here captures the perfect tone for the comic material. Hearty laughs are frequent and big-and it takes a lot to make melaugh. The film prospers with a script that provides its amusing characters with many active situations and plot twists that are unanticipated and effective. Eventually, however, the film becomes rapped up in a sappy love story that somewhat gets in the way of the comedy. The movie's tone becomes a little too serious, and we end up feeling cheated out of even more boisterously entertaining moments.When it comes to getting tons of laughs out of the audience, the film prospers with no problems. Hewitt and Weaver make great career moves, especially after they each tried their strings with failed serious films (Weaver's past several Alien movies have bombed, and Hewitt could not do a thing with I Still Know What You Did Last Summer). Heartbreakers contains enough effective comic material to warrant more than a single viewing. It is one of the best comedies of the year.

Yes, the con is on, as mom takes &#145;em to the altar, daughter seduces &#145;em (getting caught in the act by mom, of course), and mom settles for a divorce and some big bucks.  For the women, it's like having the goose that laid the golden egg, and all is going well; the bucks are rolling in and Cupid's path is being littered in their wake with the carnage of the men they've despoiled.  Then Page (Hewitt), much to the chagrin of her mother, Angela (Weaver), decides it's time to strike out on her own and take down a score for herself.  But as fate, luck, chance or what-have-you would have it, at that moment the IRA steps in and not only wipes out their bank account, but hands them a bill for back taxes that far and away exceeds the amount already confiscated.  At that point, what's a girl to do, but find another mark.  Only this time, it has to be one rich beyond their wildest dreams.  And with that, the hunt is on.	An amusing, and at times hilarious comedy, the fact that it works as well as it does can be attributed to two things, by category  Weaver and Hewitt; and Ray Liotta and Jason Lee.  For what the movie lacks in originality is made up for with the performances of the aforementioned four.  As far as the women, such a pair of femmes fatales you've never seen; Hewitt has it and flaunts it, but she's still overshadowed by the gorgeous Weaver.  Looks aside, however, what really makes it cook is their shared if-you-see-me-comin'-better-step-aside, take-no-prisoners attitude, a Mae West meets Kate Hepburn persona that gives their con its zing.  Weaver plays it to the hilts, saucy, seductive and sharp as a tack.  And not to be outdone by her co-star, Hewitt stays right there with her, by giving a performance that makes you believe that this is a young woman who could actually pull this stuff off.  Together, their antics on screen are reminiscent of Lemmon and Curtis in `Some Like It Hot,' or Caine and Martin in `Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.'  There's a refreshing lack of pretentiousness about them that really makes them fun to watch.	As for the guys, Liotta gives a sharp performance as Dean, a guy with a hard edge and a soft spot for Angela, and Lee does a notable turn as Jack, a regular guy who finds himself in the eye of Angela and Page's storm.  Lee has an especially engaging screen presence, and some of the most memorable moments of the film are in the scenes he shares with Hewitt. 	Last, but far from least, Gene Hackman scores some guffaws as billionaire tobacco magnate William Tensy.  He gets a bit tongue-in-cheek with his character, who with his tobacco stained teeth and smoker's cough is at the same time hilarious and repulsive.  When Angela demurs his attempted kiss, you'd swear you can smell his breath and the reek of smoke from his clothes.  And you have to give Hackman credit for this one, because to play this role all vanity had to be stuffed in the closet for the duration. 	The supporting cast includes Anne Bancroft (Barbara), Jeffrey Jones (Mr. Appel), Nora Dunn (Miss Madress), Julio Oscar Mechoso (Leo), Carrie Fisher (Mrs. Surpin), Ricky Jay (Dawson's Auctioneer) and Elya Baskin (Vladimir).  Director Mirkin must be given credit for his imaginative approach to some fairly unoriginal material, and for making up for it's lack of substance by extracting some top performances from his actors.  The real strength of `Heartbreakers,' however, is the fact that it never takes itself too seriously.  If you look deep enough, you may find some insight into human nature, but for the most part this is a movie that was made with nothing but fun in mind.  It's entertaining, there's some laughs and some nice moments, and it's easy on the eyes.  If you let it, it's a movie that will let you off the hook for awhile and show you a good time.  And for my money, that's not such a bad deal.  I rate this one 7/10.

It is so good that there are not superlatives enough to do it credit.  The basic setup is that the principal characters, a mother, tantalizingly portrayed by Weaver, and her daughter, multifacetedly portrayed by Hewett, are artistes confidence to the core of their superficial existences.  They cannot so much as have lunch without practicing their arts of the scam, but mainly they work the old betrothal game.  Mom gets her rich mark to the alter, then even before the marriage can be consummated, the daughter, pretending to be unrelated, exploits the man's foolish libido, resulting in a substantial settlement after mom catches them apparently in flagrante.  But then things start going haywire when the daughter decides to strike out on her own, because the guy she fixes on as a mark is not like other guys at all.  How he is not, and how her character develops as a result, makes for two hours of outstanding comedy and drama.

This way only gets them so far, when, fresh of such a con with Ray Liotta, their hard earned cash is taken right out of their hands from their dear friends the IRS, and they decide to target the big guns in the form of multi-billionaire Gene Hackman.With a tacky premise such as this, it may seem somewhat of an embarrassment to have some talents (and Jennifer Love-Hewitt) involved. But it pays off surprisingly well. Heartbreakers is not a film that tries to be revolutionary in any way, just good entertainment, and that it is. Weaver is hilarious as the old-age goldigger, and Gene Hackman coughs and curses appropriately through his carcinogenic, repulsive richman. But for quality comedic turns, the best is by Ray Liotta, as the resentful ex who refuses to forgive and forget, who apes his own GoodFellas turn, freaky style, with laugh-out-loud consequences. From the younger actors, Jennifer Love-Hewitt is less capable, her constant bitchy act getting somewhat annoying. Her love interest, played by Chasing Amy's Jason Lee, is more likable, utterly adorable in his naivety and dedication (some would say stupidity) to his wretched girlfriend, who originally only pretends to be interested in him for his money, but ends up falling for him.I'd like to think that Heartbreakers had set out to be more than a generic comedy, and to be a film with a few lessons to teach about love. However, in its 2 hours, it ends up using the standard template. Girls tricks boy, girl falls in love with boy, girl regrets mistake, etc. For that, the film seems pretty average. There are severe plot holes and thinly sketched characters too, plus the fact that the women's aspirations can fall from billions to millions in the space of seconds &#150; it just doesn't make sense. There are additional problems that blaze out so obviously that they are impossible to ignore. But for the most part, this is a superior romantic comedy, with some excellent moments. A key one is when Weaver, keen to prove that she is, ahem, Russian, does her rendition of The Beatles' Back in U.S.S.R. There are some snappy one-liners, amusing physical comedy (Gene Hackman dying never seemed so funny). The direction is nothing special, but the stars raise their mediocre material and aim for comedy heaven, often reaching it, in a deeply entertaining, sometimes sweet, movie.

It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World from back in the 60's (I watched as a repeat in later years) and Young Frankenstein.Ray Liota missed his calling. He is wasting his time always playing a bad guy or thug. He should really be concentrating on comedy. For me he stole the movie. Maybe because I wasn't expecting him to be so spot on with his timing and his facial expressions.Sometimes the music in a movie misses the mark but this time it really enhanced a scene. I highly recommend it. It was such a pleasure to watch a movie that didn't have gratuitous sex or nudity or over the top foul language. It was just fun and this movie relies on writing and acting to carry it and not nudity, sex and vulgarity.

Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt star as a mother and daughter con-team. They are like the legacy hunters of Ancient Rome, following around wealthy men in order to get their money. Their usual scam involves Max (Weaver) seducing a man, then marrying him. Then Page (Hewitt) appears and makes him unfaithful so that Max can divorce him and get half his money. The film begins with such a scam, taking mechanic Ray Liotta for a ride. Max is annoyed though with their slim pickings, and Page claims she can move out on her own. They decide to go for one last score each, to see who can earn the most. Max sets her sights on aging Billionaire Tensey, played by Hackman and Page follows Bartender Jason Lee who is also rich. However, Page falls for Lee and Max realises she may lose her daughter, as well as Tinsey's fortune as he refuses to die. Also, Liotta has found the two and realised their plans. He wants his money back...Although this starts out as quite a dark and cynical comedy it soon becomes more light-hearted and typical fare. There remains though a subtle tone of skepticism throughout which is refreshing in a genre which rarely offers any originality, or entertainment. Each actor seems to enjoy themselves fully, some being pulled widely away from the characters they usually play. Weaver is very strong and in control, Hewitt is extremely sexy rather than her usual roles involving screaming, crying or cuteness, and she does very well. Liotta is excellent giving the best jokes in the film, Hackman is also very funny, and Jason Lee, though toned down from his Kevin Smith roles is still capable of getting our laughs and sympathy. You can usually buy this pretty cheap so it would hardly be a waste, better than most of its type but unfortunately it is a type which is limited. Overall, good fun.7 out of 10 "},{"Title":"This is almost worth going to see just because of Jennifer Love Hewitt!","Date":"12 May 2002","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance","Review":"  Much to my surprise, this movie is actually very funny and entertaining! It's about a mother/daughter con team of Max and Page (played by Sigourney Weaver of `Aliens' and Jennifer Love Hewitt of `Can't Hardly Wait') who prey upon wealthy men with the mom as bait and the daughter as cheating material to end the marriage in a fraudulent divorce. Therefore, they get half of everything he owns, which tides them over until the next poor sucker is tracked down. And these are supposed to be the good guys (or girls)? Just like `Hannibal', you end up rooting for the main characters, regardless of their motives. While this seems to work fine for them on a rich chop shop owner named Dean (Ray Liotta of `Goodfellas') and tobacco tycoon William Tensy (Gene Hackman of `Enemy of the State'), they run into a unexpected problem when Page falls for a bar owner named Jack (Jason Lee of `Chasing Amy') and actually grows a conscience on their supposed `last con'. Meanwhile, Dean tracks the two down and uncovers their scam. Due to the hilarious performances by Liotta and Hackman, and the amazing turn for Hewitt (from the dreadful `Party of Five'), this movie stayed on track and kept the laughs rolling. While this could've fizzled in so many spots, it managed to turn itself into one of the most surprisingly enjoyable comedies in a while, possibly due to director David Mirkin's (Romy and Michele's High School Reunion') fast-paced, yet lighthearted touch.

In fact, maybe it's fair to say that in the second half he made this film. I have to seriously re-think my Liotta-o-meter. When all's said and done, he doesn't need to get home brain surgery to entertain me.Jennifer spent a lot of screen time without contributing much, but I'd blame that on the script, not on her.

Hewitt lighting up will undoubtedly appeal to smoking fetishists, but the film ironically manages to turn in an anti-tobacco message with Gene Hackman looking like death warmed over as a truly repellant cigarette manufacturer. Sigourney Weaver takes a break from the Alien movies to display her more feminine side; her rendition of Back in the USSR is a comic gem. Hackman is brilliant as always, even when playing a nauseating character. Ray Liotta does a funny parody of his Goodfellas persona as the wise guy with a heart of gold, and Jason Lee plays Hewitt's mark who becomes her true love. Look for super-hot Sarah Silverman as one of Lee's pals and folk singer Shawn Colvin as a minister. The perfect movie for long winter nights, I love this film!

A scantily clad Jennifer Love Hewitt is a bit irritating as a vampish daughter who can't make up her mind whether to pursue Jason Lee or not. Lee seems willing to take whatever he can get from her, regardless of her abusive treatment.Much of it is very amusing if you can accept the fact that none of the characters are exactly likeable.

Unfortunately, this movie can't decide on that. The story follows a mother and daughter who professionalize in being con artists. Their specialty - seducing, marrying and divorcing men into giving them the majority of their money. This would be funny if the film's main characters had focused on a man they had dealt with in the past but no. They decide to take on the everyday guy just for the sake of getting quick money. This is not how it should be done. This should be a revenge comedy against one man, not the entire gender universally.What's even more astonishing is the wide scale range that the casting department chose for their actors. The mother and daughter are played by Sigourney Weaver (the Alien (1979) franchise) and Jennifer Love Hewitt (I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997)) respectively. There's Ray Liotta (Unlawful Entry (1992)), Jason Lee (who would later play Syndrome in The Incredibles (2004)), Jeffrey Jones from Beetlejuice (1988), Gene Hackman from Superman (1978), Zach Galifianakis (from the Hangover (2009) franchise) and even Carrie Fisher from Star Wars (1977) is acting in here. How could such a large cast of good actors still make such an average film?In fact, a lot of these actors' scenes are wasted because they are similar to other characters they have played. Weaver is probably the most complex but also the character with the on-off conscious. Hewitt plays the confused girl not knowing what to think of her emotions. Liotta continues to play his usual violent egomaniac, although there is a scene where he even grows a conscious (briefly); that scene I enjoyed the most. And Jason Lee just plays the clueless cutie boy who has no idea what's going on around him. As for the rest of the cast mentioned before, they really do have wasted scenes. None of them are funny scenes either.It just doesn't make sense. You have director David Mirkin, who has worked with comedies before like The Simpsons (1989) and the same name titled movie of 2007. Maybe it's his lack of directing features that pass 30 minutes. He's only released one other theatrical film, maybe he wasn't ready? And how come three writers couldn't form a more consistent plot. So much of it is back and forth between what is right and wrong which becomes tiresome. It will make people want to tell the characters to make a decision already. And it's not like they couldn't make a good script. Two of these writers were apart of Liar Liar (1997) which many people consider a good movie (speaking of which that that movie was also related to lying). Hmmm.Anyway, so it's not easy to say who is the weak link here. John Debney's music was OK. It had goofy tunes, which did alright in helping the scenes, but still didn't help the consistency of the tone. The comedy was also very bland. The main actors don't give much charm to their characters. Sure they dress up and talk like other people but that doesn't always make them funny. Some viewers may also find it sexist of how it portrays both genders. Men are lustful and dumb, while women are seductive and calculative. Then again, it can also be taken as an empowering portrayal. It really depends on what the audience wants to see. I for one found nothing of either side except an average comedy that had a little promise but didn't accomplish much.For a comedy with such a strong cast, it seems like this could have audiences laugh a lot. Sadly, the characters are too cliché and the tone flip flops making it just an average movie.

That one had two all-time comedic masters in Steve Martin and Michael Caine working. This one has two actresses who dabbles in comedies. In that one, it wasn't the cons but the wacky antics that was important. No matter how hard they try, nobody can do physical comedy in the same league.Gene Hackman plays a gruff tobacco magnate. He's not a terribly funny comedian. Jason Lee plays the bar owner who falls for Hewitt. I can't fault anybody for the attempt, but I just don't see much in the mean-spirited personality to like.

Typically I don't say that about her&#x85;she tends to go after roles that are aggressive, and more manly&#x85;but she was funny and entertaining to watch. Jennifer Love Hewitt was your typical spoiled brat, that fell in love with the man she was trying to con out of money. Gene Hackman played an ugly old (loaded) smoker&#x85;and may I say, he played the dying old rich man well, lol. The movie was funny, exciting, and romantic. I currently own this movie and will be delighted to watch it again in the near future. I do recommend this movie.For daily movie reviews visit kimsmoak.com now!

Ray Liotta portrayed the crook with a heart of gold who would do anything to win back the girl of his dreams Jason Lee as bar tender Jack was both genuine and sweet. One of my favorite scenes is when Page falls asleep on the bed and begins to cry it's then shown that she really loves this nice guy.Max (Weaver) & Page (Hewitt) Conners are a sexy mother/daughter con artist team who make men fall in love then break their hearts and steal their cash. The latest con is on Dean Cummano (Liotta) a small crook and car shop owner, she marries him and then Page seduces him into a bad situation prompting Max to quickly divorce and take what he's got. Now that Page is older she's ready to set up on her own but her mother doesn't think she's ready . When the I.R.S. threatens to sue them for tax evasion and fraud Max begs her daughter to help her with one last con, The final candidate is William B. Tensy (Hackman) a tobacco company owner worth $20 million. However complications arise when Page sets her sights on Jack Withrowe (Lee) a bar tender whose property is worth $3 million dollars, she genuinely begins to fall in love with him while Max posing as Ulga Yevonova a Russian beauty is being followed by Dean who wants a second trip down the aisle. Filled with humor, laughter and heartwarming romance Heartbreakers is the ultimate hilarious romantic comedy for everyone.

And putting a actress such a Sigourney Weaver to play the con artist, the director or the writer probably thought the audience would actually root for her and her scheme. But besides the film portraying these two con artists as the not so bad girls being beyond me, it was actually pretty entertaining. I mean it's nothing to go rush out and see and Jennifer Love Hewitt was hottest she has ever been and the supporting cast did a decent job as well although not as hot as Love Hewitt. The plot and the character interaction is way over the top although it was probably for some comedic value, again okay film to check out if you have few hours to kill, just don't take the film seriously and you will be alright.7.3/10 "},{"Title":"Do you have any idea how much therapy you people need?","Date":"11 August 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance","Review":" Max and Page are mother and daughter, they also happen to be a brilliant con team. Max lures wealthy men into marrying her, then Page seduces the just married guys into cheating so Max can fleece them in the divorce court. But this time it's not so simple, Dean refuses to give up on his marriage and goes in hot pursuit of Max. But that's not all. The girls are in conflict as Page wants to go her own way, whilst the next two men in each of their lives are literally going to turn their world's upside down.As everyone knows by now, taste and opinions are subjective, none more so than when it comes to comedy in all its various forms. That said, I'm personally surprised that Heartbreakers doesn't have more of a following since it's got a little bit of everything to make it a comedic winner. The cast are working hard and enjoying the material, there's loads of sex appeal for both members of the opposite sex, and crucially, it's very much pinging with moments of hilarity. The ending is perhaps never much in doubt, and yes it's going to be too sweet for some, but preparing for a formula ending whilst having a laugh on the way is, I think, all one can expect from a production such as this.Sigourney Weaver, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Ray Liotta and Gene Hackman lead the way. Playing mother and daughter, both Weaver & Hewitt delight in their willingness to vamp it up for their characters. And boys, there are legs, oh yes, lovely long legs. Liotta as the lovelorn and recently cash departed Dean is wonderful. Revelling in a comedy role away from his macho image, his timing matched with his incredulity makes one wish that he had done far more comedy in his career. And girls, if you like Liotta in that way, you are well served here. Especially in one laugh out loud kinky sequence. Then there is Gene Hackman playing the latest target for being stripped of his cash. As an old and crusty tobacco magnate, Hackman disgusts as much as he amuses, and he too looks to be having a right good old time.Zippy one line zingers and visual treats along the way, Heartbreakers holds up on revisits. It obviously isn't comedy genius with a deep cranial worth, but it's slinky, sexy and dam well funny. Give it a go and you may just be surprised. 7.5/10 "},{"Title":"A hilarious film with a good cast.","Date":"8 August 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance","Review":" Heartbreakers is a hilarious comedy that I will not soon forget.

Like comedian Sarah Silverman and Zach Galifanakis from The Hangover. Heartbreakers was probably my favorite film of 2001. Mostly because it's such a well thought out movie and it's hilarious. Also, I found Jennifer Love Hewitt sexy like always. I did leave out the performance by Gene Hackman as an old guy the two women plan on conning. Heartbreakers is a genius comedy. I know that the two main characters are bitches, but that doesn't ruin a film. The two main characters are supposed to be conning these men, and it works.The Plot A mother and daughter are conning men for the last time.

Of course I've seen Jennifer Love Hewitt many times since 2001, and every time I've seen her, she's been a stick, so I still don't get all the hoopla about how she looks in a swimsuit. She has always been a spectacular looking young woman.That's not really beside the point - this is a film about mother and daughter con artists who make their money in a variety of ways, all illegal. Mom Max (Weaver) marries 'em, daughter Page (Hewitt) seduces 'em, mom catches 'em and gets a huge divorce settlement without ever having sex with a husband -she claims her religion dictates she wait until the wedding night, and then on the wedding night, she unceremoniously falls asleep after getting the guy raring to go. So raring that when he sees the daughter's boobs and legs that go up to her neck, he's ready to pounce.But there are other cons. There's the fall on the wet hotel floor which gets them a free suite; the glass in the salad that gets them a free meal, and out and out stealing. In one scene, while a man is filling the gas tank, Page (Hewitt) takes his credit card, inserts it at her tank on the other side, and replaces it on his side, filling her tank on his money. These women are pros.After the two con mobster Liotta, Page announces she wants to go out on her own. Then, believing that the IRS has wiped them out and wants more money, she agrees to stay with her mother for one last con - and it has to be a huge one. Heading for Palm Beach, they have to decide on two men - one decrepit billionaire (Gene Hackman) and a young bachelor Jack Winthrowe (Lee). After Max wins a bet, the target becomes chain-smoking, constantly coughing Tensy (Hackman). Unbeknownst to mom at first, Page goes after Jack. Then the unexpected happens.This is a very funny movie with some great scenes, one of the best being when Max, posing as a Russian, is forced to get up on stage and sing in Russian. Weaver is simply great in this role, not to mention outrageously beautiful and sexy. I asked my mother how old she thought Weaver was, and she answered Thirty. I said, Mom, she's exactly my age. She used to have the voice lesson after mine in New York. She was tall and beautiful then; she was tall and beautiful in 2001, and she's tall and beautiful now. Hewitt is both sexy and trashy, playing the role of a young woman tough on the outside and a marshmallow on the inside very well.Very enjoyable and entertaining, with some excellent performances.

However I was quite taken by this one - not quite Oscar material, but she definitely makes this movie.Even with the solid sterling cast of Liotta, Weaver, Bancroft, Lee and Hackman this movie could easily have become a little tedious and lack-lustre. What tips it to just short of excellence, and brings it to life, is Ms Hewitt, in one of the most captivating performances I've witnessed from this delectable young lady.I would have like to see a little more spark between Hewitt and the also very-watchable Jason Lee, but they play the humorous side very well indeed. There are some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments in this film - sadly not enough, but Hackman and a bird provide one of the best.I'm glad I ignored my first impressions and stuck with it, and even if you don't love Hewitt, I still recommend it to anyone who wants to relax and be thoroughly entertained and amused. Great performances from a very talented cast, some great lines, and suitable for all audiences.

The premise and overall mood of the story is meant to be fun and fluffy, like a party or rainy day film. You cannot possibly see this film in the same light as other classics. That is not its purpose. It's meant to be like any other romantic comedy. But, it has an added twist with its originality.The veterans (Weaver, Hackman, Liotta) are knock-outs with a great sense of timing and wonderful shtick. The teenagers (Hewitt, Lee) have more to learn, but are still likable.If you liked Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, you'll like this. Weaver posing as a Russian and her scenes with Hackman & Liotta are the funniest in the movie.This was my first DVD upon getting my player two years ago, and I still enjoy watching this movie time and again.

There are no bad guys in this movie because even the main characters themselves aren't so good. There are just a bunch of likable interesting people interact and helplessly make a bad situation worse by just being who they are. And yet we know that no matter how bad things get (and things become very bad near the end), they still manage to wrap it up in a happy ending in a believable (almost) way. The background music is great, the view is spectacular. The humor started out being on the realistic side, then go down to sitcom, then went so crazy, it's almost like a spoof. Not that it's a bad thing. But the inconsistency may turn some people off. But don't worry, it is funny. And this isn't a teen comedy funny. This is a very sophisticated, adult, yet light hearted kind of funny (think Seinfeld and Friends). Plus, it's also very refreshing because there are tons of original stuffs in here. Very clever.

I have seen some other movies where actors have to speak in English or other accents, Weaver is the best.Even though we all know that it is not real life, but screenplay writer did an excellent job so that everything is very logical. For example, I was wondering myself how the fake IRS woman gets into Weaver's account, etc. Then later on, the movie revealed its answer. Of course, there is one minor mistake.

I have been dying to see a great comedy film like this one in well over 12 months.heartBREAKeRS is an hilarious hit comedy about a mother and daughter who team up in order to separate the men from their money! Max and Page are brilliant con artist who have their gift down to a fine science. First Max targets a wealthy, willing man who falls prey to her beauty and charm. Then once Max and the marked man have tied the knot, the seductive page appears&#133;. So does max have time to &#145;catch' her wayward husband in the act! From there it's off to divorce with the hapless hubby losing much more than just his shirt! The script of heartBREAKeRS was in my opinion very very clever and funny. Having a mother and daughter teaming up to rip the heart out of various men was a great script to write. Much of he credit for this film must go to director David Mirkin, because I feel he got the story just right. This movie is good on two levels. One is the mean bitchy level where the girls just use the men they see. Then you have the beautiful love story between Page and Jake, and how they are meant to be together. The setting that David chose for this film was an extremely good as it suited the film just right.The stars of this movie are very good. With veteran actors such as Sigourney Weaver and Gene Hackman, they made this cast one to remember. Then you also get to see the younger side of acting with the gorgeous Jennifer Love Hewitt. Her role was especially memorable because of the way she turned herself around, from being the mean and nasty girl on the side, to the caring loving wife. Sigourney Weaver's role of the evil woman who uses every man she gets was also great to watch. I still love her role in the &#145;Ghostbusters' as well.I must commend the male stars of the show, including Ray Liotta as one of the guys being used by the evil pair. I remember his role in that sick film, Hannibal, boy it was good to see him in a comedy role. His line of `you are both evil sluts' was just a classic. Hackman was impressive as the rich old fool.  He has had an impressive career, with his success as Lex Luthor in the Superman movies and in such hi profile films as Enemy of the state, The Mexican and The Quick and the Dead. The other actor who I thought was very good, with his character being a complete gentleman was Jason Lee. I have seen him in many ordinary comedies such as  Chasing Amy and Mallrats, yet he has done some great films in the last few years, such as Vanilla Sky and Enemy of the State. I look forward to seeing him in more movies in the next few years.This movie while it is very funny and has some great actors in it, I see a great message for people to take away from it. Relationships are important and need to be treated that way, not like some cheap experience that a person has to get a bit of money from. All in all this movie was a film that I can learn from, yet laugh at. If you want to be heartBROKeN, then have a look at this great comedy.

However, since I am married, I do have to sit through the odd one every now and again. Tonight, when my wife rented this one from the video store, I was ready to run from the room. However, since I have not spent alot of time with her all week, I thought I better sit still and bear with it. I was very suprised. Heartbreakers is definately one of the best romantic comedies that I have ever seen. The story revolves around a mother and daughter team (Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt), who make a living out of marrying men, and then conning them out of there money. After conning Ray Liotta, the women find that all the money that they have stolen over the years has been taken by the IRS. Desperate, the two of them head out to Florida for the one final big score. There, they find a wealthy old man (Gene Hackman), who is a self made billionaire through the tobacco industry. Once again, the women try to seduce him to get to his money. However, trouble arises, as Ray Liotta's character decides to go after mom.This romantic comedy is as predictable as them all. However, credit goes to Gene Hackman (who really does hack in this role!), as this is one of the funniest performances that he has done in a long time. Hackman is just brilliant as the perverted Tobacco giant, who wants nothing more than to bed Sigourney Weaver's character.And let's talk about Sigourney Weaver. This woman just looks better and better every year that she ages. She fills the screen with her sexy character. And let's not forget about Jennifer Love Hewitt. She is just a knockout in this film. God bless the mini skirt!Guys, if you are looking for a movie to watch with your wife, girlfriend, lover, etc., definately pick up Heartbreakers. The girls will love you for watching one of their chick flicks, while you get to look at two women that are definately not hard to look at. Plus, Hackman and Liotta fill this picture with just enough machismo for you. So, if it's your wife's turn to pick out a movie...pick out Heartbreakers. You will not be disappointed.

Please pardon my imperfect English.*** Contains Spoilers ***Own OpinionI am not a friend of romantic comedys (at least modern ones) and the sole reason to watch this one was Sigourney Weaver starring in it (the rest of the cast was unknown to me, so I am not biased about them). Her performance is great (as to be expected) but this is at the same time an inner weakness of the movie. She emanates just too much power and overexpands the fabric(for a comedy it is deadly if the viewer thinks 'Oh no, that's for real'). The second problem is that she always looked more mature (and therefore older) than her age, she could nearly be the mother of husband #13 (Liotta) (on the other hand that makes her the right partner for Hackman). This and the permanent change of pace (and mood) result in an imbalance. The makers have considerable problems to disentangle the countless twists without exceeding the timeframe. So on the whole I would not name this a great film but it is still enjoyable. I think I will buy it, when (if?) there will be a Region 2 DVD available. I agree with those critics saying that the film has a bitter undertone, so I can understand why a lot of people felt uncomfortable with it.Criticizing criticsA lot of reviewers said that the plot is predictable. Did you ever see a movie in a fixed genre without knowing exactly what would happen ? It's called conventions. Somebody compared it with comedys from the 30ies (>oldfashioned). Considering what is sold as 'comedy' today, this is praise not dispraise (I already mentioned that I don't like the typical modern garbage). One critic said that it was like 'Mars Attacks' and that would meanStars instead of plot. The relationship between the two films is well observed but he missed the point. A star transports a certain image/type/character and that is a golden opportunity for comedy (cast with or against type) allowing weird/queer turns otherwise impossible. Both films are able to use this effect expertly(and don't take themselves too seriously). And personally I don't think that Lee's interest in Hewitt is just hormone driven; she acts unordinary enough to quicken interests (her look merely accelerating it).Some analysisIt is quite interesting to compare mother (Weaver) and daughter (Hewitt). Their mode of attack is totally different (and complementary;strategist vs. tactician), based on background and experience (the bet scene in the bar is a typical example). Hewitt uses direct one-step approach with physical contact and unmistakable double entendres but has no backup plan. In case of failing she has to retreat and becomes bitchy. Weaver avoids bodily contact(sometimes nearly morbidly), her approach is multi-step, indirect. She has either a backup plan ready or can improvise very fast. Contrary to Hewitt she has perseverance and can use unconventional methods. And while Hewitt is soft under a (fragile) steel hull, Weaver is able and willing to use a sledge-hammer to crack the nut. This is where the bitter undertone breaks the comic surface, because we learn, that she must have been like her daughter once and wants to spare her the bitter experiences that turned herself into a cruel cynic. I think the films main problem is to reach the mandatory happy ending in time without making the back conversion unbelievable (the solution is at least unsatisfactory). Lot of critics said, the ending took to long. I say, the makers had the choice between tragicomedy or another half hour - they chose neither. Please propose a better solution.

Not only is she amazingly sexy and beautiful in equal measure but she can actually act! That is so unusual at this time to have both an attractive actress who can act as well. She uses her looks and her curves to great effect but she also turns a comedy role into a hugely touching romance. There is one scene late into the film, (you might want to miss this part out if you haven't already seen it) on her wedding night when she knows what her mother is doing and she sheds a single tear. She doesn't blubber her way through it, which would have been pitiful, but she lets one teardrop roll down her cheek.But if you don't watch it for that, then you have to watch it for the comedy, the plot, the timing and Jason Lee in role that Kevin Smith didn't write.

Perhaps you think of The Sting, or, as a friend of mine was expecting before he saw this movie, The Grifters. In any case, that friend in question told me to give Heartbreakers a miss as it was little more than a farce.Armed with such advanced warning, I went to see the film anyway. (That's the kind of guy I am.) So perhaps my low expectations had something to do with it, but actually I think I would have enjoyed this movie regardless of my friend's lounge bar review. How, from the marketing and the poster, he could have expected a Grifters is beyond me, but it would go some way to explaining his sense of disappointment. Me, I found no House of Games, and if I had I suspect I wouldn't have laughed as much as I did. Perhaps elements of this were a touch Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, but for my money, Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt outperform Steve Martin and Michael Caine in their venture into the world of con-artistry.The cons, like the movie itself, are light in tone, and when it attempts some degree of depth, with the mother-daughter relationship between Sigourney and Jennifer, it either skims the surface or goes a little soft. Plotwise, this will not stretch you, and you will not be taxed, unravelling the complexities of the various scams and tricks,and since the film dips into romantic comedy territory, the ultimate outcome is, of course, predictable. However, the route the movie takes in reaching that outcome is not.The key reason for that success lies in a too-often neglected aspect of the art of movie making namely, characterisation. The characters are all well-drawn and superbly realised by the performers; the two leads share a good on-screen chemistry, and they are complimented wonderfully by Ray Liotta and Gene Hackman, who all seem to understand the importance of character in this light and thoroughly unarmoured vehicle. Even the love interest, ordinarily an immigrant from the realm of the bland, takes the form of Jason Lee, and is given some terrific exchanges with JLH. Assisted by some truly sparkling dialogue, all of these characters are what drives this movie, which is (take note, film makers)the way it should be.Perhaps the plot is not especially crafty, but the characters, the dialogue and the performances are artful. The cons are light, yes. But the pros are well above average, and make this movie entirely worth a watch. One of the finer examples of its breed.

The film is original, crude and witty with heaps of cool plot twists and a great script that dishes up plenty of laughs and shocks. The performances are superb, with Jennifer Love Hewitt giving the best performance of the film as the sexy, smart daughter of a con woman who follows in her mother's footsteps but inside is really just a young girl looking for the right path in love. Hewitt gives a dazzling show and shows there is more to her ability than running from a hooked hand. Sigourney Weaver's neat turn as naughty mother gives her a much-needed villain character (sure, there's Alien, but we're starting to tire of that!) and Ray Liotta's good-turned-bad character is displayed well by his skills. Liotta is having a good year; Hannibal also really impressed me. Maybe Hewitt's continuous running-away-from-love can be irritating and the film runs too long, but otherwise this is a groovy and entertaining movie with neat ideas.

As a comedy, the script is very good throughout with some sparkling scenes and one-liners. The big let-down though is the characterisation which is largely absent. There are only three characters who have any real substance to them Sigourney Weaver's Max, Jennifer Love Hewitt's Page, and Gene Hackman's outrageous spluttering billionaire, William B Tensy. Unfortunately, Hackman only has about twenty minutes in the picture, and Jennifer Love Hewitt displays a woodenness which would make Pinocchio shed a tear of compassion. Despite performing all the physical actions the director has requested of her, and speaking her lines in that clear and perky manner of several young starlets, she manages to give bring no life to her character whatsoever. Sitting in the audience, you will wonder if she is playing her natural self, trying too hard to be funny, completely misinterpreting the role, or if that's just the best she can do in a comedic role. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure she will go on to become a popular bankable star and make millions... but if she is ever hoping to achieve any kind of recognition for her acting ability, I would seriously recommend that she take her trade elsewhere. At the opposite end of the spectrum is Sigourney Weaver, who delivers just the sort of fantastic comedic performance that critics might consider nominating for an award (although I suspect the film is just a bit too silly for this to happen). Not that this is any great surprise, since she has proved her aptitude for comedy time and again in Ghostbusters, Dave and Galaxy Quest. Here, she has a whale of a time waltzing around in numerous costumes, wigs and accents, playing the flirtatious and deceptive sides of her character to maximum effect. She is without a doubt the best thing in this movie and the glue that holds it together; although the script shares out the gags fairly evenly between its characters, most of them are just too boring (Jason Lee), stereotypical (Ray Liotta) or short-lived (Hackman) to have an impact. Which is a pity, since the concept stretches a long way and a huge hit could have been on the cards. Nevertheless, the film is entertaining enough and worth seeing (in my humble opinion) for Sigourney Weaver's triumphant performance, especially as a Russian! Meanwhile the cinematography is crisp, clear and colourful throughout, and the score by John Debney and Danny Elfman is energetic and very complementary to the movie. 7.5/10 "}{"Title":"A different, interesting comedy.","Date":"2 September 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance","Review":"  Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sigourney Weaver, Gene Hackman and Ray Liotta, are just some of the cast in this different but interesting comedy about a mother and daughter con team.

There are 2 points hitherto unaddressed which I think I should just fill in1 - (good) - There is a sort of acting versatility going on here from all the players.  While Weaver, Liotta, L-Hewitt all reprise familiar-ish roles, the director has definitely softened their edges.  For the first time ever I really believed there could be a softer side to Liotta, and JLH's ewing and whatevering seemed genuinely to be a facade of cool bravado not an expression of dimwittedness.2 - (bad) - I don't know if the movie presentation of cigarettes and smokers as worse than rape and murder is acceptable over there in the USA but here in Britain it's laughable (in a pitiful way, not a comic way!), and this movie is no exception. In the cinema everyone was looking at each other and shaking their heads at the treatment of smoking which seemed a little too strong to be truly tongue-in-cheek.

SPOILERS For those who go in spite of the mediocre reviews because they like the concept, prepare for a disappointment. It's just badly executed! Terrible writing and unfunny characters. It's either boring, embarrassing, or both at most times.Gene Hackman's character was the only one who breathed some life into this flat tire of a film, but alas it's not enough to get past Weaver's sad attempt at badly-written comedy, and her big-boobed but boring and annoying daughter is also quite pitiful.For fans of the seduction concept, just rent a copy of Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, which was a WAY WAY funnier and original film.Have I said enough? Forget renting it for that matter, it's barely worth even that except for die-hard fans of Hackman (whose character is unfortunately mercilessly and unfunnily killed off before he has a chance to turn the tables on his wannabe seductresses).

It was a broad comedy with a plot so thin that it gets tiresome after the first ten minutes of the movie.

"},{"Title":"A SMALL CON JOB","Date":"12 May 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance","Review":"  ***SPOILERS***Where did they spend the budget on this movie?  Visually it's a swampy mess the color is in unvaryingly muddy orange-golden tones, the camera seems to be misplaced in almost every shot, and the editing is a shambles, often catching the action at the wrong moments, making the performers look gawky and foolish.  Some crucial plot elements also seem to be missing (there is a corpse that is never accounted for) and promising ideas are barely carried through or not carried out at all.What's amazing about Heartbreakers is that the actors sustain their dignity among the ruins, trying their damnedest to make us ignore the debris.  That they fail to do it should not be held against them; their gallantry amidst chaos is truly admirable.Sigourney Weaver and Jeniffer Love Hewitt play Max and Page, a mother-and-daughter team of scam artists whose specialty is duping men out of their bank accounts.  Their modus operandi is simple Max seduces a wealthy mark into a swiftly arranged marriage, falls dead drunk asleep during their honeymoon night, the poor horny sucker is rigged to leap after Page's tarty little bottom (they work separately so they don't seem connected to each other), Max catches him with his pants down and, Voilá!, she demands and gets a quickie divorce along with a big, fat cash settlement.  They're professionally swift greenback devourers; women as a matriarchy of flippantly greedy manipulative gorgons the self-made American male's worst nightmare.At the beginning we watch how they operate as they swindle a swaggering-macho, Italian-American car chopper (Ray Liotta) and then hastily leave town.  Page wants to break out on her own, and Max agrees to divide their earnings.  But after an unaccounted brush with the IRS, and now left penniless and owing money, they decide for a last big one together in Palm Springs, land of the plenty and the very, very rich.Sigourney Weaver is a gracefully physical female actor with seemingly endless reserves of energy and good will, and she is not wrong for the part, but she is the one most affected by the technical ineptitudes (sometimes they cut to or away from her in the middle of a word) and by what seems to be the director's indifference.  Undaunted, she forges ahead, giving her role (and the movie) everything she has.  Like Weaver, the young Jennifer Love Hewitt (a lovely, still-unexperienced, but bravely resilient performer) desperately tries to give this movie some semblance of comic life.  And so does Nora Dunn as a treacherous chambermaid, while Anne Bancroft and Carrie Fisher evaporate in their bit roles.It's the leading men who come out much better.Ray Liotta is a terrific screwball performer.  Making the most of his screwily expressive pale blue eyes, mischievous little-boy smiles, and lightning-fast delivery, he has some of the best lines of the movie, even tossing out the flattest ones as if they were million-dollar zingers. He's a whirlwind of an actor that has never been given his due.As the young romantic lead, the talented Jason Lee brings the movie a welcome presence (we can see why Page is attracted to him).  His soft, dazed delivery is an oasis of calming sanity amidst all the laboriously overheated frenzy going on around him (and around us, too; he looks as bewildered as we are).But it's the apparently indestructible Gene Hackman, as William B. Tensy, the billionaire whom Max targets for her next scam, who walks away with the movie, or, rather, strolls out of it, without a single visible scratch. In a world seemingly of his own, with a wormy complexion and a perpetually burning cigarette protruding from between foul, yellow-grey lips and teeth, Hackman gleefully satirizes the detached smug casualness of the filthy rich; he coughs and retches and spits and growls his few lines of tar-and-nicotine-infested dialogue with nary a touch of affectation.  He's an amiably revolting wreck, always on the verge of asphyxiation, and the more we see of him the more we like him for his innocent indifference to his own disgustingness; once he departs we miss him being around.Something awful happened to this movie between its inception and delivery. We watch as the plot thickens and the complications pile up and bump into one another, but we do not feel them building up pleasantly.  Why, for instance, do the female characters come out as so unsympathetic in relation to the males?  In terms of character, the women are no worse than the men. Both are just as greedy and self-centered.  Why this discrepancy in feeling? Is this negativity directed against the female performers?  Whatever the reason is behind the spite, and whoever is responsible for it, I must say that it fails; Heartbreakers crashes down as a movie, but the actors, both male and female, rise well above it and make what might be intolerable agreeably passable.

In fact, I was begging for the predicatable ending, but did not get it. Ray Liotta does the best with the pitiful dialogue that he is given. He is a character actor now, and he acquits himself well. I do not know if his looks have really faded or if it is tricks, but since he plays Johnny Depp's Dad in Blow, I am going to assume the former. In any event, some of you guys will be happy to note that he plays a run of the mill b*****d in this picture. You might see elsewhere that Gene Hackman is the highlight of this film. Do not believe it. Liotta makes much out of nothing. He is to be commended.Weaver should be ashamed of herself. Evidently, paychecks are hard to come by these days. Hewitt does what she does best, look hot. If that is why you want to come to the theatre, I cannot discourage you. It is painful at times to look at her, she looks so good. The plot is so predicatable, the movie cannot possibly be enjoyable. Jason Lee, as always, is a hilarious as the handsome smartass. But even he cannot save the film.

Well let me say that my girlfriend and I both walked out of 'Heartbreakers' with hate on our minds. I was surprised cause I thought she'd like it but even she was bored through it. Let me explain.The movie is about a mother and daughter con team that trick wealthy guys into marrying them and then trying to catch them cheating so they can divorce them and blah blah, get their money, buy dresses etc...Ok, now after that complex plot has been laid out I'm pretty sure that you can predict the rest of the movie.

J-Love magically appears in a Honda S2000 (guess she had an extra 32K burning a hole in her pocket). J-Love meets a bar owner (Jason Lee), Weaver meets Gene Hackman. Things happen.

If that wasn't enough, the movie is around 2 hours. 2 painful hours!!! Movies like this should not be more than 90 minutes tops but I guess they feel the longer the movie, the better it will be.This movie was trying to come off as sophisticated with all these stupid plot twists but these plot twists only traveled in a straight line. Very predictable, very boring and very amateurish despite its huge cast of stars. Is there anyone that could act in this movie besides Hackman who I thought added the only aspect of comedy to this film? Much like the movie Mars Attacks this movie fails. It doesn't matter if you get a lot of big name actors or actresses in a movie if it bad, its bad and this is beyond that. I don't really know what else to say except to avoid this movie.

It's just not a very good one.Years ago, in the distant 1930s, Hollywood used to crank out sophisticated comedies like this, directed by guys like Preston Sturgess, Ernst Lubitsch and Frank Capra, etc. Good examples were Sturgess' The Lady Eve and Wild Bill Wellman's Nothing Sacred.  But that was a different time, and con games seemed a lot more acceptable, especially if they involved clipping the rich or even putting one over on the public in general. After all, everyone was broke in the '30s and nobody felt too bad about running a con. The last time somebody tried to capture that feeling was in the 70s, when George Roy Hill re-paired Redford and Newman in The Sting.  Heartbreakers goes for that kind of duel lead, buddy movie feel, using two women who are supposed to be mother and daughter.Signourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt both do their best with what they're given and both acquit themselves very well.  Gene Hackman and Ray Liotta chew up scenery, as they're supposed to, as a couple of their marks.But not a word of the story rings even slightly true and not once the whole time do you suspect things will not work out in the end for the two conwomen.And whatever actual issues the film deals with, including the need for the daughter to break away from her mother, are so heavily handled and so tacked on at the end, that any kind of suspense that might have cropped up even by accident dissolves in smoke.This is a picture that you can rent some night when all else fails, unless you're a man and want to see Love Hewitt bending over a lot in low cut dresses on the big screen. Then, by all means, see it in a theater near you.

I have often thought that really talented actors/actresses can make an average film somewhat good, and that is definitely the case here.  Sigourney Weaver and Gene Hackman are over-the-top charactictures of people that we have all met at some point, and that's just fine.  Their jokes are silly, but they're good for a laugh and that's what we're expecting.  It was refreshing to see Ray Liotta actually contribute to a movie (as he also did in Blow, but little else) and I liked watching his take on the suckered New Jersey man with a short temper but a big heart.   In short, this movie doesn't promise what it doesn't deliver.  It doesn't boast itself as anything but a silly little funny movie and that's exactly what it is.  If you've enjoyed the con aspect of such films as Dirty Rotten Scoundrals then this is fun to watch.

"},{"Title":"***","Date":"30 March 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance","Review":"  The con is definitely on in director David Mirkin's (Romy and Michele's High School Reunion) new flick Heartbreakers, a romantic comedy that offers just about everything to every gender and age. The good part about this film is that it is hilarious, but the best is that it does it the old fashioned way, with barely any toilet humor at all.Heartbreakers earns it's humor by letting the character's make fun of themselves, especially Ray Liotta who comes off extremely well as a rough talking and goofy goodfella from Jersey. You can tell that the cast is having a lot of fun in this movie because they basically carry it. The script is very jumpy, cutting from good-natured romances, to funny and mean spirited cons, to a touching mother-daughter relationship. It is hard to exactly see where the point of this story is going sometimes because it is dealing with so much, but still the dialogue is very good and David Mirkin gets his cast to all put in lively and wild performances that make it all seem worth while.Our two cons are Max (Sigourney Weaver) and Page (Jennifer Love Hewitt), a mother- daughter team who center their sights on two timing males. Ever since Max was abandoned by Page's father, she has been swindling the male sex, both getting her revenge and getting enough money to get by.The way it works is that Max spends her time romancing a certain man, for instance the movie's opening victim (Ray Liotta), until he is ready to pop the question. Once the marriage has ended, she holds out on the sex, driving the guy crazy. Then the next day he sees Page, who in this plot just happens to be his new secretary in a short skirt. It doesn't take long before Page has him right around her little finger, and it isn't long before Max comes in and catches them. Then words like divorce and cash settlement are used. This funny opening couple of scenes is only the beginning.These women have a whole bunch of tricks, using their bodies and their brains to get exactly what they want for the least amount of money. They can get out of anything, and away from everybody, except the IRS. An agent (Anne Bancroft) finally comes forward, saying that the two have never paid their bills, and if they don't, their assets will be frozen, which means the 300 thousand dollars they just stole will be gone.Max has more problems as well. Page is ready to leave the nest and meet a man of her own, but Max is afraid to let her go because she doesn't want what happened to her to happen to Page. She is able to convince Page into doing one more job with her. The target, a rich old man (Gene Hackman) living in the upper part of Florida.While on the island, Max manages to get close to the chain smoking millionaire, using her best Russian accent. Page, meanwhile, starts working on a bar owner named Jack (Jason Lee), who if he sells could earn up to 3 million dollars. This being her first job by herself, she wants it to be perfect, but doesn't expect to actually fall in love with him.If you had to pick a strong and independent actress for your lead heroine, I don't think anyone could rise above the talents of Sigourney Weaver. She is a wonderfully funny combination of devious, sexy, smart, caring, and resourceful. She keeps an in control attitude on through the entire course of this film, and I actually cared about her, and her evil manipulation, because she gives her character good reason for everything she does. Here is a great female hero against male jerks and pigs everywhere.Hewitt isn't far behind with a free spirited, pouty, and sexy performance as her anxious to start a life of her own daughter. Hewitt and Weaver are very funny together, especially in a battle of the bodies scene with former SNL cast member Kevin Nealon. Mirkin never lets the relationship between the two get overly sentimental, but yet still makes the mother-daughter conflict interesting. The same can also be said for the slight romance between Hewitt and Jason Lee. In a year full of romantic disappointments, these two make up the first likable couple of the year, even if their time together is fairly short.And Gene Hackman is absolutely side splitting in this movie, showing a wheezing, sickly looking, rich target who is just infatuated with cigarettes. Watching him defend the tobacco company right before his parrot dies from second hand smoke is exactly the kind of in denial style humor he brings to this film. This is Hackman at his funniest, and it is a joy to see him in a role where he can just cut loose and have fun with a character for a change.Heartbreakers is a decent comedy that never comes off as either feministic or sexist. It is all handled with great care by David Mirkin and he and the cast come through with the first really funny film of the year. If your looking for a good date movie, or just a good buddy flick, this one's heart is in the right place.

None of that here. The plot is thin and senseless and the few chuckles come from isolated  moments -- Ray Liotta shooting at fish and...well, one moment, anyway. The biggest weakness is the relationship between Jason Lee and Love Hewitt -- since she treats him so badly throughout the film, it's hard to understand why he pursues her, except, of course, for her two most obvious assets. For more info, I recommend taking a look at Entertainment Weekly's review; it's on the money.

Love-Hewitt is luscious as usual, and does an excellent job at portraying the emotionally twisted daughter of Sigourney Weaver.

I liked it, but let me qualify that for the cynical internet geeks out there Jennifer Love does not take off her clothes (but rather struts her stuff around in skimpy clothing, which was fine by me), the ending is a typical Hollywood fare, and it doesn't delve quite as much as The Grifters into the underbelly of con artistry.

Jennifer Love Hewitt, who plays Sigourney Weaver's daughter, proves that she has moved beyond the Kingdom ruled by Freddie Prinze Jr., and into one where she can hold her own with more weathered actors like Weaver and Gene Hackman.Gene successfully puts the Hack in Hackman in this movie as a billionaire tobacco tycoon who has an equal affection for Weaver as he does for clearing his lungs.  Jason Lee, who has been for limited to modest success in mostly Kevin Smith movies for the past decade or so, is refreshingly earnest without being achingly saccharine.Laughs are plentiful and well timed, and it should be mentioned that for the first time in a while Ray Liotta manages to make his annoying nature work for him rather than against him.

Much of the disappointment I feel for this film is because of how good it could have been.First off, the script - it was simply over the top. Often, more subtle humor works better - the audience does not need to be hit with a sledgehammer when a tack hammer will do the job. The plot, complete with twists (some predictable, some not) was workable - and there were some truly funny moments, but they ended up being overshadowed by the overdone bits.Much of the cast did good work - Ray Liotta turned out for a surprisingly good performance, and Jennifer Love Hewett surprised me with the quality of her performance. Ms. Weaver, however, seemed at many points to be simply reading the cue cards. In light of her usually excellent work, I can only surmise that she was as appalled by the material she was being asked to work with as I was, and couldn't get into the part and retain her self-esteem.There are some great lines, and the general plot is believable, but this is NOT a 'con' flick - the con artistry that movie viewers have loved in 'The Sting' and 'Ocean's Eleven' is pretty well blown by the general ineptness of the con artists.One remarkably onerous note may please some viewers. The mark (capably played with awful lines by Gene Hackman) is such a caricature of the offensive, rude smoker that it's likely to be offensive to anyone who knows, likes, or is a smoker themselves. The anti-smoking message was so loud that it ruined some scenes that could have been humorous otherwise.All in all, a worthwhile flick if you like the overdone comedy of 'Dumb and Dumber' better than you like, say, the obvious but not overplayed 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' or 'Bedazzled'.

WAW! Look at the way it handles the matters, for instance scene like the one of setting up the maid; it's composite with real sense of humor. The script reminded me of the old Hollywood classics, especially (Some Like it Hot), in terms of 2 characters having false identities, conning 2 other characters in love with them, all happen on some beach, with damn good comic situations and surprises. In fact comedy doesn't stop in here. There is a palpable caring behind every line and shot. Imagine a movie reveals that even (Ray Liotta) has a talent for comedy; never forget him saying impatiently I teach college stuff !.(Jason Lee) proves again that he can do romantic comedies yet Hollywood is the last to know, since no one seems to hire him much. However (Sigourney Weaver) was the one who stole the show with loose performance and magical femininity; despite her age, and being not that sexy, I noticed that she bewitched some young male viewers (some of them are friends of mine!). I loved the most the scene of singing (Back In The U.S.S.R); that was a classic, as well as the whole movie I think.Now the faults, not many though. For one; not utilizing (Gene Hackman) well; he played an aged buffoon or a lighted cigarette which about to end, yet didn't add much except some likability, since the written material was way lower than his abilities, and could be played by anybody else. The third act steered to a less strong, less comic curve, with something like another story. On some level it doesn't have a fair climax, the done one is good but unsatisfying a bit or not as crazy as what's before it. How they forgot to reuse that maid ?! She could have returned, with some of the prison's buddies, to revenge and make the climax hotter !Some sexual jokes were ugly. And speaking of ugliness leads us to the movie's biggest problem; of course you know whom I'm talking about. Name one chick who when you see her in bikini you cry&#x85;out of pain ! (Jennifer Love Hewitt) who &#x96; thank god &#x96; has no relation with movies nowadays is so creepily skinny, with a face of a gazing crow. So how about putting her in a very tight, very short dresses all the time (to watch her bones ?!!) while acting that she's a vamp who melts down men (she melts down my tolerance for sure!). Now I partly understood from where (Sigourney Weaver)'s massive magic, as a beauty queen this time, came; it's the irony of having (Love Hewitt) as a co-star! And it doesn't take a genius to discern who was the least comic, or the none-comic, in this cast also.(Heartbreakers) is a vigorous and intelligent comedy. In the same day I watched it, I watched also (There is Something about Marry). No need to say which one won my attention and admiration, forcing me to respect it and re-watch it.P.S  at one moment there was such a blasphemous line (Hackman's remake about who's seeing him and his woman while they're alone). It was dreadful, free, and unfunny. The thing is that has become frequent in movies lately to the extent of being a Hollywood habit, a strange and nasty habit !

Although it scores high points in entertainment, the movie will leave with nothing to look back on. That's where the movie falls on it's backside.I give praise to the cast for turning in wonderful performances and it shows that even big-name actors and actresses can star in clunkers and continue to provide enjoyment during its two-hour duration. The characters here are not much to be remembered by, but the acting from the cast make seem forgiving. Gene Hackman for example shows he's having a good time here and has the cantankerous William Tensy down to a science. Even though he is an ugly character in more ways than one with the flam-induced cough, liver spots and an unscrupulous demeanour. The dirty deeds are delinquent, the jokes are crafty, and the public embarrassments are fun to watch. But at times, the humour feels very forced and everything looks so by-the-script which makes the performers here are trying to know their lines instead of living the part of their characters. The characters don't register any kind of feelings except for being lustful and self-centred. When pity was at stake, the reaction was nonexistent, because there was nothing to take sorrow from. The character of Jack (Jason Lee) lost all my care for him because I couldn't understand why he was so smitten over Page Connors (Hewitt) where her actions are deceitful and conniving. Having a movie featuring emotionally challenged characters is not my main concern. But when it's juxtaposed with limited and banal material, that's what makes Heartbreakers so mediocre at best. I'm sure it's motive is to enjoy the movie, but when it offers little to enjoy, it's very hard to be satisfied. It get really drained out near the end. The plot wanders away and humour becomes absent. Tensy's corpse scenes offer no laughing value at all. I wished Dean (Ray Liotta) had the balls to kills off the two antagonists (Hewitt an Sigourney Weaver). I was upset that the maid didn't take down Max. Instead it was in reverse. Many movies have complicated things going for that may require multiple viewings. Heartbreakers was just what the title was, a very sad heart-breaker. It was fun, but very low in production to keep me satisfied.

Although they have a few minor money-making schemes such as adding broken glass to food in order to claim compensation from restaurant owners, their real speciality is a trick they play on wealthy men. Maxine will persuade the man to marry her, using a false name and without telling him that she has a daughter. Page then seduces the man, ensuring that they are caught in flagrante delicto by Maxine, who immediately files for divorce and walks away with a lucrative settlement. They first pull this stunt on Dean, a dodgy car dealer, but Maxine has her eyes on an even bigger prize, William B Tensy, an elderly tobacco billionaire. A complicating factor arises when Page falls in love with Jack, a handsome young barman and the intended object of one of her cons, much to the disgust of her mother who believes that the male sex exists solely for the purpose of being cheated.This film is sometimes described as a romantic comedy, but to me it seemed like a comedy incorporating a romance, which is not quite the same thing. In a romantic comedy it is the love-story which drives the entire plot; here, the romance between Page and Jack is only one of a number of plot elements, and not really the most interesting. There are a number of very funny scenes, most of them involving either Sigourney Weaver's Maxine or Gene Hackman's Tensy, the ultimate disgusting old man, wheezing his way into his grave through reckless over-indulgence in his own products. (Tensy stubbornly refuses to believe that smoking is bad for the health). Weaver is particularly good in scenes where her character has to think quickly, such as the one where Maxine deals with Tensy's domineering housekeeper or where, when pretending to be Russian, she is challenged to prove it by singing a Russian song. (There is no real reason why Maxine should have pretended to be a foreigner; it was simply a plot device to set up this scene).There are, however, two problems with the film. First, at over two hours, it is overlong. There are a few exceptions, but the natural upper limit for light-hearted comedies seems to be around the 90/100 minute mark. Humour is best put over in a shorter, more compact form than serious drama.The other problem with the film is that the characters are too unsympathetic. In the best-known, and in my view the greatest, of all con-man films, The Sting, although the two main characters are undoubtedly a pair of rogues, Robert Redford and Paul Newman succeed in making them likable, even lovable. They are, of course, helped by the fact that their victim is himself a ruthless criminal and that they set him up in order to extract a kind of justice for a friend whom he has murdered. (Police corruption means that it is unlikely that the killer will ever have to stand trial).Page and Maxine look very glamorous and seductive- their normal uniforms are low-cut blouses and high-cut miniskirts- but come across as rather heartless. In contrast to the heroes of The Sting, they have no motive for their schemes other than financial gain, The script suggests that Page herself might be a victim of her mother's greed and that she might have been sucked into this lifestyle against her will, but one gets little sense of this from Jennifer Love Hewitt's rather cold, self-assured character. I would agree with the critic of the San Francisco Chronicle who suggested that the role might have gone to an actress such as Reese Witherspoon or Kirsten Dunst who could have made Page seem more vulnerable and sympathetic. This is an occasionally amusing comedy, but not one that I found easy to like. 6/10 "},{"Title":"Heartbreakers","Date":"19 April 2006","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance","Review":" This is an okay film I suppose, but the thought of a woman and her daughter conning men to love them and then it ends in despair where they get money, it's just a bit terrible.

Take Jack, played by Jason Lee, for example. Can he be any more stupid? I don't understand why he would fall in love with a girl who treats him so horribly; Jane's schizoid feelings and obvious lying would make any man of reasonable intelligence kick her to the curb.

Love. It's nice to see her continuing to pursue an acting career by way of the Wonderbra. I'm amused that she believes she's got a real future in the movie business, as much as I snickered when her latest CD dropped (off the charts). She should do the Playboy layout while her girls can still hold themselves up.Enough about Ms. Love - let's talk about Paige, her character in HEARTBREAKERS. How, I wonder, does a mother purposefully raise a child to be an amoral criminal? Did she ever question her mother's way of life? Rebel as a teenager? Turn her mother in for spite? A movie as long as this should have provided some backstory, so we could understand where these people have come from.Both she and Weaver employ in HEARTBREAKERS screenplay device I abhor talking to themselves (i.e. the audience). The makers of this movie have such a low opinion of their audience's intelligence that they give dialogue to their actresses that can be left unsaid. Hello! HEARTBREAKERS is easy enough to follow - we don't need people muttering what's obvious to anyone with half a brain.I suppose, if there's anyone in this movie to like, it's the tobacco tycoon played by Gene Hackman. But the movie doesn't help us here, either; this character is just as clueless as Lee's. Surely a successful millionaire would be able to spot such a ruse like Weaver's noticeably spurious Russian act. Gimme a break.But that's not all. What happened to him after he died? Was his death ruled a natural one? Did the cops wise up to these scam artists? Who discovered the body, and when? Who inherited his fortune? His former maid? Why did th e movie completely forget to resolve this plotline? Why is the movie so absentminded it can't remember its own plot?Hackman is, by process of elimination, the only character we can possibly like in HEARTBREAKERS, even though he's in only about half the movie. Since the other males are either moronic (Lee) or crooked (Ray Liotta, whose character runs a chop shop), it's a grave error to dispose of Hackman so carelessly.HEARTBREAKERS contains unlikable characters who inhabit the most contrived plot that's filled with improbable points (like the car accident and the manner of Hackman's final return to his home), all of which is wrapped up in, of course, a happy ending in which all sins are forgiving. These people deserve each other.3/10  "}{"Title":"Jennifer Love Hewitt's evident transition...","Date":"8 May 2003","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance","Review":"  I found Heartbreakers to be a jovial and entertaining piece of comedy which provided many laughs- and not in a dry, dull sense, however, in a witty and humorous manner.

He coughs, he chokes, he is plumed in smoke, but he keeps lighting them up, even as he's trying to bed Sigourney Weaver. Weaver is the senior partner in a mother and daughter team of con-artists, the younger half being Jennifer Love Hewitt. (It's pointless giving them their characters' names - they keep changing them!) Their speciality is for mom to wed a rich guy, only for daughter, in a skintight mini-dress, to lead him into temptation immediately after the ceremony; they then pocket the divorce settlement. One of the best features of the movie is the banter between Weaver and Hewitt. Like any mother and daughter, they don't agree on much, except for their jaundiced view of men. The film opens with Weaver's marriage to Ray Liotta, in his element as a sleazy Jersey used-car salesman, who doesn't take too long to get Hewitt's hair caught in his zipper. Then it's off to Palm Beach for the next mark, Hackman, where the main problems are to keep him spluttering as far as the altar, and for Weaver to maintain the Russian accent she's decided to adopt. All the principals are spot-on; the Palm Beach locations are easy on the eye; and there's a nice cameo by Anne Bancroft. The film maintains its cynical tone throughout, except for the love interest between Hewitt and Jason Lee, playing a boringly sincere bar owner, but even that has its funny moments.

But in the past, they didn't run the show, with the world-class actors lining up underneath them like the help. This clunky, stagy, very old-school comedy about a mother-and-daughter pair of grifters would still have been pretty excruciating, but probably less so, if there were a Reese Witherspoon or a Kate Hudson in the lead. With the Love, it's pure torture--and, on occasion, as when Love and Hackman are in the same frame, reality-defying and brain-boggling.What will happen when some of the tots being fed a steady pablum diet of Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar start spitting it back?

Heartbreakers is a great movie mainly because the way that it combined seduction and humor. Heartbreakers has some of the funniest lines and words that I have heard in a long time just listen at the mouths of Hewitt and Weaver. Most of all you enjoy not the words from Weaver and Hewitt but the view they provide. Now Jennifer Love Hewitt once again proves her young sexy self but you see how cunning her character is here she learned well from mother(Sigourney Weaver) and Hewitt is stunning as ever check out the short skirts and colored bras she wears. Now on to the pro and experienced con veteran and scam queen yes that is the Sigourney Weaver character and a comment on Sigourney I must say she is getting more beautiful with age wonder what her secrets are? She's looked good in the past but she attracted me most in this film I guess I'm like Ray and Gene that beauty and body attracted me so much that I would fall victim to her con. Boy us guys never learn it just goes to show how we think with our libido many times and not our mind. I suggest that you watch Heartbreakers it also has a story to it besides the con and seduction you will enjoy the beginning when Weaver and Hewitt scam Liotta and his New Jersey business that made the 13Th husband the two tricked now talk about women being in the money! Then it is down to Palm Beach, Florida requested by Hewitt where she finds unexpected love in the process while she helps mother(Weaver) do her best to con wealthy tobacco tycoon(Gene Hackman). Only to have plans go for a change. You will see Liotta go down to Palm Beach to break up the plans but never fear the pro the attractive Sigourney Weaver has a good plan B you will see in the end how she profits just pay close attention in this movie and Hewitt is happy to be to that point that is nothing is better that this sweet but cunning daughter Love Hewitt getting to leave the con nest and get that life of her own she wanted. Heartbreakers is a great film it has many things humor, con, and an intelligent story that was made great by two sexy and talented women Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt they were both ravishing and stunning.

Weaver plays a woman who uses her body to lure male suckers into marriage and is teaching her daughter to do the same.Nothing wrong with being a whore, I guess, if you are supplying a useful product at a reasonable price. But in this case the two women are felons, deceiving men in order to get all of their money, and doing it over and over, marriage after marriage.Okay, lots of funny movies have been made about rascals, both male and female, who marry foolish or stupid people in order to get their money. But these woman are much worse than mere rascals. They are congenital liars, lying even to each other and to people (such as love interest Jack) whom they love. They're such liars and cheats that they cannot even order lunch in a restaurant without making it a con job.They are also sluts. Hewitt spends virtually the entire movie in micro short dresses that make her body look like a statue of a fertility goddess, all in order to tease. Weaver similarly flaunts her body to tease and cajole men, over and over.We are supposed to overlook this behavior because--for example--Hewitt's character really loves Jack, though she has an astounding way of showing it. As for Jack, he is monumentally stupid not to see her for what she is.Nevertheless, the last 20 minutes of the movie goes to great lengths to make us believe that these two women are, after all, lovable. There is that tender moment (with the inevitable tinkling musical accompaniment), when Hewitt pledges her love to Jack. And then--oh, wonderful!--that moment when mother and daughter embrace.

But, but, and, well, -but-.Given it's high concept, Heartbreakers could have been Matchstick Men or The Grifters in the hands of someone like Ridley Scott or Steven Frears. Handed to a solid, if pedestrian, TV director like Dave Mirkin, however, it's little more than predictable pap.That's too bad, because the Dunn-Guay-Mazur script had a few interesting ideas about mothers and daughters, as well as con men being conned. I've met Weaver's character in real life at least a dozen times she has a determined but corrupted and paranoid vision of the world, and she teaches it to her kid. I'd give plenty to see more made of -that-.I've met Liotta's antisocial sex addict a few times, as well. Smug sociopathic fool for dangerous curves. (I've known them -considerably- further up the wise guy ladder than this, but the dynamics -- and the results -- were pretty much the same.) Manipulative beauty is one of the best plot foundations imaginable. Our society does not educate men to stand up to the force of face, figure and hormonal stimulation but simply acknowledges they're hopelessly outgunned by the relentless forces of natural selection. The femme fatale can do things to us we simply cannot do to them. Few think long enough to realize, Hey! No one's holding a gun to my head. Vivien Leigh's Scarlet O'Hara, Lana Turner's Cora Smith, Hedy Lamar's Delilah, Bella Darvi's Nefer in The Egyptian, and Sharron Stone's Catherine Trammel come to mind right away. I don't see that here in Sigorney Weaver -at- all, though Hewitt (at this age well on her way to being one the most formidable brunettes of all time before her unfortunate, and hopefully temporary, detour) has the physical -and- behavioral horsepower to pull it off.Can you see Angelica Huston and Annette Benning here? (Well; that's why The Grifters has a seven rating, even though I think a seven is a good half-point below what it deserves.) Frears' film is really dark, of course. And Matchstick is freaky deaky, but the queasy-making uncertain-father / sex-bomb-daughter relationship between the characters played by Cage and Lohman is why you guys laid a 7.4 on it.Save your breath I know this is supposed to be a light comedy. But it's -so- light it needs weights tied to its ankles. It's not funny. It's not dramatic. It's not intriguing. It's not interesting.Given the premise, and with people like Liotta, Hackman and Hewitt involved, better things could, and -should-, have happened here.

Much of the disappointment I feel for this film is because of how good it could have been.First off, the script - it was simply over the top. Often, more subtle humor works better - the audience does not need to be hit with a sledgehammer when a tack hammer will do the job. The plot, complete with twists (some predictable, some not) was workable - and there were some truly funny moments, but they ended up being overshadowed by the overdone bits.Much of the cast did good work - Ray Liotta turned out for a surprisingly good performance, and Jennifer Love Hewett surprised me with the quality of her performance. Ms. Weaver, however, seemed at many points to be simply reading the cue cards. In light of her usually excellent work, I can only surmise that she was as appalled by the material she was being asked to work with as I was, and couldn't get into the part and retain her self-esteem.There are some great lines, and the general plot is believable, but this is NOT a 'con' flick - the con artistry that movie viewers have loved in 'The Sting' and 'Ocean's Eleven' is pretty well blown by the general ineptness of the con artists.One remarkably onerous note may please some viewers. The mark (capably played with awful lines by Gene Hackman) is such a caricature of the offensive, rude smoker that it's likely to be offensive to anyone who knows, likes, or is a smoker themselves. The anti-smoking message was so loud that it ruined some scenes that could have been humorous otherwise.All in all, a worthwhile flick if you like the overdone comedy of 'Dumb and Dumber' better than you like, say, the obvious but not overplayed 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' or 'Bedazzled'.

The plot is weak in many areas &#150; the love story is unconvincing, the drifting in and out of major characters as required is lazy and the actual main thrust of the film contains too much that is neither clever nor funny and instead is just silly. It plods where it should fizz and it lacks a real sense of fun. This is not to suggest that it is terrible because it isn't &#150; it is actually watchable because it has just enough going for it to hold the attention but even the series of twists at the end are only competent.What helps the appeal of this film is the cast, but sadly they don't help the deliver that much. Weaver does well in the lead, managing to give a light touch while also convincing as an aging con artist. Hewitt looks great but her performance is undermined by her constantly screaming 'here are my breasts' by way of her costume &#150; I know her character is meant to be like but she brings nothing else to the role for the vast majority of the film, leaving her final quarter changes to be uninvolving and flat. Hackman tries to bring humour to his role but he can't manage it and, as much as I wanted to like his performance, I just didn't. Lee, so hilarious in Mallrats, is flat and bland here. He has the worst part of the film to deliver it and he seems to know himself that his is a bad lot with nothing he can do about it. Liotta gave me a few laughs towards the end but basically is just a plot device that is used, forgotten and then used again.Bancroft and Jones are nothing more than cameos and add very little to the film. It doesn't help that several of them have no characters to speak of; plus those that do, have characters that are quite hard to like and are only given very flat redemptions &#150; leaving me cold to them and their story.Overall this is watchable once but it is nothing more than that. It is not very funny and it is not very clever due to the material. The story plods at times, the plot doesn't convince or engage while the characters are either unconvincing and unlikeable, meaning even the stars involved cannot do anything to make it better than the uninspiring product that it turns out to be.

And (unlike Rat Race) they don't toss away having good characterization, an interesting plot with a few neat twists, and a story arc. It's quite intelligent and keeps you guessing, but not at all arty (which is a plus in my opinion).The acting is pretty good, and I noticed Jennifer Love Hewitt as a serious actress for the first time. Ray Liotta was perfect, with just the right touch of wacky so that the violence (there isn't much) becomes cartoony and fun rather than painful to watch. Sigourney Weaver was good as well, although she apparently chose to play her role straight rather than a little wacky, which would have fit the movie's theme better I feel.I can recommend this film without reservation.Who should see this film-- Comedy lovers, a must-see, especially for the modern womanwho liked Charlie's Angels.

The shocked wife immediately proceeds to a divorce, and the two ladies then share the alimony. Things go smoothly, until the two team-mates start to take divergent paths...Comparing the Heartbrakers with Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is uneven of course, as the former is a hilarious classic with performances, such as Martin's Ruprecht which cannot be matched. Still, Heartbreakers is quite entertaining, and despite its weak moments (such as the fact that a film of this type should not be peppered with so much romance), it easily clears the pass grade.Sigourney Weaver is good in her role; on the other hand, Paricia Love Hewitt's acting is satisfactory, but in my opinion she could do better than that.

Much of the romance is supposed to be comedic, and is mildly funny at best.  But the rare serious moments have no believability.  The lack of normal romance in Hollywood must prevent its filmmakers and writers from crafting a decent love story.  When will they figure out that no one actually falls in love in a day and a half?

Sending up his gangster persona, Liotta provides the movie's best humor with lines like (when asked if he can dispose of a dead body) I'm from Jersey, aren't I?  He and Gene Hackman are the only actors who seem to realize the inanity of the movie and provide fittingly ridiculous work.  Everyone else plays a one-note role all too seriously.

THE FIRST REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!! WARNING WARNING!!! IF YOU WANT TO AVOID SPOILERS, SKIP AHEAD TO THE SECOND REVIEW!!!***Here is the FIRST review. This one is written for ALL women, and enlightened men who DON'T automatically see women as sex objects. Heartbreakers begins with a promising enough story... Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt play a mother-daughter con team. Weaver romances and marries rich men, then Hewitt seduces them, just in time for Weaver to mistakenly walk in on them. She files for divorce, and she splits the settlement with her daughter. After some strange circumstances find them low on funds, Hewitt agrees to help her mother one last time. The target? A repulsive, phlegm hacking Gene Hackman (His name ironic and appropriate considering the nature of this role) as a cigarette company big wig. Along the way, Hewitt tries to branch out on her own, and ends up crossing paths with Jason Lee, as the owner of a seaside bar. After some initial conflicts (all from Hewitt), the two slowly find themselves falling in love with each other. Meanwhile, Ray Liotta is attempting to track Weaver down to convince her to take him back, (he was the jilted husband at the beginning of the film) and of course, he ends up finding out about the whole scam. As the con team, Weaver and Hewitt play off each other very well. The jibes and barbs seem genuine, and they are interesting, if untrustworthy characters. However, Weaver's Russian accent got on my nerves, as I kept expecting her to say WE HAVE TO KILL MOOSE AND SQUIRREL, BORIS! Hewitt shows promise in breaking her cliched scream queen persona, and Hackman gives the most convincing argument for quitting smoking I've ever seen. Liotta's role is largely forgotten until the last third of the film, when his true slimyness emerges unchecked. Lee's character, although likeable, is a flake. A nice guy, but not bright enough to give Hewitt the boot after her first few rude comments. I guess he doesn't believe in bad first impressions.Overall, My wife and I sat confused in the theatre as the end credits rolled. Too many twists, too many cons. By the final half hour, NOBODY in their right mind in that cast should have been talking to one another, LET ALONE trusting each other! When Liotta decided to trust the ladies to get his money back, RIGHT AFTER HE THREATENED TO KILL THEM BOTH, that just sunk our opinion of the script writers right there. We also noticed something funky with the lighting. On occasion, in scenes where Hewitt was the focal point of the camera, the image appeared slightly dark and grainy, but when it would switch back to Weaver or whomever she was talking with, the image appeared fine. This happened in at least two different scenes, in two different locals. Very strange cinematrography there. Also, the scene in the trailer and commercial that shows Weaver and Hewitt in a sports car driving across a bridge tossing money out left and right, DID NOT appear in the film at all. Crazy. I would recommend waiting until this comes out on video. Then, you can rewatch the truly funny scenes (and there are several, just not a non-stop amount) over and over, you'll pay less than at the theatre, and you can pause it if you need to get up. Trust me, it's a better bargain that way.*** end of FIRST review ****** beginning of SECOND review***Now, the second review is for all those men who are just going to see Heartbreakers to see Hewitt wear tight cleavage bearing outfits.ME LIKE JENNIFER!!!!! JENNIFER HOT!!!! SHE REAL PRETTY!!!! ME LIKE ME LIKE!!!! She wear tight clothes!!!! Bends down a bunch!!!! Pretends to do ORAL SEX!!!! ME LIKE ME LIKE!!!!! SHE REALLY HOT!!!! SHE have NICE RACK!!!! ME want to LOVE HER HEWITTS!!!!! ME.... HEYYYYYYYY WHO SWIPED MY BEER????*** end of SECOND review ***So there you have it. A good attempt with fine performances, but a confusing trail of cons and twists, and a ridiculously improbable ending. But if Jennifer Love is your girl, you'll be VERY satisfied. ^) "}{"Title":"Only for fans of Jennifer Love Hewitt's Breast!","Date":"10 January 2003","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance","Review":"  This is a HORRIBLE comedy!

Frustrated and wanting to go out on her own, the daughter (Hewitt) agrees to one last job setting up an ill but rich tobacco millionaire in Florida. Complications ensue when one of their former marks (an amusing Liotta) returns to settle the score, and their current mark (Hackman) turns out to be much more than they bargained for. Occasionally funny but uneven comedy has a likable and enthusiastic cast, but it loses energy and becomes predictable as it nears the finale. Not a bad way to pass the time though. **½ "},{"Title":"Some movies just shouldn't be made","Date":"4 August 2001","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance","Review":"  The studio wants to say this is a story of a mom and daughter who swindle rich men out of their money by marrying them and then setting them up to cheat.

Supposedly this film is a comedy but with such contrived situations and jokes it's as funny as a hole in the head. Heartbreakers desperately wants to be some quirky, hybrid American Pie slash Something About Mary flick but it tries way too hard, or it doesn't try hard enough, maybe that's the problem. My fellow viewer and I just rolled our eyes and commented more than once on how utterly moronic it all was.Perhaps this comes down to the actors too, who seem unconvincing and demonstrate next to no chemistry whatsoever. Especially between Hewitt and Weaver, and when there is no chemistry between the leads who are supposed to be mother and daughter, a film like this is destined to failure. 2 our of 10. Not truly awful but very close to it. Don't waste your time.

I don't think that there was one joke in this pathetic movie that was new.  Even the jokes that were remotely funny, ceased to be funny because they were so predictable. Another strike against it?  All of the characters were unlikable.  Sure, Jason Lee was ok, but how could he like Jennifer Love Hewitt when she was such a bimbo bitch.  Sigourney Weaver is now trying to play sexy roles with this movie and Galaxy Quest.  WHY?  She wasn't good looking in Alien and Gorrillas in the Mist, and she isn't good looking now.  But at least in those movies she could act. How many times must we rehash the same old boring and tacky jokes? 1/10 "}]
