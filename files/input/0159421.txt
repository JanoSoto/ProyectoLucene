When Elmo goes to get it back he gets sucked into Grouchland where he has his blanket taken by the greedy and selfish Huxley.  Elmo goes after Huxley while his friends from Sesame Street venture into Grouchland to find him.As the rest of the world do, I love little Elmo.  The cuddliest and cutest of the Sesame Street gang, Elmo is hard to dislike and it is fun to spend 60 minutes in his company.  The plot has a nice moral behind it, one of not being selfish with one's possessions, and it delivers it without ramming it down your throat - in fact younger children won't even see it!What the children will see is a collection of colourful characters who are pretty funny and encourage audience interaction all the way (which I think would have annoyed me in a cinema - but not on video).  The action is all very bright and fun and has dialogue that will please both kids and adults, but without having stuff going low and high - it's all down the middle and easy to watch.  The musical numbers are all very catchy and mostly quite fun.  The Trash Queen's song is catchy but has a touch of the divas about it that seems out of place, but other than that there isn't really a bum note among them.The Sesame Street characters are all as fun as usual.  Ernie and Bert could have got a little irritating with their interruptions but they carry it off well enough.  The film is Elmo's of course and he is so sweet it's easy to go along with him.  Patinkin is a great villain and I enjoyed him immensely. Williams has a brief role and does OK but doesn't have too much to do with herself other than look FABULOUS in a clingy outfit that shouldn't be allowed in a kids' movie!Overall this is a colourful and fun movie, which is easy to watch for both adults and children.  The songs are like the characters - fun and colourful. It's all a bit short but it is amusing and well worth seeing if you've got young children to keep happy.

Elmo has this blanket that he loves very much, and after a tug-of-war with Zoe, Oscar the Grouch tosses the blanket after he blows his nose with it. Where does it goes, in Grouchland. On Sesame Street, there was a place called GrouchyTown. In this movie, Grouchland is being run by a really rude man named Huxley(Mandy Patankin). He the worst person to be around. When Elmo goes to Grouchland to retrieve his blanket, he meets some unusual characters there. He meets a girl grouch who his nothing like the others. Very kind, very neat, and very cooperative. Mostly grouches hate cooperation, even Oscar can bend the rules of his kind. When he was a resident there, he knew what it's like. So he got the grouches there to change their attitude's, and their ways a bit. Anthor character in the movie is the Queen of Trash(Vanessa L. Williams). I liked the part where Elmo had to do 100 Raspberries. She was also a friendly person there. This movie deals with sharing, while Follow that Bird deals with diversity. This movie is very good for kids, as well, and other generations to come. Rating 3 out of 5 stars!

(Spoiler Warning #3) When Elmo's Sesame Street pals learn that Elmo has jumped into Oscar's trash can, some of them, Big Bird, etc jumped in after him.

The underlying message, that sharing is good, may seem juvenile in scope simply because it is a Sesame Street production and includes blue and red fuzzy monsters and talking turnips, but applies to everyone.         Being a 21 year year old, I particularly liked the scene where Vanessa Williams emerged in a pretty provacative outfit made of trash (yeah!). Nevertheless, EIG contains a valuable theme that I wish more people would follow.           Teletubbies and Pokemon have stomped their way into our culture, but are a mere fad, and the more reserved and prestigious Sesame Street has not lost a step.

Director Gary Halvorson develops a colorful new world but the story is limited segments or episodes to test Elmo as he draws closer to his prize. Why Patinkin needs Elmo's blanket is something only a psychiatrist can answer but he is perfectly cast and never talks down at viewers. Vanessa Williams plays the Queen of trash given a lame task against Elmo but she manages to glimmer and be of good sport. Veteran performers from Sesame Street including Roscoe Orman as Gordon, Bob McGrath as Bob, and Sonia Manzano as Maria make appearances from the popular show and overact horribly.

Basically Elmo the furry red monster (Kevin Clash) loves his fuzzy blue blanket and would never let anything happen to it, however when Zoe the furry yellow-orange monster (Fran Brill) wants to play with it they get in a tug-of-war, and it rips, Elmo angry declares Zoe is no longer his friend. Suddenly Telly the furry red-violet monster (Martin P. Robinson) inadvertently causes the blanket to land in the hands of Oscar the Grouch (Caroll Spinney), and Elmo trying to retrieve it is teleported through the trashcan into Grouchland, a place full of grouchy creatures. Elmo has to muster up all the determination and courage he can to on an action mission to find his beloved blanket, and along the way he meets many grouchy characters, good and bad. The blanket has ended up in the hands of the villainous greedy man named Huxley (Homeland's Mandy Patinkin), who lives at the top of Mount Pickanose, he has collected many objects and treasures, but he never shares them with anybody. Elmo gets a little help from a girl named Grizzy (Stephanie D'Abruzzo) and he meets the Queen of Trash (Ugly Betty's Vanessa Williams), meanwhile the other Sesame Street residents are made aware that Elmo is missing and try to find a way to get him back, but some mean characters may be getting in their way. In the end Elmo eventually reaches Huxley, and he gets his treasured blanket back, in his journey he has learnt that things should be shared, he apologises to his friend Zoe and allows her to share his blanket. Throughout the film there is commentary from Bert (Frank Oz) and Ernie (Steve Whitmire), where they will often pause the film and act worried about what is going to happen next, but they will assure the audience that everything will be fine. Also starring Roscoe Orman as Gordon, Bob McGrath as Bob, Alison Bartlett-O'Reilly as Gina, Ruth Buzzi as Ruthie, Emilio Delgado as Luis, Loretta Long as Susan, Caroll Spinney as Big Bird, Frank Oz as Grover and Cookie Monster, Jerry Nelson as Count Von Count, Dave Goelz as Humongous Chicken and Steve Whitmire as Stuckweed. Elmo with his falcetto voice, referring to himself by name and naivety is cute, Bert and Ernie chipping in is amusing, and it was nice to see the other many Muppet characters I recognise, e.g. Big Bird, Grover, Count Von Count, Telly, but this film is definitely much more for the younger audience, they will enjoy the songs and learning some things, but the adults watching may find it perhaps silly, slightly predictable, partly annoying and overly mushy, but it is a family friendly film, a very average musical adventure.

Unfortunately his blanket gets torn by Zoe and falls into Oscar's trashcan. When Elmo tries to retrieve it, he gets sucked into an unknown land called Grouchland (that is, Grouchland, USA). Elmo finds that his blanket has been stolen by the evil Huxley. He seems to think that he can take whatever he wants and claim it as his own, and that's exactly what he did with Elmo's blanket. Elmo won't stand for it, and goes through a series of events - including meeting the Queen of Trash and running into a giant chicken - to get his blanket back.There's nothing really bad about this movie. It's your typical Sesame Street movie with your favorite Sesame Street characters, both humans and Muppets. There are some nice morals about sharing and friendship, and it's just a nice, innocent story with your favorite childhood characters. I'm not as big a fan of this movie now as I was, but, again, that just has to do with age. And despite the fact that I'm not as big a fan of it, I still like it enough that I'd watch it every now and then.

The film begins with Sesame Street stalwarts Bert and Ernie, our hosts for the evening, breaking the fourth wall to greet the audience and introduce the feature presentation. We, the audience, are asked to count backwards from ten so that the film may begin; in keeping with the spirit of the viewing, I acquiesced. Our hosts regularly interrupt the main story whenever our hero's predicament is looking particularly dire, probably to remind the younger viewers that a happy ending is just around the corner. Then Bert gets excited about the closing credits.The meat of the film centres on that adorable reddish monster Elmo (Kevin Clash), who wakes up one morning and begins to sing about his beloved blanket. (Bizarrely, Elmo's bedroom features just one recognisable feature &#x96; a giant poster of Tiger Woods). When he accidentally travels to the mystical Grouchland (via a '2001'-like wormhole accessed through Oscar the Grouch's bachelor pad), he loses his blanket to the sinister self-proclaimed villain Huxley (Mandy Patinkin), a human with bushy eyebrows and a desire to steal anything that isn't his. A frustrated Elmo strikes out to retrieve his prized blanket, getting occasional help from various creatures and even the audience members. I know what it's like to lose a treasured possession. In fact, my dad threw away my favourite stuffed toy, for which I have never really forgiven him. Elmo's epic journey through Grouchland helps him to learn that material possessions are not everything, but the heartwarming finale is nevertheless rewarding in a predictable, slightly fluffy way. Movie references are abundant 'Titanic (1997),' 'Gone with the Wind (1939)' and 'Doctor Zhivago (1965)' are offered by pessimist Bert as movies without a happy ending. They crafty larrikins at Jim Henson Pictures even managed to work in a reference to 'Basic Instinct (1992),' with the Grouchland cinema screening the picture with the title Basically, It Stinks.

We see many qualities children posses that we as adults lack at times, determination, love for our enemies and working for what we want. I think Mandy Patinkin makes just the right kind of villain for a children's program, with just the right amount of meanness and humor to not make it too scary.

Elmo needs to retrieve his blanket from Huxley's castle and encounters a series of difficulties along the way, including a meeting with the Queen of Trash, played by Vanessa Williams, who teaches him about giving.I am 22 and I enjoyed it, particularly the musical parts, especially the signs in Grouchland, e.g. a movie theatre Sharon Groan in Basically It Stinks, and the self-deprecating comments about the show - Huxley, I bet you have a grand old time together just saying the alphabet and counting *all day long*.  Grouchland saying - you look like a million yuks.  In jail, some people are told, you have the right to scream you head off, and if you don't exercise that right, you can have someone scream their head off for you.Grouchland is like a ghetto, so the producers had to be careful to avoid any racist suggestions at that point (witness outcry over Phantom Menace).  The background music is a Latin/ South American rhythm.  Also the Queen of Trash's dump has an African/Andean rhythm with the pipes in the background.More disturbing was the incipient bourgeois mentality displayed; apparently we are supposed to not like the ghetto dwellers or the people who have everything (i.e. the socialist, Huxley). If this film was made in any country except the US, recycling would have been mentioned...Postmodernist views are also blatantly promulgated in the Queen of Trash's song concerning her dump (or creation?) It's all about your point of view.Bert and Ernie often break in and get the audience to participate.  They are very fond of using each others names in their conversation, e.g. in just about every sentence.  Another strange thing is that Elmo refers to himself in the third person all the time.

I could sense the this is a bad idea but I have to honor my contract in every single performance by the Sesame Street regulars.My daughter was in absolute tears when the blanket got taken away . .and why not?  The movie has just branded on to your brain that Elmo must NEVER be seperated from his blanket.  So, why in the name of all things good and innocent, would the movies writers, directors, and producers IMMEDIATELY take away his blanket and thrust it into the hands of an evil person who towers over the muppets?  This is sadistic film making at its worst . ..ELMO IS FOR PRE-SCHOOLERS!Huxley, the greedy villian (who is tagged on the packagin with the innocent sounding doesn't like to share) is very ominous, and taunts Elmo with the blanket and makes fun of his tears.  Unbelievable.I didn't get past this part as my daughter was in sobs at this point . .and despite my fast forwarding to the end to show her that Elmo gets his Blanket back . . I could do little to save the evening.While I fast forwarded I could see that the rest of the movie was filled with threats, intimidation, and flat out picking on little defenseless kids. Muppets in cages!!!??? OUTRAGEOUS!!!The makers of this movie should be ashamed of themselves for violating the spirit of Elmo and Sesame Street for creating a movie that will certainly scare little ones and make them cry.This is a poorly written, ill-concieved bit of film making.  Grouchland is indeed smelly and trashy .  . .and so is this movie.

Anyway, I decided to rent this movie to give her a little treat, and she loved the dickens out of it.I, on the other hand...Well, I can't say I didn't like it, necessarily.  The production values are pretty decent, and muppets look a lot better when shot on film instead of the video they use for Sesame Street.  But hearing Elmo's voice for the length of a feature film just gets to be a bit much.  It's much better when contained to the 20-minute Elmo's World segment on the show.Thankfully, the film does provide a few breaks from Elmo's squeaking, including a joyously evil song from Mandy Patinkin and a fairly boring one from Vanessa Williams.But don't expect anything of Pixar quality as far as the screenplay goes.  This one is geared only for kids, and the laughs for adults are few and far between.  And since it's only for kids, and my daughter loved it, I have to say it succeeded in its mission.

The story takes so long being slow and simple, it literally bored me into a stupor.  The songs are instantly forgettable, the TV cast looks ill at ease, and the whole thing is shot on a soundstage with a budget that might cover my lunch this afternoon.  I give this a 3, and hope your child is not turned off from Elmo by this.

Elmo in Grouchland lacked charisma and spark, I think. Don't get me wrong, every one tried their best, and the message about sharing was good, and Bert and Ernie's commentary was very funny. It just didn't really gell.By the way, I saw Bob, Maria, Gordon, Luis, etc. (in this movie) for the first time in years. They have not aged at all! They look great, exactly how I'd remembered them. It was great to see them all again!

In trying to differentiate the movie from a typical Sesame Street episode, the creators produced a dull generic children's movie that lacks both the educational and entertainment qualities of the TV series.  The movie also lacks any spontaneity and the genuine-feel often found with the small children on the television show.

This movie is 1 of the cutest movies I've seen, im in my 20's and I thought it was so adorable, beats any other kids movie I've seen. Please, if any1 is going to rate a kids movie, make sure they know what they're talking about. Such stupid people out there...stupid 'so called' critics. I wonder what sort of car they drive or what their wives look like... yea exactly.. thats all i have to say really to make up for the 10 so called lines.. It may have made New Year's celebrations a little damp, but the rain that greeted revellers in some Australian cities was still welcome.And Australians will be hoping for more of it in 2007 to break the nation's drought, which experts have called the worst in 100 years.Despite the rain, hundreds of thousands of revellers attended traditional fireworks displays, concerts and dances around the country. It seemed revellers heeded warnings to behave, with police around the nation reporting few major problems.Most people in major cities also used public transport to avoid traffic problems.The country's biggest fireworks display - possibly the world's biggest - centred on the Sydney Harbour Bridge.More than a million people gathered along the harbour foreshore and on the water to watch the two fireworks shows.Children dressed up for the family show at 9 pm, whose theme was The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.The midnight fireworks show, which was billed as the biggest and best to date, lasted 13 minutes and featured pyrotechnics displays off CBD buildings, the bridge and harbourside locations.On his first visit to Sydney, New Zealander Quintin Thomas, 27, of Wellington, said he'd seen the best night in the world.It's the best New Year's I've ever had, Mr Thomas said.I saw it on TV and had to come and check it out.Fireworks off the buildings, off everything - that's class.More than 1,500 police patrolled popular Sydney areas including the Rocks, Circular Quay, Darling Harbour, Manly, Coogee and Bondi.In Canberra, the fireworks display went ahead despite major storms.An ACT police spokesman said a couple of thousand people gathered in the Civic district for fireworks and concerts.DJs entertained younger crowds, while a Beatles cover band played in the city's central square, Garema Place.In Melbourne there were record crowds of about 450,000 in the city despite rainy weather.About 50,000 attended a party at Federation Square and there were six party sites around the city, offering free entertainment.

But is he good enough to base an entire movie around? Sorry but no. The movie misses its target and the message of the movie is too muddled.Most kids will probably find this movie not to be entertaining and stimulating enough. Therefor, The movie misses its targeted audience. Bert & Ernie seem like a last minute addition by the filmmakers to conceal- and distract from the scary parts of the movie. Grouchland shall not seem like a very nice place to go to, for young children. Huxley is a too scary and serious villain for a movie like this.Of course it's no Muppet movie and the movie is filled with only characters from Sesame Street but also on its own, as a children's movie it isn't a very good one. Elmo's adventure is very dull and the songs in the movie are quite poor. Obviously the movie tries to send out a message to the children and tries to learn them sometime but it isn't handled exactly very well in the script and movie with as a result that the message doesn't really come trough.Visually the movie looks like a children's movie but all of the dialog is only really fun for adults. There are some good jokes in the movie.It's far from a horrible movie but the story and the end result, almost completely misses its target.5/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"73 minutes of my life wasted","Date":"1 September 2004","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":"  I've seen Elmo in Grouchland only once, and I realised in the first scene that the next 73 minutes of my life would be wasted watching this trash (mind you, no offence to Oscar).Obviously done at a time when Elmo suddenly became the over-cute star of Sesame Street (or should that be Elmo Street now?), it lacks the originality of what Sesame Street was really like before the 90s (compared with Follow That Bird done fourteen years earlier).I wonder why the Children's Television Workshop (sorry, the SESAME Workshop <sarcasm>) had even bothered to do a movie for such a stupid character.I'm so frustrated, I have no choice but to give it a big fat ZERO out of ten.

This movie is geared to the typical Seasame Street set of 2 to 8 year olds.  Although the story line deals with lessons in sharing, we see Elmo lose his blanket to an evil fellow in Grouchland.  If your kids have a favorite blanket this will hit too close to home.  The producers added commentary by Bert and Ernie after the movie proved too frightening.  The Bert and Ernie bits do lighten things up a bit but it is too scary.  The movie has the usual great sets, puppets etc. but it is not for the 2 to 8 year old set.  Go figure. "}]
